They made the cover of the magazine in 2006 before having even released an EP, presumably on the strength of their black cotton-candy haircuts and their media connections. And they debuted first single ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxS95trd6kc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sheena Is a Parasite</a>"" with an equally uncommon assist from director Chris Cunningham, who had previously done his unsettling, special effects heavy work for more musical outliers such as Aphex Twin and Autechre.</p>
<p>But if the Horrors' high profile debut was baffling, their follow-up moves were encouraging. They spoofed themselves with an appearance on an episode of the British comedy ""The Mighty Boosh"", as a band called the Black Tubes, in an episode revolving around protagonist Vince Noir trying to squeeze into a pair of impossibly skinny jeans so he can join the band. They quickly shed the campy, dark garage shocks of debut <i>Strange House</i>, announced a sophomore album produced by Portishead's Geoff Barrow and Cunningham (the latter resulting in a lot of ""cinematic"" talk despite his decidedly claustrophobic small-screen style), and started stretching out their sound to accommodate eight-minute krautrock jams. This is perhaps the best you can hope for from your rising rock stars: a willingness to laugh at oneself and a will to evolve.</p>
<p><i>Skying</i> continues the evolution set in motion 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12998-primary-colours/"" target=""_blank""><i>Primary Colours</i></a>, but with an emphasis on melody and pop form. This time, the band recorded and produced in their own studio, crafting a sound that recalls both the gothic pomp of 80s new wave and the big-screen dreaming of early-90s shoegaze, just as it was beginning to transform into chart-conquering Britpop. That the record can be heard as a catalogue of influences is nothing new for this outfit. They've routinely been tagged as ""record collector rock"" for their unabashed aping of influences from the Cramps to Can-- and indeed their well-selected covers indicate a group that has spent some time in record shops.  <i>Skying</i> isn't likely to change that perception. The insistent chorus and Badwan's breathy delivery on ""I Can See Through You"" comes off like the Psychedelic Furs run through the effects rack of My Bloody Valentine. ""Monica Gems"" nods to Suede with its decadent guitar swirl and Badwan's moaning sighs. On ""Endless Blue"", a horn section pops in for the floating intro as if borrowed from a James Bond theme by way of Blur or ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXbLyi5wgeg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">This Is Hardcore</a>"" before the song abruptly surges into an impressive rock nosedive. The debts owed here are obvious, but the taste is impeccable, and the application is more often than not convincing.</p>
<p>There are moments when the band stretches out past seven minutes and opts for something more impressionistic, like the hypnotic ""Moving Further Away"" and the reclining-then-softly-erupting album closer ""Oceans Burning"", but the Horrors seem otherwise content to craft solid, emotionally inflected rock songs here. Lead single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12252-still-life/"" target=""_blank"">Still Life</a>"" sets the tone in that regard, with an appealing bucolic stupor, rhythm section keeping half time, synths seeping backwards, and frontman Faris Badwan singing in a low, foggy voice that holds its spot high in the mix as easily as it drifts away on the chorus. That it brings to mind Simple Minds and, by extension, teen angst of the John Hughes variety, is by no means a negative.</p>
<p>Both Badwan's voice and the band's production have made some strides here: He sounds surer behind the microphone than ever, and the band's guitars and synths are frequently smoothed of shrieks into one great blur, the black eyeliner watered down and smudged into a gray cloud. So while they may have started out as all glittering surfaces, the Horrors have evolved into a dependable band making wide-reaching rock music. Whether a calculated retreat or just a natural maturation, the Horrors have found a sound more content with background and atmosphere, and it suits them nicely.</p></div>"|15645.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15645-skying/|7.5|Eric Grandy

They looped producer Darkchild's synth-harp intro from that 1998 hit and let it ride for about two minutes, turning it into a mediative electronic groove. The Los Angeles duo thrives on this type of sonic ""aha!"" moment, finding musical cues that expose the ways that mainstream rap and R&amp;B aren't all that different from what's going on in the more explicitly experimental underground. Producers making footwork, Baltimore club, moombahton, post-dubstep, and more are toying with minimalism, repetition, and noise; but the urban music on the radio can similarly blow minds, and is often just as out-there.</p>
<p>This isn't a new concept exactly (Timbaland at his peak was clearly an avant-pop genius), but Nguzunguzu are particularly skilled at bringing together disparate sounds-- as if their brains were missing the part that constructs binaries or identifies genre differences. They brought this to bear earlier this year when they stitched together M.I.A.'s demos and one-offs for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14970-vicki-leekx/""><i>Vicki Leekx</i></a>, making something just as jagged as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14434-y/""><i>/\/\/\Y/\</i></a>, but way more more fun to hear.</p>
<p>The only tangible divide in their work seems to be the conscious splitting up of how they approaching mixing and producing. While their mixes and live sets confidently bounce between genres with ease, their EPs (a self-titled one and <i>Mirage </i>from last year, and now, <i>Timesup</i>) have a different focus. <i>Timesup</i>'s three songs and two remixes (by Kingdom and Total Freedom) don't deliver on the vibrant promise of <i>Perfect Lullaby</i>, but they aren't really supposed to do that. The fascinating and sometimes frustrating thing about this group is the unresolved tension between their wide-eyed, creative DJ mixes and their often insular original tracks.</p>
<p>A good example here is ""Timesup"", which runs on an eerie, arpeggiated synth line, a cracking whip, and a baby cooing (homage to Timbaland's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M9BgfSHowg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Are You That Somebody?""</a> beat, no doubt). In the middle, in lieu of dance breakdown, there is, for a few moments, a vocal sample from <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/bmore-djpierre/dj-pierre-let-me-get-that"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Let Me Get That""</a> by the awesome but unknown Baltimore club producer DJ Pierre, and right there is the Nguzunguzu recipe: mixing cutting-edge pop fighting with hyper-regional dance. ""Water Bass Power"" features a dark, menacing synth line that gets louder and louder before circling its melody, while vocal snippets, the ping! of a knife being unsheathed, and dub reggae noises clatter and stomp around. ""Wake Sleep"" slinks along like an Aaliyah single that never was, piling on increasingly avant-garde percussive noises (an opera sample, drips of water) and teasing the gorgeous hum of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIcmIhOesaI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Art of Noise's ""Moments In Love""</a>. It's difficult but rewarding stuff.</p>
<p>A recent mix by the group for <i>XLR8R</i> however, features all of the music on <i>Timesup</i> and places it in conversation with the world of post-global dance at large. ""Wake Sleep"" talks to a sad-sack chipmunk soul remix of ""Moments in Love"" (Jodie's ""Moments in Heartbreak (LOL Boys Edit)""); the title track provides an extended intro for ""Everyday"", a Chicago juke jam from DJ Deeon; and a raucous Baltimore club-like track called ""Deep Inside Me Groove"" announces the arrival of ""Water Bass Power"". Because their mixes are so effective, it's tempting to think of Nguzunguzu's standalone releases as track-oriented DJ tools. But<i> Timesup </i>is living, breathing music that appears to be forming as it goes along. Here, strange sound effects and samples are stacked on top of each other, teasing total chaos but ultimately staying on track because of the foresight of two producers who know exactly what they're doing.</p></div>"|15660.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15660-timesup-ep/|7.6|Brandon Soderberg

Keyboardist Peter Pearson has served as an apprentice under Pink Floyd's live sound producer. Before guitarist Toshio Masuda moved from Japan to America, he produced hip-hop, commercials, and soundtracks, and even performed with a boy band. Violinist and lead singer Emilie Friedlander founded the blog <a href=""http://www.visitation-rites.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Visitation Rites</a> and is currently the editor of Pitchfork's sister site Altered Zones. Together, they make a kind of swirling electronic dream-pop that defies easy categorization.</p>
<p>Each member's background is represented equally on <i>Actually</i>, where rap beats nestle comfortably with ambient effects and violins squall around laser-like synthesizers. ""LYNY"", the album's most straightforward song, combines electronic blips  and beeps with crashing live drums and swirling guitars to create a  colorful, engrossing opener. The disparate elements on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14359-heyo-silver-morning/"" target=""_blank"">Heyo (Silver Morning)</a>""-- the metallic clang punctuating every downbeat, the submerged guitars sounding like they're being played in aquarium-sized fish tanks, the blaring violin line-- come together in a natural way. Given the way the band members worked in music individually, it's no surprise that <i>Actually</i> sounds great on a pair of quality headphones.</p>
<p>Delivered at languid tempos, the longer-form songs often feel like they're floating, a vibe that ""FAO"" particularly captures, all of its parts coasting in multiple directions. On such an exploratory album, highlight ""Mr. Broken Bird"" is where the band comes closest to delivering an anthemic pop tune. ""Too many rock stars, not enough gangsters,"" Friedlander sings, as a variety of synth sounds flutter, twitch, and burst with life beneath her propulsive live drums. The song feels a lot shorter than its nearly six-minute running time.</p>
<p>Album closer ""Musica"" slows to a snail's pace as the band gradually shifts from textural subtlety to climactic guitar work, its loose structure making way for a stretch of improvisation that has grounding in both noise and psychedelic music. This 11-minute track, like most of the songs on <i>Actually</i>, finds a way to toe the line between the synthetic and the organic. Using the breadth of their musical language, La Big Vic manage to create a strand of experimental music that is as wide-spanning in feeling as it is in sound.</p></div>"|15602.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15602-actually/|7.3|Martin Douglas

This wouldn't be noteworthy save for the fact that <i>Room(s)</i> is an electronic album, one (presumably) devoid of its creators voice. Instead, it is stuffed to the gills with harping, distended vocal samples deployed in hypnotic, overlapping curlicues. This style of sample, popularized by UK bass music, at this point has become prevalent enough that it represents modernity-- the sound of contemporary electronic music-- more than any one genre. Still, Machinedrum's Travis Stewart approaches this trend like a glutton. Where peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=jacques+greene&amp;search_type=standard"" target=""_blank"">Jacques Greene</a> apply these samples in precise, painterly strokes, Stewart gloms them onto the canvas with abandon. In doing so, he seems to suggest that their accumulation, more than their placement or timbre, provides the necessary weight and mysticism.</p>
<p>Stewart enjoys these kind of tactful reactions. He's spent 10 years releasing music under the Machinedrum moniker, much of it worthwhile, much of it in widely varying styles of electronic composition, from IDM to deep house and back. Bass music is Stewart's current muse: Earlier this year he released the excellent <i>Fleur</i> 12"" as half of Sepalcure (whose other half, Praveen Sharma, released one of the better bass singles of the year, ""The Year 3000"", as Braille). On <i>Room(s)</i> he takes bass music's vocal samples and strips them of their candor, the sense that they are disassociated from the tech-y fray. They become globs of sound, the primary element around which these tracks are constructed.</p>
<p>A collection of active, grazing drum patterns and warm keyboards holds these gobs together. Stewart manages a fair range of styles-- from the pounding, piano-house of ""Come1"" to the opiate shadows of ""Youniverse""-- though nothing escapes those contorted yelps. Those samples-- ululating, detuned, hypnotic-- normalize everything on <i>Room(s)</i>, to the point where vastly different tracks are tonally similar. Sometimes, such as on ""GBYE"", he succeeds using short, eager samples, colliding two or three voices together dozens of times in quick succession. The tracks that stray furthest from dance music fare the best: ""Sacred Frequency"" (itself a single, with excellent B-sides, for the record) veers into the gleaming psychedelia of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/"" target=""_blank"">Caribou</a>, while ""Now U Know the Deal 4 Real"" touches on cold, assertive R&amp;B.</p>
<p>I want to stress how many listens it takes to suss out even these differences. It's not that they're not real, it's that the shivering vocal timbres dominate the mix to the point where large shifts in tempo and style are obscured. It's during these moments when I think that <i>Room(s)</i> and its elevation of the vocal sample was perhaps a better idea than an album. Still, if you're the type of person who feel hard for Greene's ""Another Girl"" or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>'s shaky ghosts, there's enough hyper-melodic, mush-mouthed whir on <i>Room(s)</i> to reward your time.</p>

Or, at a minimum, you respect the man even if he really hasn't done much worth a shit in the past 15 years or so. This shouldn't be a problem except there's probably no pop music figure of the past century whose universal acclaim is matched by an almost total inability of his acolytes to create proper homage. We come across respectable integrations of Bowie, Dylan, Lennon, and Brian Wilson, but-- especially amongst rock musicians who use the Purple One's legacy as their mainline to R&amp;B-- the whole of his work is often distilled into a falsetto and a bunch of terrible sexual puns. Well, if <a href=""http://official-inc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Inc.</a> prove anything on their 4AD debut EP <i>3</i>, it's that you can plunder the lesser-known regions of his discography, boast impressive instrumental chops, and still be no better off than some hapless power trio trying to rip off ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MS70tCPP-_4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Little Red Corvette</a>"".</p>
<p><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]--> At its core, Inc. (formerly known as Teen Inc. during their particularly galling <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/news/40495-cmj-2010-saturday-report-la-sera-teen-inc-sweet-bulbs-fergus-geronimo-no-joy/"" target=""_blank"">2010 CMJ set</a>) is comprised of Los Angeles-based brothers Daniel and Andrew Aged, both of whom are experienced session musicians. Which shows, not so much in the sense that <i>3</i> displays their virtuosity as much as their keytar-swinging live show, though there are plenty of geeky timestamps and frilly synth doodles. It's more in how its overcooked arrangements bear the mark of backup players overcompensating after finally getting ahold of the mixing console, and <i>3</i> turns out to be a maximalist grotesquerie of minimal sounds. ""Heart Crimes"" wanders around in search of a tune or even a beat for nearly five minutes while occasionally busying itself with Three 6 Mafia's 32nd-note hi-hats, vocal snippets that drift like paper bags in the wind, and synth slap-bass presets so offbeat they sound more like Spike Jones sound effects. This may not be particularly shocking, but mixing all of those elements turns out to be a total fucking disaster.</p>
<p>Slightly more successful are the two tracks that play with straightforward melody. At first glance, the arrhythmic hook of ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15885-swear/"" target=""_blank"">Swear</a>"" ingratiates due to its own nagging repetition, but if you're steeped enough in the realm of 1980s radio pop to appreciate Inc.'s simulacra, odds are you'll eventually recognize it as a pretty brazen rip of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0qBaBb1Y-U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sussudio</a>"". Not that there's anything inherently wrong with ""Sussudio"", but once that connection is made, it can never go back to being ""Swear"". ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16002-millionairess/"" target=""_blank"">Millionairess</a>"" sounds like a way out of their own rut, or at least a chance to bat one-for-three, but they abandon its quick-hitting chorus for a mess of vocal mutations that barely acknowledge a slowly simmering New Jack Swing beat. Credit where it's due for trying to enter Zapp &amp; Roger and Andre Cymone into the PBR&amp;B conversation without being total ironists, but ""Chromeo, except no fun at all"" isn't what the game's been missing.</p></div>"|15661.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15661-3-ep/|4.8|Ian Cohen

The 24-year-old is a Compton native with a budding and mysterious Dr. Dre connection, but there's little-to-no link to his hometown's gangsta-funk legacy in his music. Instead, Lamar is very much a product of the late blog-rap era-- an introverted loner type who's willing to talk tough but is more interested in taking a Mag-Lite to his own personal failings and what he sees as the flaws of his generation. His rap style is fluid and melodic but approachable, and his frantic tumble of syllables evokes the feeling when you're high enough that your thoughts arrive fast and interrupt each other. If one of the Bone Thugs guys had a dorky, overly sincere younger cousin who was really into Afrobeat and Terrence Malick movies, it'd be Kendrick.</p>
<p>Lamar does exist within a strong West Coast continuum, but it has nothing to do with Dre. Instead, he's very much within the tradition of 90s groups like Souls of Mischief or the Pharcyde-- self-deprecating and insanely talented kids who routinely ripped dizzy, slip-sliding flows over mellow jazz breaks. <i>Section.80</i>, Lamar's new album, arrives on a wave of blog-based buzz, but beyond a couple of ill-advised choruses, it doesn't make much attempt to present Lamar to major-label A&amp;Rs or to a wider audience. Instead, it gives him a chance to chase his muse wherever it runs. The production, mostly from relative unknowns like THC and Sounwave, is almost uniformly excellent-- a spaced-out blur of astral horns and blissed-out Fender Rhodes, with drums that only knock when they need to. A couple of guys from Lamar's Black Hippy crew-- those guys <i>really</i> sound like Souls of Mischief when they get together-- show up, but the album isn't a guest-heavy affair. It's a young thinker attempting to describe the world as he sees it.</p>
<p>""You know why we crack babies cuz we born in the 80s,"" Lamar raps on the excellently emo relationship-song ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12262-adhd/"" target=""_blank"">A.D.H.D.</a>"", and that's a theme that comes up over and over. Everywhere he looks, Lamar sees generational symptoms of the kids who came from the era of crack and Ronald Reagan. When he looks around, Lamar sees self-hate, nihilism, institutionalized oppression. When he talks to girls, he sometimes recalls the supportively sincere Goodie Mob of ""Beautiful Skin"", actually counseling against cosmetics on ""No Make-Up (Her Vice)"": ""Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing?/ From heaven is where you got it from."" (Somehow, the redundant double-""from"" makes the sentiment all the more adorable.) And he also recognizes self-destructive tendencies in himself: ""I used to wanna see the penitentiary way after elementary/ Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me."" But it's not like he's some preacher/prophet figure; he says ""suck my dick"" often enough that it gets boring.</p>
<p>Given that Lamar is a talented and earnest young man with a lot to say and no big label nudging his music toward accessibility, it's only natural that he'd lose his way every once in a while. <i>Section.80</i> is an hour long, and it could drop probably a quarter of its running time without anyone missing anything. And certain moments just make me wince so hard, like this one, from ""Hol' Up"": ""I wrote this record while 30,000 feet in the air/ Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair/ If I could fuck her in front of all these passengers/ They'd probably think I'm a terrorist."" Those few lines add up to a repellent cauldron of horniness, persecution-complex fantasies, exhibitionism, and plain old youthful Bad Idea Jeans indulgence. Dre hasn't yet taught Lamar how to hone all his best ideas into a few absolutely killer pieces of music; maybe he still will. But self-serious flaws and all, <i>Section.80</i> still stands as a powerful document of a tremendously promising young guy figuring out his voice. Its best moments (""Rigamortis"", ""HiiiPower"", ""Kush &amp; Corinthians"", ""A.D.H.D."") are simply dope as fuck, no qualifiers necessary.</p></div>"|15653.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15653-section80/|8.0|Tom Breihan

In the world of 21st-century harsh noise, Dominick Fernow's one-man recordings have been among the harshest, the most physical, the least compromising. Earlier albums, like 2006's hellishly screeching <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9694-pleasure-ground/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pleasure Ground</i></a>, were overwhelming floods of feedback and heavy psychic ugliness. Like the earliest industrial music, Prurient's records were more than sonically off-putting. They felt pained, beyond urgent, the product of some need to loose inner turmoil into the world, coming as much from Fernow's body as his machines.</p>
<p><i>Bermuda Ground</i> isn't just pleasant by contrast with Prurient's old unholy racket. It's often actively enjoyable, albeit in a decidedly creepy way, rooted as much in familiar retro-rock moves as formless face-eating noise. Perhaps it's down to Fernow's time playing in the decidedly more accessible and anthemic synth-pop/post-punk act Cold Cave, but <i>Bermuda Drain</i> is full of distortion-free keyboard, perverse disco beats, moments of beauty, even hooks. Especially for those who feel they get enough aural abuse just walking down city streets, it's the first Prurient record they might throw on for reasons other than testing their pain threshold.</p>
<p>Which isn't to say it's <i>accessible</i>, necessarily.  It may owe more to the creeping dread of old synthesized horror flick scores than the splatterpunk intensity of exploitation gorefests, but <i>Bermuda Drain</i> still opens with the kind of scream and fried-circuit blast designed to clear the room of everyone but the hardcore. When he's not roaring like a metal frontman let loose on a rave tune (""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/Prurient%20-%20A%20Meal%20Can%20Be%20Made.mp3"" target=""_blank"">A Meal Can Be Made</a>""), Fernow's whispering in a way that feels intimate in a decidedly uncomfortable and icky way. And song titles like ""Let's Make a Slave"" should let you know that Fernow-the-songwriter isn't exactly penning happy-go-lucky new wave here.</p>
<p>Fernow's shrieking and quiet-loner monologues also give <i>Bermuda Drain</i> a real sicko intensity that's been lacking from the recent glut of ""dark"" early-1980s synth stuff. He has the sound down, somewhere between Factory Records sturm-und-drag and grotty old VHS-tape slasher soundtracks, but you could never accuse <i>Bermuda Drain</i> of being a slick or faceless attempt at mere nostalgia. Like the earlier Prurient records, it comes from a dark and personal place, less an exercise than an explusion. Fernow wants to shake you up, unnerve you, make you understand just how fragile ""beautiful"" music is, rather than simply make sure he gets the synth tones period-perfect.</p></div>"|15651.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15651-bermuda-drain/|7.0|Jess Harvell

Over the past half-century, the <i>Anthology</i> has become a neatly packaged stand-in for the whole of American folk music, despite its dubious legality (rights were finally cleared for the 1997 reissue) and hugely personal conception. The blues, country, and folk songs (most recorded in the 1920s and 30s) Smith chose to include range from the obscure (Uncle Eck Dunford) to the popular (the Carter Family), and are presented with an eye toward the metaphysical-- the so-called Celestial Monochord etched onto its cover is being tuned, after all, by the Hand of God.</p>
<p><i>The Anthology</i> is a stunning thing, disorienting and funny and sad and transcendent, but it's also limited by design; the collection's supposed snapshot of the American folk canon is as much a self-portrait as anything else. Now, over a half-century later, <i>To What Strange Place</i>-- a 3xCD box set compiled by another 78 collector, Ian Nagoski-- feels like a long-lost companion piece. Rather than defining folk music as a rural, indigent practice, Nagoski goes broader, offering up the Ottoman immigrant songs that animated American cities in the first half of the 20th century for inclusion in the same canon.</p>
<p><i>To What Strange Place</i> collects the work of musicians from Anatolia, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Levant who lived in the U.S. and recorded in New York City between World War I and the Depression (1916-1929), as culled from Nagoski's own collection (according to a recent <i>Washington Post</i> profile, he purchased most of the source records en masse, for $5, from some dudes paid to haul junk out of vacated row houses). None are sung exclusively in English, and nearly all nod to musical traditions likely unfamiliar to casual listeners. It's not particularly easy to absorb, at least at first-- the textures and instrumentation are foreign, the tempos are shifty, the voices often spastic. Ultimately, though, none of that matters: The immigrant experience, so rich with glee and terror and homesickness and hope, is expressed here in all its wild, universal glory, and if you listen hard enough, these songs start to sound as familiar-- and as American-- as ""This Land Is Your Land"".</p>
<p>The jewel of the set is Marika Papagika, a Greek immigrant and famed practitioner of Rebetiko (a Greek analogue of Ottoman café music) who apparently recorded over 225 records in the 1920s and eventually helmed her own club, Marika's, in New York. Nagoski included some of her work on his 2007 set <i>Black Mirror: Reflections in Global Musics 1918-1955</i>, but she gets more space here, and she deserves it: Papagika's voice is bold and otherworldly, a high, skewering whine that defies rote comparison. It feels desperate and pre-verbal, like a baby crying in the middle of the night, and with it Papagika communicates (un-self-consciously, and with unchecked fervor) a staggering range of emotion. ""Smyrneiko Minore"" is her best, strangest track; there's not much melody, just Papagika howling over piano and a bit of bowed strings (probably a violin), but the anguish in her voice is unforgettable.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it's the rawness of the performances that lingers. Tetos Demetriades' rendition of ""Miserlou""-- which Dick Dale transformed into an instrumental surf-rock staple in 1962-- is dark and ominous; Kanuni Garbis's ""Ouchak Canto Guzel Tourna"" is frantic and foreboding. There are expressions of joy here, too-- D. Perperian's ""Tamzara"" (a folk dance) is giddy and bright, an invitation to move.</p>
<p>With its many moods, <i>To What Strange Place</i> offers a small, telling glimpse of the immigrant existence, using only the songs they recorded here. It feels as essential to an understanding of American music as anything else.</p></div>"|15624.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15624-to-what-strange-place-the-music-of-the-ottoman-american-diaspora-1916-1929/|8.3|Amanda Petrusich

Originally an entrant in last year's Scottish Mental Health Arts and Film Festival, <i>First Edition</i> put its roster up to the task of exploring appropriate lyrical themes. Where N.W.A and Ice-T once took on violence, here James Graham (the Twilight Sad), Emma Pollock (the Delgados), Rod Jones (Idlewild), and Scott Hutchison (Frightened Rabbit) come together to promote mental health. Good cause and intentions aside, there's an irony to this bunch working on such a project. The Delgados crafted their masterpiece in large part by living up to its title of <i>Hate</i>, two of Idlewild's biggest hits are ""Little Discourage"" and ""Live in a Hiding Place"", while Frightened Rabbit had to go ahead and put a song on their last record called ""Not Miserable"" because there's no way you'd assume the opposite was the case unless clearly notified.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.fruittreefoundation.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fruit Tree Foundation</a> is rounded out by relatively obscure (at least in the U.S.) singer-songwriter types like Alasdair Roberts, Jill O'Sullivan, and Jenny Reeve. And for the most part, the songs here gravitate more toward their low-key and affable folkiness than the highwire bloodletting of the aforementioned. Recorded in a mere five days, these are largely acoustic and almost entirely off-the-cuff, showing their moving parts in an almost aggressive way: A good number of songs here begin with in-studio chatter (somewhat stilted back-and-forth about Glasgow and such), push through verses and choruses over static riffs and chord changes like they're in the progress of being written, and wander off into noodly guitar solos. Undoubtedly, <i>First Edition</i> was a fun project to record and I'm sure a welcome relief for most of those involved to sidestep the heft and expectations associated with their day jobs of supervising emotional powder kegs.</p>
<p>But while there's chemistry, there's little in the way of spark, and <i>First Edition</i>'s good intentions add up to a record that doesn't do anything upsetting. And as such, it just feels like a misuse of resources. If nothing else, it's proof enough that these guys are masters of technique and timbre as vocalists, rather than just ones with a weapons-grade emotional arsenal. Graham's richly burnished low register in particular sounds fantastic simmering over acoustic dirges completely free of feedback, yet it's worrisome that without the guitar squall and tortured, punishing lyrics, the Twilight Sad could conceivably veer toward the maudlin tearjerkers of the Swell Season. Likewise, Pollock's contributions to co-ed bashers like ""Singing For Strangers"" recast her as a chipper cheerleader, a weirdly deferential step down from her wearied but wise counterpoint to Alun Woodward. The Graham feature ""Favourite Son"" puts lumbering drums right up in the mix like the Twilight Sad, and ""I Forgot the Fall"" retains Hutchison's unmistakably plaintive melodicism, but both lack a crucial element of catharsis. Within <i>First Edition</i>'s context, Jones' ""All Gone But One"" is the hookiest and most forceful of the power-pop entries. Were it an Idlewild song, and it certainly could be, it would simply be a standard issue cut from one of their later LPs which found them getting less bookish and yet somehow also less edgy.</p>
<p>Maybe my expectations are skewed, but in a situation such as this-- basically, a planned vacation from having to front such lyrically self-flagellating outfits-- you might figure it'd be embraced as on opportunity to take more chances both sonically and thematically. It's a nice enough listen and surely you'll come out of the purchase feeling much better about yourself (which is pretty much never the outcome upon listening to anything these guys have put their name on in the past). But ultimately, even the most rip-roaring of the bunch simply sounding like low-stakes versions of what we've grown accustomed to.</p></div>"|15613.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15613-first-edition/|5.9|Ian Cohen

Chicago rapper David Cohn, who performs as <a href=""http://www.anticon.com/index.php?section=artist&amp;target=Serengeti%20and%20Polyphonic&amp;js=yes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Serengeti</a>, represents something of a return for the label. Following a 2009 collaborative record with producer and fellow Illinois native Polyphonic, Serengeti's first solo album for Anticon is an unflinching homage to an indie-rap template that has otherwise largely gone the way of the dodo.</p>
<p>Producing <i>Family and Friends </i>are enigmatic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4593-why/"" target=""_blank"">WHY?</a> frontman Yoni Wolf and ex-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/698-casiotone-for-the-painfully-alone/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Casiotone for the Painfully Alone""><span class=""misspell"">Casiotone</span> for the Painfully Alone</a> mastermind Owen Ashworth (now working as Advance Base), who provide a sparse but sometimes gripping backdrop for Cohn's stable of strange characters-- all down, a few out-- and their struggles. As an MC, Cohn is part broken rambler, part highly attuned people-watcher. He sounds like he could use a drink, but his easy, near-spoken-word delivery is nothing if not welcoming. If you're up for hearing about absentee junkie fathers or suburban malaise, Cohn has a barstool ready for you.</p>
<p>For such a conversational rapper, though, Cohn often makes it difficult to know exactly where you've landed in the conversation. Tracks like the free-associative ""A.R.P."", which finds the narrator taking DMT and later stubbing his toe, or the cryptic ""<a href=""http://www.alteredzones.com/posts/1358/serengeti-ha-ha/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ha-Ha</a>"", about falling in love with the girl at the hardware store, would benefit from a bit more coherence. And even when lucid, Cohn frequently has trouble living up to the cleverness of his own concepts. For every moment as arresting as UFC-fighter lament ""The Whip"", which pairs Cohn's workmanlike flow with spirit-crushing toy keyboard plinks, there are too many where the pieces fit awkwardly. The desperate ""PMDD"" pines hazily for a girl in a pharmaceutical ad, while the depressive title track echoes the famous ""Choose Life"" speech from <i>Trainspotting</i>, but both make their points a little clumsily.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Wolf and Ashworth each prove to be positive enablers, adding nuanced touches when things get a bit too ham-fisted. Base's chunky ""Ha-Ha"" could pass for a minimalist tUnE-yArDs track; Ashworth's soulful, lonely ""Dwight"" features carousel music piped in from the ends of the earth. Not quite stylistic opposites but still distinctly different, the two producers almost always make sure to stay on the same page, taking skeletal percussive tracks and shocking them with little flecks of light. But as with much of <i>Family and Friends</i>, that light seems to be just out of reach.</p></div>"|15639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15639-family-and-friends/|6.8|Zach Kelly

[25th Anniversary Edition]|9199.0|Megadeth|['Metal']|0.0|1.0|0.0|['Capitol']|2011-07-20 00:00:00|2011|2016-06-11 17:26:38.733303|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".m64y4do2kg.1.6:0.1.0.$15656/=1$15656.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>Like many bands in the 1980s metal underground, <a href=""http://www.megadeth.com/home.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Megadeth</a> were hugely successful while still essentially operating under pop's radar. Their abrasiveness, speed, gross-out extremity, and nasty humor essentially barred them from the airwaves in the days when people called <i>Slippery When Wet</i> a metal album with a straight face. Like their indie-label peers who'd come up out of hardcore, Megadeth built an audience by touring relentlessly, and when they were finally signed to a major, they became even more popular. And yet if you're reading this, you're under 30, and you don't consider yourself a metal fan, you might not know their music at all.</p>
<p>This is a sad thing. For the class of '86, a year that gave us Megadeth's <i>Peace Sells</i> and Metallica's <i>Master of Puppets </i>and Slayer's <i>Reign in Blood</i>, the refusal to go the Poison/Cinderella route was both a point of pride and what forever kept them cult acts. (Discounting Metallica, who conquered the world only to become a joke.) They were absolutely <i>huge</i> cult acts-- festival draws and elder statesmen still listened to by millions-- but cult acts nevertheless. So this reissue of <i>Peace Sells</i>, celebrating a quarter century of Megadeth's second but first truly great album, is probably more a sop to those diehards than anything else, but if it turns one curious party into a convert then it's worth it, even in this time of bald cash-grab reissue ugliness.</p>
<p>And there are many reasons why this album might still appeal to fence-sitters and folks turned off by extreme metal's very extremity. <i>Peace Sells</i> is a dead serious record that never takes itself too seriously, a slab of political shock commentary that's loaded with black comedy, and which treats Satan and ICBMs with the same awe because they're both great villains. Like most literate metalheads of his era, Megadeth leader Dave Mustaine was deeply spooked by the supposedly imminent threat of mutually assured destruction, a day-to-day possibility that those born after the cessation of Cold War hostilities might not understand. He was also plenty pissed over the non-nuclear atrocities of the Reagan years, along with the kind of bleak, man-against-the-universe shit that transcends presidential terms.</p>
<p>But Mustaine also understood he was working in an idiom that invariably turned the most serious material, from eschatology to existential despair, into thrilling, fist-pumping, head-banging Grand Guignol. He believed in peace but knew thrash metal wasn't particularly suited to depicting some hugs-and-kisses utopia. Nuclear war was as shit-your-pants real as fears got in 1986, but it also made for some great exploitation-flick imagery. And while the lyrics to ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD-NmKotI7U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Devil's Island</a>"" make their point about death row being a sad end for any human being, the music makes state-sponsored execution sound suspiciously awesome.</p>
<p>Megadeth had plenty of the grimy intensity of the cassette-trading bands that would give birth to death metal and all that followed, but they'd absorbed enough radio hard rock to not abjure things like memorable thuggish riffs, big shout-along triumphant choruses, and a rhythm section that could actually throw down on a groove without succumbing to the metal vice of momentum-killing displays of virtuosity. The bass hook that opens ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umeZtszNShk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peace Sells</a>"" is so instantly memorable that everyone who watched MTV in the late 80s and early 90s knows it even if they think they don't. This is a thrash record of course, and so there are solos galore, with Mustaine deep in the throes of technical ecstasy. But while drummer Gar Samuelson is no slouch in the chops department and songs shift tempos in seconds and plenty open with those noodly sturm-und-drang intros that made 80s metal so portentously great, the pummeling pace rarely lets up. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGagJervtMc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Good Mourning/Black Friday</a>"" takes a few minutes to rev up, but then it's like everything great about hardcore, plus a dose of the kind of show-off skill that makes lesser musicians' fingers bleed.</p>
<p>There's a drunken laugh-so-you-don't-cry attitude on <i>Peace Sells</i> that seemingly owes as much to Flipper as to Ozzy, especially on the title track, but that doesn't mean Mustaine was mocking his audience. Megadeth were always a metal band first and foremost, which meant never condescending to anyone for feeling helpless and hopeless, or for thinking death and destruction were simultaneously kinda cool and really not-cool. Like most metal heroes, Mustaine on <i>Peace Sells</i> identified deeply with the dead-end kids who bought his records, even if he could play better than 95% of them. The raw live set appended as a bonus disc to this reissue-- there's also a multi-disc version that features many different mixes of the original album that will probably be of interest strictly to those who've been living with it for years-- features a snarling and ferociously funny performance of ""Peace Sells"" that outdoes the album version in everything but fidelity. It's an all-time ode to feeling disenfranchised but at least knowing you can still write an epic screw-you song about that fact. Mustaine knew there was no point to making this stuff sound like a drag. Because if you did manage to survive another day, there was always another beer and another awesome metal record waiting for you, and sometimes that was enough.</p></div>"|15656.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15656-peace-sells-but-whos-buying-25th-anniversary-edition/|8.7|Jess Harvell

In addition to the rapper's recidivism issues and garish facial tattoos, his Brick Squad guest spots have been as inspiring as a game-six LeBron James performance. But by almost any standard, <i>Writings on the Wall II</i> is a major comeback. There are no weak tracks or unfortunate production choices, and Gucci's delivery, if not his lyrical content, retains its distinctive character. Musically, he's adapted his unique songwriting approach to a more aggro era, welcoming Brick  Squad mixtape mercenaries Lex Luger and Southside to the fold.</p>
<p>The new sonic strategy works as quick sleight of hand to distract from what could otherwise be some repetitive moments on a 70-minute rap record. It helps that the ever-versatile Drumma Boy produces the bulk of the record's back end. Drumma's highlight here, ""Translation"", ratchets up tension with simple, ascending piano lines, a trick the producer has used before. Few beatmakers can create a larger variance of ideas and moods with such minor modifications of a simple formula. (It may be no coincidence that Gucci's lyrical approach functions in a similar manner). His beat for 50 Cent feature ""Recently"" throws out the rulebook completely. A walking bass line transforms into a mind-warping rumble during the chorus, while an organ riff hits at unpredictable rhythmic angles, giving the entire song a frenetic tension. Southside takes some unexpected liberties, too, most impressively on ""Major"", where lightly tapped snare and exhaled background vocals create an odd sense of ominous delicacy. Fat Boy's ""Camera Ready"", the tape's standout, bears more similarity to recent Brick Squad tracks like producer Prince's epic ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-8eFGritK4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Like a Dream</a>"" than the typical Fat Boy sound (""Wasted"").</p>
<p>Lyrically, Gucci is considerably more generic now than during his memorable 2008-2009 run. Even when his flow hits its double-time stride, he's still falling back on trap-rap clichés. Missing are the moments of narrative power, like his verses on ""Frowney Face""; gone is the must-rewind imagery that used to dominate his tapes. Gucci acknowledges on ""Gucci Talk"" that he has returned to the ""no pad, no pencil"" style of his earlier work. But when 2008's <i>No Pad No Pencil </i>came out, everything Gucci was releasing seemed to push hip-hop's possibilities in new directions. <i>Writings on the Wall II</i> instead consolidates several song structures he has done before, wedding them to some (stunning) contemporary production. Gucci's lyrics weren't celebrated for their complexity, although he deployed that strategy on occasion. His lyrics' power stemmed from the imagery and humor he used to render in full color a world that for most rappers exists only in black and white. To the tape's considerable credit, Gucci disappoints here only when compared with himself.</p></div>"|15649.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15649-writings-on-the-wall-ii/|7.9|David Drake

That trend continues with <i>Vol. 7</i>, for which the label first approached Daniel Lopatin, aka <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>. Together they brainstormed a project involving minimalist composer David Borden. The latter's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Borden"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">résumé</a> is wide-- even including a mostly-unused score for <i>The Exorcist-- </i>but he's best known for founding the synth ensemble <a href=""http://mothermallard.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Company</a>. That group began in 1969 playing Moog versions of pieces by Terry Riley, Philip Glass, and Steve Reich. Soon they began composing their own music and experimenting with newer electronics, something they continue to do today.</p>
<p>Such openness to sounds and ideas comes through on the five pieces here, which are impressively varied despite being pretty uncomplicated. Part of that variety is due to the participants Lopatin brought into this session last August-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28709-james-ferraro/"">James Ferraro</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28822-laurel-halo/"">Laurel Halo</a>, and Samuel Godin, all open creative minds on their own. But what's most impressive about <i>Vol. 7</i> is how it never sounds like a mess of piled up activity, or five voices elbowing for room. If someone told you this was made by one person, you'd probably believe them. So it's not too far-fetched to guess that, for two days in the studio, these five became of one mind, joined by a simple sonic vision.</p>
<p>Perhaps Borden is just that forceful a musical personality, steering his comrades toward a very distinct set of goals. However these tracks came together, the unity of purpose is evident throughout. It starts from the very first seconds of opener ""People of the Wind Pt. 1"", a 12-minute drone that constantly builds and expands, marrying airy etherealness to dense guts in a way that recalls Stars of the Lid's best epics. From there, the ensemble winds through a range of moods and timbres. ""Internet Gospel Pt. 1"" warps like an underwater wedding processional; ""<a href=""http://soundcloud.com/igetrvng/frkwys07-people-of-the-wind-pt-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">People of the Wind Pt. 2""</a> adds a sense of galactic transmission to Pt. 1; and ""Twilight Pacific"" fuses Lopatin's flowing repetitions to Borden's Terry Riley-ish all-night-flight inclinations. All of this can get pretty spacey and drifting; you'll need some predilection for things like OPN, Emeralds, or the early Kranky roster to fully dig into such synthed-out pieces.</p>
<p>Stick with it, though, and you'll get rewarded by closer ""Just a Little Pollution"", whose rippling synths and haunting Julee Cruise-like vocals-- presumably provided by Halo-- make it a kind of otherworldly pop song. It's as if these sonic sculptors spent the previous five tracks chiseling away at a big block of sound until it produced this shiny little gem. It's remarkable enough that this one-time alliance produced so much good improvised music, an approach so dependent on listening and communication that it can take years of trial and error to create the right working situation. But the fact that they also made that music build to an album-ending peak gives <i>Vol. 7 </i>a shot at being a record that holds up over time, regardless of how impermanent this group itself may be.</p></div>"|15654.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15654-frkwys-vol-7/|7.7|Marc Masters

The music they're making is beguilingly strange, and although much of it carries bits and pieces of J Dilla's legacy, most sounds far removed from his dusty knock. Dilla set a precedent for the producer-as-auteur movement, but his influence is less apparent in the twisted synths and borrowed trance figures of this year's most interesting beatmakers.</p>
<p>Of course, there are still plenty of people carrying Jay Dee's torch in 2011: a good deal of the soul stable in Stones Throw, for example (J-Rocc, Oh No, Dilla's spiritual cousin and fellow innovator Madlib), as well as California's Sam Baker, aka <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/samiyambeats"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Samiyam</a>. His second long-player, <i>Sam Baker's Album</i>, is being released by Brainfeeder, Flying Lotus' label-- another artist whose early work was heavily indebted to Dilla (though creatively, he's in a much different place now). Compared to the futurist glitch work that's been released on Brainfeeder as of late, <i>Sam Baker's Album</i> sounds quite formalist in execution, right down to the last delayed beat-drop.</p>
<p>Still, this isn't exactly a ""real instrumental hip-hop, naw'mean"" traditionalism. Tart, whinnying keyboards abound, as well as a fair share of oozing bloops. But there's an enticing familiarity to what Samiyam is doing here, even if its own tiny eccentricities and abstractions take a few listens to wholly unpack. The stoner-giggle vocal samples scattered throughout only accentuate the record's sticky, loping feel; needless to say, there's a certain smoky atmosphere this music was almost tailor-made for. When he leaves the arena of sampled hip-hop signifiers and heads toward more abstract pastures, however, the material loses itself in its own towel-under-the-door haze.</p>
<p>Baker's early EPs (especially his 2008 <i>Return</i> EP for Hyperdub) were smothered with melodic wooze, which made the relatively straightforward boom-bap snippets on that same year's <i>Rap Beats, Vol. 1</i> LP seem a little rote and old-head by comparison. <i>Sam Baker's Album</i> continues on the latter path, but with a little more attention paid to the use of empty space. In other words, it's ""Sam Baker's album"" by name and ownership, but it's also another beat tape in a very crowded field, one where it's easy to get lost amidst the increasingly innovative producers working now.</p></div>"|15655.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15655-sam-bakers-album/|6.3|Larry Fitzmaurice

It's <span>a neatly evocative trick, but one that gloomy post-punk icons like X, the Mekons, and the Birthday Party already pulled off</span> in the late 1970s and early 80s. Another quarter-century removed from greasers, torch singers, and murder balladeers, Sons and Daughters' resurrections had a tendency to feel like kitsch, but really fun kitsch. Their antiquated influences eliminated the need for reverence, so the band could concentrate on cranking out absurdly enjoyable slices of breakneck nastiness.</p>
<p>Sons and Daughters' third full-length, <i>Mirror Mirror</i>, mostly trades one brand of pillaging for a duller one. The moroseness and death obsession remain (one song's about the Black Dahlia), but instead of using dark concerns as a springboard for sick thrills, Sons and Daughters have gotten hung up on the precise craft of emulating gothic post-punks like Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, and Bauhaus. <i>Mirror Mirror</i> is impressively spot-on in its reenactments, from doomy synths and cavernous drums to guitars that are practically always whirring, grinding, or shooting out lonely shards and tendrils; in fact, much of the album's merit is textural. But that's a dispiriting realization considering how great Sons and Daughters have previously been at crafting arresting, immediate hooks. And what happened to the tempos? Even the band's most ardent supporters would concede their previous albums were a tad relentless in their barreling pace, but too much of <i>Mirror Mirror</i> is either plodding or static. Only a few times, most notably on ""Breaking Fun"" and ""Rose Red"", do Sons and Daughters really get pulses pounding.</p>
<p>All this atmosphere and portent would be fine if the band displayed the presence to sell it. Instead, engrossing lead singer Adele Bethel cedes too much of the mic to counterpart Scott Paterson, who has been effective in call-and-response settings but isn't distinctive enough to carry songs himself. No matter who's taking the lead, neither singer seems to be having much fun, which used to be a constant for Sons and Daughters regardless of how bleak or blood-soaked their lyrical fixations might have been. <i>Mirror Mirror</i> smacks of a band struggling to be taken more seriously, but simply settling on a more stone-faced form of pastiche isn't the way to do it. All they've really done is trade a Halloween party for a history lesson.</p></div>"|15652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15652-mirror-mirror/|5.6|Joshua Love

The Chicago retro-rap duo seemed like they sprang fully formed from the Internet. They lived their lives one blog-bait mp3 at a time, releasing another dose of icy-cool 808 thud whenever the time felt right. For this group, the idea of an actual full-length album was almost beside the point. If they could tour-- and play lucrative corporate-sponsored shows-- without the benefit of an album, then why bother? It wasn't like the Cool Kids were bursting with artistic ambition; they rapped about their sneakers and cars and haircuts, not exactly the sort of thing that extends well over an hour or so. And though they've been promising the imminent arrival of honest-to-god debut album <i>When Fish Ride Bicycles</i> for a few years now, the release remained stuck between record labels, and it felt perfectly reasonable to assume that it would never show up.</p>
<p>The album has now shown up, but it's not some sweeping cohesive statement. <i>Fish</i> has a few big names attached, but it's not an onslaught of guests. If you've been paying attention to these guys over the past few years, almost everything here will sound familiar. The production, mostly from Cool Kid Chuck Inglish, is straightforwardly spacey, a crisp and bright take on minimal mid-1980s drum-machine boom. Inglish and Mikey Rocks have voices so flat that they usually sound bored, and they're less interested in punchlines than they are in matter-of-fact situational boasts, many of which have a weird patina of nostalgia to them.</p>
<p><i>When Fish Ride Bicycles</i> is out on Mountain Dew's <a href=""http://www.greenlabelsound.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Green Label Sound</a> imprint, but it's not like the Cool Kids are rapping about sipping on Code Red or anything. Instead, the album illustrates the absurd things a rap group has to do to release an actual wide-circulation retail album in 2011. They've made the leap to corporate patronage with their personalities totally unchanged; the move hasn't audibly affected their personality as a group. (It does have to be said, however, that the gigantic Mountain Dew logo on their cover art is a pretty bad look.)</p>
<p>The real move that the group makes on <i>When Fish Ride Bicycles</i> is a slight step away from minimal 80s rap toward squelchy 1980s funk. Most of the tracks here come with gooey Zapp-sounding keyboards, a slick melodic sound that gives their tracks an extra dimension. It's a sound that works for them in small doses, but when they go back to it a bit too often, the trick robs their simple, affectless sound of some of its power. Melody and warmth aren't Chuck Inglish's strong suits; he sounds best when he's stripped his tracks back to their barest elements, as he did on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11518-the-bake-sale-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Bake Sal</i>e</a> EP.</p>
<p>But these flourishes are nowhere near enough to drown the album. The Cool Kids' greatest asset is that their music is fun; it sounds good at parties, or on summer-afternoon drives, or at corporate-sponsored live shows. That doesn't change with <i>When Fish Ride Bicycles</i>. These guys still know who they are, and their lines still show some serious linguistic style without going out of their way to impress: ""She wanted me to beg, but I beg your pardon/ I'm Park Place, you're Marvin Gardens"". For a couple of tracks, they link up with the Neptunes, the producers whose dizzy Triton experiments probably showed them what a resourceful mind can do with a drum machine. Ghostface Killah and Bun B roll through, sounding grizzled and authoritative, their mere presence implying a sort of legitimacy. Asher Roth pops up on the unnecessary posse cut ""Roll Call"", but he gets out of the way without doing any serious damage. The whole thing makes for a solid, low-impact listen. It's not going to change your life or even, most likely, your day. But it might make 39 minutes pass by more quickly, and that's all it seems to want to do. The Cool Kids have now proven that they <i>can</i> make an album, but they haven't proven that they ever <i>needed</i> to make an album.</p></div>"|15628.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15628-when-fish-ride-bicycles/|6.9|Tom Breihan

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Austrian avant-guitarist and corrupted software whiz trafficked in the harsh and unpredictable ""glitch"" sound of his benefactors at the Mego label. But as he began to play openly with the surf's-up sound of 60s pop on 2001's <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3035-endless-summer/"" target=""_blank""><i>Endless Summer</i></a>, listeners not usually into grating improvised noise began to find a way into Fennesz's world. He became one of the 21st century's more improbable crossover figures, and one of its most inventive advocates for bringing the guitar into a brave new laptop world.</p>
<p>Fennesz's music hasn't shied away from darker places since, but his love of twisted beauty allows people a chance to become familiar with, even soothed by, a sound that seems decidedly not-for-everyone on the surface.  A four-track EP, <i>Seven Stars</i> is Fennesz in an almost purely placid mode, not too dissimilar to what he was exploring a decade ago. The least comfortable moments here, like ""July"", aren't all that different from the dark ambient the Aphex Twin was exploring circa <i>SAW II</i>. Even the metallic buzz that rises like the sound of insects on a summer night stays on just the right side of being shrill. Tracks like ""July"" and the cinematic ""Shift"" are about as uncomfortable as music can get while remaining immersive rather than alienating.</p>
<p>The last few years have seen a glut of day-at-the-beach acts using digital tools to capture a sense of summertime fun. Aside from the fact that he arguably got there first with <i>Endless Summer</i>, Fennesz's music is never quite so glib or obvious, attempting to capture the vibe of bands like the Beach Boys without the aid of quotes, hooks, harmonies, or even the stable ground of pop song structure. On ""Liminal"" and the title track, he evokes the heartsick string arrangements of the <i>Pet Sounds</i> era with unnatural swells of computerized sound that nonetheless have a real low-key emotional punch. And while his guitar is both bright and sad, a pure 60s balladeer tone, his playing still follows an improviser's inscrutable logic. <i>Seven Stars</i> is a welcome if not surprising dose of what Fennesz has been doing well for a decade now, playing on the thin edge between familiar pleasures and the truly out-there.</p></div>"|15650.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15650-seven-stars/|7.1|Jess Harvell

A Berlin producer with a penchant for French-sounding electro-house, he infrequently performs live, even though his <a href=""http://youtu.be/zsRs3WzsARA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">slick touch on the keyboard</a> is a big part of his appeal. Ambivalent about scenes, he released singles on many different imprints before finally showing, on 2011's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15214-mosaik/"">Mosaik</a></i>, that he could work beautifully on a larger canvas.</p>
<p>Issued by similarly genre-averse dance duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2978-modeselektor/"">Modeselektor</a> on their Monkeytown label, this career-spanning 2xCD compilation finds Siriusmo cleaning out his closet. It turns out that the ratio of pearls to embarrassments is impressively favorable. Many of these 42 tracks are available in digital form for the first time, and eight of them, such as the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4529-vitalic/"">Vitalic</a>-style grinder ""Hello DJ"", are previously unreleased. Covering the first decade of the 2000s, the set bears ample French-touch traces, often evoking a more musical <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2851-mr-oizo/"">Mr. Oizo</a>, an earthier <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a>, or a much airier <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2223-justice/"" target=""_blank"">Justice</a>. Siriusmo's remixes and compilation appearances for Ed Banger and Kitsuné Maison make this Parisian connection as close as he comes to a scene affiliation.</p>
<p>Still, the hot-blooded, jammy aesthetic here is more like a bundle of personal predilections than a membership application. Siriusmo loves to set scampering funk, meaty saw-wave synths, and hammy vocal samples against percussion so crisply pounding it edges into rock territory. Clean-cut verses and choruses, connected by extended, unlooped instrumental solos, enhance the live feel-- the electric guitar on ""Last Dear"", for instance. Some of the sample choices loaded into Siriusmo's Korg Trident lean toward pop, such as a brief <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ji2ma2mfyhU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stevie Wonder/Jackson 5</a> horn flourish on ""All the Girls"". Others are more obscure: Early electronic pop pioneers <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perrey_and_Kingsley"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Perrey-Kingsley</a> supply the protoplasm for ""Blaue Sonne"".</p>
<p>At nearly two-and-a-half hours, <i>Pearls &amp; Embarrassments</i> is a lot to take in, and the reliability of Siriusmo's craft causes the songs to run together after a while. But that's just the nature of this sort of housecleaning. You really can dip into the compilation at any point and find something appealing. Siriusmo works in essentials: Key in on the effective groove and the stirring harmonic idea, and jettison the rest. In a way, he's a throwback to a time before limitless soft synths gave producers limitless choices. ""Sometimes,"" he <a href=""http://nashvillenightsblog.com/interview-siriusmo/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told one interviewer</a>, ""it's good just to have your one synthesizer or one piano and your drum and you can play like you're in a little band.""</p></div>"|15648.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15648-pearls-embarrassments-2000-2010/|7.4|Brian Howe

The London trio has been stepping out, remixing others and working on collaborations. During an appearance at the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M2FSfNVR8U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Independent Label Market</a> in London a couple of months ago, Lewis Rainsbury cut a slight, red-haired figure, complete with a ""Vondelpark"" badge for identification.</p>
<p>Capitalization quirks aside, <i>nyc stuff and nyc bags</i> is mostly a clearer vision, too. <i>Sauna</i>'s smeared sonics have given way to something more refined. On ""TV"", Vondelpark even pushes the vocal more to the center, though it's still bathed in warmly romantic production. With synth strings and a vocal that has a bit of R&amp;B drama, ""Camels"" is similarly sensual, as guitar chords stab at the fringes of languid bass and a clipped garage sample. Vondelpark's production still feels happily self-contained, but the smaller details-- thin bongo rhythms, a jagged sample hit in the right channel-- help make for a more focused track.</p>
<p>Where <i>Sauna</i> put elements of UK garage and bass music in a bedroom setting, <i>nyc stuff and nyc bags</i> is a more confident, summer-drenched listen. Take ""Feat B"", for instance: a Balearic-leaning cut complete with dubby horns, bongos, and a blissed-out female vocal. Anyone missing Air France could do worse than find comfort food here. While this second effort shows no great leap forward in terms of quality, it only underscores that Vondelpark are one of the more interesting UK production groups to emerge lately, mysterious or not.</p></div>"|15640.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15640-nyc-stuff-and-nyc-bags/|7.5|Hari Ashurst

Things didn't quite go according to plan. On her arrival in the country, Wyatt discovered the Ethiopian government had <a href=""http://hopscotchrecords.com/film/1000stars/1000STARS.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">canceled the event</a>. So Wyatt instead headed out to visit 13 tribes, whose performances <i>Staring Into the Sun</i> documents in a DVD, a CD, notes, and photographs. It's an extraordinarily careful, comprehensive package, featuring stories about close calls with authorities, comments on the distinctive qualities of each tribe, and details about the various instruments used in the recordings.</p>
<p>The hour-long DVD is the best way most of us will have to witness the music of the people Wyatt visited. With visuals as hypnotic as the performances, she deftly illustrates how music seeps into many different parts of life. The opening scene is one of the most spectacular, showing members of the Borana tribe in southern Ethiopia chanting a cyclical polyphonic song as they pass up buckets of water from a multi-level well; Wyatt's shots skillfully match the repetitive nature of this backbreaking work. Scenes of spiritual possession and ceremonial whipping further demonstrate music's role in ritual practices. The sheer breadth of styles in the film also extends to more commercial fare-- often featuring keyboards and synthesized drums-- shot directly from TV sets. One clip even features a band decked out in military garb and posing with guns. That stands in stark contrast to the the scenes of the Tsemay tribe, where kids and adults bounce around in a circle to an uplifting song. The big highlight here is the discordant synchronized panpipe playing of the Dirashe tribe in the Great Rift Valley; the music feels like it could career out of control at any moment, but it never does.</p>
<p>The accompanying CD is less essential than the film, though it just about works as a standalone item. Listing no artists or tracks, the disc is simply a collection of recordings Wyatt made. Some of them feature the trilling female vocals that are a staple of the region; others are built around an open-ended structure of loosely handclapped rhythms. The masterfully off-kilter panpipe players of the Dirashe tribe resurface in a nearly eight-minute excerpt of a piece that presumably stretched on far longer. The disc's common thread comes through its ceaselessly looping vocal chants, which are mesmerizingly easy to get lost in-- just as the performers themselves may have done to reach such a trance-inducing state. <i>Staring Into the Sun</i> shows how that kind of loosening is simply one of many purposes music can have for a group of people.</p></div>"|15636.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15636-staring-into-the-sun/|7.2|Nick Neyland

For one, this Brooklyn quartet's name is pretty much identical to that of fellow New Yorker JD Samson's active post-Le Tigre project, <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/men"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MEN</a>. Their 2010 sophomore release, <i>Immaculada</i>, featured a caterwauling noise-punk thrasher called ""Oh Yoko"" that had absolutely nothing to do with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxk0vsONJO0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the classic John Lennon song</a>, or Ms. Ono herself, for that matter. Their new album swipes its title from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_Home"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a legendary record</a> by New York's most famous punk band, the Ramones. And part way through the obliquely titled mid-album track ""( )"", when the band realize they're ripping off the fuzz-bomb riff to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg5D-CqDoI8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spacemen 3's ""Revolution""</a>, they just go ahead and swipe a line from the song too, and cap it with another quote from Spacemen's ""Take Me to the Other Side"" for good measure. And yet: For all the cheeky references and inside jokes at play on the Men's <i>Leave Home</i>, you'd be hard-pressed to find a purer, no-bullshit, serious-as-a-heart-attack rock record released this year.</p>
<p>Listening to <i>Leave Home</i> feels a lot like living inside of Michael Azerrad's 1980s indie-rock tome <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Band_Could_Be_Your_Life"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Our Band Could Be Your Life</a></i>, variously bringing to mind Sonic Youth and Dinosaur Jr.'s SST stints, Sub Pop-vintage Mudhoney, and Touch and Go-era Butthole Surfers (who surely would approve of a song title like ""Shittin' With the Shah""). Tellingly, Azerrad's book ties up its narratives the moment its subjects signed to majors-- partly because, technically speaking, they ceased to be indie rock at that point but, more importantly, because those artists produced their most enduring, groundbreaking music while recording for independent labels. <i>Leave Home</i> is likewise a frozen tableau of that tipping point, imagining a parallel universe in which your favorite first-wave indie-rock bands never had to sign on corporate letterhead, never got anywhere near MTV, never toned down their act, and never got old-- they just kept on blowing minds at the peak of their powers in perpetuity.</p>
<p>Where the discographies of those aforementioned influences can more or less be plotted on a straight line from chaos to control, the Men's modest catalogue thus far presents no such linear evolutionary trajectory. <i>Immaculada</i> may have introduced folky acoustic guitar passages and extended doom-metal instrumentals to their post-hardcore attack, but rather than continue to explore those stylistic detours, <i>Leave Home</i> sees the Men return to the full-torque distorto-rock of their 2009 debut EP, but blow it up on a grander scale with a more intense batch of songs. And rather than try to upgrade the fidelity to accommodate the more epic execution, the unapologetic corrosiveness of the sound is ultimately what gives it its power and heft.</p>
<p>So that means <i>Leave Home</i>'s boldest gesture-- the seven-minute opener ""If You Leave...""-- is also its least typical, not just for its tsunami-sized shoegaze haze, but for its open-hearted candor, as its lone, repeated lyric (""I would die"") provides a surprisingly affecting answer to the title's open-ended suggestion. The song is every bit as surprising coming from these guys as the similarly miasmic ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeSwal4jqyk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Farewell</a>"" was on Boris' 2006 album <i>Pink</i>, showcasing the respective bands' abilities to be as blissful as they are bludgeoning. But where ""Farewell"" anticipated the Japanese doom demigods' eventual drift toward melodic accessibility, ""If You Leave..."" is a calm-before-the-storm misdirection. By the time <i>Leave Home</i>'s side one winds down with the grueling, hoarse-throat howls and torturous, slow-motion squall of ""L.A.D.O.C.H."", you'll be wondering if you're still listening to the same band.</p>
<p>But on <i>Leave Home</i>'s second half, the Men's dual affinities for brute punk-rock force and bad-trip psychedelia fuse together to brilliant effect, with a searing series of songs that refuse to relent even as they encroach on the five-minute mark-- in particular, the storming ""Bataille"" suggests Sonic Youth's ""Hey Joni"" as recorded by <i>Funhouse</i>-era Stooges, while the closing ""Night Landing"" effectively blurs the line between krautrock and punk in fine <i>Neu! '75</i>-style. Of course, with a name like the Men-- and reference points like these-- it's all too fitting that this album will undoubtedly appeal to a certain subset of record-collecting dudes. But the Men's treatment of their well-curated influences is less akin to that of fan-boys playing in a tribute act and a lot more like an irreverent hip-hop producer's approach to breaks-- key in on your sources' coolest moments, change the context, and ride that perfect sound forever. <!--EndFragment--></p></div>"|15629.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15629-leave-home/|8.2|Stuart Berman

This dorm-room theorizing also shows up in selected song titles: ""Trancegender"", ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15928-post-physical/"" target=""_blank"">Post Physical</a>"", ""Body Mod"".</p>
<p>Listeners who approach <i>Thee Physical</i> probably aren't showing up for Egedy's flimsy personal-political philosophizing, though. They're here for his frayed, ear-bleeding take on 1990s diva-house and electro-- disembodied leather hands be damned. Pictureplane's 2009 label debut, <i>Dark Rift</i>, was a statement of purpose, packed with both thrilling moments (""Goth Star"") and drifting provocation (nine-minute closer ""True Ruin""). On <i>Thee Physical</i>, the approach is considerably more refined, with HEALTH's Jupiter Keyes helping lend a new, immediate sonic appeal. Keyes knows a thing or two about tempering industrial-tinged aggression with sugared sensuality (see last year's HEALTH single ""USA Girls""), and on <i>Thee Physical</i> that balance is more present than it's ever been in his main gig.</p>
<p>Further contributing to the album's accessibility is Egedy's move from staticky speaker-pounders toward honest-to-god pop songs. Early album offerings ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15834-real-is-a-feeling/"" target=""_blank"">Real Is a Feeling</a>"" and ""Post Physical"" ably showcase his steps toward electro approachability; other songs feature Egedy engaging as an in-the-flesh sideman to the snippets of throaty vocal samples strewn throughout. This man-machine relationship was prominent on <i>Dark Rift</i>, too; <i>Thee Physical</i> does it better. What's more, Egedy's inherently thin voice sounds stronger in its surroundings here.</p>
<p>And yet, for all the improvements, there are times when Egedy's handmade beats seem slightly out of rhythm with everything else that's going on around them (an issue that's especially apparent on ""Black Nails""). And when the album's most vibrant hook shows up, on ""Trancegender"", it's quickly buried in favor of the murky atmospherics that jam up the album's second half. <i>Thee Physical</i> wants to mosh in the punk club as much as it wants to throw on some lip gloss and hit the town, and it's frustratingly enticing to imagine how the record would have turned out if Egedy had leaned on the gas towards the latter option.</p></div>"|15635.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15635-thee-physical/|7.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

<p>Ferraro's music can be as confusing as that rambling proclamation. Yet there's a weird, hermetic kind of logic to both. Whatever a ""life temple"" might be, you can imagine it when you hear his mysterious, hyper-referential sound. He relies on samples, loops, and the textures and aura of 80s pop-- the kind heard on worn-out VHS tapes and glitchy video games.

<p>Often, this approach can produce remarkably catchy music. <i>Night Dolls with Hairspray</i> in particular is filled with hooky gems.

Some might even find its sheen nauseating, much the way audiences left <i>The Blair Witch Project </i>more sick from the shaky camerawork than scared by the plot.

<p>Just don't wait around for him to tone it down.

That's the mode that Ferraro is in on <i>On Air</i>, first issued as a limited CD-R on Olde English Spelling Bee and recently pressed onto vinyl by Underwater Peoples. Here, he seems to man a black-hole radio station, mixing in surreal announcements and static-laden transitions. Snippets of melody and blasts of noise slam into each other, with single tracks often containing four or five chunks of what could be songs on their own. Maybe Ferraro's own trippy titles explain it best: ""Electrocuted Hair"", ""New Waver From Hawaii Saturn"", ""Virtual Sumo Bubble Gum"", ""Cyber Shock Headtroplolis"".

He rapped so fast that you actually needed the lyric sheet he'd helpfully include in his albums, and those lyrics would be so dense and jangled that you'd also need the little mini-essays he'd pen about each song and its inspirations. Self-seriousness was his thing, and it could sometimes be a weakness; it's a big part of the reason he came out on the losing end of a terrifically entertaining beef with El-P (El: ""I feel like Selena, the president of my fan club trying to kill me""). But that intensity also turned him into a compelling figure. ""The white man's the fucking devil,"" he almost-famously roared in 2003. And yes, he's white. Obviously.</p>
<p>But the twisty, blown-out form of indie rap that helped birth Sole (and El-P, and everyone else in that scene at that time) has largely disappeared from the map, sending an entire generation of underground rappers scrambling to figure out ways to remain relevant. On his new <i>Hello Cruel World</i>, Sole tries harder than most. As he has on most of his recent releases, Sole teams up with Arizona's multi-instrumentalist trio the Skyrider Band. But together, they chase a different sound this time out: the sort of diffuse synthetic soul that's slowly taking over the rap mainstream. The beats on <i>Hello Cruel World</i> are full of simple, understated new-wave melodies and empty space. Sole has largely curbed his frantic, out-of-control, sometimes-arrhythmic rap style, going for a measured and controlled thing instead. There are song where Sole <i>sings</i>. There are songs were Sole sings <i>through Auto-Tune</i>. At times, he sounds like a dreadlocked, anarchist-bookstore version of Drake. It's a truly odd album-- and in its own way, it's a brave one.</p>
<p>""Bad Captain Swag"" is the best song here, and the one that best encapsulates the sound Sole chases all throughout the album. I'm not even really sure what ""Bad Captain Swag"" is about-- credit card debt or something. But with its truly unexpected Lil B guest verse, the song works as a summit meeting between two very different generations of indie rap, and it shows that the two rappers may have as much uniting them as they do separating them. These are two messy artists, and both verses have their goofy moments. The Based God is in his spaced-out, the-world-is-crazy mode. Sole, meanwhile, offers up this as a boast: ""You don't wanna battle me; you're better off enlisting in the upcoming war against China."" (He also becomes maybe the first rapper to ever use the word ""stagflation"" in a rhyme.) And yet there's a sort of outsider-art chemistry at work here, with the weirdly catchy zoned-out synth track and the airily crooned hook from Denver electro-noise producer Pictureplane. It's nuts-- and not in a bad way-- that Sole and Soulja Boy are now just one degree removed from each other.</p>
<p>Nothing else on the album touches that track, but it's intriguing to hear Sole push his old style in different directions. <i>Hello Cruel World</i> is an album that flirts with accessibility, but you're not exactly going to crash radio playlists with lines like this bit of anti-Red Cross invective, from ""We Will Not Be Moved"": ""Want me to donate? We gave helicopters to Israel, free health care to the Middle East. Now who's gonna fix my teeth?"" And things get downright silly when he leaves behind politics entirely and indulges in dorm-room philosophizing: ""Someday I'll leave this place, be it by bullet or by rocket/ And they can use my corpse to fertilize another planet"" (from the title track). But nobody's ever going to this guy for clear, concrete ideas; abstract obfuscation is what he does. On <i>Hello Cruel World</i>, he finds some new ways to do it. They don't work out as often as we might hope, but at least he's trying.</p></div>"|15647.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15647-hello-cruel-world/|6.1|Tom Breihan

The liner notes indicate the Chicago art-rockers recorded <i>Mindreading</i> in April 2009, with mixing later that year by Randall Dunn-- a producer for heavy-music heavyweights <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"">Earth</a>. Meanwhile, with former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4431-us-maple/"">U.S. Maple</a> guitarist Todd Rittman leaving to focus on his <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Dead+Rider"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dead Rider</a> project, Singer have slimmed down to a three-piece: ex-U.S. Maple drummer Adam Vida; his brother, Ben; and former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3044-90-day-men/"">90 Day Men</a> bassist Robert A.A. Lowe (who also records solo as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2610-lichens/"">Lichens</a>). Beyond that, their new album's as mysterious as Lowe's brief collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"">TV on the Radio</a>.</p>
<p>The air of inscrutability surrounding this band helps align <i>Mindreading</i> with some pre-internet Drag City releases. It's reminiscent of something you'd stumble across in the racks of a record store and take a chance on, perhaps because of the label or a familiar name credited on the back sleeve. Even the enigmatic covert art might be enough. The musical offerings inside continue that theme; it's never really clear who's singing, what the words are, or which instruments were used. The sighing falsettos that rise and fall against stuttery percussion and chunky analog keyboard runs on opener ""Sister's Mane"" will be familiar to anyone who remembers <i>Unhistories</i>, but there the similarities mostly end. Guitars are on the backburner for much of this recording, with condensed synth tones pushed firmly to the fore.</p>
<p>""Voices from the Tapes"" flicks back and forth between a serene central groove and great piles of ugly electronics. On the following ""Wi(s)tches"", the group's vocals battle with analog sounds that reach a piercing screech as the song dawdles to a close. There are germs of good ideas here: For instance, the woozy, multi-layered singing in ""Dial ""M"" for Mother"" edges close to the kind of work Doseone occasionally hits on in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4094-subtle/"">Subtle</a>. Too often, though, Singer are on a journey with no particular destination in mind, especially when they lurch from the ugly liquid funk of ""Gabbing"" into the unfocused crooning of closer ""Bitter'd Moon"". It's a shame, because the track records of everyone involved suggest <i>Mindreading</i> could have been a different proposition. Instead it's all untethered strands of work loosely floating around, with occasional moments of clarity that might make this a record worth returning to when another three years have passed.</p></div>"|15631.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15631-mindreading/|5.8|Nick Neyland

Spend 15 minutes trying to sort out how much he's made in the past four <i>months</i> and you'll feel in your stomach just how deep the Internet goes. More than any other musician, the Bay Area rapper has adapted his creative behavior to resemble the rippling action of your RSS feed-- an unceasing, pellet-dispenser flow of new content.</p>
<p>It's a self-contained musical universe, located at the vanishing point on the ""all-or-nothing"" spectrum, and its cult of faithful has been steadily building to the point where the mainstream rap industry has been forced to contend with him. The result was a hip-hop comedy of manners: as <i>XXL</i> included him on their Freshmen 2011 list alongside industry non-entities like Mac Miller and Lil Twist and Lupe Fiasco <a href=""http://www.lupefiasco.com/news/5b68ed-why-i-like-lil-b-a-review/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">publicly congratulated himself</a> for ""getting it,"" B basically continued whistling his tune, collaborating with Lil Wayne and Jean Grae and Tony Yayo and rapping over How to Dress Well instrumentals. And then he announced at Coachella he was going to name his next album <i>I'm Gay</i>.</p>
<p>With this single statement, Lil B calmly detonated a flower-power land mine in the center of what is arguably rap's most tortured, combustible political arena. Whatever his motivations (it probably had something to do with his philosophy of universal acceptance and self-love, but his manifestos don't survive close analysis), he guaranteed that the album's audience would be exponentially larger than anything he'd done before.</p>
<p><i>I'm Gay</i> appeared on iTunes last week, and by convenience or design, it's his most coherent, cohesive, and accessible single release to date. His followers may debate whether <i>Rain in England</i> or <i>6 Kiss</i> or <i>Illusions of Grandeur</i> or <i>Bitch Mob: Respect Da Bitch</i> is better (Lil B has a flair for titles), but for the uninitiated, <i>I'm Gay</i> does a great job of articulating his ethos and appeal in the space of one album. If you're intrigued by Lil B but shrink from the commitment of keeping pace with a human data stream, it might be the only record you'll ever need.</p>
<p>That's not to say that <i>I'm Gay</i> contains all of Lil B's personae. The album finds him securely in his dazed, child-like observer mode, where he peers at the world as if for the first time and wonders aloud. He has many other faces-- <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLKuoklj1bo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">occasional boom-bap traditionalist</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m5CIcbytfM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tweaker of boom-bap traditionalism</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-IYSl4I-4I&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">uncomfortably personal YouTube diarist</a>--  but this side is easily B's most relatable and endearing. The production, by frequent collaborators Clams Casino, 9th Wonder, and others, reinforces the mood of naive reverie: ""Gon Be Okay"" samples an orchestral flourish from the soundtrack to Hayao Miyazaki's <i>Spirited Away</i>, while ""Unchain Me"" is built on a loop of ""Cry Little Sister"" from <i>The Lost Boys</i> soundtrack. ""I Hate Myself"" is a woozy, pitched-down loop of Goo Goo Doll's ""Iris"" in which the drums hit like down pillows. You're unlikely to find a more guileless or gentle hip-hop record this year.</p>
<p>Lil B's stream-of-consciousness lyrical approach remains uniquely suited to this sort of cosmic contemplation.  Composing your thoughts on the fly has obvious downsides, and Lil B's YouTube channel is littered with examples of times he hit ""record"" and the muse failed to follow. But here, he's consistently focused and has a knack for articulating universal sentiments in seemingly artless wording: I can't think of anyone else who could say things like, ""The people die for a piece of paper, it's so stupid"" or ""If God's real, then why'd my friend have to die?"" or ""Don't wanna go to school because the teacher's too simple/ I just wanna know where I come from, just tell me,"" and prompt contemplation instead of laughs.</p>
<p>But then, reproducing lines like these in print doesn't do them justice. Lil B's music draws on spontaneity as its wellspring; you hear him stumble, pause for breath, abandon a line of thought and start over. So when he happens across a searing image like ""Mental slavery/ Niggas hangin off trees in the woods,"" and roams his way to ""I'm nicer than Grandma with a cup of iced tea"" a few lines later, there's a charge of discovery in the air-- the conviction that you're hearing music and expression being born raw.</p>
<p>""I'm ready to give up/My old thoughts...Everything I seen was a lie/I'm not ready to die/I love myself"" he declares on ""I Hate Myself,"" a vague but powerful manifesto that suggests why Lil B has inspired such fervent devotion. He projects fearlessness, which can take many forms: it can mean deciding to name your rap album ""I'm Gay"" out of thin air. (The subtitled ""I'm Happy"" was a deflating backward step, it's true, but it was hard to get riled considering how little motivation he had to choose the name <i>I</i>'<i>m Gay</i> in the first place). It can also mean <a href=""http://twitter.com/#%21/LILBTHEBASEDGOD/status/86626774393430018"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">posting the album for free</a> to your quarter-million Twitter followers hours after it was made available for purchase. It can mean sharing every half-baked scrap and warty throwaway you record, trusting your fans to decide what's worth keeping.

At the time, the general public was just beginning to understand what AIDS actually was and how it could be transmitted. Red Hot's decision to raise money for AIDS research by selling themed albums featuring prominent musicians helped raise awareness as well as funds, and its first compilation, 1990's <i>Red Hot + Blue</i>, featuring David Byrne and Tom Waits, among others, covering Cole Porter songs, sold more than a million copies and made millions of dollars for AIDS-focused non-profits.</p>
<p>Twenty-one years later, <i>Red Hot + Rio 2</i> is the 12th <i>Red Hot</i> title, and the organization has released nine other compilations (including <i>No Alternative</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12717-dark-was-the-night/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dark Was the Night</i></a>). The math is a little different these days. Not as many people buy CDs, and the idea of selling a million of these seems almost quaint (2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12717-dark-was-the-night/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dark Was the Night</i></a> still managed to raise more than a million dollars, though). AIDS awareness is also in a very different place-- in an odd way, people in the United States seem to have almost forgotten how bad the pandemic really is, and how crushing it is in a lot of societies, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. AIDS has become something that's just there, in the background, and we may know a few people who have it, but the aura of public health crisis has fallen away from it in our media. So in that way, building awareness is just as important as ever.</p>
<p><i>Red Hot + Rio 2</i> is a follow-up to the 1996 <i>Red Hot + Rio</i> installment, which was focused on an update of 60s bossa nova sounds. This moves on to a contemporary take on Tropicália, and the list of collaborators involved includes a few original Tropicálistas: Rita Lee (solo), Os Mutantes (with of Montreal), Tom Zé (with Javelin), and Caetano Veloso (solo and with David Byrne). It also features Beck and Brazilian singer Seu Jorge doing a version of the former's own ""Tropicália"", and a mix of other artists doing covers of original Tropicália songs and new tunes written in descended styles. These artists, working alone and together in various combinations, come from at least four continents, and you'll hear Brazilians singing in English, Americans singing in Portuguese, and all sorts of other oddities. Sonically, this is aimed in a strange place, somewhere near the middle of the road, but not quite there-- it edges into too-smooth territory on the John Legend and Twin Danger tracks, but also into funky surrealism on the Os Mutantes/Of Montreal update of ""Bat Macumba"" and into heady jazz on Madlib's collaboration with veteran Brazilian singer Joyce Moreno.</p>
<p>Some of the best tracks either feature Tropicálistas or their songs. Gilberto Gil's classic ""Aquele Abraço"" gets a propulsive, percussion-heavy funk reworking courtesy of Forró in the Dark, Brazilian Girls and Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo. David Byrne and Caetano Veloso sound great dueting on ""Dreamworld/Marco De Canaveses"", backed by spooky synths and strings. Veloso's simple ""Terra"" also sounds good getting picked apart by Prefuse 73 and remade as it plays from a spare acoustic song into a gently dissonant orchestral work.</p>
<p>In 2011, the mainstream benefit LP no doubt plays a delicate balancing act, trying to be interesting enough musically to connect with adventurous listeners, but broadly appealing enough not to drive off more casual listeners who want to contribute to a good cause while buying one of the very few CDs they'll purchase all year. There's a sweet spot in between that <i>Red Hot + Rio 2</i> comes close to hitting over the course of its two discs. Some of it will be a little too out-there for some people, and some of it will be a little too harmless for others. But overall, it's an interesting assemblage of artists, and the music is good, covering just enough ground that you can feel the variety but no one's likely to be overwhelmed.</p></div>"|15642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15642-red-hot-rio-2/|7.2|Joe Tangari

The Baltimore-based noise-punk quartet embraces the signature sounds of the alternative nation, but uses pedals, loops, and off-kilter rhythms to pummel its teenage heroes into blurry abstraction. Borrowing from punk-funk and nu-metal as much as spazz-core and pigfuck, the group plays Dr. Moreau with a decade's worth of MTV buzz clips. It's telling that Dope Body's debut album, <i>Nupping</i>, has a song called ""The Shape of Grunge to Come.""</p>
<p>Bro-rock and Boredoms mash up better than you might think. Live, Dope Body are a mosh-worthy mess of sweat and blast beats. Frontman Andrew Laumann alternates between punker grunts and animalistic yelps, his shirt rarely staying on his chest for an entire performance, while guitarist Zach Utz makes hairpin turns between stoner chugging and modem noise. <i>Nupping</i> does an admirable job of capturing the band's spastic onstage energy.</p>
<p>Album opener ""Enemy Outta Me"" wiggles to life with the band playing around an off-time loop, but it quickly makes a left turn into scorching riff-rock. Utz pulls double duty, answering each of his chugging stoner riffs with a bevy of electronic gurgles. When it's time for the big guitar solo, he instead opts for some balloon-on-hair squelches. ""Bangers &amp; Yos"" pogos around on a rubber-band riff that's just far enough removed from ""Bulls on Parade"" that Rage's lawyers won't have grounds to sue.</p>
<p>Like Philly sludge-punkers Pissed Jeans, Dope Body have a special gift for draining the air from muscle-head music. Pissed Jeans do this mainly through lyrics, imbuing early 80s hardcore with a narrative of manly anguish. Dope Body pull at the sounds of dude-rock like taffy-- tugging guitars out of key, building up big walls of heavy rhythm only to belch in the face of fist-pumping catharsis. Utz's expansive pedal board and glitchy deconstruction of Tom Morello riffs may hint at arty pretensions, but Dope Body still smell punk.</p></div>"|15637.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15637-nupping/|7.8|Aaron Leitko

With no guest singers and zero hooks, Ratcliffe's new solo EP is another chance for these one-time house barbarians to remind people why their unconventional spirit once made dance classicists turn up their noses.</p>
<p><i>Dorus Rijkers</i> unleashes live-sounding rhythms that twist, turn, and feel like they don't want to do what their producer tells them to do. Opener ""Tightrope"" sounds like Ratcliffe tried to lay down a fat, funky, straightforward breakbeat, but then his cheekiness got the better of him, with the boom-bap quickly mutating into a loony jazz-metal hybrid. On much of the EP, the squealing synths and ultra-bright electro riffs aren't too far off from the kind of arcade-game mania and tortured g-funk beloved by Zomby, Rustie, and their peers. In fact, the frenetic, densely layered ""Mindset"" makes the post-dubstep crew sound almost staid, while its fried fuzz-bass and general noisy mayhem shame the Ed Banger crew and similarly brutal French house producers.</p>
<p>The second half of the EP is calmer, but just as surprising. ""Flying by the Sun"" essentially applies the methodology of disco edits to an old electric jazz record, compressing a half-hour of free-flowing improvisation into a deranged four-and-a-half-minute jukebox single. But even in shortened form, this kind of knotty jazz-funk isn't for everyone. Neither is <i>Dorus Rijkers</i> as a whole, even at just four tracks, which is probably the perfect length to avoid burning out on music this dense and convoluted. If you think that Basement Jaxx have been too buttoned up lately, then you'll probably appreciate the way <i>Dorus Rijkers</i> sounds like a man unleashing a lot of fuck-you intensity. Throw it on looking for the glossy roller-boogie bounce or Euro-pop sheen of <i>Crazy Itch Radio</i> or <i>Scars</i>, though, and the drums alone will slap the expectations right out of you.</p></div>"|15634.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15634-dorus-rijkers-ep/|7.0|Jess Harvell

So let's just get some painfully obvious housekeeping out of the way: Kamtin Mohager's glossy synth-pop project sounds absolutely nothing like a chain gang and even less like 1974. Instead, the album stresses familiarity, easy nostalgia, and an eagerness to please, laying down its dividing lines like the ""80s Night"" at your local undergrad bar: If you can somehow find novelty in that sort of thing in 2011, you'll have yourself a blast, whereas anyone who thinks the decade had more to offer than doing tequila shots to ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOg5VxrRTi0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hungry Like the Wolf</a>"" while <i>Pretty in Pink</i> plays in closed captioning are gonna feel like killjoys through no real fault of their own.</p>
<p>I'll give Mohager this: The dude knows how to write a hook. The arc of the melodies, the word choice, the decision of when to crank the reverb and when to lay off-- all are indicative of someone who's broken down the hits of his childhood into formulae, their moving parts charted and graphed. Nearly every track on <i>Wayward Fire</i> makes some sort of ascendant grab at a brass ring, and displaying a skill that's often underrated, Mohager can string together fairly basic rhymes in a way that gives just enough meaning. And he can lose himself in whatever guise is appropriate to get his point across. ""I get so high when the devil comes to take me/ I get so high when the devil is a lady,"" is delivered by an agitated disco infiltrator, while a New Romantic on the verge of emotional overload promises, ""I will run, I will fly, I will see you in a matter of time."" That sort of thing.</p>
<p>Problem is, there's a lot of <i>Wayward Fire</i> that takes place between those choruses. More to the point, there's a lot of <i>Wayward Fire</i> period: at nearly an hour long, it surpasses audacity into the realm of pure self-defeat. There are pleasures to be had here, but every single track could comfortably shave about a minute and a half and still deliver them. It's less of an issue when he's courting bedside melodrama as opposed to dancefloor seduction since Mohager sounds more comfortable navigating verse/chorus structure than a vamp. And when he tries dance music, his idle hands mostly get the better of him. <i>Wayward Fire</i> continually misses a sweet spot between being lean and dirty enough to aerodynamically groove and being maximalist to the point where it opts out of that mode completely. And as a result, there's always that one last addition to the mix that sticks in your craw.</p>
<p>I suppose that it's a sign of where we're at, that an LP so steeped in 80s signifiers feels so completely... normal. But while certainly dedicated to its source material, Mohager's lack of commitment to any sonic or lyrical identity unintentionally confirms the old stereotypes that kept this stuff out of indie rock in the first place-- that it can't be made personal and that its ultimate goal is to be fashionable and disposable. Though clearly precocious with melodies, Mohager never presents himself as more than collector, which is why <i>Wayward Fire</i> ends up less like a living celebration of the past and more like a display case of your favorite synth-pop action figures in their original packaging.</p></div>"|15644.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15644-wayward-fire/|5.7|Ian Cohen

It's a curious image, embedded with a Buffalo Bill pun, and it playfully nods to the band's refusal to practice expected music-industry behaviors like appearing prominently on their album covers, lip-syncing in videos, writing love songs, or generally revealing too much of themselves beyond the music. Even four albums into their career, they still cultivated an enigmatic presence on <i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i>, starting with that cover and extending to the dropped apostrophe in that title and the mismatched tracklists. Furthermore, the mysterious painted figures and roughly sketched symbols in the liner notes presented the album as something more akin to folk art than folk rock.</p>
<p>In direct conflict with that visual impression, <i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i> was R.E.M.'s most pop-oriented and accessible album up to that point. Recording frequently and touring almost constantly, the band had been nurturing a grassroots audience throughout the early 1980s, and <i>Pageant</i> is a pivotal album in their career, representing the moment when their Southern post-punk sound anticipated larger venues and began expanding to fill those spaces. It was also, strangely, their most overtly political collection, with songs addressing environmental crises and political malaise. Rather than sounding sanctimonious, however, such dissent energized R.E.M. and injected more pep into Berry's drumbeats, more incisive jangle into Peter Buck's guitar, and more charisma into Michael Stipe's performance. The album barrels along in just over 30 minutes, lending the songs a sense of purpose. This is music that has to be somewhere.</p>
<p><i>Lifes</i> is celebratory rather than commiserative, with tense tempos fueling heraldic choruses and shout-outs to Woody Guthrie (""Cuyahoga"") and Cole Porter (""Begin the Begin""). Stipe's lyrical dodginess, such a formidable weapon on previous albums, allows the band to come at these issues from obscure angles: With its rousing chorus and pensive bass line, ""Cuyahoga"" mails postcard dispatches from a museum where rivers and plains are artifacts, consigned to diorama and memory rather than reality. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf6vCjtaV1k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fall on Me</a>"" mixes spiritual and consumerist language to deliver a knotted ecological message that takes some unpacking: ""Buy the sky and sell the sky,"" Stipe sings, then changes the Wall Street phrasing: ""Lift your arms up to the sky. Ask the sky and ask the sky, don't fall on me.""</p>
<p>Maybe that's why the band chose to close with Mike Mills-sung cover of the Clique's ""Superman"". Seemingly out of place on such a serious-minded album and certainly jarring after the Civil War fever dream of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_QG6tr9mjo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Swan Swan H</a>"", it's been derided as R.E.M. at their most superfluous. But that's how they must have felt at the time-- like supermen taking on the world's problems and finding they had unknown powers. In that regard, they're aided significantly by producer Don Gehman, who was then famous for helming John Cougar's early albums. Who knew that Gehman would handle R.E.M. better than folk-rock legend Joe Boyd, who nearly made a muddle of their previous album, <i>Fables of the Reconstruction</i>? In addition to giving the melodic leads their own space, he emphasizes the muscle in Berry's beats and the intricate interaction between the rhythm section. No wonder the drummer's on the album cover: Berry's responsible for the furious pace of the album and enables its abrupt detours into salsa and <i>Nuggets</i> pop.</p>
<p>That dynamic makes the remaster on this 25th anniversary reissue sound even livelier and warmer, reinforcing the balance between excitement and gravity that illuminates these songs. It also makes the second disc of demos all the more intriguing, presenting these familiar songs in their most skeletal format. The small flourishes that didn't make the studio versions sound charmingly off-handed: Stipe hums most of ""I Believe"", then punctuates the end with a sing-songy la-la-la. He tries out a harmonica solo on an early version of ""Bad Day"", then uses the instrument to cover for forgotten lyrics. This is R.E.M. at their most ramshackle, a vibe that makes <i>Dead Letter Office</i> a fan favorite even today.</p>
<p><i>Lifes</i> is R.E.M.'s first transition album, one that builds on the innovations of their early releases while hinting at the territory they would cover on <i>Document</i> and <i>Green</i>. It's both epilogue and prologue, yet these songs retain their own specific flavor, as R.E.M. map the borders between small clubs and large venues, between underground and mainstream, between rhythm and melody, between outrage and hope. That in-between quality still sounds invigorating so many years later.</p></div>"|15625.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15625-lifes-rich-pageant-25th-anniversary-edition/|8.8|Stephen M. Deusner

They've developed something of a rep as homespun MOR lifers, with a slight cred advantage in that realm on account of a Mercury Prize win and a modest experimental bent. Still, Gomez have never really made the same record twice. Their latest album's ostensible goal is to bring it all back home and celebrate the band's past 15 years, but doing so in one fell swoop just makes it all the more obvious that they've never managed to develop anything resembling an identity. Who are Gomez after all this time? Whoever they think you want them to be.</p>
<p>Though they'd probably be better off rehashing <i>Bring It On</i>'s supplicant roots-rock in the current climate, <i>Whatever's on Your Mind</i> begins with a fumbled acoustic strum, and after exactly three seconds of human touch, you get all the elbow grease, brow sweat, and rock'n'roll heart of a dubstep record. Cut Gomez and they bleed Purell. The title track and ""Our Goodbye"" are <i>Larry Crowne </i>on wax: chipper and conflict-free calls to let go of the burdens of modernity, oozing string dross and unctuous bromides. Even when Gomez are at least sounding like they're operating from the groin, on ""Equalize"", a Bo Diddley beat is defaced with eroticism run through at least two Babelfish translations (""She's gorgeous when she sleeps/ Be careful not to wake the monster!"") and a drum solo way funnier than the one in <i>Wayne's World.</i></p>
<p>Of course, if <i>Whatever </i>were merely an easygoing and utterly harmless platter of BBQ background music, big deal-- they put one out every two years or so. I guess I never noticed it on previous records, but this album's lyrics reach a fascinating fulcrum where laziness can actually become an act of aggression. After about 10 minutes, you're locked into an extremely discomforting magnetism that goes beyond mere music. This is the rubbernecking world of Smack DVDs and YouTube bum fights.</p>
<p>The cover art is a dead ringer for Gang Starr's greatest hits album, yet I don't think Guru was ever <i>this </i>quotable. Co-vocalist Ian Ball projects with unbothered diction from the roof of his mouth, lending a deadpan absurdity worthy of Dipset to lyrical jewels like this one: ""Light the match/ Burn me down/ Bite the hand/ Bite the sound/ Where's the good in pushing trains from the rail?/ What's so bad about breaking bread going stale/ You hammer the nail."" Meanwhile, Ben Ottewell manages to be the more distinctive singer of the two with a soul-papa bray that recalls Joe Cocker or Eddie Vedder at their most agitated. When he subjects cliché to endurance trials such as ""Please hold on to your heart of gold/ While you struggle against the cold/ You keep dragging that heavy load/ Just let it go,"" it's as transfixing as watching a pitcher in the middle of a perfect game.</p>
<p>Most of this stuff comes from the first half of the record, by the way. But it goes on like that, to the point where you could play a dangerous <i>Whatever's on Your Mind</i> drinking game where you take a shot every time Gomez mix metaphors (""a brick wall's falling apart at the seams"") or string together at least two consecutive clichés and render each completely meaningless (""Kill with kindness is what you do/ Flowers in winter bloom""). Seriously, let's all try to stay safe this summer.</p></div>"|15606.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15606-whatevers-on-your-mind/|2.9|Ian Cohen

A month later, a huge earthquake and tsunami caused the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster</a>. It's healthy to be skeptical about such claims to prescience, but dissembling isn't Jenssen's style: Clearly stated intentions and ideas are a defining feature of the Norwegian ambient-house producer's decades-long career. Plus, <i>N-Plants</i>' sleek contours and foreboding atmosphere easily bear out his theme. Having noted the eerie coincidence, we can dispense with it and let the best Biosphere album since 1997's definitive <i>Substrata </i>stand on its own.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Widely regarded as an ambient milestone, <i>Substrata </i>represented a thoughtful dilettante hitting the reset switch. A period of fertile miscellany followed, from the processed Debussy loops of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/709-shenzhou/"">Shenzhou</a> </i>to the long-tone sci-fi marathon <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/710-autour-de-la-lune/"">Autour de la Lune</a></i>. Like <i>Substrata</i>, <i>N-Plants</i> is both a consummation and a palate-cleanser. Fully in ambient-house mode, Jenssen fashions together hazy drones, filtered synthesizers, microhouse percussion, and haunting vocal samples over classically plumb lines. Like Kate Simko's 2009 <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13137-music-from-the-atom-smashers/"">soundtrack for <i>The Atom Smashers</i></a>, the album can evoke particles of energy swarming through elegant, hulking metal curves. But this one-time archaeology student has never given up his field's patient curiosity and long view, and<i> N-Plants</i> can't be fully constrained by modern context. Ages of ice and stone drift through it, and the Arctic Circle is a looming presence.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Each process on <i>N-Plants</i>, be it a glinting synthesizer motif or a low-scudding bass line, logically catalyzes the next. Where <i>Substrata</i> delved deeper and deeper, <i>N-Plants</i> glides over level, endlessly scrolling surfaces. The tracks don't essentially change. At most, they metastasize, as on ""Sendai-1"", where a synthesizer plays iridescently through an aquatic atmosphere; at minimum, cycles of loops perpetually revolve, as on ""Genkai-1"". Either way, blissful hypnosis ensues. <i>N-Plants</i> is a master craftsman's reaffirmation of a fundamental but lapsed tenet of electronic ambient: You set up a conversation between the machines, and then you step out of the way.</p></div>"|15626.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15626-n-plants/|8.0|Brian Howe

It was a lush, loop-fed effort that found Van Pelt, formerly a major part of Montreal indie-poppers Think About Life, working with electronic melodies and textures. Nearly everywhere you turned, there was a rich sound or hook or surface to uncover, even if the songwriting frameworks didn't always click. In <i>Was I the Wave?</i>, Van Pelt's first batch of recordings since, he has crafted a record as sleek as it is introverted.</p>
<p>Van Pelt has largely shifted his energies here from texture to rhythm, resulting in beat-driven music that sacrifices color (one might also say clutter) for clean lines. Scaling back and toning up lends what's here a new focus; the production values seem purely in service of the song, almost all of which feel like they're presented in easy gelcap form. On Foals-like ""Tracers"", Van Pelt tops a stutter-stepping bass figure and drum machine with sheets of guitar tremolo. Everything is smoothed and stacked seamlessly. If you wanted to follow a bleep or bloop or warble or corkscrewing guitar for a few extra bars, you wouldn't get too far.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, <i>Was I the Wave?</i> features a healthy portion of instrumental interludes, most of which tend to be shorter and more claustrophobic by comparison. While <i>Five Roses</i>' title track was a full-blown experience unto itself, both ""Wave"" and ""Before"" function as quick drone experiments that whine and yawn for introduction's sake; both also jumpstart this record's finest moments. Be it in the curling vocal melody of ""Spectre"" or the precise, high-altitude moves of ""Miscalculations"", each boasts the kind of vital signs missing from the cold arpeggios of, say, first single ""Raw Spectacle"". While Van Pelt has crafted an album that's sharper in most ways than his debut, it could do with a bit more of these tracks' personality and sense of melodic wonder.</p></div>"|15638.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15638-was-i-the-wave/|7.2|David Bevan

But it's his adventurousness that makes him so valuable. Beginning with the <i>Macro Dub Infection</i> compilations he put together for Virgin in the 1990s, Martin has been just as interested in the way Jamaican pop has been reinterpreted, mutated, and even perverted by outside influence as he is with tracking its history at home. Martin assembled this year's <i>Invasion of the Mysteron Killer Sounds</i> with Stuart Baker, the head of Soul Jazz, a UK label that is itself a longtime champion of Jamaican sound system culture. The two discs work as a whistle-stop tour of post-digital Jamaican music, but they also highlight the ways dancehall has spread around the globe, twisting itself into almost unrecognizable shapes along the way.</p>
<p>Built largely around instrumentals, <i>Mysteron</i> jumps from Jamaican dons cranking out essentialist beats to U.S. producers like Diplo making tracks for a wired worldwide audience. While the minimalism of some tracks might test the patience of those who aren't already beat freaks, Martin and Baker's selection is a perfect way to learn about the outlandish, shouldn't-be-this-funky things Jamaican producers (and their far-flung acolytes) have been doing to rhythm for almost three decades now. With its delirious beat clonking from one headphone to another, Andre ""Suku"" Gray's ""Sign Rhythm"" sounds both tribal and cybernetic, and you can marvel at the way Gray has made these super-heavy drums dance around the mix. The ""Sign Rhythm"" also has a hook that sounds like a tea kettle's whistle or a broken kazoo, which is a pretty good indicator of how far-out Jamaican producers will go in search of texture. Firehouse Crew's ""No False Hair"" has a sprinkle of familiar Caribbean steel drums, but good luck hearing them fighting their way out of the riot of gabba-grade drums, game-over effects, and (because it wasn't deranged enough) a slide whistle. One of those cuts is from the 00s, the other from the 90s, both unique and at the same time utterly dancehall.</p>
<p><i>Mysteron</i> is no history lesson, but it should give new-to-ragga listeners a sense of dancehall's evolution, even if they have to puzzle it out through repeat listens. The 80s cuts collected here, from when reggae and dub giants like King Tubby (""Fat Thing"") and Prince Jazzbo (""Great Stone"") went digital after the genre-changing success of Wayne Smith's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p_xEZWAtow"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Under Mi Sleng Teng</a>"", still have plenty of reggae's skank; they squeeze as much of the old live-band swing as possible from drum machines and synthetic bass. By the 90s, beats like Fat Eyes' ""Steel Plate"" and Steely &amp; Clevie's ""Streetsweeper"" had become strange and strident, full of ominous negative space. By the 21st century, Jamaican producers were searching even further afield for fresh sounds, whether the agitated double-dutch clapping of Lenky's ""Diwali"" or island acid house of South Rakkas Crew's ""Red Alert"". <i>Mysteron</i> tends toward the tense and fierce, but there's room for chill beauty, too. Kickin Productions' placid but driving ""What You Gonna Do"", for instance, is a merger of old-school reggae and new-school rhythm programming that looks both backward and forward while being totally captivating. Which is a pretty good way to describe <i>Mysteron</i> as a whole.</p></div>"|15630.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15630-invasion-of-the-mysteron-killer-sounds/|7.9|Jess Harvell

When his first Hyperdub singles began to attract notice in 2008, he was part of a wave of post-dubstep producers who drew as much from synth-driven 1980s film scores, 8-bit era video game soundtracks, and electro as they did from Jamaica, hip-hop, or UK garage. True, his output wasn't as garish and noisy and abrasive as those made by some of his more intractable collaborators and remixers, and he used the EP format to experiment with tracks more ambient-leaning than club-ready. But they still had distorted riffs, the kind of low-end that makes you adjust your stereo settings to avoid frying your speakers, and hooks more Capcom than Kraftwerk.</p>
<p>His first proper album, 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12543-where-were-u-in-92/"" target=""_blank""><i>Where Were U in </i>'<i>92?</i></a>, even ditched dubstep entirely to recreate the unruly spirit of the genre's ancestor, hardcore rave. The album sounded far more fine-tuned-- and far less cheap-- than most of the hardcore tunes it paid homage to. But it also suggested Zomby wanted nothing to do with the kind of listener who throws on an electronic album as unobtrusive background noise. If his not-quite-dubstep peer Lone brings the pacific and beatific side of early rave into modern UK beat culture, Zomby brings in the roughness, the menace, the boldness. Even when he goes for almost-beatless psychedelic beauty-- check <a href=""%E2%80%9Chttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eagkV6aU3II%E2%80%9D"">""Mercury's Rainbow""</a>-- the results have a disorienting intensity, like John Carpenter incidental music on fast-forward and with the bass at +8.</p>
<p>Although it's barely longer than some of his EPs, <i>Dedication</i> is being sold as Zomby's second album, and it's also the strangest, most low-key, and least dance-friendly record he's released yet. It's hard to say to whom <i>Dedication</i> is aimed-- certainly not hardcore dubstep fanatics-- and that's part of its perverse charm, especially since everyone was likely expecting a cohesive, scene-summarizing statement given that this is Zomby's debut for big-time indie label 4AD. It's too jittery and restless and rhythmic to work as comfy ambient music. But while it's very obviously designed to be <i>listened to</i> rather than politely ignored, its choppy transitions and abrupt shifts in mood means it doesn't always flow the way we expect of albums or even home-listening DJ sets. In a way it reminds me of the same hermetic and stuck-between-worlds sound Boards of Canada were mining circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/837-geogaddi/"" target=""_blank""><i>Geogaddi</i></a>, alternating crunchy beat experiments with ethereal sound-washes and sometimes blurring the two modes together. <i>Dedication</i> never quite reaches (or aims for) the same scope or grandeur as BOC; it's a weirdly <i>personal</i> record, the kind made by a studio loner stringing together little oddities. So maybe call it Zomby's private reels made public, an audio sketchbook filled up with haunted miniatures, something to marvel over if never quite immerse yourself in.</p>
<p>It's certainly the most stylistically wide-ranging record he's released yet. It's got some of what Zomby fans have come to love, those icy arcade game sound effects stamped into brief club tracks (""Digital Rain""), but just as often the album chases unexpected directions. For a guy not known for his love of atmospheric murk <i>or</i> soulful smoothness, the blurred vocals on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12200-natalias-song/"" target=""_blank"">Natalia's Song</a>"" evoke the downcast vibe of Burial with just a hint of the Art of Noise circa the sensuous ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIcmIhOesaI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Moments in Love</a>"". For a guy not known for working with singers, on ""Things Fall Apart"" Zomby drafts Noah ""Panda Bear"" Lennox  as left-field diva, re-imagining the droning repetitions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15299-tomboy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tomboy</i></a> as techno for kids who grew up reading <i>Nintendo Power</i>. But throughout <i>Dedication</i> you're struck by how assured Zomby is with textures outside of ""game cartridge kitsch,"" how he refuses to be slotted into an already-dated subgenre for marketing purposes. ""Haunted"" is like a computer-assisted take on the pensive soundtrack-jazz of DJ Shadow circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2377-endtroducing-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Endtroducing...</i></a> with the vinyl crackle cleaned off. When the beats drop away entirely here, you're more likely to somber acoustic piano (""Basquiat"") than glossy, unnatural keyboards.</p>
<p>Barring a few exceptions, <i>Dedication</i> lacks the wobbly jump-up energy of Zomby's best-loved early singles and the rave-y mania of <i>Where Were U in </i>'<i>92</i>. He's more inventive with rhythm than ever; they're just not the kind of rhythms you might have expected. With their finger-snap drums and bass ooze and queasy synths, ""Witch Hunt"" and ""Lucifer"" have the sluggish gravity of Southern hip-hop and grime, outdoing acts like Salem in approximately one-third the time and with no sketchy rapping to dull their creepy pleasures. An entire album of tracks like that might have made for an easy hit, given Zomby's profile and the buzz around similarly druggy instrumental rap from producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a> and the wonky trip-hop of the Brainfeeder crew, but Zomby won't make it that easy on himself. Though it doesn't sound like the work of a show-off, <i>Dedication</i> is in many ways the work of a producer pushing himself to see how hard and how far he can push his music into new places. Some might lament the fact that so many tracks feel like teasers pointing toward something longer and more developed, with most of these two- or three-minute ideas fading out as soon as they get a good, eerie groove going. If so, you can take comfort that he's given himself so many possibilities for album number three. Just don't expect a producer this perverse to follow up on any of them, let alone all of them.</p></div>"|15617.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15617-dedication/|7.6|Jess Harvell

This M.O. of ambitious itchiness was one Eleanor and her brother Matthew would only intensify with albums to come, including the sprawling landmark <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3272-blueberry-boat/"" target=""_blank""><i>Blueberry Boat</i></a>, the conceptually brave family affair <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3274-rehearsing-my-choir/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rehearsing My Choir</i></a>, and the Frankensteinian live document <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12122-remember/"" target=""_blank""><i>Remember</i></a>.</p>
<p>But a funny thing happened with the female Friedberger on the Furnaces' manifold zigzagging journeys from point A to point Z. Instead of just yelping or intoning strings of verbiage, Eleanor started to inform her delivery with nuance, irony, and wisdom. By 2007's terrific <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10756-widow-city/"" target=""_blank""><i>Widow City</i></a>, the precocious hepcat of the group's early efforts was achieving real pathos on songs like ""My Egyptian Grammar"". The maturation deepened with 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13220-im-going-away/"" target=""_blank""><i>I'm Going Away</i></a>, which found Friedberger not only displaying increased subtlety as a singer but also taking a greater hand in crafting lyrics and melodies. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was the Furnaces' most polished and measured work to date.</p>
<p>Friedberger's debut solo album thoroughly carries over this relatively nascent understanding of her as an artist who can deliver sturdily professional, affecting pop. In fact, <i>Last Summer</i> practically makes <i>I'm Going Away</i> sound like one of the Furnaces' more madcap offerings by comparison. Simple but lovely piano melodies and richly mellow bass shepherd most of the tracks here, though Friedberger has paid lots of attention to filling the album's ample breathing spaces with guitar fills and percussive coloring. The warmly recorded, light-treading effort feels like a throwback to idiosyncratic but solidly crafted albums made in the 1970s by piano-driven popsmiths like Harry Nilsson, Todd Rundgren, and Joni Mitchell.</p>
<p>""Idiosyncratic"" is an important qualifier. The success of <i>Last Summer</i> hinges on Friedberger's ability to put across a vocal and lyrical persona that excuses the fact that her tunes, while finely wrought, are hardly groundbreaking. As a vocalist she ably blends tough-minded forthrightness with a capacity for empathy and vulnerability. That's part of the reason why she can flirt overtly with girl-group sounds (""Heaven""), Motown (""I Won't Fall Apart on You Tonight""), and funk (""Roosevelt Island"") without seeming like an empty-vessel revivalist. It's what really good artists do-- they get away with occasional genre exercise and pastiche because the force of their own personality overrides any potential slavishness in the songwriting.</p>
<p>Nor has Friedberger sacrificed any of the serpentine panache of her lyrics. The strict sense of her stories may not always be easy to parse, but their logical slipperiness only strengthens the shifting feelings of longing, loss, estrangement, or nostalgia they convey. Friedberger keeps to the Furnaces' longstanding preoccupation with geography but narrows her scope in a way that heightens the album's sense of intimacy. Aside from ""Inn of the Seventh Ray"", which refers to an acclaimed California locale, <i>Last Summer</i> is all about New York, particularly Brooklyn. But Friedberger isn't interested in name-dropping Williamsburg's hippest bars, preferring to mention old neighborhoods and recreational attractions. Especially given the album's general 70s vibe, <i>Last Summer</i> feels much more like one of Woody Allen's classic cinematic love letters to the Big Apple than the work of any 21st-century scenester. From an artist whose mind and appetites have always ranged so freely, such a cohesive, uncluttered document is doubly revealing.</p></div>"|15623.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15623-last-summer/|7.9|Joshua Love

Mark Foster sings on <a href=""http://www.fosterthepeople.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Foster the People</a>'s first album, before adding defiantly, ""Who cares?"" Later, he punctuates ""Call It What You Want"" with the declaration, ""What I got can't be bought."" With just a few catchy singles and a reputation for energetic live shows, this L.A. trio already sounds defensive and cagey, as if bristling from some imagined attack. We've heard their sort of scene dissection before, mostly from younger bands entering a fractious pop arena (Arctic Monkeys, for instance), but Foster the People-- at distinct odds with their nurturing moniker-- seem to be daring you to categorize them, assess them, or, hell, even engage with them. By way of introduction, it's a bit off-putting, especially soundtracked by demonstratively upbeat West Coast indie-pop buzzed on disco-infused vodka.</p>
<p>Once you get past the genre paranoia, <i>Torches</i> actually has enough going for it that Foster the People could conceivably make those same points through their music rather than their lyrics. The songs dodge and weave stylistically, avoiding perceived critical jabs by scavenging pop history for new old sounds. Foster's falsetto alternately evokes Jamiroquai and Mercury Rev's Jonathan Donahue-- surely the only overlap between those two performers-- while his keyboards volley between <a href=""http://youtu.be/WCTNGAbukEY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">early-90s radio dance pop</a> and more recent MGMT doodles. Foster the People's proud maximalism also extends cannily to their songwriting. Foster can write a chorus so bold and simple that you can hear it once and sing it for a fortnight, a tactic that has already made minor hits of ""Helena Beat"" and ""Pumped Up Kicks"" (the latter of which promotes hipster-on-hipster violence).</p>
<p>Particularly hoisted onto such dense production, the hooks are so big, blunt, and persistent that even my four-year-old niece counts Foster the People as her favorite band. But on <i>Torches</i> that plays as a crutch as well as a strength. For example, the band runs a two-line melody into the ground on ""I Would Do Anything for You"", never building on it or allowing it to evolve in any way. Still, when this earworm-core works, as on the singles, its pleasures are perfectly modest and enthralling. All of which makes the group's dodginess only more distracting-- no less so considering their rapid successes: a major-label deal, a <i>Billboard</i> top 10 debut, a coveted slot at Lollapalooza, and the devotion of at least one fan who prefers them over the Wiggles or Odd Future. Listing those accomplishments may strike Foster the People as an accusation of selling out, but seriously, relax. As the song that's wedged into my cerebellum goes, ""Who cares?""</p></div>"|15611.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15611-torches/|6.2|Stephen M. Deusner

A few bands became popular during that period (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27360-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"" target=""_blank"">the Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5753-crystal-stilts/"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Stilts</a>), others developed a modest but reverential fan base (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6875-cause-co-motion/"" target=""_blank"">caUSE co-MOTION!</a>), and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/380-black-tambourine/"" target=""_blank"">Black Tambourine</a>-- the very reason Slumberland was founded in the first place-- released an anthology at the height of their renewed influential status. One Slumberland group that went slightly overlooked was San Francisco's <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/brilliantcolorssanfrancisco"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brilliant Colors</a>, who quietly released a 23-minute platter of driving noise-pop called <i>Introducing</i>. With the trend circus that descended upon the genre having moved on to other areas of the music spectrum, Slumberland continues to be the genre's premier label. And Brilliant Colors ever so slightly deviate from their chosen template and deliver another solid album with <i>Again and Again</i>.</p>
<p>Here, the breathy vocals aren't buried in the mix so much as lightly blanketed, and the thin singing is naturally overpowered by the clang of the instruments instead of one vocal track being dominated by seven layers of recorded guitars. Opener ""Hey Dan"" sets the pace for an album that is more diaphanous than its predecessor, replacing the punkish twee of <i>Introducing</i> with a more classic guitar pop vibe. While <i>Introducing</i> standouts ""Should I Tell You"" and ""Over There"" prominently featured trebly, fried guitars, the songs of <i>Again and Again</i> cast the bright, summery chord progressions into an autumnal haze, rendering songs like ""Painting Truths"" and ""Value Lines"" more wistful than most of the tunes on their debut.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <i>Again and Again</i> suffers the same fate as the Brilliant Colors album that came before it, regardless of exploring a different sound. A lot of the songs are so similar to the ear that it's hard to differentiate most of them between each other; confusing ""How Much Younger"" and ""Hitting Traffic"" is a particularly easy feat. The album's clear highlight is ""Back to the Tricks"", with its driving tension and dramatic chorus providing a well-needed dark spot of mounting anxiety right in the middle of an album rife with major chords and plaintive emotion. As genuinely good as the song is, it ultimately becomes the most memorable tune on <i>Again and Again</i> by default, finding the band stepping out of their comfort zone and throwing their well-played caution to the wind.</p>
<p>In the context of Slumberland, Brilliant Colors provide a fair middle ground between the aforementioned Pains and Stilts, neither as capital-P Pop as the former nor as brazenly psychedelic as the latter. While they're still a talented band, you can't help but wonder how much more memorable they'd be if they applied as broad a sense of dynamics to their albums as their labelmates.</p></div>"|15622.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15622-again-and-again/|6.8|Martin Douglas

From Nashville country sessions to New York improvisational explorations, the player who can play it all is the player who will likely have gigs. For instance, while cellist Erik Friedlander has played with John Zorn's Masada Chamber Ensemble and with reed adventurer Ned Rothenberg, he's also worked with Korn, Kelly Clarkson, and the Mountain Goats. While <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29454-colin-stetson/"" target=""_blank"">Colin Stetson</a>'s star is rising with his new solo opus, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15166-new-history-of-warfare-vol-2-judges/"" target=""_blank""><i>New History Warfare Vol. 2: Judges</i></a>, he's long kept busy with bands from Bon Iver and the National to Angélique Kidjo and Arcade Fire. This is true for guitar soloists, too, but in this realm, the mastery of multiple forms seems to have less to do with a paycheck and more to do with proving you're more than some new-school John Fahey acolyte. From Sir Richard Bishop's pan-everything albums to William Tyler's expansive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14999-behold-the-spirit/"" target=""_blank""><i>Behold the Spirit</i></a>, some of the best guitar music being made right now is that which takes the world in and sounds it back out through a pair of busy hands.</p>
<p>Thankfully, no one bothered to tell young Irish guitarist Cian Nugent about that approach: His first widely available album, <i>Doubles</i>, comprises two side-length tracks that take definitive and defined approaches the distance. There's no emphasis on how much he can do or how much he has studied his forebears; instead, he smartly focuses on developing a pair of immersive environments that are continuously compelling for more than 20 minutes at a time. He nails it. The first side, ""Peaks &amp; Troughs"", is an ambitious solo workout for guitar and, eventually, synthesizer. As its name suggests, the tune rises to loud, heavy strums and falls to near-silent picking. A more accurate title might have been ""Knots &amp; Threads"", as Nugent's emphasis seems to be on the horizontal orientation of his music-- that is, the volume matters less than the way he arranges and links his phrases. At points, his hands are busy wrangling great messes of notes that eventually thin out into beautiful and relatively simple statements of melody. Sometimes, though, Nugent is content to examine one note or chord until it resolves into silence, as if he's staring at a huge, tangled ball of yarn but concentrating only on a small, isolated knot somewhere near the middle. That movement creates an inescapable momentum, meaning that, when this track starts, Nugent's deliberately dynamic approach makes it hard to ignore.</p>
<p>That same kinetic energy applies to the grand and arching ""Sixes &amp; Sevens"", a piece that Nugent developed with a large ensemble of friends playing drums, strings, horns, and keys. A piece of quiet triumph, ""Sixes &amp; Sevens"" builds around the obvious, continuous guitar line that runs throughout its 24 minutes. Nugent tucks the revelation that he's been listening to music beyond past masters of instrumental guitar into those near-orchestral flourishes. He hints at a free-jazz maelstrom one moment, eerie organ drone music the next; much later, there's a touch of shoegaze rock thanks to some long-tone distortion and a bit of Japanese minimalism via the restraint of the percussion. The perfectly ebullient passages are a mix of Stravinsky, hard bop, and unrepentant pop; given its redemptive sound, it's where the listener finally understands that versatility is something the young Nugent values, too.</p>
<p>If <i>Doubles</i> has a fault, it's that Nugent makes no attempt to hide his influences or to do something they haven't previously done. This is, after all, a form that has often been beleaguered by its own reverence and subservience to idols; its recent renaissance, however, suggests the time for showing you can do what someone else once did has begun to recede. Fahey, Rose, Jones, Blackshaw-- all of the top-shelf names in this realm have gone for extended ruminations in the vein of ""Peaks &amp; Troughs"". And Jim O'Rourke stands as the acknowledged master of epics such as ""Sixes &amp; Sevens"", which rise steadily and delicately to glorious but restrained crescendos. Nugent doesn't reinvent either idea on <i>Doubles</i>, but he doesn't have to; he's inarguably mastered them and made them his own, and that's enough for a start.</p></div>"|15618.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15618-doubles/|7.7|Grayson Currin

Synthesizers are in; guitar-based rock has taken a backseat to diffuse, rhythmic dance music; and the sound's key influences (broken, blissed-out electronica, hip-hop) have leached into most interesting music happening right now.</p>
<p>So, where does a significant subgenre defined by the less-than-lofty goal of manufacturing good vibes go next? The artists either do the same thing with the same synth presets to diminishing returns (Memory Tapes, Small Black, Teen Daze) or they pull a Toro Y Moi on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15129-underneath-the-pine/"" target=""_blank""><i>Underneath the Pine</i></a> and morph into something different altogether. The former creates music that can seem a little too comfortable, and the latter, while admirable, could come over as a bit alarmist-- a calculated response to the critics.</p>
<p>The first full-length from <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thebabeinthewoods"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Washed Out</a> doesn't have an on-repeat banger like ""Feel It All Around"" on it, and it isn't a sea change. Instead it's a sly, solid release that can fade into the background but has the ability to jump out and take hold of your ears. It sounds great on headphones and even better coming out of speakers in a car or at a party, where it can breathe a little. When Washed Out's Ernest Greene <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/guest-lists/7995-washed-out/"">spoke to <i>Pitchfork</i> recently</a>, he noted that he was working on the album in the same place that Goodie Mob were hammering out their reunion album. Quite different from the laptop on mom and dad's back porch that birthed <i>Life of Leisure</i>.</p>
<p>Ben Allen, who helped beef up Animal Collective's sound for <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i>, produced the album, and while <i>Within and Without</i> isn't too shiny or expensive, the more professional approach rewards multiple listens. There are delicate, lasting production flourishes like the cracking  snares on ""Echoes"" and the impenetrable web of fashion-show synths on  ""Before"" that give way to an agitated disco-like jerk. Drums are bold and complex, reflecting the almost Pete Rock-aping found on Washed Out's tour-only <i>Untitled EP</i>, and live instruments are used for atmosphere the way samples were before. One of the most chilling, affecting moments of <i>Within and Without</i> happens when cello swings through ""Far Away"".</p>
<p>The album's also very sensual and not just because of the American Apparel-lite album cover. Its beats slink along like those <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZLGgbHCURg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Public Enemy drums</a> creeping through <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESxJJK3QsnM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Madonna's ""Justify My Love""</a>, and there's a lush, snowy warmth to the production (one of the songs is even called ""Soft""). No longer a stand-alone Adult Swim-released single, ""You And I"", featuring Chairlift's Caroline Polachek, is the soundtrack to a tender, Sunday morning make-out session, and well, just listen to that throbbing bassline. ""Sade but a bit more shy,"" or ""Trip-hop intended for making love rather than <i>fucking</i>"" kinda describes what's going on here. ""A Dedication"", the album ender, eschews airy ornate production for fragile piano and Greene's least mumbly, most direct vocal performance. It's a purposeful period at the end of the album; the point where the record stops worrying about dancing and seems intent to curl up and get cozy.</p>
<p><i>Within and Without</i> is a declaration to snarky ironists that there is nothing to be ashamed of with this sound. ""Feel It All Around"", Neon Indian's ""Should Have Taken Acid With You"", and Toro Y Moi's ""Blessa"" entered this rarefied, awesome space between indie pop catchiness and fragile, narcotic groove, and here's a whole album of tracks on that level. That it comes at a time when others have abandoned the genre or quickly jumped on and then off to raise the stakes and get respectable, is even more impressive. Greene has made an  elegant, subtle album in a genre that primarily values the single mp3 and, every once in a while, a 12"" or cassette tape. <i>Within and Without</i> is an excellent demonstration of what happens when, even after the buzz-band cycle has faded, you continue to investigate a sound on your own hushed, ambitious terms.</p></div>"|15614.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15614-within-and-without/|8.3|Brandon Soderberg

There's enough hurtling Echoplex riffs and organ squall to freak out the squares, but it's all wrapped in three-minute chunks, with verses, choruses, and bridges, prog-psych with all the boring parts sucked out. But despite that opening, just about everything else surrounding the band has changed, and not necessarily for the better. After inking a deal to legendary indie label Touch and Go on the strength of their <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11580-ep/"" target=""_blank"">scalding EP</a>, most listeners caught up with them on 2009's <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12847-tentacles/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tentacles</i></a>. That record was far from a flop, but it was nonetheless a mild letdown, an album saddled by unsteady direction and brittle production. But even if it delivered the goods, it might not have mattered: due to an assortment of financial troubles and a subsequent ""drastic downsizing,"" <i>Tentacles</i> stands as the last new record released by Touch and Go.</p>
<p>And while there are times here when Crystal Antlers forego their whiplash unpredictability and seem almost too in control of their sound on <i>Two-Way Mirror</i>, they're clearly reinvigorated. The most noticeable changes are almost completely cosmetic: though they'll never be pretty, <i>Mirror</i> is far easier to face head-on, dialing back the trebly sizzle of its predecessor into a more comfortable, analog warmth. But the major point is how they've managed to fully integrate slivers of gentler sounds-- hints of surf-rock, lo-fi folk, and drone-- and it feels like growth as opposed to acquiescence. Though Crystal Antlers took steps towards accessibility on <i>Tentacles</i>, bassist/vocalist Jonny Bell went along for the ride kicking and screaming. Not sure when the ""On"" switch got hit, but Bell finally can be described as a ""singer"" more than a mere ""vocalist,"" and the lyrics feel like the product of a point of view rather than placeholders.</p>
<p>The success of <i>Two-Way Mirror</i> as a whole is mostly borne of fine-tuning, but ""Summer Solstice"" is the keeper on account of its<br> being the most stunning display of ambition here. It's a near-total stylistic dismantling proving the distance between Comets on Fire and <i>The Photo Album</i>-era Death Cab For Cutie could be traversed in three minutes. A churning, distorted bassline cuts through chimes; vigorous tom-rolls and an ascending chorus of halting sighs are very much in the style of Ben Gibbard, albeit far chestier. Even without the video, there's still an undercurrent of vulnerability that you never really got from these guys before, and it's a legitimately new and exciting direction. Previous singles ""Andrew"" and ""<a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11825-little-sister/"" target=""_blank"">Little Sister</a>"" were nice enough on their own in terms of pushing Crystal Antlers to something more melodic, but sliding into black-lit blooze rock felt like an otherwise restless band taking the path of least resistance.</br></p>
<p>It's a triumph of novelty meeting execution, and the best moments here are when they go the furthest lengths not to repeat themselves. I'm sure it'll slay live-- most Crystal Antlers songs do anyway-- but clearly experimental tracks like the drone-and-bongo instrumental ""Way Out"" and the self-explanatory acid-folk of ""Sun-Bleached"" serve as chances to let the surrounding assault sink in. In addition to being a strong return to form, <i>Two-Way Mirror</i> gives Crystal Antlers some much needed momentum after an unfortunate run of bad timing and bad luck.  Though they're from Long Beach, they do offer some sort of peripheral artistic brotherhood with the teeming retro movement going on in San Francisco. Sure, they might not have the classicist songwriting chops of the Fresh &amp; Onlys or Sonny and the Sunsets, but none of those bands rock this hard either. That stuff is for summer BBQs and backyard parties; <i>Two-Way Mirror</i> is what to spin at the point when you stop caring about noise complaints.</p></div>"|15593.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15593-two-way-mirror/|7.0|Ian Cohen

That song made you weep. How could you be so mean, to the boy you longed to meet?"" This is the first line of ""Besides You"", a late-album beauty on <i>Are You Falling in Love?</i>, the debut LP from Atlanta indie poppers <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thegoldbears"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gold-Bears</a>. A little bit emo, a little bit twee, this one lyric is actually striking more for its date-dropping than than its emotional overtones. It fits really well. These four share a lot of DNA with Slumberland labelmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27360-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"" target=""_blank"">the Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a>. But where the latter initially couched their melodies in the ""noise"" of late-80s noise-pop (they've since swapped that out for the sear of Smashing Pumpkins' guitar squall), Gold-Bears favor the dreamy, moody, semi-blurry sounds Yo La Tengo built their reputation on in the early to mid-90s. All waves of revivalism and nostalgia aside, <i>Are You Falling Love?</i> sounds like it was beamed in straight from 1993.</p>
<p>The band works within this particular framework exceedingly well. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15715-record-store/"" target=""_blank"">Record Store</a>"" is a tear-streaked, full-tilt opener that leaves a whole lot of foam and fizz in its wake. ""So Natural"" boasts equal amounts of verve, save for a gentle bell melody in its second half. From there the title track coasts into a field of drone, a psychedelic space where Gold-Bears set themselves apart from a lot of their contemporaries. There's no shortage of energy here-- this band can zoom from one row of jangly, interlocking guitar melodies to the next, the sax-laced ""East Station Attendant"" and sugary peaks of ""Totally Called It"" one particularly great mark-- but when they make room to fuck around more intensely with volume and texture, the results can dazzle.</p>
<p>Chief songwriter Jeremy Underwood doesn't leave a lot unsaid, packing his poetry in very tightly. And whether or not you've got a heart for the relatively twee, lovesick couplets he's letting loose, a change of pace suits him well. He sings the first several bars of closer ""Yeah, Tonight"" cloaked in echo, an acoustic guitar rattling around at his fingers. There's some word-blurring kick drum and a few spears of guitar noise sent through negative space, but for the most part, this is a stripped down version of most everything else you'll find here. But as this song gains momentum, it blooms into a less strained iteration of what they already do well. ""Tonight we'll fall in love and love again,"" Underwood coos just before he up and pulls a Malkmus: ""And then the drums come in..."" What happens next is a lot like Gold-Bears and <i>Are You Falling in Love?</i>: a pleasant surprise.</p></div>"|15627.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15627-are-you-falling-in-love/|7.6|David Bevan

Like Joanna Newsom's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9616-ys/"" target=""_blank"">Ys</a> </i>and Bat for Lashes' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12910-two-suns/"" target=""_blank""><i>Two Suns</i></a>, among other records, the second album from London singer-songwriter Emma-Lee Moss establishes its central themes and ideas visually before anyone plays a note. As with many such visually upfront records, <i>Virtue</i> is also a conceptually unified listen, influenced heavily by a broken engagement to a man who decided becoming a Christian missionary was a better idea than marrying Moss, otherwise known as <a href=""http://www.emmythegreat.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Emmy the Great</a>.</p>
<p>The offbeat nature of <i>Virtue</i>'s artwork extends to its music, as well, though not always successfully. Opener ""Dinosaur Sex"" may have an attention-grabbing title, but despite a creaking, Mesozoic breakdown, the song tends to sag beneath the weight of a less-than-subtle narrative about how one day everything dies. On ""Paper Forest (In the Afterglow of Rapture)"", Moss compares the end of a relationship to something of biblical proportions-- another idea that's interesting in theory, but clumsy and unconvincing in execution.</p>
<p>Still, quite a few of the songs here have some nice touches. ""Creation"" adds a spooky synth veneer to bleak electric guitar chords. ""Sylvia"" also benefits from a more electronic feel, with a bouncy synth bass propelling the song lightly alongside a brisk drumbeat. It's probably the poppiest moment on the record, and when vocal harmonies appear towards the end, they carry an airy momentum that's easy to get onboard with.</p>
<p>In fact, <i>Virtue </i>comes across best when Moss is at her least kooky. On ""Trellick Tower"", she paints a disarmingly wounded picture over solo piano: ""In those days of living gently/ Something holy used to love me,"" she sings. In this context, free from all the overcooked symbolism, Moss' story at last becomes truly engaging. It's a frustrating hint that when she isn't putting her quirks in the foreground, Emmy the Great can be an appealing, compelling figure in her own right.</p></div>"|15565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15565-virtue/|6.3|Hari Ashurst

His best songs are spare, nervy miniatures about puppy love riddled by anxiety-- an anxiety Holly made manifest in itchy percussive tracks and an inability to sing more than two lines without breaking into hiccups, the musical equivalent of sweaty palms. (This was in the late 1950s, when non-verbal ejaculations-- vocal or  rhythmic-- were the closest a pop singer could get to talking about sex,  a time when sex was broken down into gesture and metaphor).</p>
<p>Holly's legacy in contemporary music is unclear-- a lot less clear than, well, Elvis or the Beatles. <i>Rave On</i>, a collection of covers released on the anniversary of what would've been his 75th birthday doesn't make it clearer. On a purely instinctual level, it's puffy and depressing, like one of those cable arts-network specials in which a series of talking heads in comfortable-looking chairs say hyperbolically admiring things about dead people everyone agrees the collective ""we"" should respect, but don't actually seem very interested in the dead person at hand. It's an exercise in celebrity that encourages the idea that famous people have mystical ways of relating to each other and the world around them. Until hearing <i>Rave On</i>, for example, I had not thought much about the relationship between Buddy Holly and Kid Rock. Now I have, and I understand it slightly less than I did before.</p>
<p>I have no need in my life for very literal performances of songs like ""Everyday"" by people like Fiona Apple, for example, not because I dislike people like Fiona Apple but because 1) the original ""Everyday"" still sounds good to me; and 2) literal performances of songs like ""Everyday"" by people like Fiona Apple make me feel spiritually manipulated: If the same recording had been performed by a singer not named Fiona Apple, I don't think it would've been released.</p>
<p>Most of <i>Rave On</i> is just tedious that way. Julian Casablancas sounds bored. Modest Mouse sound bored. Kid Rock sounds like he's trying to sing like Otis Redding but sounds like neither Otis Redding nor Kid Rock. Karen Elson, Jenny O., and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42803-hear-she-hims-buddy-holly-cover/"" target=""_blank"">Zooey Deschanel</a> all sound nervous and coy and almost indistinguishable. My Morning Jacket's version of ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42698-listen-my-morning-jacket-cover-buddy-holly/"" target=""_blank"">True Love Ways</a>""-- one of several songs Holly recorded with an orchestra after breaking up his band, the Crickets-- is the only straight-laced cover that transcends its surroundings, in part because I think the song's unimpeachable to begin with, in part because Jim James' high, whittling voice seems preternaturally well-suited to the song's tone: blissful and sweet, but backlit by melancholy.</p>
<p>The departures from the originals are generally more entertaining than the straight readings. Lou Reed, an under-appreciated humorist, sings ""Peggy Sue"" with the aimless intensity of a very drunk person grinding through karaoke. ""It's So Easy""-- a song Holly originally sang with a gee-whiz kind of tone-- is turned into a noisy blues about how hard it is to control yourself when you're horny. Happily, comfortingly, it is sung by Paul McCartney, the only Beatle funny enough to write a song about his sheepdog. Patti Smith sings ""Words of Love"", maybe my single favorite Holly song  and arguably the genesis of dream-pop. Against all personally  established odds, it's stunning, an example of how a jagged, vulnerable  voice like Smith's can play against an arrangement so thin it keeps  threatening to dissolve-- a basic and effective study in contrast. These covers are fun. They're spirited. They're slightly disrespectful, and in being slightly disrespectful, they feel like a true tribute and consideration of Holly's idiosyncratic spirit.</p>
<p>Maybe the fundamental problem is that the compilation's ""Y'all come!"" inclusivity and eagerness to show just how many artists, young and old, love Buddy Holly, has a cold and windy void where its heart should be. In trying to please everyone-- well, you know how that one goes. The younger picks-- Modest Mouse, Julian Casablancas-- are safe. The older ones-- Graham Nash, John Doe-- aren't surprising or challenging, and aren't going to appeal to people who are there to hear the younger ones. It just feels like empty tribute, lip service for someone who really does deserve something more: the dignity of being left alone.</p></div>"|15588.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15588-rave-on-a-tribute-to-buddy-holly/|3.8|Mike Powell

Though both have since developed cultish followings by releasing distinctive takes on murky lo-fi, Maus has steeped his music in new wave signifiers, an association furthered by his deep, commanding voice. Whether he's evoking Joy Division's Ian Curtis or Bauhaus' Peter Murphy, Maus opts to abstract the genre, inserting noise into unexpected places and walking the line between sincerity and surreality.</p>
<p>From the beginning, he's been an artist fascinated by the parameters, paradoxes, and possibilities of pop. Earlier this year, Maus took a walk through New York's Central Park Zoo with a journalist from <i>Self-Titled</i>. ""I didn't realize that the music I was making was especially weird,"" he says in <a href=""http://www.self-titledmag.com/home/2011/07/01/test-pressing-stream-john-maus-new-lp-read-our-cover-story/#more-19706"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the piece</a>. ""Honestly, I thought I was making Top 40 kind of stuff. It wasn't until people kept telling me so that I realized my work was thought of as something 'other' than that."" If you're at all familiar with the Minnesota native's swampy retro-futurist synth-pop, you may understand why he might place emphasis on the word ""other."" One experience with his body of solo work (or brave live performances) makes clear that his could be categorized as ""outsider"" art, but it's difficult to say that without also seriously considering why. He makes thought-provoking music that's disguised as something else.</p>
<p><i>We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves</i>, his latest full-length, is the most vibrant and toothsome expression of Maus' pursuits yet. He keeps his vocals awash in gothic reverb and echo-driven effects, blurring the lines between what he's saying and emoting. Sometimes, as on ""Cop Killer"", a Jan Hammer-indebted number on which Maus sings over an iced bed of keys, the results are outlandish and oddly funny at the same time, in the way that certain scenes in David Lynch films can leap from chilling to comically exaggerated. (""Cop killer, let's kill the cops tonight/ Cop Killer, kill every cop in sight,"" he sings.) And then there's ""Matter of Fact"" immediately thereafter, a song whose staccato, orc-like chorus line is ""Pussy is not a matter of fact."" They're not the kind of earworms you want to find yourself singing aloud in public, but it might happen anyway.</p>
<p>Sonically, Maus works a minimal, primitive setup: sputtering drum machines and an arsenal of 1980s-vintage synth presets undercut his lyrics just as much as those exaggerated, often grotesque vocal turns do. Sometimes, these songs seem to exist solely to pose questions: Top 40 cheese or ironic cool? High-brow or low-brow? Honesty or posturing? Artifice or reality? But what makes <i>We Must Becom</i>e his finest full-length yet is how fluidly he communicates it all by foregrounding melody. On ""Keep Pushing On"", Maus' monastic, cellar-level singing lends the song the feel of a Gregorian chant-led exercise tape. Though the vocals and basslines on arpeggiated fever dream ""Quantum Leap"" mirror Joy Division's to an almost cartoonish degree, you still get a good sense of Maus' persona in the music. There's a genuine, almost maniacal sense of glee in the way he seems to approach each turn.</p>
<p>When Maus takes the stage, he plays with notions of performance by singing over his own backing tracks. He pogos, he screams, he runs-in-place and pulls his hair and spits and sweats and clenches up until he looks like he might burst through his button-down and chinos. It's hard to look away. Now Maus has a full set of songs whose architecture is just as sophisticated and riveting in actuality as it is in theory. While earlier records have been riddled by experiments gone awry (see: ""Rights for Gays"" and ""Tenebrae"", from 2007's <i>Love Is Real</i>), they also didn't feature the revolving parts and aerodynamic hooks of ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12179-believer/"">Believer</a>"", the closing track here and one that glitters from any angle. And although there's another vocalist at his side in the lullaby lilt of ""Hey Moon"" (songwriter <a href=""http://darkskiesassociation.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Molly Nilsson</a>, who wrote and performed the song on her 2008 album <i>These Things Take Time</i>), the way Maus sings to the heavens makes it sound as though he's no longer alone with his thoughts. Spend a lot of time with this record, and it's hard not to feel like you're right there with him.</p></div>"|15596.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15596-we-must-become-the-pitiless-censors-of-ourselves/|8.4|David Bevan

In the early years of the previous decade the Jamaican DJ possessed a nimble versatility that well matched dancehall's musical promiscuity, switching between slippery, smoke-damaged double-time raps and hypnotic sing-song choruses with an agility that for a time seemed unmatched. But at some point in the second half of the decade, Kartel may have begun to feel burdened by his own success, his regular status as Jamaica's number-one DJ also making him more vulnerable to demands that he represent the community rather than just its gun-wielding, girl-grabbing, ganja-imbibing contingent.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, on his most recent albums Kartel has dramatically switched up (or, rather, <i>down</i>) his flow, increasingly backgrounding his rapping in favor of a ponderous, Auto-Tune-damaged tenor moaning over deflated, synth-heavy arrangements, coming on like Mavado's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx_6i-sH4Zk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">On the Rock</a>""<i> </i>for a post<i>-808s &amp; Heartbreak </i>era. <i>Pon Di Gaza </i>in particular was so rigorously downbeat, grayscale, and bloody long that listening to the whole thing in one go felt like an absurd endurance test. But Kartel hasn't lost all contact with his erstwhile bad-boy self; on one-off tracks he still regularly comes as hard and fast as ever, and I suspect it's these more than recent albums that have protected his position at the top of dancehall's heap. Moreover, sometimes Kartel in downer mode can work fantastically. On the recent ""Coloring Book"", his oddly melancholy posturing captivates, as he boasts of his irresistibly tattooed skin over a gorgeously bittersweet concoction of piano chords and descending strings.</p>
<p>But ""Coloring Book"" doesn't grace Kartel's new album, <i>Kingston Story</i>, and there's precious little here that is nearly as enticing. It's as if Kartel has consciously rejected anything that's too dense, too wordy, too clearly casting him in the mold of DJ-as-rapper rather than universalist singjay. Which is a shame, because while <i>Kingston Story </i>is less exhaustingly morose than <i>Pon Di Gaza</i>, it's also more tepid, a conscientiously inoffensive collection both lyrically and sonically.</p>
<p>The thematic and stylistic range is established well enough on the first two tracks, the atmospheric and reflective ""Jamaica"" and the clattering dance-pop of ""Beautiful Girl"". If the becalmed stasis of the former signals Kartel's desire to transcend the role extroverted dancehall host, the latter just as clearly underscores the goal of seducing Western ears. This would all be well and good if these tunes were merely opening gambits on an album that struck a variety of poses, or at least continued to push these divergent directions into new territory. Instead they mark the outer limits of the venture, and while it's a compact album by dancehall standards <i>Kingston Story </i>starts to feel repetitive long before it winds down.</p>
<p>Subjected to the torments of Auto-Tune, Kartel's singing voice-- already somewhat weak and raspy, though that's hardly unusual for dancehall-- becomes a mournful, choked-up whimper, all the more incongruous for bleating out otherwise-upbeat protestations of sexual prowess. At times there's something compelling about this: On ""Breathless"", Kartel moans and whispers over a stark, beautiful arrangement of shimmering synths, ominous bass, and ghostly backing vocal effects, sorrowfully treading the sex/death tightrope where the flush of desire coincides with chilling presentiments of mortality. But for the most part <i>Kingston Story </i>is neither powerful nor distinctive enough for this sense of vulnerability to have much purchase.</p>
<p>Such timidity is particularly disappointing because it coincides with the most enthusiastic upswing in dancehall's embrace of the weird and the wired in nearly a decade. Dancehall's new trends need Kartel, who's always had the gravitas to keep his head and his flow even in the most arcane settings. He'd do well to rediscover his insouciance for a while.</p></div>"|15615.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15615-kingston-story/|5.7|Tim Finney

The label has also released work by its co-owners: David Kennedy (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15229-fabriclive-56/"">Pearson Sound/ Ramadanman</a>), Kevin McAuley (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28648-pangaea/"" target=""_blank"">Pangaea</a>), and Ben Thomson (Ben UFO). If fellow UK imprint <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/labels/2945-hotflush/"" target=""_blank"">Hotflush</a> explores the breadth of bass sounds in electronic music, Hessle explores their depth, stitching the concept of sternum-shaking low-end into the fibers of their style.</p>
<p>This approach has led to a rupturing interpretation of dubstep and techno that often concedes beauty or charm but has not precluded curiosity or exploration. The label hosted what is arguably Blake's most progressive work (<i>The Bells Sketch</i> EP), and Kennedy has also been instrumental in electronic music's adoption of the footwork sound (an influence that pervades Addison Groove's ""Fuk tha 101"" and Pearson Sound's ""Stifle"" here). <i>116 &amp; Rising</i>, Hessle's first full-length release, offers one disc of classic label cuts and one disc of new material.</p>
<p>The label's tendency to sequester itself in 12""s, as well as its notoriously stingy release schedule, makes the retrospective portion particularly valuable. Presented at dance-friendly tempos, these 12 tracks are split among only seven producers, forfeiting range for tense, agile deployment. The tracks are not about establishing a mood; they concern themselves first with bass and second with the ways rhythm can aid, embellish, circle, and attack that bass. Blawan, the label's most exciting young product, enacts this most clearly on ""Fram"", which is the sound of a Transformer continually unfolding: exponentially mechanistic, ugly but undeniably neat.</p>
<p>The disc of new materials suffers both in comparison to the classic material and from a frantic energy never properly corralled. Still, there is plenty to digest: Untold takes his Duplo-block chords and applies them to Chicago house on ""Cool Story Bro"". Addison Groove's ""Fuk tha 101"" proves the artist also known as Headhunter has plans for the footwork sound grander than the indelible ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWfiog1Ure4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Footcrab</a>"". Pangaea continues an uninterrupted run of excellent singles with ""Runout"", a tart, acidic current of noise. (A ""Second Version"" of Blake's ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15763-give-a-man-a-rod-second-version/"" target=""_blank"">Give a Man a Rod</a>"" feels sadly like an attempt to include a ""New James Blake track!"")</p>
<p><i>116 &amp; Rising</i> offers a clearer vision of where Hessle has been than where it's going. It's OK to care less about such visions and more about a collection of kickass tracks (of which <i>116</i> offers many), though Hessle's cautious nature suggests that coherence matters. That the new disc includes some producers-- D1, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22787-peverelist/"" target=""_blank"">Peverelist</a>, Randomer-- that the label considers kin indicates that the close-knit, communal aspect of Hessle isn't going away. At a bare minimum, <i>116</i> provides a third totem (after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13614-5-five-years-of-hyperdub/"" target=""_blank"">Hyperdub's <i>5</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15396-back-and-4th/"" target=""_blank"">Hotflush's <i>Back and 4th</i></a>) for anyone requiring a quick primer on the last half-decade of progressive bass music. It is a tech-y, aggressive totem, but don't conflate that aggression and lack of expanse with a dearth of creativity.</p></div>"|15612.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15612-116-rising/|7.2|Andrew Gaerig

She's made four albums and two split releases in that time-- all interesting forays into noise, drone, and ambience. But <i>Glacial Glow </i>is a leap forward. Confident and consistent, it bears a musical personality that had been somewhat hidden. Previous Noveller records could drift into vagueness, but here Lipstate gives each track a distinct theme, telling a series of wordless stories. Her sounds are more like syllables and sentences than abstract textures. That makes <i>Glacial Glow </i>her most melodic album, but that's not why it's her best. The increased accessibility is simply a byproduct of finding a stronger, bolder voice.</p>
<p>It's also a byproduct of her focusing more on her guitar than the effects pedals she attaches to it. Notes and chords take center stage, where once they could get blurred in echo. There's still lots of atmosphere here, but the causes of that effect-- the basic act of plucking a string or strumming a chord-- assume prominence. <a href=""http://www.jconline.com/article/20110619/ENT/106190318/Guitarist-Noveller-builds-relationship-instrument"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">According</a> to Lipstate, these songs began with her playing guitar unamplified in bed, and the simplicity and intimacy of that approach comes through in the end results. The distance between initial idea and what we hear feels short. Each track has a patient, searching quality, as if she's discovering sounds with us, never rushing through them or piling them up.</p>
<p>In that sense, Lipstate reminds me of that singular model of patience, Loren Connors. Her sound is certainly busier than his, but you can hear Connors' painterly fortitude on ""Alone Star"", a kind of frozen Western theme in which bassy plucks tremble in the moonlight and high-end curls sparkle in the distance. Other artists echo here as well-- I hear a little Sonic Youth in the loops of ""Waxwing"", a little Papa M in the pastoral strings of ""Tuesday Before Poland"", a little of Explosions in the Sky's cinematic drama in the lilting ""Glacial Wave"". But often when an artist gets stronger, the music becomes more universal, and reference points become easier to hear. It may sound paradoxical, but these evocations help make <i>Glacial Glow </i>distinct.</p>
<p>What most distinguishes the album is Lipstate's boldness. Every song steps forward even as it envelops, and most have short titles that eschew irony or indecision. Take the closer, which is bluntly titled <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odhV1gQ3q2Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ends""</a> because that's what it does, with gentle tones slowly disappearing into the horizon. If you're familiar with Lipstate, you might notice I've gotten this far without mentioning her <a href=""http://sarahlipstate.com/wordpress/index.php/bio/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">many</a> other projects and collaborations, which come up in most reviews and articles about her. Those are interesting too, but they're irrelevant to <i>Glacial Glow</i>, a work in which she's fully earned the right to be considered completely on her own.</p></div>"|15620.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15620-glacial-glow/|7.6|Marc Masters

They sang in all the usual places-- the park, street corners, walking home from school. After adding a fourth member, they got good enough to start playing parties and talent shows. Even as they got gigs, they still didn't have a name until one was given to them when they backed a local soul singer. They became the Dreams. In the late 60s and early 70s, a lot of predominantly black neighborhoods had community centers working hard to get kids off the streets, and Adams Morgan had the People's Center, founded in 1972 by Norman Hylton. The group found itself frequenting the Center, and it was here that it was suggested that they add instrumentalists and become a self-contained band in the Earth, Wind &amp; Fire vein.</p>
<p>The singers recruited a band and took up instruments themselves, quickly developing into a tight, flexible unit with a strong original repertoire, much of it written by keyboardist/vocalist Nick Smith. It was a chance event that put the final piece in place, though: the band emerged unharmed from a rollover van accident while touring Virginia. They changed their name to the more hip and current Father's Children, and most of them converted to a form of Islam. Late in the year, the band entered the studio to make its first album. A few personnel changes, tours to Texas and Bermuda, and some sessions that lasted into 1973 later, they had it.</p>
<p>But it never was released. The band couldn't get a record deal as its management company folded, and producer Robert Hosea Williams, who didn't get paid for his work, put the tapes in his garage, where they remained until now. Numero Group has dusted them off and finally put together <i>Who's Gonna Save the World</i>, the lost debut of Father's Children. The album reflects the five-month period over which it was recorded quite well, presenting the band as skilled in funky social commentary, string-soaked love songs, Santana-esque jams, psychedelic post-hippie mysticism, sweet harmony soul and artsy fusion.</p>
<p>Some of these songs are truly great. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X6B0_xd8Mg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dirt and Grime</a>"", a harmony-soaked rumination on the run-down state of the group's neighborhood, erupts with nasty fuzz-toned guitar that seems encrusted with all the filth implied in the title. On ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff5ESVUvdCY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kohoutek</a>"", named for a bright comet that appeared in the night sky in early 1973, the flexibility of the band's spiritual, religious, and mystical beliefs is readily apparent as the horn arrangement and whispers of the title give way to spoken lyrics about the body being a prison for the soul. ""In Shallah"", a gorgeously swaying harmony number, is titled as though it has openly Muslim themes (that's Arabic for ""God Willing""), but it really doesn't-- it's more of a sweet soul tune with spiritual overtones.</p>
<p>There are bits that haven't dated well-- the muddled spoken conclusion of ""Everybody's Got a Problem"" is one, with members speaking such profundities as ""war's a drag, man""-- but overall it's a cool album that probably could have done well had it been promptly released. It captures the zeitgeist of its age as well as anything by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, with not much less commercial appeal. Father's Children endured through the end of the 70s, ultimately releasing a self-titled LP recorded in Hollywood for Mercury Records in 1979, and another after briefly reuniting in 2005. Neither of those went anywhere, and while this release can't quite correct history, it does finally bring to light a good would-be debut by a worthy band that just never caught its break.</p></div>"|15619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15619-whos-gonna-save-the-world/|7.4|Joe Tangari

It's understandable since Dayve Hawk's prior gig Hail Social released a couple of LPs of timely, danceable indie rock while perpetually hemmed in between positive notice (<i>SPIN</i> Band of the Day, a deal with Polyvinyl) and a legitimate breakthrough. I can't imagine being too enthusiastic for the obligations of the traditional album cycle after all of that. Hawk's subsequent release of singles, remixes, and other one-offs under a clutch of confusingly similar names (<a href=""http://weirdtapes.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Memory Tapes</a>, Weird Tapes, Memory Cassette) announced his newfound artistic direction as a cry of freedom, and he didn't show much interest in performing live either. But more eyes are on him than ever for <i>Player Piano</i>, and he's still got a thing for demurral. He's already claimed his third record to be almost done, allegedly a collection of Black Sabbath-influenced dirges. You would think such diffuse focus would eventually catch up with him, yet <i>Player Piano</i> finds him more concentrated and economical than ever. Unfortunately, it comes off more like complacency than conviction, that Hawk's either holding back on us, misreading his true strengths, not recognizing the need to rise to the occasion, or possibly all three.</p>
<p>While the individual songs on <i>Seek Magic</i> were excellent themselves, what made that record stand out was its comprehensiveness. Whether you enjoyed Hawk's laconic and fuzzy melodies, gelatinous electronic textures, or pulsating dance music, you weren't too far from any of those at a given time (and you could find them all on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11320-bicycle/"" target=""_blank"">Bicycle</a>""). <i>Player Piano</i> lacks that crucial cumulative effect, and instead Hawk presents himself more as an able if indistinct singer-songwriter than a molder of pure sound. And it isn't any sort of reactionary statement against chillwave: He stood out in my mind as the most forthright vocalist of his peers to begin with, his feminized coo relying more on elegant melodic curvature than foggy evocation.</p>
<p>He gets a proper showcase with single ""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/Memory%20Tapes%20-%20Wait%20In%20The%20Dark.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Wait in the Dark</a>"", on which Hawk is a true frontman rather than a texture over a streamlined arrangement. This shift makes Memory Tapes successfully come off like a sleek rock band than a home-bound project. Though he's comfortable doing true pop music, as opposed to pop determined by immediate context, his more extroverted moments can be as cloying: ""Sunhits"" rousts <i>Player Piano</i> from a mid-record plateau, but the overly chipper guitar doodles and Hawk's dodgiest and most clearly enunciated hook (""Nothing's a dream if you never wake up""-- he's never been a lyrics guy) strain too hard to fulfill the prophecy of its title. And how ""Today Is Our Life"" hits me depends almost entirely on my current mood: There are times when I find it to be a genuinely buoyant tambourine-shaking shimmy of breathless hooks; there are others where that cornpone guitar solo and sitar-laced coda are the stuff of shopping mall karaoke booths.</p>
<p>It cuts to what's really troubling about <i>Player Piano</i>, how such a committed studio geek like Hawk delves into production-intensive 60s sunshine pop and ends up with such a weirdly distracting 2-D sound that leaves it sounding unfinished, demo-level, even. Its mood lighting is similar to that of <i>Seek Magic</i>, but the underlying instrumentation is often flat and airless, sucked dry of his typically evocative detailing. Paradoxically, the tracks that are proudly sample-free and reliant on acoustic instrumentation are the ones that are the least dynamic and eerily evoke the disembodied artificial intelligence of keyboard presets. ""Yes I Know"" submerges its carnivalesque pinwheels and Hawk's vocals in a waterlogged muffle that you expect to lift at some point, but it goes relatively hi-fi still without coming up for air. The same goes for ""Offers"" and ""Worries"", nice enough experiments in bubblegum funk and digitally retouched <i>Nuggets</i> Farfisa-rock that lack any sort of immersion or fluidity. And the instrumentals no longer feel like they're on equal footing, not that they do much to make themselves noticed. ""Humming"" is a palate cleanser of skittering drum machines and languid atmosphere begging for a longer work to play a part in, and while the first half of ""Fell Thru Ice"" finds Hawk exploring newly unmoored song structure, Part II is simply a lesser replay of <i>Seek Magic</i> tricks. It gets chased with ""Trance Sisters"", which deserves some credit as a buzzer-beating freak-out of maximalism, even if it's basically a compressed version of ""Bicycle"".</p>
<p>All of which makes <i>Player Piano</i> a curiosity more than a flop. In fact, the sturdy hooks and thin arrangements make it ripe for remixes, and considering the similar wavelength he was on with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10559-andorra/"" target=""_blank""><i>Andorra</i></a>, I wonder what Dan Snaith might be able to do with the raw materials here. But while I'd love to say Hawk's ear for melody or texture is what differentiates <i>Player Piano</i> from the dozens of agreeable but wholly unremarkable electro-pop records that get a pass, truth is, it's ultimately the comparison to <i>Seek Magic</i> that makes it such a letdown.</p></div>"|15582.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15582-player-piano/|6.0|Ian Cohen

Up until now we knew him mostly for some high-profile remixes and his original, instrumental tracks, which were solid but nothing to flip out over. He was loosely dubstep in the way, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28145-floating-points/"" target=""_blank"">Floating Points</a> is, using the genre as a rough guide but also weaving in several other strains of contemporary bass music. But with this self-titled LP, SBTRKT is something different: Recruiting guest vocalists to sing over his arrangements, he's working more as a traditional producer, and his music, while still grounded in experimental bass, is inching much closer toward pop.</p>
<p>You might call what SBTRKT is doing here ""post-dubstep"". That's not a totally accurate term (for one, he's building off more than just that one genre), but his approach is certainly similar to what guys like James Blake and Jamie Woon have been up to in the last year or so. The central differences here are that a) SBTRKT doesn't sing himself (he's brought in vocalists Sampha, Jessie Ware, Roses Gabor, and Little Dragon's Yukimi Nagano for that); and b) his music is more immediate than both Blake's and Woon's. Rather than go for showy, scene-stealing productions, he keeps things tight and purposeful: The focus is on the overall song and the vocal, and beats are just one part of that equation.</p>
<p>The record pits some emotive and occasionally downcast singing against arrangements that throb nicely, and there's a good sense of balance and variety throughout. First single ""Wildfire"", for example, is a squelchy, Timbaland-like pop moment, where ""Trials of the Past"" is spooky and slower-paced. The reason the tracks work individually and as a whole is that SBTRKT has a keen sense of how to draw the most out of his guest vocalists. UK singer Sampha, who is featured heavily on the LP, has a warm, higher-range croon that seems built for R&amp;B, and SBTRKT arranges accordingly, giving him stuttery tracks that draw from American urban pop and smoothed-out drum'n'bass.</p>
<p>Importantly this makes the album greater than the sum of its parts. ""Dubstep dude with a bunch of singers"" becomes something much more collaborative and cohesive. SBTRKT is ultimately a colorful and highly enjoyable future-pop record, an extension of bass culture but not indebted to it. The other crucial thing is that the album is actually quite accessible, which is something that's eluded similar post-bass projects. Those other guys-- Blake, Woon-- might have a purer artistic vision, but of the three, SBTRKT has arguably assembled the broadest and most listenable collection of songs. And in a field where approachability isn't always given a ton of weight, it feels brave to take this more song-oriented path and pull it off.</p></div>"|15607.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15607-sbtrkt/|8.1|Joe Colly

Their twisting, roiling blare had elements of pounding industrial, of mouth-foaming hardcore punk, of brutally fast hardcore rave, of scraping electronic noise, of thrash-metal bombast, of wriggling drill-n-bass, of Bomb Squad-style attack-beats. Their specific chaotic combination added up to German-accented ridiculousness (""<span class=""misspell"">Deutschland</span>! Has gotta! <i><span class=""misspell"">Diiieeee</span></i>!"") screamed over <span class=""misspell"">hyperspeed</span> 808 pounds and digitally treated guitar fuzz; it seemed scientifically engineered to annoy as many people as possible. It was impossible to dance or talk or read or drive or do <i>anything else</i> while they were playing. I tried <i>so hard</i> to like them, and I mostly succeeded, even though my friends would give me tons of shit anytime I played their records.</p>
<p>For a brief moment in the mid-1990s, the group seemed like the future. They released records on Grand Royal, they opened the much-touted Rage Against the <span class=""misspell"">Machine</span>/Wu-Tang Clan tour, and they spearheaded their own little mini-scene with their Digital Hardcore label. But after 11 years of inactivity, it's pretty clear that they didn't exactly change the conversation. You can detect pieces of their style in a few musical movements that have come along since: the Teutonic-accented <span class=""misspell"">confrontationalism</span> of <span class=""misspell"">electroclash</span>, the low-budget rabble-rousing computer-pop of early M.I.A., the squealing <span class=""misspell"">brickwalled</span> dance-metal of Justice. But Atari Teenage Riot didn't transcend their moment. So their new album, <i>Is This <span class=""misspell"">Hyperreal</span>?</i>, is a curious thing indeed: a nostalgic work that evokes an idea of the future that turned out to be absurd. Listening to it is like watching a remake of <i>Johnny Mnemonic</i>.</p>
<p>The reconstituted Atari Teenage Riot of 2011 isn't really the same group from that mid-90s moment. Unhinged <span class=""misspell"">hypeman</span> Carl Crack died in 2001. Lead screamer Hanin Elias is long gone, though replacement <span class=""misspell"">Nic</span> <span class=""misspell"">Endo</span> sounds almost <i>exactly</i> like her. There's also a new member: laughably clumsy American MC <span class=""misspell"">CX</span> <span class=""misspell"">Kidtronik (s</span>ample lyrics: ""My fist! My fist! I bang my fist! Against a concrete wall!""). But even with a ton of membership turnover, Atari Teenage Riot sound very, very similar to what mastermind Alec Empire first unleashed a decade and a half ago. Then again, it's not like those early records left a whole lot of room for aesthetic advancement (what, were they going to find a new genre of noisy assault music to incorporate?). But it's still pretty weird that this band's overwhelming fury has not mellowed in the slightest since they've been away. They're not teenagers anymore, but you'd never know it from listening to them.</p>
<p>That's not exactly a compliment. Teenagers experience politics in absolutes; red-faced sloganeering makes a lot more sense to a human ball of hormones than nuanced discourse ever could. But when a grown man roars, ""They want to turn the <span class=""misspell"">Internet</span> into their personal global chessboard!"" it just sounds goofy (who's <i>they</i>?). Some of the lyrics on <i>Is This <span class=""misspell"">Hyperreal</span>?</i> push those tendencies to dizzy extremes. Consider, for example, this: ""Capitalism, you're a little fat man in a big expensive car hanging over a ravine here!"" Or this bit of anti-<span class=""misspell"">Internet</span> agitprop: ""When the authorities catch up with us, <i>and they will</i>, it's not such a good idea to leave traces and expose your whole network at once!"" (Yes, Atari Teenage Riot have their own iPhone app. Why do you ask?) Musically, too, it's the same <span class=""misspell"">hyperspeed</span> noise-blast format they've been working forever, beyond the odd moment of Crystal Castles-style mutated video-game bloop. When ""Shadow Identity"" turns into deeply pretty M83-<span class=""misspell"">ish</span> epic <span class=""misspell"">synthpop</span> for a minute, it's a legit shock: This band learned a new trick! But it's just for a few seconds at the end of the song, and then it's over.</p>
<p>Redundant as it may be, though, <i>Is This <span class=""misspell"">Hyperreal</span>?</i> succeeds simply as unintentional nostalgia, at least for someone who experienced the band the first time around. Opening track ""Activate!"", for instance, is pretty much Crystal Method-style big beat, but with more guitar fuzz and screaming, and it's just <i>fun</i>. The fact that Atari Teenage Riot still exist in any form, and that they're still making these sputtering tantrums, is almost admirable. They're gloriously silly anachronisms, and I'm not sorry to have them back in my life. My friends probably aren't too happy, though.</p></div>"|15610.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15610-is-this-hyperreal/|5.1|Tom Breihan

It's like building sculptures out of thrift-store finds and junkyard debris, so naturally some of his collages can sound nostalgic. But associating Copeland with anyone besides himself or his group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"" target=""_blank"">Black Dice</a> feels wrong. He really inhabits his own universe, one he started before current cut-ups took to scouring VHS tapes and video games for source material. And his fractured rhythms, which can approach bouncy hip-hop loops, are as close to the Bomb Squad or J Dilla as Washed Out or Ducktails.</p>
<p>In fact, where those latter artists often deal in blurry memories of decades past, Copeland's music reminds me more of a specific 1980s moment-- the scene in <i>Ferris Bueller</i>'s <i>Day Off</i> where Matthew Broderick's character plays ""Blue Danube"" on a keyboard programmed with coughs and wheezes. Back then, the thrill of using synths and samplers came in making any sound into a note, and making any string of noises into a song. Copeland still seems fascinated by that simple idea and the unlimited potential it implies. On <i>Waco Taco Combo</i>, his latest LP, that fascination results in some of his catchiest songs to date.</p>
<p>What makes them so catchy is also what makes them simple-- hard, straight-ahead beats. Which is not to say that any song here is straightforward. They all creak and groan with lopsided motion. Drops of noisy oil leak out and loose screws rattle as Copeland's musical jalopy sidles down the street. But each track eventually digs into a bumping groove, which becomes glue that holds all the rickety parts together, or a magnet around which Copeland's furry filaments align into body-moving tuneage. It's a pretty singular pleasure to nod your head to such cartoonish music-- it's as if Copeland stole Wile E. Coyote's ACME bomb kit, and turned the explosions into beats.</p>
<p>On side two of <i>Waco Taco Combo</i>, all the string and tape that Copeland uses to hold his sounds together finally snaps, and a bunch of sonic detritus comes spilling out. In one side-long track, ""<a href=""http://soundcloud.com/alteredzones/eric-copeland-spangled/s-oS8Q5"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spangled</a>"", Copeland's beats become more random and less fluid, his scenes fused via random jump cuts rather than smooth dissolves. Some might see ""Spangled"" as a doggie bag, filled with leftovers whose connections are hard to see. How appetizing you'll find this stew depends on your tolerance for collage as an end in itself. To me, it's a nice contrast to the album's smoother songs. But even if you can't stomach all 17 minutes, there's more than enough nuggets on <i>Waco Taco Combo</i> to sink your teeth into.</p></div>"|15616.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15616-waco-taco-combo/|7.5|Marc Masters

The duo's members, Vast Aire and Vordul Mega, had something to prove. Definitive Jux label head El-P, who produced the album, was fired up to define himself post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8777-company-flow/"">Company Flow</a>. And underground hip-hop was at the perfect point to accept a new vanguard for post-Wu-Tang spiritual headknock. But bridges have been burned, beefs over business have gone down, and all the players have been left to their own devices. The more time that passes, the easier it is to wonder how well the sum  of CanOx's parts could survive independently of each other.</p>
<p>For a while after the release of 2008's <i>Dueces Wild</i>, it looked like Vast Aire was finally starting to shift the conversation from ""when's the next CanOx album?"" to ""when's the next Vast album?"" But any feeling of momentum from that release has vanished on <i>OX 2010: A Street Odyssey</i>. It takes 35 seconds for the space-age triumphalism of ""Nomad"" to get to this cornball lyric: ""And even though I do yoga/ Trust me, Vast Aire has never been a poseur."" Over a beat evoking some sort of futurist celestial majesty, that head-slapper of a punchline is only the first of several moments where it feels like Vast is stuck somewhere between badass and goofball. In splltting the difference, he just sounds stilted.</p>
<p>Other verses tread a similar line. ""My dad is a Magnum/ I'm a son of a gun,"" Vast jokes on ""2090 (So Grimmy)"". The wicked-carnival scenario of ""Merry Go Round"" has just the minimum amount of dignity to keep it from seeming like a bid for Juggalo crossover fandom. And the goopy wuv-rap of ""Horoscope"" is way too treacly from someone who once poured his heart out on <i>The Cold Vein</i>'s devastatingly sincere ""The F-Word"". The most cringeworthy moment comes in closer ""Battle of the Planets"", where Vast actually recycles the refrain from ""Scream Phoenix"", turning <i>The Cold Vein</i>'s most life-affirming moment into a grudge taunt at the expense of former Weathermen crewmate Cage. His deliberate, heavily enunciated growl underlines every embarrassing lyrical decision in red pen.</p>
<p>At least <i>OX 2010</i> doesn't feel entirely like one MC stranded in his own malaise. The beats are serviceable, with some unostentatious boom-bap from the likes of Kount Fif, Harry Fraud, and Ayatollah. And the guest verses range from complementary mediocrity (Cappadonna treading water on ""I Don't Care"") to complete upstagings (Guilty Simpson going berserk on ""The Verdict""). Unfortunately, the album's most headline-grabbing collaboration-- a brief reunion with Vordul on ""Thor's Hammer"", with a re-used Raekwon verse from <i>Blood on Chef's Apron </i>taking the first slot-- is also its biggest disappointment. There are plenty of ways to get people to stop clamoring for a Cannibal Ox reunion. This album's the saddest one.</p></div>"|15609.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15609-ox-2010-a-street-odyssey/|4.6|Nate Patrin

After a long period of complete disappearance, Cam's been going through something of a comeback lately, aided in large part by tracks like Araab's punishing ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epP7i7unWdU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Get It in Ohio</a>"". Araab's work for Cam, and for other freelance clients, sounds dollar-store cheap but knife-edge tense; it reminds me of Steve Jablonsky's score for <i>Friday the 13th</i>. He makes ferocious, diamond-hard gangsta rap beats with a pervading sense of dystopic anxiety. Araab's sense of vision comes through even more strongly in the web videos he's been releasing, in which he <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXRnbS6o64U&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shows off his MPC virtuosity</a> and slices up samples of, oh, say, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82AKTZeMR3k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cannibal Corpse</a>. Like fellow underground rap visionaries <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"">Clams Casino</a> and DJ Burn One, Araab makes freelance beats that hint at a fully developed personal aesthetic. And like those guys, he's now striking out on his own, making instrumental music that brings that aesthetic to the forefront.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Electronic Dream</i> is Araab's first commercially available album, but it works more like a collection of remixes. Rather than creating his own tracks from scratch, Araab spends his debut album dismembering a series of cheesed-out hairgel-house superclub anthems: DJ Nosferatu's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxAZvroAWps"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Underground Stream</a>"" on ""Underground Stream"", Jam &amp; Spoon's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y7MgeHg0C8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Right in the Night (Fall in Love With Music)</a>"" on ""Golden Touch"", Starchaser's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1-SUXCPahc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">So High</a>"" on ""Feelin So Hood"". This is, to put it mildly, an unexpected direction for Araab. With a little bit of Googling, you can find plenty of online screeds from fans frustrated or even enraged at Araab for making an album based on this music, or for dishonoring his sample sources by leaving large pieces of these tracks unchanged while neglecting to properly credit the original producers. But Araab's changes, relatively minor though they may be, turn a sound built on populist uplift into something darker.</p>
<p>It's tough to imagine the tracks on<i> Electronic Dream</i> getting any play in any dance club in the world, and it's virtually impossible to picture anyone rapping over them. Instead, this album is a genre unto itself-- ominous future shit that creates an atmosphere but never bleeds into the background. Araab's snare-hits resonate like eye-punches, and his drum-programming is pure, unrelenting rap shit. But he's applying that sensibility to songs where the melodies shine even when Araab's using a screaming sound effect as part of the rhythm track. The end result is a truly weird little album-- something at once anxious and euphoric.</p>
<p>As hard as his drums punch, though, Araab still let the textures of these anthems shine through. And in Araab's hands, these melodies work differently; the anonymous dance divas wailing ecstatically over their original beats become lost, lonely souls, anxiously whispering to themselves that everything will be OK. Araab's music doesn't allow for dizzy buildups and cathartic breakdowns; instead, it's all murky tension, all the time. At times, his tracks can sound a bit like the woozy bass music of L.A.'s Brainfeeder scene, but Araab is always more direct and more ferocious than those guys. And yet the sugary beauty of those melodies sound like they belong on his tracks; nothing is out of place. ""Got a feelin' so high,"" the singer on ""Feelin So Hood"" coos, and the drums beat that feeling down while the gorgeous ripples of synth lift it back up.</p>
<p>There's something truly fascinating about the entire LP: An up-and-coming hardcore rap producer leaving his genre behind so that he can twist and scramble this hands-in-the-air big-room sound. And in peeling back its excesses and substituting in his own eccentricities, Araab uncovers a primal emotional force in this music, one that fits beautifully with his own air-raid siren aesthetic. <i>Electronic Dream</i> is pretty, but it's pretty like the morning sun twinkling off of a dangling machete blade-- you don't want to fuck with it.</p></div>"|15566.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15566-electronic-dream/|8.2|Tom Breihan

For those of us who heard something special in loose, wandering tracks like 2009 B-side ""<a href=""http://www.vimeo.com/groups/1555/videos/23073629"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You're in It Now</a>"" or ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnZuDiF1w8I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Voices</a>"" a year later, nearly everything on<i> Pleasure</i> will feel like a welcome distillation of the elements that made those songs sound promising. In turn, the band's new moniker should seem completely fitting: No longer just a kick-around project from three Austin dudes, Pure X have become the refined and elemental version of their former selves.</p>
<p>Fans of those early singles don't need to worry too much. Pure X remain very much attached to their singular style. Jesse Jenkins' bass still sounds peanut-butter sticky, while Nate Grace's guitars showcase pond-ripple textures and Mideast-tinged tones one moment and hemorrhage syrupy feedback the next. Like grunge for beachcombers or shoegaze for people happy to be alive,<i> Pleasure </i>is all about texture and patience, stretched to ensure maximum zoneage. Anything MDMA-related about the moniker is a total misnomer-- this sounds like music made by people who mainline Benadryl.</p>
<p>Sure, the album's blown-out guitars, dusky shoreline vibes, and drug-sick crawl can seem awfully familiar. But Pure X aren't just coasting on shaggy fumes. For one, this is a terrific-<i>sounding</i> record, built for headphones and high volume. Recorded live with no overdubs, everything emulsifies beatifically while a disorienting quality still looms, like riding in a four-door on the freeway with only the back left window down.</p>
<p>Pure X also set themselves apart by both honoring their influences and recombining them in interesting ways. Opener ""Heavy Air"" sounds like a chopped 'n' screwed Real Estate, while the new version of ""Voices"" suggests My Bloody Valentine channeling the Everly Brothers. After all, these songs owe a lot to the starry-eyed romantic ballads of the late 1950s and early 60s. Instead of harnessing the rebel cool of that era, Pure X get lost in the simplicity and slow-burn daydreaminess, stoking these characteristics with uniquely visceral reverb and a zonked tunefulness that impart a vaporous sensuality.</p>
<p>But the most defining and pleasurable thing about <i>Pleasure</i> is the guitars-- impressive for a record that doesn't care about show-off guitar shit <i>at all</i>. Grace lets his pedals do most of the talking, gracefully sussing out emotional detail with subtle melody while still creating memorable moments, like the cheap firework burnout at the end of ""Half Here"". Pure X may not be breaking new ground, but as far as deadbeat summer vibes done right go, <i>Pleasure</i> is one killer drag.</p></div>"|15575.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15575-pleasure/|7.6|Zach Kelly

Music imprint takes a similar approach. The idea seems to be that with a deal and a record in stores, the Detroit MC has earned the right to complain with the best of them.</p>
<p>While <i>Finally Famous</i> isn't especially nuanced, Sean is an often extremely entertaining rapper. He's able to fit his elastic, smooth voice in the cracks of No I.D.'s lush soul samples just as easily as he slides right over heavier, more radio-friendly tracks like ""Marvin &amp; Chardonnay"", which features a verse from West. Sean often runs circles around beats, speeding up his voice so that his words cram into a pileup in the end. His appeal is more in the way he plays with language than in his lyrics, which go so far as to make an unfortunate ""Family Guy"" reference.</p>
<p>On individual tracks, Sean's style works well. Even the blandest lyrics are worth a rewind based purely on delivery and enthusiasm. Who knew that ""Fuck, I hate to say I told you so/ So buying rounds is my way of saying I told you hos"" could sound so believably triumphant? But it's when the guests show up-- a high-profile list including not only West, but also The-Dream, Lupe Fiasco, Pharrell, John Legend, Wiz Khalifa, and Chris Brown-- Sean appears out of place on his own album. Clipse's Pusha T has a particularly strong verse on deluxe-edition album closer ""100 Keys"", while Sean sounds helium-light by comparison.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Sean's a likable character. Still, a line on ""100 Keys"" encapsulates his faults: ""Keys open doors, but bricks open windows,"" he raps, recalling Clipse's ""Keys Open Doors"" except lacking their sharp wit and heavy delivery. We can only hope that for album two, Sean will step out from the herculean shadows of the artists he surrounds himself with and learn the art of subtlety.</p></div>"|15605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15605-finally-famous/|6.1|Sam Hockley-Smith

At press time, an end appears nowhere in sight. Along their way, the band carved out a little time to lay down their latest, <i>Stranger Ballet</i>. Half as long and nearly twice as lively as its predecessor, <i>Stranger Ballet</i> is bright, boisterous, and instantly appealing power-pop, jammed with the kind of immediacy you hope to put across when you've only got a half-hour or so to impress and the sort of smart, starchy hooks that hang with you long after they're over.</p>
<p>Each member of the band's songwriting trio ups his own lyrical ante on <i>Stranger Ballet</i>. Patrick Tape Fleming's words are more charmingly sincere, fellow guitarist Devin Frank's are slacker and more impressionistic, and bassist Joseph Terry's are both sweeter and more surreal. Musically, though, their styles have grown far closer, perhaps a byproduct of all those months on the road flitting through the van iPod. Hints of spindly alt-rock touchstones from Built to Spill to pre-<i>Maladroit</i> Weezer bump heads with glam and late-90s indie spazz, but with much of <i>Sad Sour Future</i>'s excess fat trimmed back, <i>who</i> PCC sound like seems far less important this time out than <i>what</i> they sound like. <span>Here's a band that's enjoyed an enormous confidence boost over the past couple of years, and while there's still a kind of aw-shucks humility to the proceedings, the giddy effortlessness of these hooks suggest that these guys know precisely how good they've gotten.</span></p>
<p>As on <i>Sad Sour Future</i>, there's nary a bad tune in the bunch, but I'll call Terry's gleefully manic ""Underground Bed"" the set's highest high-- like a Thermals song with the vitriol sucked right out. That's the other thing about these guys: Except for maybe Frank's sad sour missive about ""shit and piss"" on opener ""Torpedoes on Tuesday..."" and Fleming's weepy ""Born on Date"", there's never a second where the band's not having a blast making this racket. You can hear the smiles wide across their faces, and that feeling's catching. Even when soul belter Mona Perkins does an awkwardly ebullient ""Gimme  Shelter"" routine on a couple of these tracks, the ill-suited pairing  gets over on sheer jubilance. Nearly a decade deep into their career, you couldn't blame these guys for coming off a little ragged, especially after the exceedingly ambitious <i>Sad Sour Future</i>. But <i>Stranger Ballet</i> finds the PCC raring to go, eager to please, and enjoying every minute of the wild ride they've found themselves on.</p></div>"|15608.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15608-stranger-ballet/|7.6|Paul Thompson

But those two aesthetic poles blurred into one upon hearing the striking debut single from <a href=""http://www.gardensandvilla.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gardens &amp; Villa</a>. Ideal for summertime strolls through a cemetery, ""<a href=""http://www.scjag.com/mp3/sc/blackhills.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black Hills</a>"" pits vibraphone chimes against an icy synth pulse overtop an unnervingly steady beat. And while ""Black Hills"" presents magisterial images of mountains, seas, and high tides, its environment feels tensely claustrophobic, with Chris Lynch's elastic, androgynous voice projecting serenity and severity in equal measure. It's the sort of song you could easily imagine Beach House coming up with, were they to follow-up the lushness of <i>Teen Dream</i> with something more sinister.</p>
<p>But the self-titled debut album that ""Black Hills"" opens shows Gardens &amp; Villa to be something more complex than just a Beach Hearse. That such a moody outfit hails from sunny Santa Barbara is but a surface indication of their curious qualities. With a lyric sheet that's preoccupied with nature and mysticism-- not to mention a singer who's not afraid to whip out a flute-- Gardens &amp; Villa could easily be pegged as hippies. But they're also keen on playing up the artificial qualities of their music, foregrounding synthesizers and mechanized, metronomic rhythms to create a peculiar hybrid of 1960s and 80s sensibilities. (One song bears the particularly apt title of ""Neon Dove"".) As such, the austerity of their sound can make them seem both sternly serious and, at times, rather goofy. (See: the ping-ponged synth-pop of ""Spacetime"", wherein the title is repeated in a comically spooky voice, as if it were the intro to some old Saturday morning cartoon.) Given their fondness for the classic and the plastic, it's no surprise Gardens &amp; Villa feel equally at home recording their album with piano-bar bard Richard Swift as touring with hipster hype magnets Foster the People.</p>
<p>But if the ambiguous quality of their sound sometimes makes it hard to become emotionally invested in Gardens &amp; Villa, in Lynch, they're blessed with a singer who has remarkable presence and poise. For all the effeminate intimations in his voice, he never uses it for pure affectation or gratuitous, histrionic effect. And though the band has been quick to cite the percussive funk of Talking Heads as a driving influence, they truly excel at crafting atmospheric ballads: the Low-like hymn ""Chemtrails"" and, especially, the foreboding ""Sunday Morning"", a rainy-day requiem that favorably recalls the retro-futurist psych-pop of the United States of America or Broadcast. It's hard to predict where Gardens &amp; Villa might go from here: bombastic, drum-circle-ready closer ""Neon Dove"" carries the possibility of Yeasayer-styled transition from misfits to populists, while ""Orange Blossom"" suggests a desire to join Wild Beasts on the art-funk fringes. But in the flute-tootin' Lynch, they've got a pied piper worth following down whichever path he takes.</p></div>"|15603.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15603-gardens-villa/|6.8|Stuart Berman

The ambient theorist of <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11731-discreet-musicambient-1-music-for-airportsambient-2-the-plateaux-of-mirror-with-harold-buddambient-4-on-land/"">Discreet Music</a></i>? The prog-jazz dabbler of <i>Nerve Net</i>? Or the film music composer of <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14828-small-craft-on-a-milk-sea/"">Small Craft on a Milk Sea</a></i>? Maybe you think of him mainly as a virtuoso technician, an innovative pop producer, a prodigious collaborator, or a visionary mixed-media artist. His broad range of talents and activities makes getting your head around his catalogue about as plausible as <a href=""http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/11/27/1259345052173/Former-Roxy-Music-band-me-001.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">giving him a haircut</a>, and it's natural for us to establish our own versions of what his baseline aesthetic is. Whoever the ""real"" Eno is to you, he's bound to show up at least once on his second LP for <a href=""http://warp.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp Records</a>, a mercilessly erratic collaboration with the poet <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/RickHollandPoet"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rick Holland</a>.</p>
<p>You could say with only slight hyperbole that Eno's signing to Warp last year was like the Beatles joining <a href=""http://www.elephant6.com/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elephant 6</a>. The British label's eclectic roster-- <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"">Broadcast</a>'s cerebral electronic pop, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"">Autechre</a>'s ascetic IDM, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a>'s synthetic naturalism, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>'s ambient techno-- could reasonably be called the Eno Diaspora. <i>Small Craft</i>, a collaboration with <a href=""http://www.leoabrahams.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Leo Abrahams</a> and <a href=""http://www.jonhopkins.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jon Hopkins</a>, was oriented around music composed for (and rejected from) Peter Jackson's film <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0380510/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Lovely Bones</a></i>, but with its jungle breakbeats, ambient drones, and computer glitches, it sounded like Eno refracting Warp's own history. In other words: Eno making music influenced by Eno.</p>
<p><i>Drums Between the Bells</i> retains many qualities of <i>Small Craft</i>, including propeller-like live percussion and mildly dated whiffs of trip-hop and downtempo. The big difference is that the music is built around Holland's words, read by a number of different speakers. As it doesn't rely on the ironic voice and language games of modern fashion, Holland's richly imagistic poetry is well-suited to the project. The music around it is scattershot, but not random: Each song is designed to complement the poem at its center. Still, the record has a rather unnerving pace, overpowering and retiring in quick alternation. ""Bless this Space"" opens  things inauspiciously with an electronic jazz fusion setting, which is about the most unsympathetic environment for a poet imaginable. ""<a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12177-glitch/"">Glitch</a>"" is musically livelier, with a mightily abrasive climax, but the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HAL</a>-like vocal treatment flattens Holland's poem into numbingly literal sci-fi boilerplate.</p>
<p>Then, abruptly, a suite of meltingly lovely tracks arrives and does real service to Holland's poetry. The arctic pianos that encircle a crisp female voice on ""Dreambirds"" recall Eno's prior work with <a href=""http://haroldbudd.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Harold Budd</a>, just as the liquid guitar of ""Pour It Out"" recalls the lighter side of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12546-no-pussyfooting-evening-star/"">Fripp collaborations</a>. Despite its dystopian tendencies, Holland's writing has a plain-hearted tenderness that female voices seem to draw out more subtly than male ones. On these two tracks, as well as ""Seedpods"" and ""The Real"", Eno reacts to the female voice with great sensitivity. The result is like a gentler companion to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14317-homeland/"">Laurie Anderson's <i>Homeland</i></a>: no ironclad beats hammering down on the words, but a gossamer web cradling them with all due reverence. The oracular hush fits Holland much better than stentorian force.</p>
<p>Even when <i>Drums </i>dips into sketchy territory-- the reggae-styled ""Dow"", for example-- it's hard not to be intrigued by Eno's command of sonic texture, weight, and spatial dimensions. Nothing feels vaguely formed. With the ability to realize microscopically precise details and effects, he makes the reconciliation of extremes feel inevitable: A river of industrial slag might flow into saucy jazz horns; funk riffs might level out into a thick krautrock haze. We can count on these kinds of pleasures even from a so-so Eno record, and <i>Drums </i>is better than so-so. The problem with it, beyond a handful of unflattering genre excursions, is a slight but persistent thinness of imagination. The concrete music of ""Fierce Aisles of Light"" conjures the feel of being on a train with impeccable accuracy, but it's a pat setting for lyrics where trains feature prominently. When a minute of silence, called ""Silence"", appears near the end of the record, it's hard not to feel as though you're in the presence of an incredible talent casting about for the next big idea, casually producing minor wonders in the meantime.</p></div>"|15598.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15598-drums-between-the-bells/|6.6|Brian Howe

That <i>Galactic Melt</i> has been pretty much in the can for that entire time tells you  something about Haley's formidable work ethic; in addition to Truise, he  operates under at least three other pseudonyms, none as fully-realized  but each as prodigious.</p>
<p>Haley's  rapid-fire turnover plays incredibly well on the Internet. He's  something of a cottage industry, dispensing original tracks, remixes,  podcasts, and accompanying boxfresh graphic designs to his blog  readership and Twitter followers with impressive regularity. By  capitalizing on the immediacy of the formats, he's also charting his own  evolution in realtime. When he writes, ""I thought I'd switch it up a  little"" in reference to a remix he's just posted for <a href=""http://www.analolaroman.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ana Lola Roman</a>'s ""Klutch"", he's acknowledging that his listeners know what he means by ""it,"" and how it's been switched; everything is laid out with a clear progression,  one small evolution to the next.</p>
<p>The  comparative slow lane of a regular label release schedule, though, has a  habit of slowing down the flow of music, crumpling up its timelines and  deforming expectations. This usually doesn't matter to the end  listener; what's new to our ears is good as new. But since <i>Galactic Melt</i> sounds more like a polite and brotherly companion piece to <i>Cyanide Sisters</i> than it does a proper follow-up, it's hard not to feel like the tactic  of waiting to market has robbed Haley of some of some of his momentum.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is <i>Cyanide Sisters</i>.  As debut EPs go, it was an accomplished enough turn to raise questions  about what Truise might do for an encore. The answer, as it happens,  was, well, a slightly more muted version of the same. Don't get me  wrong: with its staccato, bonus level synth stabs, keening psychedelia  and 1980s-drenched drum sounds, <i>Melt</i> is still very identifiably Truise. But with the exception of the  banging double whammy of ""VHS Sex"" and ""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/Com%20Truise%20-%20Cathode%20Girls.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Cathode Girls</a>"", there's nothing much here to suggest that Truise has upped his game in any  meaningful way. Whether you consider that a disappointment will depend  on how much mileage you get out of Haley in this mode.</p></div>"|15604.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15604-galactic-melt/|7.3|Mark Pytlik

As on 2009's <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13334-see-mystery-lights/"">See Mystery Lights</a></i>, Portland laptop maestro Jona Bechtolt (formerly of <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/398-the-blow/"">the Blow</a>) and singer Claire L. Evans enjoy their smoothest sailing when they fully submit to sweaty euphoria; <i>Shangri-La</i> offers more than enough frantic beats, fidgety bass lines, spiky guitar leads, soaring piano riffs, delirious vocal harmonies, and, yes, cowbells to fit in on any house-party playlist. Still, its idyllic theme can be a bit heavy-handed, and nothing here is quite as indelibly hooky as past single <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11281-psychic-city-voodoo-city/"">""Psychic City (Voodoo City)""</a>.</p>
<p><i>Shangri-La</i> continues YACHT's trajectory from blips and bloops that suggest their computerized origins to a full-fledged band sound that should translate nicely to hedonistic live shows. But the duo's sense of, well, <i>fun</i> hasn't gone anywhere. <i>See</i><i> Mystery Lights</i>' nods to T-Pain and Desmond Dekker gives way to an end-times synth workout ""Dystopia (The Earth Is on Fire)"", which shares a seven-minute <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bcm8tkZDxXM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> with the tropical-flavored disco-punk of album opener ""Utopia"". When the pace slows, as on the spacey ""Love in the Dark"", instant quotables jump out: ""I love you like a small-town cop/ Yeah, I wanna smash your face in with a rock,"" Evans sings, in deadpan multi-track.</p>
<p>Still, the record tends to burden its good times with a few too many ideas that simply aren't that distinctive. Brass-boosted ""Holy Roller"", which starts as a finger-snapping cousin to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27257-the-black-lips/"">Black Lips</a>' religion-minded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/music-videos/376-black-lips/1417-veni-vidi-vici/"">""Veni Vidi Vici""</a> and ends closer to the doomed stomp of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse/"">Modest Mouse</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/music-videos/1490-modest-mouse/2331-fly-trapped-in-a-jar/"">""Fly Trapped in a Jar""</a> (by way of dubstep bass-wobble), recommends not worrying about a god. James Murphy-esque dance-rant ""Paradise Engineering"" finds holiness within.</p>
<p>The basic gist-- and despite its familiarity, it's a commendable one-- is that, as Belinda Carlisle once sang, heaven is a place on Earth. ""If we build a utopia, will you come and stay?"" asks <i>Shangri-La</i>'s closing, title track, all catchy la-la-las and beatific afterglow. Paradise, the song suggests, can be California, Oregon, Texas, or anywhere we choose: an appealing and valuable notion. But it's worth remembering that when new-wave forebears <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/630-blondie/"">Blondie</a> found <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHCdS7O248g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rapture""</a>, it was ""toe to toe/ Dancing very close.""</p></div>"|15581.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15581-shangri-la/|6.5|Marc Hogan

The band takes its name from a dangerous spider whose venom can cause skin lesions, so the <i>Fantastic Voyage</i>-like concern with bodily systems here seems fitting. This focus is there even when the lyrics turn towards the surreal, as when frontman Tim Meskers sings on ""Wooden Fingers"" about ""dreams still trickling from my eyes.""</p>
<p>The vague nature of dreams and memories pervades <i>Evening Tapestry</i>. The lyrical narration is often indirect and distant, recounting small, indelible details and visions both somnambulant (the surreal, cobweb-covered ""Statue Garden"") and conversational (""At Last"", which details a cab ride). The music itself takes on the form of creeping psychedelia, as organs sickly spin within baroque structures (the aptly titled ""Paisley Tears"") and even the simplest six-string jangle takes on a soft-focus blur. The overall approach owes something to the heyday of the Elephant 6 collective, though nothing on <i>Evening Tapestry</i> gets as far out as the Olivia Tremor Control's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ukMIhVbbUc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Green Typewriters</a>"" suite. Brown Recluse's own sunshine-blotter dabblings are more reminiscent of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/341-beulah/"" target=""_blank"">Beulah</a>, or the surreal sensitivity on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3139-of-montreal/"" target=""_blank"">Of Montreal</a>'s 1999 opus <i>The Gay Parade</i>. You can feel what Meskers is saying, even if the surroundings seem a bit strange.</p>
<p>With all the talk of paisley and psychedelia, it's important to note that <i>Evening Tapestry</i> is, first and foremost, an indie pop album (and one on the increasingly strong roster of resuscitated indie pop label Slumberland, no less). That means there's plenty of jangle and winsome melodical structures, recalling the dearly departed East Coast outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5717-pants-yell/"" target=""_blank"">Pants Yell!</a> as much as the usual suspects: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/777-the-clientele/"" target=""_blank"">the Clientele</a>, early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"" target=""_blank"">Belle and Sebastian</a>, indie-pop forebears the Zombies, and Brooklyn newcomers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27968-beach-fossils/"" target=""_blank"">Beach Fossils</a>. Unlike Beach Fossils' compartmentalized distance, though, Brown Recluse sound bright and direct throughout <i>Evening Tapestry</i>, like light shining through their sleepy fog. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GUa-8y1HSQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sort of like a dream?

Often seen outfitted in a luchador mask, Gonzales clearly has a flair for the theatrical, and his debut LP, <i>Ceremony</i>, strives for the cinematic. Rooted in drum'n'bass while touching on everything from 8-bit to dubstep to house, Gonzales aims to assault your senses with all the subtlety of a frying pan smack.</p>
<p>But for all its range, <i>Ceremony</i> suffers from being brazenly repetitive, relying on flash instead of substance and betraying a lack of restraint. Tracks are build around deep bass, throbbing swaths of electronics, and errant sound effects, all of which are usually contrasted by a mercurial element, like say, a brief, semi-melodious synth line. The resulting tracks sadly feel too truncated for the dancefloor and too monotonous for headphones.</p>
<p>Gonzales does have a solid feel for the role of percussion in his futuristic assemblages, such as the shakers and claps on the alien, evil ""Jaguar"" or the riotous cowbells on ""Fields"". And despite a lack of variance, Gonzales proves to be an interesting mimic at times, offering a slightly less-heady approximation of a Zomby track (""Fields""), and channeling a menace-dripping Massive Attack (""Restart""). The latter gets a boost from vocalist Sasha Perera, who finds herself in the esteemed company rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28274-freddie-gibbs/"" target=""_blank"">Freddie Gibbs</a> and folk-futurist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28016-helado-negro/"" target=""_blank"">Helado Negro</a>, proving, if nothing else, that at least the guy has taste.</p>
<p>But Gonzales' mishandling of those guest spots and the record's frankly obnoxious second half makes for a burdening listen. Gibbs tries to craft some semblance of a song out of the wonky bluster of ""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/Mexicans%20with%20Guns%20-%20Ridin%20Dirty.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Highway to Hell</a>"", but the track is a non-starter. Everyone else is simply drowned out by the racket, making Gonzales' ""look at me"" aesthetic feel even more masturbatory. (For some reason, only rapper Nocando gets a pass for his appearance on ""Got Me Fucked Up"", a song so hilariously awful it demands to be mentioned here.) Despite the thoughtfulness bestowed upon the Helado Negro-assisted closing track, it's of little consequence-- the record's end is reward enough. So, lesson learned: No matter how deep the bass is, it can't mask how shallow most of the ideas are.</p></div>"|15600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15600-ceremony/|5.5|Zach Kelly

He never significantly alters his rap style, but that style is such a hyper-technical, gangsta-rap blur that he always sounds impressive, no matter the context. Peers of mine have already written off Gibbs, claiming that it's a problem when he goes in the exact same way every time. I can see what they're saying, but that perpetual sturdiness is, for me, more a strength than a weakness. He just doesn't fuck up, ever. Gibbs recently signed with Young Jeezy's Corporate Thugz label, and that's an awkward pairing on paper. But as it turns out, the two Gibbs collabs on Jeezy's new <i>The Real Is Back</i> mixtape are the two most exciting tracks on the whole tape; without switching up his style at all, Gibbs sounds awesome over the lurching gothic evilness that Jeezy favors. Just by doing what he does, Gibbs fits into Jeezy's universe a lot more naturally than any of Rick Ross' recent Internet-rap protégés sound on the newish <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15472-mmg-presents-self-made-vol-1/"" target=""_blank"">Maybach Music Group compilation</a>.</p>
<p>For the <i>Lord Giveth, Lord Taketh Away</i> EP, Gibbs dips a toe into a scene far removed from Jeezy's populist drug-rap, teaming up with DJ and producer Statik Selektah, a pillar of East Coast traditionalist circles and an underrated beatmaker. The two recorded the entire EP in a single day, broadcasting the sessions on Ustream and selling the finished project a couple of days later. It's a quickie EP, just 19 minutes long, and almost every track has a guest appearance or two. But beyond its length, there's little indication that Gibbs cranked this thing out as fast as possible. Every once in a while, there's an awkwardly cryptic line that could've used a rewrite (""I just wanna make dough and fuck bitches like I'm a Latter Day Saint""?), but Gibbs maintains the same quick-moving tough-talk intensity that he's always displayed. If you're not sick of just hearing this guy <i>rap</i>-- and you probably shouldn't be-- there's a lot to like about this one.</p>
<p>Granted, nothing on <i>Lord Giveth</i> has the knife-edge intensity of a great Gibbs track like ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tKo0gyllKs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Murda on My Mind</a>"", and Gibbs doesn't try out anything beyond his most well-traveled subject matter. But he still has a way with an evocative image (""Man, it's so dry out here niggas be cutting they dope with vitamins""), and his syllable-by-syllable flow remains a force of nature. Statik's tracks work as pretty good facsimiles of the classically simple DJ Premier style, and Gibbs sounds just as comfortable on those as he does on Jeezy tracks. (I get the impression that nothing disturbs this guy; he could probably rap over, like, a Deerhoof song without blinking.)</p>
<p>Many of the album's guests come from Statik's usual circle of collaborators, gifted but grumpy East Coast guys like Termanology and Reks (the latter of whom airs out hopes ""for real MCs to kill the likes of Lil Bs,"" which should give you some idea what cultural milieu we're working in). Gibbs sounds coolest alongside guys from other regions, like Houston mainstay Trae, whose muttery nihilistic fast-rap baritone is similar to Gibbs' own, or Dogg Pound veteran Daz, who comes off badass even when he's rotely reciting his career accomplishments. But even the East Coast also-rans have their moments. I especially liked Push! Montana's extended ""Home Improvement"" riff: ""I'm Tim Taylor with the tool, man/ Play Wilson, try to peek over the gate/ Soon as I see your brow, I squeeze it in your face.""</p>
<p>That clever ignorance is a small pleasure, like most of the pleasures on<i> Lord Giveth</i>. But even if it's nowhere near his strongest release, <i>Lord Giveth </i>remains a solid showcase for one of our most solid rappers.</p></div>"|15599.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15599-lord-giveth-lord-taketh-away-ep/|7.2|Tom Breihan

And they did it for 18 years. From 1987 to 2005, the Baltimore quartet could be considered the world's leading purveyor of punk-rock-as-devotional-art. They were a band hellbent and single-minded in their commitment to ascetic thrashing, with an amply bearded and tattooed frontman who came off like underground music's answer to John the Baptist.</p>
<p>For all that, Lungfish's music sounds immediately familiar. It's just a handful of cyclical guitar riffs and pulsing, sea-shanty rhythms played in steady repetition. ""A person doesn't have to be Lungfish-literate to know how to hear our music,"" singer Daniel Higgs <a href=""http://www2.citypaper.com/story.asp?id=13921"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> the <i>Baltimore City Paper</i> in 1998, during one of the band's only extensive interviews. ""If you've never heard the song before, after several seconds you have heard the song, and it's gonna do that for a few more minutes."" Like the best punk bands, Lungfish used common tools, but created singular music through sheer force of personality.</p>
<p>Totaling 11 albums, Lungfish's catalog can be intimidating, but 1999's <i>The Unanimous Hour</i> is a good place to start. Recently remastered and repressed by Dischord, Lungfish's long-out-of-print eighth record is among the band's sturdiest statements. On first listen, it sounds a lot like any other Lungfish record: Two or three chords repeat ad infinitum while Higgs belts out apocalyptic psychobabble. But this record has a special place in the Lungfish discography. It's a pivot point between the band's early years and the laser-guided minimalist riffage that would predominate its final three records.</p>
<p>Even before the Internet sped up underground music's turnover rate, Lungfish's evolutionary pace was unthinkably glacial. This is one band that never hired a string section, bought a drum machine, or contemplated a sudden creative left turn. Each record shed a few more superfluous notes, reducing the music to its barest, heaviest essence. Early on, Lungfish tempered their sound with some basic concessions to pop music-- verses and choruses, mainly (""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4lqaWDEcHc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Friend to Friend in the Endtime</a>"", from 1992's <i>Talking Songs For Walking</i>, was hooky enough that it eventually wormed its way into Joan Jett's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axF8zgkzFPI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">setlist</a>). But Lungfish spent the subsequent years streamlining their approach.</p>
<p>By the time of <i>The Unanimous Hour</i>, the group had jettisoned conventional song structures in favor of unflagging hypnotic grooves. Opener ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2FNCAPs2LQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Space Orgy</a>"" barely budges from a single chugging chord that ping-pongs back and forth between guitarist Asa Osborne and bassist Nathan Bell. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_KLaD6sqqA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mated</a>"" thunders along on an unceasing two-note bass line. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRifEqKmca0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vulgar Theories</a>"" pushes a single fuzz-drenched riff far enough to stare down the most fully zonked Spacemen 3 tune.</p>
<p><i>The Unanimous Hour</i> also finds Higgs shifting gears as a vocalist. He further ditches the pretense of linear narrative, embraces hymn-like forms, and makes his words as repetitive as Osborne's riffs. The record holds some of Higgs' most subdued moments (the prayerful chant on ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1VGmgW8RtE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">God's Will</a>"") as well as his most far-out (the hissed lyric about a mirrored, ringing urethra-sprout on ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UAsPADG8Vo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Metatron</a>""). Epic album closer ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmYScRNuZJE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hallucinatorium</a>"" splits the difference between these two extremes, with parallel lines of prose detailing a family portrait that could have been snatched from a Max Ernst sketchbook.</p>
<p>""Hallucinatorium"" was initially put to tape as a short-winded instrumental, but upon hearing it, Higgs felt inclined to lay down a few verses. The problem: The original recording was too short to accommodate all the ribcages, hexagon faces, and living prayers the singer hoped to mention. Dischord co-founder and Fugazi frontman Ian MacKaye, who guided the recording sessions, suggested simply slowing the tape down in order to buy a few extra minutes-- an idea he cribbed from hearing the Prince Far I song ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNlMvVR93i0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Survival</a>"" played back-to-back with its pitched-down instrumental ""version."" So instead of picking up steam, the song tumbles into a dubby dream-world. Against the screwed-down sounds, Higgs' lyrics become deeper and heavier in their resonance.</p>
<p>During the group's 90s heyday, Lungfish were unfairly lumped in with the emo and hardcore scenes, mostly because their music came out on Dischord. A decade removed from that context, Lungfish records seem more in line with weirdo luminaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/21083-13th-floor-elevators/"" target=""_blank"">13th Floor Elevators</a> or contemporary mystic-metal heads like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3222-om/"" target=""_blank"">Om</a>. Punk's basic impulse is fairly concrete, while Lungfish's inspiration is strictly otherworldly. The means of transmission, though, remains simple. On <i>The Unanimous Hour</i>, Lungfish use it to blast their message onward and outward into oblivion.</p></div>"|15592.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15592-the-unanimous-hour/|8.1|Aaron Leitko

Then ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQxjbofGO-o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wearing My Rolex</a>"" blew up. Everything since has been a jumble of pop moves, renunciations of said pop moves, double-reverse crossovers, beefs, mixtapes, label changes, and that one time last year the UK rapper/producer just up and released <i>eleven zip files </i>of unreleased beats for free. But Wiley also found the time to put together a completely self-contained, no-interference album, give it the autonomy-flaunting title <i>100% Publishing</i>,<i> </i>and get Big Dada to distribute it. It's almost like he just wanted to pick up where he left off before his chart bid.</p>
<p>Wiley's latest succeeds admirably as a figurative reset button, even as it's run through with the embattled energy and strident confidence of a creator intent on rejecting the sellout accusations that forced a stylistic reboot in the first place. <i>100% Publishing</i> bristles with the reflexive jabs and on-the-spot opinions that tend to come during long-distance sparring sessions with the nebulous @-flogging masses. The single-minded focus on wrangling a complicated commercial-vs.-underground reputation can feel exhausting at times, but the album's musicality makes up for it, with an improved vocal delivery and a collection of beats that expand on what drew attention to Wiley's production at grime's onset.</p>
<p>""Some days I'm asking God, but then the Internet is quicker,"" Wiley says on opener ""Information Age"". The album's distinctly online-borne attitude leads to a lot of defensive boasts. The title track reasserts Wiley's original DIY success story, and ""Your Intuition"" makes admitting past diversions and future changes into a sign of strength, while ""Wise Man and His Words"" stands up for the rapper's ""dual core"" fanbase. Hints of frustration still bubble under the surface; ""One Hit Wonder"" and ""Yonge Street (1,178 Miles Long)"" thrive on the tension between braggadocio and insecurity. But the main mood is one of defiant optimism. Single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42229-video-wiley-numbers-in-action/"" target=""_blank"">Numbers in Action</a>"" says it best: ""I reinvent, I'm like a brand new signing.""</p>
<p>Musically, the title track and ""One Hit Wonder"" boost Wiley's vintage ""eskibeat"" style with busier melodies and suppler drums. The stripped-down boom-clap beats for ""Numbers in Action"" and ""Yonge Street"" nod toward retro-modern club rap without all the Eurobeat bombast. Even the more unusual flourishes-- the having-a-larf circus melody of ""Boom Boom Da Na"", or the melancholy piano line of ""Wise Man and His Words""-- have dead-serious rhythmic pulses beneath them. Chirpy shuffle-step love track ""Pink Lady"" and instrospective, R&amp;B-tinged ""Talk About Life"" seem like they'd work better in the context of ""rhythm &amp; grime"" project <i>Chill Out Zone,</i> but these pop-oriented cuts are the exceptions.</p>
<p><i>100% Publishing</i> benefits from a deeper focus on the other side of the boards, too. Wiley wasn't always the slickest-flowing rapper, but if there's one part of his game that's really stepped up, it's his relationship with his own beats. He's so locked in that even his playful lyrical moments (""Make a silly move, career-ending/ I'm an Avatar when I'm Airbending"") stand up to the bass the voice nimbly ricochets off. It might be hasty to applaud a return to form for an artist who's spent the past few years coming to terms with what that form's supposed to even mean. But it's still great to hear what Wiley can do when left to his own devices.</p></div>"|15595.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15595-100-publishing/|7.5|Nate Patrin

But while free mixtapes can boost the profile of a rapper at any level without earning a legit dime, comedy records are at best peripheral income streams for their headliners and useless for most everyone else.</p>
<p>But this release makes sense for Norm Macdonald. While he's managed to be at least on the periphery of cultural awareness over the past two decades on screens both big and small-- ""Saturday Night Live""'s Weekend Update, the cult classic <i>Dirty Work</i>, and the recently canceled ""Sports Show with Norm Macdonald""-- none of it involves him telling jokes on stage for 40 straight minutes. Not even 2006's album <i>Ridiculous</i>, which mostly compiled skits done with his famous friends. But if you liked him in any of those guises, <i>Me Doing Standup</i> is pretty much foolproof, a likable set from a guy who's basically never had to break character in his entire career.</p>
<p>Macdonald's delivery has a certain expressive deadpan to it, a slack-sounding outsider cadence that's quietly insightful and insidiously hilarious. He imparts meaning through small gestures and inflection such as a homespun pronunciation of ""pillow,"" or an eyebrow raise at his own recognition of the word ""defibrillator."" And <i>Standup</i> might be one of the few comedy records you'll hear that's quite literally timeless. There isn't one instance where Macdonald gives an indication of what year it is. Even stranger is how absorbing it can be even though Norm Macdonald, the human being, is all but removed from the proceedings. I can't think of a comedy album that's less beholden to the life of the actual person who made it. That his own father died from a heart attack comes off as a small asterisk to the larger point of how our own bodies are the terrorists most likely to end our lives (""He wasn't expecting it, he was looking for fuckin' Arabs and shit""), and he only pledges political allegiance to officials who can eliminate death by their second term.</p>
<p>Indeed, though softened by his affability and implicit self-deprecation, <i>Me Doing Standup</i> is almost entirely obsessed with mortality, even if cancer, heart attacks, murder, and alcoholism are namedropped with the gravity comedy usually grants to consumer products. It comes nowhere near the high-wire truth-telling of Louis C.K., nor does it really attempt to push any sort of measure of taste. Macdonald acknowledges his existence as absurd to the point where even he hardly takes it seriously. Within the first couple of minutes, he pledges ""that's my goal in life-- is not to die"" even though he ""come[s] from a long line of death."" Ultimately, <i>Me Doing Standup</i> really does end up honoring its title's definitiveness, as it's something like the quintessential Norm Macdonald set: occasionally indulgent, frequently hilarious, and always managing to make this strange guy come off as likeable everyman.</p></div>"|15587.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15587-me-doing-standup/|6.5|Ian Cohen

As if the band name weren't laughable enough, they also call themselves a ""brutal orchestra,"" and that's still just the start. ""Sea"", the first of the album's dual 24-minute tracks, features former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a> vocalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2168-jarboe/"" target=""_blank"">Jarboe</a> intoning words of wisdom about inhaling darkness and exhaling light and peace. <i>Alchemic Heart</i>'s second side, predictably called ""Land"", features Japanese noise lord <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2744-merzbow/"" target=""_blank"">Merzbow</a>. Both guests have added their names to ham-handed collaborations in the past. With <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"" target=""_blank"">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a> again on the road, how many ensembles with sociopolitical messages and half-hour attention spans do we really need?</p>
<p>We at least need Vampillia, especially here. Somehow, the band avoids nearly all of its potential pitfalls, navigating both of these marathons with agility and strength. ""Sea"" is at first an exercise in delicacy and restraint, the massive ensemble building slowly through the sort of deep instrumental breaths recognizable from Bang on a Can's interpretation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11731-discreet-musicambient-1-music-for-airportsambient-2-the-plateaux-of-mirror-with-harold-buddambient-4-on-land/"" target=""_blank""><i>Music For Airports</i></a>. The additional layers come steadily, with a harmonic electric guitar riff sliding between the orchestra's ebbs and light percussion serving only to make each of those movements more encompassing. Jarboe's steely whisper sits inside the music, demanding attention without stealing it. The first nine minutes or so generate tension, while the last 14 are a slow, menacing release. Assisted by Brooklyn noise outfit Inswarm, Vampillia writhe through a wall of sound, with violins trilling, guitars grinding, and voices bending and clipping. It's as if the orchestra is trying to recreate the static and squall of early black metal-- simply stretched and compressed to sound even more malevolent. Jarboe is eventually left in sudden silence, repeating her mantras with resolve. The conclusion, like the track itself, is melodramatic, but it feels warranted, its impact real.</p>
<p>Despite a similar length, exploration of peak noise, and quiet<span> dénouement</span>, ""Land"" takes a much different approach from one point to another. The graceful cycles of the strings on the first piece are swapped for stunted, staggered phrases here, made even more disorienting by Merzbow's bursts of alien noise. ""Land"" is almost immediately loud, each layer occasionally syncing into enormous swells of sound. Again, though, Vampillia quiet down as the track nears its 10-minute mark, with little pockets of Keith Jarrett-like piano splashing through an electronic haze. ""Land"" takes its time to rebuild, but when it does, the sound suggests that these dozen or so musicians are trying to control chaos. Merzbow's shards of electricity don't overrun the orchestra; instead, he pulls them forward, making the violins more dramatic and each changing piano chord more momentous. The music hits its crest with about four minutes left, and the sound is infernal. Voices and strings and electronic bursts collide constantly. It's terrifying, exhilarating, and intricate.</p>
<p>This sort of music is easy to get wrong, to make too maudlin or too context-dependent. From the hit-and-miss guests to the ambitious two-tracks, two-sides format, Vampillia have a lot stacked against them on <i>Alchemic Heart</i>. Both of these pieces demand and deliver, though, using high drama to lubricate urgent compositions.</p></div>"|15594.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15594-alchemic-heart/|8.0|Grayson Currin

And it's true that Curren$y raps more about getting high than most people do, and that his fluid, heavy-lidded drawl does a better job evoking the experience. But Curren$y's become an interesting figure with a lot going on, and to focus on his cannabis appetite is to ignore some of the things that make him one of the more dependable working rappers. For one thing, he's become a workhorse. In the past year, he's put out four ridiculously solid solo releases-- and that's not counting his kinda-sucky <i>Return to the Winner's Circle</i> mixtape, his crew's <i>Jet Life to the Next Life</i> mixtape, or his scores of guest appearances on other people's tracks. Those four solid releases paint a picture of a musical adventurer, a guy who tests himself against a new style of production whenever he gets bored.</p>
<p>On last year's two <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14474-pilot-talk/"" target=""_blank"">Pilot</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14906-pilot-talk-ii/"" target=""_blank"">Talk</a></i> albums, Curren$y made his way through producer Ski Beatz' lush shag-carpet psychedelic soul, a luxurious retro sound. Then, a couple of months ago, he released the free Alchemist-produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15385-covert-coup/"" target=""_blank""><i>Covert Coup</i></a> EP, which gave him a chance to navigate Alc's tense, broken boom-bap-- a dizzy, refracted take on classic New York rap. Compared to those other records, the sound on <i>Weekend at Burnie's</i> is remarkably warm and approachable, and it brings Curren$y closer to the sound of current radio-rap than he's been in a while-- though, of course, he's still a long way from any serious rotation. For this one, he links up with producer Monsta Beatz, whose diffuse, melodic synths sound like a low-key version of the smoothly emotive style that's helped turn Drake and Wiz Khalifa into stars. The music on <i>Weekend at Burnie's</i> drifts by in an exceedingly pleasant haze.</p>
<p>Now, <i>Weekend at Burnie's</i> won't turn Curren$y into anyone's idea of a star. His idea of a chorus is still something like this: ""Get paid, get paid my nigga, get [long pause] paaaid."" And his rap style doesn't employ the sort of attention-grabbing punchlines that leap through club speakers to grab you. Instead, his delivery is more an unhurried run-on that hits various ideas and images along the way without pounding any of them home. Though the music on his albums has changed, his slippery delivery really hasn't, and it's remarkable how completely at home he sounds on just about any form of beat that he attempts. So maybe the best thing about <i>Weekend at</i> <i>Burnie's</i> is the way these unassuming Monsta Beatz tracks give him room to operate. You can hear the man better on this album than you can on many of his recent efforts. And that gives us plenty of room to admire his slick little turns of phrase. A line like this one deserves to be heard: ""Haters tryna deplete my shine like venetian blinds/ But son do what the sun do: rise.""</p>
<p>In terms of subject matter, <i>Burnie's</i> doesn't exactly push Curren$y outside of his comfort zone. You never get the impression that much is at stake for Curren$y, even if this is his first commercial release since signing his new Warner Bros. deal. Protégés Trademark and Young Roddy both get plenty of mic time; beyond a single too-brief Fiend verse, they're the album's only guests. We never get to hear Curren$y expressing any sort of drive or urgency or emotion; he's always happy to rhyme ""ease"" with ""breeze."" ""<a href=""http://hulkshare.com/243fbx673ot5"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">She Don't Want a Man</a>"" is a fairly thin relationship-based story-rap that succeeds mostly because of a smeary cinematic keyboard sound that reminds me of Mario Winans' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTLLQU1jnXs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I Don't Want to Know</a>"". But Curren$y's a rapper so sharp and confident that he never <i>needs</i> to leave his comfort zone, and it's a lot of fun to hear him flexing his style on a sunnier sound palette.</p>
<p>On ""JLC"", near the end of the album, Curren$y indulges in a bit of paranoiac drug-dealer talk: ""Through text message, we plot the takeover/ Can't talk out loud 'round these chauffeurs/ Way on the outskirts of town, we have slick meetings/ Lookin' over our shoulders-- muhfuckin' lip readers."" I have no idea if any of this comes from Curren$y's personal experience or if he's just spinning yarns, but it's a packed-tight bit of writing, and he sounds unflappable as ever delivering it. In a moment like that, where you hear a guy deliver those dense lines so nonchalantly, you know you're in secure hands. <i>Weekend at</i> <i>Burnie's</i>, like so many other recent Curren$y releases, is full of those moments. This guy is still on a very serious roll, and it doesn't seem to be anywhere near over.</p></div>"|15591.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15591-weekend-at-burnies/|8.0|Tom Breihan

Insight without humor is preachy. Humor without frustration is toothless. Frustration without humanity is destructive. And humanity without energy is defeatist. If an album operates with the purpose of being a big noisy fuck-shit-up machine, missing just one of those elements can leave you with an overbearing mess, where every speaker-rattling burst of noise or cathartically screamed hook turns you back instead of getting you all riled up. Sacramento punk-rap outfit <a href=""http://thirdworlds.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Death Grips</a> are known for starting frothing mosh pits with a style that seems in keeping with the hardcore-meets-hip-hop confluence that first ran through skate culture a few decades back. <i>Exmilitary</i>, their free mixtape, is a bludgeoning slab of hostility<span> that plays like both sides of a circa-1987 Cro-Mags b/w Just-Ice home tape bleeding through each other.</span></p>
<p><i>Exmilitary </i>avoids any of the flaws outlined above, but it's still a potentially alienating album: unnerving when you're not on its aggro wavelength, inviting when you are, and transfixing either way, thanks to the aggregate work of Death Grips' core. The raspy, deliberate MC Ride doesn't so much flow as bellow. Producer/videographer Flatlander and co-producer Info Warrior hit both sides of the audio-visual equation with overloaded noise (check the ""Guillotine"" <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Orlbo9WkZ2E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> for starters). Additional vocalist Mexican Girl skulks in the background and spits venom for occasional effective emphasis. And Zach Hill, the Hella drummer-- recently heard on Marnie Stern's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14705-marnie-stern/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled album</a>-- provides some of the live percussion elements. But isolating each member's specific contributions seems like a good way to make an overwhelming sound seem flimsier than it really is.</p>
<p>That said, MC Ride might be the most upfront element. His tendency to go hard in the rawest way possible with doomsayer verses has slotted him in a strange no-man's land between Southern and avant-rap. His tangled, diabolical lyrics are wrapped up in lust, drug panic, metaphysical power-tripping, and political agitation, and he delivers them as if every syllable were an exclamation point. And while there's not a ton of nuance, there's a surprising versatility, as Ride's rhymes range from malevolent to anxious to smart-assed. Monolithic and harsh, his voice sounds powerful doubling up the beats to the point where it doesn't even seem like a problem when it's halfway buried in the mix.</p>
<p>The production does its damnedest to capture punk aggression for a hip-hop context without pushing things too far in either direction. Fuck-the-cops anthem ""Klink"" invokes Black Flag's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXQtl0ypU44"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rise Above</a>"", the opening scream from Bad Brains' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QroYQzS_UAk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Supertouch/Shitfit</a>"" punctuates ""Takyon (Death Yon)"", and the beat to ""Spread Eagle Cross the Block"" is built sturdily around Link Wray's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjs5QWjvNWc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rumble</a>"". On sex-maniac anthem ""I Want It I Need It (Death Heated)"", a devastating hijack of Pink Floyd's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHNQCdWOfdM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Interstellar Overdrive</a>"" perfectly conjures up this music's intersection of choppy, riff-heavy beat assault and psychedelic sprawl. Juke-inflected bangers like ""Thru the Walls"" and ""Blood Creepin"" blur <i>Exmilitary</i>'s stylistic lines, and that's good-- it means not having to worry about scene purity or crossover potential, and focusing instead on just how much ferocity you can take.</p></div>"|15583.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15583-exmilitary/|7.5|Nate Patrin

<p>Simko may have conceived the album thousands of miles to the south, but her formative Chicago house influence is certainly audible. The music is built firmly on a foundation of straight-ahead Roland beats-- nothing we haven't heard before, to be sure, but Simko has her own, often-engaging way of treating them once they're in place. Among her signatures is the way she wraps her basslines around the monolithic pulse of the kick drum. She keeps the bass tone as clean and shiny as new chrome and has a weirdly graceful way of integrating it-- it's like watching a cat sit down and slowly curl its tail around its front paws. This process is very easy to hear, because otherwise, Simko approaches her work with a minimalist's sense of space and patience, letting her club beats become mantras before introducing small changes.</p>
<p>For instance, she waits until nearly halfway through ""Beneath"" to introduce a new chord change, but when she does, it instantly brightens the music. On vocal tracks ""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/MindOnYou.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Mind on You</a>"", ""Had It All"", and ""Flight Into BA"", she uses her guest singers in much the same way she uses the rounded synth tones she's created, dropping them in at intervals as a way of evolving the music. ""Mind on You"", in particular, has a jazzy slide that the vocals almost get lost in. The one place where Simko works with messier sounds is ""Mira Vos"", which is invaded by strange synths that sound like doves cooing. All this adds up to an album that's strangely absorbing when you put it on in the background, but perhaps a little blank when you're paying close attention. You have to be in a mindset for minimalism when you listen to it, just as you would with Terry Riley or Philip Glass.</p>
<p>If <i>Lights Out</i> has a failing as an album for home listening, it's a run of three tracks that each stretch past seven minutes. These three songs (""Cairo"", ""Bikini Atoll"", and ""Last Breath"") push the overall running time past an hour and simply aren't that interesting outside of a club context. You can hear how they might work in a dark room full of people who are there to dance, but they push the minimalist angle a little too far for passive listening. Outside of that, <i>Lights Out</i> is a solid debut, albeit one that will appeal primarily to listeners well within the core dance music audience.</p></div>"|15577.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15577-lights-out/|6.9|Joe Tangari

Though bleak electronic music and live albums don't necessarily make good bedfellows, Tearist manage fairly well, mostly because singer Yasmine Kittles and beatmaker William Strangeland-Menchaca know how to work a stage. Listen closely and you can hear them swapping out gear, evolving their set-up, and refining their schtick. You can also hear the truth: These weren't big-time shows.</p>
<p>Tearist have recently grown buzzy enough to warrant their own <a href=""http://www.laweekly.com/2011-04-28/music/tearist-the-real-thing/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">L.A. Weekly</a> profile, but there were a few lonely rooms along the way. Some songs are followed by heavy applause, but sometimes Tearist's final notes give way to mannered clapping. Other tracks ring with the hollow and boomy sound of empty rooms. ""There's only one person here, that's so weird,"" Kittles says at one point. Like their cityfolk <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5789-abe-vigoda/"" target=""_blank"">Abe Vigoda</a>, Tearist are devout students of 1980s goth and industrial sounds, but they've taken that moody, studio-driven music and retrofit it for basement shows and DIY spaces. On songs like ""Civilization"" and ""Closest"", Strangeland-Menchaca pushes his electronic rhythms up to punk tempos, but keeps his basslines dry and squelchy.</p>
<p>Tearist don't really do hooks, though. Strangeland-Menchaca plays Martin Rev to Kittles' Alan Vega, blasting sparse and repetitive beats while the vocalist rants, writhes, and yowls animalistic grunts through a delay pedal. In other words, he lays down a steady foundation while she provides the dynamic. A live video of ""Civilization"" taped at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GevJO5Gx5zw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KXLU</a> provides a better picture of the band in performance. Strangeland-Menchaca hangs coolly in the background as Kittles works herself into a heavy froth, going all <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1306-einsturzende-neubauten/"" target=""_blank"">Einstürzende Neubauten</a> on a piece of scrap metal. In other words, <i>Living</i> really provides only half of Tearist's show: the stuff you can hear. And the stuff that you can hear on <i>Living </i>is fairly obscure.</p></div>"|15586.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15586-living-2009-present/|6.7|Aaron Leitko

Though the former <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/75-american-analog-set/"" target=""_blank"">American Analog Set</a> leader has since played about 150 shows with a standard bass-drums-guitar quartet, he again handles all the instruments himself on the second Wooden Birds record, conceived after a relocation from Brooklyn to Austin. Kenny even still taps the drums out on the body of his acoustic guitar. More important than <i>Two Matchsticks</i>' simplicity, though, are its songs, lessons of life and love conveyed in clear, unadorned language.</p>
<p>Kenny eases the songs out as parables, meant for consideration at length. Over a plain click-clack rhythm and sharp acoustic strums, ""Criminals Win"" tells how sometimes bad things happen to good people; lovers quarrel when they should be kissing, honest people work when they should be living, and bad guys win when they should be falling. ""Too Pretty to Say Please"" is a series of desperate observations on a lover who's never content with her counterpart; its spartan sonic set-up affords a certain freshness to Kenny's laments, as though he were too busy considering romantic wounds to write orchestra charts or to fuss over guitar tone. Indeed, time and again during<i> Two Matchsticks</i>, Kenny plays the part of the tour guide who's been here before: He's seen the co-dependence of the title track, the desolation of ""Cross My Heart"", and the leap-of-faith moment of ""Struck by Lightning"". At his best, Kenny is relaxed, direct, and relatable, sounding more empathetic than didactic.</p>
<p>Kenny isn't entirely without collaborators on <i>Two Matchsticks</i>. The sweet croon of Death Cab for Cutie's Ben Gibbard adds an appropriate measure of redemption to ""Warm to the Blade"", a song about pushing past heartbreak and finding new meaning. <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/2702-matt-pond-pa/"" target=""_blank"">Matt Pond PA</a>'s Matt Pond, who plays guitar and sings in the band's live iteration, duets with Kenny on ""Be No Lie"", turning the steely-eyed lament into the sort of romantic warning that would have fit on <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Elliott Smith</a>'s <i>XO</i>. And former American Analog Set guest vocalist Leslie Sisson, another onstage guitarist/singer for the Wooden Birds, takes the lead on ""Baby Jeans"", a charming take on a high-school crush. Patient, generous, and smart, the song proves that while Kenny does well to maintain the Wooden Birds' solitary core, he does well to expand it occasionally, too.</p></div>"|15590.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15590-two-matchsticks/|7.3|Grayson Currin

Their debut LP, <i>New Brigade</i>, has actually been out in their home country since January, with a much smaller, limited run coming to the United States earlier this year. These are the essentials. Over the past few months, as <i>New Brigade</i> has been passed back and forth online with increasing enthusiasm, there has been a remarkable amount of chatter, some of it focused on their age, some of it on their music, some of it on faraway mystique.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a <a href=""http://www.metroxpress.dk/kultur/teenagelmler-fulde-af-vrede-og-angst/pTekaj!10_4540-89/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Danish daily</a> deemed them ""teenage punks full of anger and anxiety,"" a line galvanized by bloody post-show photos of smiling audience members published on their blog. Questions like ""Are they the saviors of punk music?"" have been posed, as though punk music needs saving. They just played their first show in the U.S. this past weekend, in Brooklyn. It sold out. <a href=""http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/16/now-slammin-iceage-in-brooklyn/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The New York Times</i></a> and <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/arts/events/nightlife/2011/06/13/110613goni_GOAT_nightlife"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The New Yorker</i></a> have weighed in. They're set to return to Roskilde this summer. As you may have already realized, there's a swirl of information and interest surrounding this band right now, at the heart of which is their music.</p>
<p>And it turns out that <i>New Brigade</i> is a refreshing and extraordinary debut. These four have located a punk-rock sweet spot: mixing the black atmosphere of goth, the wild-limbed whoosh of hardcore, and the clangor of post-punk. It's a feat made all the more impressive by one very important intangible: energy. While they still have room to grow as songwriters, the energy in every atom of <i>New Brigade</i>'s charred, sub-25-minute rush is seductive. From the moment ""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/Iceage%20-%20White%20Rune.mp3"" target=""_blank"">White Rune</a>"" starts to quake until those last tangles of guitar conk out on closer ""You're Blessed"", there's little escape from this record's grip. Even the foreboding mash and march of ""Intro"", its wordless, 46-second pulse of a prelude, is enough to make you feel like you need to fling yourself in the direction of someone else.</p>
<p>That said, despite the typically direct, blunt-object nature of ""punk,"" much of <i>New Brigade</i> is also impressionistic. Elias Rønnenfelt's words (sung in English rather than Danish) are largely unintelligible, leaving a lot up to the heart and imagination. Rønnenfelt finds an effective way of sharing just enough room for listeners to fill in the blanks. As if mimicking the motions of his own guitar, he scythes his way through each song, usually to anthemic heights. That you can hear in the gasp of ""Collapse"" and starry-eyed bounce of ""Remember"". Even more so in aforementioned climax ""You're Blessed"", a song that sounds like a more irritable cousin to the poppy, post-hardcore emo that came of age here in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The album's grit has nothing to do with fidelity. While Iceage employ decidedly abrasive no-wave textures, <i>New Brigade</i> was recorded in a proper studio. The result is a recording whose snare hits and basslines announce themselves with real fury. And though a lot of this music might seem from a distance like a dozen ideas thrown together in the space of a single song, what they've done here is deceptively precise and exists on a deeply personal, unfiltered plane. All these lurches and groans and crashes and bangs and stutters and roars come together to form one consistently rousing, emotionally immediate whole. From them to you.</p></div>"|15576.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15576-new-brigade/|8.4|David Bevan

Though the projects sound very different, his songs for both bands rely heavily on his bleary-eyed lyricism and jagged guitar chug. But as Boeckner could tell you, there's an easy way to get people to stop comparing your side project to your main gig: just break up the latter.</p>
<p>But it's not just Wolf Parade's recently announced ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/40840-wolf-parade-go-on-indefinite-hiatus/"" target=""_blank"">indefinite hiatus</a>"" that casts <i>Sound Kaptial</i> as Handsome Furs' most passionate, committed album to date. Rather, by taking the emphasis off of Boeckner's guitars and giving greater shine to wife Alexei Perry's neon-bright keyboard lines and woofer-busting beats, Handsome Furs present themselves as a genuine, ready-for-the-floor synth-pop band rather than a frazzled rock act that happens to use synthesizers. With new wave confections like ""Memories of the Future"" and ""What About Us"", <i>Sound Kapital</i> effectively conjures an alternate 1980s where Bruce Springsteen didn't just tinker around with synths and drum machines on occasion, but actually tried to make a full-on Depeche Mode record.</p>
<p>However, <i>Sound Kapital</i> isn't so much an 80s throwback in sound as in its spirit of sincerity. A handful of songs on the record were inspired by the Furs' 2010 visit to Burma, where they performed alongside bands who were quite literally underground, forced to perform out of sight of the oppressive local authorities, with minimal access to electricity, let alone recording technology. Given that Boeckner's always been drawn to the struggle of the underdog, the experience of being around people who routinely risked incarceration just to play their music naturally had a profound effect on his songwriting; the opening song is built around a click-tracked chant-- ""When I get back home/ I won't be the same no more""-- that effectively serves as a promise to put aside petty, material-world concerns.</p>
<p>And rather than deal in general, impressionistic images of hearts on fire and shining lights, the album's centerpiece song, ""Serve the People"", pays tribute to the Burmese band Side Effect with street-level scenes of ""kids... making noise with their generators on till the cops say, 'move along.'"" It's the sort of arm-swaying anthem you could easily imagine the Furs' Montreal mates Arcade Fire turning into a Coachella-rocking showstopper. But the humbly lo-tech take-- all shuffling drum-machine breaks and squelching frequencies-- feels very true to the environment that inspired it, where music is exchanged via pirate radio and the power can be suddenly cut at any moment. The more frenzied companion track ""Cheap Music"" reframes the same scene, but downplays the overarching themes of valor and perseverance to convey the illicit, punk-rock thrill of hearing ""a thousand lonely kids making noise in the basement.""</p>
<p>Therein lies <i>Sound Kapital</i>'s greatest success: Handsome Furs no longer feel like a stripped-down antidote to Wolf Parade, but more like a band that's able to execute progressively grander, emotionally resonant ideas while staying within their limited means. And nowhere is that more evident than on <i>Sound Kapital</i>'s urgent, feedback-swathed closer ""No Feelings"", which, despite its seven-minute sprawl, counts as Boeckner's most immediately affecting performance since Wolf Parade's ""Shine a Light"". The song sees Boeckner returning to familiar concerns (emotional ennui, self-doubt) but as it reemerges from a My Bloody Valentine-like miasma for a final sprint to the finish, Boeckner's repeated claims that he's ""got no feeling"" provide <i>Sound Kapital</i> with a rare moment of irony: Everything about this song-- and this entire album, for that matter-- suggests this heart's still got a lot left to burn.</p></div>"|15579.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15579-sound-kapital/|8.1|Stuart Berman

And looking at the relatively traditionalist name of Ripatti's latest outfit or at their website, which features a photo of the group arranged in a clean and spacious wood-paneled studio on stand-up bass, acoustic drum kit, keys, and electronics, you might expect the Vladislav Delay Quartet to be a straightforward if modernist jazz band (Ripatti's roots are in jazz drumming). <i>Debut</i>, however, wastes no time in disabusing a listener of such notions.</p>
<p>The album opens with ""Minus Degrees, Bare Feet, Tickles"", eight minutes of cold, blistering, wind-tunnel static punctuated only barely around the halfway point by the introduction of a loose hi-hat and a distantly bleating clarinet. Even taken as a live-band extension of Vladislav Delay's chilly dub, this is pretty extreme, and it's a damn far cry from Ripatti's most lauded project, the artfully subdued vocal house of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2560-luomo/"" target=""_blank"">Luomo</a>. From there, though, the album opens up considerably, with ""Santa Teresa"", a nearly 12-minute long song anchored by a repeating, resonating upright bass pluck around which percussion clatters, saxophone squalls, and grains of delay cluster and scatter like a time-lapsed weather pattern.</p>
<p>""Des Abends"" continues in this vein and expands further. The same elements are at play-- percussion clatter, bass thrum, tinkling glass notes-- but here they echo through much larger, frostier acoustic spaces, and that photograph of the band all spread out in the studio starts to make a lot more physical sense.</p>
<p>Having established a pace and tone (willfully glacial, on both counts), the rest of the album begins to disrupt those parameters. ""Hohtokivi"" begins with the single most electronic sound on the album, a low, buzzing bass pulse that grows increasingly staticky across the song's seven-and-a-half minutes, letting off vents of steam and crackle and one final plume of feedback. ""Killing the Water Bed"" puts Lucio Capece's sax/clarinet playing upfront over Ripatti's busy cymbal rolls. ""Louhos"" introduces a dubbier vibe, propelled by a thick electronic kick drum beat. The relatively brief songs (at about four minutes apiece) ""Presentiment"" and ""Salt Flat"" provide the album's most ambient passages, the former creating a billowing fog of bass hum, the latter a brighter, optimistic coda, with what sounds like a church organ cresting over a ticking drum click and unreeling white noise.</p>
<p>If this sounds like a difficult listen, even from someone as consistently expectation-defying as Ripatti, it's actually a surprisingly enveloping, and immediately rewarding album. The songs have an open, improvised feel, and the tracks themselves, for all their icy howls and inclement racket, sound roomy enough to build a house and settle down in them. It's those acoustic spaces, almost more than the live instrumental flourishes with which the band inhabits them, that set the Quartet's <i>Debut</i> apart from what was already the more challenging of Ripatti's main guises, pushing Vladislav Delay into even stranger, more viscerally rewarding territory.</p></div>"|15561.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15561-debut/|7.2|Eric Grandy

""Regina"" sounded nothing like the skronky, speed-addled garage that had earned the Austin band a deal with RCRD LBL, and a lot more like a leftfield take on airy jazz rock. ""Breezy"" was the last adjective anyone was expecting to use for this band at that point, and the prospect of an full album of such tentative sap would've been enough to trigger the release of the dreaded ""cheese"" descriptor. Yet with their fourth album, <i>D</i>, White Denim double down on this very approach, and manage to make a pretty good LP out of it. How'd they do it?</p>
<p>By expanding. First, they grew to a quartet, adding second guitarist Austin Jenkins to their lineup. Second, they dropped some coin on better recording equipment, moving from a trailer to an actual studio. And <i>D </i>is easily White Denim's best-sounding effort yet: The band's trademark shape-shifting compositions now feature clean, interlocking guitar lines, and singer James Petralli's voice has smoothed out into a raspy howl.  It's also their most consistent album: Rollicking opener ""It's Him!"" sets the groovy Texas  psych template to which the rest of the record hews closely. Along the way, White Denim are able to stir in a new set of psychedelic flourishes-- see the flutes  and hippie lyrical mysticism of ""River to Consider""-- with the verve of a  Fillmore West opening band. Even the post-Maharishi Beatles vibe of closer ""Keys""-- complete with strings!-- feels like a  perfect extension of a confident band willing to stretch a bit. Who knows: Maybe it's a  teaser for the next album?</p>
<p>Personally, I'd prefer White Denim add a bit more <a href=""http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2009/01/keep-on-chooglin-.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">choogle</a> to their groove-- more oomph, a bit more low end to complement <i>D</i>'s fresh focus on detail and lateral movement. They certainly have the rhythm section for it, and how great would it be for the album's opening triptych to stir in a little ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRU8fEsq6nk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ramble Tamble</a>""? For now though, this LP's more than good enough. White Denim's inherent restlessness means that all the band's releases feel transitional to a degree, but <i>D</i>'s measured restraint points toward the best possible direction for them.</p></div>"|15589.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15589-d/|6.8|Eric Harvey

In late August of that year, indie-rock godfather Calvin Johnson organized the International Pop Underground Convention in Olympia, a six-day festival that housed a vast array of DIY-minded bands, from the Spinanes to Fugazi. The 20th anniversary of the convention is coming up in a matter of weeks, and it's tempting to speculate which of today's bands would make the lineup if it were held in 2011. With their fun-loving brand of lo-fi guitar pop, Seattle's <a href=""http://witchgardens.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Witch Gardens</a> would be a very appropriate choice.</p>
<p>Guitarist Casey Catherwood has been involved in Seattle's do-it-yourself music scene for almost decade, including a stint writing the Underage column for <i>The Stranger</i>. Given those bona fides, the light cloud of tape hiss that floats above the bright melodies on <i>Alice, Agatha, Branch &amp; Christ</i> feels like a genuine homage to direct forebears such as Beat Happening and the Vaselines, using those bands' playful artlessness to create eight infectious tunes detailing the joys and trials of youth. On ""So Many Parties"", after a false start and a tempo change, bass player Beth Corry, drummer Sara Beabout, and autoharpist Karolyn Kukoski capture the histrionics of a heartsick teenager standing in the corner of a birthday party: ""Here is not my home/ I'd rather die than be here alone,"" they sing. ""Softball Chick"" contains a hip-hop-inspired call-and-response that's charming rather than ironic-- a Nicki Minaj- or Trina-like assertion of female empowerment readjusted for the indie-pop set.</p>
<p>Each song on the brief album stands out as a unique pop composition, and several are split into movements, with frequent key and tempo changes. The intro to ""Small Daring Boy"" is the closest the record comes to a melancholy moment, but even that track shuffles back and forth between tempos, eventually making way for a driving, climactic finish that expresses heartbreak through a sweetly sung round (the lyrics: ""You were never good to me like I was good to you""). The only real miscue comes from the sequencing of bouncy closer ""Baby Got a Haircut"", which would have been more fitting as an opening track. But that's only a small error among the treats available on <i>Alice, Agatha, Branch, &amp; Christ</i>, an album that can stand proudly beside the work of the indie-pop heroes of yesteryear.</p></div>"|15495.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15495-alice-agatha-branch-christ/|7.2|Martin Douglas

The <a href=""http://lifeandtimes.com/pregame"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">camera phone clip</a> shows Beyoncé rehearsing her new album's opening eternal-love ballad, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12212-11/"" target=""_blank"">1+1</a>"", backstage at ""American Idol"". There she is: eyes shut, standing in front of a mirror, singing her guts out while family and friends look on in quiet awe. The video has a similar impromptu charm to the many intimate, one-shot performance clips popularized by Vincent Moon's ""Take Away Show"", its appeal compounded by the shock of seeing such a notoriously manicured superstar without embellishment. ""Help me let down my guard,"" she belts. And, as Beyoncé finishes the song, you hear her proud husband let out a joyous ""woo!"" It's all quite endearing and personal-- two words one might not often associate with this superhumanly talented and famous couple. ""Sometimes you need perspective,"" wrote Jay in an intro to the video on his <a href=""http://lifeandtimes.com/pregame"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Life + Times</a> website. ""You've been right in front of greatness so often that you need to step back and see it again for the first time.""</p>
<p>It's a fitting sentiment and song to introduce <i>4</i>, which largely deals with monogamy and all that comes with committing to one person for a potential lifetime. Which, like a bad marriage, might sound boring, repetitive, staid. But, in Beyoncé's more-than-capable and still-in-love hands, a relationship that lasts can seem as complicated and rewarding as anyone would hope. ""If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn/ 'Cause I got it with <i>you</i>,"" she testifies on ""1+1""-- potentially dubious words from a woman who certainly has ""something,"" but her mainlined vocals quickly dismiss mere logistics. The song boasts some of her finest-ever singing laid over a bed of warm and flowing synths, strings, and bass that manages to connect the dots between Sam Cooke and Prince without sacrificing any Beyoncé-ness. ""1+1"" is that rare wonder: a wedding song that pleases but doesn't pander.</p>
<p>The only recent pop ballad that comes close to its power is Adele's stunning ""<a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12105-someone-like-you/"" target=""_blank"">Someone Like You</a>"". But where that song-- and its massively successful corresponding album, <i>21</i>-- wrung out the aftermath of young heartbreak, Beyoncé is aiming for something a bit more challenging with <i>4</i>: love the one you're with, and have some fun doing it, too. The album's relative riskiness extends to its music, which side-steps Top 40 radio's current Eurobeat fixation for a refreshingly eclectic mix of early-90s R&amp;B, 80s lite soul, and brass'n'percussion-heavy marching music. All of the album's best elements, thematically and sonically, burst ahead on Jay-Z ode ""Countdown"", a honking, stutter-step sequel of sorts to ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViwtNLUqkMY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crazy in Love</a>"". The new track makes 10 years of loyalty seem just as thrilling as the first time, with Beyoncé offering her partner copious praise in that famed half-rap cadence: ""Still love the way he talks/ Still love the way I sing/ Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain.""</p>
<p>The album's carefree retro sensibility pops up on three more highlights, including the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a>-assisted ""Party"", which combines a pitch-perfect André 3000 guest verse, a Slick Rick sample, bubbly 80s keyboard tones, and 90s girl-group harmonies. The track has Beyoncé infatuated once again while its mid-tempo bounce provides prime summer barbecue background. ""Love on Top"" lilts like a lost Reagan-era smash, its light-as-air bop recalling Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, and Stevie Wonder at their sunniest. And ""End of Time"" is perhaps <i>4</i>'s most strident declaration of co-dependence; sounding like En Vogue remixed by a high school pep band, the song has Beyoncé finding the strength in two as she sings, ""I just wanna be with you/ I just wanna live for you/ I'd never let you go!"" That track-- along with most of <i>4</i>'s stand outs-- was co-written and co-produced by the star's <i>other</i> invaluable partner, Terius ""The-Dream"" Nash.</p>
<p>The pair first combined forces on super hit ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m1EFMoRFvY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)</a>"", but their collaborative relationship fully blooms on this album's ramped-up back half, including the bombastic, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/27663-major-lazer/"" target=""_blank"">Major Lazer</a>-sampling empowerment tract ""Run the World (Girls)"". As a songwriter, The-Dream has a way of drawing out a side of Beyoncé that's both more personal and brash, and, as seen on his several brilliant solo albums, his production style routinely references past greats while standing in the now. Tellingly, without his help the album stumbles, as on the overblown ""I Was Here"", a faceless, theoretically-inspirational slog written by veteran schlockmeister Diane Warren. (Unsurprisingly, ""I Was Here"" is the only cut on the record that wasn't co-written by Beyoncé herself, too.) Elsewhere, Babyface spearheads the decent ""Irreplaceable"" retread ""Best Thing I Never Had"", which probably wouldn't sound out-of-place on a Vanessa Carlton album, and <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/4031-the-sleepy-jackson/"" target=""_blank"">Sleepy Jackson</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27152-empire-of-the-sun/"" target=""_blank"">Empire of the Sun</a> leader Luke Steele worked on the ungainly ""Rather Die Young"", which ruins its Philly soul vibe with a theatrical Broadway glaze. (Steele also contributed an awful hook on Jay-Z's <i>Blueprint 3</i> trash-can bait ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwVHoktECEo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">What We Talkin' About</a>""-- can we get him away from this couple, please?)</p>
<p>Ironically, <i>4</i>'s deluxe edition comes with three bonus songs that would easily count among the proper album's finest moments. Chiefly, The-Dream co-written/produced ""Schoolin' Life"" is an irresistible Prince tribute that's much more motivational than ""I Was Here"" could ever be: ""Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?"" struts Beyoncé. The singer has said she recorded more than 60 songs while making <i>4</i>, and some of the wrong-headed inclusions are lazy attempts at re-creating her past hits. But they are few. And the lion's share of the album-- along with its excellent deluxe tracks-- has one of the world's biggest stars exploring her talent in ways few could've predicted, which is always exciting. After 2008's <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12462-i-am-sasha-fierce/"" target=""_blank""><i>I Am... Sasha Fierce</i></a>, which saw  Beyoncé catching up to trends when she wasn't trying Streisand-wannabe ballads, <i>4</i> is more akin to her wily sophomore solo album, <i>B'Day</i>. But where that record was preoccupied with the club, <i>4</i> is happy at home; on <i>Off the Wall</i>-style bonus track ""Lay Up Under Me"", the contented 29-year-old gushes, ""You ain't gotta worry 'bout a club, just come on lay up under me tonight."" If anyone can make a quiet Friday night come off like an open-bar blowout, it's Beyoncé.</p></div>"|15585.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15585-4/|8.0|Ryan Dombal

Another year or so of this, and ""minimal dubstep"" could go from a sub-descriptive side road into a full-on genre in itself. At that point, <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/mountkimbie"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mount Kimbie</a> could be posited as the new genre's equivalent of microhouse favorites like Pantha du Prince or Justus Köhncke. <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14412-crooks-lovers/"" target=""_blank"">Crooks &amp; Lovers</a> </i>was the UK duo's big breakthrough, the crystallization of an approach that theorized how a bass-centered, midrange-heavy style could be pared back into ambient music. Cohort and collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a> has taken more of the shine in that department, but the melodic strides and the pervasive sense of loose-jointed tension on <i>Crooks &amp; Lovers</i> managed to leave just as strong an impression over time.</p>
<p>But the point where minimalist becomes ephemeral is a dangerously easy one to cross, and it's hard to think of a better line-straddling example than the <i>Carbonated </i>EP. This release pairs a selection from <i>Crooks &amp; Lovers </i>and two new Mount Kimbie originals with a trio of remixes from a couple of London bass-music fellow travelers and an artist from a (slightly) more far-flung if compatible minimal techno background. The last effort clicks the most, likely because it's Peter van Hoesen at the controls; the Belgian producer who won raves from aficionados for last year's canyon-deep <i>Entropic City </i>takes the bubbly, R&amp;B-flecked ""Carbonated"" and flips the original's burbling rhythm into a Detroit-inflected pulse that has more groove and energy to it than anything else on the EP. That makes van Hoesen's remix something of an outlier, even if it's one of those outliers that also happens to be the best track out of six.</p>
<p>The other remixers work more closely alongside Mount Kimbie stylistically, but this time around their efforts feel a bit detached. While Airhead's remix of ""Carbonated"" has more of a direct connection to the source material than van Hoesen's-- making a primary element out of the distinctive propeller-whir hook that kicked off the original-- it spends too much time wafting along on little more than that murmuring throb, distant near-subliminal snares, and a simple bass kick that provides the least amount of momentum necessary to qualify this as a dance track. Klaus' remix of ""Adriatic"", meanwhile, takes the trickier route of building off a track without much to build on-- the original's only 88 seconds long, and worked more as a diversionary sketch than a highlight of <i>Crooks &amp; Lovers</i>-- opting to slow its snippets of acoustic guitar and soul vocals to a funereal crawl that drags on for five and a half minutes of quicksand entropy.</p>
<p>The untouched Mount Kimbie tracks have their own pull, though, and ""Carbonated""-- still one of the best cuts in the duo's arsenal-- is joined by a pair of unreleased tracks that give another couple of inroads into their sound. ""Flux"" rides on phased bell tones, liquid-trickle basslines, and hitching vocal yelps that intersect with hiccupy Brazilian <i>cuicas</i>, pulling itself up into a nice peak at the end. ""Baves Chords"" is a bit thinner-- hammer dulcimers and drum washes run through the same audio-stretching techniques that gave us the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYOCaJzW04Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">800% slowed-down remix</a> of Justin Bieber's ""Baby"", overlaid with glitchy harps, spare but cavernous handclaps, and warped, wordless chipmunk soul vocals. These tracks are both as wide-open in their rhythmic texture and their crackling warmth as the pair's best work, breathing and moving in ways that the remixes either fail to grasp or simply choose to circumvent. It's evidence that Mount Kimbie's knack for building sonic cathedrals out of empty spaces might just be more singular than you think.</p></div>"|15569.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15569-carbonated-ep/|6.8|Nate Patrin

While guys like Immortal Technique specialize in mouth-foaming sloganeering, Killer Mike comes across as a smart man with a short fuse. The hulking Atlanta rapper entered the game as Big Boi's bruiser friend, adding muscle to OutKast tracks like ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saGIFMS-V7E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Snappin' &amp; Trappin'</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5UJjQt3bkM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Whole World</a>"". But after a few years in major-label limbo and a messy split with Big Boi, Mike emerged as something else: a righteous underground-rap avenger, a live wire with a moral compass and a sensitive bullshit detector. On the great 2006 spleen-vent ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt9X1gvz728"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">That's Life</a>"", he treated the ineptitude surrounding Hurricane Katrina like it was a personal insult, and he responded accordingly: ""[Bush's] mama said the women oughta feel at home/ Getting raped in the bathroom in the Superdome."" That one song was a more effective rage-trigger than anything John Goodman roared into his webcam during season one of ""Treme"". But Mike's political fury never quite dominates his rapping; he's just as likely to unleash head-slap threats or promise to buy his wife fancy clothes as he is to get emotional about economic inequality. Paradoxically, that gives his political stuff more dimension; he's not a one-note persona; he's a man with a lot of opinions, and he knows how to express them with feeling and style.</p>
<p>With every album these days, Mike sounds more and more comfortable with the idea that he's always going to be an underground figure, not a major-league rap star. On the first track of new album <i>Pl3dge</i>, he addresses the major labels who presumably aren't knocking down his door anyway: ""If they talking major money, we can talk, and that's whattup/ If they ain't talking about that, then I remain indie as fuck."" A few major stars show up on <i>Pl3dge</i>, but they're guys with their own problems: T.I. and Gucci Mane, unable to stay out of jail, and Young Jeezy, unable to convince his label to release his album. For the most part, <i>Pl3dge</i> sounds like an album built to fly under the radar, a fiery old-school Southern rap record with no expensive-sounding beats and no concessions to any radio station on Earth.</p>
<p>The tracks largely come from unknown producers, but they're not thin or pedestrian. Instead, they're rock-solid utilitarian affairs with titanic drum sounds and stormy soul samples. There are a few curveballs, like the bubbling quasi-eastern No I.D. beat on ""Ready Set Go"", or the dazed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a> collaboration ""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/Killer%20Mike%20-%20Swimming%20(Produced%20by%20Flying%20Lotus).mp3"" target=""_blank"">Swimming</a>"". But even with those songs, the record still hangs together beautifully, offering up stylistic wrinkles while mostly sticking to a basic Southern trad-rap sound. Lyrically, Mike emits plenty of fury, decrying the police shooting of Oscar Grant and airing out some reservations in Obama: ""We appreciate the way you delegate for Henry Gates/ But what about your people slaving in the fields everyday?"" At one point, he even gets all <i>What's the Matter With Kansas?</i>, blasting white people for voting against their own economic interests, caving to the manipulation of the powerful because they've been convinced <i>they're</i> powerful. Smart stuff, but when it comes time to dish out some lurid street-level threats, he delivers: ""Have my Africans eat his face like he's some bush meat.""</p>
<p>As Mike's persona has developed, he's figured out what he's good at. On <i>Pl3dge</i>, he caters directly to the audience he's already built, going so far as to offer sequels to two of his best-loved recent songs, ""That's Life"" and ""God in the Building"". And a remix to ""Ready Set Go"" even gives Mike's audience the feel-good reunion with Big Boi that they've been hoping for. But even at his most consistent, Mike is still capable of surprising, as on the riff from ""That's Life II"", where he talks about Democrats being as bad as Republicans (""You can disrespect presidents and call 'em socialists/ But Palin and Pelosi both gon' have you broke as shit""), or Mike's decision to share the spotlight with amazing ranted promos from the titular wrestling legend on ""Ric Flair"". These aren't huge left turns, but they don't have to be. <i>Pl3dge</i> is constructed simply as a sturdy platform for one of rap's fiercest and most incisive voices, and it achieves that goal completely.</p></div>"|15580.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15580-pl3dge/|8.0|Tom Breihan

As such, it will not make a stellar accompaniment to your next barbecue.  Composed for brass ensemble, organ, and a light scrim of electronics, the album takes you places that are woefully ill-suited to early summer; it feels perfect for a grim, drizzly late autumn, when wet leaves are choking gutters and the air carries the threat of pneumonia. This might not be the most inviting sound world to contemplate, but Jóhannsson's confident touch with it is powerful, and <i>The Miners' Hymns</i> creeps into your consciousness like a musty attic draft.</p>
<p>Jóhannsson builds the album's six pieces out of a series of low tones echoing faintly across a distance, like ships through fog. Extended periods of charged silence separate each burst. The structure is firmly ""EVENT-pause-EVENT""-- a meek cluster of sound, an evaporation of echoes, a blank band of dead space. The effect is like slipping pebbles in a pond, watching the ripples distort your reflection, and then waiting for the surface to clear. Jóhannsson's pacing with this material is patient unto funereal, and occasionally the music appears to be just hanging there. But train your focus on it, and you will sense the slowly darkening atmosphere. The lonely horn figure of ""Freedom From Want and Fear"", for example, gathers weight with each repetition, so that when it blares, halfway through the track, the contrast registers like a flash of heat lightning.</p>
<p>The album was recorded in a Durham cathedral, and Jóhannsson has given the music a distinctly liturgical feel--  the descending bassline in ""There Is No Safe Side But the Side of Truth"" mimics the groaning sway of Renaissance sacred music. And when two sourly whining quarter tones give way to a gorgeously warm brass chorale in ""The Cause of Labour Is the Hope of the World"", the album's final track, it feels like an epiphany, a generous flooding of light that casts a backward glow on all the gloom and pallor that preceded it. Suddenly, the album's mood retroactively shifts. It's not a bleak autumn record; it's a halcyon autumn record, bathed in inviting half-light. I am reminded of playing basketball at dusk, and that imperceptible moment when you <i>just can't see anymore</i> and everyone reluctantly heads inside. It's a quietly exhilarating ""hallelujah"" that depends entirely on the previous 45 minutes of buildup for its weight, a nice reminder that some things are worth sticking it out for.</p></div>"|15578.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15578-the-miners-hymns/|7.7|Jayson Greene

His music is defined as much by its constraints-- self-imposed, mostly-- as by its content (that he has worked as a mathematician makes perfect sense). But here, Dyrdahl has strays from the strictures of beatific electronic music in favor of tone-poem ambience.</p>
<p><i>Sagara</i> was commissioned by Norway's <a href=""http://www.oyafestivalen.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Øya festival</a>, which provided Dyrdahl the resources to travel to a place of his choosing and study music. After sampling musicians in Bali and Java, Dyrdahl abandoned the idea of a dance album and instead focused on incorporating the tones and modalities of Gamelan music into pillow-soft mood pieces. It's not much of a stretch: Gamelan is typically busier and noisier than <i>Sagara</i>, but its massing of percussive sounds can lead to an ethereal blur. Dyrdahl takes that blur and spreads it, jam-like, over long instrumental passages.</p>
<p>The resulting sound isn't ""new"" unless you're the type of person who owns only diskJokke albums, but Dyrdahl's background as a classically trained violinist and electronic producer serves him well here. <i>Sagara</i> has a rich, saturated ambience that deserves a fine sound system and a generous twist of the volume knob, but it's uneventful in a way that suggests patience. This is nowhere more evident than on ""Mandena"" which, after three minutes of bare nothingness, acquires a misty palpitation and a splattering of percussive tones. At just over 35 minutes long, <i>Sagara</i> is refreshingly unimpressed with its own concept or bigness. It is a short, loving letter from Dyrdahl to a music and region that has inspired him.</p>
<p>It's not until the final track, ""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/Panutup.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Panutup</a>"", that Dyrdahl's instincts as a dance producer get the best of him. He lifts his tonal haze, offers some gorgeous ringing chords and field recordings before introducing-- finally!-- a thwumping disco bassline and a steady, surging kick drum. Dyrdahl spins this sudden percussiveness into a skyward, uplifting Balearic anthem before fading it out again. It's a moment of such surprising and stunning motion that it's possible to view the previous 30 minutes of music as one long, patient build. (There is an irony to the notion that the one time Dyrdahl really approaches the beauty and mysticism of Gamelan is when he interrupts his experiment and returns to his craft.) Dyrdahl never received enough credit for the excellent sound design of his work, and while <i>Sagara</i> seems nothing more than an interesting detour, his careful ear and sense of structure are here in spades.</p></div>"|15584.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15584-sagara/|6.4|Andrew Gaerig

The music was some of the most exploratory hip-hop of the year, an enticing batch of fragmented raps and woozy, disorienting beats. You could find precedents for this stuff-- the amorphous wanderings of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/781-clouddead/"" target=""_blank"">cLOUDDEAD</a>, the jazz rap of the early 1990s-- but these EPs were largely on some <i>sui generis shit</i>: Nothing else out there sounded quite like Shabazz Palaces.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14286-of-light-shabazz-palaces/"" target=""_blank""><i>Shabazz Palaces</i> and <i>Of Light</i> EPs</a> featured an MC going by the name Palaceer Lazaro, and he introduced an alternately glittering and gritty urban noir taking place in the unlikely setting of Seattle. That the reedy yet resonant voice behind Palaceer's raps was readily identifiable as Ishmael ""Butterfly"" Butler of downtempo rap collective <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29141-digable-planets/"" target=""_blank"">Digable Planets</a> (and, later, Cherrywine) did little to lift the shroud. Butler declined interviews and dodged photographers, and when he did speak, his answers were as evasive as his raps were richly, if obliquely, illustrative.</p>
<p>His reticence was an attempt to let the music speak for itself and avoid comparisons to his previous acts (adding some alluring intrigue didn't hurt). And some comparisons are inevitable: The EPs continued the darkening trend that occurred in between Digable's unlikely breakthrough <i>Reachin' (A New Refutation of Time and Space)</i> and thornier follow-up <i>Blowout Comb</i>, and which developed further with the sinister funk of Cherrywine. But if Shabazz Palaces' first phase was about building a mystique, their Sub Pop debut is the product of opening up. <i>Black Up</i> lets some sunlight in, breathes fresh air, and finds Butler returning to an occasionally lighter flow, the most unburdened he's sounded since the world first heard him. Which is not to say that these are easy, uncomplicated songs. Butler continues to eschew traditional verse-chorus structures in favor of tracks that unpredictably diverge and then pool into lone, evocative words or concise chants. And if some of Butler's rhymes and sonics are breezier than before, his tracks still retain their moody, hard-thudding, and sometimes psychedelic atmospheres.</p>
<p>Most of these tracks end somewhere very different from where they begin. ""Free Press and Curl"" opens the album with a down but defiant rap (""Musically and bitch-wise, too/ I lost the best beat that I had"") delivered over stuttering crunching drums and bass vibrations. Three minutes in, the tempo slows into a kind of galley song, a murky drift over which Butler fires off a couple of final, biblically imperative (""thou shalt..."") verses. ""An echo from the hosts that profess infinitum"" (the album's track titles throughout are fascinating) begins as a playground chant stretched and smeared into a queasy loop over muffled kick and grainy snare. But then after a minute, everything drops out for a spooky mbira solo from Shabazz sideman and percussionist Tendai Maraire. ""Youlogy"" starts as a busy, druggy swirl-- a heaving bass, a synth wobbling in one ear, voices cut and pasted, echoing asymmetrically, everything dropping out on the word ""high"" in ""to get you HIGH""-- and then breaks for some jazz trumpet and snippets of stylized dialogue, before proceeding as an altogether different, relatively cleared-out, bass-and-drum track.</p>
<p>That Shabazz Palaces' songs follow such inscrutable routes makes it all the more striking when they coalesce around a repeated word or phrase. ""Free Press"" builds up to the rousing chant, ""You know I'm free!"" over a ghosted gospel chorus. On ""Are You... Can You... Were You? (Felt)"", Butler exclaims, over ringing piano notes, wafting strings, and one great tinfoil handclap that swings in just half a beat later than expected, ""It's a feeling!"" ""Recollections of the Wraith"" glides in on two of the album's most effortless choruses, Butler first proclaiming/promising, ""Tonight!"" over a swooning, oohing female vocal, and then requesting, ""Clear some space out/ So we can space out."" That last one is about as involved as any chorus here gets-- these are hooks boiled down to their most essential.</p>
<p>Even forays into traditional structure end up typically idiosyncratic. The album's lone loverman song comes out a treatise-- well, actually, ""A treatease dedicated to The Avian Airess from North East Nubis (1000 questions, 1 answer)"". It's birds and bees rendered as bop poetry, working up to an insistently smooth come-on line that turns from astral to anatomical with the addition of one little two-letter word: ""I want to be there/ Let me be in there."" The record's dis track, ""yeah you"", snarls and bites but it also laments and ends as a breathless, headlong exorcism. All this is both in keeping with Butler's track record and indicative of his status as a hip-hop elder, an MC with some well-earned gray in his goatee. And it's deeply refreshing to hear an artist who exudes such depth and consideration.</p>
<p>Still, Butler is hardly yelling the kids off his lawn-- in fact, two of <i>Black Up</i>'s best moments come from young guest stars THEESatisfaction, a similarly ""afro-eccentric"" female duo with whom Shabazz Palaces have been collaborating for much of the past year. Cat Satisfaction lends her rich singing voice to the dusty, repurposed jazz of ""Endeavors For Never (The last time we spoke you said you were not here. I saw you though.)"", while partner Thee Stasia raps over the hard, roboticized boom bap of album closer ""Swerve... The reeping of all that is worthwhile (Noir not withstanding)"". That the last sound you hear on the album is one of THEESatisfaction's voices echoing out into the ether feels like an anointment and a look ahead (news that Sub Pop signed the duo leaked back in February).</p>
<p>For all his recent (relative) forthrightness, Butler is still fascinated by art's ability to communicate what conversations cannot. ""I can't explain it with words/ I have to do it,"" he raps on one song; on another, he delivers one of the album's catchiest, most motivating maxims: ""If you talk about it, it's a show/ But if you move about it, then it's a go."" Beyond the ""just do it"" swooshing of these lines is a meatier paradox: that Butler uses a lyrical form to decry the limitations of words and exalt the meaningfulness of action. In Shabazz Palaces, Butler enacts the union of these opposites-- words as action, action into words-- and it's no exaggeration to call this transmutation what it is: magic.</p></div>"|15570.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15570-black-up/|8.8|Eric Grandy

It felt as if the duo of Benjamin John Power and Andrew Hung were shifting around vast tectonic plates of noise, daring one another to see how much detail their music could retain while pushing the volume firmly into the red. That love of scale remains firmly intact on Power's debut album under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29644-blanck-mass/"">Blanck Mass</a> moniker, although he's purposefully tempered its overall feel with a more reflective bent. This is a themed work, based around ""cerebral hypoxia and the beautiful complexity of the natural world"" according to the Blanck Mass <a href=""http://blanckmass.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a> page. At times it crosses paths with the folksy elements of the <a href=""http://ghostbox.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghost Box</a> aesthetic, where creepy electronics are twisted to produce the kind of deadened atmosphere found in old horror flicks like <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchfinder_General_(film)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Witchfinder General</a></i>. It sometimes shares that film's lack of refinement, with Power allowing his sounds to loop over vast expanses of time, matching Fuck Buttons' prowess for chiseling crude beauty from repetition.</p>
<p>Much of this music is rooted in the ambient tradition; there are no beats, and Power often leans heavily on a wash of wave-like noise similar to what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> cultivated on ""Alternative 3"" from <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11732-music-for-films-apollo-thursday-afternoon-more-music-for-films/"">Music for Films</a></i>. On first glance it can feel like there's little structure underpinning the glass-like inflections of ""Sifted Gold"" or ""Chernobyl"", but dig a little deeper and subtle shifts in tone and mood gradually unravel. It demonstrates how adept Power has become at adding and subtracting layers of gentle abstraction in his music. <i>Blanck Mass</i> also shows how well he can foster an atmosphere of unease without pushing everything skyward all the time. Occasionally it threatens to topple over into a Fuck Buttons-style morass of jagged edges, but on songs like ""Sundowner"" the prickly distortion dissolves into clear digital glitchiness. The track has a woozy atmosphere, causing it to feel like Power and his table of instruments are rocking back and forth on a creaky old ocean liner.</p>
<p>Elsewhere the Blanck Mass sound sinks into introspection. ""Sub Serious"" is a densely layered piece full of twinkling loops and percussion elements that make it sound like it was recorded in the middle of a rain forest. The mood subtly slides from pessimism to dejection throughout; on ""Sub Serious"" it's the former, while the similar ""Land Disasters"" and ""Icke's Struggle"" use great swells of synth to generate an air of sadness. The latter two songs both use sampled birdsong, one of the few overt attempts to maintain the natural-world theme. Occasionally Power steps close to his other band's territory, particularly on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12192-land-disasters/"">""Land Disasters""</a>, where he channels that wall of gnarly distortion again and sets it to the kind of icy interference that dominated ""Sundowner"". Those two tracks feel like distant cousins here, both feeding off the same kind of ultra-frosty banks of towering electronics that Power was clearly obsessed with creating during the making of this record.</p>
<p><i>Blanck Mass</i> reaches its apex in the form of the extraordinary 13-and-a-half minute ""What You Know"". The shifts in tone encompass many of this album's contrasting styles, including the glacial pile-ups of noise and the dips into impossibly quiet reflection. At its close there's even a hint of groove as a bass synth expands and contracts, ultimately blocking out the rest of Power's palette and opening up new lands for him to explore with this project. The air of serenity shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone familiar with Fuck Buttons' work-- in many ways <i>Blanck Mass</i> functions as a continuation of the bittersweet emotion pulled out of the closing <i>Tarot Sport</i> track ""Flight of the Feathered Serpent"". But this mostly feels like Power taking all his musical impulses and tunneling inward toward a more nuanced spot. The shadow of his other band always feels like it's on his shoulder, but that tension between his past and present guises is what makes this work so well. Blanck Mass is all about Power excavating new domains while still working within that great glut of voluminous space he's already mapped out.</p></div>"|15572.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15572-blanck-mass/|7.7|Nick Neyland

Since then he has quietly issued a handful of singles. In January, Wruhme-- né Gabor Schablitzki-- put together a sly, melodic mix for Cologne's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/labels/275-kompakt/"" target=""_blank"">Kompakt</a>, followed in April by <i>Thora Vukk</i>. Released on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1201-dj-koze/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Koze</a>'s increasingly impressive Pampa imprint, Wruhme's second LP is an elegant, eminently listenable blend of chirpy beats, homespun voices, and sighing keyboards.</p>
<p>Wruhme's music has taken a path similar to that of one of his contemporaries, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2142-isolee/"" target=""_blank"">Isol</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2142-isolee/"" target=""_blank"">é</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2142-isolee/"" target=""_blank"">e</a>; tracks that once feasted on funny noises and unexpected pops have been smoothed over, like practical jokers settling into masters of the quip. <i>Thora Vukk</i> also has something in common with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29422-nicolas-jaar/"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Jaar</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15122-space-is-only-noise/"" target=""_blank"">Space Is Only Noise</a></i>; both are albums of modest treated-keys beauty, though Wruhme's music is deeply rooted in house traditions and tempos that Jaar's plays fast and loose with (or, more accurately, slow and loose).</p>
<p><i>Thora Vukk</i> is a sunrise album, one that sits lightly. Its tracks don't build and peak so much as arrive and taper. ""Brucke Eins"", already a placid interlude featuring dollops of organ, ends with someone calmly pecking at a keyboard. Wruhme uses voices sparingly but memorably; ""Pnom Gobal"" features a back-and-forth between casual scatting and a string section. The closest<i> Thora Vukk</i> comes to cresting is a breakdown during ""Tulpa Ovi"", in which a skittering break comes to a stop for joyful call and response between a performer and a child audience.</p>
<p>It's telling that <i>Thora Vukk</i>'s most memorable moment occurs when the music all but drops out, but it's also misleading. Wruhme's sound design is careful and deep; the album's homespun feel is in tone only (it would be lazy to compare it to the sweet, sepia-toned photograph on the album's cover, but, well, yeah). He leaves plenty of space between the muted chirps of his drums and those lovely velvet keys, and there's lots to be gained by playing the record loudly on a good system. Wruhme's career path and stature make <i>Thora Vukk</i> the type of album that never escapes the clutches of house connoisseurs, but fans of Jaar and even Four Tet will find a lot to like in its pacing and beauty.</p></div>"|15549.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15549-thora-vukk/|7.9|Andrew Gaerig

The EP secured official release by the end of the year through <a href=""http://hipposintanks.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Hippos in Tanks"">Hippos in Tanks</a>, and the increased attention Halo was drawing made sense. <i>King Felix</i> prominently featured Halo's expansive vocal range (also exercised on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29470-ford-lopatin/"" target=""_blank"">Ford &amp; Lopatin</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28693-games/"" target=""_blank"">Games</a>-era cut ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15229-strawberry-skies-ft-laurel-halo/"" target=""_blank"">Strawberry Skies</a>"") doing curly-cues and loop-de-loops above beds of tickled, arpeggiated synths; the results recalled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Projectors</a>' disjointed acrobatics as much as the cosmic analog odysseys of Brooklyn pal Daniel Lopatin's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>. As the electrifying cover art of the Hippos in Tanks re-release suggested, the music possessed a strange, swarming quality, originating at a central point and covering everything in its path.</p>
<p><i>King Felix</i> sounded like a blueprint for something larger and more sweeping, a hint at greater potential not quite realized. But on Halo's latest EP, <i>Hour Logic</i>, she takes a sharp left turn, largely ditching anything that resembles conventional melody for dark, propulsive rhythms where her beats run wild. As heard here, Halo's version of dance music comes over as sterile and inert-- the beats are there, but they never coalesce into anything in particular. When they're not static (as they are on the constant drip of ""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/Aquifer.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Aquifer</a>"") they wind up lost in the clutter. She moves through some intriguing ideas-- the acid squiggles that surface near the end of the title track, ""Speed of Rain""'s dewy beat-broken opening-- but there's a lack of momentum and the tedium disrupts <i>Hour Logic</i>'s flow.</p>
<p>For all its relative experimentation, the EP's most impressive moment takes place during  ""Constant Index"", which finds Halo's distant cries submerged in synth washes and long stretches of delay. It's no coincidence that Halo is at her best when returning to-- and refining-- the ideas presented on <i>King Felix</i>. So <i>Hour Logic</i> ultimately seems like an intermittently interesting misstep, a bold experiment that doesn't quite come off.</p></div>"|15568.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15568-hour-logic-ep/|5.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

Hell, even when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2010-the-hold-steady/"" target=""_blank"">the Hold Steady</a>'s ivory-tickler <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6448-franz-nicolay/"" target=""_blank"">Franz Nicolay</a> embarked on a similar <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12670-major-general/"" target=""_blank"">side project</a>, certain expectations came with the mustache. All we know is that there's label machinery legitimizing <i>Shirts vs. Skins </i> as more than just downtime with Bandcamp, that it's deemed worthy of our attention by more than just the guy who made it. So what does Wright have to say?</p>
<p>Well, to find out, you have to get past ""Chucklefucks"", which unwisely decides to incorporate its title-- one of the least euphonious not-quite words in the English language-- into Wright's prickly, pitter-patter melody. It just piles on from there. Soon come the skittering drum machines and lyrics that lean heavy on signifiers instead of insight (""the party kids,"" ""the party,"" ""pockets overflowing with designer drugs""), the sort of things usually found on the relationship-altering demo CD your friend made that you'll never unhear.</p>
<p>But after that mercifully brief 80 seconds, ""Heaven's Just for Movie Makers"" is a comparatively welcome respite, hewing more towards TPC's modes of zippy tempos, generously upfront vocals, and sharp, concise hooks. It's also more indicative of <i>Shirts vs. Skins</i><i> </i>as a whole. The album hangs looser than Wright's main gig, however, dabbling in rootsy singer-songwriter fare, giddy synth-pop, and too-cute saxophone skronk. The lyrics also lack TPC leader Dave Monks' cryptic, literary bent. They tend toward straightforward girl talk laced with proper nouns, recalling the ""like K-Ci &amp; JoJo, like Sonny and Cher, you're Tina but I'm not Ike"" kicker from ""Favourite Colour"", off of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14335-champ/"" target=""_blank""><i>Champ</i></a>, the 2010 album by Wright's main band.</p>
<p>All of which means that if you can trust I'm using the phrase ""<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3160-welcome-interstate-managers/"" target=""_blank"">Welcome Interstate Managers</a>-</i>era Fountains of Wayne"" as a sales pitch rather than an exit cue, this might be in your wheelhouse. <i>Shirts vs. Skins</i><i> </i>does feel weirdly out of time in 2011, its power-pop classicism and sense of irony having a decidedly mid-1990s vibe that values kitsch over actual nostalgia. ""Soviet Race"", in particular, could've found refuge in the buzzbin. Its narrative about astronauts and international espionage doesn't mean much upon the slightest inspection, but it's all prelude to Wright's biggest chorus, which takes obvious pleasure at stressing, ""I was shitfaced!"" while serving a softball to the egghead critics who generally eat this stuff up (""I read your book... I give it three stars out of a possible five"").</p>
<p>To Wright's credit, <i>Shirts vs. Skins</i><i> </i>actually manages to be catchier in a more straightforward way than either <i>Champ </i>or its 2008 predecessor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11426-elephant-shell/"" target=""_blank""><i>Elephant Shell</i></a>, two records that certainly didn't lack hooks. Whether or not you <i>want </i>these songs to stick in your head is another matter entirely, and it'll be largely based on your tolerance toward the standard options in the power-pop package deal-- namely, the stilted dialog and single-serve plots that make it feel more like a collection of sitcoms than songs; the overbearing pursuit of cleverness; and the weirdly dismissive attitude toward females that often reduces them to a single crush-worthy quirk or some incorporeal straw-woman that dumped your sorry ass.</p>
<p>You might end up taking the latter's side on ""Leftovers"", which stretches a single relatable image way too far. ""Something Stupid"" quotes Uncle Tupelo but is mostly an unspoken homage to Fountain of Wayne's ""She's Got a Problem"", or any other song that disguises wimpy condescension as actual concern. Likewise, ""Canadian Thanksgiving"" poses as brotherly advice to a moony-eyed teen but more or less turns into a bro's tall tale about a pretty girl who gets a few drinks in her and inevitably ends up embarrassing herself in a restaurant bathroom.</p>
<p>Despite all of the above, this album might still hold a huge appeal for listeners. This stuff's not unlike gangsta rap-- you come for the formalism and escapist pleasures, not for the nuanced take on gender relations. But for such a casual record, <i>Shirts vs. Skins </i>can occasionally strike at a deeper discussion. Power-pop of this sort is often overlooked, but it can also be stifling taken in large doses-- Wright's clear talent and occasional charm notwithstanding. The wacky neighbor POV wears pretty thin, but ultimately more oppressive is the glorification of generic heartbreak. It makes allowances for juvenile self-absorption that actual romance never does.</p></div>"|15553.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15553-shirts-vs-skins/|4.9|Ian Cohen

The first version of the band released two albums, the crackling, sexually aggressive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15493-suede-deluxe-edition-dog-man-star-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank"">debut</a> and the grotesque, brilliant, and dark follow-up, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15493-suede-deluxe-edition-dog-man-star-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dog Man Star</i></a>, made as Butler and the rest of the band were pulling apart. The original version of the band fed on the tension between its two songwriters, Butler and vocalist Brett Anderson, and the records it made were harrowing and complex, both musically and lyrically.</p>
<p>When the band reconstituted after its messy split with its guitarist, Anderson was in no mood to make another <i>Dog Man Star</i>. It's a difficult kind of record to follow up-- to come back with something that aimed for the same epic sweep and catharsis of that album would have ensured failure. Instead, when Anderson began to write with his new partners, he sought to change almost everything. The new Suede would be a very different band from its predecessor, even though it had the same singer and rhythm section. The new pieces had a lot to say about that. Oakes and Codling immediately began writing new material for the band, and Anderson found that what they were writing fit well with the new direction he hoped to take the band in.</p>
<p>It wasn't a clean stylistic break, necessarily. Oakes had found his way into the band by sending a demo tape to the Suede fan club; when Anderson overheard drummer Simon Gilbert listening to it, he thought it was an old Butler demo, and the 17-year-old guitarist vaulted to front of the long line of people auditioning to be Suede's newest member. Codling came to the band more conventionally: He was Gilbert's cousin, and the new songs they'd been working on immediately after Oakes joined required keyboards, so he was hired. This new three-way creative partnership was considerably less volatile than the Anderson/Butler pair, and partly as a result, the music lost its dark edge.</p>
<p>Back in the band's early days, Suede were heralded as one of the banner acts of the UK music media's new Britpop obsession-- a fact that chagrined and even disgusted Anderson-- and <i>Dog Man Star</i> had in some respects been Anderson's attempt to show that Suede were something distinct from Britpop. The band's next album, <i>Coming Up</i>, released in 1996, feels somewhat like Suede jumping back on board the movement it helped launch. At the very least, it finds the band returning to its glam-rock roots, and it's about the most day-glo rock record this side of <i>Ziggy Stardust</i>, with an intentionally garish Peter Saville sleeve to match. It vaulted the band back to massive commercial success in the UK, selling over a million and a half copies and spawning five top 10 singles.</p>
<p>Listening today, the album's biggest shortcoming is its lack of low-end. Producer Ed Buller chose to highlight the vocals, guitar, and synths over the band's formidable rhythm section, a decision that unfortunately leaves the album's roughly 50/50 mix of bouncy pop songs and melancholy ballads sounding a little thin. <i>Coming Up</i> is still a very good album, though. Anderson's lyrics are considerably more superficial and humorous than they had been in the past; this would eventually become a problem, but on uptempo, fluorescent rock songs like ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqovGKdgAXY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beautiful Ones</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PdKGDMhau4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trash</a>"" it works because these songs are just so damned catchy. And there is a lot of depth in the ballads. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDivCGk14E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">By the Sea</a>"", actually written by Anderson during the Butler years, is simply beautiful and heartbreaking, while ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEWn0aVcuSM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Saturday Night</a>"" works perfectly as a long exhalation at the end of the album's long and disorienting party.</p>
<p>The album is reissued with all of its contemporary B-sides, minus the Neil Codling demo ""Digging a Hole"", which is omitted without explanation. This is very important, because there's a whole second album on disc two that's easily as good as <i>Coming Up</i> itself. The epic slash of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGRxJZesNLM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Every Monday Morning Comes</a>"", the relentless dub stomp of ""WSD"", the grinding descent into debauchery of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlt85hJNyoI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Europe Is Our Playground</a>"", the exhilarating pop rush of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsF5p4fRUFY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sound of the Streets</a>"" and Anderson's baritone-voiced lead on the scuzzy, <i>Dog Man Star</i>-ish rock song ""Have You Ever Been This Low?"" are all essential to understanding just how versatile this band was at this point in its career, and that's just a sampling of the 19 B-sides included on this set. This is an important theme of this reissue campaign, and one that will become even more important later.</p>
<p>The huge success of <i>Coming Up</i> left Suede in a position to do basically anything they wanted with their next album, but it took three years for the band to put together the follow-up. Codling was at times bed-ridden with chronic fatigue syndrome after the grueling 18-month world tour in support of <i>Coming Up</i>, and Anderson had fallen deeper into drug addiction, especially crack. Bassist Mat Osman, who along with Simon Gilbert has always been a source of stability and reason for the band, recalls Anderson's drug buddies hanging around a lot during the sessions and generally ruining the atmosphere. The UK music press interpreted the long wait between albums as a sign that things were going wrong and that the next LP might be another <i>Dog Man Star.</i> When <i>Head Music</i> finally came out in 1999, anticipation was so high in Britain that Virgin Megastores all over the country changed their name to Head Music for a day on the release date.</p>
<p>The album wasn't another <i>Dog Man Star</i>, but it was considerably darker and thornier than <i>Coming Up</i>. The band worked with producer Steve Osbourne to get a much heavier, more groove-oriented sound, and Codling's synths moved to the center of the sound. <i>Head Music</i> is neon to <i>Coming Up</i>'s day-glo, and it's aged well sonically-- it is easily the band's most underappreciated album. Part of the reason for that is Anderson's lyrics, which on certain songs were simply terrible. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TxbME3fdBg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Savoir Faire</a>""'s notorious opening couplet, ""She live in a house/ She stupid as a mouse,"" is the worst offender, but the slide toward superficiality that began on <i>Coming Up</i> accelerated here, with Anderson sounding more like a bored observer than participant in the nightlife he sings about.</p>
<p>Most of it sounds splendid, though. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNPA68htGxk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">She's in Fashion</a>"" is a simply effervescent and weightless pop song; the mysterious orchestral swirl of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9UIijZwwQY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Indian Strings</a>"" is captivating; ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRYn3inFa-k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hi-Fi</a>"" has a chunky electro bounce that still sounds modern; and the slinking pop noir of ""Asbestos"" easily forgives the sometimes clunky lyrics. The band's attempts at stomping, punky rock on ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGeFkrfrHLc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Can't Get Enough</a>"" and ""Elephant Man"" might have been better replaced by breezy fluid B-sides ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAA5_ZdlUNk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Leaving</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVQ6qBfukU4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Let Go</a>"", though, and Anderson's solo acoustic stab at political commentary on ""Crack in the Union Jack"" is expendable. Perhaps reflecting the band's unsettled state at the time, the period B-sides overall aren't the world-beaters of the past, and they're spread across different producers (here again, a Codling-sung B-side, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mzEUaXcdpA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Weight of the World</a>"", has been left off).</p>
<p>Suede's final album, <i>A New Morning</i>, is almost an afterthought in the context of the band's whole career. In his liner notes, Anderson wonders whether it even should have been made and imagines a much different tracklist from what actually went on the album. The disc of B-sides here is very important, because it's easily better than the proper LP-- it's the reason I'm rating this reissue higher than I did the album on its original release. The band was coming apart as it made the record. Codling had left due to his illness, though he still contributed some songwriting; he was replaced by Alex Lee, the former keyboardist for good-but-forgotten Britpoppers Strangelove. For his part, Anderson had kicked drugs and isolated himself to write songs.</p>
<p>The record that came of all this is Suede's sunniest and most organic, but also its least substantial. On ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6p4BNtyVPI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lonely Girls</a>"", Anderson outright repeats himself-- the song is a list of girls, coupled briefly with something that each of them does, which makes it a virtual re-write of the old B-side ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG0gS6HLfQ4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Young Men</a>"". His voice was also worn by years of abuse, and he sounded a little ragged singing the otherwise buoyant hooks of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sddLmRe2vl8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Obsessions</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipX71-P7Cpk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Positivity</a>"", though it's hard to begrudge him the brighter outlook he displays on those songs. Listening to all the music here, though, it's easy to hear how, by bringing songs such as the stately ballad ""Simon"", the strangely haunting acoustic singalong ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP6u9zFoN5M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Campfire Song</a>"", and the unusual, slightly psychedelic ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCeg87ZcjbA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Instant Sunshine</a>"" out of B-side exile, they could have pieced together a better album from these sessions. Still, <i>A New Morning</i> is not a bad record, and it sent the band out on a hopeful note that was strikingly at odds with much of what had preceded it.</p>
<p>The five-piece Anderson/Codling/Gilbert/Oakes/Osman version of Suede has reunited and is touring, and a few years ago Anderson and Butler reconciled and made an album together as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8295-here-come-the-tears/"" target=""_blank"">the Tears</a>. Anderson has a budding solo career but has left the door open to a possible Suede album sometime in the future. If it never happens, so be it-- the band's legacy is already sealed. These three albums, and <i>Coming Up</i> in particular, show a band that picked itself up remained creative and worthy in the wake of what could have been a fatal loss. These releases give us that whole run in all its messy imperfection.</p></div>"|15571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15571-coming-up-deluxe-edition-head-music-deluxe-edition-a-new-morning-deluxe-edition/|7.9|Joe Tangari

The first version of the band released two albums, the crackling, sexually aggressive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15493-suede-deluxe-edition-dog-man-star-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank"">debut</a> and the grotesque, brilliant, and dark follow-up, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15493-suede-deluxe-edition-dog-man-star-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dog Man Star</i></a>, made as Butler and the rest of the band were pulling apart. The original version of the band fed on the tension between its two songwriters, Butler and vocalist Brett Anderson, and the records it made were harrowing and complex, both musically and lyrically.</p>
<p>When the band reconstituted after its messy split with its guitarist, Anderson was in no mood to make another <i>Dog Man Star</i>. It's a difficult kind of record to follow up-- to come back with something that aimed for the same epic sweep and catharsis of that album would have ensured failure. Instead, when Anderson began to write with his new partners, he sought to change almost everything. The new Suede would be a very different band from its predecessor, even though it had the same singer and rhythm section. The new pieces had a lot to say about that. Oakes and Codling immediately began writing new material for the band, and Anderson found that what they were writing fit well with the new direction he hoped to take the band in.</p>
<p>It wasn't a clean stylistic break, necessarily. Oakes had found his way into the band by sending a demo tape to the Suede fan club; when Anderson overheard drummer Simon Gilbert listening to it, he thought it was an old Butler demo, and the 17-year-old guitarist vaulted to front of the long line of people auditioning to be Suede's newest member. Codling came to the band more conventionally: He was Gilbert's cousin, and the new songs they'd been working on immediately after Oakes joined required keyboards, so he was hired. This new three-way creative partnership was considerably less volatile than the Anderson/Butler pair, and partly as a result, the music lost its dark edge.</p>
<p>Back in the band's early days, Suede were heralded as one of the banner acts of the UK music media's new Britpop obsession-- a fact that chagrined and even disgusted Anderson-- and <i>Dog Man Star</i> had in some respects been Anderson's attempt to show that Suede were something distinct from Britpop. The band's next album, <i>Coming Up</i>, released in 1996, feels somewhat like Suede jumping back on board the movement it helped launch. At the very least, it finds the band returning to its glam-rock roots, and it's about the most day-glo rock record this side of <i>Ziggy Stardust</i>, with an intentionally garish Peter Saville sleeve to match. It vaulted the band back to massive commercial success in the UK, selling over a million and a half copies and spawning five top 10 singles.</p>
<p>Listening today, the album's biggest shortcoming is its lack of low-end. Producer Ed Buller chose to highlight the vocals, guitar, and synths over the band's formidable rhythm section, a decision that unfortunately leaves the album's roughly 50/50 mix of bouncy pop songs and melancholy ballads sounding a little thin. <i>Coming Up</i> is still a very good album, though. Anderson's lyrics are considerably more superficial and humorous than they had been in the past; this would eventually become a problem, but on uptempo, fluorescent rock songs like ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqovGKdgAXY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beautiful Ones</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PdKGDMhau4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trash</a>"" it works because these songs are just so damned catchy. And there is a lot of depth in the ballads. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoDivCGk14E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">By the Sea</a>"", actually written by Anderson during the Butler years, is simply beautiful and heartbreaking, while ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEWn0aVcuSM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Saturday Night</a>"" works perfectly as a long exhalation at the end of the album's long and disorienting party.</p>
<p>The album is reissued with all of its contemporary B-sides, minus the Neil Codling demo ""Digging a Hole"", which is omitted without explanation. This is very important, because there's a whole second album on disc two that's easily as good as <i>Coming Up</i> itself. The epic slash of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGRxJZesNLM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Every Monday Morning Comes</a>"", the relentless dub stomp of ""WSD"", the grinding descent into debauchery of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlt85hJNyoI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Europe Is Our Playground</a>"", the exhilarating pop rush of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsF5p4fRUFY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sound of the Streets</a>"" and Anderson's baritone-voiced lead on the scuzzy, <i>Dog Man Star</i>-ish rock song ""Have You Ever Been This Low?"" are all essential to understanding just how versatile this band was at this point in its career, and that's just a sampling of the 19 B-sides included on this set. This is an important theme of this reissue campaign, and one that will become even more important later.</p>
<p>The huge success of <i>Coming Up</i> left Suede in a position to do basically anything they wanted with their next album, but it took three years for the band to put together the follow-up. Codling was at times bed-ridden with chronic fatigue syndrome after the grueling 18-month world tour in support of <i>Coming Up</i>, and Anderson had fallen deeper into drug addiction, especially crack. Bassist Mat Osman, who along with Simon Gilbert has always been a source of stability and reason for the band, recalls Anderson's drug buddies hanging around a lot during the sessions and generally ruining the atmosphere. The UK music press interpreted the long wait between albums as a sign that things were going wrong and that the next LP might be another <i>Dog Man Star.</i> When <i>Head Music</i> finally came out in 1999, anticipation was so high in Britain that Virgin Megastores all over the country changed their name to Head Music for a day on the release date.</p>
<p>The album wasn't another <i>Dog Man Star</i>, but it was considerably darker and thornier than <i>Coming Up</i>. The band worked with producer Steve Osbourne to get a much heavier, more groove-oriented sound, and Codling's synths moved to the center of the sound. <i>Head Music</i> is neon to <i>Coming Up</i>'s day-glo, and it's aged well sonically-- it is easily the band's most underappreciated album. Part of the reason for that is Anderson's lyrics, which on certain songs were simply terrible. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TxbME3fdBg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Savoir Faire</a>""'s notorious opening couplet, ""She live in a house/ She stupid as a mouse,"" is the worst offender, but the slide toward superficiality that began on <i>Coming Up</i> accelerated here, with Anderson sounding more like a bored observer than participant in the nightlife he sings about.</p>

Still, <i>A New Morning</i> is not a bad record, and it sent the band out on a hopeful note that was strikingly at odds with much of what had preceded it.</p>
<p>The five-piece Anderson/Codling/Gilbert/Oakes/Osman version of Suede has reunited and is touring, and a few years ago Anderson and Butler reconciled and made an album together as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8295-here-come-the-tears/"" target=""_blank"">the Tears</a>. Anderson has a budding solo career but has left the door open to a possible Suede album sometime in the future. If it never happens, so be it-- the band's legacy is already sealed. These three albums, and <i>Coming Up</i> in particular, show a band that picked itself up remained creative and worthy in the wake of what could have been a fatal loss. These releases give us that whole run in all its messy imperfection.</p></div>"|15571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15571-coming-up-deluxe-edition-head-music-deluxe-edition-a-new-morning-deluxe-edition/|7.0|Joe Tangari

In the wrong hands, this music could feel labored or overstuffed, but thanks to the makeshift orchestra's shaggy ringleader, Jesse  Tabish, these wistful Americana-styled tracks (influenced by Tabish  favorites <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"" target=""_blank"">Sigur Rós</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"" target=""_blank"">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a>)  rarely feel forced. Instead of the big studio sound of their self-titled debut, <i>Tamer Animals</i> feels organic and lovingly crafted, a record whose lushness often invites you to simply collapse into it.</p>
<p>Other Lives fits nicely with the pastoral richness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5653-fleet-foxes/"" target=""_blank"">Fleet Foxes</a> (whose influence is felt in the vocal harmony arrangements here) and the elegantly wasted music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"" target=""_blank"">Kurt Vile</a>. On ""Landforms"", crestfallen strings swell with Tabish  singing about the ""oceans and plains,"" and you can almost taste the  salted air. The dark, hymn-like ""Weather"" is similarly visual, but  prophetic and baleful. ""The sun is getting closer to the world,"" sings  Tabish, clearly not talking about soaking up rays.</p>
<p>Tabish has enlisted  a group of players that holds these intricate pieces in place. It's not  as if the songs here feel heavy or overloaded-- in fact, most of them are positively buoyant, thanks to the richly colored interplay of all the instruments and the spacious production. Nearly every member pulls double and triple duty on cellos,  violins, clarinets, keys, trumpets, and drums, and in a live setting,  the band constantly shifts and repositions to hit every  mark. On record, these professional assets come through even  stronger.</p>
<p>Still,<i> Tamer Animals</i> isn't without its flaws, the quality of the vocals chief among them. For something so painstakingly made,  it's strange that most vocal takes-- including some of those terrific  harmonies-- sound oddly flattened. On an album about  leaving behind the things you love, this seems like one element Other  Lives should've made more of an effort with, as the pained stoicism in  Tabish's voice doesn't always match the grandiosity of the music.</p>
<p>But that grandiosity makes it feel as if Other Lives are coming from a million different directions at once. ""Old Statues"" has the whispery  endlessness of a spaghetti western soundtrack; the string draws nicked  from Radiohead's ""How to Disappear Completely"" impart a deeply haunted  vibe to the provincial lope of ""For 12""; ""Woodwind"" channels the  magical spook of a Grimm fairytale. Even if the emotional intent often feels recycled from other records, <i>Tamer Animals</i> is a record that takes you places.</p></div>"|15545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15545-tamer-animals/|7.4|Zach Kelly

It's really as simple as that. I really wanted people to see Bellafea especially. I think you don't see a stage presence like Heather McEntire's more than a few times in your life. She's unbelievable."" Five years later, Bellafea's fate is unknown-- it's unclear whether they're on indefinite hiatus or broken up permanently-- but McEntire's charisma comes through strong and clear in her new act, <a href=""http://www.mountmoriahband.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mount Moriah</a>, which she formed with guitarist Jenks Miller of Horseback. While Bellafea derived its sound from spartan postpunk experimentalism, Mount Moriah explores more traditional folk, country, and gospel sounds. Those are, of course, the hallmarks of the bustling North Carolina scene-- one of the most interesting and active in the country right now-- but this new sound is a perfect setting for McEntire, whose voice suggests the expressiveness of Dolly Parton, the forcefulness of Carole King, and the textured restraint of Emmylou Harris.</p>
<p>That voice is the ideal conduit for McEntire's lyrics-- or perhaps the lyrics are the ideal vehicle for her voice. She writes in a direct style that manages to incorporate interesting turns of phrase, knotty combinations of words, and evocative imagery. ""Social Wedding Rings"" deftly dissects circle-of-friends politics, neither lambasting nor condoning those interrelationships but finding a finer balance between fond remembrance and bitter regret. Even singing about hanging out in Colorado Springs and listening to Buffy Sainte-Marie, she's makes the song specific to her own experience yet sympathetic enough to apply to any listener. On ""Lament"", McEntire slyly subverts love-song conventions to write a declaration of love's opposite: ""A mouthful of bees couldn't stop me from whisperin', 'I don't love you,'"" she sings with a steeliness in her phrasing, right before the handclaps come in. Her repulsion is just as intense and wild as the attraction and excitement of first love.</p>
<p>Dominated by shuffling drums, slow southern rock guitar licks, and pedal steel, the music on <i>Mount Moriah</i> is unobtrusive and reserved-- at times almost too much so-- but there are some fine flourishes in these songs, which feature members of Megafaun, St. Vincent, and Bowerbirds. The strings on ""Old Gowns"" quiver and sob, as if allowing McEntire to maintain her composure, and Miller's steady, chiming guitar theme on ""Lament"" gives her something to lean on. The music isn't as distinctive as the singer, but the band's mission is to support, not compete with, her performance. The accompaniment is understated by necessity, because what else can you do when the album's finest moment is McEntire singing wordlessly and eloquently on ""Old Gowns"", sustaining a single syllable to show the full, gorgeous grain of her voice?</p></div>"|15574.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15574-mount-moriah/|7.8|Stephen M.

With Cliffie Swan, the pair-- alongside Alana Amram, and, on tour, with Erika Spring and Hannah Rawe-- have nixed much of the bend-over-backwards genre-melding of their previous work, paring down Lights' wide-ranging, whiplash-inducing influences to a more manageable shortlist while playing up their considerable way with hooks. <i>Memories Come True</i>, their debut as Cliffie Swan, matches patient 70s style power-pop with hints of sleek, Ric Ocasek-indebted 80s sheen and slack, rangy 90s rock; a mix less heady than their old band's, perhaps, but even more deftly handed.</p>
<p>The ramshackle riff singer-guitarist Knapp gives ""Dream Chain"", a sunkissed little groover about making eyes at a show, all but tumbles out of the speaker, whereupon she musters a lovely, easygoing vocal. Knapp's clear, cool voice seems absolutely at ease over the low-key tangle of her guitar turnarounds; never the showiest singer, these softer, more spacious songs are a far better fit for her warm, laid-back style than the histrionic hard-rock dalliances on <i>Rites</i>. <i>Memories</i>' first three songs prove its most immediately ingratiating; after ""Chain"", the husky ""Soft and Mean"" gets a little snarl going-- Knapp's cooly delivered kiss-off of, ""you know, your attitude, it really wrecks my mood,"" cuts to the quick-- and the Cars-like ""Yes I Love You"" strips things back so far the hook can't help but jut out. They may be making fewer moves on these lean, chorus-heavy tunes than they did flitting between styles on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13321-rites/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rites</i></a>, but they seem more confident in each one.</p>
<p><i>Memories</i>' title track beings as a dirge-y, downtrodden flute-driven psych-rocker until its chorus turns lovely and languid; ""Full of Pain"" sounds more than a little like a Stevie Nicks tune until Knapp's scuzzy guitar snakes its way into the frame. <i>Memories</i>' midsection is its most psychedelic, with lighter-flicker ""California Baby"" taking on the sludgy metal that occasionally snuck its way onto <i>Rites</i>. Just as the disc's knotty pop lead-in often calls to mind Fleetwood Mac  without ever quite going full McVie, there's something about this mid-LP  mix of vocal serenity and bleary guitar crunch that suggests they've  been rummaging around in the mid-90s buzzbin. But they've gotten so good  at couching even their more obvious influences in threads of ambling  melody that any easy comparisons seem somehow beside the point. That's a  big shift from <i>Rites</i>, an album that seemed most impressive for the  derring-do of its genre-stacking. Echoes of everything from the Breeders  to Black Sabbath may ring throughout <i>Memories</i> now and again, but  there's a serenity and self-possession driving these tunes that isn't on  loan from any other band.</p>
<p>The chanty ""Home"" throws another curveball before the fluttery, harmony-driven ""She's Almost Gone"" twirls in. The track's light-as-a-breeze melody threatens to blow away before Knapp throws a bit of guitar boogie underneath it; as with Lights, Cliffie are constantly tucking little bits of melody into the pockets of their tunes, and while there's less zig-zagging in these arrangements, their melodies still seem to dodge the obvious move. While sturdy, the album's final three-fer-- slow burner ""Take It Easy"", the gossamer ""<a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/system/tracks/downloads/4756/original/1-10_So_Long.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">So Long</a>"", and the Pretenders-esque closer ""Climb on Top""-- proves a bit less satisfying than the killer trio that opens the record and the swirly stuff in its center. But the pair has gotten rather good at jamming out deceptively direct, harder-to-place pop-rockers, and while <i>Memories</i> doesn't exactly end with a bang, it's hardly a whimper, either. Those who fell for Lights' anything-goes genre eradications may feel a bit shortchanged by the relative simplicity of the easygoing <i>Memories</i>, and fans of pure pop may find these low-key hooks a bit too low-impact. But while Cliffie Swan's airy melodic excursions might be several degrees less daring than Lights' exploratory pop-psych, it's both easier to like and easier to grok. And, hey, no whiplash.</p></div>"|15573.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15573-memories-come-true/|7.3|Paul Thompson

France's Justice and their blog-house followers took peak-hour rave rock to its breaking point and left it limping by the side of the road. Electronic dance music cycled back through more traditional and frequently more mellow strains of disco and house. And everyone more or less stopped talking about once hopelessly hot labels like Ed Banger and <span>Kitsuné</span>.</p>
<p>All of which actually leaves the Hamburg duo poised for a big second act.<i> Idealism </i>showed clear pop aspirations, from the Cure-repurposing of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_6Tmpqp3c4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Digitalism in Cairo</a>"" to the streamlined vocal number ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw4J0Go_4rg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pogo</a>"". With thumping house beats still a big pop presence, now might be as good a time as any to realize such a crossover. But <i>I Love You,</i> <i>Dude</i> doesn't shake off the confines of genre to reveal a shiny new pop act underneath. Nor does it meaningfully improve on Digitalism's previous formulas.</p>
<p>Instead, <i>Dude</i> is a mere rehash, as its title's similarity to 2009 Paul Rudd-Jason Segel bromance <i>I Love You, Man</i>, would suggest. Lead single ""Blitz"", with its filtered, circling synth lead, effectively recreates some of the glitzy appeal of <i>Idealism</i>'s ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKKWXmKebwk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zdarlight</a>"", but with no moment quite as catchy as that song's effervescent guitar break. ""Antibiotics"" sort of recalls Tiga's Soulwax collab ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydFPpuGAbmw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">What You Need</a>"", with its pitched-down exhortations giving way to jabbing drum machines and distorted synth. Neither track is more essential than its predecessors.</p>
<p>The songs that go for the pop jugular don't have much better luck. ""2 Hearts"", with its eighth-note keyboard builds and buzzing, sidelong synth stabs, comes off like a pale echo of Phoenix's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL548cHH3OY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1901</a>"". The album's collaboration with the Strokes' Julian Casablancas is a slight improvement, its chorus rising almost gracefully out of its dull lumbering verses. But if naming your album <i>I Love You, Dude</i> is perhaps guileless, then what would you call having Casablancas sing the chorus (""And so you run,"" he yelps) and then calling the track ""Forrest Gump"" (because, you know, Forrest <i>ran</i>)?</p>
<p>The rest of the album is one undistinguished track after another of grinding, growling synths and digitally clipped drum machines, from the impotent fanfare of ""Stratosphere"" to to the distorted plod of ""Miami Showdown"". There's a reason that, a single here or there aside, the Hype Machine hive mind collectively burned out on blog-house, and it's that all the super-compressed synth noise just gets to be physically exhausting to take in after a while, whether over the course of a club night or a long-playing album.</p></div>"|15562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15562-i-love-you-dude/|4.4|Eric Grandy

Thus far, World Unite Lucifer Youth Foundation have taken equal inspiration from <i>A Clockwork Orange </i>and fellow Mancunians Happy Mondays to play out that adolescent fantasy of having every bird-flip <i>rewarded </i>by  authority figures they're meant to offend. The British rags will help  you fill in the rest, but here are a few talking points: getting a cold  call from Michel Gondry only to ignore it; charging desperate A&amp;R's  50 pounds for a demo; telling the UK press to fuck off, only to have  them respond with statements like, ""they're reinventing the wheel."" Their web presence is so cryptic, they make <a href=""http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dead Air Space</a> look like Lil B's Twitter feed.  The band's incomprehensible frontman, Ellery Roberts, is an experiment  in rock vocal abstraction, and yet sold-out crowds sing along to every  proto-linguistic grunt. But the centerpiece of <i>Go Tell Fire to the Mountain--</i> a stunning lockstep of drum rolls, tart guitar chords, and a maddening  chant for raising beers and clenched fists-- makes it clear: This is  life-affirming music, repulsed by hype and cynicism. The name of the  song? ""We Bros"".</p>
<p>The first word of the title is the important thing: <i>Go Tell Fire </i>celebrates togetherness.  Approach the record with no context whatsoever, and it's fairly trad  indie rock for crescendo junkies that could be laid over just about  anything-- a stirring football highlight, your morning commute-- for  instant widescreen effect. Dissatisfied with the sound they were getting  in traditional studios, WU LYF self-produced in an abandoned church,  which could once again be sniffed at as another publicity stunt. But  they needed every bit of open airspace to capture their sound in full,  and the building itself acts as an active participant. Silvery, melodic  guitar lines are given extra dimension with decay and release, and a  pipe organ draws lengthy sustain. And man, what it does for the  percussion: the term ""crash cymbal"" has rarely sounded so literal, and a  critical mass of reverb pushes the kick drum's natural tone to its  limit on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12213-dirt/"" target=""_blank"">Dirt</a>"" and ""14 Crowns For Me &amp; Your Friends"".</p>
<p>But underneath all that bouncing room echo, you hear a band trying to  live up to its own hype, unglamorously woodshedding until every  arrangement was tight as hell. It's danceable in the same way older  Modest Mouse is-- a sweet spot that feels more limber than rock and too  jittery to congeal into a groove like funk, but always in the service of  some sort of physicality. Even the ballads rarely feel settled: The  opening piano chords of ""Concrete Gold"" echo around a kick drum beat,  before a call-and-response chorus that evokes the melodicism of D.C.  hardcore.</p>
<p>So while musically it connects the divergent anthem-fashioning of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky/"" target=""_blank""> Explosions in the Sky</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4660-wolf-parade/"" target=""_blank"">Wolf Parade</a>, Roberts' vocals evade just about  any facile comparison. Attempts to classify it have ranged from Captain  Beefheart to a variety of feral animals or malfunctioning household  appliances, all making the same point, more or less: this is a trial by  fire. He's screaming ""I love you forever!"" on the first track (""L Y F"")  while revealing an alternate translation for their band name, yet in the  urgency of Roberts' voice, you can see the matted fur and gnarled teeth  of an endearingly ugly stray that you're still hesitant to love back  (see also: his performance on the aptly titled military funeral march  ""Such a Sad Puppy Dog"").</p>
<p>And yet, similar to the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28494-jonsi/"" target=""_blank"">Jónsi</a> applied the rhythms and  phonetics of Hopelandic to convey an immutable, beatific divinity,  Roberts lives within WU LYF's musical viscera as a vocal embodiment of  animal instinct, projecting from the primitive part of the brain that  can sense danger and react before it even acknowledges the source. You  can occasionally make out his marching orders on ""Cave Song"" and ""Dirt"",  but Roberts and WU LYF match up spasm for spasm to make  their point clear: keep your head on a swivel, move. <i>Do something</i>.  WU LYF bark out the title of ""Spitting Blood"" repeatedly over heraldic  organ, and it's an evocative image leaving its completion up to the  listener. On the chorus, Ellerby and crew yell ""we are so happy! Happy to see...,"" the intelligibility fittingly cutting off right there.  After all, what is<i> </i>the phrase <i>Go Tell Fire to the Mountain </i>besides an open-ended call to arms?</p>
<p>Closer ""Heavy Pop"" might be the only time WU LYF actively and clearly  suggest what they're getting at (indeed, a dispatch on the band's  mailing list describes the album as ""10 tracks of true heavy pop""). But <i>Go Tell Fire </i>rarely  scans as ""pop music,"" and at times, it's content to give into pure  texture and drift. Rather, this ""heavy pop"" translates to me as populism  of real heft. More artistically rewarding <i>records</i> have been made  this year, but when I think about WU LYF in the manner of Iceage or Odd  Future as musicians that have made me genuinely excited about their  potential impact on listeners, the same things that make them seem  juvenile-- the artistic and personal volatility, the semblance  of a roving gang more than a band, the invitation to indulge in your most  disturbing impulses and yet feel morally superior to an ill-defined  majority-- are the same things that feel totally galvanizing. And it's  easy to imagine <i>Go</i> <i>Tell Fire to the Mountain </i>giving  disaffected listeners the promise of an entry to something beyond  themselves in a way that James Blake or Bon Iver can't. Maybe you've  grown past that sort of thing, but what about a record of exhilarating  expanse and passion that sounds like indie rock and yet <i>feels </i>way bigger? Well, <i>Go Tell Fire to the Mountain </i>is that too.</p></div>"|15567.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15567-go-tell-fire-to-the-mountain/|8.4|Ian Cohen

Given the song's hazy production--<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD_DyoB4Cjs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steely Dan's ""Midnight Cruiser""</a> hammered into jagged boom-bap-- the impulse to lapse into laconic stoner rap makes sense, but nothing plays out quite so predictably on <i>Digital Lows</i>.</p>
<p>And so, in a drunken RZA-like flow, the Memphis rapper narrates his heroic origin story (""Bluff City born with a mic in my palm, I came up out the womb spittin' in the rarest of form""), hilariously big-ups himself (""In this 8-bit world I'm Bowser""), and mockingly croons the song's shit-talk title. Even the usual hip-hop clichés are afforded specificity thanks to his expressive wit and precise determination not to use words in the same exact way as every other rapper. He describes the girls he's pulling in by joking, ""as a youngin' jerkin' off I could never picture this,"" and refers to his haters as ""voyeurs.""</p>
<p>Dude's got personality. He's a conflicted, searching thinker, with an outsider/insider perspective that merges the personal and the political, and lashes-out against the street mentality that mocks his forward-thinking hip-hop. ""Niggas say I dress white,"" he observes a little hurt, and retorts, ""flow must be cocaine."" He also makes a joke about ""white bitches"" whose ""favorite band is Mr. Bungle,"" which is just really funny. A few years ago this would be derisively called ""hipster rap,"" but that kind of categorical thinking has been pleasantly deconstructed by now.</p>
<p><i>Digital Lows</i> also has a group of out-of-nowhere, brilliant producers (Muted Drone, RPLD GHOSTS, Danny Dee, and others) behind it, all of whom contribute imaginative but still traditionalist beats. ""Black Box"" gives <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcHOq8i5Pyk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gil Scott-Heron's ""Winter in America""</a> a blunted beatmaker refix. ""Die Young"" loops the intro to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzGnX-MbYE4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode's ""People Are People""</a> and turns the new wave classic into a hybrid of Rammellzee's avant-rap and Southern fight-rap. Three 6 Mafia's subtle influence on this next-generation Memphis rapper always manifests itself in subtle, indirect ways like that. ""A Beautiful Hell"", ""Doom x Gloom"", and ""sixsixsixes"" invoke Three 6 shock rap at moments when Cities, usually thoughtful and witty, sounds at the end of his rope, far beyond ""fuck it""-- so he lets loose with lines like, ""we fuck broads on the cross and they gulp the semen.""</p>
<p>For contrast, placed between ""Doom x Gloom"" and ""sixsixsixes"" is ""Meet Me on Montrose (For Ex-Lovers Only)"", a bittersweet love story based on a sample of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIFeq4x_2Xc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Oh Lori"" by the Alessi Brothers</a>, which is quite possibly the least ""hard"" song ever made.

Not only did the UK producer known as Forest Swords release the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14397-dagger-paths/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dagger Paths </i>EP</a><span> (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14903-dagger-paths-expanded-edition/"" target=""_blank"">twice</a>), he was able to spend a whole year watching adventurous music fans slowly come around to his vision. What initially sounded like the dubby musings of a post-rock acolyte eventually revealed themselves to be much more: treatises on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7886-new-vocabulary/"" target=""_blank"">voice and memory</a>, half-remembered R&amp;B, and haunting guitars. The reissued </span><i>Dagger Paths</i><span> included six early Forest Swords tracks, which the </span><i>Fjree Feather</i> EP repackages (yes, again), with proceeds now going to Red Cross tsunami relief.</p>
<p>This pre-<i>Dagger Paths</i> work shows that while Barnes' vision was already mostly developed, his toolbox was noticeably lighter. The six tracks here rely almost uniformly on slow, powerful drumming and a thick guitar assault that has way more in common with, say, early Flying Saucer Attack or Codeine than, well, Timbaland or Four Tet, whom <i>Dagger Paths</i> at its best could evoke. Barnes works in layers, his tones distorted but his pace measured. <i>Fjree Feather</i> sounds sinister as a result, churning over into psychedelic sludge and back again.</p>
<p>Even in these early recordings, Barnes' style is distinct: ""Bones"" is, structurally, a metal song, with its bass lapping up against its plodding drums. But everything is thin-- that bass has no depth, those drums no oomph-- as if it's being played underwater. <i>Dagger Paths</i> was notable for its use of sampled, garbled voices. <i>Fjree Feather </i>features just the barest hints of that. ""Trust Your Blood"", the most forward-thinking track here, trades quasi-tribal chants with peals of electric guitar, its rhythms resisting the urge to putter to a stop.</p>
<p><i>Fjree Feather</i><span> finds a nice middle ground; it's sometimes a well-executed leftfield guitar album and other times a primer for the ghostly lean-tos on </span><i>Dagger Paths</i><span>. But Barnes is most exciting for where he might be going, not necessarily where he's been. With Forest Swords' back catalog presumably now exhausted, we can return to awaiting his next move.</span></p></div>"|15541.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15541-fjree-feather/|6.5|Andrew Gaerig

The New York space-rock explorers have stamped their name on more than a dozen releases from about half as many labels in the past six years. But they're at their best onstage, where they're loud, exhilarating, and unhinged, playing strings of songs as long as most bands' full sets. Though they're generally that way on record, too, I've never gotten the same feeling from White Hills through my own stereo speakers as I have through some bar's PA.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The same holds for <i>H–p1</i>, a 72-minute, nine-track album that's often invigorating but sometimes just seems endless. White Hills are at their best when they're at their busiest, as on the closing, 17-minute title track, with misanthropic lyrics, a jagged riff, and expansive solos. It's complicated and exhausting, but it succeeds through sheer momentum. Moments like these make the band's second album for Thrill Jockey worth at least one trip. Similarly, ""The Condition of Nothing"" is a moody anthem with a squealing, instrumental midsection; it's nasty and noisy, a passage that a band with less of a filter might have omitted. Meanwhile, ""Monument"" evokes claustrophobia through power electronics and stacked, broken rhythms. It's intensity is compelling.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But that lack of restraint cuts both ways. Elsewhere, White Hills include entire experimental sections that would have been better left in the practice room. Synthesizer study ""Hand in Hand"" is a jam with little movement, an exercise without an idea. ""No Other Way"" rumbles quickly to a doomy churn, with Ego Sensation's bulbous bass tone serving as ballast for Dave W.'s guitar and synthesizer builds, but then it spends its last three minutes whirring and droning through an Amon Düül II haze. It seems like an attempt to make an art-rock statement, but it mostly just thwarts the trio's thrust. Similar tones work much better during ""Paradise"", a krautrock heater (assisted by Oneida drummer Kid Millions) that lets up only in the last of its 13 minutes; by then, it's actually time for the band to exhale.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite White Hills' plentiful output, pacing remains a problem for the group. Live, as they run marathons around a riff, that's less of an issue; you're surrounded in the moment, lost in the feeling. On <i>H–p1</i>, though, it means you spend half of your time waiting to reach the crest.</p></div>"|15559.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15559-hp1/|6.8|Grayson Currin

One of the partners in the firm that represented him during the proceedings was Jerry Masucci. Pacheco was a bandleader; born in the Dominican Republic, he moved to New York with his parents when he was 11, studied percussion at Julliard, and started his own band in 1960. With this band, he was working on a fusion of all the Caribbean styles that could be heard in New York at that time, bringing together the related traditions of Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Cuban music to plant some of the seeds that became salsa. Pacheco and Masucci formed a much deeper connection than the average lawyer-client bond, and in 1964, they founded the Fania label, initially selling records out of the trunk of a car in Spanish Harlem.</p>
<p>Pacheco and Masucci signed many of the brightest young lights on the New York Latin scene, and over the next 15 years, the label became essentially synonymous with the emerging salsa movement. Pacheco was the label's house producer and from 1968, led the Fania All Stars, a supergroup of some of the label's best musicians. But Masucci was more than just the business end of things. He attended sessions, bought lunch for the musicians, and with his brother Alex, encouraged the development of the music. Strut's new Fania compilation documents that development over two packed discs, with key tracks by Willie Colón, Rub<span>é</span>n Blades, H<span>é</span>ctor Lavoe, the Fania All Stars, Celia Cruz, Ray Barretto, Mongo Santamaria, Joe Bataan, and others.</p>
<p>It's a good introduction to the Fania sound and stable of artists, steering refreshingly clear of songs where the funk beat has taken over. In fact, one of the central tensions of this music is the way the musicians work to incorporate some of the groove of funk without surrendering their own rhythmic heritage. Caribbean music (and much other Latin American music as well) is built on a very different concept of rhythm and harmony than most North American music. The African elements of North American music come to it less directly than the African elements of Caribbean music, which were preserved more strongly. Where rock, R&amp;B, funk, soul, and even classical music tend to think in terms of a beat or pulse that is determined separately from the key the song is in, Caribbean music is constructed around a different rhythmic concept called the clave, which covers both the rhythmic drive and tonality of the music.</p>
<p>So you'll hear plenty of cycling, hypnotic piano figures, locked in with simple bass lines, underpinning these songs, while an arsenal of percussion defines and accents the different parts of the rhythm. It gives even the slowest, mellowest songs an undeniable momentum, as one bar pours effortlessly into the next, with vocals and horns syncopated on top. Most of the songs are sung in Spanish, though there are exceptions. Fania artists tended to be bilingual, with Caribbean heritage and American upbringing, but frankly, Spanish is the language better suited to the music.</p>
<p>A substantial jazz influence can be heard in some of the playing as well-- check Willie Colón's nicely phrases trombone solo on ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J52kwS6WWAc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Hustler</a>"", or the way Ray Barretto's swirling ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgR-OnK_zig&amp;feature=fvst"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Indestructible</a>"" seamlessly builds the clave around a series of jazz chord progressions. Mongo Santamaria's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR1WYUmW448"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">O Mi Shango</a>"", by contrast, displays a heavy Afrobeat influence and rides a drum kit that plays with a sort of proto-disco accent on the upbeats. But that's the exception. For the most part, this set functions as an ace introduction to salsa music in all its brassy, undulating glory.</p></div>"|15564.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15564-fania-records-1964-1980-the-original-sound-of-latin-new-york/|8.0|Joe Tangari

But until recently, most discussion of <a href=""http://www.unknownmortalorchestra.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Unknown Mortal Orchestra</a> understandably went from lauding the unshakeable hooks of ""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/Unknown%20Mortal%20Orchestra%20-%20Ffunny%20Ffrends.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Ffunny Ffriends</a>"" and ""How Can You Luv Me?"" to wondering why, true to their name, they remained anonymous. Protracted mystery can cause as much skepticism as the most overt press blitz, and information had been scarce since they popped up last year with a <a href=""http://unknown-mortal-orchestra.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a> page of intriguing and untraceable songs. Some time after, those songs started being performed live by human beings who do mundane things like wear Baja drug rugs, live in Portland, and maintain an active Twitter feed. But there's still something eerily extraterrestrial about their debut LP, as if it were something that fell from the sky completely intact. You wonder if it might be an artifact from some psych-rock acid casualty, a long-forgotten Kiwi-popper, or an Elephant 6 offshoot. You want to poke at it, prod it, and try to carbon date it.</p>
<p>None of the ambiguity would matter if <i>UMO</i> didn't spring to life from the first happily bopping seconds of ""Ffunny Ffriends"" and provide a half hour of rich analog sizzle that extends far beyond its meager recording budget (seriously, try and find it on vinyl, if possible). Though obviously more camera shy than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28390-sleigh-bells/"" target=""_blank"">Sleigh Bells</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28665-cults/"" target=""_blank"">Cults</a>, UMO represents a similar merger of simple and catchy melodies lovingly marooned in a raw, buzzcut production that puts an emphasis on the beats. The major difference for UMO is that their grit radiates from the inside out. Funk too often comes off as a jittery affectation or genre exercise even for rock bands who are pretty good at it. But for bandleader Ruban Nielson, it feels like a natural songwriting mode. The tortured but deceptively joyous hook from ""How Can You Luv Me?"" does plenty to draw you in, to the point where it might take the fifth listen to focus on just how limber the rhythm section is. It's hardly alone in sounding like a readymade breakbeat, so it's not surprising that the cratedigging likes of <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/therealelp/status/78902997651951616"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">El-P</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/questlove/status/62696188889153536"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">?uestlove</a>, and <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/HEEMS/status/62701157713326080"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Das Racist</a> have all taken to tweeting UMO's praises.</p>
<p>But the sound wouldn't matter without songwriting. When a singer gets praised for incorporating his or her voice like another instrument in the mix, it's usually a reference to texture. And while Nielson often works in an androgynous, bristling tone that's certainly ingratiating on its own merits, it's more remarkable for its sophisticated approach to melody. Whether gripping the thrilling hairpin turns of ""Bicycle"", arranging complex lattices of syncopation on ""Thought Ballune"", or simply doubling down on his own leads on ""Ffunny Ffriends"", he converses with the inventive guitar playing like he's making a sales pitch. The riffs tell you what you're gonna hear, the vocals respond, and they link up in a way that makes everything so welcoming and familiar by the middle of the song itself. Combined with an expert use of space rare for such a lo-fi record, <i>UMO</i> manages a unique immersive and psychedelic quality without relying on the usual array of bong-ripping effects.</p>
<p>As with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14251-treats/"" target=""_blank""><i>Treats</i></a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15432-cults/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cults</i></a>, it's easy to view the band's ability to do just a few things very well as a potential liability. But many of UMO's charms come while they jab at their limitations. ""Little Blu House"" dots its airy landscape with harmonies that seem to change color with each stacked layer, and closer ""Boy Witch"" indulges in some intriguing post-punk guitar damage that could indicate a future direction. That said, the track stuffed with the most experimentation ends up being the weakest. ""Nerve Damage"" is part envelope filter-hotdogging and part goony thrash, but pretty much all filler, ultimately. But hell, being able to recognize Unknown Mortal Orchestra's imperfection, however minor, lends their debut some humanity. As does being able to see a press photo of the shaggy but high-functioning space cadets who made it.</p></div>"|15539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15539-unknown-mortal-orchestra/|8.1|Ian Cohen

Although Pritchard's production shares way more in common with Californian beat-makers Flying Lotus and Daedalus, there's a fidgety energy at the core of his debut album, <i>Limerence</i>, that aligns itself with small town boredom and restlessness.</p>
<p>""Sacré Cool"" emerged last year and still sounds fresh and vital, with its low-end pumping against a wonky beat culled from Chemise's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKoBpDM9S8c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">She Can't Love You</a>"". Pritchard's retooling of that sample is full of left turns as he pulls the beat this way and that, but still keeps enough of a solid centre to nod along to.  Indeed, no matter how deeply Young Montana dives into noodly, intricate production on <i>Limerence</i>, there's still a party edge propping things up.</p>
<p>Most of the record drips pretty heavily with the influence of beatmakers like FlyLo, Madlib, and Prefuse 73 but there are some nicely unexpected nods in Pritchard's production too. The start of ""Mynnd"" errs towards the type of glacial, icy sound of Boards of Canada as analog-sounding synths sprawl on top of each other before being overtaken by typically skronking beat.</p>
<p>With grimey synths and a swarm of exaggerated sounds, ""Legwrap"" is probably the most uncompromising production on the record. Propelled along by a clattering beat, a collection of outré sounds jostle for attention in the mix. The rattle of drums eventually falls in on itself, giving way to a stark, wobbly synth interlude. It's an example of pretty meticulous beat-mapping and might be a bit alienating if not for a gorgeous end section that Pritchard ushers in out of nowhere. The passage recalls Prefuse 73 at his <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsoQO41Hcuc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">more playful</a> with a smooth soul sample chopped and spliced with subtle horns and cut-up vocals.</p>
<p>The sudden change in direction at the end of ""Legwrap"" is something Montana pulls on quite a few of these tracks, lending the whole record the feel of an endlessly tuning radio, flickering from station to station. It adds a kind of broken, wonky dynamic that makes things feel slightly intangible. But occasionally these interludes add an interesting context to beats just at the moment they almost lose steam. Take ""Midnight Snacks"" for instance, a track that pumps with robotic, destroyed threads and a concealed vocal sample repeating, ""Can't take my eyes off you,"" until late on when Montana flips things again, delivering the sample back to its original old-timey roots.</p>
<p>Moments like that, while not exactly groundbreaking, are nice touches that contribute to the overall sense of careful craft that exemplifies Pritchard's production. While his seamlessly stitched-together beats aren't quite as meticulous or obsessively compulsive as something like Prefuse 73's glitch-hop epic <i><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUTEd3OmIK0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">One Word Extinguisher</a></i> for instance, there's still an impressive attention to detail. His thorough and restless production helps Pritchard transcend the efforts of many other bedroom producers by sheer virtue of his work ethic. Coming from a town like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVwPW5OzYO4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Coventry</a>, one imagines you have to make your own fun, and that's exactly what Young Montana does on <i>Limerence</i>.</p></div>"|15560.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15560-limerence/|7.5|Hari Ashurst

This art-folk group, comprised of recent Bennington grads (including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28236-mountain-man/"" target=""_blank"">Mountain Man</a>'s Amelia Randall Meath), are fascinated by opposites and negatives, by the sharp disparities between ambient and rhythmic, airy and earthy, restive and tranquil, male and female. For their self-titled debut, the circle of friends holed up in a tiny Massachusetts hamlet to arrange these dozen songs (most written by de facto frontman Tom Greenberg), then recorded them in Woodstock, New York. Spacier and less Americana-based than those settings might suggest, the result is an intriguing marriage of familiar sounds in new settings, sounding variously like a nodding-off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom/"" target=""_blank"">Joanna Newsom</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27618-tune-yards/"" target=""_blank"">tUnE-yArDs</a> with the caps toggle off.</p>
<p>BOBBY's songs float loose and untethered, occasionally nudged along by percolating percussion. The contrast between drift and momentum are intriguing, especially on ""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/Bobby%20-%20Sore%20Spores.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Sore Spores</a>"", which pits an emphatic female vocal on the verses with a smoother, slyer male vocal on the chorus. The transition between them is intentionally jarring, suggesting a he said/she said account of a relationship. With its sleepy-eyed bassline and whispers of guitar, ""Nap Champ"" lives up to its title, then rouses itself, upping the tempos and setting the guitars on high shimmer. Neither half would work without the other, but together they form a dynamic whole.</p>
<p>Sprawling to seven members, BOBBY take advantage of their inclusive roster by indulging many ideas, from the slightly menacing basslines to the great yawns of synths to the wordless vocal flourishes that adorn several songs. Opener ""We Saw"" knots up a melody that crescendoes with each steady repetition of its central phrases, the harmonizing voices moving against instead of with the plateauing chord changes. Few songs on <i>BOBBY </i>are quite so assertive, although the arrangements are often busy and mercurial: ""It's Dead Outside"" changes shape almost constantly, yet maintains its murky drift across seven minutes.</p>
<p>At times, the extremes are too extreme, with too much dead air abutting too many busy passages. Mid-album instrumental ""Loading Phase"" lulls <i>BOBBY</i> to sleep, while closer ""The Shed"" marries a churchly organ theme to a small chorale of voices, suggesting a cathedral in miniature-- or a shed, perhaps. The idea is more intriguing than the music itself, yet the idea is appreciated, as is the ambition to mix sounds together in subtly new ways. In that regard, BOBBY intently evoke that drowsy space between wakefulness and sleep. It's lively in its drowsiness, which may be the album's most compelling and distinguishing contrast.</p></div>"|15555.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15555-bobby/|7.2|Stephen M. Deusner

House music has been earnestly applying its wiki brainpower to this question for a couple of years now, processing decades of house and disco tropes and rendering an endless stream of variations upon the theme. Record after record aspires to the ideal type, with just the right balance of disco breaks, vintage-sounding drum machines, blocky piano chords, and suggestively yearning vocals. This goes for a lot of crappy records, but it also holds for some of the good ones, too. The debut album from Scotland's <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/6thboroughproject"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">6th Borough Project</a> feels, in many ways, like a quintessentially of-the-moment dissertation on deepness; fortunately, it falls to the worthwhile end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>I don't think that 6th Borough Project-- the duo of house producers Graeme Clark, aka the Revenge, and Craig Smith-- would dispute their role as a certain kind of revivalist (or, better, caretaker, preservationist, gene-splicer). It's right there in the introduction to ""Deep C"", where a stoned-sounding voice intones, ""Nothing is original. All human expression is really just endless variations. There are only a limited number of stories you can tell, but there's an unlimited number of ways to tell the same story.""</p>
<p>Their story is a kind of idealized version of classic, disco-infused house, chock full of soul samples as super-saturated as old Polaroids. (I realize that we used up that metaphor on chillwave, but it does beg the question: Is house music's current retro fetish a manifestation of the same rearview-yearning currently running through indie music? Possibly.) They've definitely got a certain formula down: Tracks start off demurely, with a simple boom/clap drum pattern and a bass line, maybe a flickering loop of voice or guitar; then they swell about the middle, adding layers of keyboards and carefully daubing on more samples, like horn and voices. The climax often consists of a clipped phrase unrolling itself to its full length, a pocket in time before the groove kicks back in and the track disassembles itself, piece by piece. It's music made with a DJ's sense of sequencing, which is also a way of saying that it's largely about balance. And, make no mistake, it can be thrilling, especially when they slow down and linger on the contours of their source material, luxuriating in the wobble of a drum fill or the silvery arrow of a delay chain.</p>
<p>6th Borough Project and the Revenge are often counted as adherents to a slow-mo tendency in house music (along with Mark E, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28115-john-talabot/"" target=""_blank"">John Talabot</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29422-nicolas-jaar/"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Jaar</a> and the Wolf + Lamb crew, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7602-prins-thomas/"" target=""_blank"">Prins Thomas</a> and his Internasjonal label, among others), but not everything here is quite so downbeat. Perhaps half the tracks could fit into the second hour of any dance party-- or even the 11th, depending upon the club. ""Find a Way"" is a driving filter-disco number, all jangly guitar and throaty exhortation, that could crack the cinderblocks in a basement dive; the percussive ""Iznae"" is spacious but powerful, with bass and drums that thump your sternum, sampled snares leaning forward into the beat. (The album's least typical cut, it's also one of the best.) But ""If the Feeling's Right"" and ""Deep C"" both sink into wonderfully woozy territory, with blurry disco samples and synthesizers congealing around stumbling 4/4 kicks and handclaps. With its synths and vocoders, ""Deep C"" sounds like an experiment in new wave disco, maybe with a touch of Mike Oldfield's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Mwk4NGEiNI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In High Places</a>""; ""If the Feeling's Right"" shuffles along the border between exhaustion and ecstasy, spurred on by keening vocal loops.</p>
<p>Back to nostalgia: the guys in 6th Borough Project know what they're doing. The name itself falls in line with classic house and disco monikers like Terrence Parker's Seven Grand Housing Authority and Began Cekic's Brooklyn Express; it gives off the same scent of sun-baked concrete and sweaty basements. It's not an original image of urban America, but then, nothing is original. 6th Borough Project repeat themselves sometimes, but they've got a solid grasp of the story they've chosen to tell. Somewhere, someone's writing a variation on one of their variations right now. The parts of this album where they depart from the script are enough to make me curious about how they'll respond.</p></div>"|15552.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15552-one-night-in-the-borough/|6.7|Philip Sherburne

Deusner summarized <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10880-cry-baby/"">Cry-Baby</a></i>, the album Norway's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5529-ungdomskulen/"">Ungdomskulen</a> released in 2007, by pointing out that it crammed in ""eight long songs with as many digressions, tangents, and asides as possible."" Anyone deterred by such extravagance may find something more palatable to chew on in <i>Gimme Ten</i>. But this is indulgence of a different kind. Here the band has simply stripped everything down and produced an album of 10 songs that are each around one minute long. The entire record breezes past in less time than it takes the average krautrock jam to hit its stride. The band members are doubtless prepared for people to wave this album away as a gimmick without actually hearing it, but to do so wouldn't entirely be fair. There's definitely an air of novelty about it, but there's still as much care and attention put into these songs as there is in their other material. Those ""digressions, tangents, and asides"" are all still intact-- they've just been vacuum-packed into an impossibly tiny space.</p>
<p>That level of detail maintained by Ungdomskulen recalls other artists who have worked in a vaguely similar manner, such as the earliest material by Glasgow's <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/The+Yummy+Fur"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Yummy Fur</a> or Manchester post-punkers <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/bIG%2520fLAME?ac=big%20flame"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bIG fLAME</a>. This album also borrows heavily from the same stylistic mien as the latter. Much of it contains elements of the syrupy-funk undertow that bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3226-orange-juice/"">Orange Juice</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/245-a-certain-ratio/"">A Certain Ratio</a> were dabbling in during the 1980s. There's a spikiness to the guitar sound and a playfulness to the lyrics that also recall that era. ""Elle"" contains most of those elements, with its jerky stop-start rhythms and liquid bassline combining to do some pitch-perfect <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1677-gang-of-four/"">Gang of Four</a> cloning. Some of these could be decent off-kilter pop songs if they were allowed to spread their wings a little-- ""It's Official"" and ""Number One"" cover the kind of ground that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1605-franz-ferdinand/"">Franz Ferdinand</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a> were respectively delving into with some success in the past decade.</p>
<p>But therein lies a big part of the problem with <i>Gimme Ten.</i> Too many of these sounds and directions have been thoroughly regurgitated and explored in recent years. Ungdomskulen are certainly well drilled at taking those ideas and condensing them down into bite-sized chunks; it's just a shame they couldn't have chosen some less picked-over territory in which to perform this experiment. There are flashes of inspiration, but the nature of this record makes it a frustrating listen at times. ""Silver or Bronze"" matches synthesized handclaps with some wickedly lumpen rock riffing at one point, and ""Take It Back"" almost bears a chant-along chorus to go with its buzzsaw guitar. Ungdomskulen are more than capable of packing such short songs with plenty of belief, but too often it feels like they're straining under the weight of it all. With so little room to function, the rush to get to where they're going causes any genuine flashes of insight to be discarded with indecent haste.</p>
<p>Despite such reservations, it's to their credit that Ungdomskulen have taken to this task with considerable zeal. There are 10 <a href=""http://www.ungdomskulen.com/gimmeten/video.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">videos</a>, one to go with each song, and the audio files are available for free download from the band's <a href=""http://www.ungdomskulen.com/gimmeten/music.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>. They even prove the worth of the one-minute format a couple of times. ""Walking the Dog"" works just fine as an impossibly brief pop track interrupted by quirky burping noises reminiscent of <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Elastica"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elastica</a>'s ""Line Up""; ""Your Soul"" filters in post-hardcore yelling that's well suited to such claustrophobic expanses. As an exercise put out into the world for free, albeit with a decent amount of love and perspiration, <i>Gimme Ten</i> provides fleeting moments of enjoyment. But instead of really inhabiting its restraints and taking them somewhere revelatory, much of this album serves to highlight why it's not a very good idea to deliberately impose shackles on musical notions that are on the cusp of heading somewhere stimulating. If they're looking for a quickie follow-up project, it might be worth filtering these songs through the same kind of ambition they demonstrated on <i>Cry-Baby</i>, just to see whether all this abstraction can congeal into something more substantial.</p></div>"|15554.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15554-gimme-ten/|5.2|Nick Neyland

Through polluted streams of distorted guitar, you could hear him convulse, spitting wordless sounds as a bubblegum drumbeat took hold. It was evil, it was scary, and it sounded like demons were controlling his organs and limbs. ""Girlfriend"" was a glorious blast of fuzz, here and gone in just over two minutes. It both demonstrated Segall's gift for economy as well as perfected the tone for his work since he left his Epsilons outfit to make music on his own. But <i>Melted</i> as a whole made loud and clear that he was capable of more than just dishing out hard-charging hooks at blazing speeds. He was uncovering an innate understanding for craft as well.</p>
<p>In <i>Goodbye Bread</i>, his first full-length for Drag City, Segall has embraced singer-songwriter craft wholeheartedly. While garage rock O.G.s like the Troggs and the Stooges continue to be an influence, Segall has turned in a relatively calm effort here, choosing to downshift into slower tempos and cleaner sounds, evoking instead the work of John Lennon, Neil Young, and Marc Bolan. Heavyweights. But what makes <i>Goodbye Bread</i> such a success is that we get an even keener sense of what a Ty Segall song sounds like and what that means. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7921-jay-reatard/"" target=""_blank"">Jay Reatard</a>, whose wild-child persona has often been linked to Segall since the former's passing last year, proved that it takes a little more to stand out in this sphere. The same dark energy that set ""Girlfriend"" in motion can be heard here in varying forms, whether in the enormous chorus of ""My Head Explodes"" (a head-bangers delight), the wheelie-popping solo that slices through ""Comfortable Home (A True Story)"", or the sweaty, shivering verses of ""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/Ty%20Segall%20-%20You%20Make%20the%20Sun%20Fry.mp3"" target=""_blank"">You Make The Sun Fry</a>"". Though <i>Goodbye Bread</i> rarely takes a direct route, the thrill becomes much more about the ride from start to finish, than the speed or force of impact.</p>
<p>He achieves this by playing around with notions of pace and structure, as shown by the opening title track. It's a strummy early statement that's altogether very different from what he's shared before. Segall's vocals no longer sound like they're broadcast from the bottom of a well, the guitars are warm and bright, and its melody is vibrant in a very simple, patient manner. ""California Commercial"" is a basher that plods along happily before taking flight on some tightly coordinated guitar lines in the homestretch. And take a look at the run times here and you'll see some welcome variety, too. At first listen, ""I Am With You"" seems a bit aimless over its four minutes, but the way Segall transitions from crescendo to detour to crescendo to left turn to mangy solo proves deliciously inventive upon closer listens.</p>
<p><i>Goodbye Bread</i> is filled with such rich, breathtaking moments, and Segall, who plays every instrument here, sounds as though he's savoring every part of his process. On the slightly creepy ""You Make the Sun Fry"", there's joy in how he rhymes ""love me still"" with ""your Coupe De Ville."" Same goes for the way he locks together the chiming guitar licks that carry ""I Can't Feel It"" home and the thundrous drum fills that punctuate ""My Head Explodes"". It sounds like he's having a blast, excited with every sound and riff he finds, even as he slows down to zoom in on the details.</p></div>"|15557.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15557-goodbye-bread/|8.1|David Bevan

But when it comes to mashups, such wordplay has lost all of its charm. In fact, a punned-out title can now act as an active deterrent for listeners. </span><i><a href=""http://www.futurebombe.com/james-drake.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>James Drake</span></a></i><span>-- a half-hour mix that combines the songs and sounds of, yes, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"" title=""James Blake"">James Blake</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Drake"">Drake</a><span>-- is an exception to the lame-name rule. This is even more impressive since the twentysomething Philadelphia producers/DJs behind it, </span><a href=""http://www.futurebombe.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Bombé""><span class=""misspell"">Bombé</span></a><span> (Tim Shaw) and Mr. Caribbean (Luis Angel Cancel), </span><span>started</span><span> with the title. ""Luis is constantly thinking up pun-based ideas like this,"" wrote Shaw in an e-mail, ""and the </span><span>James Drake</span><span> concept was just too perfect.""</span></p>
<p>The match really is well-suited beyond rhyming monikers, in part because Drake and Blake are both masters at the art of loneliness. Along with his right-hand producer Noah ""40"" Shebib, Drake has perfected the after-party comedown; he's moody, he's drunk, and he desperately needs to talk to someone about about how he's getting vertigo from being at the top. Blake, of course, is a bit more elusive and introverted in his confessionals, but the core sentiment is similarly down and wary. There's not a huge gap between Blake singing, ""I don't know about my dreamin' anymore/ All that I know is I'm fallin' falin' fallin',"" and Drake's, ""What am I afraid of?/ This is supposed to be what dreams are made of."" Both artists' uneasy sense of disillusionment cuts deep.</p>
<p>Not only did Shaw and Cancel pick a wisely like-minded duo, they treat their creation more like a DJ mix than a traditional mashup. This isn't just 30 minutes of Drake verses pasted over Blake's willowy keyboards and stuttering bass. Both music and vocals are cherry-picked from each artist, and the mix is Blake-heavy, with Drake's unmistakable hum buzzing in on only a few tracks. And even when we do hear the rapper, his voice is often slowed down or fucked up; Shaw and Cancel manipulate Drake's vocals the same way James Blake often messes with his own croon, resulting in an even more symbiotic pairing. On ""Fear Logic Freestyle"", Drake is screwed as he repeats, ""Gotta lift the doors/ Blades choppin' through the city streets/ Liquid swords""-- close your eyes tight enough and it's not hard to imagine the same passage showing up on a legit Blake release (give or take a GZA reference). It's hard to tell where Drake ends and Blake begins.</p>
<p><span>The men behind </span><i><span>James Drake</span></i><span> also shy away from simply pimping out their subjects' hits, instead seeking more natural combinations. ""Fall for Your Man at 9 a.m."" gets its pulse from the Blake obscurity ""Give a Man a Rod"", while Drake's early mixtape collaboration with Lil Wayne, ""Ransom"", is used to backbone highlight ""Ransom Money Youth"". Shaw and Cancel also use effects and processing to smear the lines between songs, and they add a touch of original production to the mix, though, according to Shaw, ""We tried to keep it minimal as far as major edits and let the two different voices speak for themselves."" Along the way, we learn just how little difference there is between those voices; <i>James Drake</i>'s title might be facepalm-worthy, but its execution is anything but.</span></p></div>"|15556.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15556-james-drake/|7.6|Ryan Dombal

Headphone music that worked just as well filling rooms, his material had a strong sense of rhythmic pull and intricate density. And while Silkie augmented his developing sound with occasional detours into ""purple"" bass and evergreen boogie funk, what stood out was an overarching style that didn't see a mutual exclusion between cocktail-lounge ambiance and tons of wobbly bass. At times it skewed closer to the pop-gloss sophistication of late-90s UK garage than the escalating bassbin arms race of crossover dubstep.</p>
<p>Follow-up <i>City Limits</i> <i>Volume 2</i> isn't as immediately gratifying or revelatory-- it's a logical progression, reliability replacing novelty. But it also explores the possibility of connecting on a level simultaneously nostalgic and contemporary, right down to the decades-past pirate-radio evocations of its song titles: ""Get Up N Dance"", ""Rock Da Funk"". Repeating themes seem intent on sparking flashbacks, vivid enough to hit specific nerves but vague enough to avoid coming across as specifically derivative-- and threading together a narrative of genre developments in the process.</p>
<p>The synth sax that drove the melody of <i>Volume 1 </i>track ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkSOXaQmxLg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beauty</a>"" is a more prominent component here, punctuating tracks with melodic stabs that could have originated from a decade-old Locked On garage 12""-- if not a late-80s hip-house remix. ""Selva Nova"" tweaks the neo-jungle turf that its title hints at, wringing jittery force out of the old ""Amen"" break and dousing it with a choppy yet liquid 303 bassline. And whenever a voice breaches the surface, it's in a familiar form-- Rastafarian incantations (""Feel""), Roger Troutman talk-box warbles (""New York City""), or a distorted, pitched-up note or two from a rave diva (""Snowed In""). Even the synth and piano melodies that drove some of the more compelling hooks on <i>Volume 1 </i>sound more comfortably worn and identifiable from eras past, like the rollerskate-jam electro of ""Boogie Boy"" or the Junie Morrison-esque g-funk extrapolations in ""Lucky"".</p>
<p>The catch is that once Silkie gets ahold of these vintage signifiers, he pushes them all the way into the red with the pedal-down immediacy of current bass music. Even with the obvious nods to dance music's past, from rave to garage, the forward-looking listener can be assured that Silkie's found a way to make his rhythms even more nuanced and multifaceted. Attempting to break down drum patterns into individual components of snares, hi-hats, and kicks will just wind up causing dizziness; some of the beats are so stuffed with counter-rhythms and jostling emphases-- even before the buildups and breakdowns shift the topography-- that it's almost easy to lose track of just how supple they are. The bass feels a bit more aggressive, too. There are some points, such as late-album tracks ""Taxi Mi Get"" and ""Only For You"", where it takes on the hissing crackle of a shorting-out amp, and others where the wobble shakes things out until rich, individual notes turn into frenetic, staccato trembles. It's bracing stuff when all the elements click-- ""Selva Nova"", the cheery prog-funky of closer ""Outlook"", and Skream collaboration ""Untitled"", which pulls off a great double-paced slow-stride/fast-scramble momentum. And if this album's status as the final <i>City Limits</i> installation marks the end of an early career-defining phase, it suggests a good transition for Silkie: The body of work he's put together so far proves that the man knows his roots, and he knows where to follow them.</p></div>"|15547.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15547-city-limits-volume-2/|7.8|Nate Patrin

Ten minutes in, ""Heat Lightnin'"" and its combination of flickered acoustic guitars, overeager stereo panning effects, and Nic Snyder's campfire-lit whispers conjure a hi-fi version of Animal Collective's embryonic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7940-spirit-theyre-gone-spirit-theyve-vanished/"" target=""_blank""><i>Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished</i></a>. Immediately afterward, there's a Raekwon namedrop over a digital dancehall beat on ""Lonesome Boring Summer"". And that's all before a true-blue C&amp;W waltz wherein the narrator steals a soldier's sweetheart and tries to offer some sort of cold comfort by getting the poor chump to see it from his perspective. What the hell?</p>
<p>Despite the above description, <i>New Heaven </i>isn't a Ween-style mock survey of the past decade's indie rock trends; 1,2,3 are too good-natured and enthusiastic for that sort of thing. Rather than dutifully checking off a to-do list, 1,2,3 select their sounds à la carte, and the strongest songs within the far-flung coordinates of <i>New Heaven</i> simply scan as of-the-moment. They're wise to lead off with ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMyFTF_LVn0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Work</a>"", where Snyder's flamboyant falsetto gives spangly frill to the sort of fists-up, surging arrangements that Arcade Fire and Broken Social Scene made their stock-in-trade. With its flubbed intro and off-kilter guitar leads, ""Confetti"" has a similarly boozy appeal, but the band proves more than capable of craft and finesse on ""Wave Pool"", which acknowledges Brian Wilson's infamous fear of the ocean by applying a Beach Boys melody to a suicidal love letter.</p>
<p>So yeah, it's pure populism down to their lyrical concerns: girls, drinking, or being broke as fuck. Snyder surveys ""the caracass of my mid-twenties"" during ""Lonesome Boring Summer"" and finds little but overlong naps and unpaid bar tabs. For a moment, 1,2,3 escape headlong into fantasia, wondering about Jack Bruce back in the record industry's days of ""golden yachts,"" (""Riding Coach"")-- but rather than put forth a tone-deaf industry lesson, he admits his complicity in stealing his share of music.</p>
<p><i>New Heaven</i>'s biggest liability is how frontloaded it is. Snyder does an admirable job breaking character and adapting his vocals to a droopy barroom drawl on ""Sorry, Soldier"", but his citric tone is occasionally an awkward fit on <i>New Heaven's </i>slow-jamming back half, where the tempo and the melodies slack in lockstep. ""Just Like Heaven (Is Gone)"" and ""20,000 Blades"" are nice enough on their own, but they submit to a certain kind of wallflower indie rock formalism that the first half of the record merely flirts with. For a relatively new band, it's not so bad to be better at fitting in than standing out; in the case of 1,2,3, the songwriting chops are strong enough to give the impression they'll figure out how to be equally adept at both.</p></div>"|15532.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15532-new-heaven/|6.3|Ian Cohen

Despite cementing his reputation in 2008 with <i>Why Can't We Be Like Us</i>, one of the late decade's finest documents of minimal techno, Pronsato has spent the proceeding years taking risks. He made his debut on DFA as half of NDF with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7895-the-top-100-tracks-of-2010/4/"" target=""_blank"">the entrancing </a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7895-the-top-100-tracks-of-2010/4/"" target=""_blank"">""</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7895-the-top-100-tracks-of-2010/4/"" target=""_blank"">Since We Last Met</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7895-the-top-100-tracks-of-2010/4/"" target=""_blank"">""</a>. Most impressive was 2009's <i>The Make Up the Break Up</i>, a 38-minute, Nico-sampling single/EP/album that spun off into salty psychedelia. Not content to develop his ideas over the course of compartmentalized, 10-minute tracks, Pronsato's work has grown larger in scope. This growth culminates in his third LP, <i>Lovers Do</i>, a striking and massive statement that inverts the collaborative nature of much of house music in favor of a more self-contained approach.</p>
<p>Simply put, <i>Lovers Do</i> aligns Pronsato with artists like Terre Thaemlitz and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22117-theo-parrish/"" target=""_blank"">Theo Parrish</a>, artists who abstract house music into large, emotionally charged canvases. Pronsato isn't quite as Art-focused as those two-- from its title on down, the politics of <i>Lovers Do</i> is personal-- but he does juggle house music's tropes to create a vast, rich world. He seems to ignore the genre's most confident ingredients (heavy four-to-the-floor beats, jacked-up sloganeering) and focus on the insular: snatches of jazz, mournful Rhodes keyboards, dubby rhythmic patter. He employs no divas, just a cast of mumbling insomniacs. On the album's second track, over a surprising amount of marimba, you are reminded repeatedly: ""Anybody else/ Anybody but... you."" There are moments-- as during the amorphous, copper-mouthed ""Trio-Out""-- that <i>Lovers Do</i> seems to have more in common with, say, Brooklyn beat-manglers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1411-excepter/"" target=""_blank"">Excepter</a> than Berlin techno.</p>
<p>Impressively, <i>Lovers Do</i> manages to be tonally dark without being foreboding or sinister. ""Noir"" probably applies, but not just the rainy vistas and shadowy alleys that term normally conjures. Think also of waking up in strange rooms, or characters floating in and out of focus. You could certainly stare out at the skyline with <i>Lovers Do</i> as your soundtrack, but its darkness is born out of moments of isolation and doubt we all experience. This happens because Pronsato takes great care not to suffocate listeners. <i>Lovers Do</i> is long-- too long, quite frankly-- but it offers plenty of outs. Its structures are smoky and ill-defined. Pronsato is reticent to let any one element dominate the mix: The vocals weave in and out, the drums flutter to sudden stops, and the electric pianos thumb through just a few notes at a time.</p>
<p><i>Lovers Do</i> picks up steam as it ends. The title track, which closes the album, sounds fittingly optimistic opposite the heavy-lidded opener, ""Lovers Don't"". There is a structure and logic to <i>Lovers Do</i>; it is immersive and artful but Pronsato went to great lengths to ensure that it not be overwhelming. Working again with muse Ninca Leece, <i>Lovers Do</i> acquires a femininity that suggests <i>Lovers Do</i> is a conversation, not an invective. <i>Lovers Do</i> casts this conversation into a diffuse cityscape, one whose darkness feels only temporary.</p></div>"|15550.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15550-lovers-do/|8.1|Andrew Gaerig

There's something irresistible about the thought of a bearded dude from small-town Wisconsin retreating, heartbroken, to a cabin to write some songs-- especially when the result is a record that sounds as hushed and introspective as Bon Iver's 2007 debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10709-for-emma-forever-ago/"" target=""_blank"">For Emma, Forever Ago</a></i>. These days, Vernon is more likely to poke fun at the image, but it endures because it fulfils a fantasy for us as listeners. Even if we don't care for the outdoors, most of us occasionally want to escape our lives, be alone with our thoughts, and see if we can tap into something true. In a time of easy distraction, the idea of heading into a cabin at the edge of the world to create is alluring. By tying the intimacy of that image to Justin Vernon's music, we're able to take the trip with him.</p>
<p>Since that album's release, Vernon's approach to writing and recording has changed. ""I don't find inspiration by just sitting down with a guitar anymore,"" he recently <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/7989-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">told Pitchfork</a>. ""I wanted to build a sound from scratch and then use that sound to make the song."" That difference is clear on <i>Bon Iver</i>. Instead of something that scans as ""folk,"" the music here is more like rustic chamber pop with an experimental edge that makes careful use of arrangement and dynamics. And rather than being tied together by a central theme of loss, Vernon has fully shifted into a more impressionistic mode; these songs are broader and more musically sophisticated than those on <i>For Emma </i>at every turn.</p>
<p>But the thread between this album and its comparatively skeletal predecessor is Vernon's voice, an instrument that feels warm and personal and close regardless of setting. Now that we've heard him <a href=""http://youtu.be/dJVu9QLH83o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">singing hooks with Kanye West</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/#/music-videos/473-gayngs/1651-the-gaudy-side-of-town/"" target=""_blank"">taking the lead with Gayngs</a> on songs that touch on R&amp;B and soft rock, the general sphere of Vernon's voice is clear. He simultaneously evokes the grain and expression of soul music along with the mythological echoes of folk. But more importantly, no one else sounds like him. The Beach Boys have been the primary touchstone for layered vocals in indie music for years, but Vernon's timbre comes from somewhere else entirely. Where ""Beach Boys harmonies"" have a spiritual undercurrent that brings to mind a choirboy's dream of perfection, Vernon sounds like a man who has outgrown such ideas. His voice is earthy and wounded and, despite his astonishing upper register, not something you would describe as ""angelic.""</p>
<p>""Holocene"" contains one of this album's many virtuosic vocal performances. ""Part of me, apart from me,"" Vernon sings early on, and those six words hold a lot. The evocative nature of his diction is apparent even in a simple line like ""I was not magnificent."" He sounds centered and clear while taking stock and allowing memories to be mixed in with the details of the present. His conflicted vocals trigger a half-dozen feelings all at once before releasing the tension with a refrain that finds the fleeting moment where the world seems right: ""I could see for miles, miles, miles.""</p>
<p>Vernon posted <a href=""http://jagjaguwar.com/blog/2011/05/bon-iver-bon-iver-the-lyrics/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Bon Iver</i>'s lyrics</a> shortly after the album leaked last month, but they're not easy to parse-- the storytelling here is oblique. But there are connections. The song titles reference actual places (""Calgary"") and places that sound real, but aren't (""Hinnom, TX"", ""Michicant""); they're less about geography and more about putting a name to a state of mind that mixes clarity and surrealism. And the deeper you sink into these tracks, the harder it becomes to extract specifics. One recurring element is intoxication-- lines about being drunk or high that come with recounted details. Which makes sense, because the album deals with escape and the struggle to get outside yourself. The narrator takes in what's around him, mixing those thoughts with memories of where he's been. Sometimes the lines have a startling specificity (""Third and Lake it burnt away, the hallway/ Was where we learned to celebrate,"" on ""Holocene"") and sometimes they contain words that seem to function more as sound (""fide"" or ""fane"" on ""Perth""). Throughout, there's a strong sense of an observer taking things in and processing confusing images, trying to figure out what can be learned.</p>
<p>If you caught Vernon live after <i>For Emma</i>, you gradually saw him putting more and more emphasis on his band, moving Bon Iver from that solitary project into something that felt more like the work of a group. And <i>Bon Iver</i>, with its rich and layered arrangements, extends that development in a striking direction that's both logical and surprising. Blending natural instrumentation supplied by recruited players-- such as string arranger Rob Moose (Antony and the Johnsons, the National, Arcade Fire) and a horn/woodwind section that includes versatile saxophonist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29454-colin-stetson/"" target=""_blank"">Colin Stetson</a>-- with an array of electronic and treated sounds, the album combines varied textures in ways that are ambitious and unusual but often subtle enough to miss on first glance.</p>
<p>At points, <i>Bon Iver</i> draws on the experiments of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27996-volcano-choir/"" target=""_blank"">Volcano Choir</a>, Vernon's side project with the post-rock outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5703-collections-of-colonies-of-bees/"" target=""_blank"">Collections of Colonies of Bees</a> (members from that group play on the album). Freed from conventional verse/chorus/bridge/chorus structure, the songs become more like tone poems, patient explorations of moods that proceed deliberately but unpredictably. The holistic style is evident on opener ""Perth"", which builds from total silence into a crashing peak over the course of four short minutes. And there's an uncanny moment on the breathtaking ""Michicant"", a song in part about childhood, where a bicycle bell rings twice, pulling you deeper into Vernon's reverie. It's a simple, brief effect, but it's indicative of how the album uses elemental sounds in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Vernon has taken that voice, and these arrangements, and crafted an album that unfolds like a suite. The structure is flawless right up to its conclusion, ""Beth/Rest"", which has been much remarked upon for its unabashed and unironic embrace of 80s adult contemporary pop sounds. If you've spent any time in the vicinity of a radio tuned to light rock, you hear the keyboard tone that opens the song and you think Lionel Richie, Richard Marx, and <a href=""http://youtu.be/ENB2eX-U3a8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""No One Is to Blame""</a>.</p>
<p>It's almost naive of Vernon to think he could pull this off. Yet, heard in context, it stands as one the record's bravest and most deftly executed moments-- not just because it lays bare Vernon's stated admiration for artists like Bonnie Raitt and Bruce Hornsby, but because it's executed to perfection. And while the production attempts to wring something new from a long-maligned sound, the song and voice remain true to Bon Iver as an idea. As a closer, ""Beth/Rest"" is more about finding comfort and resolution after a musical experience that asked more questions than it answered. The song draws a line in the sand for anyone with a deep investment in cool, and Vernon stands behind it with confidence. His belief in himself and in the power of his music is something that encourages us to transcend labels and preconceptions.</p>
<p>After the closeness and austerity of <i>For Emma</i>, Vernon has given us a knotty record that resists easy interpretation but is no less warm or welcoming. You can feel it even as you don't completely understand it-- a testament to its careful construction and Vernon's belief in the power of music to convey deeper meaning. It's a rare thing for an album to have such a strong sense of what it wants to be. <i>Bon Iver</i> is about flow, from one scene and arrangement and song and memory and word into the next-- each distinct but connected-- all leading to ""Beth/Rest"". On the way there, the music moves like a river, every bend both unpredictable and inevitable as it carves sound and emotion out of silence.</p></div>"|15551.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15551-bon-iver/|9.5|Mark Richardson

Both of these things are entirely true. Like Ghost, he's got a pinched, high-pitched, urgent delivery, rendering his boasts in a dense, inventive New York slur that moves from one idea to the next with necksnap immediacy. He's not a rip-off artist; he's got none of Ghost's emotional streak and little of his vividly violent storytelling impulse. But the mere grain of his voice is similar enough to provoke the momentary sensation every time a new verse starts that you're actually hearing Ghostface.</p>
<p>Similarly, the food fixation is no invention. In a recent web interview, Bronson claims he hopes his rap career can bankroll his culinary studies in Tuscany. And even ""Ronnie Coleman"", the song where he laments his weight and lack of impulse control, has enough impassioned food descriptions to make you seriously hungry: ""An hour later, eat the burger with my drug dealer/ Then add the butter to the fudge to make the fudge realer."" Bronson raps about food with the same loving linguistic dizziness that Pusha T raps with about cocaine, or that Lil Wayne raps with about blowjobs.</p>
<p>But even though both the Ghostface and the food talking points hold true, they don't really get to the bottom of what makes <i>Dr. Lecter</i>, Bronson's debut album, such a breath of fresh air. Simply put, <i>Dr. Lecter</i> is a rock-solid, ridiculously fun New York rap album, one that recalls the city's past glories without ever feeling like an act of stylistic exhumation. All the tracks on the LP come from one producer, the heretofore unknown Tommy Mas, whose style would've fit the late-80s classics of Marley Marl and the Juice Crew but maintains a crispness and energy that we rarely hear in retro-rap. Mas chops up breakbeats and soul samples, all the while keeping his sound simple, sparse, and <i>funkier</i> than any recent hip-hop. And Bronson attacks every one of his tracks, delivering quick bursts of streetcorner shit-talk, having too much fun to take himself seriously. Bronson's lyrics can be ignorant as fuck (""Take a dyke on a date/ She let me pipe cuz I'm an ape""), but he doesn't have the nihilistic edge of an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29238-odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all/"" target=""_blank"">Odd Future</a> affiliate. He's just kicking silly bullshit, and it's tough to imagine anyone seriously getting offended.</p>
<p>Maybe the greatest thing about <i>Dr. Lecter</i> is how the album never announces itself as some triumphant return of New York rap. Bronson never claims to be the savior of anything; he just belts out his punchlines and then disappears. Songs typically don't have choruses, and the album's 15 tracks end in less than 45 minutes. Bronson names songs after relatively marginal figures: perennial WWF jobber Barry Horowitz, 90s NBA journeyman Chuck Person, 60s/70s football great Larry Csonka. A few guests show up, but none of them are big names. And though the two rappers' styles are radically different, <i>Dr. Lecter</i> calls up memories of <i>Marcberg</i>, the great and underrated 2010 album from fellow New York shit-talker Roc Marciano. Like that LP, <i>Dr. Lecter</i> doesn't try to break any ground; it just does a long-established style very, very well.</p></div>"|15497.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15497-dr-lecter/|8.1|Tom Breihan

He also seems like an agreeably silly and approachable goofball who just likes to play. (Let us not forget <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42684-watch-mastodons-brent-hinds-in-a-burrito-commercial/"">his recent appearance in a burrito commercial</a>.) That not-taking-yourself-too-seriously side is what comes across here. <i>Fiend Without a Face</i> and <i>West End Motel</i> are two of the guitarist/vocalist's outside projects, one newish and one long-running, packaged here together as a value-priced two-fer. But if you fell in love with Mastodon's early, raw blood-and-thunder, or got on board with their more recent cosmic-scale prog-metal epics, know that you won't be getting much of either here.</p>
<p>Though <i>Fiend Without a Face</i> opens with a spazzy blast of guitar and some unhinged shrieking on ""Calypso"", it sounds more like early Meat Puppets-meet-QOTSA than your average horn-throwing extreme act. The rest of the album ventures into places even more surprising-- sometimes laugh-out-loud funny and sometimes heart-on-sleeve sad-- given Hinds' rep as a glowering shredder. Anyone with a full-time band, especially one as musically demanding as Mastodon, who still has the energy to spearhead two other groups has to be a little musically restless and prone to compulsive songwriting. Hinds indulges here, stretching wildly across parched desert-rock boogie, down-and-out country, even (whisper it) sprightly indie-ish guitar pop. There's a playfulness to both bands' material, especially the occasional deranged vocalizing and overall jamming vibe, but things never (or mostly never) stray into sloppiness.</p>
<p>If anything, what unites the music here, at least the <i>Fiend Without a Face</i> material, is Hinds' manic virtuoso guitar playing. But instead of Priest theatrics or Sabbath crunch, we get a guitar that veers between rockabilly at warp-speed, surf music stripped of kitsch, 1960s chase-scene scores, and amphetamine-grade country jangle. ""Tsunami"" even reminds me of the bright, jittery sound of the early Feelies. It's not all grins and crazy rhythms, though. The latter-half, especially the off-brand Tom Waits barroom lament ""Under My Skin"", hews closer to country's crying-on-the-floor side, and ""She's on Fire"" is just plain pretty alt-rock. This record is in no way a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12872-crack-the-skye/"" target=""_blank""><i>Crack the Skye</i></a>-style statement; its off-the-cuff amiability will probably be  off-putting to as many Mastodon heads as it is charming. It sounds like a lark, especially if you're expecting metal's cathartic roar, but even so, it's an undeniably fun lark.</p></div>"|15521.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15521-fiend-without-a-facewest-end-motel/|6.8|Jess Harvell

Dramatizing a post-Rapture socialist society and featuring a song written by Christian rock wunderkind Larry Norman (unfortunately performed by the awful Fishmarket Combo), the movie is an intriguing artifact from a time when believers didn't flee from popular culture but embraced it as a vehicle for a spiritual mission. It's a sharp contrast to the 80s, when the Satanic Panic scared many Christians away from rock music, and to the 90s, when the Christian rock industry marketed itself as a message-first alternative to secular music.</p>
<p>Bodies of Water, an L.A. outfit whose unison and harmony vocals suggest the enthusiasm of a spirited youth choir, harken back to that open-minded 70s heyday, although thankfully not to the scare tactics of <i>A Thief in the Night</i>. Core couple David and Meredith Metcalf pepper their songs with Biblical imagery, yet remain too enamored with pop music in all its many forms to confine themselves to any one particular genre or approach. That excitement and a sense of boundless possibilities fueled their 2007 debut, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10464-ears-will-pop-eyes-will-blink/"">Ears Will Pop &amp; Eyes Will Blink</a></i>.</p>
<p>Following <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12021-a-certain-feeling/"">a lackluster sophomore album</a> on Secretly Canadian, the Metcalfs channeled a lot of their energy into ABBA-tastic side project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13457-expressions/"" target=""_blank"">Music Go Music</a>. Founding members Kyle Gladden and Jessie Conklin left the group, eventually to be replaced with a revolving roster of friends, acquaintances, and onlookers. Finally, the Metcalfs built a home studio and recorded their third album, <i>Twist Again</i>, which they're releasing on their own Thousand Tongues label. They're also having their first child.<span> </span><i>Twist Again</i>, then, signals a period of rededication, rebirth, and just plain birth, but its songs sound surprisingly somber and subdued.</p>
<p>In this more restrained setting, Bodies of Water aren't quite as commanding or charming, but they compensate with more confident, nuanced songs that incorporate elements of showtunes, disco, and folk, plus mariachi fanfares and hallelujah choruses. ""Ever With Us"" juxtaposes barebones doo-wop piano with countrypolitan strings, and the stylistic friction mirrors the domestic drama of the lyrics. Standout ""Rise Up, Careful"" fits in a lengthy saxophone solo, and the curious pairing with Meredith Metcalf's mournful vocals makes for one of the best and most unexpected moments on the album. On the other hand, ""New Age Nightmare"" nearly works itself into a frenzied din but backs away. Rather than let the music go wild, Bodies of Water play it safe.</p>
<p>Both Metcalfs remain sharply charismatic performers, but the downcast quality to Meredith's vocals, especially on ""Lights Out Forever"", is new. The woman who once yelped ecstatically to the back pews now exudes a spiritual melancholy similar to that of her husband's grainy voice. There's a newly ponderous tone to their music, too, which may stem from the lyrics: <i>Twist Again</i> is preoccupied with the conflict between heavenly love and earthly love. Traditionally, love of God ought to supersede romantic and musical love, yet that order is in constant flux from one song to the next<i>, </i>as Bodies of Water indulge some new musical idea or wrap their voices seductively around each other. Even if <i>Twist Again</i> occasionally comes across as less than rapturous, the Metcalfs' conflicts animate these songs, as though they've realized that marriage, music, and God are not only inseparable, but quite possibly all the same thing.</p></div>"|15529.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15529-twist-again/|7.4|Stephen M.

But even a cursory listen to Shine 2009's <i>Realism</i> shows how deeply the band is committed to the allure of dated sounds.</p>
<p>The Balearic-leaning drum breaks and keys of opener ""Graduation"" nod toward the early 1990s, and indeed that decade's pop music legacy looms large over most of the record. Wistful shades of Air France also emerge on that track, which has a pleasant collage feel with beachy ambient sounds lending a bit of texture and character. Singer Sami Suova's straight-laced vocals sound like a cross between a more lackadaisical Bernard Sumner and the slightly angelic tinge of 1990s European boybands-- ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbsAqs3YHyg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pray</a>"" by Take That comes to mind here.</p>
<p>The kitsch dynamic is even more heavily pronounced on ""<a href=""http://soundcloud.com/shine2009/sofree"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">So Free</a>"", as a frozen-in-time Paula Abdul contributes backing vocals on top of Suova's blissed-out chorus. She ramps up the camp factor, almost ad-libbing on top of cheap-sounding electronic piano stabs and synth strings. As a pastiche it has a certain charm, and while it's easy to be carried away by the light-hearted fun at its core, there's a nagging feeling that Shine 2009 don't move much beyond playing dress up.</p>
<p>The moments where the group looks to update the conversation, as on ""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/Shine%202009%20-%20New%20Rules.mp3"" target=""_blank"">New Rules</a>"", sound far more persuasive. That track in particular bounces with a hypnotically looping synth pattern and clubby drums, and it feels a little less studied. The shades of darkness in the textures and vocals in particular make for an interestingly sunburnt take on the Balearic sound. The directive of ""I'll tell you how to do it/ Get ready for the new rules"" also comes across as unexpectedly creepy in this context and makes for an oddly gripping narrative.</p>
<p>The title track is another intriguing moment, layering a delicate, monastic chorale on top of sliced keys and what sounds like a synthesized didgeridoo. As on ""New Rules"", there are enough leftfield elements and sounds to make for an interesting and evocative collage of material. But ultimately these moments of subversion are outnumbered by Shine 2009's more hollow imitations-- the worst being ""One"", a song played way too straight, its wah-wah laced guitar and glockenspiel synth sounding like the type of tacky chillout music played in an upscale cocktail bar. Suova's unassuming voice becomes part of the malaise instead of the laid-back counterpoint it plays on the record's stronger moments.</p>
<p>At their best Shine 2009's backward-leaning pop songs make for a lighthearted, fun listen. But the problem with the remodelled nostalgia of <i>Realism</i> is that it's hard to recommend it over the real thing, beyond the sensation of kitsch novelty that the record invokes. Dig any deeper and the pastiche feels a little empty; it can't hope for the kind of memories conjured up when you are caught off guard by a song you used to know and love.</p></div>"|15548.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15548-realism/|6.1|Hari Ashurst

Over a muted beat and a quiet circular guitar line, Nadler again pines for a lover who's left, something she's done about as well as any young American songwriter during the last decade. ""Cobalt and sea, come back to me,"" she sings, her loneliness delivered like a ghost's whisper. ""I'll never do you wrong."" But 90 seconds in, ""Puppet Master"" takes an unexpected turn, adding vibraphone and transitioning to a near-waltz that suggests the Ronnettes, just slowed and simplified. Nadler's experience sublimates into a puppet's innocence: ""Lately, all I want is you,"" she offers, sweetly and almost cheerily. ""Puppet master, see me through.""</p>
<p>Nadler volleys between mourning and flirting on ""Puppet Master"", the centerpiece of her first album for own label, <a href=""http://boxofcedarrecords.tumblr.com/wholesale"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Box of Cedar</a>. It's a telling move, too: Her looks at love have grown increasingly intricate, subtle and-- most importantly-- realistic since her 2004 debut. Her songs are now much too considered to be only elegiac, too complex to be simply sad. That idea translates musically as well. Just like ""Puppet Master"", the best songs here make slight and unexpected detours. With the help of producer Brian McTear, the songs fit together naturally; whether above synthesizers or acoustic guitar, Nadler never sounds forced. ""In Your Lair, Bear"", for instance, is an opening masterstroke, a bold six-minute move that patiently rises over its duration. Drums, strings, electric guitars, and harmonies enter and exit in turn; Nadler's two characters use each other, seasonally wearing one another like amulets or accessories. ""I took you home, and I crashed you,"" she sings at the end, subverting her general role as the one demolished by love. She assumes the power just to admit she's abused it.</p>
<p>Nadler's songs are frank, careful examinations of all the ways a relationship can grow cold. Her music sounds as somber as ever here, and her distant air remains one of the most absolutely haunting things you're likely to find anywhere near indie rock. But she's grown past solipsism to become more of a reporter on the battles she's seen. During ""Alabaster Queen"", she admits giving over to a someone who is nothing but trouble, excusing the ""women wistful wanting"" with a deliberateness that foretells how badly this will all end. For the emotional minefield ""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/Marissa%20Nadler%20-%20Baby%20I%20Will%20Leave%20You%20in%20the%20Morning.mp3"" target=""_blank"">Baby I Will Leave You in the Morning</a>"", Nadler's protagonist preemptively asks for forgiveness before she hits the road, where she'll drink to sleep-- most likely, with another lover. She doesn't blame the despair of the gorgeously pained ""Wind Up Doll"" on the dead husband, and she doesn't badmouth the lover who doesn't reciprocate her eternal, exhausting feelings during ""Wedding"". She just shares those stories in songs that are as gorgeous as they are elliptical and intriguing.</p>
<p>Nadler's diligently expanded her reach as a writer and arranger during the past decade, culminating so far in the expansive sounds of 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12813-little-hells/"" target=""_blank""><i>Little Hells</i></a> and the subtly twisting forms of this new eponymous album.

He defended Ronald Reagan in interviews, skewered Pepsi and Budweiser in a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSSvzCNBvlQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> banned by MTV, and fought off lawsuits from his label, Geffen, over a string of stylistically divergent albums. One of these was <i>Old Ways</i>, a traditional-country throwback that wasn't too many cornfields removed from Young's star-making 1972 release, <i>Harvest</i>. After some twists and turns that included 1982's synth-pop transgression <i>Trans</i> and 1983's goofy 50s rock homage <i>Everybody's Rockin</i>', a radically revamped <i>Old Ways</i> eventually came out in 1985, between a couple of tours backed by a crack live band of country-music veterans called the International Harvesters. This short-lived group included longtime Young collaborators Ben Keith, Spooner Oldham, and Tim Drummond.</p>
<p>The International Harvesters may not hold the same exalted status in the Neil Young story as Crazy Horse or the Stray Gators, but they get their proper due on the latest installment of Young's <i>Archives Performance Series</i>, which continues to defy all laws of chronology and numerical order. (<i>A Treasure</i>, the sixth set released in the series, is classified as Volume 9; it follows 2009's <i>Dreamin' Man Live '92</i>, aka Volume 12.) So far, the <i>Archives Performance Series</i> has mostly featured embryonic performances of what would become Young's best-known work; <i>A Treasure</i> is the first entry to put the spotlight on a less celebrated stretch of his career. As such, this choppy compilation of Harvesters tour highlights allows us to reassess some of Young's 80s output outside its contentious context.</p>
<p>Among all of Young's 80s genre exercises, the Harvesters country detour was the most musically in tune with his canonical turn-of-the-70s work. But Young shot that music through with a persona every bit as calculated as the skinny-tied humanoid heard on <i>Trans, </i>or the ersatz Elvis seen on the cover of <i>Everybody's Rockin'</i>. For the Harvesters tour, Young wasn't so much playing country music as playing the role of a country-music singer: taking the stage in a Harley-Davidson ballcap, spouting over-the-top pro-America rhetoric in the press, and booking the band to play state fairs, rodeos, and variety TV shows instead of the usual big-market concert halls.</p>
<p>Only Young knows how genuine his new image really was, but the recordings on <i>A Treasury</i> capture a very real desire to leave behind Geffen-- and the increasingly corporatized rock world-- by taking refuge in the heartland. Helped by the frenzied fiddling of Rufus Thibodeaux, the Harvesters transform <i>Harvest</i> warhorse ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g75N4Tfln2o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Are You Ready for the Country</a>"" from FM-radio road-trip anthem into an advertising jingle for their own Nashville-bound sound. (Yes, <i>Old Ways</i>' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZEl_1ZJeB4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Get Back to the Country</a>"" is included here, too.) And if Young's label and old fans were frustrated by his Music City makeover, the middle American audience ate it up. Auto-industry address ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2q-k4X_H9o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Motor City</a>"", from 1981's <i>Re-ac-tor</i>, may have originally been written in cranky character, but on <i>A Treasure</i>, an enthusiastic crowd receives its made-in-the-U.S.A. boosterism as gospel.</p>
<p>However, unlike previous <i>Archives Performance Series</i> issues, <i>A Treasure</i>'s set list pulls from a diverse, career-spanning range of sources. The collection stands less as a specific document of an elaborate ""fuck you"" directed at Geffen and more as a testament to Young's undiminished reputation as a fiery, inventive live performer-- even when he was releasing the weakest albums of his career. The standouts here are a pair of reworked obscurities: a gorgeous rendition of the Buffalo Springfield chestnut ""Flying on the Ground Is Wrong"" (written by Young but originally sung by Richie Furay) and a show-stopping charge through ""Southern Pacific"" that upgrades the <i>Re-ac-tor</i> version's sluggish boogie into a banjo-powered barn-burner.</p>
<p><i>A Treasure</i> also boasts five previously unreleased tracks. Some of them could have easily been left in the bootleg bin, such as the cheeky tear-in-my-beer ballad ""Let Your Fingers Do the Walking"" and swinger ""Soul of a Woman"", which predicts later Young band Bluenotes. But others handily transcend the datedness of so much 80s Neil. The sweet serenades ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw-24evBDOM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amber Jean</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfBHbbyD6A8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nothing Is Perfect</a>"", for instance, could sit comfortably among the timeless, low-key classics on 1978's <i>Comes a Time</i>, while the closing rager ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRhRkKMoMC8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grey Riders</a>"" anticipates 1989 return-to-form <i>Freedom</i>. All of which suggest that Young's greatest affront to Geffen in the 80s wasn't making subpar, ""unrepresentative"" albums. It was not giving the label the satisfaction of releasing his better efforts from the era.</p></div>"|15535.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15535-archives-performance-series-vol-9-a-treasure/|7.3|Stuart Berman

With his soft voice awash in electronic hums and next to a tranquil piano line, you can almost believe him. But the claim seems mostly aspirational. His unassuming vocals quiver and crack with emotion, giving the impression not of a person who can't feel, but of one who must be cautious of feeling too much. That's a common symptom of being a teenager, which Lacey is. So it's extra-impressive that <i>Plantation </i>never goes over the top. Instead, this highly personalized fusion of dark indie-pop and laptop ambient taps into volatile wellsprings of longing, resentment, and fear with controlled intensity.</p>
<p><i>Plantation </i>is very much a bedroom production. <span>Often using either a cloud of tone or a simple piano figure as a base, Lacey fashions understated, compact hooks from guitar, vocal loops, and software synthesizers, and then rolls them out for just long enough to lodge them in memory before they vanish.</span> As mentioned in a <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12207-whend-you-find-me/"">Playlist review</a> of ""When'd You Find Me?"", <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/470-bright-eyes/"">Bright Eyes</a> might wind up with something like <i>Plantation </i>if he judiciously added vocals to a Kompakt <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/search/?query=pop+ambient&amp;search_type=standard"">Pop Ambient</a></i> sampler. But Lacey's vision is unique, and makes the album cohesive despite its piecemeal diversity.</p>
<p>Many different touchstones flow into one retiring mood. Opening instrumental ""In Old Theaters"" has the stately drive of <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"">M83</a>. The standout ""Tiny Little Boy"" nods to R&amp;B with splashy mechanical drums and a soulfully lilting vocal performance. A techno influence becomes more pronounced in the back half: On ""Blinds with You"", a droning synth line soars and slumps with weary majesty over crisply staggered drums, and ""Veins"" owes an unabashed debt to <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"">the Field</a>'s slithering pulses. The blurry melodies of chillwave, the drafty space of dubstep, and the hypnotic repetitions of classical minimalism are all contextual influences. But everything blends into a unified voice thanks to Lacey's knack for thoughtful connective tissue and striking lyrical point of view.</p>
<p>This is thoroughly a break-up record, but Lacey deals in implication and austerity. <span>His perspective has a mature balance: He makes accusations that cut both ways, and then he questions them. We get not just the wounded heart </span>and its grudges but the filter of the skeptical mind, watching from a critical distance. <i>Plantation'</i>s recording quality is a little uneven, but that seems a small price to pay for the genuine intimacy that can occur when a young person holes up in a bedroom with a computer, a guitar, and his complex sorrow, figuring out on his own what can be made of it all.</p></div>"|15534.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15534-plantation/|7.7|Brian Howe

The Vermont duo's constant production has simply become one of its defining facts. In addition to a steady stream of studio albums for Ecstatic Peace!, <a href=""http://www.ecstaticpeace.com/mvee"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MV &amp; EE</a> have continued to release small-batch recordings on their own Child of Microtones label, including a <i>Dick's Picks</i>-style series of live recordings on the offshoot Heroine Celestial Agriculture subsidiary.</p>
<p>Over the course of this massive discography, MV &amp; EE's music has ranged through overlapping regions of pastoral psych-folk, cosmic country and blues, and expansive, Crazy Horse-inspired guitar jams that occasionally cozy up against what was once known as grunge. As with many such prolific acts, the duo's work can strike a balance between the deeply rewarding and the exasperating, as each listener is bound to choose a favorite from among the different aspects of their sound. When fatigue sets in, there seems to be little harm in sitting out a few albums and waiting for them to cycle back around again.</p>
<p>MV &amp; EE have now rewarded such patience with two fine new studio albums, <i>Country Stash</i> and <i>What I Became</i>, the latter of which is nominally a Matt Valentine solo album. On each album, the musicians have drawn in the fences just enough to sharpen their focus on a specific portion of their overall sound. Longtime fans will find much to savor on both albums, or, failing that, will almost certainly fall heavily for one or the other.</p>
<p>It might sound strange to call an album that features multiple nine-plus-minute jams ""restrained,"" but that nevertheless is how <i>Country Stash</i> can feel. Despite the extended guitar solos, the album is one of MV &amp; EE's most tuneful and song-oriented collections to date, and their most immediately likable since 2006's <i>Green Blues</i>. Not too surprisingly, the duo has found a kindred spirit in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27672-woods/"" target=""_blank"">Woods</a>' Jeremy Earl, who contributes harmony vocals on ""Foxy One"" and ""<a href=""http://alteredzones.com/dl/audio/1266/mvee-the-crash-palace-of-records.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crash Palace of Records</a>"". And though MV &amp; EE have never been prone to creating the type of melodic hooks that actually prove hummable, both of these tracks have the amiable spirit and loose-limbed energy that are familiar features on Woods records.</p>
<p>MV &amp; EE's albums have frequently benefitted from guest appearances, including such notables as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"" target=""_blank"">J Mascis</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3980-sunburned-hand-of-the-man/"" target=""_blank"">Sunburned Hand of the Man</a>'s John Moloney. Country Stash features perhaps their most unlikely collaborator yet in Andy Ramsay, best known for his work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"" target=""_blank"">Stereolab</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1942-the-high-llamas/"" target=""_blank"">the High Llamas</a>. Ramsay's high-precision style seems a counterintuitive match for MV &amp; EE's improvisational wandering. But the pairing works surprisingly well, with Ramsay providing atmospheric electronics, percussion, and production for ""Tea Devil"" and ""No There, There"". ""Tea Devil"", which has appeared on at least one previous MV &amp; EE release in a different form, is here rendered with a brooding, ominous pulse, as Elder delivers a smoldering vocal performance to craft an instant highlight in the group's catalog.</p>
<p>Matt Valentine takes a largely different approach on <i>What I Became</i>. The album's solo billing is a little misleading: Elder contributes vocals to one track and Jeremy Earl adds percussion in several places, while throughout MV applies a delicate lacing of acoustic and electric guitar overdubs. In other words, this release doesn't seem that different from a proper MV &amp; EE album, and it achieves a sound that is more introspective than solitary.</p>
<p>It is, however, one of Valentine's more folk-oriented albums in a good while, and it should be a welcome sight for those who've been missing that side of his playing. On refreshing opener ""Continuing the Good Life"", Valentine offers a reminder of what an expert acoustic picker he can be. On such tracks as ""PK Dick"" or ""Ave. B"", the electric and acoustic instruments seem to descend upon the same spot from opposite directions, illuminating the songs in hazy silhouette. Valentine's effects-heavy vocals tend to shy from the spotlight without Elder there for assistance; his voice often seems there as much to provide an atmospheric backdrop as to deliver his whispery lyrics.</p>
<p>Both albums have been issued in nice-looking vinyl editions, which is fitting. For as many cassettes and CD-Rs as MV &amp; EE have released, the immersive qualities of vinyl make it a natural format for the duo. Pressed in limited runs, these albums might prove a little more difficult to track down, but by now MV &amp; EE fans should be used to exercising patience.</p></div>"|15533.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15533-country-stash-what-i-became/|7.4|Matthew Murphy

The Iowa City duo's members-- percussionist Ryan Garbes and keyboardist/vocalist Shawn Reed-- used to play in Raccoo-oo-oon, a sorely missed noise-rock group that released three records and a handful of rambling, live-to-tape jam sessions before disbanding in 2008. Since then, Reed in particular has established a heavy underground presence, both through his Night People label (Peaking Lights, Dirty Beaches, Pocahaunted) and his hieroglyphic-style visual art.</p>
<p>Where Raccoo-oo-oon went heavy on spastic syncopation and post-punk guitar skree, Wet Hair have followed a mellower path. By patching rinky-dink synths through a bevy of effects, they work up vintage krautrock haze on a DIY budget. The band's two albums have been heavy with luxuriant lo-fi drones and unhurried eight-minute bliss-outs. This time around, they've opted to rein in the jams a little. Wet Hair's third LP, <i>In Vogue Spirit</i>, is its most straightforward batch of songs yet. Garbes and Reed temper their open-ended improv with the traditional stuff of rock: guitar riffs, deep bottom end, and propulsive rhythms.</p>
<p>Album opener ""Echo Lady"" flows forward at full speed, powered by fuzz-bass and motorik percussion beneath a wall of dizzying keyboard textures. It's <i>In Vogue Spirit</i>'s immediate, head-bobbing moment. After that, things only get weirder. On ""Tarantula"", a web of interlocking melodies spins over the distant rattle of a junk-shop drum machine. Reed delivers his lyrics in a cool-headed, Alan Vega-worthy whisper, which is then further obscured by a cloud of echo.</p>
<p>In their previous output, Garbes and Reed took heavy inspiration from the German electronic psychedelic music of the 1960s and 70s, but added a layer of ear-scorching grit inherited from the mid-00s noise scene. On <i>In Vogue Spirit</i>, their reference points have drifted toward the dreamy pop moves of Silver Apples and Spacemen 3, as well as contemporary psych-droners like Moon Duo and Sun Araw. The headier compositions, ""Liquid Jesus"" and ""Cosmic Radio"", forgo distortion in favor of lush and dreamy texture.</p>
<p>In both Raccoo-oo-oon and Wet Hair, Garbes and Reed have been uncompromising in their pursuit of the outer limits. They set up a table full of banged-up doodads, set the controls for the heart of the sun, and let it rip. That hasn't changed. But with <i>In Vogue Spirit</i>, Garbes and Reed have delivered a more consistent, considered record. Space is still the place, but they've found shortcuts to getting there.</p></div>"|15528.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15528-in-vogue-spirit/|7.2|Aaron Leitko

This was no random act: In 1998, a new Mercury Rev album could have felt like a postcard from a long-lost, old friend. Unlikely beneficiaries of the post-Nirvana major-label cattle call, Mercury Rev initially overcame the inter-band acrimony that fueled their first two brilliantly frazzled albums (1991's <i>Yerself Is Steam</i> and 1993's <i>Boces</i>), only to slip further into oblivion with the more refined but commercially ignored 1995 release, <i>See You on the Other Side</i>. A subsequent improvised recording released under the name Harmony Rockets (1995's <i>Paralyzed Mind of the Archangel Void</i>) suggested the band was forsaking populist ambition to delve deeper into the psych-noise underground. Aside from a songwriting credit for Rev ringleader Jonathan Donahue on the Chemical Brothers'<i> Dig Your Own Hole</i>, by 1997, Mercury Rev had effectively vanished.</p>
<p>The arrival of <i>Deserter's Songs </i>on the nascent V2 label was a brow-raiser in and of itself; but that sense of pleasant surprise turned to dumbstruck disbelief once the CD was dropped in the player. Mercury Rev had flirted with symphonic flourishes and sentimental balladry before, but usually delivered them in a haze of distortion (<i>Boces</i>' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h2VvMgwIF4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Something For Joey</a>"") or cheeky, irreverent arrangements (<i>See You on the Other Side</i>'s ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hspi4Lblp18"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Everlasting Arm</a>""). <i>Deserter's Songs</i>' opening track, ""Holes"", however, was something else entirely: Never before had Donahue left his helium-high croon so vulnerable and exposed, and never before had the band's densely textured arrangements been deployed to such moving emotional effect, with the song's eye-welling surge of orchestration and weepy bowed-saw lines perfectly complementing Donahue's crestfallen lyrics.</p>
<p>And while there were always themes of New York state iconography running through the band's disjointed discography-- the Coney Island Cyclone, the Rockettes, Bronx cheers-- <i>Deserter's Songs</i> projected an especially vivid sense of place, casting a set of intimate, romantic narratives against the staggering natural beauty of the band's upstate New York surroundings. Credit producer/bassist Dave Fridmann for foregrounding certain agrarian classic-rock influences-- namely, Jack Nitzsche-era Neil Young, the Band, and Brian Wilson-- that were heretofore buried behind the band's wall of squall; Mercury Rev even went so far as to solicit guest contributions from Levon Helm and Garth Hudson for some authentic <i>Big Pink</i> flavor.</p>
<p>In a sense, <i>Deserter's Songs </i>practically functions as a tourist brochure for the Empire State, with the stirring centerpiece track ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fusKcZjj7dg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Opus 40</a>"" referencing both the titular stone-sculpture garden in Saugerties and the looming Catskill mountains, while ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gua6CYaScp8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hudson Line</a>"" pays tribute to the train route that provides an upstate escape from New York City. I had always written off the latter track as <i>Deserter's Songs</i>' most frivolous-- owing to Hudson's supper-club-smooth sax line and the meek vocal courtesy of guitarist Grasshopper-- but in it, we hear the album's guiding philosophy: ""Gonna leave the city, gonna catch the Hudson Line/ You know I love the city, but I haven't got the time.""</p>
<p><i>Deserter's Songs</i> was likewise a necessary act of retreat for a band that had long been defined by chaos and turmoil, and its peaceful, back-to-nature ethos felt all the more radical at a time when the harsh, mechanized sounds of big-beat electronica and nu-metal dominated the airwaves. The album's considerable critical success practically spawned a sub-genre of its own, with subsequent releases by the Flaming Lips (<i>The Soft Bulletin</i>, also recorded by Fridmann at his Tarbox Studios), the Delgados (<i>The Great Eastern</i>; Fridmann again), and Grandaddy (<i>The Sophtware Slump</i>) all hewing to a similar balance of lyrical intimacy and orchestral expanse. And while Mercury Rev's spotty track record since <i>Deserter's Songs</i> has currently driven the band into the same sort of limbo in which they found themselves prior to recording the album, you can still hear a distinctly <i>Deserter's</i> mix of the rustic and the epic in contemporaries like Fleet Foxes, My Morning Jacket, and Arcade Fire.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this 2xCD reissue will serve to raise the band's stock once again, and that could very well be the true impetus behind this package; tellingly, Mercury Rev have chosen to mark their 20th anniversary not by re-releasing their 1991 debut, but rather the record that has effectively allowed them to survive for two decades. Collectors of <i>Deserter's Songs</i>' singles will know that, for B-sides, the band often resorted to its deep arsenal of covers, but none of these is represented on this issue's bonus disc (presumably because many of them were already compiled on the 2006 best-of collection, <i>Stillness Breathes</i>). But we do get a batch of rough yet illuminating demos that help connect the dots between Mercury Rev's experimental roots and <i>Deserter's Songs</i>' immaculate conception. The Tascam takes on ""Endlessly"" and ""Tonite It Shows"" sound closer to early-70s Lennon than their more Disneyfied final versions, and the sax-less ""Hudson Line"" feels much less anomalous in this setting.</p>
<p>Most remarkable of all is an embryonic version of ""Goddess on a Hiway"", both for its crude, tape-decayed presentation and its original recording date: 1989. That Donahue was sitting on <i>Deserter's Songs</i>' lead single for almost 10 years could be seen as proof of the early Mercury Rev's preference for the anarchic over the affecting. Or maybe he just needed to wait for his band's darkest, most uncertain hour to sing that chorus-- ""<i>I know... it ain't gonna last</i>""-- with the conviction and desperation it demands.</p></div>"|15393.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15393-deserters-songs-deluxe-edition/|9.3|Stuart Berman

Her process, which involves layering her voice with a <a href=""http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=Loop+Station&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=shop&amp;cid=12097601460878287644&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jnb2TcvNJaWq0AGEk43tDA&amp;ved=0CFoQ8wIwAw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Loop Station</a>, is defined by solitude; a feeling that comes across in her music with full force. So it was a nice surprise to hear that she would contribute to the Rvng label's <a href=""http://www.igetrvng.com/frkwys/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FRKWYS</a> series of 12"" records, which pairs contemporary and classic electronic artists. Barwick drew <a href=""http://www.ikuemori.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ikue Mori</a> of the seminal no-wave band <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DNA</a>, who has ably kept up with new technology, evolving from trap sets to drum machines to computer software. The four extended, improvised movements that compose <i>FRKWYS Vol. 6</i> are familiar turf for Mori, but a whole new world for Barwick.</p>
<p>The music was recorded in New York's White Columns gallery last fall-- half with the musicians each isolated in a cubicle; Mori with her laptop and Barwick with her looping console. (A video documenting the performance can be found <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42546-julianna-barwick-ikue-mori-team-for-improv-lp/"">here</a>.) Right away, with ""Dream Sequence"", fans of <i>Florine </i>and <i>The Magic Place</i> will find themselves in new territory. Barwick's voice is lightly scattered amid an array of computerized slide whistles and metallic resonance-- not an enveloping presence, but a thing among things. Several minutes elapse before she unleashes one of her trademarked melodious shrieks. Playing against Barwick's usual placidity, it's almost chaotic, but still has a clear build, climax, and resolution.</p>
<p>Mori's music comes from machines but evokes the natural world, pulling in sounds like dripping water, crackling electricity, and warped chimes. This is consistent across all four tracks, though each has a singular arc and feel once you get past the uniformly distressed surfaces. On ""Stalactite Castle"", Barwick's voice competes with mechanical vortices that call to mind Ellen Allien and Antye Greie. Then she takes a more leading and openly songful role on ""Rain and Shine at the Lotus Pond"" and ""Rejoinder"", with an almost choral home stretch bringing the record to an arresting close.</p>
<p>Barwick fans may feel an initial wave of disappointment that this doesn't bash you over the head with holiness the way her records do. And those who appreciate her music through the filter of <a href=""http://www.enya.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Enya</a>, rather than <a href=""http://music.hyperreal.org/artists/brian_eno/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a>, may find Mori's haywire electronics simply indigestible. It's not the sort of thing you just throw on in the background, as <i>The Magic Place</i> could be. But taken on its own terms, it's a sneakily bewitching record that bodes well for Barwick's future. Until now, we knew that she was very good at one thing-- <i>FRKWYS Vol. 6 </i>is an encouraging sign that she's willing and able to branch out.</p></div>"|15538.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15538-frkwys-vol-6/|7.3|Brian Howe

The group set aside the unfinished <i>Stars</i> sessions in the wake of Sayre's passing, putting together last year's limited-edition <i>Words Are Stupid</i> before returning to the project. Which makes sense, as hearing Sayre's mournful bow work while still grieving for the man himself might've been too much, too soon. Sayre's rippling violin, echoing and amplifying frontman Jerry DeCicca's pitch-black lyrics, was key to the sound of the Black Swans, and <i>Don't Blame the Stars</i> proves a fine showcase for their late bandmate. But it's also a testament to the Swans' adaptability, both as a band of survivors and an ever-changing musical unit.</p>
<p>With its spacious pick-up arrangements and occasional shaggy-dog spoken word interludes (a tribute of sorts to Willie Nelson's <i>Yesterday's Wine</i>), <i>Don't Blame the Stars</i> is perhaps the closest the Swans have come to a straight-up country record. The gothic smear that sat underneath 2007's <i>Change!</i> is largely gone, and while the stripped-back remnants aren't exactly Bakersfield smooth, much of it lands somewhere between, say, <i>Nashville Skyline</i> and early-70s outlaw. The playing is stellar, if sparse, with apt but unobtrusive accoutrement; they leave that to Sayre, whose violin winds and weaves through much of the empty space left by DeCicca's halting delivery. It's a gorgeous sounding record, its live-in-a-room feel and tastefully-employed vintage flourishes-- the reverb-heavy guitar under its title track, the chug of the barely-there background vocals in ""I Forgot to Change the Windshield Wipers in My Mind""-- lending it the same gentle charms of a beat-up gem from the C&amp;W bin.</p>
<p>As ever, it's the weary bemusement of DeCicca's lyrics that really sets <i>Don't Blame the Stars</i> apart. He begins the ""woe is me"" crisis of ""Boo Hoo"" with a bit about getting buggered by a clown; later he loses a lover in plain sight, eats cold soup, and rationalizes his way through another drink. DeCicca seems to be toying with country conventions here-- especially the earnest-seeming spoken word stuff-- but there's a deep tradition-steeped reverence to it as well. What seems a bit staid and straightforward at first reveals a subtle richness over time.</p>
<p>DeCicca's delivery, alternately grim and genial, sometimes averages out  into nonchalance, and some of the black humor in these lyrics is a bit  funnier on paper than on the record itself. But he's always been sort of  a tricky read as a singer, allowing Sayre's ever-present violin to hammer home the emotional content, and <i>Don't Blame the Stars</i> finds the two neatly complementing one another. When, on ""My Brother"", a sweetly descending string part wraps around DeCicca's sigh of ""can't forget what we've been through,"" it's devastating, but quietly so. So, too, is <i>Don't Blame the Stars.</i></p></div>"|15543.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15543-dont-blame-the-stars/|7.5|Paul Thompson

On <i>Change Is Gradual</i>, their second full-length release as Processory, Hulkkonen and Valuri are among a growing faction of revivalists taking their cues from the new romantic pop music of the 1980s. Processory's approach may be more straightforward, but like contemporaries the Tough Alliance, the goal is to write solid, accessible songs with an unusual bent, no matter what tools are at their disposal.</p>
<p>There's something wonderfully familiar about these songs; you could swear that any number of subtle synth hooks and vocal turns have been patched-in from some reimagined Tears For Fears or Spandau Ballet track. Dramatic, distant and oddly sexual, <i>Change Is Gradual</i> sounds like a surrogate soundtrack to <i>The Breakfast Club</i> if Ally Sheedy's character were the only member. And yet, there's something very current in the touchstones the duo uses to get its point across. Drums sound suspended in a viscous liquid, Hulkkonen's vocals feel specter-like, and helium-tuned synths and celestial atmospherics rise and fall with a scope reminiscent of M83.</p>
<p>But for all the retro touches, there are moments that feel positively futuristic-- for starters, the tellingly titled ""Human, Unfortunately"", which sounds like Sade for replicants, and ""Farewell, Welfare"", which features the booming voice of Big Brother monotonically rattling off a number of societal ills. The pair of songs that conclude the record (""In the Unlikely Event of an All Life Erasing Gamma-Ray Burst, This Is the Soundtrack"" and ""Adaptation For Survival"") give off an apocalyptic vibe that's also transportative: for all the earthbound carnality and desperation that floods the album, this strange final cosmic arc somehow manages to take you somewhere very far away.</p>
<p>Still, you could probably attribute all this head-tripping to the giddy exhaustion felt from listening to the whole thing in one sitting. <i>Change Is Gradual</i> is nearly as long as a feature film, and there's no getting around the fact that it can be daunting. But Hulkkonen and Valuri do their best to break up the frozen detachment, offering a few groove-centric detours. ""Take Me to Your Leader"" is a smoky, Balearic-tinged body-rocker, and ""Recovery Measures"" glides and jukes with an appealing foreignness.</p>
<p>As if that weren't enough, <i>Change Is Gradual</i> comes supported by three separate EPs, featuring remixes from heavy-hitters like Hercules and Love Affair, CFCF, and Aeroplane. The result is yet another full hour of music. Fortunately, the reinterpretations here add needed bounce while still honoring the chilled minimalism of the originals. Hannulelauri makes the most of the opportunity, putting up a remix and a dub of highlight ""Recovery Measures"" that are both faithful yet movement-minded; for pure batty fun, Pink Skull's funk-struck take on ""Take Me to Your Leader"" is the real keeper. Needless to say, <i>Change Is Gradual</i>-- not to mention the extras-- is a lot to digest, and it sometimes feels as if all this music has just mushed together in your brain. But Processory's ambition and hard work ultimately trumps the album's exhaustive length.</p></div>"|15515.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15515-change-is-gradual/|7.4|Zach Kelly

Over four songs, the Philly band's dark noise-rock, which had echoed bands like the Birthday Party, Butthole Surfers, and Killdozer, moved into catchier territory with surprising ease. Particularly impressive was singer John Sharkey III's shift to a more melodic bellow. He had hinted at this before, but his Ian Curtis-ish baritone seemed bigger and bolder.</p>
<p>Sharkey's solo project, Puerto Rico Flowers, creeps a couple of steps further from Clockcleaner, trading that band's guitar spew for soaring synths and big bass lines, and replacing punk speed with lurching mid-tempos. In the process, Sharkey approaches the dramatic 1980s goth-pop of Bauhaus, the Cure, and Depeche Mode. (The man himself <a href=""http://www.viceland.com/blogs/en/2011/06/10/rettsounds-prf-is-prf/#more-33720"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">says</a> PRF ""has more in common with Journey than any fucking cold wave band,"" but his hilarious interviews always have to be taken with a pound of salt).<span> </span><i>7'</i>s best song, <a href=""http://youtu.be/4ddkysFX5-I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""3 Sisters""</a>, could pass for a cover of the Cure's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ycl_ayPHU0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fascination Street</a>"", borrowing that song's stair-climbing bass and rolling drumbeat. But the pulse is insistent, and Sharkey's vocals (as well as his dreamy lyrics, a contrast to Clockcleaner's brutal verses) are entrancing, helping the tune avoid full-on mimicry through sheer force of will.</p>
<p>That's actually a fair way to describe the rest of <i>7. </i>Sharkey leans hard into all seven tracks-- many of which march beyond the six-minute mark-- and fills them with compelling torque that only hard-earned musical muscles can muster. So while every moment sits squarely in goth-pop mode, and each song could be compared pretty quickly to a band that was in its prime 25 years ago, Sharkey never lets you forget he's behind the wheel. The catch is you have to like the way he drives <i>and</i> the retro roads he's traversing. It's hard to imagine <i>7 </i>grabbing anyone who doesn't dig both.</p>
<p>Still, it's easy to get caught by Sharkey's hooks, especially during the final three cuts, a kind of enchanting mini-suite. The heavy float of ""Freezing Tears""-- ""Why am I freezing?"" Sharkey sings like Ian Curtis in ballad mode-- curves into the punching ""Keep Me Around"", then cascades into the beat-less closer ""After the Weekend"". That final track is the kind that lots of 80s records ended with-- a mopey meditation, complete with sad piano, that carries the album off into the fog. It's a nice fog to get lost in, but hopefully Sharkey will return with something less drenched in the past next time around.</p></div>"|15542.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15542-7/|6.8|Marc Masters

In that respect, it makes some sense to reissue the two simultaneously, but their original contexts could hardly be more different. In 1970, when advance copies of <i>McCartney</i> were sent to journalists, they included a press sheet announcing Paul's departure from the Beatles, which had the further effect of breaking up the band. <i>McCartney</i> was released a month before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13430-let-it-be/"" target=""_blank""><i>Let It Be</i></a>, and it contained a fair amount of music that had been kicking around for some time. <i>McCartney II</i>, on the other hand, was released in 1980, about a year before the breakup of Wings, a band that was never much more than a vehicle for McCartney's solo songwriting efforts.</p>
<p>Wings had no John Lennon to play foil to McCartney. Lennon and McCartney, as everyone knows, were the songwriting partners who made the Beatles such a titanic force in the 1960s. By the time the band broke up, however, the partnership had been mostly dissolved for years. The two were almost always writing separately, and on those late Beatles albums, you can hear their personalities pulling apart. The separation is complete on the solo albums the two former Beatles released in 1970. Lennon's <i>Plastic Ono Band</i> is rough, nasty, self-absorbed, not a little narcissistic, and devoted to laying bare the rawest of emotions and memories. It has overshadowed <i>McCartney</i> since its release.</p>
<p><i>McCartney</i> is a different type of album. First, let's talk about that title. This is a name that had been paired with Lennon, separated by a slash, for years-- we weren't used to seeing it all by itself. When the media ran stories on McCartney, he was often just ""Paul."" He could have called his album <i>Paul McCartney</i>, but he pointedly did not. I think he wanted people to see his name out there as a songwriting credit, without the old prefix. And the album he made has some parallels to Lennon's, too. They share a rawness, a seeming desire to move away from the opulence of 1969's <i>Abbey Road</i>, the last album the Beatles recorded together. But where the rawness of <i>Plastic Ono Band</i> plays into anger, aggression, and disillusionment, the rawness of <i>McCartney</i> is only in the sound. The record has a homespun charm, and a feel that suggests McCartney wasn't putting too much pressure on himself to carry on the Beatles flame or make a statement.</p>
<p>Paul played everything on the record himself, apart from some backing vocals by Linda, recording much of it at home on a four-track. No singles were released, there are several instrumentals, and it's all a bit ramshackle, the type of album that in the hands of most musicians would lend itself to introspection. And yet <i>McCartney</i> doesn't really tell us much about McCartney. As a songwriter, he wasn't (and still isn't, really) the confessional type. To a degree, McCartney is an actor whose medium is his songs. His love for Linda, expressed so ebulliently on ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cm2YyVZBL8U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maybe I'm Amazed</a>"", was certainly genuine, but he wrote this eventual FM-radio staple as a classic, universal love song. When presented with the opportunity to let his guard down and show us his unvarnished self, Paul McCartney never did-- even in this intimate setting, his songs remain extroverted and devoted to achieving some measure of pop accessibility.</p>
<p>The highlights of McCartney's later solo albums were often uptempo rock songs, or big, show-stopping tunes, but here, apart from ""Maybe I'm Amazed"", the peaks include two versions of the same quiet song, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLWm-m6CuCY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Junk</a>"". The sparse vocal version features McCartney accompanying himself with acoustic guitar and a bit of bass and percussion, ticking through a nostalgic inventory of disused objects. <i>McCartney</i> later reprises ""Junk"" in a ""singalong"" instrumental version, with mellotron and piano joining in for a pretty waltz. I'd be surprised if Elliott Smith didn't learn something from it. Much of the rest of the album was written and recorded off the cuff, and it shows-- McCartney plays with Latin rhythms (""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05xtvT7PLto"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Lovely Linda</a>""), a bit of blues (""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1yaIQP279k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">That Would Be Something</a>""), and some bounding, half-time country pop (""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXMCfYIT4n8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Man We Was Lonely</a>""). ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os8qC2vSEBI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Teddy Boy</a>"" is sentimental storytelling, and closer ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj8gHwArZjM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kreen-Akrore</a>"" is McCartney experimenting in his weird, humorous way with oddball drum patterns and sound effects.</p>
<p>That sort of experimentation and lack of polish was something McCartney didn't often allow himself on later solo efforts. As the 70s moved on, he got back to consciously crafting big hits, and he scored quite a few. <i>Ram</i>, <i>Venus and Mars</i>, and <i>Band on the Run</i> rank among the best Beatles solo albums, and all exhibit the kind of studio perfectionism that was absent on <i>McCartney</i>. On <i>McCartney II</i>, the polish is there, but that's partly down to improvements in home recording technology-- McCartney did much of the recording on his own at his farm in Scotland, and there's a similar low-pressure, anything-goes vibe to the final product. That said, this album is likely to be jarring for an unsuspecting McCartney or Beatles fan. It's largely experimental, devoting most of its songs to eccentric synth-pop that's just as weird as anything from the early days of new wave, and not all of it is compelling.</p>
<p><i>McCartney II</i>'s opener and first single, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEvOvdr2Fg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Coming Up</a>"", wastes no time getting right into this startling territory, with a guitar part that could have been lifted from a Talking Heads song, buzzy keyboard hooks, and vocals that find McCartney singing through a filter and backing himself up with quirky falsetto. McCartney's discography is actually filled with strange little one-offs and experiments, including late-period work with Super Furry Animals and Fireman, but this one is unusual for the way he presented it as a central part of his output rather than a side project.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the album, McCartney remains similarly difficult to pigeonhole. If I told you the instrumental ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVE0qmOfO-A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Front Parlour</a>"", with its tinny drum machine and sunny keyboard melody, was a 2009 blog hit by a lo-fi synth act, you'd likely believe me. And then there's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehqKpPmVcK4&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Temporary Secretary</a>"", a frankly irritating but still interesting song that combines frenzied synth programming with a self-consciously bizarre vocal-- McCartney sings as nasally as possible on the refrain, and tweaks it to sound robotic. Other songs turn away from this type of maximalist approach. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMtfps0H51Q&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Summer's Day Song</a>"" is pretty and sparse, featuring just McCartney and a few keyboards. TLC-presaging single ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYstxLoOnYA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Waterfalls</a>"" is even more bare, only McCartney and an electric piano, with a tiny dollop of synth and acoustic guitar.</p>
<p>Two other songs stand out on <i>McCartney II</i>, and they're as distinct from each other as this record is from <i>McCartney</i>.

In that respect, it makes some sense to reissue the two simultaneously, but their original contexts could hardly be more different. In 1970, when advance copies of <i>McCartney</i> were sent to journalists, they included a press sheet announcing Paul's departure from the Beatles, which had the further effect of breaking up the band. <i>McCartney</i> was released a month before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13430-let-it-be/"" target=""_blank""><i>Let It Be</i></a>, and it contained a fair amount of music that had been kicking around for some time. <i>McCartney II</i>, on the other hand, was released in 1980, about a year before the breakup of Wings, a band that was never much more than a vehicle for McCartney's solo songwriting efforts.</p>
<p>Wings had no John Lennon to play foil to McCartney. Lennon and McCartney, as everyone knows, were the songwriting partners who made the Beatles such a titanic force in the 1960s. By the time the band broke up, however, the partnership had been mostly dissolved for years. The two were almost always writing separately, and on those late Beatles albums, you can hear their personalities pulling apart. The separation is complete on the solo albums the two former Beatles released in 1970. Lennon's <i>Plastic Ono Band</i> is rough, nasty, self-absorbed, not a little narcissistic, and devoted to laying bare the rawest of emotions and memories. It has overshadowed <i>McCartney</i> since its release.</p>
<p><i>McCartney</i> is a different type of album. First, let's talk about that title. This is a name that had been paired with Lennon, separated by a slash, for years-- we weren't used to seeing it all by itself. When the media ran stories on McCartney, he was often just ""Paul."" He could have called his album <i>Paul McCartney</i>, but he pointedly did not. I think he wanted people to see his name out there as a songwriting credit, without the old prefix. And the album he made has some parallels to Lennon's, too. They share a rawness, a seeming desire to move away from the opulence of 1969's <i>Abbey Road</i>, the last album the Beatles recorded together. But where the rawness of <i>Plastic Ono Band</i> plays into anger, aggression, and disillusionment, the rawness of <i>McCartney</i> is only in the sound. The record has a homespun charm, and a feel that suggests McCartney wasn't putting too much pressure on himself to carry on the Beatles flame or make a statement.</p>
<p>Paul played everything on the record himself, apart from some backing vocals by Linda, recording much of it at home on a four-track. No singles were released, there are several instrumentals, and it's all a bit ramshackle, the type of album that in the hands of most musicians would lend itself to introspection. And yet <i>McCartney</i> doesn't really tell us much about McCartney. As a songwriter, he wasn't (and still isn't, really) the confessional type. To a degree, McCartney is an actor whose medium is his songs. His love for Linda, expressed so ebulliently on ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cm2YyVZBL8U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maybe I'm Amazed</a>"", was certainly genuine, but he wrote this eventual FM-radio staple as a classic, universal love song. When presented with the opportunity to let his guard down and show us his unvarnished self, Paul McCartney never did-- even in this intimate setting, his songs remain extroverted and devoted to achieving some measure of pop accessibility.</p>
<p>The highlights of McCartney's later solo albums were often uptempo rock songs, or big, show-stopping tunes, but here, apart from ""Maybe I'm Amazed"", the peaks include two versions of the same quiet song, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLWm-m6CuCY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Junk</a>"". The sparse vocal version features McCartney accompanying himself with acoustic guitar and a bit of bass and percussion, ticking through a nostalgic inventory of disused objects. <i>McCartney</i> later reprises ""Junk"" in a ""singalong"" instrumental version, with mellotron and piano joining in for a pretty waltz. I'd be surprised if Elliott Smith didn't learn something from it. Much of the rest of the album was written and recorded off the cuff, and it shows-- McCartney plays with Latin rhythms (""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05xtvT7PLto"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Lovely Linda</a>""), a bit of blues (""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1yaIQP279k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">That Would Be Something</a>""), and some bounding, half-time country pop (""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXMCfYIT4n8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Man We Was Lonely</a>""). ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Os8qC2vSEBI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Teddy Boy</a>"" is sentimental storytelling, and closer ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj8gHwArZjM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kreen-Akrore</a>"" is McCartney experimenting in his weird, humorous way with oddball drum patterns and sound effects.</p>
<p>That sort of experimentation and lack of polish was something McCartney didn't often allow himself on later solo efforts. As the 70s moved on, he got back to consciously crafting big hits, and he scored quite a few. <i>Ram</i>, <i>Venus and Mars</i>, and <i>Band on the Run</i> rank among the best Beatles solo albums, and all exhibit the kind of studio perfectionism that was absent on <i>McCartney</i>. On <i>McCartney II</i>, the polish is there, but that's partly down to improvements in home recording technology-- McCartney did much of the recording on his own at his farm in Scotland, and there's a similar low-pressure, anything-goes vibe to the final product. That said, this album is likely to be jarring for an unsuspecting McCartney or Beatles fan. It's largely experimental, devoting most of its songs to eccentric synth-pop that's just as weird as anything from the early days of new wave, and not all of it is compelling.</p>
<p><i>McCartney II</i>'s opener and first single, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieEvOvdr2Fg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Coming Up</a>"", wastes no time getting right into this startling territory, with a guitar part that could have been lifted from a Talking Heads song, buzzy keyboard hooks, and vocals that find McCartney singing through a filter and backing himself up with quirky falsetto. McCartney's discography is actually filled with strange little one-offs and experiments, including late-period work with Super Furry Animals and Fireman, but this one is unusual for the way he presented it as a central part of his output rather than a side project.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the album, McCartney remains similarly difficult to pigeonhole. If I told you the instrumental ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVE0qmOfO-A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Front Parlour</a>"", with its tinny drum machine and sunny keyboard melody, was a 2009 blog hit by a lo-fi synth act, you'd likely believe me. And then there's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehqKpPmVcK4&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Temporary Secretary</a>"", a frankly irritating but still interesting song that combines frenzied synth programming with a self-consciously bizarre vocal-- McCartney sings as nasally as possible on the refrain, and tweaks it to sound robotic. Other songs turn away from this type of maximalist approach. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMtfps0H51Q&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Summer's Day Song</a>"" is pretty and sparse, featuring just McCartney and a few keyboards. TLC-presaging single ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYstxLoOnYA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Waterfalls</a>"" is even more bare, only McCartney and an electric piano, with a tiny dollop of synth and acoustic guitar.</p>
<p>Two other songs stand out on <i>McCartney II</i>, and they're as distinct from each other as this record is from <i>McCartney</i>. Album closer ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STAnruigcG8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">One of These Days</a>"" is simply great, benefiting from a rudimentary approach that strips away the synths and drum machines that dominate <i>McCartney II</i>. Bonus track ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9ieDAE3yIU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Secret Friend</a>"", included on the second disc of this reissue, is also pretty jaw-dropping-- a 10-minute, beat-driven synth opus that shares plenty in common aesthetically with dance music a decade its junior.

Their output is prolific and their live show combustible. But on <i>Castlemania</i>, Dwyer opts to go it alone. With the exception of live-band regular Brigid Dawson-- who, along with the Sandwitches' Heidi Alexander, contributes some backing vocals-- the shaggy-banged songwriter handles almost all of the instruments. Drummer Mike Shoun and Guitarist Petey Dammit aren't out of the picture permanently. They're just off-duty until the fall, when Thee Oh Sees are scheduled to release yet another full-length record.</p>
<p><i>Castlemania</i> is a fairly introspective affair, at least by Oh Sees standards. It's Dywer's most melodious batch of songs since 2006's mostly acoustic <i>Cool Death of the Island Raiders</i>. Without the heavy full-band artillery he leans toward skewed bubble-gum pop, fleshing out the guitars and drums with flutes, bells and thrift store synths. It was recorded, at least in part, at Dywer's former group house. ""This here is the last record worked on at 608c Haight Street in San Francisco (very near and dear to my heart and heavy in my memories) before control was assumed by rich assholes,"" he writes in the liner notes.</p>
<p>Not that this is Thee Oh Sees' answer to <i>Nebraska</i>. Even at his most reflective, Dwyer's songwriting retains a sinister, ""Sesame Street""-on-LSD sensibility-- simple melodies and creepy lyrics, frequently delivered in a whacked-out monster-voice. ""It don't feel too good to be dead in the 21st century/ I am dirt but I can be/ A home for wayward hungry seeds,"" Dwyer growls on ""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/INeedSeed.mp3"" target=""_blank"">I Need Seed</a>"", deploying a Looney Tunes-worthy narrative in a song about death. It's summery <span>retro nuggets </span>pinned into the red, shot through with a healthy dose of drugs and dread, while ""Pleasure Blimps"" finds him singing of machines stripping away flesh over shimmering glockenspiel lines and 12-string guitars.</p>
<p>All in all, <i>Castlemania</i> is a fairly loose and scattered record. There are plenty of oddball tangents, including a stripped-down and spooky cover of West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band's ""I Won't Hurt You"" and the forlorn mellotron and sax instrumental, ""The Horse Was Lost"". Songs frequently melt down into racket rather than stop on a dime. But it's good to hear Dwyer step away from his backing band's big guns, if only for a moment.</p></div>"|15540.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15540-castlemania/|7.6|Aaron Leitko

At least partially responsible for the spread of influential house and disco sounds to England, the Cambridge-born Bassett spent the 1990s booking DJs like Larry Levan in London and holding supposedly awesome residencies at a handful of influential clubs. These days, Bassett resides in Los Angeles where he hosts his epic, invite-only Sarcastic Disco parties. Suffice to say that if it was dance music and it was created in the 1980s or 1990s, Bassett was on that shit before you.</p>
<p>Not that Bassett wasn't making music as well; he was just doing so sporadically and seemingly in deference to his career as a party-starter of unimpeachable taste. <i>DJ Harvey Presents Locussolus</i> represents the first time in Bassett's 20-year career that a full-length CD of his work will be available (he released a Late Night Sessions mix for London's Ministry of Sound in 1996). (It's a fitting title, ""Locus Solus"" being the private estate of a mad scientist in Raymond Roussel's novel of the same name.) It's not a proper album-- not even particularly close-- rather a collection of the three <i>Locussolus</i> 12""s he has released since 2010. One new track, ""Bloodbath"", and remixes by the likes of Andrew Weatherall and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15857-i-want-it-lindstrm-prins-thomas-remix/"" target=""_blank"">Lindstrom &amp; Prins Thomas</a> round out the collection.</p>
<p>Sequenced cleverly, <i>Locussolus</i> actually functions well as a long player. If you close your eyes and forget the track titles, the fact that ""Gunship"" is just one track removed from a remix of itself makes it sound more like a variation on a theme rather than CD padding. Bassett is all over the dance music map, but he mostly sticks to the sounds of mid-80s electro and house, with heavy doses of Ze Records hippie-dust. It is a beguiling and slippery mix. During Weatherall's dubby ""Gunship"" remix, as a lunatic rants about hams in the middle of the street (20 listens later and I'm still flipping a coin to decide if this is a metaphor), I am certain I am listening to electronic music and that DJ Harvey made this music, but little else. <i>Locussolus</i> isn't immersive; rather, it commands your attention without making a fuss about it. ""I Want It"" checks of most of the ""classic house"" boxes-- thick, salty basslines, insistent kick drums, reverberating synth pads-- but Bassett's banal, circular back-and-forth with a female voice gives the track life as it morphs into a (G-)funky strut. ""Tan Sedan"" steams forward as a sci-fi floor-filler, its UFO-synths jamming languorously over its lock-step bassline.</p>
<p>Bassett isn't a sonic radical, just a hip, studied craftsman unafraid to let his freak flag fly. For those of us not privy to Harvey's parties-- old or new-- <i>Locussolus</i> is a treat: a document of one of dance music's behind-the-scenes/decks all-stars. That's where Harvey made his name, but this set proves that he has plenty to offer as a producer as well. A late-career burst of activity would be welcome, but there's no use getting ahead of ourselves. Enjoy <i>Locussolus</i> for its loose, loving swagger, a rare transmission from inside Bassett's private, mad utopia.</p></div>"|15501.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15501-locussolus/|7.3|Andrew Gaerig

Sure, the music sets a mood-- so what? But for something to fade gracefully into the scenery, it has to be finely crafted enough that nothing snags or jars. Unobtrusiveness isn't always a fault, nor is attention-grabbing necessarily a virtue. I realized this one afternoon last summer at a BBQ, where Vetiver's 2009 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12674-tight-knit/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tight Knit</i></a> was playing at low volume from another room, providing the perfect sonic wallpaper for the day: gentle folk songs drifting into not-quite-yacht rock-- wooden ship rock, maybe. The album didn't grab your attention so much as gently hold your interest, complementing rather than interfering. Paradoxically, half-listening to the album revealed something that giving it full focus did not. It was like some ""Doctor Who"" creature that you could see in peripheral vision but which disappears when you look directly at it.</p>
<p>Vetiver's new album, their fifth (and second for Sub Pop), pulls off much the same trick. This is part sound design:The drums are muted, often no more than a muffled kick pulse; the guitars are finger-picked acoustic or else electric with the edges slicked entirely off; and singer/songwriter Andy Cabic holds his vowels long and lofty, sighing his lyrics as much as singing them. It's also part songwriting: Cabic's melodies are impeccably understated, and his leisurely lyrics set an undeniably easy-going mood. This sort of thing has been Vetiver's lane since their anomalously freak-folky <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8528-vetiver/"" target=""_blank"">debut</a>, and there's not much here in the way of either deviations or dramatic leaps forward; if Cabic and longtime producer Thom Monahan have tinkered with the band's sound, their improvements are subtle enough as to be imperceptible.</p>
<p>Of course, given time, the best background music insinuates its way into your foreground, and after about a week with <i>The Errant Charm</i>, a few of its highlights will work their way into a listener's head: the way Cabic's vocal traces the guitar scale on the chorus of ""Worse for Wear""; the cruising JJ Cale vibe of ""Ride, Ride, Ride""; the deck chair-ready guitar glide of ""Fog Emotion""; the soft organ trill and backbeat to ""Can't You Tell"". Best of all is ""<a href=""http://assets2.subpop.com/assets/audio/9542.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wonder Why</a>"", an upbeat and unreservedly catchy number, driven by bright guitar picking backed by piano, bobbing bass, chords that rev up to the chorus, and the album's most straight-ahead, snare-hitting drumming. Over the top of it, Cabic harmonizes and hums, world-weary and a little worried, but still sounding largely optimistic.</p>
<p>Presumably if Cabic-- formerly of dub percussionists Tussle and frequent touring sideman of Devendra Banhart-- just wanted to make an ambient drone album, it would certainly be within his powers, and it would probably be fine. But his songs as Vetiver, for all their breezy lightness, seem to aspire to something more like the spotlight, or at least the talking-stick spot at the campfire. <i>The Errant Charm</i> doesn't entirely succeed in that regard, but it remains a pleasant listen, perhaps just a bit too subliminally so for its own good.</p></div>"|15537.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15537-the-errant-charm/|6.4|Eric Grandy

It comes with the territory. You make subtle music to begin with, and like any artist you feel the burden of not wanting to repeat yourself. Kyle Bobby Dunn clearly feels this burden. He's been making drone records since 2002, and since 2005 he's released a fairly steady stream of albums, EPs, limited cassettes, and other small-run recordings. So he's covered a lot of ground within his style already.</p>
<p><i>Ways of Meaning</i> sticks to what we already know Dunn does well: patient drone. But it does it differently from anything he's released before. It's his least varied and most musically active album, though that's not quite as paradoxical as it may sound. Here, Dunn is focused on a certain type of rounded, pillow-soft tone that has the feel of cold, clear air, or in its more active moments, the play of light underwater. But there's a lot you can do with those types of sounds, and Dunn does a lot over 40 minutes. With one exception, he keeps the pieces short and homed-in on a single idea, leaving behind both the rougher, organic tones and the longer structures of much of his past work.</p>
<p>The album opens with a pair of pieces that move in opposite directions to explore dissonance and consonance. No music made with the sounds Dunn uses could ever be described as harsh, but ""Dropping Sandwiches (in Chester Lake)"" manages to make them slightly unsettling by combining them in strange harmonies. The purity of the tones and half-empty texture of the music have a strange effect on the dissonant harmony, though-- rather than coalescing into a sour chord, the notes seem to hang next to each other in gentle disagreement. Tones overlap on ""Canyon Meadows"" with a rhythm roughly equivalent to wind chimes-- there appears to be no set meter for the comings and goings of individual tones, but the clamor as they emerge and disappear still constitutes a harmonious whole.</p>
<p>The one long track, ""Movement for the Completely Fucked"", essentially stretches the rest of the album's approach across 15 slowly drifting minutes. ""Drifting"" is really the right word for it, too. When I think of more ballasted drone music, like that of Stars of the Lid, I think of ""shifting,"" because those sounds seem like they'd take some effort to move. But these feel like they might blow away and drift forever if you let go. <i>Ways of Meaning</i> is drone music with a light touch and the gravity turned off.</p></div>"|15523.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15523-ways-of-meaning/|7.1|Joe Tangari

The first, of course, was his thought-it-would-never-happen rapprochement with longtime estranged partner J. Mascis in Dinosaur Jr. And then Sebadoh, the one-man-project turned full-blown band, found its second and best-loved line-up coming together again late last decade. The early Sebadoh records were purposefully fuzzy, mumbly things, full of raw pop yearning that was sometimes pretty hard to make out through all the hiss and crackle. Though they were key documents in the rise of lo-fi as a distinct movement in 1990s American indie, it's probably not coincidental that the word ""weed"" appeared prominently in several of the band's early releases, which often literally sound like the product of a baked mind and a four-track, flip-flopping between silliness and vein-opening.</p>
<p>As Sebadoh became more of a democracy, the clashing urges of the various songwriters (Barlow, bassist Jason Loewenstein, second guitarist Eric Gaffney, who left before <i>Bakesale</i>) turned the full-band's first few records into sometimes frustrating (the CD skip button was made for these sort of jumbles) and sometimes beguiling (they had a real way with an anthemic pop-punk hook when they wanted to) collisions of styles. Pure indie-pop instincts fought with an urge toward experimental cassette tape fucking around. Bouncy power-chord jams rubbed up against shameless acoustic mopery. By <i>Bakesale</i> in 1994, they'd already written a couple of undeniable anthems with ""Gimme Indie Rock"" and ""Brand New Love"", the latter an instant-classic covered by peers like Superchunk in what seemed like seconds after it's release. But <i>Bakesale</i> was the first Sebadoh album where the power-chords and anthems seemed to win out. It was, and remains, their most focused and purely pleasurable record.</p>
<p>The early- and mid-90s were great years for albums that brought punk's two-minute punchiness together with the earnest relationship laments that briefly defined that slippery terrain known as indie rock. And <i>Bakesale</i> is one of the era's best. If it's got fewer romance-gone-wrong epics than Superchunk's <i>Foolish</i> and lacks the emphatic guitar-snarl of Archers of Loaf's <i>Icky Mettle</i>, it combines bits of both tendencies into 15 songs that rarely outstay their welcome. Unlike Sebadoh's scattershot early albums, it works as a brief, memorable whole. The band probably wasn't trying to make a statement-- that sort of ran counter to the whole aesthetic back then-- but by tightening up and aiming for clarity, they managed one anyway. ""Feels good just to bitch about it,"" from ""Magnet's Coil"", is one of those lines that defines a certain part of early indie's appeal, where kids-like-you kvetched about their foibles and fears in an unpretentious way. But the album's frantic pace, where even the slow songs feel like urgent expulsions of heartbreak, defines the other side of indie's appeal. At its best, all that emoting was delivered with a healthy shot of energy that felt necessary given the sluggish tempos of alt-rock radio at the time.</p>
<p><i>Bakesale</i> sounds a little brighter on this remaster, though this isn't an album where you're really looking for crisp and distinct-in-the-mix instrumental interplay. Its opening three-song blast, all tumbling drums and jittery-but-beefy noise-pop guitar, is an obvious attempt to grab the attention of a new generation of kids who'd sprang up to embrace feelings-and-feedback. But even the somber stuff, like the ""Not a Friend"" to ""Dreams"" run early on, features strong, clear hooks instead of burying things in murk. This isn't to say the album is clean, at least not in the way indie records routinely are these days. But it's also not ""lo-fi"" in the indistinct or noise-obliterated way we've come to know. Without sacrificing the music's rough edges, the band was up enough on its hook-game that ""Rebound"" briefly hung around modern rock radio, Barlow's first unexpected minor-league hit until Folk Implosion's ""Natural One"" became the really unexpected hit a few years later.</p>
<p>So <i>Bakesale</i> itself remains a strong and lovable essay on 90s indie's charms. But what of the expected and extensive bonus material? Well, in bearing-down to make a no-filler album, it's pretty clear that Sebadoh's goof-off and boo-hoo sides went into the singles, EPs, and ancillary material from the same era. Tunes (using the word very loosely) like ""MOR Backlash"", ""Foreground"", and ""Drumstick Jumble"" sound like the ""wacky"" bedroom sound-collage filler they would have been if they'd been included on <i>Bakesale</i>, and acoustic demo takes of ""Not a Friend"" and ""Mystery Man"" prove how quickly charming sensitivity can give way to unfortunate sad-sack territory when you strip away the electric oomph of the album versions. (Though the acoustic ""Magnet's Coil"" and ""Rebound"" prove they could hit you without any amplification.) Despite a few strong songs like ""Punching Myself in the Face Repeatedly, Publicly"" and ""Sing Something/Plate of Hatred"" that can almost stand with the album's best, these <i>Bakesale</i> add-ons will mostly be of value to those who loved Sebadoh's first few years of all-over-the-place wildness, but it's not as if their second-disc inclusion can dull the parent album's punch.</p></div>"|15522.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15522-bakesale-deluxe-edition/|8.5|Jess Harvell

""This Caretaker album is built from layers of sampled 78s and albums,"" James Kirby told me in an email recently. ""Things have been rearranged in places and other things brought in and out of focus. Surface noise""-- which is abundant-- ""is from the original vinyls.""</p>
<p>Kirby is an artist whose concepts are sometimes more fun to engage with than his music. As V/Vm-- a project he started in the early 1990s-- he made grotesque edits of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ofp0a-Qwk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">soft-pop songs</a> and released an entire 7"" of the sounds of pigs feeding. His albums as the Caretaker have been comparatively more subdued, tending toward ambient music made from preexisting recordings.</p>
<p><span><i>Bliss </i>was inspired by a <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100512112314.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2010 study</a> suggesting that Alzheimer's patients have an easier time remembering information when it's placed in the context of music. What makes it unique isn't that Kirby resuscitates old but vaguely familiar source material; it's how he edits it. Several of the tracks here take pretty, anodyne phrases and loop them mindlessly; several stop in what feels like mid-thought; several reach back and then jump forward. They never feel filled-in from start to finish, and they tend to linger on moments that feel especially comforting or conclusive: the last flourishes of a song, maybe, the pat on the shoulder, the part when we're assured everything is drawing to a close. Kirby isn't just making nostalgic music, he's making music that mimics the fragmented and inconclusive ways our memories work.<br/></span></p>
<p>Unlike Kirby's last few albums, whether as the Caretaker or Leyland Kirby, <i>Bliss</i> isn't dissonant or heavy-handed. Nobody has to remind me that losing my memory is upsetting, or that I'm losing it as I type, or that the loss will probably accelerate as I get older, or that I'll probably spend my final hours sitting by a window repeating myself. <span>What I like about <i>Bliss</i> is that, as the title suggests, there's something at least metaphorically beautiful-- even slightly funny-- about living inside a locked groove, dancing with nobody.</span></p>
<p><span>The last five years or so have been filled with music that feels haunted by an unresolved moment or looks at the past from a crooked perspective. The <a href=""http://www.ghostbox.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghost Box</a> label has been consistently good at making jigsaw puzzles from cultural memories; Ariel Pink's grotesque soft-rock finally has an audience-- even music by a producer like Burial relies on the intrusion of a voice that sounds more part of history than the present, something reaching forward from a time we thought was gone.</span> Kirby isn't unaware of what he's doing here-- everything he's put out in the past few years plays around with these ideas directly, down to his choice of titles (2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13891-sadly-the-future-is-no-longer-what-it-once-was/"" target=""_blank"">Sadly, the Future Is No Longer What It Was</a> </i>being the most impressively gymnastic). Even calling himself ""The Caretaker""-- a reference to the endlessly recurring ballroom parties of <i>The Shining-- </i>feels like an effort to suss out the inherently psychedelic <span>properties</span> of memory.</p>
<p><i>Bliss</i> reminds me of Ekkehard Ehlers' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AtYyofOKk0&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Plays John Cassavetes 2""</a> and Gavin Bryars' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZaa7EhKUMY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jesus' Blood Never Failed Me Yet""</a>, two pieces that transcend high-concept nostalgia. ""Cassavetes"" is a layered loop of the opening string figure from the Beatles' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EoQVaQGXmM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Good Night""</a>, and the Bryars piece-- which was explored <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/resonant-frequency/7810-resonant-frequency-70/"">in a column</a> here last year-- is a loop of a homeless man singing a hymn as an orchestra gradually builds behind him. In both cases, the actual amount of musical material is relatively small, and the ""work"" done on the part of the composer is minimal-- even Bryars' 30-minute build consists mostly of consonant drones.</p>
<p>Bryars' and Ehlers' conceptual leap was to wear their moments out as completely as possible. Repetitive music has a way of dissolving a listener's ability to pay attention to it: by the end, Ehlers' and Bryars' pieces sound different from the beginning, but there's no part I can point to in them and say, ""here, here's where things change for good."" They're constantly changing. They're also constantly returning. With Kirby, the effect is even more subtle and confusing. ""Libet's Delay"", sounds like it confuses its end for its beginning (or vice versa), and ""Mental Caverns Without Sunshine"" appears twice, with a two-minute song in-between: It's as though Kirby is trying to trick you into experiencing <i>déjà vu</i>. In all three cases, the source material is music designed not only to comfort, but to sound like it existed before you: hymns, love songs, lullabies. <i>Bliss</i> is eerie because it takes the seduction of those forms and turns it slightly askew; there's something unsettling about the musical equivalent of a permanent smile.</p></div>"|15518.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15518-an-empty-bliss-beyond-this-world/|8.2|Mike Powell

The fact-shy producer is apparently now settled in Manchester, but there's a sense of disconnection that remains integral to his ghostly productions. There's a strong sense of loneliness in the swarm of sampled vocals that make up the spine of the tracks on <i>With U</i>, reflecting both in the way Holy Other treats his sources and the mixture of genres he pulls from.</p>
<p>Take the title track, which shuffles out from a poppy, electronic piano sample in a motif that is at once disarmingly gentle and slightly creepy. As skittering rhythms pan from left to right, a pitched-down vocal bathes the track in darkness, and ""with you"" is the only discernable lyric as the sample repeats. The track has a yearning sound, each element working to intensify that feeling, from the off-kilter piano line to the vaporous layers of reverb. That echoing atmosphere is abundant on the EP and has a knack for making Holy Other's production seem tantalizingly half-solid and transient.</p>
<p>""Touch"" uses the same kind of tricks with a lithe vocal line at the heart of the track. This time, the voice sounds closer to the kind of manipulations Burial mined <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlEkvbRmfrA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">so successfully</a> on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10877-untrue/"" target=""_blank""><i>Untrue</i></a>. That kind of skewed affectation has been a common device in electronic music since then, but something about Holy Other's cloud of overlapping vocal samples gives it a different, more romantic feel. While that busier vocal work makes up the bulk of the track, an ominous bass line thunders deep in the mix, gliding slowly from note to note. The drop is one of the more noticeable signifiers from witch house and aligns Holy Other more strongly with other Tri Angle Records artists Balam Acab and oOoOO.</p>
<p>The glacial drag of those artists is reflected again on closing track ""Feel Something"", with its starkly contrasting bass and trebly keys. It shares the listlessness and detached atmosphere common in this scene, but once again Holy Other's use of vocals pulls the track somewhere unexpected. This time, the sample hews closer to its native pitch and feels all the more striking for it. Transplanted out of its original context, the latent sensuality and drama in the vocals are squeezed down to their stark essence.</p>
<p>On first listen, the haze of <i>With U</i> can seem pro forma, but diving deeper beneath the surface reveals a deceptively fragmented record made up of enticing titbits and interesting juxtapositions. It's a strangely affecting synthesis of sounds and marks Holy Other's short debut out as a darkly oppressive but ultimately rewarding piece of work.</p></div>"|15531.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15531-with-u-ep/|7.6|Hari Ashurst

As arguably the biggest name on the Definitive Jux roster, Aesop made for an unlikely star, but I can vividly remember the hordes of hoodied, stubble-headed, tough-looking suburban and outer-borough kids who'd cram into clubs and roar along with his bent, cluttered, wriggling lyrical abstractions. Aesop was and is a born cult figure, his sleepy stoner charisma intersecting just right with his berserk linguistic flights. And in the Def Jux world of clattering psych-rap production and elaborate sci-fi packaging, he did more than fit in; he stood above.</p>
<p>The Aesop era seems like it's been over for a few years, and there are a few reasons for that. Rap moves fast, and we're seeing a whole new wave of Internet-borne young rap iconoclasts; old cults give way to new ones. Definitive Jux, a label built at least partly on gorgeous packaging and object fetishization, wasn't built for today's world; it effectively <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/37778-definitive-jux-goes-on-hiatus/"" target=""_blank"">closed up shop</a> last year. But mostly, Aesop just hasn't been around. He released his last album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10583-none-shall-pass/"" target=""_blank""><i>None Shall Pass</i></a>, in 2007, and where he once guested on virtually every album that his scene produced, his verses have become less and less frequent. So it's truly refreshing to see Aesop return in pleasantly low-stakes form, as one of three guys in the new group Hail Mary Mallon. On <i>Are You Gonna Eat That?</i>, Aesop and co-conspirators Rob Sonic and DJ Big Wiz don't exactly let up on the brain-addling lyrical and musical density. But the album isn't some grand statement. They sound exactly like what they are: three guys off in a room somewhere, making rap music and having fun doing it.</p>
<p>Rob Sonic is an old Def Jux labelmate of Aesop's, and to say they've got chemistry might be understating things a bit. For stretches of the album, they practically sound like the same person. Rob's been getting Aesop comparisons for years, and his style is truly similar; like Aesop, he raps in tumbling nasal syllable-clumps, blasting us with one obscure image and then moving onto another before our brains have caught up. His delivery is a bit less guttural and more straightforwardly laid back, but he's got the same commitment to fucking with our collective head. (The first line of Rob's first verse on the album: ""Leopard print Speedo on the FDR, saying 'Follow that car!'."") Rob and Aesop jointly produced the album, and their combined style is a psychedelic knock familiar to anyone who ever paid attention to Def Jux: fuzzed-out guitars fighting for space with sputtering cluster-bombs of drums. But there's also a variation to it; the album's over in 41 minutes, and the tracks jump restlessly from one idea to the next. Choruses are rare; Big Wiz's precise, musical scratches usually play that role. And there's not a single rapping guest on the album; this is strictly a family affair.</p>
<p>At times, they sound like they're having <i>too</i> much fun; the absurdist 808 thud of ""Grubstake"" and the intentionally annoying chipmunk voices of ""Breakdance Beach"" were probably more enjoyable to record than they are to hear. But there's real joy in hearing Aesop and Rob compete to see who can come up with the most inscrutably memorable turn of phrase. (Aesop wins on ""Garfield"": ""Document the war of the department-store Santas from the POV of cameras hid in the dog's antlers."") About a decade after the Def Jux boom, it's almost comfort food to hear these guys slip-sliding over bent beats like these, but it's still a heady, potent experience. And it reaches a peak on final track ""Plagues and Bacon"", on which Aesop tries out a double-time flow over a twisting speedball of a psych-dance beat. These guys may not be back in their ambition-heavy fighting form on <i>Are You Gonna Eat That?</i>, but they're back to rapping just for the fuck of it, and that can be a beautiful thing to hear. And hearing the album, it's immediately apparent that Aesop is still a major talent, someone who can do whatever the hell he wants and get away with it.</p>
<p>Aesop's next album might be a collaborative thing with Moldy Peaches member Kimya Dawson, and that's a confounding prospect but also an intriguing one. <i>Are You Gonna Eat That? </i>is a retrenchment move, but that's OK. But once Aesop returns to full-on bent-experimentalist mode, that's when he could really become a force again.</p></div>"|15530.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15530-are-you-gonna-eat-that/|6.7|Tom Breihan

On ""Swallow the Sea"" she hits on a possible explanation: ""Maybe it's our convict blood,"" posits the refrain, a clever and poignant nod to Cooper's and bandmate Damon Cox's Australian heritage. Perhaps that's not the most scientific rationale for why the duo's songs are full of so much heartache and dissolution, but it's the best one An Horse offer, unless you count the time in ""Not Mine"" where Cooper admits, ""That's enough 'Twin Peaks' for one night.""</p>
<p>These moments of self-awareness and cheek stick out because Cooper spends much of <i>Walls</i> navel-gazing and mired in helplessness. As a result, the success of the album's songs is pretty much directly proportional to how much of a riffy ruckus they kick up to bolster Cooper's bum trips. An Horse may seem superficially limited with only two members and a stripped-down reliance on guitar and drums, but the duo still manages to range impressively between indie-rock anthemics and straight-up punk-pop blasts. The punky stuff is the most fun of course-- ""Airport Death"", ""Trains and Tracks"", and ""Leave Me"" invite favorable Sleater-Kinney comparisons in the marriage of Cooper's aggrieved, plaintive vocals and the music's ripping uptempo blur. Even with more space to breathe, though, An Horse prove capable of powerful songcraft, taking a more ruminative but still rousing emo-indie tack on ""Dressed Sharply"" and ""Know This, We've Noticed"", songs that show you why the band made a worthy opening act to Death Cab for Cutie in 2008.</p>
<p>The back half of <i>Walls</i> finds An Horse's music propping up Cooper with decreased verve, and the results are accordingly hit or miss. Her heartsick complaints can grab you by the throat when the band's pleading too, but midtempo meanders and subdued strummers tend to make the whole effect downright grating, with the title track and closing ""Tiny Skeletons"" being the worst offenders (though the pretty acoustic detour ""Windows in the City"" is a notable exception). <i>Walls</i> is still a likeable and engaging album on the whole, but it's hard not to be a tad worried that An Horse's debut album began with a song where Cooper fiercely and endearingly sang, ""And like that good Hole album/ I can live through this,"" while its follow-up ends with a song where she mewls, ""Ian Curtis said it would tear us apart.""</p></div>"|15520.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15520-walls/|6.4|Joshua Love

They'd mastered the intricate rhythmic syncopations of UK garage and Timbaland-style R&amp;B, genres that had turned inventive and impossibly tricky rhythm programming into a game of pop oneupsmanship. Which is hardly the sort of thing that you'd want to hear an amateur's take on. But JBs' music was presented as if it were something fragile, homespun, made on a shoestring, full of negative space where the pop fizziness should be. It added an interesting, affecting friction to a sound that had defined glossy marquee pop around the turn of the millennium, like the difference between a love song written to please millions and one aimed at a special someone.</p>
<p>Pretty quickly, though, on 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9301-so-this-is-goodbye/"" target=""_blank""><i>So This Is Goodbye</i></a> and especially 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12896-begone-dull-care/"" target=""_blank""><i>Begone Dull Care</i></a>, the JBs music started sounding like a million bucks, whatever it cost to make. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing. There had always been an element of slick soulful 1980s synth-pop in their sound, and when they jettisoned the new millennium R&amp;B touches, it was shocking and enjoyable to find out they actually had the production chops to mimic that 1980s opulence.  But what about that one-on-one intimacy that had originally made them stand out? In that sense, <i>It</i>'<i>s All True</i> sounds like the album the Junior Boys have been moving toward their whole career. It's got the same low-key mixtape-from-a-lover charm as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4340-last-exit/"" target=""_blank""><i>Last Exit</i></a>, but sacrifices none of the appealing slickness of their last few albums.</p>
<p>Opener ""Itchy Fingers"" is actually a bit of bait-and-switch. It's the most deliriously dense tune on the album-- multiple basslines, stuttering R&amp;B breakdowns, Art of Noise vocal stabs, zapping rave riffs, gleaming Japan/Duran-style guitar-- a master class in just how much you can squeeze into a track without its seeming cluttered. It recalls the carefully plotted textural overload of UK funky producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29511-ill-blu/"" target=""_blank"">Ill Blu</a>, even if the feel is still more disco-house smooth than frantic Jamaican ragga. But ""Itchy Fingers"" is more or less an anomaly. <i>It</i>'<i>s All True</i> mostly dials back the sonic excess in favor of more streamlined grooves. Thankfully, the album also corrects the lack-of-hooks problem that occasionally plagued <i>Begone Dull Care</i>. ""Second Chance"" is still stuffed with whirling video game noises, and some glorious creamy vocal multi-tracking, but what stands out on first listen is that naggingly catchy bassline. Plus Jeremy  Greenspan gives us his best batch of choruses in quite a while, and good thing, too. While this is still headphone music par excellence, all those gleaming little sonic gewgaws and sneaky ear-worm off-beats are often pushed to the back of the mix, meaning the bright lounging-on-the-yacht electro hooks and Greenspan's voice both have to do a lot more work here.</p>
<p>Greenspan's singing is the best it's ever been on <i>It</i>'<i>s All True</i>, proving the band's mixing desk skills aren't the only thing that's matured over the past eight years. Where he initially sounded wounded and winsome, almost hiding his voice behind the stark beats, here he displays a bouncy, strident sense of playfulness. Just check the ecstatic peak-after-peak outro on ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12183-banana-ripple/"" target=""_blank"">Banana Ripple</a>"". There's also a new subtlety to his breathy just-out-of-bed tenderness that weirdly reminds me of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3724-the-sea-and-cake/"" target=""_blank"">Sam Prekop</a>, no faint praise considering Prekop is the reigning master of this sort of thing. And speaking of subtle and tender, along with the large helpings of dancefloor joy, some of the album's most immediately arresting moments are its sparsest and most fragile. ""The Reservoir"" is an ultra-delicate experiment in seeing how far a rhythm can be stripped back-- something that would have fit perfectly on <i>Last Exit</i>, though it sounds far richer  here, with Greenspan pulling off a falsetto he never would have been able to in the old days. Despite a few curveballs, like the pinpoint precise homage to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a> and the bleep techno Kraftwerk inspired on ""Kick the Can"", there's not much ""new"" here if you've been following the Junior Boys' sound over the last decade. But considering they seem to have <i>perfected</i> that sound here, it's hard not to feel like they should keep making albums like <i>It</i>'<i>s All True</i> for a long, long time.</p></div>"|15507.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15507-its-all-true/|7.8|Jess Harvell

Shadow could be excused for testing his limits, for reacting to the sounds currently reverberating through the instrumental hip-hop arena he helped build. And it's tempting to speculate what his next move might be. He could be ricocheting off recent psychedelic L.A. bass music, or trying to see how his beat-building/breakdown technique could spar against UK funky rhythms, or maybe just stripping things back to the point of minimalism.<span> </span>The fact that he's calling his upcoming album <i>The Less You Know, the Better</i> says something about his M.O., at least.</p>
<p>Then again, the <i>I Gotta Rokk </i>EP contains a few singles drawn from that album, and they suggest a new direction more along the lines of what people expected from him 10 years ago. Any of the three original tracks on this EP would've fit well stylistically as follow-ups to the prog-skewing aspirations of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2373-the-private-press/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Private Press</i></a>, representing a gradual evolution from his sample-virtuoso approach. As they stand in 2011, these songs are a bit of a mixed bag, flirting with sounds that could qualify as trendy or forward-thinking in bass music without jumping into the thick of it.</p>
<p>It's not so much the scattershot styles that register as strange; if there's anywhere hard rock, psych-folk, and electro-glitch all share a root context, it's in the scrapyard assemblage of an ecclectic cratedigger like Shadow. It's more of a structural disconnect, where it's possible to hear what he's reaching for but harder to grasp just how he plans to get there. The title track lurches around in a stoner-rock plod, as a creeping armada of metal guitars eventually bleeds through its slow build to a manic false-ending. The hesher trappings are novel enough, but its drums are uniquely Shadow's: clipped yet heavy-sounding snares, hi-hats, and claps that sound culled from a dozen long-buried sources, but which coalesce into a dense vortex of percussion.</p>
<p>The other two originals debuted last year as a digital single, and if they're both distinctly Shadow, they also prove how nebulous that descriptor really is. ""I've Been Trying"" leans toward the same vaguely soulful psych-folk that informed ""Six Days"" and ""This Time (I'm Gonna Try It My Way)"", but it sounds less like an actual sample-based construction than a song with overdubs-- it's one of those cuts that might feel more alive if the seams were less concealed. ""Def Surrounds Us"" is the more intriguing proposition, Shadow loosely toying with dubstep in a somewhat self-aware mode. The Southern-bounce digital snare rolls and hornet-sting synthesizers approach Benga's more jittery moments, but only until the song takes a left turn into glitchy drum'n'bass. It may be the most manic thing he's done since the similarly structured ""Napalm Brain/Scatter Brain"", and it's proof positive that he can still do exhilarating, spectacular things with drum breaks.</p>
<p>Out of three additional remixes, the one that pulls it off the best ironically has the weakest source material: Various' take on ""I've Been Trying"" scatters that track's weedy vocals into lonely dub echoes, bringing out the same sense of isolation with a completely different mood. The other two-- Irn Mnky's Pendulum-style ""Swagger Mix"" of ""I Gotta Rokk"" and Rockwell's twitchy, overstuffed remix of ""Def Surrounds Us""-- show just how tacky contemporary drum'n'bass bombast can be, weirdly managing to use all the prominent elements of their originals to create remixes that miss all the things that make Shadow's tracks slice instead of bludgeon. <span>At least the first three tracks prove that Shadow himself still knows how that approach works.</span></p></div>"|15525.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15525-i-gotta-rokk-ep/|7.0|Nate Patrin

That might seem like a backhanded compliment, the way you'd describe music that's suited for a dinner party or a Sunday afternoon, but never something you'd seek out or throw on the stereo simply for personal pleasure. But <i>Lobelia</i>, named for a flower Jantz' parents used in homeopathic remedies, is the sort of album that, if you hear it once, you'll only want to hear again and again. It's immersive and personal music, continually unfolding and forever revealing. Jantz prefers atmosphere to extravagance, using these 52 minutes to create a dozen moods instead of a half-dozen quick hits or technical workouts. He's created an open audio diary of sorts, something to keep exploring and discovering-- the quintessentially nice and easy instrumental album you hope never ends.</p>
<p>With a careful mix of banjo, guitar, field recordings, and electronics, Jantz carefully paints short, bittersweet scenes of domestic life. ""Summer Street"" might be an appropriate title for a lithe, summer-of-fun jangle, but for Jantz, it's the score for waves of heat rising from blacktop, for the languid days of high heat and low activity. ""Porch Screens"" filters an old country guitar tune through a scrim of psychedelic distortion, the tones washing out into a serene glow. During ""Falling Off Your Bike"", hazy guitar notes fall through tape fuzz and slide guitar moans, while ""The Quarry Slide"" is a jubilant builder, moving from a momentary cycle of apprehension to a dance shuffle in only five minutes. ""The Bee's Nest"" appropriately buzzes, but Jantz plucks a sprightly, comfortable melody above the hum. Even the most threatening sights feel like home, he suggests. These pieces are like old postcards, with predictable images warped by the very personal contexts of the messages scribbled on the back. Like Alessandro Stefana's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10245-poste-y-telegrafi/"" target=""_blank""><i>Poste e Telegrafi</i></a>, the Books' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/855-the-lemon-of-pink/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Lemon of Pink</i></a>, or even the best of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3935-stars-of-the-lid/"" target=""_blank"">Stars of the Lid</a>, <i>Lobelia</i> takes ideas and sounds you know and recreates them in Jantz' image.</p>
<p>In instrumental music, the focus is so often on the playing and performances, with the laurels going to the musicians with the best chops. That has its place, of course, and it's at least part of the reason why people gravitate to music with words so consistently. It's easier to relate and hold on to a well-articulated story, sentiment, or slogan than it is a particularly perfected technique. Jantz is no slouch instrumentally-- the webs of guitar on ""Paper Delivery"" are involved and perfectly placed, while the richness and delivery of every chord during ""The River's Course"" speak to a craftsman who knows his tools. But Jantz' songs are bigger than their parts, more sophisticated than his playing suggests. When his emphasis is on imagination and feeling (and it mostly is for <i>Lobelia</i>), Jantz makes his most compelling music. ""I Forgot"", for instance, is the album's longest piece by about three minutes, but it's built almost entirely of lazy electronic hum and plucked notes that bounce around the room like the world's slowest pinballs. It's gentle and gorgeous. When Jantz mixes sounds of his newborn's laughter after nearly six minutes, it's a brilliantly sweet moment embedded in a simple piece of music-- a nice little bit of joy in a form that sometimes elects to strip the personality from its people.</p></div>"|15527.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15527-lobelia/|8.0|Grayson Currin

She's facing away from the camera.</p>
<p>Brooklyn native Gary Olson and the rotating lineup of musicians that make up the Ladybug Transistor have been courting such brushes with indie almost-fame since the mid-1990s. They came closest with 1999's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4628-the-albemarle-sound/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Albermarle Sound</i></a>, a model of psych-spangled, baroque-inclined indie pop. Bell left the band after 2003's fine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4629-ladybug-transistor/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled album</a>, which was recorded in Arizona rather than the band's usual Flatbush. And the Ladybug Transistor faced tragedy shortly before the release of 2007's disappointingly transitional <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10304-cant-wait-another-day/"" target=""_blank""><i>Can't Wait Another Day</i></a>, when they lost San Fadyl's steady drumming due to his death from an asthma attack.</p>
<p>Four years later, the Ladybug Transistor's seventh album (and sixth for Merge) brings together yet another iteration of the band's roster for a modest, pleasant indie-pop record. ""Low-stakes"" is a phrase that seems to come up a lot these days, but it's not quite right for <i>Clutching Stems</i>, a solid record that's stylistically as lush and rich as ever from this group-- this is the opposite of lo-fi, the antithesis of garage-rock. Still, as easy as it is to root for the Ladybug Transistor after all these years, and especially their more recent hardships, the songs themselves often blend together, and sometimes it can be hard to remember their particulars.</p>
<p><i>Clutching Stems</i> steps back from the country and western direction hinted at on <i>Can't Wait Another Day</i>, and there's nothing here as jarring as the now-prescient sax solo from that album's opening ""Always on the Telephone"". Instead, the Ladybug Transistor's latest stays mostly in a safe but always comfortable cocoon of what could be called ""classic indie pop"": crisp drums, intimately mic'd acoustic guitars, chiming electric guitar riffs, autumnal keyboards, regal trumpet, and the gentle interplay between Olson's practiced baritone and guest Frida Eklund's soft harmonies. It's all rendered with appealing warmth and clarity. You could trace lines back to the Smiths, the Field Mice, and the Left Banke, or forward to Belle and Sebastian, Jens Lekman, the Lucksmiths, the Clientele, and the Radio Dept.</p>
<p>Trains, Brooklyn, beaches, and crumbling relationships populate many of the lyrics, which tend to be understated and erudite, rife with slant rhymes and unexpected line breaks. ""Oh Christina"" is fairly representative: After field-recorded noises of seagulls and a subway train's arrival at Brighton Beach, a delicately picked acoustic introduction gives way to subtle, sophisticated 60s pop, weighted with music references: ""Can't you see it/ Was not me who believed that love will tear us apart."" The title track takes the Metro-North rail line one-way toward regret (""stems"" somehow rhymes with both ""friends"" and ""flames""), ""Light on the Narrow Gauge"" neatly evokes the ""dying light"" it describes, and ""Breaking Up on the Beat"" is a stately, melancholy reflection set by the oceanside. ""You know me, but not too well,"" Olson adds on another lonesome, midtempo contemplation, ""Ignore the Bell"". If only that were a little less true. <i>Clutching Stems</i> is a patient, exquisitely produced indie-pop record that never quite makes eye contact.</p></div>"|15491.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15491-clutching-stems/|6.4|Marc Hogan

I want to quit my pretty good downtown job and follow the band around Europe. I want to trade poorly recorded tapes with other superfans and scoff mightily at the non-believers. This is the type of devotion JOMF should inspire. To date, the long-running Portland collective's scabrous interpretation of Americana has been appropriately grimy and confrontational: Bandleader Tom Greenwood is the odds-on favorite to shiv a Fleet Fox. Lately, though, the band's increasingly tame albums haven't lived up to its reputation.</p>
<p><i>Earth Sound System</i> is structurally similar to recent JOMF offerings-- <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11088-valley-of-fire/"" target=""_blank"">Valley of Fire</a></i>, <i>Ballads of the Revolution</i>-- in that it features a handful of tracks split between extended improvisations and disarmingly straightforward electric balladry. JOMF have remained noisy, but tragically, they've discovered organization. The first track on <i>Earth Sound System</i>, ""In the Willows"", features Greenwood mumbling over bent chords, like a grounded, broken-winged Spiritualized. The next track, ""Raga Joining"", is a scraping jam, a drum machine bursting out of a flute in a rug warehouse.</p>
<p>The songs, especially, sound cursory. Perhaps this is due to familiarity, once-fresh ideas that now seem rote. But I don't think so. JOMF used to build tracks around ideas, around snippets of speech or old hymns: They had ties to history, a history that JOMF were either besmirching or honoring (or both) with their treatments. <i>Valley of Fire</i>, for instance, featured two long tracks, one tethered to a ramshackle funk sermon and the other a tribute-- however tenuous-- to a Public Enemy song. But Greenwood's voice, a distinctly 1990s strain of off-key alt-troubadour, offers no such tether to the past.</p>
<p>The concepts that were brilliantly muddled in Greenwood's mind-- noisenik gristle, folksong, skronky improvisation-- are now compartmentalized. The impulse is understandable: Greenwood is hardly the first artist to appropriate traditional songcraft before wanting to try his hand at it. But the songs on <i>Earth Sound System</i> lack the purpose of their inspiration. They lack even the dark hippie rhetoric the band is most capable of. When the band attempts bracing garage rock on the closing ""Where We Go"", they suck their air out of the room with their hoary posturing.</p>
<p><i>Earth Sound System</i> offers a different vision of JOMF, but a lesser one. Greenwood and co.'s impulses have grown disappointingly easy to dissect. The result is music that, by any definition, remains experimental and difficult, but the invigorating internal tension between the ordained simplicity of American musics and the free-will noise jams has evaporated. It's possible to appreciate <i>Earth Sound System</i> merely for its mossy overgrowth, but I'm not quitting my day job.</p></div>"|15509.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15509-earth-sound-system/|5.6|Andrew Gaerig

Black Lips seem to want it both ways. With the release of their fourth studio album, 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10626-good-bad-not-evil/"" target=""_blank""><i>Good Bad Not Evil</i></a>, the Atlanta rockers saw their audience expand well beyond the garage-punk underground, thanks to a new alliance with Vice that yielded fawning <a href=""http://video.nytimes.com/video/2007/03/19/arts/1194817103613/hardest-working-band-at-sxsw.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>New York Times</i> profiles</a>, Conan O'Brien appearances, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxUndFNsMdY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Virgin Mobile ad placements</a>. At the time, a Hives-sized crossover success didn't seem out of the question, but the Lips seemed to handily kibosh that possibility with 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12702-200-million-thousand/"" target=""_blank""><i>200 Million Thousand</i></a>, a sprawling mess that seemed designed to prove Black Lips could still out-scuzz and out-slop the lowest of the lo-fi.</p>
<p>The band's decision to record <i>Arabia Mountain</i> with Amy Winehouse producer Mark Ronson is surprising, not because they're at odds aesthetically-- the two camps do share an affinity for 1960s retro recording techniques-- but because of the timing: hooking up with an A-list producer is the sort of move that would've made more sense two years ago, to capitalize on <i>Good Bad Not Evil</i>'s mainstream-breaching momentum. But whether they're responding to Vice's <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/news/black-lips-add-polish-with-mark-ronson-s-1005187302.story"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vocal dissatisfaction</a> with <i>200 Million Thousand</i> or following the example of their late friend Jay Reatard-- whose 2009 swan song <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13371-watch-me-fall/"" target=""_blank""><i>Watch Me Fall</i></a> saw him cleaning up his buzzsaw-pop sound without compromising his essence-- Black Lips seem more eager to play ball this time around. And unlike previous cautionary examples of garage-rock bands teaming up with Top 40 hitmakers (the Hives and Pharrell, the Mooney Suzuki and the Matrix), Ronson thankfully doesn't try to make Black Lips into something they're not.</p>
<p>Though an early single had the loaded title ""New Direction"", <i>Arabia Mountain</i> sticks to the same <i>Nuggets</i>-style playbook that's governed all previous Black Lips releases. Ronson, who produced nine songs and mastered another two recorded with Deerhunter's Lockett Pundt, simply gives the band the most faithful faux-60s production money can buy. If anything's changed here, it's Black Lips' point of emphasis on the <i>Nuggets</i> spectrum: <i>Arabia Mountain</i> draws less from the sinister psychedelia of the 13th Floor Elevators or the deranged blues of early Beefheart, and more from the toga-party-rockin' likes of the Sonics and the Premiers. So it favors the more amiable aspects of 60s garage-- frathouse-rocking saxophones, songs inspired by comic-book superheroes and baseball mascots, and grooooovy singing saw-- over anti-authoritarian attitudes and fuzzbox abuse.</p>
<p>Black Lips have never been shy about showing off their playful side, but in the past, these moments (<i>Let It Bloom</i>'s poignant, poor-boy ballad ""Dirty Hands"", <i>Good Bad Not Evil</i>'s outsider anthem ""Bad Kids"", <i>200 Million Thousand</i>'s sober-up pledge ""Starting Over"") nicely complemented their more raucous rave-ups, revealing a sincere softer side to the band's notorious delinquent image. With <i>Arabia Mountain</i> exuding a mostly cheeky and cheerful demeanor, you do lose some of the oppositional tension between innocence and insolence that always distinguished Black Lips from the garage-punk pack. And with a somewhat bloated 16-song tracklist, the album's abundance of open-roof Thunderbird anthems-- ""Go Out and Get It"", ""Time"", ""New Direction""-- starts to feel somewhat interchangeable.</p>
<p>But <i>Arabia Mountain</i>'s chiseled production and considerably tighter songcraft provides a better forum for showcasing the band's subversive sense of humor. The best songs here play up the dichotomy between their retro sound and modern preoccupations: bad acid trips at the Louvre (the Yardbirds-ish freakbeater ""Modern Art""), exotic fad diets (the breezy Beach Boys-via-Ramones romp ""Raw Meat""), and post-recession survival tactics (the spot-on country-Stones send-up ""Dumpster Diving""). And in anticipation of those old-school fans who might view <i>Arabia Mountain</i> as a calculated act of careerism, the Lips throw a late-game curveball with the queasy closer ""You Keep on Running"", a creepy haunted-house trawl that finds Cole Alexander issuing the title's warning in a high-pitched squeal that's equally unnerving and silly. Its inclusion sends a none-too-subtle message to anyone who thinks they've got Black Lips all figured out: <i>Arabia Mountain</i> may be poised to push this band further over-ground, but they're not going up without a fight.</p></div>"|15494.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15494-arabia-mountain/|7.7|Stuart Berman

Much like the iTunes session Vampire Weekend shared just before the Christmas holiday, this Best Coast record feels like something of a victory lap at the end of a flagship year. Since the release of her L.A. outfit's debut splash, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28196-best-coast/"" target=""_blank""><i>Crazy For You</i></a>, Cosentino's profile has ballooned. For an artist on a small independent label, she sold a boatload of records. She <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/40831-watch-best-coast-joins-weezer-live/"" target=""_blank"">joined tourmates</a> Weezer on-stage. Alongside VW's Rostam Batmanglij and Kid Cudi, she lent her face and voice to a cross-pollinating Converse campaign. Her relationship with Wavves' Nathan Williams provided onlookers and press alike the opportunity to coronate them as a new, less terrifying Kurt and Courtney. She <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/tv/#/overunder/1669-best-coast-wavves/2684-fun-with-sporks/"" target=""_blank"">met and touched</a> Justin Bieber. And with the addition of near constant touring, it's not hard to understand what she means by ""life has been pretty nuts.""</p>
<p>Best Coast began as one in a long list of lo-fi, beach-oriented pop projects. Easy to file. But as heard here, Cosentino's voice has grown quite a bit since. When listened to side-by-side with a handful of her early, far grimier singles, <i>Crazy For You</i> is a comparatively bright and shiny affair. Recorded in East West Studios, the very same room that helped birth <i>Pet Sounds</i>, these sessions promise another upgrade in fidelity. Hearing a song like ""Something in the Way""-- a crud-covered 7"" cut-- really belted makes for a completely different listening experience. Sure, there's some distortion kicked up in the chord changes, but as she details in a half-hour interview included with the iTunes purchase, the stripping away of effects is still an ongoing process. She's becoming confident in her singing.</p>
<p>So ""Crazy For You"" sounds totally refreshing here, the chorus hook of ""Boyfriend"" sharper than it's ever been before and ""Goodbye"" receives a deserved upgrade as well. With the exception of ""Our Deal"", a <i>Crazy For You</i> sleeper that's been extended in service of some waterlogged atmospherics, these slightly tweaked new versions are often superior to the originals. ""When I'm With You"", arguably her sweetest slice of pop to date, is near flawless. But placing Cosentino's vocals in the limelight also comes with its share of drawbacks, namely the attention it brings to holes in her songwriting. Whatever you think of her weed- and boy-crazy sensibilities-- and plenty admire their simplicity and directness-- it's clear after listening to her give everything she's got to a cover of Loretta Lynn's ""Fist City"" that she's a far stronger singer at this point than she is a lyricist. If her songwriting has come along as much as her voice has in the past year, that won't be the case much longer.</p></div>"|15524.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15524-itunes-session/|7.5|David Bevan

Though inspired by the savage fury of Sex Pistols, the Manchester-based quartet founded by Pete Shelley and future Magazine leader Howard Devoto directed that energy toward explosively melodic songs that located their punk politics not in universal slogans or transgressive gestures but in personal anxieties. And Buzzcocks are still different today. The buzzsaw-sharp songs from the band's late-1970s peak have aged better than most, continuing to influence new generations of musicians. The group's more recent reunion albums and tours, moreover, have done nothing to diminish that formidable legacy.</p>
<p><i>A Different Compilation</i>, which brings together new studio recordings of 24 of Buzzcocks' most vital songs, can be seen generously as another example of the band's willingness to stand apart. ""The original records now sound like demos,"" Shelley explains in the press materials. ""These new versions, honed by years on the road, showcase the songs as we know they should be, the way we know audiences love to hear them."" On the other hand, there's a reason the originals have grown so beloved, and anyone unfamiliar with the band would still be better off starting with 1979 classic <i>Singles Going Steady</i>; diehard fans wanting to hear newer recordings of the old songs, meanwhile, might already be content with 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11079-30/"">30</a></i> or other Buzzcocks live albums. Plus, there's a whole mixed history of artists re-recording their hits, from the unfortunate K-Tel oldies remakes to Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's more imaginative <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/702-greatest-palace-music/"">Greatest Palace Music</a></i>. Just in 2008, also on <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/labels/468-cooking-vinyl/"">Cooking Vinyl</a>, college rockers Camper Van Beethoven had to re-record a few songs for a <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12077-popular-songs-of-great-enduring-strength-and-beauty/"">best-of compilation</a> due to label conflicts.</p>
<p>Hand-wringing aside, this is a well-chosen set of compelling songs, and if new recordings can probably never match the charm of Buzzcocks' originals, there's still a certain modest appeal to hearing one of punk's most celebrated catalogs given a brawny, contemporary treatment. Where <i>Singles</i> sets out iconic singles like ""Orgasm Addict"" and ""Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)"" next to their B-sides, <i>A Different Compilation</i> also delves into Buzzcocks' often-underrated album tracks, from Ralph Nader-nodding <i>Another Music in a Different Kitchen</i> opener ""Fast Cars"" (here shorn of its introduction quoting the 1977 <i>Spiral Scratch</i> EP's ""Boredom"", ostensibly because that track now precedes it) to guitarist Steve Diggle's <i>Dookie</i>-predicting ""When Love Turns Around"", originally from 1993's <i>Trade Test Transmissions</i>.</p>
<p>Then again, though these hard-hitting versions of such memorable punk-era nuggets as ""Harmony in My Head"" and ""Why Can't I Touch It?"" start from only the strongest source material, <i>A Different Compilation</i> lacks the adventurous spirit that helped make the band so worth compiling in the first place. Buzzcocks are often credited with inventing punk-pop, but that genre's modern-day conventions weren't so solidified then-- think of the difference between <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/features/resonant-frequency/7954-resonant-frequency-78/"">early disco records</a> and the disco of Village People and <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>-- and there's little here musically you might not hear from some of the band's lesser descendants. And, too, it's not exactly as if there's a huge audience clamoring for re-recordings of late-70s and early-80s Martin Hannett productions (Joy Division, New Order), which is what we're given here in the form of ""Boredom"", fellow <i>Spiral Scratch</i> track ""Breakdown"", and Diggle-fronted former B-side ""Why She's a Girl From the Chainstore"".</p>
<p>So while <i>A Different Compilation</i> definitely isn't a starting point for newcomers to Buzzcocks, it's nothing more or less than a novel document from one of punk's defining bands-- and one of the few from punk's first wave that's still a going concern, at that. ""When people put punk rock records on in 1976, 77, they had to rethink their whole lives,"" Diggle told Pitchfork's Patrick Sisson in a <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/features/interviews/7583-buzzcocks/"">January 2009 interview</a>. ""It changed your consciousness, the way you looked at the world, just like powerful records should."" This latest compilation probably won't do that, but it might help point you back to the records that did-- and could again.</p></div>"|15516.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15516-a-different-compilation/|6.5|Marc Hogan

Tongue-in-cheek and perhaps a little too 2008, that blurb suggests the perspective of a guy who considers himself an outsider: a Lawrence, Kansas, native who's so far removed from any popular scene, whether it's Brooklyn or San Francisco or Montreal, that he can only look on with chagrin and perhaps a bit of scorn. <i>Lonely Twin</i>, Geiger's second album as Hospital Ships, seems preoccupied with centers and margins, inclusions and exclusions: ""Open up the door and let me in,"" he sings at the beginning of opener ""Love or Death"". ""Open up the door, time's getting thin.""</p>
<p>Geiger is not really an outsider, though, at least not in the way that, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5849-jandek/"" target=""_blank"">Jandek</a> is an outsider. Lawrence has always had a pretty good scene, and before launching Hospital Ships, Geiger did time in Shearwater, the Appleseed Cast, and the Minus Story. Members of those groups comprise his backing band on <i>Lonely Twin</i>, a big step from his 2008 LP, <i>Oh Ramona</i>, which was essentially Geiger solo. A multi-instrumentalist who favors keyboard and embellishments, he pulls out all the stops on these new songs, arranging and sometimes over-arranging them for maximum impact. The album is bursting with ideas, most of which work pretty well. On ""Little Dead Leaf"", he slams the drums up against the accordion in a skewed near-waltz, as though determined to keep the song afloat for a few more measures. The keyboards, however, sound like they're emanating from a ship that's just sunk beneath the waves, suggesting a sense of seasick unease.</p>
<p>Because Geiger hails form the Midwest and sings in a high, androgynous voice that recalls late-90s indie rock, Hospital Ships bear repeated comparisons to the Flaming Lips (who <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SZxibmeGmo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">inspired Geiger's stage name</a>). Unlike that band, however, he doesn't excel as a maximalist, as the bombastic ""Reprise"" proves. Repeating its refrain to the point of tedium, the song strains for impact but never quite achieves it. Perhaps a more apt comparison is to the Woodstock Americana of Mercury Rev, who likewise specialize in immersive arrangements and nuanced falsetto. Geiger's songs are densely arranged, yet strikingly, almost uncomfortably intimate, especially the disquieting hush of ""Phantom Limb"" and the fatalistic march of ""Carry On"" before it erupts into a Biblical din. There's a dark undercurrent of dispossession coursing through these songs, which sound measured and conflicted even as they grasp for meaning and import. That generosity of spirit suggests Geiger knows that everyone, even Canadian collectives and celebrity kids, is an outsider looking in.</p></div>"|15517.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15517-lonely-twin/|7.0|Stephen M.

Primarily written and performed by singer-songwriters Margaret Morgan and Patrick Cockett, the album has long circulated among fans of obscure psych-folk, and it has been reissued several times in perhaps-not-entirely-legit versions. The album's reputation is well-earned, as <i>These Trails</i> is a lovely and incredibly evocative slice of Pacific folk-rock, and Drag City has performed a good service by finally reissuing the album in a handsome new authorized edition.</p>
<p>The musicians behind the creation of <i>These Trails</i> were never even officially a band-- they played no professional gigs together and made no other recordings. (Which is why there are no outtakes or bonus materials included with this reissue.) Margaret Morgan and Patrick Cockett lived together in Hawaii in what sound like idyllic circumstances, writing and playing songs based largely on the majesty of their natural surroundings.  The duo was joined in the studio by singer-guitarist Carlos Pardeiro and Dave Choy, a studio engineer who embellished the group's acoustic material with what was then a state-of-the-art Arp synthesizer. The addition of these vintage electronics helps to give the album a slightly off-kilter wobble, creating an otherworldly atmosphere that would echo decades later in the work of Stereolab and Broadcast.</p>
<p>For the most part, however, the music on <i>These Trails</i> sounds as though it could have been created only in its own specific time and place. Like many of the best psych-folk documents of the era, the album seems to have been produced in a completely irony-free environment, and it has a sense of guilelessness that would be virtually impossible to reproduce today. Morgan sings in a voice highly reminiscent of Joni Mitchell, but with a distinctive island lilt of her own. Throughout the album she harmonizes with Cockett in a manner that sounds both unique and effortless, backed chiefly by acoustic guitars, dulcimer, and Choy's mysterious burbling Arp.</p>
<p>Lyrically the album abounds with references to local Hawaiian landmarks, flora, and vocabulary.  Songs such as ""Our House in Hanalei"" or ""Waipoo"" can serve as a sort of personal guidebook, with Morgan and Cockett pointing out various natural features along the trail. (""Banana leaves describe the breezes... gingers grow, where white buds lay sleeping."") Especially evocative is ""Rusty's House"", which describes a visit to the front porch of surfer Rusty Miller, whose remote home was accessible only by foot, in an account so vivid that the listener can practically feel the sunshine and taste the pot smoke.</p>
<p>Even more transporting are the album's instrumental interludes ""Psyche I"" and ""Psyche II"", on which Choy gently explores the Arp's cosmic possibilities. These mildly trippy moments aside, most of the action on <i>These Trails</i> remains firmly affixed in the verdant Hawaiian soil. The songs are short and melodic, and the musicians avoid many of the indulgences that mar so many psychedelic albums of the time period-- there are thankfully no prolonged organ solos or overt references to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>.</p>
<p>Patrick Cockett has gone on to perform with such artists as Buffy Sainte-Marie and Taj Mahal, but by all evidence the enigmatic Margaret Morgan, who passed away in 2004, never recorded again.  This fact makes <i>These Trails</i> seem all the more like a snapshot from an exquisite but fleeting moment in time. And though it is interesting to speculate where their music might have gone from here if the artists had continued to write and record together, there is no denying that they captured something special on <i>These Trails</i>, and while the album plays that seems like enough.</p></div>"|15508.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15508-these-trails/|8.1|Matthew Murphy

It's a familiar storyline these days, but when Arctic Monkeys' precociously jaded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/497-whatever-people-say-i-am-thats-what-im-not/"" target=""_blank""><i>Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</i></a> became the fastest-selling UK debut ever, back in early 2006, the idea of a ""MySpace band"" was still something new. Now, with News Corp. reportedly trying to sell MySpace and other sites such as Bandcamp and Tumblr taking the struggling social network's place in music think-pieces, the Sheffield band's latest is a throwback in a more classic sense.</p>
<p><i>Suck It and See</i>, the Arctics' fourth and most rewarding album so far, is not music to blog to. Listen while updating your Facebook status or crafting the perfect tweet, and you're probably going to miss something crucial. Actually, you're probably going to miss something anyway: For instance, the title, while no doubt partly intended as a provocation toward American audiences, is mostly just easily misunderstood Brit-speak for <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/arts/music/alex-turner-on-arctic-monkeys-suck-it-and-see.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""give it a try.""</a> But the record itself brims with endlessly replayable details, some goofy and some poignant, both in frontman Alex Turner's always keenly observed lyrics and in the band's ever-proficient music, the latter of which ranges here from muscular glam-rock to chiming indie pop balladry. Cowboy movies and humdrum observations about the weather conceal thoughtful contemplations on romance and coming of age.</p>
<p>""Oh, in five years' time, will it be, 'Who the fuck's Arctic Monkeys?'"" That was Turner five years ago. Fittingly, <i>Suck It and See</i> is something of a reboot for the band. 2007 sophomore effort <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10150-favourite-worst-nightmare/"" target=""_blank""><i>Favourite Worst Nightmare</i></a>, the Arctics' first album with Simian Mobile Disco's James Ford producing, found the group enriching its palette both emotionally and sonically, while musically toughening up. 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13374-humbug/"" target=""_blank""><i>Humbug</i></a> paired the group with Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme, leading to predictably brawny, unwound results. Elsewhere, Turner's once-shouty voice ripened into a honeyed croon with 2008 side project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5741-the-last-shadow-puppets/"" target=""_blank"">the Last Shadow Puppets</a>, and his recent solo soundtrack for Richard Ayoade film <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15224-submarine-ost/"" target=""_blank""><i>Submarin</i>e</a> allowed him to unplug. The new record, produced by Ford but with a burly backing vocal from Homme on the churning ""All My Own Stunts"", sounds informed by each of these experiences, distilling them all into the unit's next phase: confident, melodic, and as expertly played as ever.</p>
<p>Turner has been talking up country greats Johnny Cash, George Jones, and Patsy Cline as lyrical influences on this album, along with Nick Cave, the Byrds, Nick Lowe, David Bowie, and Leonard Cohen. When he's at his clearest (which is still pretty heavy with ambiguities), <i>Suck It and See</i> has a bleak sense of humor to prove he's not kidding. That's fleshed out by bandmates whose tastes run more toward Black Sabbath stomp or Stooges aggression. Musically, drummer Matt Helders remains the Arctics' not-so-secret weapon, capable of lizard-brain freakouts or deceptively innocent waltzes; Sean Combs has invited him <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/arctic-monkeys/51467"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">more</a> <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/diddy---dirty-money/53196"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">than</a> <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/arctic-monkeys/50005"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">once</a> to sit in with Diddy Dirty Money.</p>
<p>So hardly a verse goes by without an instant quotable or two, and the backing is elegant enough that at first you might not even notice. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42215-watch-the-new-arctic-monkeys-video/"">""Don't Sit Down 'Cause I've Moved Your Chair""</a>, a swaggering boogie worthy of its title, lists off dangerous ideas that are all presumably less dangerous than sitting down (""Do the Macarena in the devil's lair""-- you know, the usual). Plucky ode ""Reckless Serenade"" has a hell of an opening line: ""Topless models doing semaphor/ Wave their flags as she walks by and get ignored."" Other times, Turner keeps his cards so close to the chest that trying to puzzle out literal meanings would probably be impossible, though his disconnected imagery is usually still pretty compelling. These songs tend to be heavier, more fuzzed-out: <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i> nod ""Black Treacle"", which envisions ""belly-button piercings in the sky at night"" (how careful are Turner's word choices? This careful: ""Now it's getting dark, and the sky looks sticky/ More like black treacle than tar""); ""The Hellcat Spangled Shalalala"", which juxtaposes memorably impressionistic verses with searing, yes, sha-la-la-la choruses; ""She's Thunderstorms"", as tempestuous and captivating as its female subject. Only jagged, mathy ""Library Pictures"" fails to hold interest.</p>
<p>For a band whose breakthrough hit was called <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGCre4HgPLU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor""</a>, Arctic Monkeys have always been perhaps unexpectedly great at gentler moments. On that score, <i>Suck It and See</i> is a thing to behold. The heart-wrenching ""Love Is a Laserquest"" addresses a lost love every bit as unsparingly as past Arctics slow burners ""Do Me a Favour"", ""Cornerstone"", or ""A Certain Romance"", picking up a lyrical theme that also runs throughout an album by a very different band, Fleet Foxes' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15363-helplessness-blues/"" target=""_blank""><i>Helplessness Blues</i></a>: ""Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now?"" Finale ""That's Where You're Wrong"", in the steadily escalating two-chord format of LCD Soundsystem's ""All My Friends"", furthers this concern with the passing years: ""Don't take it so personally, honey/ You're not the only one that time has got it in for."" Now there's something you don't see every blog-second: a group that grew up too fast, aging gracefully.</p></div>"|15450.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15450-suck-it-and-see/|7.5|Marc Hogan

Not only did country music graduate from a rather large niche market to the mainstream, but the talent on the city's periphery began to insinuate itself into the center, as songwriters like Guy Clark, Kris Kristofferson, Donnie Fritts, and Willie Nelson attracted so much attention that the scene became known as the ""New Nashville."" In practice, this group of musicians raised hell all over town and wrote aching songs with unpretentiously poetic lyrics, passing their compositions up the ranks for royalties and notoriety. A few became stars in their own right: Nelson's <i>Red Headed Stranger</i> was a critical and commercial hit, and Kristofferson became the scene's sex symbol. But some of the most talented songwriters simply faded into the background, with albums that were invariably praised by critics but largely ignored by listeners. Despite a robust voice and a thoughtful way with medleys, Larry Jon Wilson retreated to Augusta, Georgia, but managed a comeback just prior to his death last year. Mickey Newbury, disgusted with industry politics in Nashville, absconded to the mountains of Oregon, releasing albums on his own label until his death in 2002 (his final record, <i>A Long Road Home</i>, was recorded between oxygen treatments for emphysema).</p>
<p>Some of the scene's success can be attributed to Newbury, a Houston native who wrote hits for Tom Jones, Don Gibson, and Kenny Rogers (if you've heard ""Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)"", then you've heard Newbury). He also hung around with and influenced a younger generation of local songwriters, many of them similarly Lone Star expats; you can hear him in Kristofferson's sing/speak phrasing and in Nelson's complex narrative undertakings. Even today, he remains a songwriter's songwriter, lionized by a new generation of musicians including Will Oldham, Nick Cave, and the Black Swans' Jerry DeCicca (who says he got the job producing Wilson's 2009 comeback album based on his thorough knowledge of Newbury's catalog).</p>
<p>Drag City's new bundle of reissues-- which includes three albums plus a set of rarities from the late 1960s and early 70s, released separately on vinyl and together in a 4xCD set titled <i>An American Trilogy</i>-- portrays Newbury as a man out of time and out of place, even among his friends in the New Nashville scene. With his gently grainy voice and folksy phrasing, he was country more by proximity than by sound, and he incorporated jazz, R&amp;B, and folk elements into his forward-thinking music. These three LPs are all heady concept albums of a sort, sequenced to create and sustain a particular mood of grievous loss and precarious composure. Newbury conceived them specifically as a trilogy examining his own romantic past as well as the country's contentious history, and 40 years later, they sound just as imaginative, evocative, and emotional as ever.</p>
<p><i>Looks Like Rain</i>, from 1969, was actually Newbury's second album. Just a few years prior, RCA had paired him with a producer who lent his songs a too-slick sheen that Newbury detested. When he re-recorded them, he kept closer control on the music, casting the songs as spare, lonely ruminations on lost love and lost opportunities and barely masking his own depression. But there's always dignity in his despondency, and there's always something rumbling in the background of these albums: the crisp guitar and ghostly doo-wop vocals on ""33rd of August/When the Baby in My Lady Gets the Blues"", the otherworldly choir on ""San Francisco Mable Joy"", the mournful harmonica on ""Looks Like Baby's Gone"". There's real space on these albums, which are so lonesome and introverted that Newbury's flourishes of sound are less an accompaniment to his vocals than his fond memory of music half-remembered.</p>
<p><i>Looks Like Rain</i> is, quite literally, rainy-day music. The songs are interspersed with samples of a downpour, which reinforces the sense of back-porch reverie. It ought to be corny as hell, a tired gimmick meant to literalize certain aspects of the songwriting. The effect, however, not only allows the album to cohere into a listen-in-one-sitting experience, but reinforces the emotional alienation of these songs. Newbury liked the idea so much that he repeated it on subsequent albums-- a musical element as distinctive as an artist's signature on a canvas. Those interludes and other musical flourishes stitch these albums together as a whole effort, not inseparable but certainly more powerful in each other's proximity.</p>
<p>Another of Newbury's signatures was his fascination with old American songs. Arguably his biggest hit was ""An American Trilogy"", a medley from 1971's <i>'Frisco Mabel Joy</i> that interlaced ""Dixie"", ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"", and ""All My Trials"". It was at that time a contentious piece of music: At the tail end of the civil rights movement, there were calls to ban ""Dixie"" for its slavery connotations and sympathies, although Elvis Presley's over-the-top Vegas cover helped dispel some of that controversy. Newbury's arrangement is conceptually fascinating, as it pairs a southern song written by a northerner with a slave spiritual imported from the Caribbean. Musically, however, it sounds overly serious and antiquated, almost quaint-- more an artifact from the period than a durable piece of music.</p>
<p>And yet, ""An American Trilogy"" reveals Newbury's complex approach to songwriting and album sequencing: Every word or line or stanza or song complements the others and shades their meanings, contributing crucially to the whole. On all of these albums, his songs shift and melt into other songs, creating thoughtful medleys and often devastating juxtapositions-- such as the one-two punch of ""How Many Times (Must the Piper Be Paid For His Song?)"" and the gorgeous synth theme of ""Interlude"". That means songs like the relatively spry ""T. Total Tommy"" on <i>Looks Like Rain</i> and ""Why You Been Gone So Long"" on 1973's <i>Heaven Help the Child </i>stand out all the more strongly for being so self-contained. On the other hand, it means <i>Better Days</i>, a disc of demos, live recordings, and rarities, sounds particularly jarring in this set for not cohering into a more powerful whole. The songs themselves are strong, in particular a version of ""Why You Been Gone So Long"" that rivals Johnny Darrell's hit version, but they work primarily as songs, not as pieces of a larger whole.</p>
<p>When he was living in Nashville and even after he headed as far west as he could go, Newbury strove to capture something larger and more powerful than a song or even an album. This handsome set doesn't suggest exactly what he was trying to find, only that he never found it. That fate adds another layer of melancholy to these monumentally sad songs, but leavens any sense of depressiveness by showing us Newbury's obvious creative zeal. It's that sense of discovery, coupled with his unflagging belief in the purity of a well-crafted song, that makes these albums resonate as powerfully today as they ever did.</p></div>"|15473.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15473-an-american-trilogy/|8.6|Stephen M.

It may be the Rosebuds' first release since the divorce of founding members Kelly Crisp and Ivan Howard, but it's not your typical aggregation of romantic grievances set to minor keys. In fact, they avoid blame and accusation altogether in favor of a more generous and balanced accounting of loss and renewal. After all, the duo decided to continue its musical partnership, which entailed figuring out how they could work together solely as bandmates. <i>Loud Planes </i>documents not the dissolution but the redefinition of their relationship; it's a staying-together album, which not only makes it much more interesting but provides a persuasive argument for their musical compatibility.</p>
<p>The two have always made their relationship part of the band's story: Crisp and Howard formed the Rosebuds the week they got married in 2001, adopted stage/married names Kelly and Ivan Rosebud, and titled their debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6889-make-out/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Rosebuds Make Out</i></a>. Even in post-split, the band is still bound up in its dynamic, as they try to find new ways to dramatize their relationship musically. <i>Loud Planes </i>alternates their vocals in a he said/she said sequencing, as if pleading their cases to each other and to the listener; no matter who takes the lead, the other sings in the background, as if nodding in sympathy or understanding. ""I want to feel something way out here,"" Crisp sings on ""Come Visit Me"", which has the low-key vibe of a 2 a.m. phone call. ""I need something to happen now, even if it fucks me up."" She trails off on that last phrase, as if reluctant to consider the consequences, but the sharp edge of desperation in her voice makes it one of her most urgent performances to date. Howard describes his own efforts at reconciliation on ""Waiting For You"": ""I tried to make a start, and I tried to come around."" He doesn't need to tell you he wasn't exactly successful.</p>
<p><i>Loud Planes Fly Low</i> is an album about change-- not necessarily good or bad, just necessary and inevitable and immense. Especially coming after 2009's lively <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12298-life-like/"" target=""_blank""><i>Life Like</i></a>, which was based on demos they recorded for their own amusement, these new songs sound purposefully gray and somber, with cautious tempos and subdued melodies. The atmosphere is thoroughly melancholy, which is understandable, but at times the album sounds acutely oppressive-- like trying to breathe on another planet. Even on closer ""Worthwhile"", there's no release, no conclusion or epiphany to throw everything into sharp relief. Perhaps that's the nature of Crisp and Howard's partnership now: never quite settled, never quite comfortable. But for the listener, <i>Loud Planes</i> may sound oddly open-ended-- a transition album in every sense.</p></div>"|15505.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15505-loud-planes-fly-low/|7.3|Stephen M.

The Montreal producer cut his teeth on drum and bass in the late 1990s, proving time and again he was one of the genre's most creative practitioners. Meanwhile, for the past two or three years, labels like Med School, Critical, and NonPlus+ have helped free drum and bass from a creative stasis. Tobin, though, has never really been one for movements, or revivals of movements. His career interests span tasteful breakbeat jazz, aggressive storms of percussion, and moody video game soundtracks. Until 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9945-the-foley-room/"" target=""_blank"">Foley Room</a></i>, every direction had been underpinned by the orchestral and jazz samples Tobin favored working with.</p>
<p><i>ISAM</i>, the densest, most fractal album of Tobin's career, again abandons sampling in favor of digitally altered samples of Tobin's own. It is a collaboration with London-based visual artist <a href=""http://www.tessafarmer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tessa Farmer</a>, whose work is heavy on scary looking bug-warrior skeletons. Tobin sings for the first time, though his vocals are ""gender modified,"" sometimes sounding like a woman, but more often like a cipher for his machines. This level of obfuscation contrasts the familiar, jazzy samples that marked his work for so long. Even when Tobin's tracks were hustling along at 180 bpm, his considered sampling afforded them a structural grace.</p>
<p>In abandoning his long-held methods for concepts-- both musical and extra-musical-- Tobin's work has come untethered. <i>ISAM</i> cuts closer to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"" target=""_blank"">Autechre</a>'s entropic electro than anything in Tobin's catalog. At times, during the opening moments of ""Mass &amp; Spring"" and ""Night Swim"" for instance, Tobin approaches psych-y drone music. ""Goto 10"" is a mechanistic lullaby, while ""Journeyman"" indulges in a slow-leak bass fantasy. These are deconstructions all. Nowhere on <i>ISAM</i> does the beat congeal around a head-nodding tempo, nor can Tobin's melodies stroll for long before finding a cliff's edge. It's hard to imagine <i>ISAM</i> accompanying another artist's work: It is by no means gallery-pleasing mood music, and its constant stops and starts are immensely distracting.</p>
<p>Tobin used to be a dependable, dedicated craftsman, but he's intent on transitioning to full-on sonic artist. He has the ideas: <i>ISAM</i>'s pieces keep wandering into unmarked industrial zones, evoking broken things and blight. But this is heavy, foreboding music; Tobin hasn't yet learned how to balance his robust sound-art impulses with footholds for his listeners.

Most of <i>Canta Lechuza</i> (which translates as ""Owl Singing""), the second full-length offering from the Helado Negro moniker, feels like something of a one-man vacation. The compositions conjure images of lantern-lit patio parties and lightly narcotized comet-gazing, with less focus on the folkier aspects that shaped his debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13292-awe-owe/"" target=""_blank""><i>Awe Owe</i></a>.</p>
<p>From the outside looking in, <i>Canta Lechuza</i> shares something with Destroyer's latest LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1068-destroyer/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kaputt</i></a>. Like the latter record, <i>Canta Lechuza</i> finds an artist ignoring his established pastoral leanings while sailing into smoother waters in a style that touches on kitsch. But instead of Bejar's ornate, romantic bluster, Lange is more interested in negative space, noise, and subtlety-- starry-eyed crooning, celestial background textures, and slinky rhythms crafted around bass plinks and plunks that seem to have been stolen from some Barcelona nightclub and slowed to a crawl.</p>
<p>But back to all that noise. Lange is clearly in the mood to experiment, letting more traditional instruments take a backseat while he fiddles with electronic equipment, peppering nearly every track with whirs, burrs, clicks, and clacks. He occasionally takes time to build distinct grooves from all these little pieces (""Cenar en La Manana""), but more often than not, his fiddling is distracting. It's such a pleasure getting wrapped up in the dreamy ethers of a song like ""Lechuguilla"", you can't help but feel a bit slighted by the fact that Lange didn't choose to dial it back a bit.</p>
<p>Not all of the experimentation is quite so invasive. This is, after all, a record that was composed in the wilds, and Lange's ability to channel his surroundings affords <i>Canta Lechuza</i> an important transportive quality. ""El Oeste"" concludes with a serrated swell that recalls a summer thunderstorm, while ""Calculas"" features lightning bug synth flashes. Best of all are the heavily processed blurts on ""Oreja De Arena"", which provide Lange with what sounds like a belching bullfrog as a backup singer. When Lange goes with the flow and allows elements like this to permeate his music, <i>Canta Lechuza</i> is at its best.</p></div>"|15489.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15489-canta-lechuza/|6.9|Zach Kelly

For the last few years, they've been releasing singles as part of a series <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/39132-fucked-up-public-enemy-singles-more/"" target=""_blank"">based on the Chinese Zodiac</a>, each of which usually runs over the 10-minute mark. For a 2007 charity Christmas single, they managed to get James Murphy, Nelly Furtado, and ""Degrassi: the Next Generation""/""90210"" actress Shenae Grimes (among many, many others) to appear on the same song; during a 12-hour (!) NYC concert in 2008, they got moshers to smash along to Vampire Weekend's Ezra Koenig doing Descendents covers. Their reach continues unabated on their new album, <i>David Comes to Life</i>, a 78-minute rock opera.</p>
<p>The story of <i>David Comes to Life</i> is fairly complicated and, at points, heavily meta. It concerns a factory worker named David Eliade who falls in love with a woman named Veronica Boisson. They conspire to build a bomb together and death, destruction, and redemption follow; along the way, the story's narrator does battle with David for control of the plot. There's a long tradition of rock concept albums that aren't easy to understand, and this one is no exception; but enjoying it doesn't depend on decoding the tale. The record is divided into four separate acts, with a narrative focus that shifts from scene to scene-- a few songs are told from the overarching narrator's perspective, while David's ex-girlfriend, Vivian Benson, offers her side of the story in the album's back half. While a few guest vocalists are employed to help out-- Cults' Madeline Follin and singer/songwriter Jennifer Castle represent Veronica and Vivian, respectively-- the story is largely told by the band's screaming frontman, Damien Abraham, aka Pink Eyes. Taking into account the album's relatively limited range-- almost an hour and a half of straight-up bashing and riffage, with moments like the jangly acoustic figure that opens ""A Slanted Tone"" as a rare respite-- it becomes apparent that you will need a few listens and a lyric sheet to apprehend <i>David Comes to Life</i>'s ambition and follow its labyrinthine storyline.</p>
<p>Or, you could just sit back and let the record's dense, visceral blast of guitar squall wash over you. More than any single Fucked Up record, <i>David Comes to Life</i> is thick with walls of noisy melody. It's hard to get a handle on just how many guitar tracks are on a given song, and Shane Stoneback deserves a medal for mixing the sheer bulk of the sound into something so clear. But for all the shoegazey textures and blistering sonic assault, <i>David Comes to Life</i> is also direct and immediate. Hooks are piled on top of hooks, bursting through torrents of spacey noise (""I Was There"") and peppy rhythms (""The Recursive Girl"") alike. At points, the primal appeal of the blunt and effective riffing even brings to mind the bar-band rock of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2010-the-hold-steady/"" target=""_blank"">the Hold Steady</a>.</p>
<p>Out front, Abraham still retains his scorched-earth bark. He's been finding ways to broaden his voice's impact, and it's never sounded better than it does here. Abraham knows his range and limitations and is finding new ways to work within them while adjusting to the band's forward lurch, in effect becoming another instrument in the mix. His stomping melancholia on ""Turn the Season"" feels like a gut-check, while he follows up his sole quiet moment on album closer ""Lights Go Up"" by shouting amidst curled screams, ""I'm still in love with you/ After all of this time!"" Besides the aforementioned appearances by Follin and Castle, Kurt Vile delivers a typically slack backing vocal on ""Lights Go Up"", too-- but, really, this is The Pink Eyes Show, and it's never been so compelling to watch.</p>
<p>That said, all the howling and the album's extreme length might be a tough thing for those new to Fucked Up. For people in this category, it might be best to check out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9982-hidden-world/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hidden World</i></a> first; it's a good representation of how fun and hooky Fucked Up are when they're in the zone, and in many ways it's a simpler, spiritual precursor to this record. Regardless, <i>David Comes to Life</i> is absolutely worth the commitment, a convincing demonstration of what can happen when a band works without limitations.</p></div>"|15513.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15513-david-comes-to-life/|8.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

It's the opening noise of Depeche Mode's 1984 single ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzGnX-MbYE4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">People Are People</a>"", or something a lot like it, and it's a reminder that the band used to be about <i>sound</i> as much as mood and tune and personality.</p>
<p>The first decade's worth of Depeche Mode songs were eminently remixable, because they almost all had sonic signatures: You could put together a terrific version of anything on, say, <i>Some Great Reward</i> without even using their melodies or vocals. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1xrNaTO1bI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Personal Jesus</a>"", from 1989, got over on its glam beat and a sneering electric guitar that the band treated like the coolest new gizmo they'd ever encountered. But for the past 20 years-- and especially since Alan Wilder left in 1995-- their arrangements sound more like the work of a generic band-that-uses-electronics, and most of the remixers here don't replace them with anything particularly distinctive either.</p>
<p>As its title suggests, the 3xCD <i>Remixes 2</i>-- also available in a condensed single-disc edition-- is a sequel to another brick of a set, 2004's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2284-remixes-81-04/"" target=""_blank""><i>Remixes 81-04</i></a>. That collection consisted mostly of fondly remembered mixes that had appeared on Depeche Mode's 12"" singles over the years, with a few newly commissioned reworkings of old favorites. Since then, they've released two awful-ish studio albums, whose single remixes are drawn on heavily here, along with a bit of barrel-scraping for passable older stuff, like Gareth Jones' 1985 remix of ""Fly on the Windscreen"", and another smattering of new interpretations. There are some big names here: UNKLE, M83, Trentemøller, Dan the Automator (who sadly doesn't take on ""John the Revelator""). Few of them are doing anywhere near their best work, because they generally don't have much to work with.</p>
<p>There's some good stuff here anyway, probably a really solid EP's worth. Röyksopp's ""<a href=""http://downloads.pitchforkmedia.com/Depeche%20Mode%20-%20%20Puppets%20(Royksopp%20Remix).mp3"" target=""_blank"">Puppets</a>"" reaches all the way back to a 1981 album track-- it's effectively a half-rewritten cover of the song rather than a remix proper, but they sound like they're having a blast. It's fun to hear the two ex-members of Depeche Mode each remixing a song written after his departure-- Vince Clarke does ""Behind the Wheel"" and Alan Wilder does another version of ""In Chains"". Digitalism's take on ""Never Let Me Down Again"" takes advantage of its one-note melody to build up a head of scalding digital distortion. And of the three mixes of ""Personal Jesus"" here, one is pretty good. (That would be the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-kr4iBW3hw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one by Stargate</a>, who are big enough Depeche Mode fans that they snuck a musical quote from ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsvfofcIE1Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Master and Servant</a>"" into Rihanna's ""S&amp;M"". Their version is also one of only three tracks on these three discs to come in under the four-minute mark.) Mostly, though, this is a depressing reminder of the distance between what Depeche Mode once were and what they've become.</p></div>"|15511.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15511-remixes-2-81-11/|4.3|Douglas Wolk

He wasn't necessarily part of that scene, but he benefited from having a fashionable context, and so his debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8540-we-have-sound/"" target=""_blank""><i>We Have Sound</i></a>, was a modest success. After that record, Vek essentially disappeared from the pop landscape as he went about setting up his own studio and gradually piecing together his second album, <i>Leisure Seizure</i>.</p>
<p>Waiting six years to follow up a debut record is not usually a good move, but it has worked out well for Vek. Since indie music fashions have moved on since 2005, he no longer comes across as being part of a larger trend, and his idiosyncrasies are more apparent. He's dropped a lot of the post-punk tics of his debut, but his emphasis on rhythm remains, with nearly every track built around a crisp, precise beat. His compositions are neat and tidy; he cycles through textures and sounds but avoids clutter and unnecessary doubling of parts. There's a ruthless efficiency to his music that can be very attractive, but even at his best, Vek sounds like a producer just on the verge of finding his own distinct style.</p>
<p>Vek's voice, often flat and heavily accented, is alternately one of the most appealing and most off-putting elements on <i>Leisure Seizure</i>. He's very good at affecting a petty, bratty tone, and this suits the bitter, confrontational character of album highlights ""A Chore"" and ""Aroused"". Vek has a limited vocal range, but it's obvious that he's put a lot of thought into how to play to his strengths and switch up his technique. At some points he exaggerates his flatness for effect-- for one particularly successful example, he drags out his syllables over the swinging beat of ""We Do Nothing"" to convey a sense of boredom. He's most compelling when he employs a sinister singsong on ""A Chore"" and the semi-rapped ""World of Doubt"", casting himself as something of an antagonistic presence.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Vek's voice outstays its welcome by the middle of the album. <i>Leisure Seizure</i> is front-loaded with its best material, such that the second half of the record becomes rather tedious. ""Close Mic'ed"", a slow-moving ballad, is an admirable experiment in pushing for greater range, but his voice just isn't fully suited to the material and ends up spoiling the track's subtle dynamics. Other cuts on the second side, such as ""You Need to Work Your Heart Out"" and ""On a Plate"", just feel overworked and uninspired. There's a spark missing on these numbers, and the most exciting elements of Vek's style become grating as a result. It doesn't spoil the high points on the album, but it does make us yearn for a more consistent and fully realized Vek record. Hopefully we won't have to wait until 2017 for that.</p></div>"|15510.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15510-leisure-seizure/|6.2|Matthew Perpetua

It wanders through a variety of dance sub-genres (admittedly all variations of house and techno) with that air of assumed ownership that used to be the hallmark of big statement dance music albums in the late 1990s. It wasn't ever thus: the Dutch producer's 2009 debut, <i>Voyage Direct</i>, was a rigorously focused throwback to lo-fi second wave Chicago house disco loops, as tunnel-visioned as any purist could hope for. Whether intentional or not, <i>Iris</i> feels like a stab at main stage crossover by comparison, a short-circuit bid for the kind of statesmanship long enjoyed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/851-carl-craig/"" target=""_blank"">Carl Craig</a>.</p>
<p><i>Iris</i> even sounds like the kind of album Carl Craig might make if he got down with vocal house more intently. It cycles between dreamy, spacey, exquisitely produced mood pieces and surprisingly upfront but still painstakingly airbrushed vocal house (this time splitting the difference between first wave Chicago and brassy New York divatude), all wrapped up in a sensibility of rhythmic looseness swiped from 80s R&amp;B. The rhythms are the album's key drawing card, fluttering and flexing with delectable voluptuousness-- a surprise given the uncompromising straightness of <i>Voyage Direct</i>. Trago also has a light touch with gently murmuring basslines and sweeping synth chords, wrapping them around his rhythms like so many layers of fairy floss. In fact it's difficult to think of a recent dance album so unabashedly pretty at all times, deploying its top-shelf production nous to caress, rather than impress, its audience. The gorgeous, delicate Metro Area shimmy of ""Being With You"" is a particular delight.</p>
<p>All of which should make <i>Iris</i> pretty compelling indeed, and I've puzzled long and hard over why it's, somehow, not. The short answer is that the vocal tunes that ought to provide the album's highlights are almost uniformly underwhelming, capturing everything but the bittersweet euphoria that is vocal house's most noble contribution to culture. On moments like the stagey soul of ""Suckers For Fools"" (whose repetition of its title could move less patient listeners to acts of self-harm) or the classicist diva workout of ""Gave Me the Love"", Trago is nothing if not scrupulous, pulling out every possible production trick and arranging with infinite care and attention to detail the succession of melodic and sonic motifs that confirm he has studied the masters. But the key to crafting truly transcendent dancefloor anthems is to conceal within them an indefinable intensity--  physical, emotional, or preferably both-- that can't be reduced to their sonic signifiers. Trago comes close to this only once, on the aching and undulating synth-disco strut of closer ""Corrupt"".</p>
<p>It's not that Trago can't do intensity. Although I'm not sure that it was the superior album, at its best <i>Voyage Direct</i> certainly generated a great deal of dancefloor friction. But his advance on the center stage takes him into territory well-worn with the footprints of giants of the form. To complain that Trago struggles to match the anthemism of Armand Van Helden, the lush soul of Moodymann, or the sheer physical presence of Paperclip People may be unfair, but, well, life is short and filled with great records covering the same beat. You'd probably be better served spending your time with those records, but if the prospect of inconsequential but exquisitely constructed tributes to past glories appeals, then <i>Iris</i>' eagerness to please probably won't lead you astray.</p></div>"|15512.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15512-iris/|6.6|Tim Finney

In addition to a successful solo career, his work with the Four Seasons resulted in an incredible 71 chart hits; more than half of these made the Top 40, and eight of them topped the charts. His hit-making prowess even bucked the album-oriented trends of the <i>Sgt. Pepper's</i> era, but there were some hiccups along the way. One of the most notable was a stint with Motown's short-lived MoWest imprint in the early 1970s, where Valli found himself in a slump. After a few disappointing swings at the charts, Valli tried to release ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHseZ4MskYg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">My Eyes Adored You</a>"" in 1974. MoWest passed on the record. Valli released the song late that year as a solo artist on Private Stock Records, and it topped the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 by March of the following year, ending the artist's stint on the label and kickstarting a new era of success.</p>
<p>This story is a microcosm of MoWest's inauspicious reign as the forgotten moment of one of the most iconic labels in the history of pop. The creation of the imprint was part of Berry Gordy Jr.'s gradual shift of Motown operations from Detroit to Los Angeles, away from the assembly-line production of the label's peak years. The Holland-Dozier-Holland team had already departed, replaced in part by Norman Whitfield and a raft of superstar auteurs: Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, and Diana Ross. The shift to Los Angeles also marked the end of the singular Detroit sound, as the label became reliant on a rotating cast of session musicians. But even with all the upheaval, it's difficult to figure out why MoWest fell through the cracks; the music contained in <i>Our Lives Are Shaped By What We Love: Motown's MoWest Story 1971-1973 </i>is almost uniformly great. The compilation showcases a wide range of notable artists-- a 1971 <i>Billboard</i> article notes the label's purpose was to ""expand Motown's musical horizons""-- at varying stages in their careers.</p>
<p>It was an indisputably exciting time, creatively, for soul music, in the years before disco became a codified sound. Stevie Wonder, near the beginning of his incredible decade-plus solo creative run, does make a behind-the-scenes appearance on this compilation, producing the tracks from Syreeta's debut LP. Both are highlights. Odyssey, not to be confused with the disco group of the same name, contribute three songs; each, but particularly the uptempo flute-laden horn-driven dance number ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynxqigC3DmY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Battened Ships</a>"", is a compelling example of a kind of post-hippie spiritual 70s soul. There are also early career appearances from future superstars the Commodores and Thelma Houston, whose ""I Ain't Going Nowhere"" includes an inspired vocal performance. Rock group Lodi, on the other hand, may have marked an attempt on Motown's part to move towards a psychedelic-cum-acid-folk sound, but their ""I Hope I See It in My Lifetime"" feels aimless, without the kind of memorable songwriting that defines the bulk of this compilation.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best moment on the collection is one of the record's best-known, at least to American dance floors. Although still an obscure cut by any reasonable standard, the Sisters Love's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkDMrr8LxNU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Give Me Your Love</a>"" manages to completely reinvent Curtis Mayfield's original. With its heart-damaged vocals, the song manages a rare balance of driven vulnerability over an endless, inimitable groove.  It's a strong document of the pre-disco era, but also an example of one way these oddities could endure (in this case, seeing a resurgence in a later floor-friendly edit), whatever its chart success. The primary common denominator here is that none of these artists sold well at the time. (MoWest's one hit in the United States, Tom Clay's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i2bq3F6a0I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">What The World Needs Now Is Love</a>"", is not included.) But whatever the commercial obstructions, the music certainly holds up.</p></div>"|15514.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15514-our-lives-are-shaped-by-what-we-love-motowns-mowest-story-1971-1973/|7.8|David Drake

The sole <a href=""http://bttls.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Battles</a> record to feature Tyondai Braxton's digitally cartoonified vocals, <i>Mirrored</i> is now consigned to brilliant one-off status in the Battles catalog; <i>Gloss Drop</i><span>, created after Braxton left the group entirely,</span> is more of a refinement and expansion of Battles' early work. In a way, for fans, the loss of Braxton was the best thing that could have happened to Battles. It meant they couldn't record a true follow up, which might then pale (or just come off as more of the same) next to one of the most distinctive and unexpected debut LPs of the 21st century. Battles could have recorded an all-instrumental album in the <i>Mirrored</i> mold, or they could have drafted in another singer to try and imitate Braxton's crucial contribution. Instead, they forced themselves, having lost their most immediately striking and divisive element, to move in a new and potentially radical direction. So the important questions with <i>Gloss Drop</i> become, ""Is this new direction interesting?"" and ""Have Battles made it thrilling?""</p>
<p><i> </i></p>
<p>The answers are: ""Yes,"" and ""More often than you might guess."" <i>Mirrored</i> was an album that made its impact via complexity and speed and wild humor, a sound that owed as much to the orchestral zaniness of classic cartoon soundtracks as the grimmer heads-down virtuosity of the metal and math-rock bands in which the Battles members made their names.  Not only could these guys pull off these wild instrumental zigzags at high velocity, they made ultra-tricky, computer-assisted pop-prog sound like <i>fun</i>. For their circumstances-dictated new direction, Battles have slowed their roll a bit, foregrounding both the pop and propulsive qualities of the music rather than its can-we-top-ourselves inventiveness. It still sounds like devious fun, but the sort you get from a band tweaking audience expectations.</p>
<p><i>Gloss Drop</i> is the most ride-the-groove record Battles have ever made, owing plenty to both the straight-forwardness of house and rock and the crazed syncopations of soca and dancehall, where <i>Mirrored</i>'s whole point could seem like leaving listeners breathless with this-could-go-anywhere prog invention. And considering Battles are possibly the tightest man-machine unit going now that LCD Soundsystem are dead, you can imagine how hot these grooves burn, and how meticulously they're constructed, their most audacious attempt yet to make the line between ""programmed"" and ""played"" completely invisible.</p>
<p>Of course I say these two albums shouldn't be compared, but that won't stop most people from doing just that. Inevitably the starker differences between the two will leap right out on first listen, but if you're worried about a complete makeover, <i>Gloss Drop </i>still does sound an awful lot like Battles. There's the same blurring until you can't be sure what instrument is responsible for which melodic or rhythmic element of the mix: Are those steel drums all over this record, or a guitar processed to sound that way, or some sort of ""Caribbean"" software patch? There are still the same surging moments when you're reminded, for all the band's post-human rhythmic complexity, what a great rock drummer John Stanier remains. There's still the sense of thrill that comes from music where any element coming loose would mean everything falls apart, and there's the surprise that music this fussed over can still hit so hard.</p>
<p>In a way, that's been the constant in their career, and there's often the feeling here that Battles haven't forgotten their pre-Tyondai days, where they seemed to be applying the hyper-detailed structures of math-rock to the feel of minimal techno. Battles' early EPs offered one of those shouldn't-work-but-does hybrids: prog rock, with all its furrow-browed instrumental digressions, that still somehow follows the straight-line pulse of dance music. The difference is that they learned how to be a (far) left-field pop band on <i>Mirrored</i>, and there probably wouldn't be much thrill in ditching that just to look backward. Though the tone remains gleefully plastic and mechanical, <i>Gloss Drop</i> is less forbiddingly dense, chilly, and opaque than those instrumental EPs. ""Sweetie and Shag"", with appropriately dream-pop-esque vocals from Blonde Redhead's Kazu Makino, is the most <i>tender</i> song the band's ever recorded, not a praise term you would have previously applied to Battles. If those early records resembled an auditory obstacle course, this is more of a playground, strange but inviting. Not for nothing does so much of <i>Gloss Drop</i> resemble carnival music, both in the ""rides and games"" and ""Caribbean parade"" senses of the word.</p>
<p>Sometimes this slave-to-the-rhythm approach doesn't quite come off, as on ""Futura"", where trad dance-rock is just given a frosting of virtuosity. There are moments like this on <i>Gloss Drop</i> where you remember Battles are capable of so much more than trad anything. And there are also times when the joyous silliness that runs through the record becomes oppressive, like the band's hammering you with the fact that serious music can also be super whimsical. But when it all comes together, as it does more often than not, it works on every level. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12141-ice-cream-ft-matias-aguayo/"" target=""_blank"">Ice Cream</a>"", with vocals from dance producer Matias Aguayo, is both the band's biggest and best pop moment since ""Atlas"", with a real disco bounce, but also totally perverse in its construction, like a mutated Phoenix single. And on ""My Machines"", they even call down that old (literal) tech metal thunder, with the added bonus of a big drama-queen performance from Gary Numan, one of their spiritual fathers in linking electronics with rock. Despite all the guests, and the nods to global pop, <i>Gloss Drop</i> will still be best enjoyed by groove heads, whether they come from the rock or dance worlds, but if you worried Battles would run out of surprises on album two, who knew they'd find common ground between post-punk devotees, Yes fans, and the children of UK funky?</p></div>"|15469.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15469-gloss-drop/|7.4|Jess Harvell

Obviously. The reason I'm saying that up front is that discussion of the first two Suede albums is invariably framed in a discussion of the bigger picture, both in terms of what was happening in British rock in the early 1990s and in terms of the discord within the band, particularly during 1994. There are good reasons for this. Suede were at the center of the conversation that gave us the Britpop narrative that so dominated the UK in the mid-90s. They were the band on the <a href=""http://selectmagazinescans.netii.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/cover3.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover of the issue of <i>Select</i></a> that invented Britpop as a concept, they were massively hyped before they even released anything, and their debut album was the fastest-selling in British history. They were ignored in the United States and ridiculously had to change their name in this country to the London Suede after a lawsuit by an obscure lounge singer.</p>
<p>This stuff is all important to understanding who Suede were-- the music they made, especially on their first three albums, is tied closely to their story as a band-- but I really want to make sure that as I make my way through that story, the music doesn't slip to the side of the conversation. Stories and meta-cultural narratives aside, the music is what we have to listen to now, and there is a lot of great music spread over these elaborate reissues. The whole band, including once-estranged original guitarist Bernard Butler, was involved in putting together these packages, each of them a 2xCD/DVD featuring the original album, demos, unreleased outtakes, every contemporary B-side (plus one non-album A-side), music videos, interviews and live performances. The band's entire output, with the notable exception of three early unreleased tracks, ""Be My God"", ""Art"", and ""Wonderful Sometimes"", is now available on five very well-done reissues that include all of the original artwork for both the albums and the singles. They have curated their past well.</p>
<p>Consider the arena this band was entering when it debuted in May, 1992 with ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nWJQStqrfw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Drowners</a>"". The British rock world was dominated by two waning trends, shoegaze and Madchester, both of which emphasized sound and vibe over personality and pomp. And here Suede were, with a very bold, direct, and sexually charged song that had the swagger of glam rock and was focused on the voice of Brett Anderson, who was powerful and distinctive. Anderson's vocals had a little of Bowie and a little of Morrissey, but there was a lot more there than a simple swirling of influences. Here was a guy who could sing frankly about drug abuse and rough sex without plasticizing it or stylizing it-- actions had consequences in the world he created, and wild nights had mornings after, but he was careful not to tell you the moral of the story.</p>
<p>It wouldn't always be like that, but during the brief years Butler was still in the band, Anderson was at his best as both lyricist and vocalist. The band had a good rhythm section, too. Bassist Mat Osman is a subtle force in the band, playing melodic lines that keep the songs light on their feet, even when Simon Gilbert's drumming locks in on a stomping and otherwise heavy beat. When they matched up with Butler's guitar, they were nearly as charismatic as a trio as the guy who was singing for them. ""The Drowners""-- which for all the early hype around the band (they were on the cover of <i>Melody Maker</i> a month before its release under the headline ""The Best New Band in Britain"") only charted at #49-- has a destructive energy to it that I can understand hearing as a clarion call in the musical climate of Britain in the early 90s. The opening drum stomp, soon joined by Butler's crunching, metallic riff, seems to announce the band as something different and exciting. It drips with sex before Anderson even opens his mouth.</p>
<p>""The Drowners"" is joined by three other excellent singles on the band's self-titled debut. ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rbw5FaCAzw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Metal Mickey</a>"" was the band's only song to chart in the U.S. top 10, and it is one of their best-- Butler didn't play much conventional rhythm guitar, and this song is a good early example of how his shifting lead style complemented Anderson's vocal melodies. The singles reinforced the idea that Suede were a breath of fresh air, and even though they are fairly basic rock, the band still didn't sound quite like any of their contemporaries. And there are the album tracks as well, which showed them to be a band with considerable range. The interplay between Anderson's vocal and Butler's lead guitar on ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2wozV7QAU0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sleeping Pills</a>"" is like some sort of dance, and the band makes a convincing modern murder ballad on ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6s9rbLeBlE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">She's Not Dead</a>"". And Mat Osman's bass does as much to drive the quieter songs as Butler's guitar.</p>
<p>Between albums, the band released a non-album single, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPfhAksS28g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stay Together</a>"", that signaled a shift in direction. By this point, Britpop was a real thing, at least as far as the UK music press was concerned, and Suede were being lumped in with Oasis, Blur, Cast, and a host of other bands that were being championed as the saviors of British rock. This horrified Anderson, who felt his band had very little to do with the laddish groups he was being mentioned in the same breath with, and it strengthened his resolve to move the band further away from conventional rock. Butler's relationship with the rest of the group was deteriorating; on the band's messy American tour in late 1993, he sometimes left the stage mid-gig, having a member of the Cranberries, who were opening, fill in for him. Anderson sequestered himself to write, and the songs he came up with were much darker and more introverted than anything on their mostly demonstrative debut.</p>
<p>By all accounts, the recording sessions for <i>Dog Man Star</i>, the band's masterpiece, were fraught with tension, and Butler often recorded separately, ultimately leaving the band before the album was completed. Whether that tension helped or hurt the album is debatable, but what's not in dispute is that the album is the band's very best work, completely transcending the Britpop wave they'd supposedly helped launch. In many ways, it's more like an album that might have been released in the 70s than in the 90s, and not just because of its heavy glam riffs and towering vocals. It does everything to its extreme, is unafraid of excess or bombast, and is well-structured to play as a cohesive work. From its eerily throbbing, weightless opener, ""Introducing the Band"", to the orchestral overload of its sweeping closer, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS2jjjmkGw4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Still Life</a>"", there's not a moment on the album that doesn't feel in danger of breaking down, flying apart, or disappearing entirely.</p>
<p>It's a thrilling record. I can't think of anything that's been released since that has quite the same balance of elements. It was enormously risky, but the risk paid off with big returns. Where Butler did play, he played his most inspired parts. ""New Generation"", ""We Are the Pigs"", ""Heroine"", and ""This Hollywood Life"" thrash and churn; ""The Asphalt World"" caps its slow burn with a wild and lengthy instrumental coda; and ""The Wild Ones"" might be Suede's best single, its sweeping orchestration, vocals, and guitar parts coming together in fragile but perfect balance. The quieter songs are stunning. ""Daddy's Speeding"" ends in a torrent of static and sampled engine noises that sounds like the earth tearing open, and ""The 2 of Us"" is simply gorgeous, a devastatingly sad song that doesn't feel forced or morose.</p>
<p>The reissue appends full-length versions of ""The Wild Ones"" and ""The Asphalt World"" that are significantly longer, and they're worth hearing, as are most of the other outtakes. The demos that fill out the first discs after the albums are marginally interesting, but the essential inclusion on these sets is the B-sides, all of them, from every single the band released through early 1994 (some recorded after Butler left are on the <i>Coming Up</i> reissue). Suede made B-sides that a lot of bands would die to release as lead singles-- their <i>Sci-Fi Lullabies</i> compilation, now redundant, has long been considered an essential part of their discography, and for good reason. Here, you get the elastic snap of ""Whipsnade"", the stomp of ""Killing of a Flash Boy"", the breezy swagger of ""Modern Boys"", the majesty of ""My Dark Star"", the crystalline sadness of ""The Living Dead"", and the shimmer of ""To the Birds"" right alongside the albums, and they alone make these sets worth the price. Anderson even makes alternate tracklists in his liner notes for each album, which often swap out weaker album tracks for B-sides, and I can't really argue with any of his substitutions (dropping ""The Power"" for ""My Dark Star"" and ""Black or Blue"" for ""The Living Dead"" might have been the only way to make <i>Dog Man Star</i> better).</p>
<p>The DVDs are full of good stuff-- <i>Suede</i> comes with all of its charmingly dated music videos, and <i>Dog Man Star</i> has the concert projections for the band's 1994 tour, though that album's videos are oddly absent. Each set has two live performances-- and strangely, all but one appear to have been shot by audience members rather than professionally, though the sound is acceptable. They were a very good live band, but honestly, as with most bonus DVDs, these are likely to be watched a few times and shelved. It's not bad to have this stuff available, though. More importantly, the band's discography has been consolidated, and their first two albums feel more complete with the contemporary B-sides in tow. Suede were an important band, pivotal to what the 90s came to sound like in Britain, even if they distanced themselves from it. But Suede were also a great band, and these records still sound vital all these years later.</p></div>"|15493.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15493-suede-deluxe-edition-dog-man-star-deluxe-edition/|8.4|Joe Tangari

But they're no joke now, having since released a pair of riotous albums, plus about a half-dozen trashy, cheeky, shrieking 7"" singles. They're also grizzled road warriors, headlining bars from Fargo, N.D., to Allston, Mass., in between supporting gigs with the likes of the Thermals, Mika Miko, and These Arms Are Snakes.</p>
<p>Somewhere in all that, the Coathangers must've learned how to play. <i>Larceny &amp; Old Lace</i>, the quartet's third album and second for Seattle-based Suicide Squeeze, carries over the chaotically hooky vitality of their previous records. But here, they've added more varied songwriting, (relatively) tighter instrumentation, and-- for the first time-- a real studio, the Living Room in Atlanta, where the band reunited with producer Ed Rawls (Deerhunter, Black Lips, Zoroaster). Named after a Mickey Rooney-guesting <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzCsBsJpSEA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Golden Girls"" episode</a> that was itself named after playwright Joseph Kesselring's screwball comedy <i>Arsenic and Old Lace</i>, the Coathangers' latest finds a notorious must-see live band finally capturing some of the energy of its shows on record.</p>
<p>Just because the Coathangers are taking their game more seriously doesn't mean it isn't still a game. With all four members trading off idiosyncratic vocals-- ranging from guitarist Julia Kugel's Victoria Jackson chirp to drummer Stephanie Luke's full-throated roar-- there's still plenty of jagged, playful aggression, whether that involves damning the titular jerk of ""Johnny"" over gloomy post-punk or tearing off faces between stabbing guitar and whirligig keyboard on ""Chicken: 30"". But the Coathangers now pay more attention to detail, starting with first single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/#/music-videos/685-the-coathangers/2679-hurricane/"" target=""_blank"">Hurricane</a>"", which veers from raspy shouts and brittle guitar riffs to zombie-apocalypse cheerleader chants and ominous whispers shaded by clacking drumsticks. They also try on more styles: Where ""Call to Nothing"" pledges ill-fated devotion through scratchy guitar and heavy bass recalling the Slits, ""Well Alright"" rides a demented roadhouse blues and ""My Baby"" slows down to a loping love groove-- for stalkers. These might not be the furthest-out ideas, but they're new for the Coathangers, and they're executed with badass charisma.</p>
<p>Still, from the band behind such shrill yawps as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22the+coathangers%22+%22don%27t+touch+my+shit%22&amp;aq=f"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Don't Touch My Shit""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K103W_J_MSU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Gettin' Mad and Pumpin' Iron""</a>, there's no bigger left turn than a soft, sentimental ballad. ""Tabbacco Rd."" sees the Coathangers making the shift with surprising ease, poignantly following a relationship from its first Tom Collins to the wedding chapel, and finally to the last goodbye. Speaking of goodbyes, the kitschy-scary keyboard and cathartic howls of ""Jaybird"" make it a fine memorial even if you don't recognize the lyrical reference to the Coathangers' former tourmate, the late Jay Reatard. Most impressive of all, though, and a should-be single, is ""Go Away"", a perfectly structured midtempo rocker that turns the tables on every dude who ever sang a whiny song about wanting to be more than just friends. It may have started as a simple gag-- ""Hey, I like you/ Go away""-- but it's as serious as you want it to be.</p></div>"|15478.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15478-larceny-old-lace/|7.6|Marc Hogan

But while Rollins and MacKaye built lasting legacies off the strength of their 80s work, Chalk Circle have been regulated to cult-hero status, revered by in-the-know punk fans-- including No Age's Dean Spunt, who is responsible for co-releasing this anthology on his PPM imprint.</p>
<p>Aside from Chalk Circle's rare live performances-- they played only four shows-- their obscurity could have something to do with the way their slippery post-punk didn't fit in with the righteous (if slightly homogenous) thrashing of their peers. Don Fleming points out in the liner notes that the band had even hoped for some releases on the increasingly influential Dischord Records, but the label ultimately decided they did not fit on their roster. And while that was true for the majority of their slender output, ""The Slap"" and ""Scrambled"", with all their dissonance and half-shouted lyrics, would have made for a perfect Dischord 7"".</p>
<p>Built around the songwriting partnership of Sharon Cheslow and Mary Green, Chalk Circle's sound fit in nicely with peers the Slits and the Raincoats, all creators of an innovative brand of post-punk. <i>Reflection</i> opens with its title track, and Green's introspective lyrics ensure it lives up to its name, while Cheslow's guitar dances around Tamera Lyndsay's bassline and Anne Bonafede's polyrhythmic drumming. ""My drumming was heavily inspired by the Tony DeFranco song 'Heartbeat, It's a Lovebeat',"" Bonafede states in the liner notes. ""As a matter of fact, all of my drum riffs were variations of that song."" Just like the Slits and Raincoats, Chalk Circle were ahead of their time, with ""Uneasy Friend"" adopting uneasy back-and-forth vocals and a similarly jittery energy, and closer ""Subversive Pleasure"" presaging not only modern punk bands such as Mika Miko and the Coathangers, but the entire riot grrrl movement of the late 80s and early 90s.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to her interest in poetry, Green was a pretty remarkable lyricist in a genre where words were used primarily as rocks to throw at the glass windows of the establishment. ""The Slap"" uses the image of violence against women as a metaphor for initiation into society, while ""The Look"" is an almost-satirical glance into patriarchal standards of female beauty. On ""Reflection"" and ""Easy Escapes"", Green turns the lens on herself, forging personal takes on romance and life. ""Love songs don't touch me,"" Green sings on the latter. ""But is that what I really want?""</p>
<p>With exception of ""The Look"" and the rough mix of ""Easy Escapes"", the best work on <i>Reflection</i> has already been released via early-80s tape compilations. The previously unreleased five of the album's 12 songs were live tracks and basement demos, which serve more as interesting sketches than vital documents. Peppered throughout the album, they provide rough-hewn counterparts to their studio-recorded work. They're not terribly essential, but they definitely provide a deeper context to the band's history.</p>
<p>""We wanted to have a band because we loved playing music and listening to music,"" Cheslow states in the liner notes. ""We saw girls from N.Y., L.A., San Francisco, and London playing in bands and they gave us inspiration and courage."" In 2011, the notion of an all-girl band is just as important as it ever was, primarily because we're still using the term ""all-girl band"" as if predominantly female rock groups were still a novelty of some sort. While women are unfortunately still fighting to be treated as equals-- even in the so-called ""liberal utopia"" that is underground rock music-- it becomes increasingly necessary to shed a light on the female bands that time left behind, especially ones as prescient as Chalk Circle. <i>Reflection</i> offers a broadly overlooked chapter in not just the history of women in American punk rock, but the history of American punk rock overall.</p></div>"|15441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15441-reflection/|7.5|Martin Douglas

It could also be irritating. As Pitchfork's Brian Howe <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13104-super-animal-brothers-iii/"" target=""_blank"">mentioned</a> at the time, ""It's hard to get mad at the fun,"" but EAR PWR often made it look easy. Fast-forward two years and EAR PWR have relocated to North Carolina and become something of a different animal. Removed from the spazzoid <a href=""http://www.whamcity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wham City</a> warehouse scene, the pair almost seem ready to embrace maturity.</p>
<p>Right from the ominous opening synth stabs on ""Mountain Home"", it's apparent that something is different. Amidst the goth vibes, freaky drum pattern, and weird vocal melody, you know that EAR PWR are making a conscious effort to create serious-sounding music. EAR PWR's sound here feels indebted to the Brooklyn outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27809-glasser/"" target=""_blank"">Glasser</a>, with the juxtaposition of tribal drum programming against celestial analog synths (Booze's are homemade) and an ethereal vocalist out front.</p>
<p>For EAR PWR, this evolution is admirable, but it's hard to overlook how clumsy the molting process is. For starters, Reynolds' flat delivery doesn't really work next to Booze's beefed-up (and sometimes inventive) synth work, which itself is often upstaged by his overbearing drums and invasive cymbal splashes. But having Reynolds recede into the background, given some of the awkward lyrics, isn't such a terrible thing. All in all, the record seems thin and unbalanced, its disjointedness revealing how little substance there is here. What's even more frustrating are the sparks of real possibility that keep popping up: ""Geodes"" pairs the pulse of a tornado siren with twinkling synths and some thrashed-out, forward-tumbling drums; ""Lake"" is the kind of shy, sexy jam these two should be focusing more of their attention on.</p>
<p>But in context, these more sophisticated reflections are either draggy or misguided (""North Carolina"", an ode to the duo's new home, seems meant to be regal and idyllic but sounds more like theme music from <i>The Oregon Trail</i>). EAR PWR were once a band that refused to tie a tie or recite the silly rule-- it could be annoying, but at least they were being themselves. Here, they prove how hard growing up can be.</p></div>"|15503.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15503-ear-pwr/|5.9|Zach Kelly

It was catchy and sweet, the kind of sing-along that felt like it was pulled from the air, with a sentiment perfect for anyone stuck in an office or addicted to the Internet. But how many communal sing-alongs can a band make before the approach goes stale? Cults have opted not to find out. ""Go Outside"" is on their debut album, and it still gives you your entire recommended daily allowance of vitamin D, but its dreamy drift is just one side of a band that proves it has the dexterity and songwriting chops to make a varied and memorable album.</p>
<p>Much has been made about the speed with which Cults signed to Columbia, as if they're the first group to release a debut album on a major. That kind of rapid ascent isn't anything new, but the speculation that came with it-- online chatter pronouncing them destined for the one-hit-wonder bin-- now looks grossly off the mark. At the center of the band's appeal is singer Madeline Follin's youthful alto. She has a tone that creates the impression you're listening to a precocious tween fronting a band well versed in Phil Spector's <i>Back to Mono</i> and three decades of climactic indie pop. The 1960s girl-pop element of their sound is pretty evident on the surface-- ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12150-you-know-what-i-mean/"" target=""_blank"">You Know What I Mean</a>"" even borrows its verse melody from the Supremes' ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlgHudEv_VA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Where Did Our Love Go</a>""-- but what they've done with it is pure 21st century, cutting it with synths, guitars, and softly integrated samples.</p>
<p>The samples, of cult leaders speaking to their followers, could have been a distraction had they chosen to make a big deal out of them, but they're woven tightly into the album's sonic fabric and processed to varying degrees of decipherability, which turns them into an effective textural element. Those voices bounce around in the intro to ""Oh My God"", originally released last year as part of Adult Swim's singles program, but subtly remixed for the LP. The music hasn't changed here but the beat is amped up, and the bass has been moved forward in the mix, giving the song a much more powerful groove to support its melody. And if Follin's lyrics aren't necessarily deep-- ""I can run away and leave you anytime/ Please don't tell me you know the plans for my life""-- she delivers them with relatable and affecting conviction.</p>
<p>This taps into a vein of petulance that runs through the album. ""I don't need anyone else,"" from ""Never Saw the Point"", may read as a tossed-off line, but in a strangely positive way, it feels like the record's main message. Even the eternally sunny ""Go Outside"" ends on the lyric, ""I think I want to live my life and you're just in my way."" These are teenage sentiments, the kind of things you feel dumb for saying and thinking once you've navigated into your mid-twenties, but they're also universal sentiments during that stage of life when you're trying to figure out what kind of person you're going to be. Cults' use of elements borrowed from traditionally teen music-- girl groups, 50s prom-pop, bedroom indie pop-- plays along with the lyrics to create a little world where one minute Follin is singing a frustrated ""fuck you"" (""Never Heal Myself"") and dreaming of escaping the next. Even the more formal pop explorations play to teen melodrama. The surging Spector pop of the record's anthemic opener ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12172-abducted/"" target=""_blank"">Abducted</a>"" compares falling in love to being kidnapped, and gives the other Cult, Brian Oblivion, a brief lead vocal to play the abductor.</p>
<p>At just over a half hour, <i>Cults</i> feels like the perfect length-- just long enough for the bus ride to school (or to work). But more importantly, it executes what it sets out to do masterfully while allowing the group room to grow and mature. They've also set themselves up to take their sound and subject matter in any number of possible directions in the future, and that's a good position for a young band to find itself in. Cults built up a lot of goodwill last year on the strength of just three tracks; on their debut album, they've rewarded it.</p></div>"|15432.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15432-cults/|8.5|Joe Tangari

That pairing felt like an inevitable convergence of like-minded talents-- two similarly wayward outfits naturally coming together. Both have gone though stages of late-career reinvention, both have a fondness for repetitive psychedelic rock music played loud, and both have demonstrated scant regard for conventional career trajectories. At that point Oneida were two albums deep into a proposed trilogy titled <i>Thank Your Parents</i>. The fact that they decided to play a 12-hour set, complete with a double drummer assault from Lips sticksmen Steven Drozd and Kliph Scurlock at one point, made a strange kind of sense. It felt like Oneida were in the process of untethering themselves from their own sound, of cutting loose common constructs that had been threaded through their prior work. In <i>Absolute II</i>, the third and final segment of <i>Thank Your Parents</i>, that evolution has been taken to its most far-out point yet.</p>
<p>Of all the strands that make up the trilogy, which began with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12031-preteen-weaponry/"">Preteen Weaponry</a></i> in 2008 and continued with the triple album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13215-rated-o/"">Rated O</a></i> in 2009, this is the one that makes least sense as a standalone item. It's very much a part of a greater whole, a logical if somewhat obtuse and reflective way to enter the comedown phase after the wild diversity of the previous installment. With all three pieces slotted together, it's easier to process the other material. The studio trickery and dub-influenced tunes of <i>Preteen Weaponry</i>, which was split into three songs but designed to be listened to as a continuous track, now feels like a perfect ease-in entry point to the sprawl of <i>Rated O</i>. But finding a similar way in to <i>Absolute II</i> takes some work. There are no drums here and barely any vocals. Anything that could be defined as ""traditional"" instrumentation is largely absent. Initially, it feels impenetrable. Almost everything is locked in stasis, with tiny phrases and pulses occasionally prickling to the surface.</p>
<p>As such, it's firmly rooted in the minimalist tradition. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a>'s ""Pendulum Music"" is a touchstone, as is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"">Philip Glass</a>'s ""1+1"". At times it bears a similar textural heft to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>'s work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8602-harold-budd/"">Harold Budd</a> on their <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11731-discreet-musicambient-1-music-for-airportsambient-2-the-plateaux-of-mirror-with-harold-buddambient-4-on-land/"">The Plateaux of Mirror</a></i> collaboration. In terms of eyebrow-raising deviations in style it's not dissimilar to the arcane moods of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker/"">Scott Walker</a>'s <i><a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Scott+Walker/Tilt"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tilt</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8764-the-drift/"">The Drift</a></i>. Like <i>Preteen Weaponry</i> this isn't an album that needed to be divided into individual tracks, although there are four of them, beginning with ""Pre Human"". The opening is built around a single repeating keyboard riff that's lightly distorted and sounds not unlike something Martin Rev from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"">Suicide</a> might have left on the cutting room floor around the time of their first album. It feels like a reflex shift out of the jagged edges of <i>Rated O</i> and into calmer waters, especially when it relaxes into solitary organ drones and droplets of water-like piano plinks.</p>
<p>But the mood of <i>Absolute II</i> oscillates somewhere between turmoil and ease, with the stretched out tones of ""Pre Human"" ultimately congealing into the hostile atmosphere of ""Horizon"". Here, the solitary vocal lines on the album are cut so they speak a curious un-language, which is set to aggressive machine noise that feels like a feverish itch prickling away under the skin. It's the dark side of Eno's dream for ambient, or the notion of <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Erik+Satie"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Erik Satie</a>'s ""furniture music"" gone horribly wrong. Something that should sink into the background is ultimately turned on its head and shoved in your face instead. ""Horizon"" is painful at high volume, and it's most likely designed to be listened to that way. From there ""Gray Area"" continues in much the same vein, with its clanging guitar motif ratcheting up the inhospitable atmosphere. It's like Oneida have locked you out of their world and are making it as difficult as they can for you to re-enter.</p>
<p>This isn't music as escapism, it's music as challenge and provocation. Even the closing title track, which is all hushed-out generator hum and occasional murmurs of instrumentation, falls loosely into the same kind of disconcerting atmosphere as the incidental music to David Lynch's <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074486/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eraserhead</a></i>. Oneida are often talked about as a band that should have reached a wider audience, but they won't achieve that here, and they don't seem to care. They're a group whose music takes a great deal of time to sink in, where the process of evaluation slowly unravels over years and months rather than days and minutes. It's the reason why their album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5996-each-one-teach-one/"">Each One Teach One</a></i>, which is nine years old, is only now being fully unpacked and canonized as a major piece of work. <i>Thank Your Parents</i> will take an equivalent span of time to reveal its secrets, especially as this final part is likely to be met with a large degree of bafflement on first listen. But taken as a concluding piece of a larger body of work, as this is intended to be heard, it's a fiercely individual statement to end this chapter in Oneida's unique history.</p></div>"|15490.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15490-absolute-ii/|7.2|Nick Neyland

There was the 2008 album <i>Everyone is Crying Out to Me, Beware</i>, where Simone covered songs by the Siberian folk-punk singer <a href=""http://themayanempire.com/yanka/yanka.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yanka Dyagileva</a>. There is Simone's new memoir, <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/You-Must-Go-Win-Essays/dp/0865479151"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You Must Go and Win</a></i>, which addresses ""the lure of a mythical Russian home"" she left as an infant as well as the foibles of the American music industry. And on her new album, <i>Make Your Own Danger</i>, there's a song about <a href=""http://www.oldrussia.net/baba.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Baba Yaga</a>, the legendary Slavic witch whose house walks around on chicken legs. Under its gypsy veneer, it reminds me a bit of the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQtLoJlQD6E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Smashing Pumpkins' ""Disarm""</a>, which is telling.</p>
<p>The American music business can be a precarious place for homegrown artists with foreign roots, and Simone has generally seemed leery of fetishizing her heritage for American markets. She seems to deploy her background with a mixture of personal interest and business savvy. On <i>Make Your Own Danger</i>, Eastern European folk tropes are pretty scarce, and mainly function as a bit of marketable window dressing for the music Simone really seems to love, vintage alt-rock. This is someone who gave her 2005 debut EP the supremely ""1990s"" title <i>of Prettier in the Dark</i>, and who inherits a tradition that PJ Harvey defined in the 90s and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/shannonwright"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shannon Wright</a> carried on in the 2000s: strong, intense women with smoldering voices set to melodious yet slashing music. Simone may dream of that mythical Ukrainian home, but she expresses herself in the language of crunchy rhythm guitars, chiming leads, and confessional vocals that has soundtracked her American life.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Simone was more like these artists in sound than spirit-- there was something tentative about her earliest efforts. But <i>Make Your Own Danger</i> betrays a growing assertiveness. Its bedrock of coffeehouse singer/songwriter fare and lean, propulsive rock gains distinction and variety with the addition of chamber instruments and hand percussion. It still has the delicate rawness that is central to Simone's music, but with more layers of arrangement than ever before. The flute on ""Apocalyptic Lullaby"" offsets the lumbering doom-folk with welcome lightness, and ""Glitterati"", whose hovering percussion and guitars surprisingly evoke <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/4548-the-walkmen/"">the Walkmen</a>, is one of the most striking songs we've heard from Simone to date-- to say nothing of the Velvet Underground-derived trance she conjures on ""You Fade Away"" or the effortlessly gorgeous ballad ""Just Here to Watch the Show"".</p>
<p>Her voice has gotten more formidable too. There are a couple of songs where she's a little smaller in the mix than would seem ideal: ""Day Glow Avenue"" represents the record at its most polite. But for the most part, her singing is both forceful and subtle. It draws out the nuances of lyrics that are full of sinister but deflected evocations of some beautiful oblivion. Pivotal events lurk around every corner here, before and behind, seldom revealed. As someone who seems to always be on the verge of blowing up, that must be a feeling Simone knows well. Maybe her unwillingness to go all in as an American classic or Eastern European curiosity hasn't ingratiated her with a marketplace that likes tidy narratives, and maybe she's getting a little fed up with it. When a shotgun goes off in the harbor on ""Gunshots"", you can hear the bang in her voice.</p></div>"|15506.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15506-make-your-own-danger/|7.2|Brian Howe

One afternoon, the right musician saw him play, became his manager, hitched him to a tour with champions Fleet Foxes, and landed him a record deal with one of the country's most trustworthy syndicates of old sounds, Tompkins Square. Now, he's the subject of a documentary and a touring musician with audiences in multiple continents. In a time where musicians and their managers attend workshops on going viral, and when the companies that own the music plan album leaks in advance, Fairfield simply played because he somehow had to talk about his feelings. Everything else just found him.</p>
<p>Fairfield's debut collected his interpretations and arrangements of 11 traditional tunes; <i>Out on the Open West</i>, the follow-up to his 2009 entrée, features three arrangements of traditional tunes, and they're all instrumentals-- the halting ""Haste to the Wedding/The Darling True Love"", the ebullient ""Turkey in the Straw/Arkansas Traveler"", and the foot-stomping ""Texas Farewell"". But the best songs here are Fairfield's own, and they're tremendous achievements from a guy who once said he wasn't a songwriter: ""But That's Alright"" is a sad, spirited bit of self-medication, the title phrase muttered in the chorus with the same kind of bitter resolve that tides people through strings of bad news.</p>
<p>On ""Kings County Breakdown"", he bows with a get-out-of-town abandon, like he's racing away from a hard week's work for his favorite vacation spot, or more likely, his baby. ""Ruthie"" is a tender, torturous goodbye. Fairfield is a strong player, but here, he smartly fumbles along the banjo's neck, the lament's lyrical depression mirrored by the broken technique. ""Who will set her coffin? Lord, who will lay her down? Who will lay sweet Ruthie in that cold rocky ground?"" he sings before answering that he will. The despair is overwhelming. <i>Out on the Open West</i>, then, not only cements Fairfield as a remarkable performer but also suggests that he's an evocative writer with his own stories to share.</p>
<p>It also puts Fairfield squarely in the folk tradition of collaboration. His self-titled debut was mostly Fairfield. On ""Kings County Breakdown"", though, he's sawing his fiddle alongside mentor and guitarist Tom Marion. That's young colleague Jerron ""Blind Boy"" Paxton singing perfectly content harmonies on ""But That's Alright"" and Old Crow Medicine Show's Willie Watson doing the cheery picking on the title track. But the most remarkable moment in Fairfield's slender catalog is ""Poor Old Lance"", a stunning bit of sadness that puts him squarely in the league of his heroes. Assisted by a trio of fiddle players, Fairfield sings with the sort of human moan that you can hear in Doc Watson's blues or any number of Harry Smith or Alan Lomax's field recordings. These troubles have never seemed more like Fairfield's own.</p>
<p>Fairfield is worthy of your consideration, even if you've never heard or considered the old-time music. He plays with a rare integrity, offering up his life in a way that does exactly what folk music must do-- it relates the world as the singer sees it, mixing sadness with sweetness, excitement with low-down and miserable depression. This has nothing to do with genre; hip-hop, jazz and rock all feel this way, too. Like the best of it all, Fairfield's music seems inexorably real and entirely necessary.</p></div>"|15504.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15504-out-on-the-open-west/|8.0|Grayson Currin

The restless Norwegian has a wide range of musical curiosities, and in 10 years and seven albums he's covered quite a bit of ground, from the subdued, Nick Drake-inspired folk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4743-faces-down/"" target=""_blank""><i>Faces Down</i></a> to the Chet Baker jazz of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4745-duper-sessions/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Duper Sessions</i></a> to the harder rock of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9872-phantom-punch/"" target=""_blank""><i>Phantom Punch</i></a>. Perhaps his most representative work to date has been the soundtrack to the largely forgotten Steve Carell flick <i>Dan in Real Life</i>, and that's primarily because it shuffles new tracks and scene-setting instrumentals among songs from his previous albums, as if Lerche meant to take stock of his own past. His range is certainly respectable, but also a bit precocious, as if such diversity were an end in itself. So when he self-titles an album-- especially his seventh full-length-- it can't just be out of laziness or lack of creativity.</p>
<p>Whether intentional or not, <i>Sondre Lerche</i> does present something like a defining sound, with all the traits that have threaded throughout his albums over the years: the slightly off-key croon, the meticulous attention to arrangement, the emphasis on melody over all else, the impeccable choice of backing musicians (including Vetiver's Bob Parins on harmonica, Midlake's McKenzie Smith on drums, and Lerche's stepfather-in-law on accordion). There are nods to Brill Building formalism, 1970s singer-songwriter fare, subdued bossa nova, and polite power pop, each integrated studiously into the whole. The result might be called indie AOR: intelligent, tasteful, largely unobtrusive, certainly knowledgeable of pop history. It would surprise exactly no one if he ended up recording with Norah Jones (that's not a slam: say what you will about her music, but she has pretty <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11652-stuck/"">solid</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14731-write-about-love/"">taste</a> in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIlW-5DLt_A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">collaborators</a>).</p>
<p>Perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of <i>Sondre Lerche</i> is how willing he is to simply let these songs devour themselves: to fall apart or fade away in unexpected ways. ""Nevermind the Typos"" descends from legible script to scrawled handwriting, as the drums, bass, strings, and guitar play against instead of with one another, and ""Tied Up to the Tide"" closes on an angular accordion solo that's one of the album's most intriguingly jarring moments. This self-destructive impulse makes for an interesting contrast to Lerche's highly organized and precisely arranged pop, but he relegates it to a few asides without really pursuing that chaos-against-order friction. He's simply too bound to order, such that even the runaway chorus of ""Private Caller"" sounds like it knows exactly where it's running away to. The drama of ""Domino"" and closer ""When the River"" sounds prescribed, too scripted for a performer whose live shows suggest a spontaneity that's impossible to recreate on record. For all the mission-statement confidence that its title exudes, <i>Sondre Lerche</i> sounds strangely divided: It's too pristine and too scattershot.</p></div>"|15496.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15496-sondre-lerche/|5.8|Stephen M.

Until late last year, they went by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28693-games/"" target=""_blank"">Games</a>, but after legal snags (or, as Lopatin referred to it on Twitter, a ""shwagy situation""), they decided to keep it to their surnames.</p>
<p>Some of the duo's earliest releases came in the form of a series of mixtapes: the double-cassette <i><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/games/spend-the-night-with-games-side-a"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spend the Night With Games</a></i> and the three-volume set <i><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/games/heaven-can-wait-mixtape-vol-i-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heaven Can Wait</a>.</i> Those tapes pointed to some of the influences that would materialize in their own tracks, exploring chopped-and-screwed 80s slow jams, glistening funk tracks, and turn-of-the-90s new age club hits. They also straddled the line between sincere appreciation and goofball irony, a characteristic which carried over to Games' sugary synth-pop debut EP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14840-that-we-can-play-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>That We Can Play</i></a>. The duo's penchant for sly irreverence came out in their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/39680-rising-games/"" target=""_blank"">Pitchfork interview</a> last year, too, when Ford cited as one of their visual influences ""anything that reminds us of our dads at work.""</p>
<p>But despite these playful gestures, there's no messing around in what Ford &amp; Lopatin do in the studio. While recording their debut album, <i>Channel Pressure</i>, F&amp;L took their fondness for the sounds of the 1980s one step further and tracked the album at the studio of Jan Hammer, who composed the immortal <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jan+hammer+miami+vice+theme&amp;aq=f"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Miami Vice"" theme</a>. Accordingly, <i>Channel Pressure</i> is an impossibly slick and glossy record with sweet and sticky hooks that underscore the duo's talent for infusing pop songwriting with something beamed in from another era.</p>
<p>The last time the pair experimented with vocals was on <i>That We Can Play</i>'s ""Strawberry Skies"", which featured fellow retro-futurist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28822-laurel-halo/"" target=""_blank"">Laurel Halo</a>; while that song was a little dry and inert, <i>Channel Pressure</i>'s most straightforward moments shudder and gleam with propulsive melody (the wide-stride disco of ""Joey Rogers"") and jittery, squelched arrangements (album highlights ""Too Much Midi (Please Forgive Me)"" and ""World of Regret""). The record's success owes a lot to its bold and clear vocals, handled by Ford and Jeff Gitelman of psychedelic soul revivalists the Stepkids. Their voices are often coated in electronic effects, but they move in and out of the music with a natural, brightly delivered pulse. The biggest surprise of all comes from avant-R&amp;B weirdo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29170-autre-ne-veut/"" target=""_blank"">Autre Ne Veut</a>, who smooths out his wild delivery on the slow-burning ""I Surrender"".</p>
<p>The album would be tiring if were nothing but a sincere homage to the cheesy pop of yesteryear, but F&amp;L temper <i>Channel Pressure</i> with abstract vocal exercises and overcast instrumentals to keep the balance right. This careful structure might owe something to the album's extremely loose concept (something about a cyberpunk named Joey Rogers). Still, some of the instrumentals come over as merely functional-- not bad, but also not exactly tracks you return to out of context-- so even though there are song-focused highlights, <i>Channel Pressure</i> is ultimately to be taken whole. And part of the fun is in tuning into the collective ""ear"" of its makers, and hearing these beautifully rendered 80s sounds the way one suspects <i>they</i> hear them. So it's funny and referential and sometimes not completely engaging, but it also feels celebratory. As suggested by the electronics obsession of the album cover, the world of <i>Channel Pressure</i> is overstuffed and ridiculous, but also an enticing invitation to plug in and drop out.</p></div>"|15502.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15502-channel-pressure/|7.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

Though they've staked out in different territories in terms of both production and influence, both headliners embody an ideal of what indie rock meant in the 1990s. Pains and Surfer Blood are heavy on the guitars, with songs written and recorded by four or five people in a room, each of whom has an easily identifiable job-- essentially a scrappier version of the ""alternative rock"" on the radio back in the day. Meanwhile, Hooray For Earth are what people are thinking of right now: songs composed on synthesizers that take cues from dance and psychedelia, fluidity between the roles of the players. But all in all, game recognized game, for on <i>True Loves</i>, Hooray For Earth also display a precocious knack for massive, major-key hooks that are ""indie rock"" in name only.</p>
<p>As you could probably guess from the preceding description, advance singles ""True Loves"" and ""Sails"" placed the New York quartet in the packed house of bands often tagged with ""what we wished <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14122-congratulations/"" target=""_blank""><i>Congratulations</i></a> sounded like."" It's unfair on both counts, robbing MGMT of some sort of agency in their artistic trajectory and limiting Hooray For Earth in terms of scope. With its candy-coated vocals and fluorescent production, <i>True Loves</i> siphons color from all points on the synth-pop spectrum. The spiky arpeggios of ""Realize It's Not the Sun"" and ""Sails"" pay homage to the Knife as well as Depeche Mode's arena-ready 90s, but each employs them for divergent purposes. And the title track offers upstroked, ska-rhythm guitars and Noel Heroux's dexterous falsetto run, along with dub-like painting around the edges with eerie, desiccated sound effects.</p>
<p>Though sounding more like a singles collection than a coherent album-length vision, <i>True Loves</i> seems to unfold in a way that shows Hooray For Earth steadily accruing melodic confidence. While the six minutes of electro-tribal mantras on closer ""Black Trees"" recall earlier Yeasayer, the nervy palm-muted guitars and bold synth-horn charts of ""No Love"" and ""Bring Us Closer Together"" easily top <i>Odd Blood</i>'s attempts at Trevor Horn-styled 80s chartbusters.</p>
<p>But the sequencing isn't perfect: In between the killer bookends, serviceable mid-album palate cleansers ""Same"" and ""Hotel"" form a 10-minute stretch that roams a bit too far off course before the big reveals. The lull in momentum is more pronounced since the lyrics can be simultaneously too plainspoken and standoffish: As extroverted as these songs sound, you really never get a full sense of Hooray For Earth's personality. Still, it's no slight to say they've allowed themselves room for growth after <i>True Loves</i>, and there's little reason to believe their name won't be at the top of the marquee on the next go-round.</p></div>"|15340.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15340-true-loves/|7.9|Ian Cohen

In aesthetic terms, they're on a very similar wavelength. They both gravitate toward tense rhythms and a particular timbre in their keyboard parts that is at once totally menacing and vaguely cheesy. They both integrate elements of theater and performance art into their live shows. Most obviously, Rostron and Knife singer Karin Dreijer Andersson share a fascination with inhabiting male characters and exploring masculinity in their songs, to the point of pitching their voices down into a grotesque parody of manliness.</p>
<p>Rostron does this trick on ""Doorway"", the opening track of her second full-length album, <i>W</i>, and the result is a song that could easily pass for an outtake from the Knife's <i>Silent Shout</i>. This is a compliment, to a point. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4590-silent-shout/"" target=""_blank""><i>Silent Shout</i></a> is a remarkable album, so it's a flattering-- if somewhat superficial-- comparison. At the same time, that record is so singular and self-contained that there may not be need for anything else to sound like it, including future music by the Knife themselves.</p>
<p>Rostron is a lot more interesting the further she gets from the sound of the Dreijer siblings. She established a distinct aesthetic on her debut, <i>Have It All</i>, and that style carries over to a large chunk of <i>W</i>. In these songs, she sings in a bold, sexually assertive style over riffs played on cello or keyboards. In one of her best recordings, a string arrangement of ""Think That Thought"" from the <i>Have It All Stringed Up</i> EP, she ends up sounding almost exactly like Robert Plant singing over a string quartet.</p>
<p>She still recalls Plant here and there on <i>W</i>, but this time around, she's a bit closer to Annie Lennox, another female vocalist with a confident, soulful style and an androgynous tone. ""The Breaks"", <i>W</i>'s atmospheric centerpiece, showcases this quality. Her voice is the most dynamic sound in the song, sketching out a complex mix of conflicting emotions while the rest of the arrangement settles into a sad, mellow keyboard-horn groove. It's a quietly compelling piece of music-- intensely passionate yet strangely subdued.</p>
<p>She's even more impressive on the album highlight ""I Am Your Man"", a twitchy showstopper with an ironic, gender-bending perspective and an earnest, love-struck sentiment. In this song, masculinity is invoked more than it is critiqued. It's a celebration of being forthright and aggressive, of being bold enough to pursue someone with the firm belief that you're the right person for them. It's not that different from, say, Jeff Tweedy singing ""I'm the Man Who Loves You"", but Rostron's gender flip brings an intriguing tension to the mix. Is this the person she wants? Is this the person she wants to be?</p>
<p>There are other fine songs on <i>W</i>-- the tense disco track ""Living It Out"", the sultry ""Manifesto""-- but as a whole, the record doesn't quite gel. The songs generally sound better out of context. This makes some sense. Though the pieces have a lot of musical similarities, each comes across as a discrete composition with its own set of ideas. In that way, <i>W</i> feels less like a pop album and more like a gallery show.</p></div>"|15498.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15498-w/|6.7|Matthew Perpetua

From Holland comes ""bubbling,"" a jittery, uptempo skitter with origins in the late 1980s, born from spinning dancehall records too fast. Meanwhile, in 2009 U.S. DJ Dave Nada slowed down Dutch house records to 108 beats per minute until the music (already part-Caribbeanized) uncannily resembled the throbbing pulse of reggaeton. Add cut-up Latin vocals, dem bow off-beats, crisp and seemingly endless drum rolls, and a bevy of obvious samples, and a new genre is born.</p>
<p>""Moombahton"" takes its name from the Afrojack remix of Silvio Ecomo and DJ Chuckie's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ9RiNOLOc8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Moombah""</a> (the ""-ton"" comes from reggaeton), but the idea is expressed most succinctly in Nada's remix of Sidney Samson's Afrojack-like anthem <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-uPSNvRRtM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Riverside""</a>. On the latter, the original's grating siren synth attack transmuted into a bleepy melody of unbearable tension. It's tempting to assume that transcending this simple gimmick would be necessary for moombahton to produce anything of lasting worth, but that's not the case. As Nada's new mix <i>Blow Your Head Vol. 2 </i>(for Diplo's <a href=""http://www.maddecent.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mad Decent</a> label) proves, there's nothing wrong with a decent gimmick.</p>
<p>In fact, moombahton works by treating <i>everything </i>as a gimmick. Just as big beat reduced both rap and rave to sample toolkits to be mined for maximum party hijinks, moombahton usually treats its Latin and Caribbean affectations as ruthlessly as it does house records. At times it's hard to say just who is spiking whom: As well as raw source material, the house components of moombahton paradoxically act as a stylistic destabilizer, like a returning comet throwing the music out of orbit. Take Sabo's remix of Dennis Ferrer's strobing vocal house anthem ""Hey Hey"", wherein the original's sharp counter-rhythm becomes a desultory strut around which Sabo weaves an exquisite rumpshaker groove.</p>
<p>If anything, <i>Blow Your Head Vol. 2</i>, which gathers together a selection of tracks from moombahton's key producers, is at its weakest when the tunes veer too close to naturalizing their influences, and risk sounding too comfortable with themselves. Munchi's ""Sandungueo"" could easily be a malnourished, thuggish dub of an actual reggaeton record. Conversely, ""Gal Where Yuh Come From"" by Nadastrom (a duo of Nada and Matt Nordstrom) squeezes out just the right amount of estrangement from the music it mimics via an ominous rap from Jamaican DJ Natalie Storm, whip-crack snares, and a murky, dub-spacious arrangement.</p>
<p>Nada pays respect to moombahton's roots by including cuts from ancestral reggaeton rapper El General and Shabba Ranks' ""Dem Bow"", but the best inclusions here work their magic by wearing these influences lightly and setting their sights more broadly. On tracks ""Masta Blasta"", ""Broken Hearts"", and ""Que Que"", Dillon Francis has developed a bevy of tricks-- stuttering electro kicks; woozy and disorienting synth lines-- that fuse European slither with Caribbean bounce.</p>
<p>It would be meaningless, not to mention faintly ridiculous, to start talking about ""sophisticated"" or ""experimental"" moombahton, in part because the music is so rigorously party-focused. But there's also a stylistic restlessness that makes <i>Blow Your Head Vol. 2 </i>a more surprising listen than you might expect. The mix closes with Nadastrom's remix of Win Win's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEKi6lnTtLM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rleleaserpm""</a>, which could be a dancefloor renegade from the latest Gang Gang Dance album (in fairness, that <i>is</i> GGD's Lizzie Bougatsos on vocals). Crucially, this gorgeously sunny number never sounds impressed with its own unexpectedness: In the middle of moombahton's no-nonsense party vibes, pretty much anything is up for grabs.</p></div>"|15500.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15500-blow-your-head-vol-2-dave-nada-presents-moombahton/|7.6|Tim Finney

This is the text in the ""about me"" section of folksinger David Thomas Broughton's <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/davidthomasbroughton"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook page</a>, where he is listed as a ""local business.""  Above it is a picture of Broughton looking very startled. The photo and the line make me laugh and, occasionally, so does Broughton's music, which mixes spare, matter-of-fact playing with a dry sense of humor and a self-effacing willingness to improvise.</p>
<p>Take a line like, ""In the main all that I can glean is that this is the reason that this world is fucked,"" from <i>Outbreeding</i>'s ""Electricity"".  Prim syntax and barstool frustration collide in a rich baritone. Broughton pronounces ""fucked"" <i>fooked</i>, and the humor lies in the fact that he sings it as though it weren't funny. Thirty seconds later, the song devolves into unexpectedly dissonant keyboards and snippets of prerecorded talking.</p>
<p><i>Outbreeding</i> is the most band-oriented record he's released. (For comparison, he recorded 2005's <i>The Complete Guide to Insufficiency</i> alone in a church with the help of looping pedals.) He's said in interviews that he has a greater interest in trying new ideas than rehashing old ones, which is an attitude I admire in artists, especially when they can carry it off and sound curious instead of prickish.</p>
<p>Broughton's voice is distinctive enough to anchor each track, but <i>Outbreeding</i> feels like it lacks a central character or thread. Some songs lean toward driving, structured folk-pop; some are lumbering and discordant. I like the comparatively poppy ones, but mostly because they showcase an intelligent juxtaposition of brisk, twinkly music with Broughton's natural melancholy. (I still love the chant-like atmosphere of <i>The Complete Guide to Insufficiency</i>, but the more downbeat tracks here don't have the same grace).</p>
<p>Broughton's ideas are still worth hearing though, and his voice works for me (even though it might be feast-or-famine for other listeners). Like the folksinger <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10015-sam-amidon/"" target=""_blank"">Sam Amidon</a>, his music sometimes feels indebted to a rustic, pre-Dylan past but is buoyed by a mischievous personality-- he takes something that sounds pat at first and turns it into something skewed and unusual. And like Amidon, Broughton's live shows are miniature spectacles: He roams through the crowd and uses furniture as percussion. He layers sounds in slightly haphazard ways, as though his songs weren't so holy that he couldn't subject them to chance.</p>
<p>That kind of loose imagination and playfulness is not only hard to capture on record, it's probably impossible. The moment dissolves by nature, whereas recorded music wants to stick around forever. Broughton-- like Amidon-- will always be one of those artists probably better seen than heard, though somehow I imagine that doesn't bother him. Even on its less interesting tracks, there's something about <i>Outbreeding</i> that feels warm and content, like it was glad to be made.</p></div>"|15487.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15487-outbreeding/|6.9|Mike Powell

But listening to it, I didn't peg Woods as the kind of band that would keep turning out remarkably well-realized and consistent albums on a yearly basis. Maybe it was the casual nature of their time-keeping, where all the songs amble at a loose, oblong gait. Or maybe it was the general nature of their lo-fi pedigree, where quantity of output is often prized over quality. But nothing about Woods at that time said ""consistent album band"" to me.</p>
<p>Two years and two full-lengths later, ""consistent album band"" describes Woods very well. Last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14224-at-echo-lake/"" target=""_blank""><i>At Echo Lake</i></a> didn't have a weak song on it and showcased the strength of their songwriting on the most fundamental terms. I still find myself humming tunes from it at weird times, even when I haven't listened to it in months. Now they return with <i>Sun and Shade</i>, another very solid record that finds them returning in spots to the experimental vein explored on earlier records and in their live show. They haven't changed their sound in the least, but they're demonstrating that there's a lot more to be done with it than might have been expected.</p>
<p>The experimentation comes in the form of two longer instrumentals that take up about 17 of the album's 44 minutes. ""Out of the Eye"" is a Krautrock homage constructed from the basic ingredients of Neu!'s ""Hallogallo"", but slowed down by a third and with a Middle Eastern tinge in the guitars. Where bands like Stereolab built something driving and forceful around the iconic motorik groove of the Neu! original, Woods' rickety aesthetic can't help but keep human imperfection in the mix. These guys don't do ""robotic,"" and no one will ever mistake the laid-back percussion on a Woods record for a drum machine. Which means that the shadowy steady-state psych of ""Out of the Eye"" unfolds patiently and isn't afraid to meander a little. But when it closes abruptly with a quick drum roll seven minutes in, it gives the impression that the preceding was more of a sketch or one-take jam rather than anything designed for a specific effect, which slightly undercuts its power.</p>
<p>The nearly 10-minute ""Sol y Sombra"" is the other long track, and it features spare hand percussion, acoustic guitars, and some distant electric guitar leads. It still scans as ""1970s Germany,"" but here the basic model is the pastoral psych of Popol Vuh from the middle of that decade. They both manage to capture a mood and wring feeling out of them, but ""Sol y Sombra"" and ""Out of the Eye"" sometimes have me reaching for the ""skip"" button. That's partly because Woods continue to craft such memorable tunes when working in guitar-pop mode.</p>
<p>Like ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12163-pushing-onlys/"" target=""_blank"">Pushing Onlys</a>"", the early single from <i>Sun and Shade</i>, which has chiming guitars and a classic pop melody catchy enough to hang with 60s confections by the Turtles or the Hollies. While Jeremy Earl's cracking voice is in the long line of ""sounds kinda like Neil Young"" high tenors, Woods' Aquarian Age references often lean toward the bouncy and optimistic bubblegum of the era. Here, that spirit comes to the fore on the elegant shuffle ""Who Do I Think I Am?"" and ""What Faces the Sheet"", which is built around a guitar riff vaguely reminiscent of ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE_jOD2Fxvs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Then He Kissed Me</a>"". Folkier songs like ""Be All Be Easy"" and ""Wouldn't Waste"" bring to mind the sound of folk-pop heroes growing into singer-songwriters, a spirit best exemplified by Graham Nash, whom Woods covered on <i>Songs of Shame</i>. In whatever mode they're working, the take-away is that Woods are good at all these sounds, and they seem to be striving to get even better. Despite their ultra-slack style and prodigious output, nothing about them says ""half-assed,"" so it's another year, another fine Woods album.</p></div>"|15499.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15499-sun-and-shade/|7.9|Mark Richardson

<p class=""MsoNormal"">That's Patrick Wolf doing the <a href=""http://www.digitalspy.com/music/interviews/a305510/patrick-wolf.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">heavy-lifting</a> when it comes to pinpointing what went wrong with <i>Lupercalia: </i>It's clear he hasn't shaken off his <i>artiste </i>pretensions since the goth-folk of his early work, but ever since the career peak of 2005's shadowy song cycle<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8774-wind-in-the-wires/"" target=""_blank"">Wind in the Wires</a></i>, he seems to want pop stardom.<span> </span>And while the clash of those desires can lead to fascinating music, it rarely happens when the artist considers himself above<i> </i>pop music and its consumers.<span> </span>And unfortunately, much like he did on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9965-the-magic-position/"" target=""_blank"">The Magic Position</a> </i>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13067-the-bachelor/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Bachelor</i></a>, Wolf is operating like someone who doesn't trust his audience to think at his level, offering a subtly condescending record that leaves so little to the listener's imagination that it actually may as well have been called <i>To Love: Patrick Wolf!</i></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">At first glance, Wolf's headfirst dive into new romantic pop seemed like a good move.<span> </span>As with ""Accident &amp; Emergency"" or ""The Magic Position"", Wolf put a good step forward on this album's lead single: ""The City"" remains an insistently kicky piece of kitsch, its cheeseball horn charts and can-do lyrics about love transcending material possession successfully recalling 80s new pop.<span> </span>But like ""The City""'s video-- Wolf frolicking on the Santa Monica pier with a bunch of Hollister ad types-- the rest of <i>Lupercalia </i>is self-aware in all but one crucial aspect, <span> </span>the ability to recognize just how blatantly it allows itself to lay it on so thick.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Far be it from me to deny someone the agency to make his ""happy"" record, but Wolf seems to feel as if self-consciousness grants him a license to go slumming in his most insipid songwriting impulses.<span> </span>The clincher from otherwise charming ""House"": ""This is the greatest peace I've ever known/ Only love makes a house a home.""<span> </span>Meanwhile, the lesson learned on <span> </span>""Together"" is ""and I can't do this alone/ But we can do this so much better together,"" the last word harmonized just so in case you didn't get the gist.<span> </span>Sure, it's awkward when he allows himself a little more poetic license on the string-choked ""Slow Motion"" (""before you I was living in a silverfish kitchen""), but at least it's a <i>new </i>way to make the same point.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">How the album manages to feel so impersonal is weird considering it was inspired by Wolf's recent engagement, but the smug piano narrative of ""Bermondsey Street"" feels stuck somewhere between ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwIe_sjKeAY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Our House</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV1FrqwZyKw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Born This Way</a>"". What's frustrating is that if you strip away the unctuous lyrical gaffes, Wolf gets most everything else right.<span> </span>During <i>Lupercalia's </i>first half, he continues to prove himself a fine craftsman of major-key melodies, and this is his most confident and convicted vocal performance yet.<span> </span><span> </span>But like most of Wolf's records, he eventually gives into sad songs and waltzes as <i>Lupercalia </i>progresses, and studded with the same overproduction tricks of cluttered strings and processed samples, ""The Days"" and ""Slow Motion"" don't offer much in the way of contrast outside of tempo.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Considering how intriguing it is to think about Wolf in the abstract-- undeniably talented and ambitious as he is-- there's no reason he <i>shouldn't </i>be some sort of star. <span> </span>But his claims to originality feel increasingly misplaced-- he's not the only auteur combining glam-rock ambitions with sexually ambiguous theatrics these days, and compared to Of Montreal's confrontational eclecticism, Diamond Rings' nervy confessionals, and Lady Gaga's full-frontal multimedia bombast, the domesticated Wolf of <i>Lupercalia </i>can't help but sound tame.</p></div>"|15492.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15492-lupercalia/|5.3|Ian Cohen

He previously explored advertently lush California sounds on 2006's <i>Sun, Sun, Sun</i>, but on his latest album, <i>Bury Me in My Rings</i>, Sennett has immersed himself in a definitively Golden State of mind. It's not what you think, however: Sennett riffs on Silver Lake ennui and Hollywood plasticity. To properly criticize it, you have to play an active role in it he seems to say.</p>
<p>Indeed, the countrypolitan aspirations of <i>Bury Me </i>often make it sound hollow-- there's a basis in roots music, but it isn't ""rootsy"" by any stretch. Instead, the clean-shaven guitars, pedal steels, and violins (not fiddles) achieve an eerie minimalism. Even when they're all appearing at the same time, they're not overwhelming these songs or offering low-end counterpoint but playing toward Sennett's papery, Elliott Smith-like vocals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sennett's songwriting voice has a nonchalant, conversational tone. The melodies and lyrical sentiments of ""Born to Love You"" come so easily, you figure it just <i>has </i>to be cliché, until some loopy tangents about moon launches and flat-screen TV's suggest that Sennett's in on his own joke. On the whole, there are enough tossed-off thoughts and broken communication to make you feel like an eavesdropper rather than a part of a dialogue. Whether addressing a seemingly doomed relationship on the string-haunted ""Who Are You"" (""You got yourself a good girl/ That's good enough for you"") or possibly former Rilo Kiley drummer Jason Boesel during ""Have You Been Cheated"" (""Is your daddy a hustler?"" ostensibly referring to his solo album, <i>Hustler's Son</i>), there's a resigned lack of judgment, which always sounds empathetic even when it feels completely accusatory.</p>
<p>That sense of resignation can also be a weakness. It wasn't the post-Postal Service production trickery that made <i>Me First</i> the best Rilo Kiley project since <i>The Execution of All Things</i>, but relatively uptempo numbers like ""Go On"" and ""A Time for Emily""-- there's an intriguing inversion in how Sennett's more aggressive music often sounds the most emotionally vulnerable. ""Go For the Throat"" approaches that sort of catharsis, but not much other than a distorted vocal effect on ""When I'm Gone"" will jolt you out of the second half of this record, which spends too much time with its feet up. Curiously, that sort of pointedly L.A. arrested development suits Sennett-- even as he morphs sonically, on <i>Bury Me in My Rings</i> he stays true to detailing a life of bright prospects and a willingness to underachieve.</p></div>"|15405.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15405-bury-me-in-my-rings/|6.0|Ian Cohen

So mused Ryan Lenssen, a founding member of the Most Serene Republic, upon the release of the band's most accomplished record, 2009's <i>...And The Ever Expanding Universe</i>. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Lenssen was 19 when the Most Serene Republic began releasing their take on baroque, kitchen-sink pop, in the process becoming the became the first non-Broken Social Scene-related project to sign to Arts &amp; Crafts. Now they dig back into their vault to remaster and release eight tracks from Thee Oneironauts, a band that Lenssen and two other members of the Republic played in when they were 18. The resulting collection, <i>Pre Serene: Thee Oneironauts</i>, is as gawky as a middle school yearbook photo: It sounds like it was made by teenagers who play immoderate amounts of Zelda, like to write songs about 1980s movies that they think are really awesome, and do not yet feel the artistic need to disguise or complicate either of those artistic impulses. O sweet, guileless youth.</p>
<p><i>Thee Oneironauts </i>shows that even at an age when most would-be musicians are fiddling with distortion pedals and refining their teen angst, current Republic members Lenssen, Adrian Jewett, and Nick Greaves (along with non-Republic-an Emily Hunt) were always in the business of bleeding heart earnestness and ornate compositions. Unfortunately, Thee Oneironauts were unable to unite either of those things in intriguing ways,<i> </i>and this collection of their recordings comes off as skittish, cluttered, and excessively maudlin. ""Today Is the Day"" sounds like the work of a young band equally enamored with the Postal Service and the fact that synths can sometimes sound like rocket ships, while the tone and lyrics of the unreasonably long ""St. Germain"" aim for romantic but miss the mark. We now know that these guys would later develop into better songwriters, but this record doesn't offer much evidence in support.</p>
<p>Still, <i>Thee Oneironauts</i>' most cringeworthy moment, ""Zoltar Speaks"" (yes, it's a song told from the point of view of Tom Hanks' character in <i>Big</i>) serves as a pithy thematic summary: This is a document of the anxieties of growing up. It's full of the sort of details and feelings that few of us sensible grown-ups would commit to tape (the lyrics to ""The Breath"" sound like facts that the band members memorized for their high school history class: ""1896: the first movie shown/ 1912: the Titanic went down""), and there's a certain charm to a document like that. But this one is something that only very loyal fans of the band will be able to appreciate; the rest will probably be left wondering why they took these recordings out of the vault in the first place.</p></div>"|15479.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15479-pre-serene-thee-oneironauts/|4.9|Lindsay Zoladz

Weekly's blog: They called him <a href=""http://blogs.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2011/03/odd_futures_cosmic_cousin_meet.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Odd Future's Cosmic Cousin.""</a> To be clear, Spaceghostpurrp will not make a game-changing appearance on ""Late Night With Jimmy Fallon"", and outside of being another young skate kid fascinated by video games and Satan, he doesn't have much in common with Tyler and company. If a comparison must be drummed-up to sell this very weird, really good, but inarguably niche stuff, let's go with ""Clam Casino's evil druggie drop-out cousin from the South.""</p>
<p>Like last year's <i>NASA: The Mixtape</i>, <i>Blvcklvnd Rvdix 66.6 (1991)</i> is obsessed with the earliest, ugliest Three 6 Mafia releases (particularly <i>Underground, Vol. 1: 1991-1994</i>) and follows that tradition of creepy club music while slyly updating it as well. ""Possessed"", <i>Blvcklvnd</i>'s intro track, is lo-fi Lex Luger that tops the oppressive feeling of all those ""B.M.F.""-style beats, but toys with their pop appeal, thanks to a catchy, simple hook that is screamed like a black metal vocal.</p>
<p>Further separating his style from anything resembling conventional hip-hop, Spaceghostpurrp doesn't care for proper mixing (you might go insane listening to this on headphones) and he piles on video game sound effects and dub reggae-like noises. ""Captain Planet"" is a contemplative bouncing moan, like some lost Oval track; hypnotic synth blasts turn the ridiculously titled ""Suck a Dick For 2011"" and hazy stripper anthem ""Grind on Me"" into something transcendent. By the way, there is lots of stuff like ""Suck a Dick For 2011"" on here, which means Spaceghostpurrp is also very into 90s rap's misogyny (lots of strip club talk and ""bitch"" shouts), so be warned.</p>
<p>The last bunch of tracks climb out of the sizzurp murk and go for a 90s New York rap style. ""Legend of the East Pyramyds"" does moaning soul sample rap better than it has any right to, and then it piles on Halloween sound effects. ODB tribute ""Osiris of the East Pyramids Blackland R.I.P. ODB"" consists of synth tones floating ominously, merging the streetwise paranoia of New York and the verge-of-death doom of Houston. It's one of this year's most haunting songs even though it sounds like a mash-up of underground hip-hop from 15 years ago.</p>
<p>Born in 1991, Spaceghostpurrp's really just another one of those indie bedroom producers approaching the music of his earliest years, pairing it with very of-the-moment sonic decisions, and exposing the ways that once disparate arenas of sound mesh together. <i>Blvcklvnd Rvdix 66.6 (1991)</i> is a mess of Three 6 Mafia-chanting, woozy Wu-Tang loops, DJ Screw wheeze, and <i>Mortal Kombat</i> and <i>Godzilla</i> sound effects, all paired with an off-the-dome rapping style that's equal parts Lil Wayne and Lil B. It's as if James Ferraro <i>Lawnmower Man</i>-ed his way into a rap rarity message board and soundtracked the journey.</p></div>"|15449.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15449-blvcklvnd-rvdix-666-1991/|7.1|Brandon Soderberg

But nothing on the record sounded remotely similar to those references; the jam in question, ""I Will Possess Your Heart"", actually ran a bit over eight minutes, and I don't think anyone mistook Ben Gibbard for Damo Suzuki. Leading up to the band's latest effort, <i>Codes and Keys</i>, the name-dropping returned, when Gibbard <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/ben-gibbard-so-proud-new-death-cab-album"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told SPIN</a> that it was keyboard-heavy and ""not guitar-based,"" citing Brian Eno's <i>Another Green World</i> as a hint of what to expect.</p>
<p>The claims of extended experimentation, though exaggerated, aren't as spurious this time around. <i>Codes and Keys</i> does sound different from the rest of the band's catalog. Soft pitter-pattered beats rustle underneath sparse melodies, while layers of extra instrumentation are placed atop already-busy arrangements. Two songs (the metronomic ""Doors Unlocked and Open"" and the unmoored piano meditation ""Unobstructed Views"") run well over the five-minute mark; swaths of gentle noise surround even the most straightforward cuts. If you come to this record looking for something as directly engaging as ""Cath..."" or ""I Will Follow You Into the Dark"", you're going to walk away empty-handed.</p>
<p>Death Cab still sound like Death Cab, but <i>Codes and Keys</i> is undoubtedly the least ""pop"" record they've made since breaking through to the mainstream with their last indie-situated effort, 2003's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2232-transatlanticism/"" target=""_blank""><i>Transatlanticism</i></a>. So there's new territory for the band explored here, and Walla, along with mixing maestro Alan Moulder, applies a label-money sheen that provides a decent frame for the record's sonic idiosyncrasies. But for a band so identified with exploring feelings and the details of relationships, the record comes off as chilly, diffident, and emotionally distant. The texture-heavy excursions (""Doors Unlocked and Open"", ""Unobstructed Views"", ""St. Peter's Cathedral"") are adrift and without direction, while early singles ""You Are a Tourist"" and ""Underneath the Sycamore"" sound like generic versions of the band from an earlier era.</p>
<p>Indeed, even when the band revisits past glories on <i>Codes and Keys</i>' few highlights, Death Cab weirdly sound like they are imitating themselves. They borrow the baroque Brian Wilson-isms of <i>Narrow Stairs</i>' ""You Can Do Better Than Me"" for ""Portable Television"", copy the upward-moving bridge of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2230-the-photo-album/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Photo Album</i></a>'s ""I Was a Kaleidoscope"" for the same structural change in ""Monday Morning"", and lift the basic structure of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2233-plans/"" target=""_blank""><i>Plans</i></a> opener ""Marching Bands of Manhattan"" for ""Underneath the Sycamore"". Anyone who's spent the last decade following along will get some warm fuzzies from these flashes of familiarity, but they tend to get stale with repeat listens.</p>
<p>The rudderless quality might owe something to the album's sporadic recording process-- eight different studios were employed, and the members of Death Cab rarely sound like they're in the same room together. Most remote of all is Gibbard. His vocals are frequently treated with effects, creating an alienating space that, excepting the moony-eyed closing hymn ""Stay Young, Go Dancing"", robs him of his trademark intimacy. Lyrically, he largely plays it safe, engaging in nonsensical rhymes (""When you scream/ Love you seem"") and sweeping declarative generalizations. Gibbard's evocative narratives and incisive commentary, always overlooked with this band, are mostly missing.</p>
<p>Over the last decade, both Death Cab and the landscape around them have changed considerably; while they've signed to a major label and topped the charts, the sensitive-guy Pac NW indie rock archetype they launched a decade ago has receded from the conversation. Another sound that Gibbard had a hand in introducing, however, still reverberates: the gentle, electronic bedroom-pop that he and producer Jimmy Tamborello made as the Postal Service. Those sounds never really infiltrated Death Cab until now, but <i>Codes and Keys</i> doesn't approach that project's level of emotional engagement. Here, Death Cab sound miles apart from each other and, ultimately, from us.</p></div>"|15482.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15482-codes-and-keys/|5.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

Considering the size and devotion of his cult, coupled with Pearl Jam's ""No, you really shouldn't have"" over-generosity when it comes to releases, it's remarkable he hasn't put out five by now. This makes <i>Ukulele Songs</i> even more of a curiosity: As its title makes clear, the album consists of 16 tracks of Vedder pawing the tiny, four-stringed Hawaiian instrument and warbling love songs. That's it. In a way, it's as clear-cut a proposition as you're going to get these days. You either instantly know you need 35 minutes of this in your life or are already backing slowly away.</p>
<p>The songs themselves date back, in some cases, 10 years or more-- presumably from around the same time Vedder wrote ""Soon Forget"", the two-minute ukulele ditty from <i>Binaural</i>. The rest of the songs occupy that same headspace. They are casual, sweet, and disarmingly unaffected, and you can practically smell the campus green wafting off them. That Vedder is putting <i>Ukulele Songs</i> out during this Big Blowout Year of Pearl Jam (Documentary! Festival! Reissue! Tour!) makes it seem even less of a solo project and more like a a souvenir for longtime Pearl Jam fans. It works best that way.</p>
<p>Indeed, in small doses, <i>Ukulele Songs</i> is lovely. Vedder has always been affecting when he's lovelorn, and here he's more or less curled up in a ball of bewildered hurt. ""As I move myself out of your sight/ I'll be sleeping by myself tonight,"" he croons on ""Sleeping By Myself"". The album's best moments-- ""Sleeping By Myself"", ""Without You"", ""Longing to Belong""-- tap the same quietly wounded melancholy as Paul McCartney's 1971 proto-indie pop masterpiece <i>Ram</i>.</p>
<p>Alas, 34 minutes is a perilously long time for most to to spend  alone with just Eddie Vedder, a ukulele, and his feelings for company. Vedder's precious side has never been his best one (see: <i>No Code</i>'s ""Sometimes""), and <i>Ukulele Songs</i> is so determinedly twee and relentlessly self-effacing that it can feel like watching a grown man attempting to morph into a baby koala before your eyes. By itself, hearing Chan Marshall playing Bernadette Peters to Vedder's Steve Martin for the duet ""Tonight You Belong to Me"" is winning and funny; in the context of a full ukulele album, it is slightly cloying. Vedder has said he wants this record to inspire people to pick up the instrument and sing with their friends, an old-fashioned sentiment impossible not to be charmed by. Like a lot of Vedder's experiments, the spirit is easier to admire than the final product. The ukulele might be a great campfire instrument, but sometimes what works best at the campfire should stay there.</p></div>"|15486.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15486-ukulele-songs/|6.4|Jayson Greene

It's not that the album's charms were particularly subtle, it's that I had no idea where Lone fit in the evolving, chatty conversation that is electronic music. <i>EFT</i>'s influences were certainly clear enough: late-1990s Warp beatniks like Boards of Canada and Plaid; Detroit techno; the lite-rave thrum of 808 State. For the first time in his career, Lone had combined them in a way that seemed both clever and obvious. He wasn't so interested in interacting or responding to his peers, but he wasn't sulking in the corner, either: more like industriously building his own fort in it.</p>
<p><i>Echolocations</i> is a six-song EP that feels very much like an extension of <i>EFT</i>. It's natural that, finally having exacted a sound of his own, he would want to refine it. On the whole <i>Echolocations</i> is quicker and more aggressive than his past work, though I'd hesitate to call it more dance-oriented. Lone used to trade in Dilla-style breakbeats, but his drum programming has grown more complex as his tracks have gained steam. <i>Echolocations</i> features his most detailed, strident work to date. Lone fills an impressive amount of space with his percussion. Far from the sparse, digital grooves that dominate techno, Lone organizes his rhythms into flowing streams of hi-hats and snares, interrupting them only to occasionally release his twirling synths upward.</p>
<p>Lone has always had a way with keyboard melodies-- it's the Warp influence-- and <i>Echolocations</i> sounds busy, as if his superior drums are trying to ring his superior synths, and vice-versa. The opening track, ""Coreshine Voodoo"" is like watching two cats fight: lots of tussling with no one looking to deliver the killer blow. He smartly contrasts this with leaning, pulsing organ sounds that function more as stabilizing forces than melodic ones.</p>
<p><i>Echolocations </i>doesn't have the breadth of <i>Emerald Fantasy Tracks</i>, but it's probably not supposed to. It plays like an annex to that album, offering a slight, specific variant. But the strength of <i>Echolocations</i> isn't that it offers variety, just that it offers more. <i>EFT</i> was a coming-of-age, and <i>Echolocations </i>is proof that Lone is crafty enough to build upon it without abandoning his new-found identity.</p></div>"|15488.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15488-echolocations-ep/|7.0|Andrew Gaerig

Much of the material spanned several decades of recordings culled from the tape archives of band leader Doueh (also known as Salmou Baamar). His disregard for time and trajectory was mirrored in the chopping up of styles from different eras that the band cultivated in their home in Dakhla. Doueh's childhood worship of Jimi Hendrix and James Brown could be keenly felt, but so could traditional forms of Saharoui and Gnawa music. Group Doueh is a family affair, with Doueh employing his wife Halima on vocals, and his sons El Waar (organ/keyboards) and Hamdan (drums). Doueh himself alternates between a three-stringed lute called a tinidit and an electric guitar. Like the prior <i>Beatte Harab</i>, this album was recorded by Sublime Frequencies' Hisham Mayet, who dampened the band's earlier lo-fi recording techniques while maintaining the raw heart of the Group Doueh sound.</p>
<p>There has been some notable sonic evolution since <i>Beatte Harab</i>. The tinny percussion of that album is replaced by more boisterous playing from Hamdan, and Doueh is prone to more regularly swapping out the tinidit for his electric guitar. In short, the rock and pop melodies that have always been present are given greater clarity, although <i>Zayna Jumma</i> still rests firmly within that pan-global mash-up of cultures they've ingeniously threaded together. It begins in a place of abstract euphoria, through the casually faltering rhythms of the title track. At times it feels like the tinidit is falling out of sync with Hamdan's beat, but that slackness in the playing functions as the root of the song's slow-build arc into abandon and elation. By the end of the track, Halima and her co-singers are shouting the words as they get all caught up in that frenzied spot they've been teased into by the increasingly maniacal playing.</p>
<p>That steady shift into vocal exultation is a common event on Group Doueh recordings, but they also know how to temper those urges, putting the brakes on at just the right time on restrained tracks like ""Met-Ha"" and ""Aziza"". Doueh breaks out some chunky wah-wah guitar to ease in ""Ishadlak Ya Khey"", which might be their most ""rock"" recording to date. But it retains vital components of the band's sound, such as the looseness in the playing that droops at just the right weight between the players. It's a credit to Mayet's work that he made these recordings sound as ""live"" as possible-- on ""Zaya Koum"" it feels like you're sitting in on a cozy session in Dakhla, where Doueh is happy to noodle his way into guitar oblivion while his family works around him. Similarly, on the sputtering ""Jagwar Doueh"", the vocal lines feel like wild one-off improvisations that would have taken on vastly different forms had they been recorded in another time and place.</p>
<p>Repetition is a key trait in the Group Doueh sound, and they use it wisely throughout this record. Often it will be a thudding beat that cycles tirelessly in place, allowing Doueh to layer his flanged and wah-ed guitar over the top. At other times, such as on the closing ""Wazan Doueh"", a stringed instrument of some type will loop over and over to form the rhythmic hook. That track is the most trance-like piece here, and its airy delivery demonstrates the band's remarkable versatility. The lightness of touch forms a neat contrast to the raucous close in the opening ""Zayna Jumma"". Doueh seems like a humble man, who'll continue to run his cassette store and work in Group Doueh's primary outlet as a wedding band regardless of the focus afforded to this album. In fact, he resisted all attempts to release his music until Mayet trekked across a large part of northwest Africa to meet him after hearing a few of his songs on the radio. Thankfully that mixture of modesty and reticence didn't endure, because <i>Zayna Jumma</i> is a densely layered piece of cultural cross-pollination that consistently spills over into outright joy.</p></div>"|15461.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15461-zayna-jumma/|7.6|Nick Neyland

Baldly she admits, ""Nothing  Bachelorette makes ever sounds the way I'd like it to,"" and despite  cherishing ""the number of believers in the independent music scene,""  Alpers concludes, ""I'd rather watch the others enjoy themselves/ And  just be happy that I'm not a part of it.""</p>
<p>The  song may reflect a struggle on Alpers' part to find motivation and  meaning in Bachelorette, and her new album itself often seems to  suggest a low-burning flame. As with past Bachelorette ventures,  Alpers layers her vocals in all sorts of pretty but unemotional ways to  present brainy lyrics atop artily mannered synth tones, grooves, and  loops. Her work has an appealing intellectualism, but Alpers often fails  to locate the human connection that makes other artists of her ilk  great. Her style owes something to Laurie Anderson, but Alpers lacks  Anderson's humor. Meanwhile, Stereolab is no less arch, yet they've also  made fun, massively grooving pop music. Even contemporary artists who  are plying a similar approach, like Sufjan Stevens, Max Tundra, and St.  Vincent, find means through hooks or noise or pure emotional  expression to make a palpable communion with their audience.</p>
<p>If  you're willing to fully take Alpers on her own terms, however, there's  value in Bachelorette. Specifically, there are a few songs here with  lovely vocal melodies and harmonies, namely the stirring, hymn-like ""The  Light Seekers"", the utterly gorgeous ""Sugarbug"", and the trilling ""Tui  Tui"". You can't help but think that if Alpers lavished more attention on  pure sound she wouldn't be far off from producing something similar to  Julianna Barwick's <i>The Magic Place</i>. But her sonic backdrops  never quite take hold, and modestly buzzy, bloopy tracks like ""Blanket"",  ""Polarity Party"", and ""Digital Brain"" only barely compel interest.  Meanwhile, Alpers' lyrics are almost uniformly delivered without  emphasis and often are wholly indecipherable.</p>
<p>Even though wordy,  tech-obsessed Alpers leans too heavily at times on 10-cent  verbiage, occasionally a meaningful or moving phrase will poke through,  like her confession on ""Blanket"" that ""The only way to see you is  through the hole in my chest."" Otherwise, lyrical opacity is just  another way in which Bachelorette tends to keep you at arm's length. If  Alpers' unease on ""Not Entertainment"" reflects a desire for a change, here's hoping she'll pursue avenues that better  take advantage of her gifts.</p></div>"|15477.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15477-bachelorette/|5.8|Joshua Love

Back in 1999, when the band released its debut LP, <i>The Tennessee Fire</i> (and again in 2001, after the release of <i>At Dawn</i>), its legend was whispered quietly, like a ghost story: Kentucky, grain silos, reverb, that high, liquid voice. As 2001 was the apex of a certain kind of dark, New York City cool-- with the Strokes and Interpol slouching around the Lower East Side in threadbare t-shirts and tiny ties-- My Morning Jacket were steeped in a warm, eerie other-ness that culminated, cathartically, with Jim James howling ""All your life/ Is obscene."" Well, sure.</p>
<p>In the ensuing decade, the band became legendary for its heroic live show (in 2008, they stormed through a near-four-hour set at Bonnaroo), but its studio work has always been a little less triumphant. On record, My Morning Jacket can sometimes sound like a band struggling against its own best interests, purposefully eschewing the exact thing-- huge, ghostly, terrifying rock'n'roll-- it does so disarmingly well. Accordingly, the reigning press narrative surrounding <i>Circuital</i>, MMJ's sixth LP, has been focused on the band's supposed ""return to form,"" a response that feels like a direct reaction to its title (or, more likely, to 2008's falsetto-addled <i>Evil Urges</i>, easily the band's most divisive record).</p>
<p>But what are they returning to, exactly? My Morning Jacket’s early discography is rooted in oddball experimentation: Despite the open-mouthed riffing, impenetrable reverb, and whipping hair, they’ve never really been a straightforward rock band, especially on record. Jim James' penchant for psychedelic soul is constantly manifesting in new ways, and while <i>Circuital</i> is closer, certainly, to 2005's <i>Z</i> than <i>Evil Urges</i>, it doesn’t feel like a step backwards, or even like a lateral hop.</p>
<p>The record opens with James tooting a half-serious introductory ""horn"" riff that belies a goofy sense of humor. James has always been something of a jokester (cue the whispered ""Shaaa!"" at the end of ""Circuital"" or the line, ""They told me not to smoke drugs, but I wouldn't listen/ Never thought I'd get caught and wind up in prison,"" from ""Outta My System""), but his voice is so naturally dramatic that even silly bits can sound like earnest proclamations. That's why-- and this is unique to MMJ-- he often sounds best when he's delivering vague platitudes.</p>
<p>Still, anyone who's ever heard James wail in concert is likely to be frustrated by the eternal underuse of his voice in the studio, even when the songs were ostensibly recorded live. There are a few tracks here where producer Tucker Martine captures it in all its intoxicating splendor-- the acoustic lament ""Wonderful (The Way I Feel)"" especially-- but most only hint at what James is capable of delivering in person.  His falsetto (contentious since the days of ""Highly Suspicious"") comes back for ""Holdin on to Black Metal"", a bizarre bit of jam-funk that alternates between pleasantly spirited and genuinely stupid (it's a cautionary tale about not growing out of black metal fandom, and ends with a shout of ""Let's rock!""). On ""Slow Slow Tune"", James sounds remarkably vulnerable, singing to his future progeny over a barely there, bubblegum guitar figure that recalls the Everly Brothers before transitioning into a Flaming Lips-style burnout.</p>
<p>Like nearly all of their studio albums, <i>Circuital</i> may not reach the heights of the band's live show-- a good MMJ concert can recalibrate your gut, it can change you-- but it’s a remarkably solid step for a band that's never stopped evolving.</p></div>"|15471.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15471-circuital/|7.2|Amanda Petrusich

After the feverish debate that quickly ensued in the UK music press, such talk has come to sound like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Among the Vaccines' detractors, meanwhile, hardly a review deadline goes by without some pun on the quartet's debut album title, <i>What Did You Expect From the Vaccines?</i></p>
<p>The Vaccines, much to their credit, are savvier about expectations than their champions and critics alike. Led by singer Justin Young, who previously played indie-folk under the name Jay Jay Pistolet, and guitarist Freddie Cowan, whose older brother is in the Horrors, these guys know firsthand how hype can be a double-edged sword-- one that has already propelled their meat-and-potatoes pub rock near the top of the UK album charts, to uncertain impact on their long-term reputations. The real joke of the album title, after all, is that it raises the same question the band posed of ""Post Break-Up Sex"" on their bombastic, pleasant-enough second single.</p>
<p>The answer, on that song, is that we should expect a chance to forget our past loves for a little while, followed by a sense of overwhelming guilt. For better or worse, there's nothing here that warrants either such reaction, let alone the paroxysms of hyperbole going on in the British press. Sure, the band's buzzing guitars, thick reverb, and bouncy rhythms lack any particular spark of originality that might help listeners avoid compulsively thinking of names like Ramones, the Jesus and Mary Chain, or, yes, the Strokes. Then again, there's no shame in catchy, concise, sharply executed tunes that communicate mildly fresh takes on relationships, either-- and this album has more than a few.</p>
<p>The Vaccines are at their best when they're upbeat, flecked with surf, and surprisingly hard to get out of your head. Take ""If You Wanna"", which bops likably along like a somewhat higher-fidelity Best Coast as Young warbles about an ex he'd take back in a second, or ""Nørgaard"", a playfully loutish ode to a Danish model. But there's also ""Blow It Up"", which borrows from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22i+should+have+known+better%22+beatles&amp;aq=f"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Beatles' ""I Should Have Known Better""</a> a little too blatantly to enjoy in its own right. ""Under Your Thumb"", for its part, appears to take critic Ellen Willis's <a href=""http://funboring.com/WillisTest"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">argument</a> that <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?q=%22under+my+thumb%22+%22rolling+stones%22"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Rolling Stones' similarly titled tirade</a> actually <i>isn't</i> sexist as a challenge to write a song about a man completely submitting to his (presumably, female-- name's Eleanor, anyway) lover.</p>
<p>It's easy enough to imagine the Vaccines' slower songs going over well with an outdoor crowd drunk on sun and beer. Previous <i>NME</i> favorites Glasvegas already have the ""swooning anthems with girl-group beats"" thing pretty much covered, but the Vaccines do it here twice: over droning organ on ""Wetsuit"", which again recalls the U.S. beach-pop crowd, and then another time on the dreary ""All in White"", which occupies much the same U2-echoing expanse as lesser bands the Temper Trap or White Lies. The most awkward moment is slo-mo finale ""Family Friend"", which builds to an embarrassingly neutered wall-of-noise crescendo. In a final possible reference to Best Coast, Wavves, and their stoned sunshine set, Young wonders aloud if everybody <i>really</i> feels ""as high as a kite"": ""Well, I don't really know if they do, but they might.""

It's no stretch to imagine that Megafaun multitasker Phil Cook's immersion in this venerable material shaped the deep-rooted simplicity of his solo debut.</p>
<p>During the <i>Sounds of the South</i> premiere, I was especially enamored of Cook's sensitivity as an instrumentalist. On the piano, he had a gracefully leaping sense of melody, and on the banjo, he played clusters of sweet harmonics in places where a less humble musician might have soloed hard. This tasteful and generous temper suffuses <i>Hungry Mother Blues</i>, a collection of instrumental folk compositions mostly for acoustic guitar, banjo, and growling resonator; perhaps a dash of harmonica for color. Cook's Feat are actually just his feet, lightly whomping on a homemade stompbox. He's alone and yet not, conversing with a pantheon of American innovators who favor expressivity over flash: people such as slide guitarist <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5TKrA9opxc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ry Cooder</a>, the fingerstyle guitarist <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ_ay0p2_vo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Fahey</a>, and the shapeshifting <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Svzv-YkUzdk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bill Frisell</a>.</p>
<p>The album opens with the welcoming breeze of ""Frazee, Minnesota"", whose lead melody strongly resembles the vocal part of Arthur Russell's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI5xmX4T52c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Maybe She</a>"". While almost certainly coincidental, it gives you an idea of how melodically lucid Cook's writing is. The fluent ""Juniper"" is just as eminently hummable, to an almost crazy degree for instrumental music. These are simple, bucolic themes, brought to life with a deft assortment of bends, slides, and evolving transpositions. Offsetting the earworms are groove-and-atmosphere focused tracks such as the gently galloping, clawhammer banjo tune ""Waiting 'Round the Oven Buns"" and the Cooder-esque ""<a href=""http://philcookandhisfeat.bandcamp.com/album/hungry-mother-blues"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ballad of a Hungry Mother</a>"". Overall, it's a great chance to hear the subtle and relaxed touch Cook brings to Megafaun unadorned, save for the barest four-on-the-floor beats here and there.</p>
<p>Still, let's be clear: This is not a Megafaun record. There are no freak-outs or electronic interventions or field recordings. It's eight casual-feeling songs in just under 20 minutes, though it's quite diverse within those narrow confines, flowing easily from the moony blues of ""Sparrowander"" to the cockier swagger of ""The Last Steam Engine Train"". <i>Hungry Mother Blues </i>shows us some of the basic underpinnings beneath Megafaun's gritty inventions, reminding us that if you want to make something really new, it helps to be deeply coversant with the old.</p></div>"|15442.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15442-hungry-mother-blues/|7.5|Brian Howe

Even his first album with  <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/122-arab-strap/"">Arab Strap</a>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14566-the-week-never-starts-round-here-deluxe-edition-philophobia-deluxe-edition/"">The Week Never Starts Round Here</a></i>, felt drawn from an acerbic place in someone with a few more creases in their brow. Moffat was in his early twenties around then, and has since made a career by siphoning his unseemly soliloquies into song. The aging process has often been on his mind throughout; the opening verse from ""The Night Before the Funeral"" from Arab Strap's 1998 record <i>Philophobia</i> reads: ""Too drunk and getting old."" Now he's teamed up with a fellow veteran of the Scottish music world, multi-instrumentalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/21559-bill-wells/"">Bill Wells</a>, to really hammer that point home by titling this record <i>Everything's Getting Older</i>. The duo may have sprouted a few new gray hairs during its making, as the album took some eight years of sporadic recording to reach completion.</p>
<p>Much of this record documents Moffat's attempts to reconcile his past and present lives. ""Let's Stop Here"" sets the tone by having him fend off the advances of a former object of his desire, principally due to the fact that he's settled down. But Moffat is happy to show off his fallibility, noting that a younger version of himself is still ticking away inside somewhere, possibly anguishing over his actions as he utters the title of the song. Wells demonstrates his versatility throughout-- ""Let's Stop Here"" is all somber, violin-driven balladry, while the following ""Cages"" is propelled by urgent piano stabs. The latter acutely captures Moffat's current mindset, with reminisces of his lifestyle from Arab Strap's ""The First Big Weekend"" coupled with words on the wretched mundanity of his present existence. Even Moffat's beloved watering holes are aging-- ""the pub's once brilliant copper roof has oxidized over the years and now it's a dull, pastel green,"" he muses in ""The Copper Top"".</p>
<p>So Moffat is pretty much where you'd expect him to be as he settles into his late thirties, plagued by innumerable doubts and insecurities. Where <i>Everything's Getting Older </i>loses focus is in the desire of the two players to constantly canter through great stylistic shifts. Perhaps that's not surprising considering the long gestation period of this material. It's been patched together over vast stretches of time, and it shows. Moffat sounds like he's struggling to find his place in the disjointed rhythms of ""A Short Song to the Moon"" and the lite-funk riffing of ""Glasgow Jubilee"". It's when the pair keeps it simple that they stumble upon a space in which they can operate effectively. The basic piano backing of ""Ballad of the Bastard"" and ""The Copper Top"" afford Moffat plenty of room to sink into his particular brand of lyrical discomfort, helping both tracks to become wonderfully drab centerpieces to the album.</p>
<p>After those peaks this sags into a marginal piece from both players. The lost spy-thriller theme ""Dinner Time"" and the stripped-down ""The Sadness in Your Life Will Slowly Fade"" are Moffat on autopilot, straining for insight. In the latter he circles back to the album's predominant theme, recalling another night out that made him feel old. But 10 songs into the record, we've now already got the point. Perhaps that's the idea, with Moffat keen to cast himself as an aging bellyacher slumped over the bar, recalling his youth and cursing his advancing years until someone hears him out. It's easy to romanticize such a figure after a one-off encounter, but here it feels like you're being forced to spend time with him on a daily basis. Fortunately Moffat is able to move beyond that with the last two tracks, which find him looking to the future as a father, albeit one with an inclination toward creepy lullabies in ""And So Must We Rest"". It's just a shame he could only chance upon scattered moments of inspiration while coming to uneasy terms with aging elsewhere on <i>Everything</i>'<i>s Getting Older</i>.</p></div>"|15454.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15454-everythings-getting-older/|6.4|Nick Neyland

On their 2003 full-length, <i>Tulsa For One Second</i>, the Chicago-based group-- which bills itself as a multimedia arts-collective, instead of a rock band-- made glitch-pop. They used laptop computers to marry somber melodies to knock-and-bump rhythms wrought from abstract electronic noise.</p>
<p>Nowadays, they're a little more interested in the past. On <i>Charade Is Gold</i>, Pulseprogramming-- now staffed by singer/composer Marc Hellner and vocalist Chanel Pease-- have swapped software for hardware, ditching their laptops for old-school drum machines and MIDI cables. Nearly a decade down the road from their last release, the band has chosen to head backwards in time, delivering a record heavily informed by the electronic music of the 1980s.</p>
<p>With its rattling lo-bit snares and lush synth-strings, album opener ""Perfect Problematic"" sounds like it leapt straight out of the decade of Swatch watches and sweatbands, even if the lyrics are a tad dour. ""It's easier to fall apart than to heal/ To suffer the ache of age with nothing left to feel,"" sings Hellner. It sounds like OMD jamming with Ian Curtis after a week of overcast days. Ultimately, it's the sounds of synth-pop Pulseprogramming are interested in-- the woozy new-age chords, the twinkling analog arpeggios-- and not the genre's sunshiny sentiments. As a frontman, Hellner shies away from the soul music-informed delivery favored by his new romantic forebears. Instead he keeps his emotions pitched down and focused, for the most part, on disconnection, disappointment, and acceptance. ""Even though we wait patiently, the truth is, we live with what we get,"" he sings on ""So Right Words Strike Me"", his words frozen in a snowdrift of digital strings.</p>
<p>Pulseprogramming's synth-pop ideal is dystopian, rather than utopian-- more Gary Numan than the Human League. Pease and Hellner use the stiff and gridded rhythms of primitive electronics to evoke the endless repetition of workaday life. For groups like Washed Out and Toro y Moi, who are also mining Reagan-era sounds, the past-- as evoked through swoony synths and Roland rhythm boxes-- is a place of bliss and innocence. On <i>Charade Is Gold</i>, Pulseprogramming's take is more moody. They've been around longer and, perhaps, have a clearer memory of the decade's dark side.</p></div>"|15483.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15483-charade-is-gold/|6.8|Aaron Leitko

They didn't, and this release, originally on cassette and now re-mastered and re-issued digitally and on vinyl, was born. Largely comprised of little more than single-or-double tracked acoustic guitar and Bejar's vocals, the sound of <i>Ideas For Songs</i> isn't so much lo-fi as low-rent. The occasional adornment-- wheezy keyboards, a bit of lead guitar-- lends the set a certain amateurishness, but Bejar's vocals aren't shy in the mix, and there's a clarity to every sound, however shambolic their arrangement. Though there are fewer chords and leaps between sections than, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8970-destroyers-rubies/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rubies</i></a>, you can hear the shuffling grandiosity of some of Bejar's better-realized later compositions coming together here.</p>
<p>Despite a few hints of Bejar's rickety indie-rock idols, his early music still feels somewhat unprecedented, due largely to his emergent vocal style. Even on these early recordings, his distinctive, sometimes divisive rasp carries much of its current impact, and, as on the spacious <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15034-kaputt/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kaputt</i></a>, it's especially striking over this stripped-down setting.

<p>The set begins with a classic Bejar turnaround; over descending strums, he describes ""a boring nation at war with itself, but not really at war with itself"" and ""a giant among smaller giants."" His fondness for the disarming images and direct address is all over <i>Ideas</i>; there's the ""afterbirth too red to mention"" in ""Forget America"", and he closes ""Songs About a Girl Up to a Point"" with the bracing ""my dear, fuck you and fuck August."" Now as then, these sharply rendered left-field ruminations are the things Destroyer songs are made of, and <i>Ideas</i> is often withering, full of keenly observed, uniquely Bejarian takedowns. It has more than a few references that seem to find Bejar grappling with getting his lyrical ideas into the music; ""I couldn't find the words and then I found the words,"" he repeats throughout the unusually catchy ""Untitled"", and the grammar-policing ""Marrying the Hammer"" ends with a bit about the ""divorcing the chords to marry the hammer."" As inscrutable as Bejar's words can seem, it seems pretty clear that he's talking process here, about getting the two halves-- the ideas and the songs themselves-- to agree with one another. Matched up to <i>Ideas</i>' threadbare arrangements, his knotty lyrics untangle more easily.</p>
<p><i>Ideas</i>' best tune is probably its last, ""Why Banacek Doesn't Love"", which moves calmly and confidently back and forth between verse and chorus. Its refrain-- ""I'm seceding from a love I don't believe of""-- is his strongest to that point. But the key lines on ""Banacek"" come earlier, when Bejar sings of ""a string of broken entries"" and castigates someone for ""quoting and stealing and quoting"" and so on. Bejar naysayers often go after his overly allusive lyrics and his too-reverent genre dabbling, but here, while still carving out a musical identity of his own, he digs into himself, operating almost outside of influence, laying much of the groundwork for what would become his inimitable style. <i>Ideas For Songs</i> may be a glorified demo, but rarely do early sketches feel this well-rendered, and however unintended its release as a full-length, this is a vital document in Destroyer's development. Next to later compositional triumphs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14141-city-of-daughters-thief-streethawk-a-seduction/"" target=""_blank""><i>Streethawk: A Seduction</i></a> or <i>Kaputt</i>, the musical side of these <i>Ideas For Songs</i> may leave a little to be desired. But Destroyer has long been about getting as many smart, startling lines into the music as possible, and all that starts here.</p></div>"|15484.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15484-ideas-for-songs/|7.1|Paul Thompson

It's probably a gross oversimplification to call Mwamwaya a <i>happy</i> singer, but there's a sense of pure liquid joy in almost every one of his vocal performances; you can practically hear his grin through the microphone, and that level of giddy enthusiasm is about as infectious as it gets. On the group's 2008 debut mixtape, <i>Esau Mwamwaya and Radioclit Are the Very Best</i>, the European DJ duo Radioclit threw all sorts of pan-global dance and pop tracks at Mwamwaya, and he elevated nearly every one of them with that keening, high-pitched wail. You could do plenty of cultural-studies theorizing about all the levels of appropriation at work in that first mixtape-- white DJs snatching Vampire Weekend's quasi-African indie pop and refashioning it for an African singer. But actually listening to the final product, all that was beside the point. This wasn't a mental exercise; it was a joyously physical full-length, a gifted singer sliding across the pop landscape with a border-transcending glee.</p>
<p>The Very Best followed that mixtape up with a triumphant debut album, 2009's <i>Warm Heart of Africa</i>, and now they're back with another free mixtape, one released to the Internet on Mother's Day after little more than a week of notice. But things within the group are different now. They've spent nearly three solid years on the road and in the studio, and now they're down to a duo; Radioclit has broken up, and one of those Euro DJs, Etienne Tron, is off to focus on other projects. It's tough to say what effect those new circumstances had on the group, but the new <i>Super Mom</i> is a markedly different piece of work from that first mixtape. The group's debut thrived in part on its sense of momentum; it let up only when it reached the suite of dizzily gorgeous ballads at the end. But even though <i>Super Mom</i> has more than its share of huge, swooping choruses and amped-up utilitarian dance beats, it's more of a trudge than its predecessor, and the tracks haven't been chosen with the same near-perfect sense of velocity and timing.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the group's version of Kanye West's ""Runaway"", which comes only five tracks into <i>Super Mom</i>. ""Runaway"" is a great song and all, but here it's a total momentum killer, more than six minutes of midtempo millionaire self-pity in the middle of what had been a dance party. Remaining producer Johan Hugo leaves the track almost untouched, letting Kanye and Pusha T deliver their verses in full and limiting Mwamwaya to intro and outro appearances and mid-verse ad-libs. It's a ballsy attempt at a hijacking, but Mwamwaya sounds awkwardly shoehorned into a song-- the sort of song that simply can't accommodate him.</p>
<p>When Mwamwaya and Hugo are fully locked-in, there's still plenty of the sunburst happiness of that first album and EP, and putting Mwamwaya over a refashioned version of Tom Petty's ""Don't Come Around Here No More"" was an inspired choice. But more often than not, Hugo leaves giant chunks of the original songs intact, and nobody needs to hear Billy Idol's ""Eyes Without a Face"" when Mwamwaya only halfway gets to take it over. Another issue: An absolute horde of guest vocalists appears on the tape, few of them displaying anything like Mwamwaya's verve. It's a lot of fun to hear Mwamwaya alongside Senegalese legend Baaba Maal on ""Miracle"", but he barely gets a word in edgewise amid all the rappers, singers, and chanters on the jackhammer dance track ""Secousse"". Mwamwaya's voice is clearly the greatest thing the Very Best have going for them, and it's a bit weird to hear all these other people crowding him out.</p>
<p>Of course,<i> Super Mom</i> is more of a quickie release than a fleshed-out artistic statement, and it's easy to imagine time constraints causing its relative thinness. The two entirely original tracks on the mixtape go a long way toward proving the duo still has gas left in its tank. The tape-opening title track shows everything anyone ever loved about the group in the first place, Mwamwaya airily belting over absurdly catchy, melodically fluid synth riffs. And the even more propulsive ""Ndekha"" builds up for two and a half minutes before the beat fully kicks in; when the hammer finally drops, it's glorious. <i>Super Mom</i> doesn't showcase the group at its best throughout. But as long as they're still capable of magic moments like these, they'll be impossible to write off.</p></div>"|15464.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15464-super-mom/|6.7|Tom Breihan

Charles Speer, a veteran of New York's No-Neck Blues Band, there's not much difference between the honkytonks of the American South and the tekedes of early 20th century Greece. They may be geographically and culturally divergent, but both are centered around drugs-- alcohol and pot in honkytonks, hashish in tekedes-- and both are associated with very specific musical traditions. Speer explores these two worlds on his two new albums, revealing a common guiding principle: namely, a disdain for hard song structures in favor of inquisitive spontaneity.</p>
<p>The primarily instrumental <i>Arghiledes</i> is a solo record in every sense: Speer played and overdubbed all the instruments, treated the sounds, and produced the record. He alternates between bouzouki and baglamas, then adds percussion, organ, and occasionally electric guitar to create spiraling drones. ""Tsamiko Hijaz"" features some spellbinding percussion, and in one of the more productive avenues, ""The Heavy Heart of Ando-Yeap"" melds those traditional Greek ideas with psychedelic-rock sounds. The album works best when Speer lets these musical ideas play out patiently, but it stumbles whenever he adds vocals. The guttural chanting on ""Harmanis"" is more cartoonish than narcotic, and at times Speer grunts and huffs-- presumably in English-- like Tom Waits, creating a commotion that distracts from graceful filigrees of acoustic guitar. <i>Arghiledes</i> sounds oddly aloof and self-indulgent, as though alienation were Speer's goal. If so, he achieves it too often.</p>
<p><i>Leaving the Commonwealth</i> is warmer in its appropriation of outlaw country, although it's a similarly academic endeavor. Speer buys into the whole redneck-hippie ethos that catapulted country music into the mainstream during the 1970s; Willie Nelson is to this record what bouzouki master Markos Vamvakaris is to <i>Arghiledes</i>. So many years later, however, it's just as impossible to recapture that sound and especially that sensibility as it is to evoke the smoky atmosphere of the tekedes, which makes <i>Leaving the Commonwealth</i> sound a bit too self-aware, even kitschy at times. When Speer begins talking his way through the end of ""Cumberland"" and describing a stock Southern eccentric character, he sounds more redneck-hipster than redneck-hippie.</p>
<p>Although he hews a bit too closely to country's stock themes, Speer's songwriting can be surprisingly adventurous and spry, and his deep, granular voice is ideally suited to the honkytonk. And whenever <i>Leaving the Commonwealth</i> begins to lag, the Helix pick it up and keep it moving, like any good bar band should. Hans Chew's piano sounds like a gremlin in the works, constantly taunting the frontman, while Steven McGuirl's drums keep everything moving at a quick clip. The Helix proves as diverse as it is agile, moving from the straightforward honkytonk opener ""Razorbacked"" to the zydeco-inflected ""Le Grand Cochon"" to the more psychedelic moments on ""Freddie's Lapels"". The closing title track is a dense, sharp-cornered guitar jam that, much like ""Ando-Yeap"" on <i>Arghiledes</i>, takes the album in a completely new direction right before it ends. Both are intriguing, even exciting finales, which suggest that Speer is at his best when he's working not within specific historical frameworks, but between them.</p></div>"|15444.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15444-arghiledes-leaving-the-commonwealth/|5.7|Stephen M.

That's their real family name. Though they were born, seven years apart, in the small, Northern English county of Tyne and Wear, they now call Northumberland home. They sing in a regional dialect and with regional accents, and they also organize residential ""singing weekends"" through their website, traditional holidays that include ""singarounds and workshops, short coastal walks, singing in the pub and food to write home about."" They're serious about singing.</p>
<p>There is much cultural reference, mystery, and beauty to be found on <i>Last</i>, a lot of which can't be untangled by Google. The opening ""Gan to the Kye"" is a beautiful example, a piano-based standard about a plot, cattle, and a dead collie in the fields. Its titular refrain is a reference to an old plural word for ""cows."" Equally heart-breaking is ""The Gallowgate Lad"", a flowing, six-minute tale of a wayward militia man, sung from the perspective of a concerned lover. And then there's the seven-minute ""Close the Coalhouse Door"", a song whose slurry of fiddle and piano adds an ethereal sheet of light (""Close the coal house door, lad/ There's bones inside"") to the darkness of the industrial tragedy at its center. It's an unforgettable vocal performance, and while parts of <i>Last</i> can feel so rooted in tradition that it takes on a museum piece feel, ""Close the Coalhouse Door"" is theirs alone. Here they seem less about purism and more about their own impressions.</p>
<p>When they dip into jazzier fare in ""Give Away Your Heart"" or offer a string-laced cover of Tom Waits' ""No One Knows I'm Gone"", <i>Last</i> verges on the staunchly traditional, but their singing takes the music somewhere else. And it has to, since both the instrumentation and the arrangements are stately and simple-- there's not much besides trumpet, piano, autoharp, fiddle, and strings. Rachel possesses a voice that's smooth and unfailing, while her younger sister Becky's has much more grain to it. The revolving harmonies of ""Canny Hobbie Elliot"" are emblematic of how well they can work together. Though it's one of the few songs on <i>Last</i> that isn't sad and bleak, their voices come together just so, and the result is mystifying and devastating.</p></div>"|15485.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15485-last/|7.6|David Bevan

It's a term that implies unfulfilled potential. But now that his latest album, <i>Simple Math</i>, aspires to be a culmination of his prior two bombastically titled and performed LPs, I can revisit them knowing they were fully conceived steps towards the logical endpoint, ""a story about a 23-year old who questions everything from marriage to love to religion to sex."" In other words, a concept album about the experience of being Andy Hull, written by Andy Hull.</p>
<p>But hell, if there's any Conor Oberst acolyte capable of making <i>The Merrimack</i> to Titus Andronicus' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14010-the-monitor/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Monitor</i></a>, it's Hull. As a frontman, he does his peers proud-- while his astringent, high lonesome warble immediately recalls the Jim James/Ben Bridwell dialect, it's flexible enough to handle both rebel yells and vulnerable self-flagellation. Hull's got a thing for drunken fuck-ups who own up to their failures, though he's far more interested in using it for autobiography rather than storytelling. His belief in his own profundity is kind of endearing as Manchester Orchestra's driving force. It's hard to imagine something like the title track, which uses infidelity as a jumping-off point to question the entire basis of human existence, even standing a chance without it.</p>
<p>The problem lies in where Hull ends and Manchester Orchestra begins, and it's a space populated by lesser sons of the south, post-grunge good ol' boys like 3 Doors Down and Collective Soul-- tellingly, the most immediately hooky riffs of the lot (""April Fool"") lay mere inches down the fretboard from those of ""Shine"", and ""Leave It Alone"" flirts too briefly with a raw tenderness before diving headfirst into the sugary dross of truck-selling power ballad ""The World That I Know"".</p>
<p>It's that ponderous alt-rock framework that makes <i>Simple Math </i>such a drag even as the lyrics and production feel like they're racing to out-sensationalize each other. While the burly guitars on ""Mighty"" and ""Pale Black Eye"" flex some swamp-rock muscle, as a full outfit, Manchester Orchestra simply plod instead of groove, bogged down by <i>Simple Math</i>'s favorite artificial flavor, a charmlessly and coldly recorded string section. It's indicative of <i>Simple Math</i>'s overcooking: Most of the time, the band can't find a moment of empty space it doesn't fill with that extra guitar overdub, more string cues, or another intimacy-sapping vocal harmony. Or you get something like ""Pensacola"", whose stein-swinging coda comes off like a fun idea they were dying to get in <i>somewhere</i> rather than an organic conclusion, to say nothing of its clear resemblance to a Modest Mouse song that happens to be called ""Florida"".</p>
<p>And then there's ""Virgin"". It clearly announces itself as <i>Simple Math</i>'s ""ambitious centerpiece"" by going all in on the epic signifiers: daunting strings, a horn section at the bridge, massed vocals, and, of course, a kiddie choir to drive the hook home. But melodically and tonally, they're simply piling onto what, at its core, is an incredibly simple arrangement-- its juddering, drop-D Alice in Chains riff is too repetitive <i>not </i>to be catchy, but taken as a whole, it's the most glaring example of a record that's too quick to cut corners and cheat its way toward unhinged transcendence despite so convincingly having its shit together. Which ultimately is where <i>Simple Math </i>falters despite its admirable ambition; as the saying goes, ""men plan, God laughs,"" and <i>Simple Math </i>is proof that your existential crises and epiphanies can't be micromanaged.</p></div>"|15453.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15453-simple-math/|5.5|Ian Cohen

That's how Jimmy ""Jay"" Lindsey credited himself in the liner notes of his first proper LP, 1998's <i>Teenage Hate</i>. He also billed himself as Jay Reatard, the pseudonym he would use on a staggering number of recordings until his death early last year. According to a transcript included with this deluxe reissue of <i>Teenage Hate</i>, Reatard was a name taken on one night not long before the material was recorded, during a live set comprised of Bay City Rollers covers. ""After our first song some guy with a big green mohawk yelled out 'you guys are fucking reatarded [sic],'"" he said. ""So at the next garage party we played, I announced us as the Reatards kinda as a joke but the name fit so we kept it.""</p>
<p>The name Reatard was both a self-deprecating goof and an homage to Ramones and Oblivians, the latter being the Memphis-born garage-punk crew that served as his friends and mentors. Eric Oblivian's (née Friedl) Goner Records shop acted as Reatard's library, just as the Goner imprint is responsible for Reatard's first releases, including this one. Greg Oblivian (née Cartwright, currently of Reigning Sound) sat in on drums for <i>Fuck Elvis</i>, an added bonus collection of mostly solo four-track recordings originally released on cassette. As a first step, both <i>Teenage Hate</i> and <i>Fuck Elvis Here's the Reatards</i> are astonishing. All the energy one could hear in Reatard's better-known work is here in it's rawest, most volatile form. It's the same electricity he was able to funnel into his synth-punk adventures in Lost Sounds and later harness for 2006's <i>Blood Visions</i>, not to mention his more polished work for Matador just before his death early last year. ""Guitar, screaming, and pounding"" was an accurate credit.</p>
<p>We know that Reatard was prolific. But it's made especially clear here how whole-heartedly and violently he hurled himself into music from the beginning. <i>Teenage Hate</i> in particular has a hot, fantastically gritty quality to it. It's a rough and rude sprint through Southern-inflected, punk-driven garage rock. Reatards were a three-piece that included Steve Albundy Reatard (""Guitar, Occasional Yells"") and Elvis Wong Reatard (""The Skins, Hollering, and Pickin'""), but it's quickly clear that Jay's presence is what sets them apart. You can hear it in the three-chord thwack of ultra-bleak opener ""I'm So Gone"" or the cyclonic sneer of ""I Love Living"", and it only intensifies from there. ""It Ain't Me"" is a two-minute runaway train. The chorus of ""Quite All Right"" lands like a warhead, as does the choir of howled ""motherfuckers"" on ""Down in Flames"".</p>
<p>While the lyrical themes are standard punk fare (he's bored, horny, angry, and lonely; he hates Memphis as much as he loves it), the screaming, red-faced delivery makes them feel personal and true. On ""When I Get Mad"", we get a look at the Jay Reatard who had a reputation for throwing punches. ""When I get mad, I don't think/ Said, I don't give a shit about anything."" Reatard talked a bit in interviews about growing up in Memphis, where Elvis' legacy was inescapable. And though he takes on a few of Elvis' vocal tics here, it's a young Kurt Cobain who comes through most, particularly in the bloody coughing of ""Memphis Blues"". He screams so hopelessly that you'd swear he'd conk himself out from exhaustion. Through 18 tracks just as unfiltered, he never quits.</p>
<p>And though its recording quality renders it flat in comparison, <i>Fuck Elvis</i> is a welcome addition as far as bonus reissue material goes. Many of its songs can be found on <i>Teenage Hate</i> with added muscle and clarity, so it plays more like a cache of early demos. The aforementioned ""Memphis Blues"" makes a blurry appearance, Reatard introducing it with a very appropriate, ""Are you ready to rock'n'roll? Well, here I go..."" There's a lot to dig into in the bonus material, much of it still coming into focus but all of it stamped Reatard's own. Alongside covers of Fear and Buddy Holly, Reatard offers herculean takes on Lil Bunnies' ""Carrot Belly Bunny Blues"" and early Beatles' B-Side ""I'm Down"", a live recording tacked on to close the set. It's insanely sloppy and dissonant, Reatard's screams barely audible over cymbal crash and sludgy guitar, all the way to the finish. ""We're the Reatards,"" he says. ""Thanks."" People shout for encores.</p></div>"|15475.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15475-teenage-hate/|8.6|David Bevan

When the D.C. rapper first came on the scene, he was a hero to a certain kind of fan-- a conscious rapper who talked about sneakers just as easily as he talked about struggles, and one who seemed comfortable rapping over different styles but who remained tied to his city's grassroots go-go scene. 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11963-the-mixtape-about-nothing/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Mixtape About Nothing</i></a> took its ""Seinfeld"" theme as an unlikely jumping-off point and ended up on plenty of year-end best-of lists.

But ""No Hands"" became a massive rap-radio hit and probably saved Wale's career. In guest appearances since then, he's been remaking himself as a snarly pimp, a role that actually fits him pretty well. And then, in a truly unlikely move, surging drug-rap superstar Rick Ross signed Wale to his Maybach Music imprint.</p>
<p>Rick Ross had a triumphant 2010. He scored the hit of the summer with the blaring gangsta anthem ""B.M.F. (Blowin' Money Fast)""-- this despite the fact that everyone now knows that he spent time pre-rap as a prison guard and that all his tales of kingpin life are straight theatrical bullshit. He's also greatly improved as a rapper since his inauspicious beginnings, concentrating on his strengths and finding a decadent edge for his grunt-heavy, larger-than-life delivery. His <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14482-teflon-don/"" target=""_blank""><i>Teflon Don</i></a> was one of rap's best albums of 2010. And after the year he just had, he must feel like he can do anything; that's one way, anyway, to explain the roster he's assembled at Maybach Music.</p>
<p>Right now, the label features mostly promising young critic favorites who haven't shown the kind of charisma it takes to be an actual star; Wale is just the beginning. There's also Meek Mill, a young and squeaky-voiced Philly rapper who carries the torch for ex-State Property guys like Peedi Crakk. There's Pill, a raspy fast-rapping Atlanta mixtape guy. There's Teedra Moses, a long-underrated R&amp;B singer-songwriter who hasn't been anywhere near the pop marketplace since she released her strong 2004 album <i>Complex Simplicity</i>. All these artists have their strengths, and all of them work best in very specific contexts. But on the group album <i>Self Made, Vol. 1</i>, Ross pulls all of them away from their respective comfort zones and tosses them headfirst into the stormy, orchestral arena-rap that he himself favors. The end result is predictable: they all sound lost.</p>
<p>Wale, Meek, and Pill are all gifted technical rappers, but technical rappers can disappear when they show up on something like Just Blaze's stormy, cluttered title track. Even though all three MCs have distinct voices, accents, and deliveries, they blur into one multisyllabic mush on songs like these-- dancing around the edges of these tracks rather than bulldozing through them the way Ross does. (Moses, meanwhile, is generally limited to cooing wordlessly in the background; she's sadly a non-factor here.) Of the three rappers, Meek has the best moments; tough-talking hard on the street single ""Tupac Back"" (though his Pac impression could use some work). Pill shows no signs of any discernible personality here, but his growl of a voice makes him a decent-enough supporting player on a few of these tracks. But Wale just sounds utterly confused, kvetching about his past industry troubles and vowing that he's going to keep his integrity intact even though he sounds more interested in talking about clothes and girls than in displaying any of that vaunted integrity. At this point, he seems to have no idea who he is.</p>
<p>Ross mostly takes a backseat on the album, but his brief appearances, usually limited to hooks, show why he's in a different universe from his  charges. A song like ""Pacman"" is clearly intended as a Pill showcase, but Ross is tough and loose and funny (""All my power pellets, turn you bitch niggas to ghosts!"") while Pill is serious and clenched and anonymous. When non-Maybach Music guests stop through, the problem gets even worse. Jadakiss absolutely schools Wale on ""600 Benz"", while J. Cole-- a rapper with an Internet-friendly mixtape pedigree just like the younger Maybach Music guys-- still whups everyone's ass on ""Fitted Cap"". Longtime Ross associate Gunplay only gets one appearance, which is too bad; he conveys more verve and passion in his one verse than his new labelmates manage in all their showcases.</p>
<p>If Wale, Meek, and Pill could find a way to focus on their own strengths, maybe they'd sound more comfortable alongside their new boss. Instead, they all sound like they're trying to become mini-Rosses, and it doesn't work for them. <i>Self Made, Vol. 1 </i>is designed to demonstrate that Ross' new proteges can succeed in rap's major leagues, but it proves the opposite.</p></div>"|15472.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15472-mmg-presents-self-made-vol-1/|5.3|Tom Breihan

He's studied under free jazz guru Anthony Braxton, contributed to Department of Eagles' <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12275-in-ear-park/"" target=""_blank"">In Ear Park</a> </i>as well as Vampire Weekend's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13807-contra/"" target=""_blank""><i>Contra</i></a>, and has been the bassist in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Projectors</a>. Over the course of nine years, he's also recorded several solo full-lengths (not to mention a split collaboration with Extra Life) that are equally varied. <i>People Changes</i>, his fifth, is a rich addition.</p>
<p>The <span style=""text-decoration: line-through;"">recording</span> writing process this time out took Baldwin to a remote cabin in Maine. That sort of setting may sound familiar, and, like Bon Iver's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10709-for-emma-forever-ago/"" target=""_blank"">debut</a> splash, this is a record with a wonderful ambiance. Unlike most of 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11489-most-valuable-player/"" target=""_blank""><i>Most Valuable Player</i></a>, <i>People Changes</i> finds Baldwin largely on his own: just his voice and bass, with help from a few friends. Baldwin sings in a lovely melisma, the same slippery style used by his Dirty Projectors bandmate Dave Longstreth. But while Longstreth's voice will often crunch itself up into grotesque shapes, Baldwin keeps his airborne. It serves as a terrific juxtaposition to the spare arrangements of <i>People Changes</i>. The earthen tones of his double-bass act as both anchor and trampoline for Baldwin's voice, an instrument that flutters and swoops as it pleases.</p>
<p>On opener ""A Little Lost"", an Arthur Russell cover originally played by its composer on cello, they both begin high. Baldwin is often one to scratch his strings for dissonance, but here, he opts for softer textures-- a sort of bedding. This fits both the song's gentle lyrical gait as well as Baldwin's singing. Where Russell's original worked within a traditional pop template, utilizing choruses and verses, Baldwin's tends to embellish around those borders. It gives everything a wide-open feeling, just as it does it does in closer ""Let My Spirit Rise"". On paper, lines like ""Kiss me once for yourself"" might seem like material more suited for navelgazing singer-songwriters. But despite what the arrangement or lack of structure might suggest, this is every bit the pop song. Its fantastic array of textures sets it apart all the more.</p>
<p>Those only grow more interesting as <i>People Changes</i> unfolds. While woodwinds burble in the high-wire drama of ""Weights"", Baldwin injects blasts of guitar, sax, and snare to the quiet of ""Lifted"". The brief ""What Is There"" is an instrumental exploration of his bass in which he conjures elemental groans and belches. And whether Baldwin is singing with his throat or his bow, there's a thrilling feeling of freedom to it all.</p></div>"|15481.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15481-people-changes/|7.9|David Bevan

Not every record they make is a masterpiece, but they always deliver diligent, worthwhile music. The same is true of Sightings, whose latest LP happens to be released on Our Mouth, the label run by Mouthus' Brian Sullivan. The two bands have lots of similarities-- each takes a workman-like approach to its music, each has a patience that makes even its wildest moments sound thoughtful, and each relies on a uniquely dissonant guitar sound and hybrid acoustic/electronic drumming. Most importantly, both like to carve structures out of their noise. Their brittle feedback and clanging rhythms can be harsh, but even their most abstract stuff is carefully shaped.</p>
<p>On recent Sightings albums, those shapes have become more prominent. 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10878-through-the-panama/"" target=""_blank"">Through the Panama</a> </i>even had some hummable tunes, and 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14134-city-of-straw/"" target=""_blank"">City of Straw</a> </i>continued that momentum. On <i>Future Accidents</i>, Sightings are less concerned with short, sharp nuggets. There is one track-- the churning, hardcore-tinted ""The Knotted House""-- that pours its energy into a five-minute burst. But the remainder of the album is more expansive. Its sounds as if some particular ideas were itching at Sightings, and they decided to scratch away until music bled out.</p>
<p>That may sound brutal, but this is actually their mellowest effort to date. Other Sightings records, particularly 2004's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7145-arrived-in-gold/"" target=""_blank""><i>Arrived in Gold</i></a>, are sparser and more restrained, but <i>Future Accidents </i>has the smoothest surface. Mark Morgan's trademark guitar sound, a singularly metallic scrape, is a bit more distant here. Think of it and his snarling voice as the supporting cast to the starring rhythmic loops of bassist Richard Hoffman and drummer Jon Lockie. It may be a stretch to call this Sightings' Krautrock album, but there are some grooves here, and the band rides them as if hypnotized.</p>
<p>At least, there's something Faust-like about the final track, ""Public Remains"", which at 19 minutes takes up about half of <i>Future Accidents. </i>However it came together, it sounds chopped up and rearranged, echoing some of the rattling, broken-machine collages on <i>The Faust Tapes</i>. It's one of the most abstract things the band has ever done-- even their early attacks had songs buried at the bottom, while this piece is more like audio sculpture. But it's also detailed and organized, again bearing a methodical approach that, for this group, has become second nature. Which makes the album title kind of funny-- with Sightings, it's hard to imagine anything being an accident, now or in the future.</p></div>"|15480.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15480-future-accidents/|7.0|Marc Masters

It's the first time in 15 years that one of her projects has seen release on Slumberland (the Bay Area indie previously put out a self-titled 10"" from her collaboration with All Girl Summer Fun Band's Jen Sbragia as the Softies.) It's also the first time she's fronted a band making this kind of racket since her days as a member of the early 1990s noise-pop outfit Tiger Trap. So for anyone who has been following along with her more low-key work in the interim, the rocky blast that kicks off <i>Brave Irene</i> opener ""No Fun"" is both a surprise and a welcome look back at the past.</p>
<p>That's not to say she's repeating herself here. Melberg has always been a shapeshifter. While Tiger Trap had a hand in drawing the clattering blueprint for a sound that's still beloved and imitated, the Vancouver-based Brave Irene draws inspiration from a different world of underground rock-- specifically, the rolling ""Dunedin Sound"" that came from esteemed New Zealand label Flying Nun in the 1980s and 90s. The Kiwi callback comes mostly in the form of Caitlin Gilroy and Jessica Wilkin's dual keyboard assault; their seasick lines dart in and out of the eight songs here, providing a see-sawing motion to even the EP's least ""rocking"" song, the sweet ""Bank Holiday"". Coupled with the rapidly precise drumming of Laura Hatfield, Brave Irene's keyboard-heavy sound carries with it a hint of psychedelia.</p>
<p>There's nothing distinctly ""trippy"" about Brave Irene as a whole, though; these songs contain the same questions of the heart that fans of Melberg's output expect from her projects. She delivers those musings in her bright, empathetic voice-- the same one that made the Softies' dreamy, drumless songs so instantly inviting. Not a word is wasted, from the long-distance heartbreak of ""River to the Sea"" to the fearless flight of ""Hit the Grass Running"", pronounced with an arresting intimacy that feels refreshingly out of step with current indie trends. After all, this is ""feelings"" music, and if you can't parse the sentiments, how do you relate?</p>
<p>That directness is what places <i>Brave Irene</i> in the here and now. Obviously, the ""Slumberland sound"" has been warmed over plenty of times by younger artists with impeccable record collections and keen ears for replication. But little of the recent revivalism has sounded this fresh and bright-- ironic, given how long Melberg has been at it. There's plenty to like here, whether you've been approaching indie pop through its new disciples or you're the kind of person wondering if Cub will ever make another record. For a band with such strong ties to the past, Brave Irene's future sounds especially appealing.</p></div>"|15426.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15426-brave-irene-ep/|7.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

Where the previous decade saw Cave successfully transition out of the Birthday Party's combustible punk toward a more urbane, theatrical brand of rock, the 90s elevated him to the realm of archetype and institution. He successfully party-crashed Hollywood and ""Top of the Pops"", all while the college-radio charts filled up with emergent artists-- PJ Harvey, Tindersticks, Afghan Whigs-- cut from the Bad Seeds' black-velvet cloth.</p>
<p>The Bad Seeds' mid-90s pinnacle forms the basis of the latest round of Mute's excellent reissue series, which include vividly remastered versions of the original albums, along with a 5.1 surround sound mix, B-sides, official videos, and the latest installments of Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard's illuminating fan-testimonial documentaries, <i>Do You Love Me Like I Love You?</i> The title of the film series is taken from the two-part song that opens and closes <i>Let Love In</i>, an authoritative show of force that was perfectly timed for the Bad Seeds' insurrectionary appearance on the 1994 Lollapalooza tour. The Bad Seeds had always traded in high drama and dissonance, but never before had they sounded this imposingly heavy-- the lecherous intimations of ""Do You Love Me?"" explode into a torrent of chain-gang vocals and drummer Thomas Wydler's machine-gunned snare rolls, while ""Loverman"" triggers its quiet-to-loud eruptions so masterfully, Metallica would later cover the song to the surprise of no one.</p>
<p>But amid <i>Let Love In</i>'s ballast, you can hear Cave's increased adeptness at exploring his fascinations using sly, pitch-black humor instead of transgressive shock tactics. ""Red Right Hand""-- the future theme song of the <i>Scream</i> film franchise-- sets its serial-killer narrative to a seductive swampy groove, and the beautiful piano ballad ""Nobody's Baby Now"" is a work of such wry, understated elegance, Cave originally thought of giving it to Johnny Cash.</p>
<p>As <i>Let Love In</i>'s signature tracks proved, Cave's love songs could easily  turn into death songs, so it was inevitable that he'd devote an entire  album to exploring that symbiotic relationship. <i>Murder Ballads</i> has a title so obvious and self-defining, it's amazing that it took the Bad Seeds nine albums to use it. And the last thing you could accuse Cave of is false advertising: Dozens of characters lose their lives over the course of the album, which updates infamous folk tales like ""Stagger Lee"" with enough profanity and gratuitous violence to satisfy the bloodlusty standards of the post-gangsta rap/Quentin Tarantino era.</p>
<p>But the Bad Seeds' most lyrically depraved record is also their most musically ornate and accessible, with the band expanding to accommodate Dirty Three violinist Warren Ellis and former Cramps/Sonic Youth stickman Jim Sclavunos (as second percussionist), plus a pair of smoldering duets with PJ Harvey (""Henry Lee"") and Kylie Minogue (the unlikely MTV hit ""Where the Wild Roses Grow""). In fact, with its densely detailed storylines, heart-racing epics (""Song of Joy"", ""The Curse of Millhaven"") and cheeky curtain-closing cover of Bob Dylan's born-again anthem ""Death Is Not the End"", it's hard not to imagine <i>Murder Ballads</i> as some perverse, alternate-universe West End musical production. But look past its comically over-the-top presentation and you realize Cave isn't simply indulging in some subversive genre exercise. He was examining the very idea of poetic license, pushing the limits of what an artist can get away with in a song when writing in character.</p>
<p><i>The Boatman's Call</i> is Cave's plea for redemption, an album every bit as dignified as its predecessor is deranged. After spending much of his career spinning yarns out of other people's misery, Cave-- emerging from a divorce and a highly publicized but short-lived affair with PJ Harvey-- comes clean about his own. On the stirring piano-based hymns ""Into My Arms"" and ""There Is a Kingdom"", he looks to religion less as a convenient dramatic device and more as the genuine refuge for the lonely soul. Cave had flirted with tender balladry many times before, but whereas previous turns like ""Straight to You"" and ""The Ship Song"" were shot through the Bad Seeds' widescreen lens, here, the atmosphere is so spare and intimate, you feel like you're curled up inside Cave's piano. More than any other album in this batch of reissues, <i>The Boatman's Call</i> is greatly enriched by a remaster that amplifies the magnitude of Cave's loneliness, from the burning-ember ambience of ""Lime Tree Arbour"" to Ellis' trembling violin lines on the absolutely devastating ""Far From Me"". But even though <i>The Boatman's Call</i> is Cave's most confessional, open-hearted album, its sense of sorrow and catharsis transcends a strictly personal interpretation. It speak volumes about the album's universality that its songs have soundtracked everything from Michael Hutchence's funeral to <i>Shrek 2</i>.</p>
<p>Following that triumphant triptych, it would be another four years before Cave reemerged with a new album, during which he finally kicked his recurring, 15-year heroin addiction once and for all. Not surprisingly, <i>No More Shall We Part </i>carries the tentative air of an artist and band trying to reconnect with their muse, and with one another. <i>No More</i> feels more like a transitory album than a definitive statement, one that showcases the increasingly crucial role of Ellis' mournful violin-playing to the band's sound, but perhaps at the expense of founding members Blixa Bargeld (who would leave the band in 2003), and Mick Harvey (who would follow suit in 2009). Tellingly, Bargeld and Harvey are nowhere to be seen in the <i>No More</i> set's accompanying installment of <i>Do You Love Me</i>, after making prominent appearances in each of the series' previous episodes.</p>
<p>But amid its stately sprawl and gorgeous guest vocals from folk legends Kate and Anna McGarrigle, <i>No More Shall We Part </i>effectively points the way from the desolate, piano-bar introspection of <i>The Boatman's Call</i> toward the swagger, bombast, and cutting humor that would define the Bad Seeds' output throughout the rest of the coming decade. Following <i>No More</i>'s release, Cave would switch labels to Anti- and, with 2003's <i>Nocturama</i>, ignite a more raucous, raw-powered phase of his career that's currently manifested itself in the Bad Seeds' hellacious alter-ego act, Grinderman. But if <i>No More Shall We Part </i>seems less distinguished next to Cave's mid-90s streak and his reinvigorated Anti- output, it represents an important turning point in the Bad Seeds discography. At the onset of the 2000s, Cave had essentially completed the transformation from being an artist who would soundtrack your funeral into one who could provide the first-dance song at your wedding; <i>No More Shall We Part </i>marks that pivotal moment where Cave regains the sensation in his red right hand.</p></div>"|15476.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15476-let-love-in-murder-ballads-the-boatmans-call-no-more-shall-we-part/|8.5|Stuart Berman

In fact, with its densely detailed storylines, heart-racing epics (""Song of Joy"", ""The Curse of Millhaven"") and cheeky curtain-closing cover of Bob Dylan's born-again anthem ""Death Is Not the End"", it's hard not to imagine <i>Murder Ballads</i> as some perverse, alternate-universe West End musical production.

After spending much of his career spinning yarns out of other people's misery, Cave-- emerging from a divorce and a highly publicized but short-lived affair with PJ Harvey-- comes clean about his own. On the stirring piano-based hymns ""Into My Arms"" and ""There Is a Kingdom"", he looks to religion less as a convenient dramatic device and more as the genuine refuge for the lonely soul. Cave had flirted with tender balladry many times before, but whereas previous turns like ""Straight to You"" and ""The Ship Song"" were shot through the Bad Seeds' widescreen lens, here, the atmosphere is so spare and intimate, you feel like you're curled up inside Cave's piano. More than any other album in this batch of reissues, <i>The Boatman's Call</i> is greatly enriched by a remaster that amplifies the magnitude of Cave's loneliness, from the burning-ember ambience of ""Lime Tree Arbour"" to Ellis' trembling violin lines on the absolutely devastating ""Far From Me"". But even though <i>The Boatman's Call</i> is Cave's most confessional, open-hearted album, its sense of sorrow and catharsis transcends a strictly personal interpretation. It speak volumes about the album's universality that its songs have soundtracked everything from Michael Hutchence's funeral to <i>Shrek 2</i>.</p>
<p>Following that triumphant triptych, it would be another four years before Cave reemerged with a new album, during which he finally kicked his recurring, 15-year heroin addiction once and for all. Not surprisingly, <i>No More Shall We Part </i>carries the tentative air of an artist and band trying to reconnect with their muse, and with one another. <i>No More</i> feels more like a transitory album than a definitive statement, one that showcases the increasingly crucial role of Ellis' mournful violin-playing to the band's sound, but perhaps at the expense of founding members Blixa Bargeld (who would leave the band in 2003), and Mick Harvey (who would follow suit in 2009). Tellingly, Bargeld and Harvey are nowhere to be seen in the <i>No More</i> set's accompanying installment of <i>Do You Love Me</i>, after making prominent appearances in each of the series' previous episodes.</p>
<p>But amid its stately sprawl and gorgeous guest vocals from folk legends Kate and Anna McGarrigle, <i>No More Shall We Part </i>effectively points the way from the desolate, piano-bar introspection of <i>The Boatman's Call</i> toward the swagger, bombast, and cutting humor that would define the Bad Seeds' output throughout the rest of the coming decade.

The lyrical concerns are pretty straightforward (hint: jumping and pools are involved), but what makes it one of the LP's standouts is how its chorus takes the titular advice and just <i>goes for it</i>, changing from peppy polyrhythms to fast, charging lushness in a matter of seconds. It's a melodic shift that's as over-the-top as it is impressively delivered-- but that's kind of the point. <i>Friendly Fires</i> was best when playing to the rafters with romantic electro-gaze textures (""Skeleton Boy"") and big, cheesy gestures (""Paris""). They're sensualists who excel under a lack of restraint.</p>
<p>Wisely, the band's sophomore effort, <i>Pala</i>, wastes no time submerging itself into its own indulgent environment. The multi-layered neon pop of album opener ""Live Those Days Tonight"" only hints at the LP's sonic ambition, as the band's immense co-production with buzz-bin consigliere Paul Epworth lends extra depth to its colorful sonic detail. There's been three years between <i>Friendly Fires</i> and this thing, and they've clearly spent it well by jewelling every last detail with careful precision (the B-movie blast that spools off ""Blue Cassette""'s final reel, ""Helpless""' backseat chatter and Boards of Canada keyboards).</p>
<p>To an extent, <i>Pala</i> also clears these guys' name on the ""rockist dance-dilettante"" list. From the galloping UK funky rhythm in ""Chimes"" to the filtered, bleeping funk of ""Hurting"", there's an array of styles tried on and, for the most part, successfully worn. Those successes speak as much to the band's listening habits as they do to a sense of maximalist adventurousness.</p>
<p>However, all the signifiers in the world don't change the fact that Friendly Fires are a rock band <i>first</i>-- and a particularly emotive one, at that. The band's three members got their start as teenagers in the never-known vocal-less ""post-hardcore"" (read: emo) outfit First Day Back. Anyone who's ever had a taste for that stuff knows that once it enters your blood, it tends to stay there, and <i>Pala</i>'s high-stakes framework reflects that. Hearts are set on fire regularly (no, not like that), while impassioned pleas ""Show Me Lights"" and ""Pull Me Back to Earth"" are exactly as sweeping as you'd expect. It's when the band gets too entrenched in maudlin, dark-hued dramatizing (the too-slow-burn of the title track, ""Chimes""' bald-faced falsetto foolery) that <i>Pala</i>'s deep-sea diving feels similar to drowning.</p>
<p>Not to worry, though-- they have a sense of humor too, as ""Hawaiian Air"" proves. As the title suggests, frontman Ed Macfarlane's lyrical concerns focus on a trip to, you guessed it, Hawaii-- only, he spends the entire song detailing his escapades on the flight there (""watching a film with a talking dog,"" ""skipping the meal for a G&amp;T""), barely able to breathe in that tropical oxygen. It's a simple-pleasures zoom-in that belies the album's candy-painted sweep, a sneaky yet sentimental grin amidst all the pleading and sincerity-- 'cause this stuff is supposed to be fun, right?</p></div>"|15463.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15463-pala/|7.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

Stylistically, it's almost schizophrenic-- tracks alternate between shoegaze, Krautrock, post-rock, experimental drone, and acoustic ambiance, and those modes don't often meet together in one place. Yet the overall mood is forcefully consistent, with a weight approaching gravitational pull. That tone is captured somewhat in the cover art's stark silhouettes, but even that image is a little too colorful for this hazy, shadow-filled sound-cloud. Whenever I listen, I picture the music emanating from a mesmerizing field of TV static, roughly like what the little girl stared into in <i>Poltergeist</i>'s iconic image.</p>
<p>That may seem a bit overdramatic, but Implodes sound like they take their music pretty seriously, and they should. It's carefully crafted and wholly enveloping, a kind of dream-state atmosphere where vocals shiver behind layers of fuzz, rhythms detonate like underwater explosions, and acoustic guitars drift in and out like flashes of déjà vu. Some tracks on their own might sound a bit derivative-- ""Marker""'s floating noise has a Slowdive tint, ""Screech Owl"" bears the spooky lurch of early Sonic Youth, and the slow melodrama of Mogwai slips into ""Song for Fucking Damon II (Trap Door)"". Others pass through corridors of the Kranky catalog, skirting spaces between Labradford, Bowery Electric, and Jessamine. But when fused together by Implodes' assured sense of narrative thrust, these songs are much more echoes than mimicry-- like an unfamiliar, moonlit landscape dotted with fleeting glimpses of past ghosts.</p>
<p>All of which makes for a pretty heavy listen. Dense, dark, and slow even when it's fast, <i>Black Earth </i>can get murky and claustrophobic, sucking in the air around it. There's a fine line between mesmerizing and depressing, and while I find myself squarely on the entranced side throughout, I can see where others might find the dimmer passageways more blinding than beckoning. But this is where the band's stylistic diversity helps. While a deep drone like ""Oxblood"" may burrow the center of the earth, it's immediately countered by the motoring sway of ""Meadowlands"", or the hymn-like buzz of ""Wendy"", or the lilting blur of ""Experiential Report"". Which is why the most interesting thing about <i>Black Earth </i>is what it bodes for Implodes' future. If they can already mold this many sounds into the same tonal shape, imagine what further sonic territory they might someday place their stamp on.</p></div>"|15465.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15465-black-earth/|7.5|Marc Masters

You wouldn't ever congratulate a friend who spent months getting his oven to function as a refrigerator, but anyone who can make a vacuum sound like an 808 can prepare for notoriety, if not outright praise. Artists such as Matthew Herbert, the Field, and Matmos have diced sounds until their notable sources are barely detectable. So it goes with 2562, whose third album, <i>Fever</i>, was inspired by disco music (hence the title) released in the late 1970s around the time of the producer's birth. It's probably a smart gambit for the producer: His first two albums, while well received, were more notable for expanding dubstep's geographical imprint (2562 is the postal code of the producer's home in the Hague) than its sonic one.</p>
<p>Despite its roots-- every last sound here is sampled from disco records-- <i>Fever</i> is a fairly catholic dubstep set: Racketeering snares, ominous chord structures, and a vague melodic distension pervade the album. Still, you can hear the fruits of his labor, especially in comparison to 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13622-unbalance/""><i>Unbalance</i></a>. <i>Fever</i> is warmer, due both to its subtle vinyl crackle and the vague symphonic timbre that hovers whenever its minute samples are massed in melody. The persistent, four-on-the-floor clacking that propels ""Brasil Deadwalker"" is a visceral reminder of how techno and house borrowed and digitized disco's rhythmic structure. The anthemic opener ""Winamp Melodrama"" (great title) grabs a Gamble &amp; Huff hammer and bangs everything in sight. 2562 doesn't employ vocal samples very often, but on the album-closing title track he gathers several into a dense fog and achieves a kind of beauty rarely attempted elsewhere on the album.</p>
<p>About that: <i>Fever</i>, like 2562's previous records, is hard music. There is no wobble in the bass or flutter in the melodies; they are presented as-is, with little space for the listener. <i>Fever </i>can sound plastic, unpliable at times. I can hear the echoes of those old disco records in these sounds, but I can't find any of the laughter, silliness, or goodwill that fueled them. 2562 spent a lot of time molding one genre of music into another: It's safe to say he cares about sound for sound's sake. Which is fine, but it also means that the process that drove <i>Fever</i>'s creation wasn't undertaken in an effort to illuminate the source material (it should be said that while most genres of dance music owe a healthy debt to disco, dubstep is really more of a third cousin than a granddaughter) or forge new territory. It was done as an exercise.</p>
<p>So parts of <i>Fever</i>-- the bone-on-bone thwacks that close ""Flavour Park Jam"", for instance-- are essentially just 2562 going through the motions: the tedious, musically rigorous motions. I adore the idea behind <i>Fever</i>, and the attempt to artistically bind oneself to a process like this is brave. But in boxing himself in, 2562 seems to have found just a new box, a constricted area where several of his compositions suffocate. Those that escape are enjoyable as some kind of tonally curious, hardscrabble bass music, which is where 2562 began in the first place.</p></div>"|15451.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15451-fever/|5.8|Andrew Gaerig

Mat Cothran, the sole member of the South Carolina downer pop project, spent time in between sessions carrying microphones around, looking for the opportunity to record on equipment he stumbled upon. Lacking funds and created against the backdrop of the belly-up mill town he grew up in, <i>Blue Suicide</i> is expectedly blue. Perhaps not as expected is how ambitious and arresting this album can be, taking its emotional cues from the lovesick and bored American Gothic landscapes it was conceived in, and its musical touchstones from just about anywhere Cothran's determination allowed.</p>
<p>There's a moment on ""Greater Vultures"" that helps put this process-- and the end result-- into perspective. Instead of amping up the poignancy on this dirge-like wallow by employing a weepy string part, Cothran brings in a sort of monster-movie synth line that's both oddly placed and a little disquieting. It's possibly a move made out of necessity, but it's these limitations and what Cothran does with them where the magnetism lies. When he creatively skirts these hindrances, it's often what keeps you on the hook. In the case of ""Greater Vultures"", it allows the song to take on a much deeper desperation. As Cothran murmurs, ""Are you willing to eat what the vultures will not?"" it's pretty clear that this acceptance of a less than perfect situation is a valuable part of Cothran's approach, as well as <i>Blue Suicide</i>'s appeal.</p>
<p>Which isn't to say it doesn't succumb to mere convenience at times. There are plenty of songs that seem comfortable just floating by in ways that clash with Cothran's larger ambitions. But there's always something to hold onto, no matter how shaky the foundation may be. Cothran-- by no means a flexible singer-- often alternates between a buzzing lilt and a dolorous hush throughout the album, but he has an ear for melodic hooks, often testing his limits with surprising results. ""Lindsey"" sounds like a <i>Siamese Dream</i>-era Smashing Pumpkins demo, with Cothran miming Billy Corgan at a dramatic extreme. ""Caroline, Please Kill Me"" is equally pleasing, boisterous and whiny with a radio-friendly enthusiasm. The fact that these bigger songs sound so homemade (though well-mixed and recorded) may prove detrimental to some, but it's hard not to admire a guy who has the gall to flatly ignore his relative inexperience in favor of just going for it.</p>
<p>There are moments that come close to real greatness. ""Her Sinking Sun"" is a devastating hymn that can barely scrape itself off the ground to greet you, but Cothran isn't the kind of songwriter who gets off on sulking. ""Sinking Sun"" harnesses the gloom in such a visceral way, it has the strength to puncture. ""Eva Angelina"" is even better, mostly because it's the most self-assured offering here-- a patient, slow-blooming heartbreaker that gets under your skin. More importantly, it's proof that there are truly impressive songs in Cothran.

Indeed, the Beck Hansen-helmed album was made mostly with six- and 12-string acoustic guitars, harps, violins, bass (sometimes upright), and drums. But to call this record ""folk"" or ""acoustic"" is to mistakenly suggest that it's relaxed comfort music from an aging dude who still sings about teenage riots with his hoary rock band. Rather, <i>Demolished Thoughts</i> is as immediate and form-warping as Moore's work with Sonic Youth, comprising nine anxious, charged songs about fleeting time and failing happiness, played with veteran resilience. Jokes about old men and their Martins need not apply.</p>
<p>The essentials of this project might recall <i>Trees Outside the Academy</i>, Moore's song-oriented solo album from 2007. (The ""song-oriented"" distinction is necessary if reductive, as Moore seems to release between one and, oh, 47 experimental discs every year.) Violinist Samara Lubelski is the only <i>Trees</i> alumna on <i>Demolished Thoughts</i>. Moore returns with a consistent, cohesive band-- Lubelski, harpist Mary Lattimore, guitarist Bill Nace, Hansen and his regular collaborators, drummer Joey Waronker and bassist Bram Inscore. As such, this is a much more rigorous and singular album, constructed with a definite, deliberate sonic approach that his previous solo work has foregone. <i>Trees</i> had its moments, but, as a whole, it was uneasy and unsettled, as though Moore finally made it into a studio to record ideas he'd tucked away in notebooks during Sonic Youth tours. <i>Demolished Thoughts</i> feels less like a side-project of afterthoughts, more like a careful album cut with a smartly assembled band.</p>
<p>Instruments aside, <i>Demolished Thoughts</i> isn't built like typical folk music, or even the chiseled chamber folk of the last decade or so. The hazy, nearly seven-minute ""Orchard Street"", for instance, gets through its lyrics in nearly half its running time; the second, instrumental half sounds like an acoustic reinvention of the glorious codas from Sonic Youth's <i>Murray Street</i>, the role of the pounding drums taken by battered guitar strings, the squall of the electric guitars replicated with harp runs and violin trills. The album's other longer stretch, the appropriately titled ""Space"", moves in perfectly expanding and contracting waves. Moore enters with the tone of someone who's given up on patience: ""I used to have all the time in the world/ Cruising galaxies in search of gold,"" he sings, the unease in his voice dismissing any back-porch associations. Even at their prettiest, like the slow-rolling and sad-eyed ""Benediction"" or the gently exhaling closer, ""January"", these songs move in unexpected ways, whether it's the players pushing into unlikely patterns or the production embellishing some unseen aspect. As with his other band, Moore succeeds by folding great ideas into otherwise good songs.</p>
<p>Beck's production is actually as essential and interesting as these tunes. He stretches Moore's songs without polishing them, giving them a pop number's scope and ambition without seeming obvious or pedantic. ""Circulation"" is a nervous collage of busy images-- needles hitting records, friends on the move, speakers, lights, cries, shots. Hansen pushes the core pieces of the song close together, so that Inscore's bass lashes violently against Moore's layers of heavy-handed strums. And on ""In Silver Rain With a Paper Key"", Hansen adds a trail of echo to Moore's plaintive tone, allowing the words to float like dust among guitars and string parts. Not lo-fi per se but purposefully damaged, the recording mimics Moore's loneliness and disorientation if only by way of atmosphere.</p>
<p>Moore, who will turn 53 this summer, is several years older than many of the bandleaders to emerge as indie rock luminaries with his success and staying power-- J Mascis, Henry Rollins, Frank Black, for obvious examples. That's reason enough to be sidetracked by the talk of mellow folk vibes. While Moore's been putting out records for three decades now, <i>Demolished Thoughts </i>feels vital and purposed, more like a debut than an encore. It's the work of a restless artist fighting successfully through his own skin to not only outstrip our expectations of how he sounds but also of the sort of music acoustic guitars and harps can make. With <i>Demolished Thoughts</i>, Thurston Moore solo albums have become more than fields of noise throwaways spiked with the occasional gem, more than Sonic Youth stopgaps. A lot of people retire after 30 years, but Moore has added another great line to an overwhelming résumé.</p></div>"|15474.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15474-demolished-thoughts/|8.1|Grayson Currin

Howe Gelb is the view. Over the course of his long career, Gelb-- either as a solo artist or more frequently with his band Giant Sand-- has dabbled in folk, country, alt-rock, gospel, and most combinations thereof. At the center of this shifting guitar music is Gelb's flat sing-talk. Gelb's voice is distinct-- a concrete-gray, nasal uttering-- but it's his dry, funny rambling that has attracted a mild cult following. His latest album, <i>Alegr</i><i>í</i><i>as</i>, credited to Howe Gelb &amp; a Band of Gypsies, is another changing-of-the-drapes renovation, a soft left into flamenco-tinged gypsy folk that was recorded in Spain with a group of Andalucian gypsies (including, notably, guitarist Raimundo Amador).</p>
<p>You might think this sort of far-flung collaborating (Gelb hails from Tucson) would produce results notably removed Gelb's past, but the singer's refusal to bow to his surroundings is arguably his artistic strength. It's important to note that <i>Alegr</i><i>í</i><i>as</i> isn't an album of traditional music: It's closer to ""Howe Gelb hangs out with some gypsy musicians and they make Howe Gelb music."" Gelb even pokes fun at his sonic wanderlust, dryly singing, ""I walk around like I own/ The sound of cowboy boots on cobble stone."" One of my favorite aspects of <i>Alegr</i><i>í</i><i>as</i> is that Gelb all but drops the gypsy conceit when it suits him, the arrangements veering back toward the type of cracked-sidewalk acoustic picking that is his default form.</p>
<p>Still, this is a nice fit. The music's natural rhythmic shiftiness and floral accents balance Gelb's heavy-lidded charm without overwhelming him. In the realm of middle-aged-guys-mumbling-poetically, Gelb lacks (has always lacked) David Berman's precision or Aidan Moffat's liver, but he's self-effacing and casual. He favors scenes over stories, observation over revelation. Unlike a lot of his peers, Gelb has never developed a cult of personality (early, out-of-print Giant Sand albums are currently being reissued to shockingly little fanfare). He sort of represents the median of smart underground songwriters, in part because his songs never even attempt universal truths or gushing emotion. He has never seemed on the verge of breaking out, and it's easier to appreciate Gelb's career in sum. <i>Alegrías</i> is a pleasant stylistic diversion, another in a long series of non-revelations. That's Gelb's appeal: a guy, a thoughtful guy, who won't press you into adoration, even when he deserves it.</p></div>"|15455.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15455-alegrias/|6.3|Andrew Gaerig

Couple this fact with their moniker and the title of their debut LP, <i>It's a Corporate World</i>, and you might peg them as some sort of subversive, <i>Adbusters</i>-influenced project. But Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr. are a sweet, fairly unassuming electro-tinged indie pop band; nothing less, but precious little more. The name, the costumes, and the anti-corporate rumblings all but melt away once you hit play on <i>It's a Corporate World</i>. Bands these days need a hook to stand out from the pack, I realize. If only a few more of those hooks had made it onto the record.</p>
<p>Joshua Epstein and Daniel Zott's collaboration began with a mutual interest in production work, and indeed, <i>Corporate World</i> is both unerringly orderly and rife with background flourishes. Even at their least remarkable, their melodies get by on good-natured exuberance, and the headphone-friendly tarting-up they're given proves time and again the band's best maneuver. Both Epstein and Zott have the sort of warm, softish indie-dude voices that carry their tunes without stepping out in front of them. Nearly everything about the record's so agreeable, so well-engineered and aerodynamic, it just glides.</p>
<p><i>Corporate World</i> leans gently into its melodic curves, leaving most of the twisting and turning to the production. Their debut EP, <i>Horse Power</i>, concluded with a note-perfect cover of the Beach Boys' ""God Only Knows"", more an airtight, Pomplamoose-style layering exercise than a reimagination of that familiar tune. Much of <i>Corporate World</i> feels similarly stacked, although left to their  own melodic devices, these dudes aren't exactly Brian Wilson. More often  than not, they smartly doll up these straightforward tunes in chirpy  harmonies and electroid gurgles, coloring in the clean lines of their  melodies. Highlight ""Nothing But Our Love"" gets along on a chipper enough melody, but its the subtly twittering guitar doodle and head-nod clatter of its beat that actually do the head-sticking. Same with ""Vocal Chords"", a pleasant enough tune boosted by a Tina Weymouth-style bass bump and flittery guitar.</p>
<p>But the sonic dazzle outshines the melodies at the heart of many of these tracks. It's not the main vocal line of ""Skeletons"" you'll take with you into the next track, but the croon swimming through its background; even lilting opener ""Morning Thought,"" one of the set's stronger numbers, seems outmatched by its shimmering keyboards and shuffling rhythm. And when they throw too much on the track, as on the murky ""The Fisherman"" or the snarling, somewhat out-of-place ""When I Open My Eyes"", the record's easygoing pace halts. Sonically rich but melodically staid, <i>Corporate World</i> ultimately brings to mind Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr.'s extramusical affairs: alluring at first, but a bit wanting under the surface.</p></div>"|15468.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15468-its-a-corporate-world/|6.0|Paul Thompson

West Coast producers Kingston and Young God teamed up with a different low-key singer on each of their last couple of albums, but the real allure was still in the duo's layered, expansive instrumentals. Then there was the drama a few years back over Jean Grae team-up <i>The Evil Jeanius</i>; the New York MC went on <a href=""http://replay.web.archive.org/20080924112936/http://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/crs/845951471.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Craigslist</a> and <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/jeangrae/blog/437303028"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MySpace</a> to protest the ""unauthorized"" use of her rhymes (she said it wasn't the beat-makers' fault). BSBD have collaborated with plenty of other indie rappers, most recently including tourmates CunninLynguists, but their latest album suggests they can acquit themselves just fine on their own.</p>
<p>As <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15292-instrumental-mixtape/"">Clams Casino's first beat tape</a> earlier this year demonstrated, some of the best rap instrumentals these days can work equally well as moody electronic music, drifting naturally between the worlds of hip-hop or R&amp;B and ambient, post-dubstep, or chillwave. <i>Noir</i> has a similar way of wringing strangely affecting emotional grandeur from the rudiments of sound, though BSBD's style relies less on glitch or drone and more on starry-eyed orchestral vastness. Using an impressively naunced deployment of strings, piano, and guitar as well as drum loops and hazy synths, the album has a patient, steady beauty, ranging from glowing panoramas evoking M83 to the classical-informed abstraction of Anticon acts like Dosh and Son Lux.</p>
<p>The duo's acronym is apparently skydiver slang, popularized in the 1994 thriller <i>Drop Zone</i>. It implies, ""Sure, appreciate the majesty of nature all you want, but if something goes wrong you'll leave a grisly corpse."" If <i>Noir</i> can't quite fully embody that essential paradox-- it's not particularly noir-ish, either-- it still succeeds in communicating incomprehensible hugeness through sonically detailed tracks with an almost narrative-like structure. There are several standouts, but a good place to start is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4qICd3ldLU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sleeping Children Are Still Flying""</a>, which uses a humid Southern-rock guitar solo and languidly triumphant drum programming to support a string section, a children's choir, and a snippet of dialogue from classic 1986 coming-of-age drama <i>Stand By Me</i>: River Phoenix is talking about dreams, and missed chances. While the kids and the symphonic elements would have no trouble fitting in on an indie pop beach fantasy by Air France, those blues-drenched licks could just as easily soundtrack one of the Weeknd's dangerous liaisons.</p>
<p><i>Noir</i> isn't completely instrumental, then, and in fact uses sung samples as well as the spoken-word variety. But the strongest voice here is BSBD's own-- wide-screen and Technicolor, to mix sensory metaphors. An aching soul vocal from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?q=solomon+burke+%22don%27t+give+up+on+me%22&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=w1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Solomon Burke's ""Don't Give Up on Me""</a> is secondary to a sighing, silvery arrangement and pulsing bass on brief interlude ""Falling Short""; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22dusty+springfield%22+%22the+windmills+of+your+mind%22&amp;aq=f"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dusty Springfield's version of ""The Windmills of Your Mind""</a> complements the hypnotic repetitions and emotional anguish of ""Farewell to the Former World"", which despite its melancholy theme has a snare-heavy rhythm track fit for blasting through car windows on hot days. Or for rapping over: Three years after BSBD's last proper instrumental album, Babygrande release <i>Late Night Cinema</i>, <i>Noir</i> again proves the duo don't need singers or rappers to make their music felt. But that doesn't mean an aspiring MC or two might not be able to make use of their services anyway.</p></div>"|15400.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15400-noir/|7.5|Marc Hogan

It may be small or a little ramshackle but it's there, helping to make recordings available in some sort of semi-orderly fashion. It promotes performances, broadcasts music, talks about music in publications. Mauritania's Beydane and Haratine music has no industry to promote it-- the country is one of the few places in the world with no private or even state system in place to capture and disseminate music. The music happens live, played by musicians hired by an audience; it could be a wedding party, an official function, or just a group of friends who want to do a little dancing. The majority of the musicians live and work in Nouakchott, the sprawling, mostly improvised capital city</p>
<p>Mauritania is a vast country, bigger than Texas and New Mexico combined, but in much of that space there are no people. Nearly every one of the country's roughly three million people lives in the Southwest, near the coast and the Senegal River, and a full third of them are in Nouakchott. The Beydane (who we call Moors) and the Haratine are Mauritania's dominant ethnic groups, and their language, a dialect of Arabic called Hassaniya, is the most widely spoken (along with French, which is used mostly in official contexts). To describe Mauritanian Beydane and Haratine music is superficially simple: It consists primarily of singers, improvising based on poetry, hand percussion, and guitar or a similar local stringed instrument-- guitar has since 1976 largely supplanted the <i>tidinitt </i>lute (played by men) and the <i>ardin</i> harp (played by women).</p>
<p>The guitar is electric, I should add. This, in a city where electricity service is not comprehensive, to say the least. There have been a few attempts to record Beydane guitar music over the years in a controlled, high-fidelity environment, and one could get the impression from listening to these that the music is pretty sedate, but this is misleading. As one listen to <i>Wallahi Le Zein</i> quickly shows, this is music of immense energy. Trying to record it in a studio robs it of the primary engine that drives it, which is audience response. The musicians crank it up when the audience steps it up, and cool it down when the audience gets tired. Matthew Lavoie, the set's compiler, at first attempted to make some of his own recordings in specially arranged sessions with an audience, but to hear him tell it in his extensive liner notes, the lack of a proper music-making occasion resulting in sterile recordings that got the technical bits right but missed on the spirit of the music.</p>
<p>But Lavoie was truly in love with this music, and wouldn't be deterred. Over the course of years and many visits to Mauritania, he collected privately recorded cassettes of performances until he had a massive archive to draw from. It's not unusual for the people paying the musicians to record a performance for a souvenir-- as you can imagine, though, the quality of those recordings is often abysmal, so sorting for a set of tracks that both captured the spirit of the music as it's normally performed and satisfied even some very rudimentary standards of fidelity took some work. The compiler's passion for the music and knowledge of its history, performance and underlying theory is on full display in the thick booklet that comes with this set-- expanding it into a book wouldn't be out of the question.</p>
<p>Without getting too far into the specifics of it, all of the music on this set is built around a very basic modal structure. There are a set number of modes in the music, which must be played in a certain order, and each mode has two different rhythmic characters (one legato, one staccato), to be played in a specific order. But beyond that, it's wide open. Tempo, the actual melody played within the mode, the play of voice against guitar, the rhythm, and a host of other factors come into play in every piece. You have to really study the music to hear the ingredients as distinct from one another.</p>
<p>The recordings are raw, essentially field recordings. People can be heard talking to the musicians, whistling; I swear there's one track where I can hear a chicken at one point. Some are instrumental, some are vocal, and most have muffled hand drums driving the rhythm. The singing is melismatic and full-bore-- it's recognizable if you know much Arabic of West African music. But the meat of this music for a listener who speaks no Hassaniya is the guitar. There is some breathtaking guitar playing in this music, a manic, psychedelic edge and free-floating intensity that makes me think of Hendrix playing ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" but like that all the time. Distortion from blown speaker cones is a common sonic element, but you hear the occasional pedal or strange flanged tone as well.</p>
<p>The music doesn't flow in the sense that Westerners typically expect dance music to flow. It will stop abruptly, turn in unexpected directions, stutter in the middle of a phrase-- this is how the music works, musicians responding to what their audience is doing or saying, how much money it's throwing their way. All of it is decided on the spot-- these musicians don't rehearse written pieces of music, and they frequently perform with musicians they haven't played with before. On a first listen, when you haven't acclimated yourself to what these men and women are doing with the music, it is disorienting. But once you learn to flow with it, it's a rush a minute, and the skill of the players really is something to behold. Baba ould Hembara does this thing on his tracks where he's hammering the strings with his left hand, finely articulating full melodies with a hammer-on-- it sounds like the chatter of birds as much as a guitar. To isolate one example, the distorted, sandstorm psych onslaught of Mohamed Guitar's ""banjey"" (banjey is a form, not a title), is pretty easy for anyone to understand.</p>
<p><i>Wallahi Le Zein</i> is somewhat similar to a Sublime Frequencies radio or field recording release, except that this has a much deeper interest in the musicological, historical, and cultural underpinnings of what's going on here. Lavoie isn't just putting this stuff out there for you-- the liner notes are an educational document reflecting years of research and real, focused passion for the subject matter, rather than a basic interest in otherness. This is in some ways this compilation's greatest gift-- this is the first curated collection of unfiltered Mauritanian guitar music ever, and I'm glad it's been introduced with such thoroughness and care.</p></div>"|15470.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15470-wallahi-le-zein-wezin-jakwar-and-guitar-boogie-from-the-islamic-republic-of-mauritania/|8.0|Joe Tangari

Was it producer Frank Black? Argos himself? Jasper ""the Dolphin"" Future? Did anybody actually think the problem with Art Brut was all the talking? I rather thought that was like the whole point. Granted, you either love the talking-singing thing or you hate it (see also: the Hold Steady), but at least it was their <i>thing</i>. And beyond being totally, instantly recognizable, it wasn't all that bad of a look for Art Brut, either: Argos' witty, conversational lyrics were always well served by his spoken delivery, offset by the band's playfully slick rock session band chops. But now Argos has gone from ranting about halting a make-out session to turn up a pop song, to singing (scarcely), ""I want to be played in the background while couples drink their wine/ That would be a triumph with a voice like mine/ Everybody wants to feel sexy sometimes/ I can make it happen with a voice like mine.""</p>
<p>Well, at least he hasn't lost his wry sense of humor. But about this newfound singing business: Argos has discovered a voice that sounds a bit like Jarvis Cocker's, only if he'd lost it after a long night out drinking-- a little hoarse, whispering low so as not to upset the hangover. So the album opens with what might as well be its mission statement, ""Clever Clever Jazz"", a typically dry-humored song about a band punching above its weight: ""Sorry that it doesn't sound like it's planned... can't you see we're doing the best that we can?"" Next is another entry into the band's ""Weekend"" trilogy (now extended, Douglas Adams-like, to four songs if you count B-side ""Really Bad Weekend""), ""Lost Weekend"", and while it's as clever and sweet as any of its predecessors, Argos' intonation doesn't exactly do it any extra favors.</p>
<p>Some songs work fine with the singing: The above-quoted ballad ""Sexy Sometimes"" succeeds by dint of making Argos' very struggle the subject of its gently plodding fun, as does ""Is Dog Eared"" to some degree. And then halfway through the album, it seems like even Argos has started to think all this is a bad idea, reverting back for the remainder to his old patterns of speech and shouting.</p>
<p>The results are, unsurprisingly, some of the album's strongest songs, largely because Argos just gets out of the way of his own lyrics. ""Martin Kemp Welch Five A-Side Football Rules!"" is a scorcher, covering the familiar Art Brut territories of football and unrequited schoolboy crushes. ""Axel Rose"" raucously praises its subject as being the sort of guy you'd want in your corner when giving the world the finger. Maybe best of this side is ""Sealand"", ending the album on a drifting note, a dream of starting a sovereign nation of two at sea that affectingly flips the motto of <i>It's a Bit Complicated</i> standout ""People in Love"": ""People in love lie around and get fat/ I didn't want us to end up like that.""</p>
<p>In all this talk about talking, the band Argos originally hired through an ad in the back pages of the <i>NME</i> gets short shrift. But trust that they still sound very much like a band hired from the back pages of the <i>NME</i>: competent rock hands with equal flair for squealing guitar solos and pop backing vocals, easy showmen but not exactly showy. Basically, they punch their weight, and they do it quite well-- sorry to say, but their frontman-turned-singer might want to follow their example.</p></div>"|15417.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15417-brilliant-tragic/|5.5|Eric Grandy

Instead, it's almost certainly a nod to Casablanca Records, one of the most prominent labels of the 1970s. While it did sign the likes of Cher, Kiss, and Parliament, Casablanca was best known as a haven for disco artists, including Donna Summer, Giorgio Moroder, Santa Esmeralda, Village People, and a deep roster of one- and no-hit wonders. It's even rumored that Steve Guttenberg's character in the Village People film <i>Can't Stop the Music</i> was based on Casablanca founder Neil Bogart (no relationship to Humphrey).</p>
<p>It's no shock that Agebjörn would invoke this bellwether of pop history for his latest album. He is one of several Swedish producers enamored with various American and European strains of disco, and his two albums with Sally Shapiro reveal a steadfast belief that heartache is best conveyed via soft vocals, shimmery synths, modulated bass lines, and pulsating beats. <i>Casablanca Nights</i> is his chance to play curator as well as producer, hand-picking such acts as Shapiro, CFCF, Friday Bridge, and Le Prix. The album plays like a label sampler you might dig out of the dollar bin and wonder why none of the artists made it bigger.</p>
<p>Despite that title, Agebjörn isn't abandoning his signature Italo disco-derived sound for a more American style. His production remains exquisitely lush and luxuriant. On ""The Last Day of Summer"", the relatively robust vocals by Queen of Hearts stand out on the album, and it's too bad she doesn't appear more often. Many of the vocalists blur together over the course of <i>Casablanca Nights</i>, although Shapiro remains Agebjörn's most captivating muse, her expressive vocals illuminating each one of her songs.</p>
<p>Most of Agebjörn's songs create the same sort of yearning, thumping dancefloor melancholy, differentiated more by their lyrics than by their instrumentation or their tone. As <i>Casablanca Nights</i> makes its way to morning, he introduces a few new sounds and tricks, to varying degrees of success. ""Alice"", a collaboration with Le Prix, Fred Ventura, and Shapiro, is the most intriguing detour, drumming in some new wave influences from the early 1980s to counterbalance the 1970s sounds. Thanks to the halting chorus and the dynamic boy-girl vocals, the combination of styles is intriguing, not only because these two eras have such different concerns but mostly because similar experiments on <i>Casablanca Nights</i> prove much less compelling.</p>
<p>By the time the requisite chill-out closer comes along-- ""Stranger (Chill Remix)"" with Halftone-- Agebjörn has already thoroughly chilled out to a sequence of downtempo songs like ""Le Noir et le Blanc Sur le Piano"" (where Shapiro sings in French) and ""Memories of Satie"" (with CFCF). Intriguing in their reach if not necessarily their execution, those two numbers weigh down the second half, such that ""Stranger"" doesn't sound like the sunrise to end <i>Casablanca Nights</i>, but an abrupt finale that plays to a long-empty dancefloor. Granted, Agebjörn's intention isn't historical re-creation or even dance-party endurance, but a kind of musical evocation that opens up more conceptual possibilities than perhaps he's willing to explore. Yet, this time-machine quality means the music serves similar purposes to its influences: The songs are meant to be immersive, enveloping, and most of all transportive. Where disco went far beyond mere escapism in the 1970s, <i>Casablanca Nights</i> only gets you out of 2011 for a few sweet minutes.</p></div>"|15394.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15394-casablanca-nights/|6.7|Stephen M.

Though he founded the band in 1999 and issued four rough-and-raw black metal blasts two years later, he didn't properly debut Alcest until 2005, with the two-track, 27-minute EP <i>Le Secret</i>. After 2001's <i>Tristesse Hivernale</i>, he'd realized that direct black metal wouldn't allow him to communicate the intimacy of his ideas, so on <i>Le Secret</i>, a typhoon of blast beats and tremolo guitar essentially created a cocoon for his delicate French voice. Long passages of gentle drift-- birdcalls, operatic introductions, quietly galloping guitars-- surrounded those bits of fury.</p>
<p>Those perpetually nested sounds were, it turns out, the musical manifestations of things Neige had seen in adolescent dreams: ""Since my childhood, I've had the impression of being in contact with a luminous, far-off country. I have named it trivially 'Fairy Land,'"" he explained <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/alcestfra/blog"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in a 2006 interview</a>. ""My goal with Alcest is to transpose in musique my memories of this Fairy Land... beyond all terrestrial and real beauty.""</p>
<p>Neige recently re-recorded those early tracks with full-time Alcest drummer Winterhalter; Prophecy Productions combined the retakes with the original recordings, reissuing the long out-of-print work in five distinct editions. There are two versions of the vinyl LP, the standard jewel case CD, and a version of the disc encased in cloth and a heavy cardboard sleeve. For the Alcest obsessive, one version even puts the cloth-and-cardboard disc inside an engraved wooden box with a key, a handwritten lyrics sheet from Neige, a brooch, and a few ivy leaves, ostensibly plucked from the boughs of Fairy Land. Pressed in an edition of 500, that disc costs just less than $75.</p>
<p>The new takes on the two old songs-- ""Le Secret"" and ""Elévation""-- closely mirror their forebears in structure and style. Both the production and volume are enhanced, with the lonely guitar notes and bass mumbles at the start of the title track now sounding less like separate whispers. The drums are bigger and, thanks to Winterhalter, they're bolder, often pulling away from the relentless blasts Neige once played by himself. Winterhalter's the better rock drummer, adding nuance and flash where his boss once simply bored forward. The new versions are better at being pretty, too, especially during ""Elévation"". Here, Neige sends spectral harmonies floating through a tense electric guitar matrix, and, for the first time, it indeed sounds like a dreamland. In that same 2006 interview, Neige understandably balked when asked about the ""sinister mode"" of the vocals. Here, you'd have a hard time making that misinterpretation. This is <i>Le Secret</i> as it's always been, then, just emboldened and improved by the experience and expansion of Alcest.</p>
<p>Still, it's hard to hear this second iteration of <i>Le Secret</i> and not be at least a bit skeptical about its cash-in nature. These aren't radical reinventions or even vast improvements on the originals, which, though long out-of-print, have long been available for download online. Even if those first recordings sounded more rudimentary or rushed, the first <i>Le Secret</i> succeeded with the same sidewinding, ultra-dynamic structures and mix of brutality and beauty found on this version. These re-recordings succeed only in upping the production and performance value, not in documenting how they funnel directly into the later (and better) songs on 2007's fine <i>Souvenirs d'un Autre Monde </i>or 2010's brilliant<i> Écailles de lune</i>.</p>
<p>Sure, this retrench proves that Neige has developed as a guitarist and vocalist, and that, with the addition of Winterhalter, Alcest have improved as a band. But you could hear that much throughout <i>Écailles de lune</i>, not to mention Neige's progression as a composer and arranger. Indeed, over the last half-decade, he's become better at building transitions and at creating spaces where disparate ideas sit naturally with each other. <i>Le Secret</i>'s shifts between bird calls and black metal, between roar and repose, felt rushed and uneven in 2005; in 2011, despite how much Alcest have progressed since that start, they still feel that way. They just sound better doing it.</p></div>"|15467.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15467-le-secret-ep/|6.0|Grayson Currin

There are shots of tall grass and wild flowers and berries, as well as the insects whose drone provides a segue to the song's forthcoming hum. It works really well. A Lull are a Chicago outfit that specialize in rangy, wildly percussive indie pop that takes a lot of its rhythmic cues from Sigur Rós' most recent LP, 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11924-me-su-i-eyrum-vi-spilum-endalaust/"" target=""_blank""><i>Með suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust</i></a> (translation: ""With a buzz in our ears we play endlessly""), as well as that of frontman Jónsi's 2010 solo outing, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14098-go/"" target=""_blank""><i>Go</i></a>. Both of those records demonstrated the Icelanders' transition into more contained pop formats, though the kineticism of <i>Go</i> in particular is the better jumping off point. Like this wide-open field, it was a record alive at every turn. A Lull seem to be in similar pursuit, tripping up only in figuring out a way to squeeze it all into song form.</p>
<p>Much of what's to be heard on <i>Confetti</i> scans as a series of thoroughly fleshed-out vocal and rhythmic exercises, many of them so similar they congeal into one. Take for instance the blippy rumble of ""Dark Stuff"" or that of ""Some Love"" just before it. While the rhythms and drum sounds vary slightly from one another, the vocal acrobatics of frontman Nigel Evan Dennis tend to glue everything together in an oddly disjointed manner. Elsewhere, ""Pregnancy"" takes on an industrial punch that still seems to sound of a piece with ""Spread It All Around"". This, despite the many angles from which he attacks them. From end to end, Dennis delivers a tireless performance: he darts, he dives, he dips, he sprinkles syllables in fizzy staccato and/or he smears them across a song in breathy fashion. Little of this done without an added layer of processing.</p>
<p>While it's clear a lot the textures here have been calibrated just so, the aggressive manner in which this crew opted to produce the record makes for a flat, synthetic sheen that takes a lot away from the multi-dimensional sound multiple drummers can provide. A few years back a North Carolina band made an online splash approaching Animal Collective's pre-<i>Strawberry Jam</i> energy with ears still steeped in a decade's worth of pop-punk and post-emo crunch. The result was bombastic and colorful, but it was also polished in a way that belied the freeform, organic nature of what they seemed to be chasing. That band was Annuals, and A Lull, sonic kin in a lot of ways, have gone a similar route this time out. There are no shortage of interesting directions in which to take music like this. But to package it in a way that strips it of its dynamism, is a good way to shackle it, too.</p></div>"|15466.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15466-confetti/|5.9|David Bevan

While <i>It Was Easy</i> was clearly written by an accomplished, pop-smart musician, its gentle eclecticism and mild singer-songwriter indulgences made it feel a little too clean and calculated. With <i>In Blank</i>, Davis has tapped into something vital that even the best backing band can't automatically afford: confidence.</p>
<p><i>In Blank</i> is, for the most part, a raucous blast of power-pop, its mono recording nicely balancing the inherent tunefulness of these fast-paced, quick-tempered songs. The first third of the album boasts a blur of high-energy cuts that shake with the tenuous endurance of <i>Hearts of Oak</i>-era Ted Leo. Despite being jammed with memorable hooks (the sneering shoutability of the excellent ""Turn Your Face"") and riffs (the elastic guitar that snaps all over ""Light Sleepers""), these songs work thanks to their continuity (and the constant pogo of Cotterman's bass). Sounding as if they were all meticulously rehearsed and then recorded in one breathless, blurry streak, their energy feels infinite.</p>
<p>But, alas, Davis falls into humdrum Elvis Costello homage on the album's sagging middle section. Davis has a lot in common with Costello vocally, so it's not as if he can't hold his own-- but the songs themselves either meander a little too much (""All Tricks"") or seem like flimsy Xeroxes. Not to mention, when stationed next to those tight-wound first 11 minutes, they dissolve from memory, feeling like an unfortunate step backwards.</p>
<p>Luckily, Davis shares a certain kinship with another power-pop legend, New Pornographer Carl Newman. ""No Air"", which takes pot shots at ""artists whose real skill, fleeting or not, is that they don't have anything to say,"" has a fire in its belly reminiscent of early Pornos, while ""Cain and the Twigs"" carries some of the bright, simply stated hallmarks of Newman's solo debut, <i>The Slow Wonder</i>. These are strong tracks that showcase Davis' firm handle of sharply orchestrated pop, but ultimately,<i> In Blank</i>'s songwriting peters out a little. If Davis can continue to find the courage he frequently taps into here, he could cut it even looser next time.</p></div>"|15438.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15438-in-blank/|6.9|Zach Kelly

In the past 15 years, the Japanese trio has released more than 20 albums of heavy eclecticism-- stoner bludgeons and thrash blasts, dense drones and noise screes. They're the band with Atsuo-- the screaming, gong-banging drummer with one of those arena-rock, hands-off microphones-- and Takeshi, a multi-instrumentalist who plays a double-necked guitar so often and well that it doesn't seem like an affectation. Michio Kurihara, one of the world's best psychedelic guitarists, works as Boris' touring sideman. From former labelmates Sunn O))) to fellow Japanese sonic explorers Merzbow and Keiji Haino, they've also collaborated with a long list of experimental luminaries. All of this seems to be part and parcel to Boris' methodical quest to build a legacy of expansive, new heavy music, where no form is too sacred to break, no idea too mainstream to incorporate. If that's their plan, it's largely worked.</p>
<p>Accordingly, there are few release-day gestures more rock star than issuing two albums at the same time, as Boris will do with the slight electropop-and-shoegaze departure <i>Attention Please</i> and the requisite metal grab bag<i> Heavy Rocks</i>. What's more, this is the second Boris LP to sport the title <i>Heavy Rocks</i>; the first was released in 2002, and nearly a decade later, it still stands as one of Boris' best efforts, a landmark distillation of stoner metal and noise rock built with enviable precision and aggression. This moment, then, is not only Boris' look-how-popular-we-are exclamation but also their look-how-much-we've-grown assertion; essentially, <i>Attention Please</i> and <i>Heavy</i> (<i>Heavier</i>?) <i>Rocks</i> are logical next steps for the Boris legacy. But riddled as this pair of albums is with confounding musical indecision and listless stylistic repetition, they mostly serve as reminders of how remarkable and inventive Boris have been and often threaten to be. <i>Heavy Rocks</i> was sturdier back in 2002, while the appropriately titled <i>Attention Please</i>-- even if the more interesting of these two discs-- is a flimsy showcase for Boris guitarist Wata as a would-be college-rock frontwoman.</p>
<p><i>Heavy Rocks</i> does the things you expect a Boris album to do: It explodes open with ""Riot Sugar"", a brutal blues-metal march with a rote, ragged riff and background grunts from the Cult's Ian Astbury. ""Missing Pieces"" alternates between spare guitar drift, gnarls of noise, and an epically forlorn crescendo, while the other 12-minute-plus tune, ""Aileron"", growls and swells before drifting off into a piano-and-distortion haze. For fans of Boris, the material is a double-edged sword: It's the sort of motley metal that brought you to the fold one way or another, but that means you've already heard it-- all of it, from the massive soundscapes on<i> Pink</i> to the dynamic sizzle in <i>Amplifier Worship-- </i>several times before. Here, it's all offered like a mixtape, with no narrative arch or musical momentum.</p>
<p><i>Attention Please</i> at least offers something fresh for Boris. For the first time in the band's long run, Wata takes lead vocal. Her consistent presence offers an atmosphere of patience, plus a cohesiveness that Boris have long since foregone. Sure, she leads the band through several different looks, from the tense, pretty opening title track to the dance-metal anthem ""Party Boy"". During ""See You Next Week"", she drifts like a ghost between a world of broken drum machines and guitars meant more for texture than melody. There's a ruminative instrumental for acoustic guitar, and ""Spoon"", a blustery tumble that-- Wata's willowy vocals aside-- favorably suggests the sound of 1990s American modern rock radio. What's best, the trio doesn't give up on its heavy metal experience; though this album suggests a stylistic mix of new wave and Mazzy Star, Boris play with the rumble and roar of a loud rock band. The bass line during the chiming ""Tokyo Wonder Land"" is a menacing throb, the guitar solo an acid-damaged roar. ""Les Paul Custom '86"" emerges as a dance number through sheets of noise, anchored by a riff that would have fit Earth in 1993. Those tell-all touches and Wata's command suggest that this is the better, if unforeseen, avenue for Boris' future. Though not fully developed, this is a space where they might actually explore without the constraints of reputation and expectation.</p>
<p>The heavy metal landscape of 2011 is tailor-made for (and, sort of, by) Boris. Sure, the black metal kids are busy retrenching against boundary breakers like Liturgy and Altar of Plagues, and a whole lot of older burly bros will tell you that stoner, thrash, and melodramatic metal were done better the first time. They're not necessarily wrong, but those sorts of attitudes provide a welcome contrast for the tone of inclusion and acceptance for ideas that permeates not only some of the moment's most exciting metal but also music at large. Whether it's the elegiac folk singer heading for stacks of finely orchestrated keyboards or the black metal band backing its melee with a pure and purposed disco-punk throb, a whole crop of young acts now seem open to the possibilities within their forms. Their audiences largely seem interested in tagging along, too. After all, we obtain and hear music in radically different ways and contexts now than in 1996, when Boris were making their recorded debut as a noisy sludge-metal band from Tokyo. Boris' post-modern eclecticism is, in theory, perfect for this moment. But pastiches and piss-takes-- by and large, the sort of material that's scattered between <i>Attention Please</i> and the second <i>Heavy Rocks-- </i>can only satisfy so much. Boris seem to be racing to stay current, to show that they can change as rapidly as these hyper-wired times. With each new addition to a catalog that's becoming more adulterated each year, we're learning that maybe they can't.</p></div>"|15460.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15460-attention-please-heavy-rocks/|7.1|Grayson Currin

Adolescent and slightly post-adolescent males-- their anger, humor, ennui, cruelty, sensitivity, and self-pity-- have been scrutinized by all manner of thinkpiece-penners and armchair sociologists.</p>
<p>A measure of each of those qualities is present in the bratty Brit-punk trio Let's Wrestle and its sophomore effort, <i>Nursing Home</i>. Led by singer and songwriter Wesley Patrick Gonzalez, this band of early twentysomethings comprehensively captures the mindset of young men kicking and screaming against their inevitable transition into adulthood. Musically the group strikes a familiar slacker balance between being engaging and slapdash. Punky 1990s influences abound, running the gamut from Green Day to Supergrass to Weezer, highlighted by some wonderfully melodic lines from bassist Mike Lightning. In general spirit, Let's Wrestle slot neatly alongside those bands as well as recent English groups like the Libertines, Arctic Monkeys, and Art Brut.</p>
<p>Much like many of their forebears, these kids also make humor out of idle bullshit-- opener ""In Dreams Part II"" imagines a nighttime phantasmagoria that includes ""two Greek men fighting in a pharmacy"" and a guy bragging about having slept with Queen Victoria. Yet their jokes are also sometimes tinged with meanness-- witness ""Bad Mammaries"", a sour screed against an overly lascivious middle-aged lady. At the same time, Let's Wrestle are capable of tenderness. ""If I Keep on Loving You"" and ""I Am Useful"" are winsome pop songs; meanwhile, ""For My Mother"" expresses true empathy for its titular subject, as Gonzalez and his mates sonically make their most pronounced evocation of Weezer.</p>
<p>For the most part, however, you get a snapshot of irresponsible young dudes not giving a fuck, Peter Pans wanting to be boys forever. A few of the songs nail the attitude with their titles alone: ""I'm So Lazy"", ""I Will Not Give In"", and ""I Forgot"". Most fascinating though is ""In the Suburbs"", which finds Gonzalez idealizing a life where ""I'll have dinner with my mother and play computer games all night."" Certainly it's fair to read the song as tongue-in-cheek, but Let's Wrestle also do a really good job of convincing you that they have pretty intimate knowledge of that coddled, layabout lifestyle. These are entirely representative growing pains from a group of kids who seem convinced that being a full-on adult means you might as well be in a <i>Nursing Home</i>.</p></div>"|15462.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15462-nursing-home/|6.7|Joshua Love

One's on guitar and vocals; the other mans the drums.  They also co-run Infinity Cat Recordings with their father, singer/songwriter Robert Ellis Orrall, the only man in the world that can say he wrote songs for Shenandoah and Lindsay Lohan.  JEFF's been an ongoing concern since 2002, but the brothers Orrall have logged time in plenty of bands, including the earliest incarnation of Be Your Own Pet.  Like Pet, JEFF was fond of the fuzzy spastic two-to-three-minute punk-pop tune, but they were also fond of being unpredictable.  Jamin and Jake were just as likely to say their peace in 30 seconds as they were to stretch things out for 14 minutes.</p>
<p>After numerous tours and releases, 2009's <i>Heavy Days</i> saw the Orralls focusing their powers and presenting themselves as an economy-sized psych-rock outfit, an Eagles of Death Metal with one less mouth to feed and a lot more pot in the glove compartment.  Big and heavy but still quick on its feet, <i>Heavy Days</i> was a step forward that could please both longtime fans and those new to the party.</p>
<p>That said, anyone who's been tracking the moves the Orralls have made might be thrown off a bit by the way <i>We Are the Champions</i> kicks off, and I'm not talking about the rap-radio-exclusive airhorn that sounds off at the start of ""Hey Friend"". It's the song proper, and its remarkable similarity to what good Weezer sounds like, which might surprise.  Everything about the tune-- its loping mid-tempo cadence, Jake Orrall's Cuomo-like vocals, even the tune's simple-simon sentiments (""I've been thinking about your mom/ You can tell me if it's really wrong"")-- makes it sound like a Weezer Blue Album demo.  Some might see that as a step backwards for JEFF, but I mean that comparison as a complement.  The tune's aw-shucks silliness is as charming as its earworm of a melody is inescapable.</p>
<p>There's a fair amount of <i>Heavy Days</i>' brand of amp damage to be found on <i>Champions</i>-- you'll want to skip to ""Cool Out"" or ""Ripper"" to get that fix-- and one sitar-flecked tune (""Health and Strength"") that'd fit right in on a Thee Oh Sees album, but the aforementioned poppier M.O. is the way the majority of this album goes.  ""Bummer"" was JEFF's contribution to a split single with Best Coast, but plenty of tunes from <i>Champions</i>, from the gently rumbling ""Diamond Way"" to the awkwardly confident ""Wastoid Girl"", could stand toe-to-toe with anything Best Coast had to offer.  It's only fitting that this album signals the beginning of a business partnership between Infinity Cat and the Warner Music Group.  <i>We Are the Champions</i> might disappoint some diehard fans, but it's also proof positive that JEFF the Brotherhood can play with the big boys.</p></div>"|15452.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15452-we-are-the-champions/|7.3|David Raposa

They seem to stay for the entirety of the song. That's a testament to this North Dakota outfit's fondness for atmosphere, something they've managed to spread out evenly across all 11 of these 1960s-indebted harmonizers. ""Pebbles"", as if by design, sounds like it was recorded for transistor radio play. The bass is dewey. The harmonies are starlit. The theremin is ripe. And then there's the matter of MJ Parker's opening line: ""Pebbles, it's time to go home now/ The drag race is over/ You smashed up your car, and now our dream is over."" It's all draped in a nice, light fuzz.</p>
<p>But as Real Estate, for example, use pools of reverb to give their songs their own sort of submerged ambiance, Secret Cities line their more contemporary sensibilities with a layer of fuzz for similar reasons. In this case, it's not at all about obfuscation and more in the service of added warmth. Some of that can be attributed to their decision to record <i>Strange Hearts</i> in the basement of a recently abandoned bank in Kansas City, but most of it's in the citrus-splashed feel of their songwriting. Opener ""Always Friends"" kicks things off with a light-footed guitar melody that-- just after they lace their second verse with some well-managed whistling-- gains strength as it goes. At the moment, Secret Cities find themselves in a lane with the Morning Benders and Grizzly Bear, the latter a band whose music, in juxtaposition, has a big brother-like energy to it.</p>
<p>That's because in contrast, these three seem to have taken a less agressively tailored approach to tapping similar veins of the 60s. As they are on ""Pebbles"" or the shuffle of ""Love Crime"", Secret Cities live and die by period-specific vocal harmonies, as mastered early on by the Zombies and Shangri-La's, just to name a couple. But Parker and fellow vocalist Charlie Gokey, both with well-suited cords for this kind of stuff, enjoy a great deal of verve in the manic rhythms of Alex Abnos. The racket they're able to muster together in the process is enough to set them apart from the pack. A song like ""Ice Cream Scene"" takes a few hairpin turns before settling into a two-minute breakdown outro that's assertive and rambunctious enough to belie their twee-est of tendencies. Elsewhere, ""Brief Encounter"" metes out psychedelic fare that's equally muscular. Organs bounce. Voice entwines. Horns march in. It could signal a parade just as easily as a funeral. Lively atmosphere either way.</p></div>"|15457.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15457-strange-hearts/|7.4|David Bevan

They've played almost every basement within a 10-mile radius of the Willamette River. In addition to recently touring with hometown heroes the Thermals, they book their own tours. They forego studio time in favor of bedroom and basement recording. They even own their own small-run cassette label, <a href=""http://www.gnartapesandshit.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gnar Tapes and Shit</a>. As a band, all hallmarks of sophistication are pushed straight through a closed window; White Fang are mostly about gleeful destruction and infectious cacophony. As the title of this album concretely suggests, <i>Grateful to Shred</i> does not look to transform the band's M.O. to something more nuanced.</p>
<p><i>Grateful to Shred</i>'s greatest asset is its youthful vigor, which is manifested in a number of ways throughout the album's eleven tracks. ""Sooner or later, gonna wind up dead,"" shouts frontman Erik Gage over the Camaro-rock of the album's title track, as if to explain the mentality behind his band's righteous thrash. ""Small Amp"" and ""Messy"" are would-be garage-rock anthems, while ""Beatles of Death"" plays as the younger brother (or maybe even the son) of the Misfits and most of the acts on SST. The awesomely named ""Fuck Up a Fascist (I'm Down)"" contains menacing guitar work and a chant during the first verse that sounds a lot like ""Google that shit"" if you're not paying close enough attention. The second verse of ""Not Listening"" finds Gage shifting from childlike coo to cracked lunacy in the turn of a single phrase that any post-adolescent can relate to: ""I was thinking 'bout sleep/ AND HOW I DON'T NEED IT,"" voice crazed and breaking while forcing out the second line. The hilariously comical ""Can't Find My Weed"" sounds like what would probably happen if Afroman hijacked your teenage neighbor's garage-pop band; sure, it's jokey, but the fun is contagious.</p>
<p>For all of the band's punk primitivism, <i>Grateful to Shred</i> also occasionally diverts from that formula. ""Funny Disguises"" follows the lead of Marnie Stern in trying to make fingertapping cool again, while ""Gnar Shred""-- a remake of a freakout from their 2008 debut LP, <i>Pure Evil</i>-- is a short jaunt featuring just cheap hand drums, tambourines, and anti-harmonized vocals. Though it serves as more of a sketch or interlude than a fully fleshed-out song (just like the original), it manages to still be atonal and defiantly punk (just like the original), and displays the band just having a good time, even though it's entirely unessential as a tune.</p>
<p>Closing track ""Feeling Shitty"" continues the band's proclivity to shirk ambiguously poetic song titles, as Gage sings, ""I woke up today feeling kinda shitty/ Feeling kinda bad for myself,"" over cymbal taps and unreasonably distorted guitar. As all of the instruments explode on their way to the song's end, it feels like a moment of teenage catharsis, as if generating a metric ton of noise is the only way the band can shake off a bummer day. Not only could there not have been a better title for this album than <i>Grateful to Shred</i>, but it's also a testament to why grabbing a bunch of instruments with your friends and creating music-- whether it's in our basements or a $100-an-hour studio-- is so therapeutic for so many of us.</p></div>"|15445.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15445-grateful-to-shred/|7.1|Martin Douglas

Just a warning for all of you who'd gotten used to agonizingly long waits between Bush records. It was easy to hope, when <i>Director's Cut</i> was first announced, that we'd been blessed ahead of schedule with the latest transmission from her private art-rock fairy land. Instead, this is a rethink of a somewhat controversial period in her career, by an artist who claims not to give much thought to her albums once they've been sent to market.</p>
<p><i>Director's Cut</i> transforms songs from 1989's <i>The Sensual World</i> and 1993's <i>The Red Shoes</i>. Sometimes crucial elements (rhythm tracks, vocals) are re-recorded. Some aspects (like certain guest performances) are left unchanged. Occasionally an entire song gets a note-by-note remake. It's a major and unexpected reinvention of familiar and very time-bound material, not quite ""new"" and also not quite what fans have been playing for years now. The very different mix of <i>Director's Cut</i> changes not just the sound but the emotional kick inside many of these songs. What was once the work of a shy woman who came to roaring life on record is now just as often subdued, reflective, inward-looking. It's worthy of standing as its own entry in Bush's discography, without necessarily replacing the albums it draws from.</p>
<p>At the time of its release, <i>The Sensual World</i> seemed both up to date and not of its time. The glossy studio-obsessive production sounded definitely of its moment, fitting for the era of booming drums and reverb-soaked pop trifles from bands like Fine Young Cannibals and INXS. But the songs, and Bush's performances, were stark reminders that she actually came out of the same tradition that gave us the operatic vocals of prog rock, the jazz-tinged complexity of the Canterbury psychedelic scene, the unashamed theatricality that led to Peter Gabriel dressing up like a giant daffodil. It made for a strange hybrid, the smoothness of the Big 80s meets the complexity and expressionism of the prog 70s. Much of the record's tension came from wrapping shiny pop accessibility around songs that might burst into emotionally raw strangeness at any time. Bush played to the moment, but couldn't be contained by it.</p>
<p>By the time of <i>The Red Shoes</i>-- with its prog structures, guest-star guitar heroics, world music touches, all given another dose of pop polish-- Bush's music was too ornate to fit in with the stripped-down ""realness"" of alt-rock. It was also still too defiantly individual to sit alongside the work of her 70s and 80s peers, many of whom had moved into comfortable, profitable, and bland MOR singer-songwriter territory. Her moment hadn't so much passed-- though it'd be hard to point out anyone else making music that sounded like this at the time-- as she'd become a genre-of-one.  The fussed-over textures and genteel folk touches of adult contemporary peeled back mid-song to reveal naked eroticism, rage, joy, Bush's voice spluttering out wordless weirdness or leaping into ecstatic ululations.</p>
<p>What Bush has done on <i>Director's Cut</i>, put simply, is to strip the 80s from these songs. (That goes for the <i>Red Shoes</i> material, too, even though the album was released in the 90s.) The gigantic drums and digital polish, what both dated the music instantly and gave it that stark contrast between accessibility and the deeply personal, have been replaced with less showy rhythm tracks, and a warmer, more intimate atmosphere. On the original ""The Sensual World"", the elements drawn from Celtic folk felt like striking intrusions in an all-digital world. Renamed ""Flower of the Mountain"" here, those rustic elements no longer feel quite so out of place, whether you found the original an intriguing hybrid or an awkward merger of old and new. The songs still don't have the feel of a band playing together, but they have a new unity, even the synthetic elements part of a lovingly handcrafted sound. ""The Red Shoes"", another Celtic-inflected standout, with one of Bush's wildest performances, gains a new intensity precisely <i>because</i> the instruments no longer feel so sterile. But not every element of this patchwork has been pieced together perfectly. The eerie keyboard textures on ""And So Love Is"", the kind of sour 80s kitsch beloved by Gang Gang Dance, seem surprisingly natural in this new environment. But Eric Clapton's bluesy wanking sounds even more out of place now, stadium pop bluster in a homemade world. It produces tension for sure, but the wrong sort.</p>
<p>It's the singing that just as often startles, though. Bush is less show-offy on <i>Director's Cut</i> than any of her pre-hiatus albums. For a woman known for her range, and her fearlessness at using that range, her performances are always tempered and often low-key here. As with so many songs on <i>Director's Cut</i>, ""This Woman's Work"" becomes almost shocking in its difference, not least because it's transformed from one of Bush's biggest showstoppers into something far more mournful, the singer restraining herself as if almost but not quite broken by love. The backing track is just as minimal, but deeper, the instrumental textures less brittle. A hushed, lonely Bush sounds as if she's drifting through a vast, lonely space. But instead of the original's childlike verses surging to grown-ass-woman longing on the choruses, Bush is more evenly paced here, communicating deep regret more through a bereft tone than diva theatrics. It's desolate and intimate, like much of <i>Director's Cut</i>, where the original's bravura made it feel both tender and defiant, like much of Bush's early work.</p>
<p>Even with an older and more reserved Bush occasionally putting the brakes on that melodrama, these reworked songs don't totally relinquish that unashamed grandiosity that makes Bush such a love-hate proposition. <i>Director's Cut</i> provides a unique opportunity to do an A/B comparison between a late-career artist and her younger self. But which you'll prefer likely depends on whether you favor a more assured artist working within her strengths, or a brash younger artist delighting in the defying of pop conventions.</p></div>"|15448.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15448-directors-cut/|7.3|Jess Harvell

I don't say this with any condescension or surprise; cinephilia might as well have supplanted graffiti or b-boying as one of hip-hop's four elements by the time Rae asked Meth where his <i>Killer</i> tape was. But it's clear from all the carefully assembled dialogue clips on <i>Her Favorite Colo(u)r </i>that Blu's interest in movies is just as personal as his ear for neo-backpack production and vibrant everyman-narrative rap. We get clips from <i>Closer</i>, <i>Punch-Drunk Love</i>, <i>Buffalo '66</i>, <i>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</i>-- indie-canon stuff rearranged into a pastiche of troubled romance and teeth-gritting soul-baring. If there's a nerdcore for people who collect Criterion editions, Blu might've dropped its most essential release of the past couple of years.</p>
<p>Catch is, you have to go back those ""past couple of years"" to pinpoint when it was first released. <i>Her Favorite Colo(u)r</i> used to be a free mixtape back in 2009. Now it's an official release that costs the same as any other album you can get via online retailers. It can be dicey to run across an album on the pay-actual-money market a couple of years after it was offered as a no-charge download, and it might be even dicier when the main selling point-- an ostensible ""remaster""-- threatens to defeat the purpose of the original article's charm. But reissue or not, this is the first widely available full-length Blu album to hit stores since he had a couple of great guest verses on the Roots' <i>How I Got Over</i>, and momentum's momentum even if he's advanced a bit stylistically in the two-plus years since this first dropped.</p>
<p>If this release feels a little slight, you could blame its EP length-- roughly 30 minutes. But a more identifiable culprit is Blu as he sounds on the mic-- or under it, or across the room from it, or wherever he is in relation to the mic that half-buries him beneath his own production. Exile collab <i>Below the Heavens </i>and his Mainframe teamup as Johnson&amp;Jonson have proven how engaging he can be at length, spinning narratives where he duels with his own worst personal impulses and pits them against more ground-level, day-to-day concerns. But he doesn't assert himself much here, letting the sampled dialogue pick up the slack between rushed verses and a backgrounded mic presence. Cuts like ""Amnesia"" and ""Since"" have an introspective quality to them, but that does make them a bit less immediate. And if rap is all about performance trumping the page, Blu's lyrics here have the unfortunate tendency to scan a lot better on paper, though at worst that usually just means you'll need another few attentive listens to start catching the highlights.</p>
<p>At least the production does its best to make that task worthwhile. Aside from the whole Sundance vibe, the main draw of <i>Her Favorite Colo(u)r </i>is its dusty, lived-in feel, familiar loops of Billie Holiday and Jimi Hendrix and Curtis Mayfield worn threadbare and distorted into shitty-speaker resonance. And the remaster doesn't radically alter the album's original character for bad or good-- the bass is a bit crisper and richer, but the lo-fi dying-transistor/janky phonograph atmospherics of his production still register the most vividly. It's not the most revolutionary stuff; these dusty soul loops and chopped-up vocal refrains aren't as timely (or as polarizing) as the junglist <i>Galaga </i>headrush of Flying Lotus' beat for Blu's recent single ""Everything's OK"". But the lovesick noir vibe is compelling in the right mindset-- maybe humidity, alcohol, and regret are crucial prerequisites to getting the most out of it, but hip-hop production hasn't nailed the feel of scratched Formica bar-tops and dingy jukeboxes this well since the more reflective moments of <i>Madvillainy</i>. Cop this if you haven't, revisit it if you have, and consider it the Super 8 short-subject prequel to what should hopefully be a widescreen feature-length future breakthrough.</p></div>"|15429.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15429-her-favorite-colour/|7.0|Nate Patrin

But there's a whole subset of club music that dedicates itself to the inverse of what we're expected to seek amidst a sweating, heaving crowd-- loneliness, terror, misery, dread. This isn't a new phenomenon; Simon Reynolds has written of how the collective serotonin depletion that followed Britain's acid house effusions turned breakbeat hardcore and drum 'n' bass down darker paths. That music, at least, continued to engage the body, as does its direct descendant, dubstep, thanks to breakneck tempos and spleen-crushing bass.</p>
<p>Enter Andy Stott. The Manchester-based DJ and producer is no stranger to dance music of the most visceral kind. In the latter half of the 2000s, he was best known for steely, speaker-destroying dub techno. Recently, especially under the pseudonym Andrea, he's tried his hand at shuddering, breakbeat-fueled dubstep and 160-BPM juke. But on a new album for Modern Love, he reinterprets techno in dirge-like fashion, slowed to a funereal shuffle and weighted down by a lead blanket of reverb. The term ""death disco"" has never felt so apt.</p>
<p>It's a modest album, just six tracks and a short, introductory sketch-- some 33 minutes in total. It's the tempos that you notice first: his 4/4 thump moves sluggishly, like a 12"" 45 spun at 33 or even slower. House and techno usually lope along at somewhere between 120 and 130 beats per minute; Stott paces his tracks at 100, 90, even 80 BPM. Forget ""peak-time"" club music: these are trough-time beats. And it's not just a question of speed; every sound is warbly and unstable, like a warped record pitched way, way down. Handclaps and hi-hats crumble into bit-crushed detritus; kick drums and bass frequencies turn to a jellied slush, like solid ground liquefies during earthquakes.</p>
<p>The murky sonics often recall Philip Jeck, who uses vintage turntables with a 16-RPM setting to attain an otherworldly rumble. On a couple of tracks, ethereal female vocals float hazily over the top; ""Execution"" is suffused with a gravelly death gurgle that wouldn't be out of place on a Sunn O))) record. A pervasive hiss and crackle drives home the idea that we're trawling the depths of vinyl's pockmarked grooves, like one of those microscopic photos that turns a record into a lunar landscape.</p>
<p>Dissonance makes it even more hair-raising. ""North to South"" plunges darkly careening tones-- a Doppler-effect buzz with the skid of braked vinyl-- through bright, queasy synthesizers. (Kompakt fans may hear an echo of Wolfgang Voigt's M:I:5 project.) ""Intermittent"" revels in the seams as it patches together strings, bells, and vocal fragments into a rough-cut collage. In the song's last few bars, you can hear Stott's debt to disco edits as he finally lets a tightly cropped loop unfurl into a full phrase of music that, sped up, is recognizable as 90s R&amp;B.</p>
<p>Only one track doesn't fit the mold: ""Dark Details"", which throbs at dubstep's quickened pulse. Still, even here, the percussion's muted clang gives the impression of hearing a rave piped in via plumbing-- some club, miles away, suddenly bubbling up from your sink, and stinking of muck. Like a counterbalance to its uncharacteristically spry tempo, ""Dark Details"" is followed by the slowest tracks on the album, the demonic ""Execution"" and the torpid ""Passed Me By"", a song so bleak it could make Burial look optimistic by comparison.</p>
<p>Ah yes, Burial: you couldn't not mention him, really. Burial's haunted melancholy certainly paved the way for Stott's even more despondent take on dance music, and Stott is hardly alone in his doomsayer's approach. You can hear similar sounds and affect in Shackleton, Raime, Holy Other, and in moments of Demdike Stare, a project of Stott's label-mate Miles Whittaker. But where Burial and Shackleton use the flickering syncopations of dubstep and garage to keep their music moving, Stott's 4/4 beats, reduced to a deathly crawl, give his music an even more hopeless cast. ""Drag,"" the name associated with Salem's style of music, would be apropos-- suggestive, as it is, of a body being towed, or a boulder pushed uphill. Where club culture mythologizes a circuit of endless nights and after-parties, <i>Passed Me By</i> suggests physical and spiritual exhaustion, Sisyphus collapsing beneath the dead-eyed twinkle of the disco ball.</p></div>"|15447.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15447-passed-me-by/|7.6|Philip Sherburne

You may recognize his name as one of a few contributors to Björk's <i>Medulla</i>, where he served as both a co-writer and remix artist. Or, you might have heard the score he provided for 2009's <i>Last Train Home</i>, a well-received Chinese film about a family of peasants journeying to be reunited. Both are good contextual examples when approaching Alary's work as Ensemble, a project in which he marries elements of film score and classical music to more experimental avenues. It's a note he hits early in <i>Excerpts</i>, his latest. As ""Opening"" opens, Alary arranges for what feel like great orchestral sighs and groans, violins that dance above a layer of low-end that recalls the Montreal post-rock of Godspeed You! Black Emperor. That dichotomy between flight and discord makes for music whose axis is constantly being flipped, whose focal point is always shifting. It's disorienting listening of a very specific type.</p>
<p class=""p2"">It's often that music so fit for film suffers without a visual compliment. That's not the case with <i>Excerpts</i>. Alary's work here holds up well on its own, though it's not a record with a whole lot of replay value. Take for instance the many stages of ""Things I Forget"", a piece that stops to change direction several times within its own five-minute running time. ""They come, they go, things I collect,"" sings Darcy Conroy, whose vocals appear often here, both in French and English. ""Gathered en masse, spilled from the drawers, estimating the past."" It's an image echoed both by <i>Excerpts</i>' cluttered cover art as well as the overarching concept Alary threads throughout the record. As he and Conroy conclude warring spoken word passages at this song's jarring midpoint, it finds a new melodic thread to carry it home, the very same that Alary recycles for the title track's bedrock in the album's second half.</p>
<p class=""p2"">It's a clever attempt attempt at what feels like musical deja vu. Alary designed <i>Excerpts</i> to feature a host of trapdoors and moving walls that connect to one another both conceptually and musically. The glowing tympani of ""En attendant l'orage"" could very well be a link to the atonal needling and cinematic whoosh of ""Valse des objets trouves"". Or how about the strings of ""November 22nd"", which Alary writes to mimic the blare of Martin Horns, more commonly known as European sirens. Just as soon as that sound makes itself familiar, Alary pairs it with the real thing. There are instances like these smartly arranged throughout. Holistically, they combine to form an album that interacts with itself on a number of levels. While it brandishes a certain kind of insular brilliance, it's music more ripe for conversation or think pieces than headphones or the living room hi-fi.</p></div>"|15456.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15456-excerpts/|6.3|David Bevan

Boucher's music draws upon a diverse collection of influences (Panda Bear, Salem, Alicia Keys) as she experiments with eerie loops and a stratospheric falsetto. (She <a href=""http://www.dummymag.com/new-music/2010/08/21/grimes-interview-so-many-worlds-/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">says</a> that while recording last year's otherworldly <i>Halfaxa</i>, she ""practiced"" singing in four octaves by listening to Mariah's ""Heartbreaker"".) While Grimes' previous work found her burying her poppier inclinations beneath dense atmospherics and moody textures, her material on <i>Darkbloom</i> melds all of her impulses into a coherent and confident sound, resulting into some of her strongest tracks to date.</p>
<p>For Grimes, <i>Darkbloom</i> comes on the heels of a prolific 2010. She released two solid LPs: the melodic and intimate debut <i>Geidi</i> <i>Primes</i>, and the darker, more unified <i>Halfaxa</i>. The latter could be classified as bubblegum macabre; songs like ""Weregild"" and ""Sagrad Прекрасный"" somehow suggested the skeletons from Daft Punk's ""Around the World"" video singing Tiffany songs on karaoke night. I liked <i>Geidi Primes</i> even better, a record that filtered the confessional intimacy of lo-fi bedroom pop (as on the standout track ""Rosa"") through influences including dubstep to synth pop. Boucher's tendency to throw everything in the pot occasionally came off as a lack of unity, but I found its aesthetic miscellany to be one of her debut's charms. ""Everybody thinks I'm boring,"" she sang in a mock-confessional tone on ""Zoal, Face Dancer""-- a sentiment that nobody who heard the record could possibly agree with.</p>
<p><i>Darkbloom</i>, though, announces Grimes' arrival as an avant-pop force. This is largely thanks to the single best song she's ever done, ""Vanessa"", which channels Lykke Li by way of a blissed-out Donna Summer reverie. ""Crystal Ball"", perhaps her most upbeat song yet, is also a stunner. Both tracks display a new, cleaner aesthetic for Grimes-- lushness instead of grain, beats that thump rather than pulse, vocals high and clear in the mix. Still, something else entirely makes Grimes unique. There's an eerie, supernatural undercurrent to these songs, and the moody instrumental pieces that surround them.</p>
<p>Chris d'Eon's side of the split, which follows last year's LP <i>Palinopsia</i>, isn't without highlights. His best track is the wistful, R&amp;B-tinged ""Transparency"", a song about the uneventful sex lives of ghosts. Inspired by his longtime interest in Tibetan music, d'Eon figures himself in the Eastern symbol of the hungry ghost, a specter who's back from the beyond just to see his lover's face. Incidentally, not as great as it sounds: ""Do you want be human? Do you want to make love again? I guess that's just the price you're gonna have to pay for transparency."" Over the chorus' icy, arpeggiated synths, he comes to the logical conclusion: ""Doing this was a big mistake.""</p>
<p>In spite of d'Eon's weaker material (like the skittish and schmaltzy ""Thousand Mile Trench"") his tracks might have made a decent EP, but either way the two sides of <i>Darkbloom</i> don't work particularly well together. Following Grimes' tracks, which favor mood over story and transcend any particular emphasis on lyrics, d'Eon's half feels overly literal and tethered to the material world: His hungry ghost is left searching for a body to inhabit, while Grimes sounds altogether liberated from hers. Undoubtedly, Boucher hits the highest notes on <i>Darkbloom</i>, proving over the course of just five tracks that she's blossoming into a promising artist-- and one who's developing almost more quickly than we can keep track of. ""I've moved far beyond that,"" she's already remarked of this material in a <a href=""http://www.dummymag.com/features/2011/05/09/grimes-d-eon-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent interview</a> with <i>Dummy</i>. ""I'm working on a full-length, which I kind of feel is my first album."" And as the only complaint I've got with her side of <i>Darkbloom</i> is that it's too short, this is indeed cause for excitement.</p></div>"|15439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15439-darkbloom-ep/|7.2|Lindsay Zoladz

In ""We're Back!"", the opening track of their sophomore album, <i>Turtleneck &amp; Chain</i>, Lonely Island member Jorma Taccone points out how weird that was: ""Lonely Island! Grammy nominated!""-- this right after Andy Samberg raps about how his dick looks like ""the fat that you cut off a steak."" ""We're Back!"" is an absurd, overblown take on the intro to every self-aggrandizing blockbuster rap album ever, but <i>Turtleneck &amp; Chain</i> could well outsell plenty of the stuff it spoofs. Ridiculous as it may be, these guys are now something resembling pop stars. And no 2011 album has a list of guests as star-studded as this one: Justin Timberlake, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, Akon. They may be fake rappers, but real rappers don't have that kind of pull anymore.</p>
<p>And since they're pop stars now, the Lonely Island face a familiar problem on <i>Turtleneck &amp; Chain</i>: How do you follow up a big debut album without just repeating all the same tricks? These guys are, after all, ""Saturday Night Live"" employees, and repeating tricks is what ""Saturday Night Live"" does. <i>Turtleneck &amp; Chain</i> brings back a few characters from debut album <i>Incredibad</i>: Shy Ronnie, the ""Dick in the Box"" guys. And, for the most part, it recycles what made <i>Incredibad</i> work. The Lonely Island guys make jokes out of rap music but do it without mocking the genre, putting lifetimes of fandom in service of absurdist jokes that get progressively more absurd as the songs go on, bringing their superstar guests along for the ride. Michael Bolton, for instance, just <i>kills</i> his bit on ""Jack Sparrow"", wailing his absurdly catchy dorked-out movie-fan chorus and refusing to let the Lonely Island people stick with their boring club jam. Lesser comics would've just made fun of Michael Bolton's past; on this album, he actually gets something to <i>do</i>.</p>
<p>Of course, ""Jack Sparrow"" had a funny-as-hell video on ""Saturday Night Live"", and it doesn't play as well without its visuals. That's a problem here. Of the tracks that already appeared on ""SNL"", some of them work just fine on their own, like the infectiously joyous Akon collab ""I Just Had Sex"" or ""Threw It on the Ground"", a devastating but affectionate skewering of Dead Prez/Immortal Technique-style conspiracy-theory rap. Others, like ""Shy Ronnie 2: Ronnie &amp; Clyde"", are visual jokes that just don't make any sense without their videos, though it definitely helps that a DVD of those videos comes with the CD. The non-TV tracks generally don't hold up as well, but it's fun to match them up with their inspirations. ""Rocky"", for example, pushes the already-jokey premise of DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince's ""I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson"" to gory extremes, and ""Trouble on Dookie Island"" turns the breathless crime narrative of something like Ghostface Killah's ""Shakey Dog"" into a gross-out joke by having its desperate thug narrators shit themselves over and over and over.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>Turtleneck &amp; Chain</i>, the Lonely Island play around way more with dick and shit jokes than they did on their first album-- and for a group whose first massive success already had the word ""dick"" in its title, that's saying something. Some of it is absolutely terrible; the ""Falcor vs. Atreyu"" skit, in which <i>Neverending</i> <i>Story</i> characters fuck each other, is obnoxious enough to clear out a room at a Wolf Eyes show, and the intentionally annoying ""Japan"" hits its mark a little too well. For the most part, though, these are good songs with jokes in them, not jokes with songs attached.</p>
<p>An album full of fake rap, famous-people cameos, and scatological jokes shouldn't have any replay value whatsoever, but <i>Turtleneck &amp; Chain</i> holds up awfully well, partly because the music is almost always, at the very least, listenable, and partly because the jokes depend more on earwormy hooks and absurdities spinning out of control than on simple punchlines. The guest stars here all give some indication of why they're stars; Nicki Minaj's verse on ""The Creep"", for example, is just a great Nicki guest verse. (The Lonely Island guys themselves don't rap or sing anywhere near as well as their guests, but they're sketch comics and writers, not pop stars, so we can cut them some slack.) And even if these songs work best as ""SNL"" sketches, they should still work nicely on your next road trip.</p></div>"|15443.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15443-turtleneck-chain/|7.1|Tom Breihan

But then, their masterful 1993 sellout bid <i>Saturation</i> proved that their true talents were wasted on indie rock's ideals. As the opening act on both the era-defining <i>Vs.</i> and <i>Nevermind</i> tours, UO incongruously embraced the pursuit of fame and groupies. They rocked leisure suits, wore dinner-plate logo medallions, and crafted ostentatious Cheap Trick hooks. Much like the Hives or the Darkness a decade later, many wondered, ""Do they really mean it?"" but their stylized image was less cynical branding than a necessary multimedia confluence. Their music simply wouldn't have been convincing coming from guys in jeans and t-shirts. Unfortunately, the bummed burnout of the underrated 1995 album <i>Exit the Dragon</i> proved prophetic, and it was the last thing we'd hear from them until now. That was 16 years ago.</p>
<p>Unlike Windy City lightning rods Liz Phair and Billy Corgan, Urge can essentially show up in 2011 as if nothing happened in the interim, their legacy almost completely unaffected one way or the other. And <i>Rock &amp; Roll Submarine</i> finds them sounding like themselves, which is refreshing if only because no one else does. Nash Kato once sang, ""only booze improves with age,"" on all-time tearjerker ""View of the Rain"", but as vocalists, he and King Roeser come off the rack perfectly intact. And while the studio session lifers taking over the rhythm section surely lack the Q rating drummer Blackie Onassis brought to the table, in terms of sheer musicianship, he was replaceable.</p>
<p>In a surprising move for a band that always made space for in-jokes and grand self-mythology, <i>Rock &amp; Roll Submarine</i> makes no reference whatsoever to the hiatus or gives any indication that the decade and a half was spent fussing over the material or anticipating a kingmaking comeback. Though of a much higher fidelity than their T&amp;G releases, <i>Submarine</i> charges head-down with one-take immediacy, lean and strictly business. It's workmanlike and yet unlabored, with most tracks clocking under three and a half minutes and little thought given to overdubs, solos, or their often affecting acoustic side.</p>
<p>Still, <i>Submarine</i> is saddled with an uncharacteristic lack of flair both lyrically and musically. Strip away goofy set pieces like ""The Candidate"" and ""Erica Kane"" and the swaggering ""Sister Havana"", and Urge too convincingly dress down to blue-collar classic rockers-- strong character actors without much material to work with. It's hard not to wish that more was at stake. Even something as seemingly obvious as the barely metaphoric ""She's My Ride"" can't really commit itself to a properly horndog premise.</p>
<p>If it's any consolation, the songs are interchangeable and accomplished enough that long-time fans will be relieved that they didn't embarrass themselves. Newcomers, if any, will almost certainly wonder what the big deal was. Which is a shame. Last year's re-emergence of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, a band similarly derided as ironists during the 90s, felt like it could've set the table for Urge to prove that indie rock's attitudes toward showmanship have hardly changed in the past 20 years. <i>Rock &amp; Roll Submarine</i> is a reminder to thank Nash and King for the memories, but as an album, it seems unlikely to inspire new ones.</p></div>"|15440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15440-rock-roll-submarine/|5.8|Ian Cohen

Names include Damon and Naomi, Gary Olson of Ladybug Transistor, and Louis Philippe. There's isn't much in the way of clues as to why they wrote and recorded in secret, but this, their debut, sounds like an album that wasn't yet ready to be heard. It is beautifully crafted and rich in demure detail, but <i>Street of the Love of Days</i> is largely bereft of energy or direction.</p>
<p>It begins and ends very quietly. ""Foxes"" is a tip-toeing bookend whose arrangement includes harp, strings, and delicate melodic lead on Greek bouzouki. As she does in the bossa nova of ""Late Mornings"", Núñez-Fernández delivers her vocals here in Spanish whispers, all of which dovetail nicely with the gentle sonics at play. That sets the tone for the rest of the record. While her harmonies are top-notch at times (as they are in the appropriately autumnal lilt of a re-work of the Clientele's ""Harvest Time""), Núñez-Fernández's vocal performance rarely hold forth. Similarly, when performing his share of the vocal duties, MacLean rarely applies his voice in a way that elevates a song. Those compositions that clearly bear his influence sound similarly muted. ""Wild Winter Trees"" is a strummed watercolor that could have been (might be) a Clientele castaway, but its sub-two-minute length suggests sketch more than anything else.</p>
<p>As a whole, the lion's share of this record tends to feel the same way: a collection of 15 wide-ranging wallpaper sketches rolled out over 42 minutes. For fans of MacLean's work in the Clientele, this may prove to be a serious letdown. Both his voice and songwriting gifts make themselves heard in a standout like ""House of Flint"", but very little here proves to be as dynamic or memorable as the rest of his catalogue. That owes more to the issue that these songs seem far too unfocused to be amplified. In fact, Pipas is a band just as rooted in the 1960s as MacLean's main songwriting outfit. And together they make a great pair, the smooth textures of their voices a natural fit. But whether they're swaying through Brazilian music or trying British folk, what's most clear is that right now their music shoots to set a mood more than anything else.</p></div>"|15446.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15446-street-of-the-love-of-days/|5.7|David Bevan

With time, and a big general shift within indie rock, Blank Dogs actually turned out to be one of the first, and rather prescient, examples of the new lo-fi generation at work. Blank Dogs wasn't a cheap off-the-cuff take on the full-bodied (and pristinely recorded) dance-punk sound of the DFA. He was a purposefully stripped-down tribute to the first wave of bands that turned thrifty bedroom recording into a badge of honor. Heard in 2011, the grab bag of singles and random early tunes collated on <i>Collected By Itself</i> sounds less like the work of an indie outlier and more like the (retro-minded) Sound of Right Now.</p>
<p>True, <i>Collected By Itself</i> may not share many obvious sonic reference points with, say, Best Coast. But like the sun-and-fun wing of lo-fi, <i>Collected</i> defiantly foregrounds its fuzzed-out homemade qualities. It's just that everything sounds claustrophobic, rather than warm and inviting, with all the dynamic qualities of ""real"" rock squashed into a grimy mid-range blare. <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14933-land-and-fixed/"" target=""_blank"">As David Raposa pointed out in his review of Blank Dogs' last proper album</a>, 2010's <i>Land and Fixed</i>, this was very much intentional. Sniper chose to pay homage to a sound that reveled in murk and grime and gothic menace, and so why <i>wouldn't</i> his music sound like this? Though recent Blank Dogs records have grown brighter, their hooks more distinct, it's hard to imagine the songs on <i>Collected</i> being improved by cleaning them up for mass consumption. The chilly and muted vibe is a big part of the record's appeal, as it was for the records he draws from.</p>
<p>The muffled machine drums and fried-sounding synthesizers on <i>Collected By Itself</i> are often a dead-ringer for ""Nag Nag Nag""-era Cabaret Voltaire, and Sniper seems to have a similar conflicted relationship to pop as the early Cabs. These aren't dirges, and Sniper does have a weird knack for memorable choruses. But a tune like ""Waiting"", a ramshackle guitar stomper not a million miles from the current crop of San Francisco garage bands, is still a rarity. The bulk of <i>Collected</i> is propelled by Peter Hook bass lines throbbing weakly along and some squiggles of sour keyboard noise. Sniper's droning voice occasionally bears a resemblance to the late Jay Reatard in Anglophile mode, but usually stripped of any intensity, the choruses driven home by their nagging repetition rather than any sort of pop ecstasy.</p>
<p>In other words, as you might guess given the limited-edition nature of these songs on their original releases, it's not for everyone, especially in 27-song hour-plus bulk. If the gray and eerie world conjured by the grottier members of the original Rough Trade crew appeals, and you've never delved into Blank Dogs' ample discography before, then <i>Collected</i> might be for you. For everyone else, a little dose of this drizzly dourness will probably do you.</p></div>"|15422.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15422-collected-by-itself-2006-to-2009/|6.5|Jess Harvell

Pillowy guitars (courtesy of Danny Rowland), humble basslines (Ian Brewer), and airy vocals (Jen Weidl) all float calmly over uncomplicated drum machine beats. Light touches of fuzz and reverb give it an overcast feeling, making this summer record sound weirdly autumnal. <i>Go With Me</i> is filled with childlike melancholy and wonderment, like a lot of twee records. But ultimately, it leaves you to wonder what Seapony are actually contributing to the vast expanse of bands clutching Tiger Trap 45s and portable button makers.</p>
<p>The album starts on the right foot with ""Dreaming"", a jaunty, infectious tune with a spiky guitar line and a simple-yet-irresistible vocal melody from Weidl. ""Into the Sea""'s easygoing surf-rock is punctuated by handclaps and a nimble-fingered arpeggio. ""I Never Would"" goes a long way with its permeating sense of wistful nostalgia. If <i>Go With Me</i> were an EP with just those three songs, it would possess a great deal more replay value.</p>
<p><i>Go With Me</i> makes for wonderful background music, but paying closer attention reveals its inherent flaws. The sameness of the songs causes them to bleed into each other, never deviating from the same verse-chorus-verse template. This wouldn't particularly be a problem if the album weren't so safe, if its pleasant happiness or pleasant sadness were disrupted by a more excitable sense of emotion. Weidl delivers the lyrics with the same wispy soprano on every song.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that those words aren't very interesting. Injecting simplicity into pop songwriting isn't always a clichéd effort-- take Girls' ""Laura"", for instance-- but banalities like ""Blue Star""'s opening couplet, ""You sat by me/ You sat down by the sea,"" sully an otherwise decent song, and the chorus of ""So Low"" (""I miss you every day/ I wish you'd stay"") makes Rebecca Black look like Dan Bejar.</p>
<p>The best indie pop always finds a way to marry a sense of individuality to its jangle and bounce-- the violent noise underscoring Black Tambourine's output, or the literary flair and sometimes-subversive humor that marks Belle and Sebastian's. Think about the heart-wrenching, lacerating sadness of the Softies, or even the confrontational cuteness of Tullycraft. Unfortunately, the vanilla innocuousness of Seapony loses them in the shuffle. This is not to say they have delivered an utterly charmless album. If your anorak pockets are stuffed with indie pop show flyers, or you are a daily reader of <a href=""http://www.skatterbrain.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Skatterbrain</a>, <i>Go With Me</i> has a place in your record collection. But until they can really stand out from the crowd, Seapony just come across as garden-variety twee.</p></div>"|15412.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15412-go-with-me/|5.3|Martin Douglas

It's not hard to imagine what the American post-rap duo and the German electro-pop band saw in each other. Themselves created music of engrossing complexity, but had little aptitude for lucidity and directness. Meanwhile, the Notwist excelled at piercingly simple songs, but seemed to struggle with too many moving parts. Musically, all the two groups had in common were glitches, though Themselves' disturbances were strident while the Notwist's were silky and mild, and maybe that was the point. In combining their strengths, would they also compensate for each other's weaker areas?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">On 13 &amp; God's 2005 debut, the answer was yes and no. It included some <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoKEzYVhMRE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">terrific songs</a>, but most of them just sounded like the Notwist, or the Notwist with someone muttering to himself very rapidly in the background. The record didn't feel quite digested, and perhaps it just couldn't have-- the clean gauze of Markus Acher's voice and Adam ""Doseone"" Drucker's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2egGfd5j_k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Micro Machines Man</a> patter are virtually <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JoseySmith/List_of_fictional_products_from_The_Simpsons"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nuts and gum</a>. That's still the case on the long-awaited second album, <i>Own Your Ghost</i>, where we're zipped back and forth between their contrasting sounds so hectically that it causes musical jet lag. It's still a neat project with many moments of interest, but it's disappointing that the second album doesn't cohere overall any better than the first. More than anything, it makes you wish for a new Notwist album.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Because wow, there are some <i>good</i><i> </i>Notwist songs here. The album starts on a high note with ""Its Own Sun"", one of those instantly gettable acoustic numbers that Acher does so well, which floats along amid softly coursing glitches and coos. It crashes into the hyperactively skittering ""Death Major"", whose fast-rap magic tricks seem to have scurried in from an entirely different album. And then, suddenly, we're listening to another lovely Notwist song, ""Armored Scarves"", where Acher sinks one of his trademarked cryptic-but-loaded refrains into a flatteringly warm and purring environment-- at least until Dose's helium-voiced sing-song takes over in the second half, blasting drum fills in tow. The dividedness of the record is especially plain here. Acher generally gets calm and luscious music, and then all hell breaks loose whenever Dose shows up.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There isn't really much to say about the lyrics on this album-- for Acher, they're about bearing melody, and for Dose they're about dicing up space and time. Like the group's odd name, which apparently is a mysterious apostolic reference, the many words on this album feel like fervent (even messianic) messages being transmitted in a dense code that no one could hope to understand-- except for true detail-oriented obsessives, for whose diligent attentions Doseone's music is ideal. This microscopic way of listening is precisely the opposite of the dreamy semi-presence the Notwist inspire, and those two extremes clash here. At the musical level, the collaborative lines are much blurrier, and from the syrupy woodwinds and drippy ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDOC7JRDzYI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Whisper Song</a>"" bass of ""Janu Are"" to the warmly squealing naïve-pop of ""Oldage"", there are plenty of signs that these guys can make beautiful and coherent music together. If only they could find a way to make their two strong, sharply different vocalists sound as integrated and natural.</p></div>"|15433.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15433-own-your-ghost/|6.0|Brian Howe

Factory']|2011-05-17 00:00:00|2011|2016-06-11 17:29:01.130110|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".pyo4p4a51c.1.6:0.1.0.$15414/=1$15414.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>For any other artist, the idea of issuing four discs of moldy live recordings-- particularly for a performer who's been anthologized a couple of times already-- would reek of the worst kind of barrel-scraping, fan-fleecing cash grab. But to summarize a career as unlikely as Iggy Pop's, it makes perfect sense. Despite the enduring import of his first three albums with the Stooges and mid-70s collaborations with David Bowie-- the influence of which can still be heard today in everyone from Fucked Up to LCD Soundsystem-- those albums tell only part of the story.</p>
<p>The real reason why Iggy's been able to carve out a career for 40-plus years-- going from certain drug casualty to potential ""American Idol"" judge-- without the benefit of a platinum record is his magnetic charisma as a live performer. And long before YouTube allowed us to attend concerts vicariously, bootlegs played a crucial role in establishing that legend. Even without being able to see his wiry body slither across the stage, the seemingly bottomless supply of unauthorized Iggy concert recordings reified his incomparable talents for baiting a crowd, ad libbing, and rewriting ""Louie Louie"" with new lyrics more vulgar than <a href=""http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-fbi-laboratory-weighs-in-on-the-quotdirtyquot-lyrics-of-quotlouie-louiequot"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the FBI could've ever imagined</a>. At an Iggy show, what happens between the songs is just as entertaining and edifying as the songs themselves.</p>
<p>This quality was first widely brought to light with the most (in)famous of Iggy-related bootlegs, <i>Metallic K.O.</i>, a delirious document of the <i>Raw Power</i>-era Stooges' dying days (circa 1973-74) and Iggy at his self-destructive zenith, encouraging all manner of abuse (verbal or otherwise) from a bloodthirsty crowd. In contrast, <i>Roadkill Rising</i> is like the extended post-script to that moment, picking up the story in 1977, after Bowie had effectively brought Iggy back from the dead with the still-potent double-whammy of <i>The Idiot </i>and <i>Lust For Life</i>. The set devotes each of its four discs to performances from a specific decade, but even if you don't think Iggy has produced a front-to-back great album since 1979's <i>New Values</i>,<i> Roadkill Rising</i> is still worth your time.</p>
<p>No matter what era, each disc is padded with period performances of Stooges and Bowie-era material and amusing cover-song desecrations (ranging from ""Hang on Sloopy"" to the ""Batman"" theme), while 80s/90s selections like ""Blah Blah Blah"" and ""Home"" hit with greater force when stripped of their dated productions. But more significantly, <i>Roadkill Rising</i> functions less as a simple overview of Iggy's post-Stooges career than an elaborate portrait of the first punk who had to grow up in public, and the difficult transition from self-mutilating spectacle into respectable artist. Early on, at a Detroit show from 1977, we hear Iggy trying mischievously to muscle his way into the classic-rock canon with a cover of Them's ""Gloria"", wherein he uses the famous refrain to spell out his own name. But later, at a particularly unruly Detroit gig from 1980-- the excerpts of which alone are worth the compilation's price tag-- we hear him paying the price for his own petulance: It takes Iggy no less than three tries to get through a subdued, smoky cover of the Sinatra standard ""One For My Baby (And One More For the Road)"", as he's forced to talk down an increasingly impatient crowd who'd rather he do away with the showtunes shtick and get back to ""Cock in My Pocket"".</p>
<p>As <i>Roadkill Rising</i> traverses the 80s up through the 2000s, you can hear the audiences getting larger and more receptive to his whims, while Iggy becomes less concerned with antagonizing his audience than looking out for them; he cuts a 2003 performance of ""Dirt"" short to berate a bouncer for denying an over-eager fan's attempt to dance with him onstage. Inevitably, for a set that sprawls over four discs and 65 songs, <i>Roadkill Rising</i> is weighed down by blocks of inessential tracks from 1993's <i>American Caesar</i> and 2001's <i>Beat Em Up</i>, at the expense of including certified classics like ""I Got a Right"", ""Success"", ""I'm Bored"", and ""Fun House"" (the last of which is actually featured on the tracklist, but incorrectly so; it's really ""1970""). But even as it catalogs numerous changes in style, backing bands, and recording fidelity-- climaxing with selections from the Stooges' riotous 2007 reunion tour-- <i>Roadkill Rising</i> invariably succeeds in presenting an Iggy Pop gig as an exceedingly exciting place to be, where the line separating exhilaration and unrest is routinely blurred. And in the context of all that precedes it, the closing string of songs from Iggy's jazzy French-chanson experiment, <i>Préliminaires</i>-- complete with cordial, ""VH1 Storytellers""-style between-song banter-- feels less like the WTF left-turn it seemed upon release in 2009 and more like a well-deserved reprieve from spending the past four decades sating his audience's desire to see him open up and bleed.</p></div>"|15414.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15414-roadkill-rising-the-bootleg-collection-1977-2009/|7.2|Stuart Berman

They've been one of the world's great power pop bands that whole time-- hell, they've just been a great rock band-- and that's an oddly thankless achievement. They've never matched up with the flavor of the moment, or seemed to try to either, and it makes them easy to overlook, because people are always talking more loudly about something else.</p>
<p>But they've made a lot of music with staying power, records stuffed with great songs that sound good any time. Go back and listen to <i>Between the Bridges</i>, <i>Never Hear the End of It</i>, or <i>One Chord to Another</i>. They haven't aged a day. And here, 20 years in, they've made one of their best albums to mark the occasion. It comes three years after their last album, which matches the longest gap of their career, and even with all that time between to work on new material, it's still their shortest full-length, topping out under 35 minutes (longer with the iTunes bonus tracks). That brevity and focus turns out to be an asset, though-- there is no fat at all on the album, and every song is lasered into the shape that gives it the biggest impact. Four last less than two minutes and five seconds, and yet nothing feels slight or too short.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for that is that the album is expertly assembled to work as a seamless whole, much like <i>Between the Bridges </i>and <i>Never Hear the End of It</i> were. It's not a random collection of songs they happened to have around. ""Beverley Terrace"" reprises ""Shadow of Love"", and there are other call-backs on the album, not to mention the fact that songs are sequenced so that opening and closing tempos match up, and even the key changes sound good as one song turns into another. The band has also worked hard to broaden its sound. This is the lushest Sloan album, with several keyboard-driven tracks and a couple of heart-stopping ballads to give it a more varied landscape.</p>
<p>Though it's clearly structured to flow as an album and function as an absorbing start-to-finish listen, <i>The Double Cross</i> is still the kind of record that makes you want to talk about every song individually. Nearly any of them could work as a single. ""The Answer Was You"" is built around what sounds sort of like a Mellotron flute figure, with a hint of disco lurking in its rhythm guitar part. ""Laying So Low"" is the slow closer; it opens like an after-hours drag but quickly blossoms into something stirring. On ""Your Daddy Will Do"", Sloan, possibly by accident, manage to sort of diagnose the reason they're still making great rock records even though they've never been in fashion doing it: ""They kind of lost touch with what's in and who's who."" ""Unkind"" is the sort of stomping power pop tune that made them hitmakers on their Canadian home turf.</p>
<p>As great as all these songs are individually, they sound best together, and hearing them in relation to one another reveals things about them that are harder to catch when they're separated. That may seem paradoxical, but I don't think it is-- making this kind of record is a peculiar talent of this band. That they sound this creatively fresh this deep into their career is a real treat for people who've stuck with them through the years. If you've never given them a chance before, this is a great time to get to know them.</p></div>"|15407.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15407-the-double-cross/|8.1|Joe Tangari

Those fearful might look to self-proclaimed ""shitgazers"" Psychedelic Horseshit as the last line of defense. If even these snotty shamblers are willing to wipe their noses and tuck in their shirts, then maybe lo-fi is just this generation's musical training wheels.</p>
<p>Sure enough, if you drag your needle quickly across <i>Laced</i>, you'll probably think this Ohio band (now a duo) has cleaned up its act. There's less guitar muck, less maxed-out tape noise, and fewer moments of impenetrable chaos. But that doesn't mean the music is any clearer. These 11 songs are just as weird and demented as those that came before, maybe even more. The weirdness just comes from different sources now-- bouncy electronic beats, playfully psychotic synths, and Matt Horseshit's hypnotic voice, which has melted from brash and bratty down to stoned and endearingly subdued, even if it still sounds like it's pouring out of his nose.</p>
<p>All of which makes this edition of Psychedelic Horseshit more immediately enjoyable, whether or not you dug them before. To be fair, it's not a drastic turn-- 2009's <i>Shitgaze Anthems</i> was also pretty upbeat and relatively clean. But <i>Laced </i>takes those qualities to a new level, one filled with memorable melodies, bright atmospheres, and tons of sonic exploration. When things do get cacophonous, as in the overlapping drum stomps of the Black Dice-meets-Excepter ""I Hate the Beach"", it's more about epiphany than obscurity. That's also the case with Horseshit's vocals and lyrics which, as he rightly <a href=""http://www.sfbg.com/2011/05/03/some-shit-talking"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">noted</a>, ""are more dreamlike. There's not a lot of pointed 'fuck this' and 'fuck that.' I got sick of that stuff.""</p>
<p>Not too sick, though. The band's notorious <a href=""http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postrock/2009/03/sxsw_leftovers_talkin_expletiv.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wavves-bashing</a> still shows up on <i>Laced</i>, albeit more subtly. It's hard not to see the title ""I Hate the Beach"" as a veiled jab at both Nathan Williams and beach-obsessed chillwave. Same goes for the anti-summer lyrics of ""Tropical Vision"", which begins with the couplet, ""I don't need no waves/ Don't need no palm trees swaying."" But Psychedelic Horseshit aren't just tearing things down, they're building something unique out of the rubble. The best example is the title track, whose wavy synth glitter, computerized rattle, and Royal Trux-ish sing-speak form a bafflingly catchy hook, like a sculpture chiseled from scrap metal. It's a smart self-revision-- Horseshit and partner Ryan Jewell are hacking at themselves as much as their supposed rivals. As Horseshit <a href=""http://www1.sfbg.com/2011/05/03/some-shit-talking"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">put it</a>, ""Sometimes you gotta cut the tree down to make it bigger.""</p>
<p><i>Laced</i> is indeed bigger and bolder than previous albums, which is somewhat ironic since it has a more intimate, made-in-the-bedroom feel than the band's earlier basement forays. And its rangy invention points to a wider future for an act whose schtick could've gotten stuck in a static cul de sac. That's not because this album is cleaner or that lo-fi is larval skin to be shed. Psychedelic Horseshit might next get more lo-fi or more hi-fi, darker or poppier, better or worse. What I like most about <i>Laced</i> is it makes me excited to find out.</p></div>"|15425.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15425-laced/|7.3|Marc Masters

As Pitchfork's Joe Colly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12598-nodzzz/"" target=""_blank"">noted at the time</a>, there was a chance they'd ""face similar (and probably misguided) backlash-driven criticism"" that would eventually befall similar cool-cred-chasing bands. But Nodzzz, quite oppositely, couldn't have been any less cool-- childlike, clear-eyed, and at times off-puttingly cheery, their geeky earnestness set them apart, and no amount of tape crust could hide it.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, if you liked <i>Nodzzz</i>, there's no possible way you won't like <i>Innings</i>, a follow-up that often proves almost indistinguishable from its predecessor. Still adhering to the same I-don't-wanna-grow-up mentality and sprightly, brief songs, the band's motto remains the same, paraphrased pointedly on ""True to Life"": ""If you must make a picture, it should be true to life."" After all, the record is called<i> Innings </i>because co-songwriters Anthony Atlas and Sean Paul Presley spent their formative years playing baseball together. Opener ""Always Make Your Bed"" uses a simple chore to frame the idea of retreating home when the world beats you down. ""(Low) Energy"" seems to be about needing a cup of coffee. So yes, Nodzzz keep it simple and short (14 tracks at 23 minutes), and don't seem too interested in switching things up, which is fine: Their aloofness is a big part of the draw.</p>
<p>What has changed is the address, as Nodzzz are now a part of the Woodsist roster. After playing with Woods and Real Estate last year, the link-up seemed inevitable. Besides, if there's one band that Nodzzz share a true kinship with, it's Woods. The production has also been cleaned up a little, leaving room for some excellent little guitar tricks that feel properly spotlit, not showoff-y (dudes don't do ""showoff-y""). Nodzzz songs are categorically repetitive to the point of homogeneity, so these little moments-- the weird tunings on ""Time (What's It Going To Do?)"", the riffed-out ""Troubled Times""-- all display welcome finesse.</p>
<p>Which isn't to say their whole affable, Muppet-like bop can't get on your nerves. But for every silly dud (""Ye Olde Indian Towne""), there's something like ""Heyday Past Heyday Due"", a rare minor-key track about the realization that life's party might be winding down. <i>Innings</i> might not be your cup of tea, but there's little denying its charm-- as Atlas and Presley suggest, ""If it don't got soul or spirit, no one will come near it."" Which is clearly not something they need to worry about.</p></div>"|15408.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15408-innings/|7.1|Zach Kelly

The concept was flogged so hard in the 1990s, usually by dance producers desperate to break out of the club scene, that it was almost left for dead. It didn't help that most of these records were limp pastiches of old-school Hollywood orchestration that paled next to 99% of either actual film scores or real-deal pop albums.</p>
<p>All that bad product doesn't make the movie-less soundtrack a bad <i>idea</i>, of course. It's just that few of these projects have had the talent pool, or the commitment, to pull off a <i>Rome</i>. You can hear composer Daniele Luppi's love and respect for the brooding romanticism, fragile delicacy, and almost psychedelic spaceiness of classic Italian soundtracks in just about every note. In his partner Danger Mouse, he's found not only a similarly smitten collaborator, but a producer who's made a career out of accurately capturing the atmosphere of old records without (usually) coming off sterile. And they've got the moody vibe of those 60s soundtracks down on <i>Rome</i>, as much due to the vintage recording touches as to the Italian movie industry O.G.'s the duo drafted in to lend their hard-earned feel for this music.</p>
<p>But <i>Rome</i> isn't just about faithfully recreating a much-loved period in film history. It'd be a much more boring, if beautifully produced, record if it were. In addition to his work as a composer for film, Luppi's lent his talents as arranger and player to various pop acts, and Danger Mouse has spent much of his career using his crate-digger's ear to craft retro-minded albums that still work for a modern rock audience. <i>Rome</i>'s real coup is that, despite its concept hook, you don't <i>have</i> to listen to it as if it were a potential film score. What the duo's made is a beguiling and true hybrid, halfway between pop album and soundtrack-minus-the-movie. If you've got no familiarity with the music <i>Rome</i> pays homage to, you can take comfort that much of it sounds, coincidentally, very similar to the gentle-but-dark 60s psych-pop Danger Mouse makes with Broken Bells, sans a singer. And while it's true that the bulk of the album is instrumental, more concerned with mood than hooks, it's sequenced masterfully, including a handful of well-placed (if purposefully subdued) songs.</p>
<p>Luppi and Danger Mouse cannily snagged two talented but obviously very different voices in Jack White and Norah Jones. White's natural eeriness and Jones' diffident eroticism certainly fit a sound built around mystical melodrama and chilly Euro heartbreak, but their voices are such complimentary opposites that they turn out to be what gives <i>Rome</i> much of its distinctness, keep it from being just another record collector (or film collector) exercise in getting everything period-perfect. And true to the album's slippery not-quite-an-album/not-quite-a-score form, their contributions can either work as the big showcase moments for pop fans, or just as part of the soundtrack-like flow. And whether or not the album succeeds for you as a score to your own invisible flick, inducing images of fog-swept villas and sigaretta-chomping villains in fedoras as the organs swell and the guitars pluck mournfully away, it's purely gorgeous.</p></div>"|15435.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15435-rome/|7.0|Jess Harvell

There's a danger when taking on a wealth of different, very clearly defined sounds that the result could sound like casual genre-hopping, or a lack of focus, but instead is extremely well paced and well crafted.</p>
<p>It's no wonder: Africa Hitech are longtime electronic fixtures Mark Pritchard (<a href=""http://youtu.be/KBMaBYE-Awo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Global Communications</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzmawqmPX-E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Harmonic 313</a>) and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deuqlcfEW6Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steve Spacek</a>, two guys with the experience between them to make these sound clashes seem more fresh and edgy than merely reverent and knowing. That could come across as academic or chin-scratching, but thankfully above all there's an energy and vibrancy at the heart of <i>93 Million Miles</i> that evokes the feeling of two guys having a lot of fun exchanging ideas in the studio.</p>
<p>Some of the most viscerally enjoyable moments come when the duo uses Chicago juke music as its platform. ""Out in the Streets"" uses a well-worn sample from Ini Kamoze's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpivgO3QFbo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""World-A-Music""</a>, and bends it in and out of shape, chopping up the vocal and matching it to propulsive beats and pitched bass. Both the repetitive treatment of the hypnotic vocal and the 160 BPM beats are right in step with juke, but the sample choice and use of fifths lend it a dancehall feel.</p>
<p>If the album title <i>93 Million Miles</i> were to be taken as a sort of conceptual journey toward the sun, then ""Spirit"" ushers in its final descent. The track is bathed in warmth, as gentle vocals and harmonies guide the song above the subtle ebb and flow of the rhythm-- a staple of UK funky music. It's one of the clearest indications of how the duo's technical expertise ensured that its conceptual approach turned out to be a conversation between styles rather than something more ungainly and forced.</p>
<p>The final stretch of the album is also its strongest, taking in late-album highlights ""Light the Way"" and ""Cyclic Sun""-- a pair of spectral tracks indebted to exploratory jazz; each also projects the same inviting warmth felt on ""Spirit"". ""Light the Way"" uses forceful, live-sounding drums and pitched bass to wrap around a Sun Ra sample while ""Cyclic Sun"" jumps off from its title with revolving samples that weave around each other similarly to the way they tended to on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ViItcZyYBw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">early Four Tet</a> productions.</p>
<p>Perhaps most impressive, considering the ground Africa Hitech cover on <i>93 Million Miles</i>, is how together the record sounds. An album taking in so many far-flung sounds could be forgiven for sounding disjointed-- and although the leaps are sometimes wild, it hangs together beautifully, sounding like a fully realized work with tracks that build on one another rather than rub against each other. It's no small feat to craft something this adventurous and eclectic and still have it turn out to share the cohesion of a DJ mix, but Africa Hitech manage just that-- and despite all the left turns, you want to stick by their side every step of the way.</p></div>"|15399.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15399-93-million-miles/|8.2|Hari Ashurst

It's a question worth asking not just because of the lukewarm reputation he carries among many music fans but because Moby himself has spent so much time trying to answer it. The answer appears to be, resoundingly, ""not what you've been giving us,"" and I'll wager that it's not the ""<a href=""http://destroyed.moby.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">innovative microsite</a>"" or photo book that arrive concurrent to his latest album, <i>Destroyed</i>. Recorded as he toured, late at night and lonely, the record finds Moby sober and living in Los Angeles (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/garden/28moby.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nice digs</a>). He still possesses that particularly 1990s strain of self-loathing that doubles as egoism (he's <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/thelittleidiot"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@thelittleidiot</a> on Twitter), and he's probably two facial tics away from being a living, breathing David Lynch character.</p>
<p>One of the disappointing things about Moby is that his records and ideas are very simple even when he thinks they're very complex. Moby is 45, wealthy, and has deep thoughts about religion and food and friendship, but his umpteenth album is ""a soundtrack for empty cities at 2 a.m."" (his words). Do you find dark urban environments stark and eerie? Does air travel make you lonely? Have you ever felt isolated even when you are physically surrounded by buildings and people? You're either dealing with these questions privately or you're Thom Yorke. This is fertile territory, though: Artists have been mining flickering desolation for decades. Moby's key error is that while he was inspired by these scenes, <i>Destroyed</i> is the type of low-stakes atmospheric mush that lounges and airports and bars play to make you forget where you are (on ""The Low Hum"" a female voice intones, ""Like a tourist in some strange hotel,"" moving on before she can get to ""...listening to Moby""). It plays like a facile representation of these beautiful/melancholy environs instead of an exploration of them.</p>
<p>Moby still has only a few building blocks: sawing strings, hissy breakbeats, cantering pianos, dusty samples. He sings too, but thankfully not often. It's a good mix, actually, featuring shades of Derrick May's symphonic fantasies, the Orb's beatific ambience, and Air's relaxed dens. It's not exactly a fashionable style these days, and with a small amount of hustle it could become interesting again. Moby's more focused on <i>Destroyed</i> than on recent efforts <i>Last Night</i> or <i>Wait for Me</i>, which is just to say he's less likely to play punk or indie rock dress-up. But this is a dry and flat recording, which is inexcusable given both Moby's resources and how much even a <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14359-further/"" target=""_blank"">Further</a></i>-level return to form would benefit everyone involved. The strings flatten into the drums like hair kept too long under a hat. Those samples-- their sentiments unchanged since the late 1990s-- dully brush against the percussion. It's hard to believe that the feeble clacking that underlines ""Rockets"" took more than 10 minutes to program. There is no scrape, no tension, no noisy bullshit, and <i>Destroyed</i> is eminently un-replayable as a result.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/06224-moby-interview-destroyed"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Quietus</a>, Moby speaks to ""The humility that comes from being hated."" Moby's had his punk-ass moments, but at this point he isn't detestable; he's ignorable. It's a trade-off that would break any true rock'n'roll heart. Moby's made it clear he doesn't have that inside him: Fine, but we're still waiting for the moment when the wisdom, experience, and comfort he has earned manifest itself on record. We have lots of great music about the big, lonely, urban world-- some of it's by Moby. What we don't have is lots of music about the perils and contradictions of being a conscientious, horny, middle-aged millionaire. And if Moby's still wondering what people want from him, he's encouraged to start there.</p></div>"|15437.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15437-destroyed/|3.8|Andrew Gaerig

This was tense and jarring music, music that jumped around and demanded attention. Austra, Stelmanis' new band, makes just as much use of her stretched-out yip and her theatrical instincts, but the music is a lot warmer and more comfortable. Austra play a warm, hazy sort of electro-goth. It's synthetic and repetitive, and there's plenty of Giorgio Moroder in its DNA, but it's not dance music. Instead, it's music for a planetarium, or maybe for a mid-1980s PBS science documentary. Austra's synth riffs don't pound or undulate; they flutter and envelop. And Stelmanis doesn't sing over the top of their tracks; she emits sound from somewhere in the thick of it.</p>
<p><i>Feel It Break</i>, Austra's debut album, is essentially made up of 11 minor variations on a single sound-- no complaint, since they're good at that one sound. It's tough to talk about Stelmanis' icy, high-pitched deadpan delivery without mentioning Kate Bush. By that same token, it's tough to talk about the band's music without mentioning <i>Witching Hour</i>-era Ladytron, or maybe Bat for Lashes. This is pretty and heady music, music that can subtly change the air in the room where it's playing. Drums lightly percolate rather than thud, and synth riffs hide inside each other like Russian nesting dolls, gradually revealing themselves over the course of entire songs. And the group builds these things patiently. Often, it holds back on introducing vocals or drums for more than a full minute, letting the songs' feel develop before making any radical changes.</p>
<p>These songs aren't entirely alike. First single ""Beat and the Pulse"" has a telescoping sort of push-pull to it; it's the closest the band ever comes to genuine dance music, and even it doesn't come that close. On ""Lose It"", Stelmanis gets a chance to stretch her huge, tremulous voice over some minimally invasive synth backing, and she sounds titanic: ""Don't wanna <i>loooooose</i> ya."" The bouncy art-pop piano on ""Shoot the Water"" has a certain twitchiness, bringing Stelmanis partway back to her solo days. And closing tracks ""The Noise"" and ""The Beast"" do away with percussion entirely, letting Stelmanis sing over miasmic synth fog on the former and floridly ghostly piano on the latter.</p>
<p>Even with those variations, though, <i>Feel It Break</i> still works as a monochromatic album, one content to stick with the same shade of glimmering darkness. Onstage at SXSW a couple of months ago, Austra cut a stark figure-- Stelmanis backed by two stunning, harmonizing twins, the rest of the band half-hidden at the back of the stage. Even playing in the middle of an absurdly sunny day, the band seemed to exist in some vague state of perpetual glamorous nighttime; that could've been them, not Bauhaus, serenading David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve during the great opening scene of Tony Scott's otherwise bullshit vampire movie, <i>The Hunger</i>. On <i>Feel It Break</i>, they've got that creeping cinematic synth-psych style down cold. Moving forward, I'm curious to hear what else they can do.</p></div>"|15434.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15434-feel-it-break/|7.3|Tom Breihan

The two albums he made with that band in his basement were distinctly homespun and lo-fi sounding, but packed with some of his characteristic idiosyncrasies-- from recording on boomboxes to unexpected appearances of synth to flourishes of odd percussion. There was a sense that Women were being let into <a href=""http://www.vbs.tv/en-gb/watch/practice-space-season-2/practice-space-chad-vangaalen"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">VanGaalen's world</a> rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>So it makes sense that he returns to the sound of the two Women albums on his fourth LP, <i>Diaper Island</i>. VanGaalen's previous records are characterized by their eclecticism, veering from acoustic folk songs to electronic synth workouts, and they often sound like grab-bags drawn from his apparently prolific recording habits (he recently <a href=""http://www.toromagazine.com/music/interviews/a502bc9f-9d71-bf94-1dba-84611fd7aa4f/Chad-VanGaalen/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told an interviewer</a> he had recorded 80 songs leading up to this record). Part of what makes <i>Diaper Island</i> a success is its cohesive sound and restraint. There's an economy in his instrumentation and recording that allows a set of well-written songs to take center stage.</p>
<p>On <i>Diaper Island</i> VanGaalen internalizes feelings of restlessness into the fabric of his songs, giving them more depth than before. The de-tuned guitars of ""Peace on the Rise"" hew close to the sound of 1990s indie-- bands like Sonic Youth and Pavement loom large here-- spinning a downtrodden riff that's also quite an earworm. But the song's melancholy tinge takes an unexpected nosedive halfway through the song in a beautiful, droning mid-section that opens out with horns and rough textures. It's a characteristic left-turn, the kind of unexpected shift that VanGaalen used to perform with production switches on previous records.</p>
<p>But there's a lot of surface-level enjoyment too, as VanGaalen's excellent riffs compete for the spotlight. The best of these comes on ""Burning Photographs"", as glassy guitar propels zig-zagging verses in front of a loose, ticking drum beat. There's a satisfying energy at the heart of many of these songs, and VanGaalen allows them to sound slack and jammy as he launches into taut solos on ""Replace Me"" and ""Blonde Hash"".</p>
<p>The record manages to be compelling even during some of its weaker moments, such as spiky second-half cuts ""Freedom For a Policeman"" and ""Can You Believe It!?"". Both have an almost mean edge to them. VanGaalen sounds prickly on the latter song as he sings, ""That fucking mind scanner/ That made me piss myself/ Now that I'm calming down/ I'm really thankful they erased it."" It's not the most instantly enjoyable track on the record, but it shows a different side of VanGaalen's character and makes his songwriting feel more engaging on the whole.</p>
<p>VanGaalen closes the record with the line, ""Baby, will you love me/ I'm really feeling ugly,"" on a song called ""Shave My Pussy"", and <i>Diaper Island</i>-- as hinted at with that title-- isn't the prettiest record he's ever made. Instead, it's gritty and honest. Beneath the surface-layer thrill of some of these songs are subtle character shifts and brave one-liners, all of which confirm VanGaalen's status as gripping songwriter as well as a producer.</p></div>"|15428.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15428-diaper-island/|7.5|Hari Ashurst

Because if you're not, we're not going to accommodate you, to let you be part of and involved in this intimacy."" That's Wild Beasts' Hayden Thorpe speaking to <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/06240-wild-beasts-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Quietus</a> this week on both <i>Smother</i>, his band's latest, as well as the unmanageable position in which they've found themselves at home in England over the years. When the relatively isolated Kendal four-piece first arrived on the scene in 2007, their brand of flamboyant, almost vaudevillian indie rock was peerless in a landscape dominated by Arctic Monkeys and post-Libertines lad rockers. Thorpe's voice in particular-- a song-carrying instrument that moves between frilly falsetto and bulldog growl-- divided at most turns. You were either compelled to hang on every jagged syllable or run the other way.</p>
<p>And then they decided to streamline some: For the curvy art-funk of 2009's <i>Two Dancers</i>, they reigned in their more baroque tendencies. Thorpe brushed his voice soft, the lower register croon of bassist Tom Fleming was worked in further to act as anchor, and a band that seemed too difficult and bizarre to shoehorn into the pop conversation was sorta kinda flirting with exactly that. Well, that's how it looked from the outside.</p>
<p>Despite the many critical successes of that album, Wild Beasts have remained an act with no intention of blending in. <i>Smother</i>, their third full-length, is just as the above quote promises: completely uncompromising.   And that's why it succeeds. Thorpe and Co. have continued down the path of <i>Two Dancers</i>, paring their sound down even further. What they're left with is naked in arrangement, nocturnal in tone, and deeply, deeply sensual. And that, actually, seems to be the ""intimacy"" to which Thorpe intimated in conversation with <i>The Quietus</i>. From the first moments of ""Lion's Share"", an opening, piano-led crescendo: ""I wait until you're woozy, I wait until you're lame/ I take you in my mouth like the lion takes its game.""  It's a line he delivers in a very controlled, sympathetic manner, one that would have stumbled out of his mouth four years ago.</p>
<p>And while the dimpled electronic grooves of <i>Smother</i> do make for close listening, Thorpe's overtly sexual couplets provide a slinky analog to the sonics at play. In ""Bed of Nails"", a melodic marvel in its own right, he uses a skittering bridge to proffer a few grunts, howls, and moans. But again, what makes this all work so well is the remarkable amount of restraint and rhythmic know-how these four employ. This band has come long way in that regard-- it's not easy to integrate the sounds of sex into song without coming off like the kind of guy with a favorite tree from which to creep.</p>
<p>Additionally, all of these songs undress very beautifully on their own terms as well. The ribbons of guitar that bind ""Loop the Loop"" together at its halfway point are stunning, praises that can also be sung for the acupunctural textures of closing beauty ""End Come to Soon"". Wild Beasts have never been an especially easy outfit to connect to either forebears or contemporaries, but here they've found certain amount of kinship in the dusky, liberated grooves of Talk Talk's Mark Hollis. You can hear it in the somber tick-tocking of ""Invisible"", just as much as the orbit of single ""Albatross"". But that's about as strong a link as you're likely to find, a feat in its own right. This is gloriously layered music that opts to celebrate its quirks and cowlicks rather than suppress them. Organically. There's a great amount of comfort that comes in hearing something like that. Thorpe delivers a unforgettable line in the circular prowl of ""Plaything"", a new age sex jam if there ever was one. ""New squeeze, take off your chemise, and I'll do as I please,"" he quivers. ""I'm not any kind of heartthrob, but at the same time I'm not any kind of slob.""  He makes a good point.</p></div>"|15436.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15436-smother/|8.2|David Bevan

The band performs black-metal festivals in jeans and street clothes, instead of the normal corpse paint, to heckling and jeers. In interviews, he talks about metal's ability to induce ""disorientation from ordinary, end-directed existence"" like some black-metal David Foster Wallace. He uses the music, which has virulent opposition to Christianity encoded in its DNA, as a vehicle to explore Big Ideas about, among other things, Christian redemption. <i>Aesthethica</i>, their second album, comes out on Thrill Jockey, home to the Sea and Cake, High Places, Fiery Furnaces, and absolutely zero other metal bands. Oh, and if you ask, he's also happy to share stories about hanging out with Ezra Koenig when they both went to Columbia University.</p>
<p>He and Koenig would probably still get along-- they both seem to take a perverse joy insouciantly baiting the easily riled. The hatred Liturgy have incurred is white-hot and laser-focused, as the Google search for ""<a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=Liturgy+black+metal+hipster+assholes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Liturgy black metal hipster assholes</a>"" eloquently attests. As it is with any genre, black metal ""authenticity"" is basically a smell test: It's black metal if it <i>feels</i> like black metal. It's an unassailable, indefinable, and profoundly inarguable criterion, but there it is. And it must be said that, in the end, Liturgy just don't <i>feel</i> like black metal. Somehow, you can hear the jeans.</p>
<p>Luckily, this doesn't matter in the slightest. In fact, it's <i>Aesthethica</i>'s primary sense of strength. Without ""reinventing"" black metal, Liturgy have successfully refashioned its basic components-- the thundering, all-sixteenths assault of blast beats, shredding tremolo guitars, and boiled-pitch vocals-- in their own willful image and directed its energy toward the
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
ir own idiosyncratic ends. Hunt-Hendrix might be the kind of guy who says things like, ""The meaning of black metal has something to do with a longing for ecstatic annihilation, a perfect void,"" in interviews, but he's also the kind of musician who pursues these thoughts just as enthusiastically in his music. <i>Aesthethica</i> is inventive, alive, and shrieking with more ideas than many bands explore over an entire career.</p>
<p>The idea of ""a perfect void"" can be heard in Liturgy's complicated relationship with momentum. Many songs here settle into a mesmerizing stasis as often as they barrel forward. Songs that seem to be gearing up for a stratospheric takeoff instead harden into a rhythmic lockstep. ""Generation"", for instance, grinds out a series of syncopations on a single thudding power chord for a mind-obliterating seven minutes. It resembles Steve Reich's <i>2 x 5</i>, in which two rock ensembles face off onstage and play highly mannered figures at each other, more than the work of any metal band.</p>
<p>The echo of Reich isn't incidental; even more than their debut <i>Renihilation</i>, <i>Aesthethica</i> feels like black metal by way of the conservatory. Hunt-Hendrix, it turns out, studied composition at Columbia with spectralist composer Tristan Murail, and guitarist Bernard Gann is the son of the post-minimalist composer and former <i>Village Voice</i> critic Kyle Gann. You can hear the sound of A-students getting loose in some of <i>Aesthethica</i>'s wilder moments: the glimmering fugue of guitars buzzing like mechanized locusts on ""Sun of Light"", for example, or the perpetual-motion keyboard canon that opens ""Helix Skull"". Hunt-Hendrix's words, which are utterly indistinguishable sans lyrics sheet, point determinedly toward the same transcendence the music seems to be aiming for: ""Floating upwards/ Lungs filling up with air/ As God inhales me/ Into the impossible,"" Hunt-Hendrix screams on ""True Will"".</p>
<p>None of this will endear Liturgy to black-metal fanatics, of course. But every insular scene needs its carpetbaggers and interlopers, and Liturgy can hardly be accused of disrespect; you just don't make something this joyful out of music you hate. Without interested outsiders peeking their nosy way in, we would have never seen David Bowie, or Elvis Costello, or the Beastie Boys, or Bad Brains. Liturgy, for their part, seem more than willing to take their lumps for what they believe in. As Hunt-Hendrix recently told <i>Time Out New York</i>, ""We are really willing to suffer being hated for doing what feels right aesthetically."" If that isn't fucking <i>kvlt</i>, nothing is.</p></div>"|15427.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15427-aesthethica/|8.3|Jayson Greene

Since its inception, the band has remained in a state of flux, with members coming and going almost on a show-by-show basis. The mainstay has been Aimée Collet Argote, a guitar player and songwriter currently based in Philadelphia. She spent nearly four years recording her second full-length, and one would imagine that would give her plenty of time to think up a better album title than <i>Don't Rock the Boat, Sink the Fucker.</i></p>
<p>There is a curious incongruity between the presentation of the music and the music itself on <i>Fucker</i>. Scribbled across a radiant photo of Argote, that title suggests a bumper sticker more than an album, and ""My Saddle Is Waiting (C'Mon Jump on It)"" and ""Bonne Chance, Asshole"" don't sound like songs called ""My Saddle Is Waiting (C'Mon Jump on It)"" and ""Bonne Chance, Asshole"". Anyone expecting agitprop mallpunk or ironic cowpunk covers may be surprised by the shimmery pop sound of <i>Fucker</i>, which creates a dynamic, often dense sound out of a minimum of instruments.</p>
<p>This is an album of compelling contradictions and frictions. Argote is an especially forthcoming songwriter, penning incisive and cutting lyrics about female relationships that range from self-destructive (""I was fucking every girl who looked my way"") to accusatory (""when you find a lover that you want to keep, I think you'll talk to her first, before you tell her you don't love her""). She bares her soul on the lyrics sheet, yet sings and mixes her vocals as if to obscure her words, often bending her syllables or burying them in the mix. Rather than alienating, however, the tactic proves engaging, as she makes the listener lean into the music and work to decipher it.</p>
<p>Most of the time it's well worth the effort, as Argote and her collaborators-- including guitar player Noah Howard and drummer Ashley Arnwine-- capture a loud sort of quiet, emphasizing the softer passages to give the abrasive moments more weight. It's most effective on ""My Saddle Is Waiting (C'Mon Jump on It)"", which begins with a gentle acoustic theme that repeats throughout the song. By the end, it has changed completely simply by juxtaposition to other melodies and motifs, and all the elements come together for an unexpectedly poignant finale. ""Howard's Hour of Shower"" is so spare that you can hear the speaker buzz behind her chiming guitars and vocals. On the other hand, ""It's Only a Bargain If You Want It"" churns stridently as the instruments grind against each other and Argote sings, ""You will always be my girl."" It's both reassuring and menacing-- a promise and a threat.</p>
<p>Listening to <i>Fucker</i>, it's difficult to discern Argote's intentions regarding that disconnect between the packaging and the music-- or if she even intended such a disconnect. The effect, however, is often intriguing, suggesting a sleight of hand that slyly upends listener expectations about the sound and politics of gender, sexuality, lust, love, and indie rock. To her credit, she never comes across as strictly political or academic, although surely she doesn't really buy into that title. Sinking the fucker is much too blunt; Des Ark rock with more nuance than that.</p></div>"|15418.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15418-dont-rock-the-boat-sink-the-fucker/|7.4|Stephen M. Deusner

In addition to five albums with the Mars Volta, each a hyper-detailed slab of acid rock in their own right, the guy's released more than <i>20</i> solo albums and collaborations over the past seven years, ranging from meandering journeys through electronic ambience to noodling saxophone-driven fusion jams to frantic riff-heavy hard rock. On <i>Telesterion</i> you get a very large dose of all three modes. And yet, even as wide-ranging summary of Rodriguez-Lopez's last decade of activity, this compilation only offers a hint of the scope of his project.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily a bad thing. Rodriguez-Lopez's creative outpouring has often felt from the outside like productivity-for-its-own sake rather than someone building a well-curated body of work. Like the Mars Volta's endless-seeming multi-part epics, going overboard is sort of the whole point with Rodriguez-Lopez's solo career, both in terms of the sheer number of records and their musical indulgences. This is grand and outlandish and virtuosic stuff, less about writing songs than locking into crazed and complicated grooves while everyone else (including the singer) wails overtop. The best of these records are still aimed squarely at the cult already wanting to hear Rodriguez-Lopez and his admittedly talented band of collaborators show off their chops, get deep in the pocket. Some of these records have even alienated fans, though, especially the ones that fully abandon the fractured funk of heavy 1970s jazz-rock (at which Rodriguez excels, even if it's a very minority interest among modern rock fans) for experimental sound-manipulation (which sometimes feel more like private sketches than anything the public might actually be interested in). So a compilation like <i>Telesterion</i> should be a much-needed chance to both edit out weaker stuff and allow curious Volta fans an easier in. Right?</p>
<p>Well, yes and no. If it's easier to get to grips with than listening to a few dozen individual albums, <i>Telesterion</i> is still in keeping with dude's general mission in life. A vast and unwieldy thing, offering two and a half hours of sound to digest, it's in no way a user-friendly greatest hits. There are songs, even hooks, in this mass
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
, but they're clearly not the main draw for artist or fans. Some tracks, like ""Sex, Consolation for Misery"", are little more than extended guitar solos, though if you've got a low tolerance for shameless displays of instrumental virtuosity then you're probably not the intended audience. The experiments, like ""Deus Ex Machina"", which sounds like recordings swiped from Latin American radio and subjected to all sorts of studio trickery, still make up a good percentage of <i>Telesterion</i>'s running time.</p>
<p>But bracketed by the claustrophobic (if sometimes very thrilling) guitar freak-outs and Mahavishnu slow-jams, these interludes suddenly feel more like necessary breathers. And <i>Telesterion</i> is indeed very well-sequenced for what it is. The opening three-song runs offers some of the most direct (read: rocking) music of Rodriguez-Lopez's solo career, easing you into the extremely loose stuff to come, and even late into the second disc, he'll throw in a wailing hard rocker like ""The Power of Myth"" to bring things back to Earth. For most people reading this, at a time when few of us still park ourselves in front of our stereos for a few hours to soak in music without distraction, it all probably still sounds like just too much to process. But while in no way aimed at pop fans, it's more repeat-listenable than anyone except the biggest Rodriguez-Lopez die-hard would have expected.</p></div>"|15424.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15424-telesterion/|6.0|Jess Harvell

His rich croon carries a bit of Elvis Presley's curled-lip sneer and touches of Nick Cave's matter-of-fact rumble, and his dark-hewed retro-rock tunes are spare and slinky; should David Lynch ever helm a ""Mad Men"", Kirk and company could easily provide the score. Timber Timbre's latest, <i>Creep On Creepin' On</i>, is <span>a dapper set of darkly atmospheric doo-wop and blues </span>but possessed with a style all its own.</p>
<p><i>Creep On</i>'s stark, shadowy swing is nearly as distinctive as Kirk's voice. <span>With its emphasis on empty space and a fondness for acoustic instruments, there's a twisted proto-rock'n'roll feel to it, like the Everly Brothers if Susie'd never woken up. </span>There's also a Grizzly Bear-like balance of spaciousness and swiveling parts, although <i>Creep On</i>'s tone is far bleaker than that of <i>Veckatimest</i>. These songs shuffle and sway before strings and saxophones (the latter from sideman-of-the-moment Colin Stetson) inevitably start to swarm, sending bold streaks of color through the black-and-white filter of Kirk's midnight creep.</p>
<p>Strange and startling, these bursts of cacophony provide an unlikely counterpoint to Timber Timbre's stripped-back tunes. Though they're meant to heighten the desperation at the heart of these songs, the two sides clash about as often as they complement each other, the towering, clamorous arrangements occasionally overpowering Kirk's melodies. But when it all comes together, it's stunning; highpoint ""Woman"" starts out honking, downshifts into an insistent croon, and then ramps back up again to close, moving fluidly through its wildly disparate sounds. But a yearning ballad like ""Lonesome Hunter"" would've fared just fine without the 30 seconds of orchestral insanity that closes it out; same goes for the din that ends ""Do I Have Power"" or the out-from-nowhere instrumental midsection of opener ""Bad Ritual.""<br/><br/>At their loudest, these dissonant blasts all but crowd Kirk out of his own record; a shame, since his skewed takes on romantic obsession are a worthy focal point. Though Timber Timbre should be praised for attempting to bring these disparate sounds together, they'd fare better with fewer instrumental freakouts, clearing more room for Kirk's twisted tales of romance gone awry. Stylish as Kirk's songs can be, they aren't always well suited by <i>Creep On</i>'s contrasting patterns.</p></div>"|15431.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15431-creep-on-creepin-on/|6.7|Paul Thompson

In the dog days of 2009's deadbeat summer, the Antlers frontman emerged from his bedroom with his third LP, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13196-hospice/"" target=""_blank"">Hospice</a>.</i> On it, he unfashionably embraced hackles-raising choruses and concept-album ambition, and he pushed the button on emotional nuclear options: abortion, cancer, death, all that fun stuff. Now a trio, the Antlers have claimed the influence of ""electronic music"" for <i>Burst Apart, </i>a typical omen for a typically ""difficult follow-up album."" But while <i>Burst Apart </i>sheds the PR-bait bio and Arcade Fire aspirations that made its predecessor a word-of-mouth success, it's still tethered to a magnanimity and expressive clarity that makes it almost every bit as devastating.</p>
<p>Lead single ""Parentheses"" didn't do much to show their hand; it's pretty misleading out of context. Sounding like a higher-BPM <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbtZyuOMdHI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Climbing Up the Walls""</a>, the knockabout electronic percussion and tweaked piano ripples rightfully marked some connection to the post-<i>OK Computer, </i>pre-<i>Kid A </i>application of Mo' Wax and Warp textures to alt-rock song structures. But the aggression in Silberman's falsetto and the gnarly guitar distortion are revealed as total outliers, and <i>Burst Apart </i>can actually be seen as <i>Hospice </i>turned inside out: Where before, long swathes of calm white noise linked emotive outcries, <i>Burst Apart</i> moves patiently through luxurious downtempo tones belying some serious romantic disturbance.</p>
<p>Those well-versed in dream journal interpretation could gather that from the mere title of ""Every Night My Teeth Are Falling Out"" (a common symbolic manifestation of sexual frustration). After all, <i>Burst Apart </i>does open with ""I Don't Want Love"", a heartbreaking wallow in a numbing hangover from a singer who previously seemed doomed to feel too much. Its glistening melody at least helps it scan as pop, but ""Parentheses"" and ""Every Night"" feel cut from the same cloth as the Walkmen's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWR1h-5EzUo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Rat""</a>, holding onto sanity with white knuckles, sexual congress seen as mutually assured destruction.</p>
<p>Aside from those, <i>Burst Apart</i>'s atmosphere is nocturnal and desolate. Foreboding death-crawl ""No Widows"" fears for vehicular disaster; brief flickers of light are allowed full exposure on the gorgeous, incantatory centerpiece ""Rolled Together"", whose brushed drum work and silvery guitars could be heard as a studiously completed homework assignment on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7151-agaetis-byrjun/"" target=""_blank""><i>Agaetis Byrjun</i></a>. Meanwhile, the tender, nearly beatless balladry of ""Hounds"" and ""Corsicana"" are wholly the Antlers' own and painfully pretty to behold-- however depressive Silberman's lyrics, one can simply revel in the zero-gravity synth and vocal moans and feel some sort of uplift.</p>
<p>Shame that it makes <i>Burst Apart</i>'s missteps all too egregious. This isn't the sort of record that calls for a show-stopping power ballad, but we get one anyway with ""Putting the Dog to Sleep"", where needlessly histrionic vocals and an overwrought doo-wop progression come off more like last call karaoke than a fitting closer. If nothing else, ""Putting the Dog to Sleep"" helps point toward the Antlers successfully making <i>Burst Apart </i>more about their growth as a band than a gripping backstory-- for all of <i>Hospice</i>'s raw power, it didn't leave much to the imagination, and it either hit you right in the gut or not at all. The Antlers won't hold your hand through <i>Burst Apart</i>, which will inevitably make it more of a grower, but stick around-- it's all the more affecting for how it allows you to pick your own stumbling, lonely path.</p></div>"|15411.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15411-burst-apart/|8.2|Ian Cohen

Not that their early records were ragged things. Not at all. Released when the first generation of lo-fi acts still defined (more or less) the very sound of indie, 1994's self-titled debut and 1995's <i>Nassau</i> and <i>The Biz</i> were mostly gentle and very lush. The Sea and Cake made sweet and accessible music-- singer Sam Prekop's just-out-of-bed voice is one of the most immediately ingratiating in indie rock-- that was pristinely captured and expertly played.</p>
<p>These were also guitar records, though, and the hint of raw electric amplification that remained was a faint reminder that these guys had their roots not in jazz clubs or world music festivals but in the 80s post-punk underground. By 1997's <i>The Fawn</i>, any lingering fuzz and rock rambunctiousness had gone. Like the post-rock bands they always found themselves bracketed with, the Sea and Cake drew from a broad range of sources beyond trad guitar rock, but they also wrote hummable, heartsick songs rather than instrumental jams or sound-art collages. Yet as they adopted late post-rock's loungey smoothness and melodic/rhythmic repetition, their records threatened to become the same sort of avant-pop background music.</p>
<p>The Sea and Cake have never seen that trajectory as a problem, and indeed they've continued to release intermittently brilliant records in this vein. In <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12364-car-alarm/"" target=""_blank"">his review</a> of 2008's <i>Car Alarm</i>, Pitchfork's Mark Richardson rightly claimed this same-ness as one of the band's virtues; if they never wildly experiment they also never stray from their strengths long enough to potentially fall on their faces. When you buy a Sea and Cake record, you can be assured a certain amount of comforting familiarity (down much to Prekop's breathy delivery stamping every record with the band's trademark) and quality control (having a top-shelf producer for a drummer helps when making music where every element sounding crisp and placed just-right in the mix is key). But one of the nicest things about <i>The Moonlight Butterfly</i> is that it's the first record in a long time where the Sea and Cake seem to be stretching out and trying new things. They're also getting back to the warm sound of guys in a practice space rather than an antiseptic sound-lab.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, it's obviously a Sea and Cake album from the moment Prekop's just-louder-than-a-whisper voice comes on. They still make the kind of rare rock that's both inventive and so laid-back you feel like you should be supine while listening. Their music is most perfect first thing in the morning or late at night, when you're too sleepy for something louder, uglier, or more complexly obtrusive. Opener ""Covers"" might be the platonic Sea and Cake tune, split evenly between the lovely live-band jitters of their first three records and the slick programmed-sounding swoon of the stuff that came later. It's all there: Prekop's drowsy melodies delivered in that inimitable longing sigh, the precise and sparkling interplay between the jangling rhythm guitar and heart-tugging little bits of melodic filigree, and a lite motorik pulse that gives the whole song a frictionless, soaring quality. ""Up on the North Shore"" is a dead-ringer for something off one of those first three rock-centric albums, like the Feelies drained of all anxiety until just a joyful bounce remains, with breaks for the closest this band ever gets to guitar heroics. (Not very close, in case you were wondering.) ""Monday"" hearkens back to the jazz-pop and samba percussion that drove Prekop's classic 1999 solo debut, and breathes in a way that much of the band's layered and synth-heavy post-<i>Fawn</i> work doesn't.</p>
<p>But departures are more interesting and more striking than the chances for fans to reminisce about the old days. That doesn't always mean they're better, of course. It's curiously fun to hear the band take a left-turn into instrumental Moroder-esque electro-pop on the title track, but it's still feels like more of a one-off experiment than a new direction, or even of a piece with the rest of <i>Moonlight</i>'s more human touch. If they'd actually turned it into a song, or developed this sound across the whole album, it might be a different story. ""Inn Keeping"", the album's 10-minute centerpiece, is a much more assured swerve into new territory. It takes the Neu!-like rhythms all over different parts of <i>Butterfly</i> and stretches them into a true Neu! epic, complete with an uneasiness that's surprising for this most buoyant of bands but sacrifices none of the prettiness.</p>
<p>But at just six songs, even with one really long tune, there's a certain slightness to <i>Butterfly</i>. You may drift through recent Sea and Cake records more than you engage with them, but you still tend to want to drift for longer than a half-hour. Nevertheless it suggests the band is still master of the niche it's carved, and not out of new ideas just yet. Almost two decades into its career, those are nice surprises for those who've been following along the whole way.</p></div>"|15404.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15404-the-moonlight-butterfly/|7.0|Jess Harvell

Luke Temple's solo project has always split the difference frustratingly between the two. On his self-titled 2009 record, Temple seemed the epitome of the pop-song-loving basement tinkerer, recreating for his own private amusement various strains of psych-pop. It was, as a result, only fitfully involving. On last year's brighter, splashier follow-up, <i>Pigeons</i>, he recruited a whole band to flesh out his visions, but the project meandered through a maze of styles with the same seashell-collecting abstraction.</p>
<p>As a result, Here We Go Magic has been a hard project to commit to; for every moment of tingly brilliance-- say, the fluttering, slow-building epic ""Collector"", from <i>Pigeons</i>, or the mesmerizing tangle of loops and drone that was the self-titled's ""Only Pieces""-- there were an equal number of momentum-squashing detours and mediocre genre experiments. <i>The January EP</i>, by contrast, is Temple's most cohesive release under the Here We Go Magic name. He sticks with one iteration of his kaleidoscopic command of styles: the narcotized, childlike 60s folk-pop of Syd Barrett or the Move. Every song here has a surreal shimmer and sounds slightly warped at the edges. There are no towering achievements on the level of ""Collector"", but <i>The January EP</i> is Temple's most consistently immersive listen yet.</p>
<p>The first track, ""Tulip"", is a good example of Temple's effortless command of sense, style, and sound. He croons in a narcotic falsetto over a queasily shifting backdrop of guitar pop, one that evokes SoCal psychedelia at one moment and slinky, strutting Hall &amp; Oates funk at another. ""Hands in the Sky"" deploys gorgeously rippling waves of planetarium synths to flatten a puffing drum-machine and a burbling guitar, while Temple sings in a keening Pete Townshend imitation. ""Hollywood"" suspends acoustic finger-picking that falls like individual raindrops miles above an ominous bass groan and a dry snare shimmer. Every sound instantly arrests the ear, and Temple pins it back in place neatly once it's there with his indelible melodic sense. There are still a couple of puzzling decisions-- ""Backwards Time"" is such a pitch-perfect evocation of the Police that it's actually distracting-- but <i>The January EP</i> succeeds where the other Here We Go Magic releases have mostly failed; instead of handing you a couple of shiny baubles, it provides you with an inviting headspace to fall into.</p></div>"|15430.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15430-the-january-ep/|6.9|Jayson Greene

It may have been the first time most people had considered McGuire in a solo context, but he'd actually been equally busy in that realm as well, issuing tracks on an assortment of limited CD-Rs, cassettes, and compilations. <i>A Young Person's Guide</i> gathers highlights from these small-run releases, offering a nice overview of what McGuire's solo work is all about.</p>
<p>Tracks here generally fall into one of a few different types. There are the spacey meditations where single notes are plucked to create a hypnotic effect that nods to minimalism and <i>kosmische</i> explorations that bring to mind in particular the landmark <a href=""http://www.ashra.com/disco/1751in.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Inventions for Electric Guitar</i></a> by Ash Ra Tempel's Manuel Göttsching. On tracks like ""Radio Flyer"", ""Explosion Alarm"", and ""The Marfa Lights"", McGuire uses bits of delay and overlapping patterns of cleanly picked tones to create music that feels weightless and airy and meditative.</p>
<p>Other tracks use harder strumming and looping chords and veer closer to the world of rock proper, and here the focal point is exploring the possibilities of a single chord progression. ""Dream Team"" has a steady pulse, harmonized leads bathed in distortion, and distant vocals, and the way it builds and gradually shifts creates a mood of uplift and even triumph. ""The Path Lined With Colorful Stones"" takes an even simpler strummed pattern as its base, which allows McGuire to spin out tendrils of melody on top that feel loose and ragged but without clear direction but that nonetheless manage to resonate. Here, McGuire's music feels partway between the thick, mantra-like approach of <a href=""http://www.scaruffi.com/vol6/dissolve.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Roy Montgomery</a> and the fluid melodicism of the <a href=""http://www.thedurutticolumn.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Durutti Column</a>'s Vini Reilly. And then there are bright, pastoral instrumentals like ""Icy Windows"" and ""Time Is Flying"", which have a loose grounding in folk but take on a more mesmerizing quality through repetition.</p>
<p>Tracks vary in length from interludes that last barely over a minute to the 17-minute ""Dream Team"". Many of the pieces fall into spaces between these loose categories, but taken together, over the course of two packed CDs, they give a good idea of the range of McGuire's interests. It's not an especially <i>wide</i> range, but it is executed very well. He knows where he wants to go and what it takes to get there.</p>
<p>Is almost two and a half hours of guitar-based, mostly instrumental music overkill? It's really not. The way McGuire's music functions, I don't detect an upper limit for when it might grow tiresome. The longest tracks would also work fine even if they were longer; it's music that strives for endlessness in the best possible way. So this is the kind of record you can just put on at moderate volume when you are doing things and it fills a room nicely with warm, inviting sound. And then, when you're in the mood for more intense engagement, you can add another quarter-turn to the volume knob and take in the full force of McGuire's arrangements. The music shows remarkable flexibility.</p>
<p>Part of it is up to the fact that dynamic range is limited. There's little that is jarring or surprising. This is music that wants to wrap you in an affectionate embrace and serve as a companion, to either some other activity or to a more focused journey into of the further reaches of consciousness. And where the dream-driven music scenes that McGuire sometimes finds himself lumped in with can feel like a bummed-out retro hangover, this music is almost uniformly positive and optimistic, seeming to celebrate the restorative possibilities of elemental chord changes, repetition, and carefully sculpted textures. It's music that wants to find its way into your life and do some good, and I can't think of any good reason to resist it.</p></div>"|15420.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15420-a-young-persons-guide-to-mark-mcguire/|8.2|Mark Richardson

They aren't just vaguely reminiscent of Love or the Seeds or <i>Out of Our Heads</i>-era Stones, they're practically the spitting image, scuzzy and scrappy and, most of all, urgent. That last one they nail time and again on <i>Sons of Stone</i>, their rollicking debut. Though the sounds they mine may be familiar, they hit on the same quality that makes <i>Nuggets</i>-era rock'n'roll so exciting: that leave-it-on-the-line feeling that these guys are putting a summer's worth of lawnmowing money at risk to lay this racket down.</p>
<p>Cramming 14 songs in just over 40 minutes, the People's Temple get a lot done in a small space. Melodies skew and sputter, and there's a muscular, MC5-style proto-punk grind to a few of these tunes that underlines the band's Michigan roots. Frontman William Young's got a voice as familiar as his band's sound; he's Arthur Lee one minute, Sky Saxon the next, with a little Iggy and Mick on the songs that call for it. Despite its brief runtime and shambolic sonics, there's a sense of scale and dynamism at play that sometimes suggests the Who's grander late-60s material, and hints of Spacemen 3 drone and Brian Jonestown Massacre's anything-goes whirl pop up. All this lends their taut songcraft a certain richness without shattering its heady throwback vibe.</p>
<p>But to get bogged down in the details of <i>Sons of Stone</i> is to miss its point: This is a juiced-up, manic, genuinely fun rock'n'roll record powered more by the urgency of its forebears than any specific sonic similarities. It takes opener ""Sons of Stone"" a second or two to get going, but once its guitars start to wind around each other, you're caught in its tangle. The rumbly melody of Love-like ""Led as One (Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum)"" is a real brain-sticker, and when Young does his call on jangler ""Visions of the Sun"", the urge to respond is simply too great. Sneaky melodies rendered at insistent tempos seem to pour out of these guys, and their passion is palpable; what they've tapped into here feels almost primal. So while <i>Sons of Stone</i> is a throwback record, it's not a stodgy retread; it strikes an electrifying balance, recreating not just an era's sound, but its spirit.</p></div>"|15423.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15423-sons-of-stone/|7.8|Paul Thompson

<p>Lots of people have been noticing OFWGKTA lately, though, and no wonder: They're new and exciting and divisive and youthful, a magnet for controversy and commentary, and near-perfect think-piece-generating machines-- due in part to the brutality and stomach-turning sexual violence of their raps. At the fore of OFWGKTA's 10-member army is Tyler, the Creator, whose feral stage presence, distinctive growl, and misanthropic lyrics have won the group a legion of obstinate followers. His 2009 debut, <a href=""http://oddfuture.tumblr.com/post/408774636/tyler-creator-bastard"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span><i>Bastard</i></span></a>, with its lush, Neptunes-inspired productions and starkly confessional subject matter, is a transgressive, creative burst of anxiety and absurdity. It was one of Odd Future's early catalysts, and along with 16-year-old Earl Sweatshirt's <i>Earl </i>and the OFWGKTA mixtape <i>Radical</i>, it's one of three underground classics in their pocket.</p>
<p>While critics have attempted to square Tyler's talent with the frequent mentions of rape and murder in his rhymes (Sean Fennessey <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7863-the-b-boys-odd-future-and-the-swag-generation/"" target=""_blank"">wrote a piece for Pitchfork</a> early on, and <a href=""http://agrammar.tumblr.com/post/4166624859/odd-future-energy-inclusion-and-exclusion"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this blog post</a> by Pitchfork contributor Nitsuh Abebe is also essential), fans have pushed his number of Twitter followers well into six figures. And between he and Hodgy Beats' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15431-sandwitches-live-on-late-night-with-jimmy-fallon/"" target=""_blank"">performance</a> on ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon"" and his excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12112-yonkers/"" target=""_blank"">""Yonkers""</a> single and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15412-yonkers/"" target=""_blank"">video</a>, the industry noticed, too: <i>Billboard</i> put OFWGKTA on their <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/features/odd-future-the-billboard-cover-story-1005062312.story#/features/odd-future-the-billboard-cover-story-1005062312.story"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover</a>, a major label secured them to a record deal, and Diddy, Kanye, and Jay-Z all showed interest. Odd Future have earned so much attention so quickly that Tyler, the Creator kicks off his second solo release, <i>Goblin</i>, venting to his therapist about fame, message boards, critics, hype, expectations, media scrutiny, and being a role model-- before selling a single album.</p>
<p>There are a lot of expectations placed on <i>Goblin</i>,<i> </i>namely, that it will serve as a potential crossover. But while that might have been the hope for a lot of those industry co-signers, or even a lot of listeners, it's clearly not Tyler's intention. <i>Goblin</i> does not sound like a record made by the goofy, smiling kid with the pulled-up tube socks riding Jimmy Fallon's back. Instead, it's a natural sequel to <i>Bastard</i>-- a dark, insular indie-rap album. Where <i>Bastard</i> was more accessible and inviting, this album is bleak, long, monolithic, and can be a slog to get through. It's also uncomfortable and brave-- a brutal but honest look at Tyler's image of himself.</p>
<p>Musically, <i>Goblin</i> is essentially a turn-of-the-millennium indie rap record-- abstract, difficult for outsiders to locate a way in to, and bled completely of anything that resembles pop. It features almost nothing that counts as a chorus, making few gestures to the mainstream. It's a purist's record, leaning on inventive production and Tyler's flow and meter. With hindsight, then, it makes sense that the rise of Odd Future started in the avant UK music mag <i>The Wire</i>, which a decade ago was putting leftfield rap groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/781-clouddead/"" target=""_blank"">cLOUDDEAD</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/104-anti-pop-consortium/"" target=""_blank"">Anti-Pop Consortium</a> on its cover. In another world, before the Internet was the music industry's central delivery system, that might have been the limit of <i>Goblin</i>'s reach-- it could have been a well-received indie hip-hop record to place alongside releases on Def Jux or Anticon. (Fittingly, it comes via XL Records, the imprint that last decade signed Dizzee Rascal, another culturally omnivorous, incredibly hyped teen rapper and producer who added a new wrinkle to independent hip-hop.)</p>
<p>Of course, Tyler isn't interested in the political questions that drove many of his indie-rap forbearers. Instead, his primary mode of thought is negation. From the Stooges to Sex Pistols to NWA to Eminem, telling the world to fuck itself can be a compelling, even meaningful or necessary expression. Yet while each of those artists gave a multi-layered voice to specific disenfranchised groups, Tyler sounds underdeveloped when he attempts to articulate for anyone other than himself. His takes on slash-and-burn, knucklehead rap-- especially the ""kill people, burn shit, fuck school"" refrain of ""Radicals""-- is particularly cringe-worthy; stock phrases shouted with no larger purpose. <i>Goblin</i> is at its best when Tyler sounds isolated, frightened, and confused. It's the work of someone trying to figure out the world around him and his place within it, someone who often doesn't like the conclusions he's drawing.</p>
<p>To his core fans, Tyler is accessible and approachable, and not just on record. He's online constantly, forging a unique bond with his listeners, and is probably right now shouting down this and other <i>Goblin </i>reviews. He comes across as an everyday kid. He lives with his grandmother. He likes porn; he hates collard greens. This relatability and strong audience/artist bond, and the diaristic nature of his rhymes, make him as much emo as hip-hop. His place in the indie music landscape is oddly most reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27383-salem/"" target=""_blank"">Salem</a>, another gothic, often-derided group beloved by a core of committed young listeners but shrugged off by those with a more developed perspective. In short, he's made this record for alienated kids like himself. If you don't already like his music, you probably won't like <i>Goblin</i>. And that's apparently the way he wants it.</p>
<p>For everyone else, the album remains an either/or prospect. For one, the record could have used an editor-- it'd be stronger if it were 20 minutes shorter. <span>Yet the highs are very high</span>: ""Yonkers"" remains a potential frontrunner for song-of-the-year, and tracks like ""Sandwitches"", ""Analog"", ""Tron Cat"", and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"">Frank Ocean</a> feature ""She"" work as standalones away from the album as a whole. Tyler's most inwardly focused songs-- the therapy-session set pieces ""Goblin"", ""Nightmare"", and ""Golden""-- are also fascinating portraits from an unmoored mind struggling to remain grounded.</p>
<p>The record's feeling of drift and desperation also lends a very different tone to the controversial nature of Tyler's raps, which even at their most sickening feel like the ramblings of a lonely outsider. His fantasies and lack of filter are still huge roadblocks for many if not most listeners. They're depraved and despicable, tied in part to a long and unfortunate legacy of gangster and street rap. They're also one aspect of a larger, character-driven story-- a license that we grant to visual arts, film, and literature but rarely to pop music. That's not to claim Tyler is making some broader commentary about the world, or gender politics, or adding multiple layers of complexity to his more violent thoughts; he's not. Instead, his more reprehensible lines come across like a pathetic attempt for an underdeveloped, disconnected mind to locate some emotionality, control, or simply attention.</p>
<p>They certainly aren't jokes for his friends-- there's not a lot of humor on <i>Goblin</i>. The album really compartmentalizes the group's darkness and confusion, which makes sense because Odd Future guys like Frank Ocean and Domo Genesis usually weren't expressing anger or violence anyway. You sort of get the feeling-- since they are officially a package deal now-- that the weed stuff or the laughing-with-your-friends stuff might come out in a group effort. And even here, when other Odd Future members join Tyler, they tend to let a little light into the album-- particularly the Hodgy Beats pairings ""Sandwitches"" and ""Analog"". The coziness and camaraderie between Tyler and his cohorts even meets with a nasty end on <i>Goblin</i>, which concludes with a suite of tracks in which Tyler inexplicably kills his friends before suffering a total emotional breakdown.</p>
<p>What is here is more promise than delivery, yet it's still a game-changing record for indie hip-hop-- a singular and sonically complex album neither in hoc to 1986-88 ""real"" hip-hop nor created by rappers aiming to define themselves in opposition to the mainstream. (It takes about three minutes for Tyler to align himself with other artists here, but he chooses Erykah Badu, Pusha T, and Waka Flocka Flame instead of Immortal Technique.) Alongside Lil B and Soulja Boy, OFWGKTA are harnessing the Internet to communicate directly and often and pushing a new kind of indie hip-hop-- often rambling, not always musical, frequently surprising, and absolutely beloved by some. It takes work to get through, and a lot of its success rests on cult of personality. Those two barriers are particularly why it's so successful: You have to commit to it in many ways. You have to want to be an insider. And that's a club that's quickly expanding.</p></div>"|15413.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15413-goblin/|8.0|Scott Plagenhoef

That's a surprising response to a record that lyrically keys on the transience of existence, the failures of our best efforts, and the high costs of man's lowly sexual instincts. But my chuckle was the delirious sort, based on my own addled exhaustion. That's how <i>Diotima </i>works: Unapologetically extreme and intense, it's the most relentless album from a hyper-dexterous band that's never been one to take it easy. Though it's not the longest Krallice album (that's<i> Dimensional Bleedthrough</i>, slightly), <i>Diotima</i> forgoes the long-short-long tack of previous Krallice efforts, creating marathons out of marathons that demand complete attention and destroy attention spans.</p>
<p>During ""Intraum"", from 2008's <i>Dimensional Bleedthrough</i>, Krallice took a break from their four-piece hustle. Guitarists Mick Barr and Colin Marston ricocheted through quick, countering riffs until the sound sublimated into a restless seven-minute drone. It's an off-ramp ahead of the album's appropriately titled 19-minute closer, ""Monolith of Possession"", a long-form roar whose pummeling is precise and seemingly perpetual. Halfway through, you realize just how much that pause meant. Nearly 10 minutes into ""Telluric Rings"", <i>Diotima</i>'s penultimate track, you can hear Krallice reaching for the same rest-stop trick. It stands to be a well-deserved rest, too, as ""Telluric Rings"" is the fourth and final consecutive track on <i>Diotima</i> to race past the 12-minute mark. What's more, it's written as a lyrical sequel to the preceding ""Litany of Regrets"", meaning that, when Lev Weinstein's drums finally snap out here, it ends a mostly seamless 22-minute cavalcade. But don't rest easy: Marston and Barr noodle and slink for about 80 seconds, summoning a dark radiance with sheaths of distortion. Weinstein blasts back in, and the track's last 90 seconds offer a raze as energetic and complete as any in the band's discography. So brutal and mean, the track's closing blur is a perfectly executed nexus between grindcore and black metal, as cathartic as it is crushing.</p>
<p><i>Diotima</i>'s glory is often in its details. It has fewer stops, starts, and redirections than its predecessors. Rather, the big shifts are now often misleadingly subtle and slight, created more by the way the musicians move against and with each other than how the band moves as a unit. In theory, it's not unlike studying a Steve Reich phase piece, where patterns show themselves best when their relationships with one another change. Or, as <a href=""http://heavymetal.about.com/od/interviews/a/Krallice-Interview.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">McMaster explained to Chad Bowar</a>, ""Essentially, we wanted to have more unison parts, to amplify the contrast between when we'd all play the same riff and when the guitars and bass would split off into independent lines.""</p>
<p><span>Indeed, this is the first album on which McMaster has written all of his bass parts, and his unexpected risks make this thundering gauntlet worth hearing at high volume, with high-end headphones. During ""Inhume"", for instance, the quartet is playing in strict unison when McMaster steps out of the pack, adding low, lumbering lines that sandbag the whole section. It’s a smart redirection, a moment worth hearing again and again. It’s technical black metal that thankfully never puts its own technicality above the bold ideas in its songs.</span></p>
<p><i>Diotima</i> has broadly accessible glimpses: The central riff in ""The Clearing"" supplies all the majesty and power of a Sousa march-- memorable enough to hum, triumphant enough for pumped fists. <a href=""http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/140330-krallice-diotima/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Writing for Pop Matters,</a> Adrien Begrand correctly called the title track ""genuinely catchy"" as it moves from ""a cruising sludge groove... [into] the frenzied blast beats we know so well from these guys."" But the album's emphasis on movement within the songs and within the parts makes it ultimately less dynamic and dramatic, at least on initial listens; the obvious bloodlust of <i>Dimensional Bleedthrough</i> comes funneled into a full assault that might be mistaken for monotony, especially compared to the latest by Brooklyn black metal brethren Liturgy. That's too bad, though, as Krallice's levels of composition and performance have never been higher-- so high, in fact, it's laughable.</p></div>"|15419.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15419-diotima/|7.6|Grayson Currin

Many of the best songs Earle's written find him telling the story of some real or imagined person who has either endured an injustice or been widely demonized or misunderstood. A badass with a bleeding heart, Earle has lent compassion to criminals (""Billy Austin"", ""Tom Ames' Prayer"", ""John Walker's Blues"") as well as given voice to the kinds of disenfranchised people who rarely have one (""Good Ol Boy (Gettin' Tough)"", ""Taneytown"", ""Home From Houston""). Almost all of these are protest songs to some degree, yet by putting a face to an issue and getting you to sympathize with his subject's plight, it never feels like Earle is preaching.</p>
<p>The clear highlight of Earle's 14th studio album, <i>I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive</i>, is ""The Gulf of Mexico"", and it fits this mold flawlessly. As you've probably guessed from the title, the underlying issue is the Gulf oil spill, but instead of soapboxing about corporate irresponsibility, Earle illuminates the history of the region by sketching the lives of three generations of men who worked its waters. We meet the narrator's grandfather running a shrimp boat, the father ferrying workers to and from the mighty oil rigs, and then finally the storyteller himself, working on the drilling floor and witness to the catastrophic explosion that ""spilled the guts of hell out on the gulf of Mexico."" As the three verses progress, the water turns from blue to green to red.</p>
<p>Earle seems to feed off this sense of righteous purpose-- on this album, see also ""Little Emperor"", a giddy skewering of American hubris. When his subject matter is more nebulous, stylized, or even personally intimate, his songwriting tends to falter. ""Molly-O"", ""Meet Me in the Alleyway"", and ""The Wanderer"" lean too heavily on tropes of the outlaw, the gritty urban denizen and the vagabond, respectively, while trading on the listener's recognition that Earle himself has been categorized in those roles. Conversely, the gentle sentiments of ""God Is God"" and ""Every Part of Me"" are deeply felt but hardly profound. It doesn't help that Earle isn't a particularly strong melodist, and rarely will surprise you musically-- here, only ""Lonely Are the Free"", delicately decorated with acoustic guitar fills, truly measures up to his top-line lyricism. His most effortless mode is charging, attitudinal roots-rock, but only the opening ""Waitin' on the Sky"" really hits that strutting sweet spot.</p>
<p>Earle's albums have been extremely uneven for some time now. Certainly that indicates he's put out a sizable amount of dross, but it also means he's recorded a bunch of great songs that have gotten lost in the shuffle. It's particularly galling that no compilation of Earle's work released to date has included any post-1997 material. Perhaps the ideal representation of his artistry would be a collection of his best cause-minded story songs. It'd be like a musical version of Howard Zinn's <i>A People's History of the United States</i>, and ""The Gulf of Mexico"" would definitely be on there.</p></div>"|15421.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15421-ill-never-get-out-of-this-world-alive/|5.8|Joshua Love

There's ""brostep,"" of which nothing more need be said. Some artists took the ""dub"" mandate literally and constructed a world of midnight, alienated electronic music, best exemplified by the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/labels/1920-hyperdub/"">Hyperdub</a> label. A third, diffuse group borrowed the movement's rhythmic syncopations and set upon exploring the vast stylistic implications of bass in electronic music. Some of the finest music in the latter camp has found a home on Paul Rose's UK-based <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=hotflush&amp;search_type=standard"">Hotflush Recordings</a>; <i>Back and 4th </i>is Hotflush's second label compilation, featuring a disc of unmixed hits of and another of new material from its still-small roster.</p>
<p>The big names here will be recognizable to anyone paying a modicum of attention to UK electronic music: Mount Kimbie, Joy Orbison (now Joy O), and Untold all feature, as well as less prominent but still productive names like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14076-triangulation/"">Scuba</a> (Rose himself) and Pangaea. Hotflush's output has always felt warmer than their more claustrophobic peers, and <i>Back and 4th </i>is inviting-- full of bobbing, circular rhythms and august synths. On the whole, it's more immediate than Hyperdub's excellent (and similarly constructed) <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13614-5-five-years-of-hyperdub/"">5</a>; </i>the mood is glum and contemplative, but you won't need to uncrate your personal paranoia to best enjoy it.</p>
<p>The hits disc cuts a limited swath through Hotflush's catalog, but it's a boon both to those who haven't diligently collected tracks like Mount Kimbie's ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11872-maybes-james-blake-remix/"">Maybes (James Blake Remix)</a>"" and Joy Orbison's ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11461-hyph-mngo/"">Hyph Mngo</a>"" and anyone who hasn't been replaying them faithfully. A homespun mix of ashy, melodic techno would hardly do better, and the slightest bit of hindsight reveals
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
that these tracks have as much in common with late 1990s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/labels/136-warp/"">Warp</a> and, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4285-tricky/"">Tricky</a> as anything that could rightfully be called dubstep.</p>
<p>The disc of new material is a mixed bag. Thematically similar, the new tracks rely more heavily on corroded vocal samples and brisk tempos. Disappointingly, there's nothing fresh from Mount Kimbie, Untold, or Joy O. Instead, Hotflush showcases newer talent and signees, rolling out tracks from dBridge (an artist involved in the awesomely named Autonomic movement that purports to be re-imagining drum and bass), FaltyDL (""Regret""'s widescreen arbors are a career highlight), and the promising George FitzGerald. Like Scuba's work, the new material leans heavily on deep house conventions: sturdy, insistent kick drums and lean, melodic hooks. Incyde's ""Axis"" and Boxcutter's ""LOADtime"" play like dance music set through a brush of heavy burrs, bristling and itching their way to release (a natural progression, perhaps, from Joy O's dense loops). The disc is a letdown only inasmuch as none of these tracks are likely to migrate to a ""hits"" disc on a theoretical future compilation.</p>
<p>Not anchored by history, the new disc meanders. Hyperdub's equivalent compilation was a synthesis, something to rally around; <i>Back and 4th </i>promises something more-- a roster of expressionists redefining bass music-- but delivers less. Instead, it<i> </i>reminds us just how formative and vital tracks like ""Maybes"" were, but it only hints from where Hotflush's next breakthrough will come.</p></div>"|15396.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15396-back-and-4th/|7.2|Andrew Gaerig

Unlike Diplo or even Girl Talk, though, Chrissy isn't interested in connecting his genre obsessions with modern North American hip-hop or  R&amp;B, meaning <i>Women's Studies</i> features no hint of pop crossover. It's the difference between believing something like dancehall deserves a wider audience and believing dancehall is just <i>really fucking cool</i>.</p>
<p>Chrissy cut his teeth on rave, and <i>Women's Studies</i> bears the marks of 1990s dance culture: airhorns abound, as do the skittering 180-bpm rush of drum &amp; bass and hi-NRG's gloriously tasteless synths. Genres are important to Murderbot (he's behind the outstanding <a href=""http://yearofmixtapes.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">yearofmixtapes.blogspot.com</a>, a site that featured a micro-genre DJ mix every week for a year); he's not interested in perfectly melding his influences into the Chrissy Murderbot Sound™. When he blows an airhorn, he wants you to think of glowsticks, or at least to think of an iPhone glowstick app (<a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iglowstick/id319569885?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">you're welcome</a>). The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/#/music-videos/1605-chrissy-murderbot/2542-bussin-down-ft-dj-spinn/"">video for lead single ""Bussin Down""</a>, which features Murderbot and DJ Spinn playing a dance-battle version of <i>Street Fighter</i>, isn't exactly coy about Murderbot's 90s-culture fanaticism.</p>
<p>The Chicago-based Murderbot has been an early, vocal advocate for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14985-bangs-works-vol-1-a-chicago-footwork-compilation/"">Footwork</a>. He's curates an excellent monthly dance party (Loose Squares, also the name of a label he's putting together) that regularly features Footwork and juke legends on the decks. <i>Women's Studies</i> borrows those hypnotic samples and Dance Mania's ruff vulgarity and is Murderbot's most focused work almost by default. Naturally he's not content simply mimicking, so he sets Footwork against cheesy lounge-jazz (""Bussin' Down""),  or late-90s Warp skittering (""Jiggle""). Not only is Murderbot not above deliciously boilerplate dance mantras, they're basically his wheelhouse. Tracks ""The Vibe Is So Right"" and ""U Got Me Burnin Up (Club Cirque)"" fit him so well because he's so eager and utterly unashamed.</p>
<p>The flip side to any discussion about how much energy Chrissy brings is how much energy it takes to listen to him. <i>Women's Studies</i> is relentlessly uptempo, and Murderbot's idea of a pop hook is Warrior Queen's heavily accented, aggressive cadence. The vocals and guests sometimes feel tacked-on, perhaps in deference to original scenes and styles. (Even on a party record you know you're in trouble when Johnny Moog is dropping lines like, ""What seperates me from y'all lames is I'm like Young Jeezy."" Oh. That's what.)</p>
<p>It's easy to be cynical about this kind of musical colonialism, but Murderbot is effectively a man without a genre/country, and besides, he approaches his source material with nothing but love. I finally feel like he's gotten a bit lucky, with his most recent fascination (Footwork) coinciding with a rise in that fascination's profile. <i>Women's Studies</i> is a tiring listen by design, and its 43-minute runtime is the only bone thrown at the listener. Murderbot could conceivably do more to smooth out his productions, but what he wants to do is duct-tape his record collection together and find pleasure at the resulting contraption. If you share his obsessions-- or are merely curious about them-- you're invited to smile and dance with him.</p></div>"|15415.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15415-womens-studies/|7.0|Andrew Gaerig

Anderson has <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41801-rising-ema/"">talked</a> about finding ""true bliss and terror"" in the live performances of her former band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5505-gowns/"">Gowns</a>. The pressure-cooker atmosphere she and her partner in that group (and in life) Ezra Buchla immersed themselves in had to crack at some point, and it did, fatally and finally, at the beginning of 2010. Anderson's way of propping open an escape hatch from the bruised purging of Gowns was to retreat into herself, by gathering her collective musical ideas and putting them out under her own initials. But it's immediately apparent on hearing <i>Past Life Martyred Saints</i><span>, her debut full-length as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29348-ema/"">EMA</a>, that she's still all tangled up in ""bliss and terror."" For the most part, it's a white-knuckle ride. There's no pretense or pose here. No pulling back from the brink to foster an air of cool detachment. Anderson's music has the power to plummet to the depths and drag you right down there with her.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There's a lack of timidity in the way this music is expressed. It's almost as though Anderson snoozed her way through the past decade and is picking up threads that have mostly lain dormant since the early-to-mid 1990s. The boldness in her language, which thematically pings back and forth between emotional and physical duress, has the same naked volatility as <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Babes+in+Toyland"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kat Bjelland</a> circa <i>Spanking Machine</i><span> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6162-hole/"">Courtney Love</a> in her </span><i>Pretty on the Inside</i><span> phase. It's often terrifying, distressing stuff. There's a feeling that you're watching someone in the midst of several life crises. It's a strange kind of testament to </span><i>Past Life Martyred Saints</i><span> that it often feels like a daunting proposition to listen to, as if spending too much time with it will leave you as scarred as its creator.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The lyrical fixations here frequently zoom in on <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000343/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cronenberg-ian body horror</a>, with Anderson exploring the gnarly elasticity of the human frame when it's placed under threat. EMA songs often duck into little mantras; ""Butterfly Knife"" bears one of the most unnerving of those in its ""20 kisses with a butterfly knife"" line. ""Marked"" is similarly nauseating and obsessed with physical abuse. Over a noise that sounds like water chugging down rusty steel piping Anderson devolves into repeating: ""I wish that every time he touched me he left a mark."" It dwells in the same kind of unsettling territory as Goffin/King's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9RuP1QMXOs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""He Hit Me (It Felt Like a Kiss)""</a>, and the bare-bones musical arrangement heightens the severity of the message just as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8663-phil-spector/"">Phil Spector</a>'s production did on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8548-the-crystals/"">Crystals</a>' song.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That ability for her arrangements to acutely reflect her lyrical mood is one of Anderson's trump cards. She knows exactly when to add and subtract elements, bringing ""Marked"" out of the doldrums at its close with a warm organ tone that she deploys whenever things get a little too heavy (see also: ""Milkman""). The opening <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12092-the-grey-ship/"">""The Grey Ship""</a> is one of her most ambitious conceits in that regard. It shifts in style several times, from its earthy, folk-y opening to a midsection where all the instrumentation vanishes suddenly as if the bottom just fell out of the world.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It's a sign of her confidence and ambition that she can open the record with such a multi-faceted song, full of odd diversions and unexpected twists that need multiple plays to really sink in. But the hit-rate here is high. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12152-california/"">""California""</a> is among Anderson's best works, a stream-of-consciousness rant about displacement and alienation set to a musical backing that feels like civilization collapsing around her. ""California"" shows off her enviable talent for finding a comfortable place where big-topic sloganeering and personal tales can coexist. It's that sweat-soaked head-rush of repulsion, sadness, anxiety, and nostalgia you get when you feel the tug of home.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>Past Life Martyred Saints </i><span>is a fiercely individual record, made by a musician with a fearless and courageous approach to her art. Crucially, the desire to let such raw emotion out in song never feels forced. It simply wouldn't work this well if there was a hint of artifice, or a suggestion that Anderson hadn't regurgitated all these feelings of loss, loathing, and rejection from a pit of genuinely volatile emotion. There's a conviction to her delivery that leaves you in no doubt that this is something she needed to flush out of her system. Comparisons can certainly be drawn to artists such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3842-patti-smith/"">Patti Smith</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"">Cat Power</a>, and her dry, deadpan delivery occasionally orbits the same sphere as Kim Gordon's vocal work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a>. But this is Anderson's own brittle unease. It hits as hard as a cold slap in the face-- and will leave its mark on you.</span></p></div>"|15386.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15386-past-life-martyred-saints/|8.5|Nick Neyland

Clams (real name Mike Volpe) even echoed this sentiment in a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/42015-rising-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">recent interview</a> with us, suggesting that he enjoyed doing vocal-less work more, partly because of the logistical hurdles involved in linking up with MCs. ""The beats just sit around for months. It's frustrating... Now, all I want to do is put out instrumental stuff,"" he said.</p>
<p>So it's no surprise that his latest release steps away from for-hire beatmaking to showcase original material, five tracks that ""have always existed purely as instrumentals,"" according to a press statement. Put out by the well-curated boutique imprint Tri Angle, the <i>Rainforest</i> EP is centered loosely on a terrestrial theme (song titles ""Waterfalls"" and ""Treetop"" not-so-subtly reference nature) and carefully balances some very earthy, textural sounds with more airy, celestial ones. For example, a track like opener ""Natural"" explores the tension between a tattered, grainy arrangement and float-y, angelic vocal samples-- you can feel it pulling you in both directions.</p>
<p>These aren't groundbreaking techniques (this production style owes something to West Coast instrumental hip-hop as well as guys like Four Tet and Burial), but Clams' detailed, musical approach makes them feel like his own. He just does a lot of things right: Vocal samples, which are treated to sound sort of ghostly and haunting, are picked at their most expressive moments, and his sense of build-and-release gives the tracks a momentum that never lets them become too drifty. The lurching first single, ""Gorilla"", shows his knack for this kind of thrust: Occasionally he'll drop the beat off for a second, letting things go creepily silent, and then bring a cluster of drums back in for a big payoff.</p>
<p>Clams displays on each of these songs this gift for melody and contrast, going blissful on ""Waterfalls"" and then into more sinister ambient territory on a track like ""Drowning"". Ultimately the EP is tough to categorize, since it has a clear hip-hop undercurrent but feels more in line with the mixed-genre experimental electronic work of someone like (Tri Angle labelmate) Balam Acab. But it's an impressive, colorful set of tunes that is arguably the best thing this label has put out, next to How to Dress Well's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14678-love-remains/"" target=""_blank"">debut LP</a>. And after two very good records in the span of just a couple of months, it might make the case for Clams, who has stressed in interviews that he does music only as a hobby, to go full-time-- <i>Rainforest</i> feels like an artist confidently finding his niche.</p></div>"|15416.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15416-rainforest-ep/|8.2|Joe Colly

Their panoramic electro-acoustic music is made from slow layers of processed acoustic instruments and patient drones that slide against each other at independent paces and with the single-mindedness of natural processes. They usually avoid loops in favor of a continual unspooling, so that the individual components of their tracks have no clear beginnings and endings, just hitches and knots here and there. They portray a great deal of motion within superstructures that seem to stand utterly still. Negative space is diligently sought out and eradicated, until we can hear the computer age gently swallowing folk music whole.</p>
<p>Up through 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12698-choral/"" target=""_blank""><i>Choral</i></a>, Mountains used home computer software to transform their acoustic instrumentation, which runs the gamut from spindly guitars and pianos to suffusing cellos, accordions, and melodicas. But for <i>Air Museum</i>, they headed into a Brooklyn studio with an analog arsenal of pedals and modular synthesizers to record in real time. The result is a newfound energy and dynamism that comes at a price. At their best, Mountains balance their systems so delicately that different layers float seamlessly to the top at different times. They pull that off here on songs like ""January 17"", where a modem-like melody that recalls vintage electronic ambient rises and falls through a slow-motion landslide of long tones. But sometimes, the new emphasis on hard-edged electronic pulses, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1862-growing/"">Growing</a>-style, upsets the equilibrium.</p>
<p>I'm thinking specifically of ""Thousand Square"" and ""Sequel"". Both have mighty tectonic shifts to recommend them, but their fat, rubbery, skipping electronics tend to run roughshod over the finer calibrations, and the compositions lose something in subtlety and mystery. The walls don't just breathe; they hyperventilate. These songs really drive home the feeling that <i>Choral</i>, where the electronics acted as enclosing suspensions for the instruments, has been turned inside out, and not to its benefit. On the other hand, the stronger electronic presence works great on ""Blue Lanterns on East Oxford"", where sharply angled but well-balanced motifs slice through each other with an almost dubstep wobble, so no one part dominates the whole. And to be working on such a wide screen, Mountains are great at maintaining tension-- their tracks never feel aimless or inert, even at their most toweringly monumental, like on <i>Air Museum'</i>s ""Newsprint"". So if you liked <i>Choral</i>, here it is with more of everything, for better and for worse.</p></div>"|15409.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15409-air-museum/|6.9|Brian Howe

He's been in bands since the mid-1970s, and for 32 years was Nick Cave's chief officer, helping to define the sound of the Birthday Party and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"" target=""_blank"">the Bad Seeds</a> as a musical director, arranger, and multi-instrumentalist. He left the Bad Seeds in early 2009 for the usual reasons people leave bands at age 50-- more time with family, simmering creative differences, and a general desire for change and control. From the 90s onward, Harvey has not lacked for work outside of Cave's sphere, working with PJ Harvey, producing other bands, writing soundtracks, and cutting solo albums, but <i>Sketches From the Book of the Dead</i> is his first solo album recorded without the safety net of any members of the Bad Seeds.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">It's also his first solo album to feature only songs composed by Harvey himself-- until now, he's focused mostly on other people's songs, including two full LPs of English-language Serge Gainsbourg covers. Harvey plays most of the instruments on the album, and it has the understated feel of a quiet and personal project, not unlike his last solo album, 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10586-two-of-diamonds/"" target=""_blank""><i>Two of Diamonds</i></a>. In both his solo work and his work with Cave, Harvey has had plenty of experience with dusty murder ballads, and he creates a few of his own here, giving his doomed characters names and histories.</p>
<p>The most fully fleshed-out of these characters is the title character of ""The Ballad of Jay Givens"", whose story Harvey tells from the perspective of the son of Givens' best friend. In a twist on the murder ballad formula, Givens doesn't kill the narrator's father after the father steals Givens' wife-- he takes his own life instead, which somehow makes it much more tragic. Harvey keeps the song hushed and dark, his deep voice sometimes falling to a whisper. Aside from the up-tempo closer, ""Famous Last Words"", that's the feel that prevails across the album-- icy piano and organ infuse nearly every song with a hanging sense of dread and impending fate.</p>
<p>The album's atmospheric consistency is generally a plus, but it would work better if Harvey's songs had stronger melodies. The album's most memorable moments are mostly just that, parts of songs that stand out for the way they briefly change things up, such as the sudden, haunting swell at the end of ""Frankie T. &amp; Frankie C."". The best song on the album is the one that strings the most of these moments together: ""The Bells Never Rang"" has the strongest vocal melody on the album, combined with a good arrangement that constantly shifts intensity to pull you through. It's a tantalizing glimpse of how great solo Harvey can be, but unfortunately, a good deal of the rest of the album is simply unmemorable.</p></div>"|15380.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15380-sketches-from-the-book-of-the-dead/|6.3|Joe Tangari

He had been strangled and beaten with an axe. It was the town's first homicide in its 15-year history, and while the culprit was soon apprehended, the incident was a shock to many of the municipality's 10,000 residents. This kind of thing wasn't supposed to happen in Celebration, which had been founded by Disney specifically to be a crime-free, family-friendly throwback to a way of life that's more imagined than actual. It's unclear whether the Felice Brothers knew of that that crime when they named their fourth album <i>Celebration, Florida</i>, but certainly that dark spot on the town's sunny exterior adds a bit of sensationalism to these songs, which examine the dark side of American spectacle.
<p>As with the album title, this Woodstock band chooses its proper nouns carefully, painting a glaring portrait of America full of Wonder Bread warehouses, used '96 Honda Civics, the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, and televisions turned to Fox 5 News. It's ersatz culture defined by its detritus, and it recalls the odd cityscapes of East River Pipe. The Felice Brothers lack F.M. Cornog's sense of wonder, which depicts even the most banal details as the stuff of science fiction. Nothing on <i>Celebration</i> is quite so transformative, but there are imaginative stories in these songs, populated with real characters checking the sticker price, lying to the desk clerk, and arguing with the TV.</p>
<p>The Felice Brothers try to reflect this American jumble in their music, which draws from 60s folk rock (their Woodstock is more <i>The Basement Tapes </i>than <i>Woodstock</i>) and general roots traditions without being specific enough to belong to any particular short-lived revival. They're tinkerers, reimagining Americana as something in flux, steeped in history yet absorbing new ideas. ""Ponzi"" bursts into a chaotic rumble of programmed beats and industrial stutter, linking Wall Street to the introverted grotesquerie of Nine Inch Nails rat
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
her than the self-conscious luster of hip-hop. Conceptually, it's an intriguing idea. Musically, it ruins one of the better tunes on <i>Celebration</i>, a tense, jerky groove that's more intriguing when it threatens to explode than when it actually explodes.</p>
<p>Therein lies the central complaint: The Felice Brothers may be a bit overeager in their experimenting. Perhaps unleashed by the sprawl of the album's theme, they indulge seemingly every whim, from the Auto-Tuned vocals and low-rider high-hat ride on ""Honda Civic"" to the bustling horns and accordion solo on the very same song. <i>Celebration</i> is not only a busy album, but a showy one as well: The songs morph and shift so often that they sound like several songs all at once, which tends to dilute their momentum. ""Oliver Stone"" fades in and out as through carried on a weak signal, until the band turns the dial from one station to the next. Opener ""Fire at the Pageant"", with its raucous shout-along chorus, can't convey that sense of urgency and pandemonium when it keeps stopping to consider itself in the mirror. <i>Celebration, Florida</i> doesn't simply reflect the hubbub of America as the Felice Brothers see it. The album becomes a part of the spectacle, which is surely not what the band intended.</p>

After <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5961-down-the-river-of-golden-dreams/"" target=""_blank"">Down the River of Golden Dreams</a> </i>in 2003, the Austin-based group released two sets of linked records: <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5963-black-sheep-boy/"" target=""_blank"">Black Sheep Boy</a> </i>and <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5964-the-black-sheep-boy-appendix-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Black Sheep Boy Appendix</i></a> both re-imagined Tim Hardin's title song as a phantasmagorical rock'n'roll cautionary tale, full of goat-headed men and hearts literally made of stone. <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10509-the-stage-names/"" target=""_blank"">The Stage Names</a> </i>and <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12176-the-stand-ins/"" target=""_blank"">The Stand Ins</a> </i>played like two installments of a dark tour diary, deconstructing old rock myths and scrawling out new ones. Together, these four albums revealed frontman Will Sheff as one of indie rock's most ambitious thinkers: a romantic anti-romantic weighing highly literate lyrics against an endlessly bleak worldview.</p>
<p>For all its bluster, however, 2008's <i>The Stand Ins</i> suggested Sheff's large-scale ideas were yielding diminishing returns. It was an impressive run that explored the edges of indie-rock songwriting and distinguished Okkervil River from so many of their peers, but it's refreshing that <i>I Am Very Far</i> is a collection of songs-as-statements rather than a collection-of-songs as statement. These 11 tracks sound more like stand-alone efforts rather than pieces of a larger puzzle, even if they do revisit and expound on many of Sheff's pet themes. The thundering war stomp of ""The Valley""-- which opens the album like a pre-ritual incantation-- soundtracks a journey through ""the valley of the rock'n'roll dead,"" which may be Sheff's idea of a summer festival. On ""Hanging From a Hit"", he's saved from the abyss by an earworm, then listens as his married lover describes her marriage: ""I'm too much mine without him,"" she says of her husband. ""I limp from life.""</p>
<p>These songs may be less grounded in familiar settings and predicaments than previous efforts, and therefore a bit more oblique, but lines like those quoted above can be hooks in themselves-- as catchy and sharp as choruses, sticking in your mind as you decode their ambiguities. As a result, Sheff's songs never truly sound settled but remain lively and prickly, especially as various images repeat throughout the album, motifs instead of concepts that suture these songs together. There's a throat in every track, either cut and open or bound to be cut: ""A slit throat makes a note like a raw winter wind,"" he sings on ""The Valley"", adding to its visceral energy. Of course Jagjaguwar is releasing a small chapbook of lyrics as a promo item and part of the deluxe vinyl edition.</p>
<p>More remarkably, however, <i>I Am Very Far </i>manages to put Sheff's lyrics and the band's music on equal footing, creating a monolithic sound whose density resembles the thick block of prose-poem text in the chapbook. Perhaps emboldened by his work on <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14120-true-love-cast-out-all-evil/"" target=""_blank"">Roky Erickson's last album</a>, Sheff produced this record himself, recording in short, intense sessions around the country rather than taking advantage of an extended studio stay. That tactic worked well for their previous albums, but <i>I Am Very Far</i> benefits form the piecemeal approach, which allows Sheff to give each song a distinctive personality and creates a strong dynamic in the sequencing. ""We Need a Myth"" shifts from subtle exotica to towering orchestral rock, while ""Hanging From a Hit"" dissembles it with a quiet dancehall piano, a trumpet solo recorded form out on the boardwalk, and low, lovely gospel harmonies, which are perhaps warmer and more sympathetic for being wordless.</p>
<p>Sheff favors a towering wall of sound on almost every song, in most cases doubling the instruments in the line-up (two drummers, two piano players, etc.) and layering full takes on top of each other. With a density that can be a bit impenetrable and with a heaviness that Okkervil River have only gestured to in the past, <i>I Am Very Far</i> lags in the middle with the staircase-to-nowhere crescendo of ""White Shadow Waltz"" and the rambling ""We Need a Myth"". Sheff recovers with the gut-punch combination of the tense ""Show Yourself"" and ""Your Past Life as a Blast"", a surprisingly affecting paean to a wandering brother (perhaps a sequel to ""A Favor"", from 2004's <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5962-sleep-and-wake-up-songs-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sleep and Wake-Up Songs</i></a> EP). <i>I Am Very Far</i> closes with ""The Rise"", which is constructed around a call-and-response Sheff performs with himself-- a literal doubling borne out of the lyrical themes. The oboe-and-strings orchestration recalls the lush easy listening of the Carpenters, but Okkervil River put it in service to lyrics about forest fires, wounded stags, and the utter loneliness of death. Even so, it comes as a relief that the song doesn't end with a big, fiery finale. Instead, the band lets ""The Rise"" fray apart on its own, a quiet conclusion to a lyrically and musically feisty album.</p></div>"|15410.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15410-i-am-very-far/|7.9|Stephen M.

Perhaps then it is important to note that <i>False Beats and True Hearts</i> is the fourth studio album the duo has recorded in collaboration with guitarist Michio Kurihara, of the psych-folk Japanese powerhouse Ghost. This means that Damon &amp; Naomi have now officially created more music with Kurihara than they ever did with Dean Wareham in Galaxie 500, and over a considerably longer stretch of time. So it seems accurate to say that this, then, is their true music: hushed, vibrant folk-rock punctuated by discreet electric guitar and quiet horns, all of which bear only the most passing resemblance to vintage Galaxie 500.</p>
<p>In the time since Damon &amp; Naomi's previous studio album, 2007's <i>Within These Walls</i>, the duo has kept itself characteristically busy. They've toured the world, released the video anthology <i>1001 Nights</i> and the best-of compilation <i>The Sub Pop Years</i>, and overseen a lavish reissue of the Galaxie 500 catalog on their own 20/20/20 imprint. Given all that activity, it is somewhat surprising to hear how little has changed sonically on <i>False Beats and True Hearts</i>, and the album can give the impression that Damon &amp; Naomi have used the recording process as a way to exhale and re-center themselves creatively.</p>
<p>It's interesting to observe the range of sounds that have now become a regular presence in the duo's work. There was a time when it would have seemed wholly out of character for a Damon &amp; Naomi album to open with a trebly burst of psychedelic guitar, or for one of their songs to feature a languid saxophone solo. But over the course of their past several albums, these elements have become such a familiar component of their music that here at times the duo can sound a bit too comfortable. In addition to Kurihara, the album features guest spots by Ghost's leader Masaki Batoh, trumpet player Greg Kelley, and multi-instrumentalist Bhob Rainey, and there are points where Damon &amp; Naomi's quiet vocals and thoughtful lyrics risk getting lost within their own lush accompaniment.</p>
<p>Damon &amp; Naomi's recent archival activity has provided listeners with an excellent opportunity to investigate their entire musical timeline. The tempos have always been slow, and the volume still tends towards the hushed and intimate, but the overall texture of their music has undergone a gradual change. In Galaxie 500's music, Dean Wareham's voice and guitar, Naomi's melodic bass, and Damon's drums were each given a distinctive role to play, and each stood out in relative isolation in the group's spare production. On <i>False Beats and True Hearts</i>, however, the instruments are allowed to casually blur into one another, with acoustic guitars and piano and reeds uniting to create a single dense weave as Kurihara's hypnotic guitar soars in and out above everything. It's an inviting sound, yet one that often sacrifices sonic fireworks in favor of a general atmosphere of enveloping warmth.</p>
<p>Beneath the album's placid surfaces there is a subtle but persistent tug of melancholy. The Naomi-sung ""How Do I Say Goodbye"" is a direct song of loss and mourning, and nearly every track on the album references the silent passing of time and the invisible power of memory and nostalgia. ""The past is who we are but not what we may become,"" Damon sings on ""Ophelia"", articulating the theme of acceptance that echoes throughout the album. In typical fashion, Damon &amp; Naomi's lyrics on <i>False Beats and True Hearts</i> read very well on the page but don't necessarily lend themselves to immediately memorable choruses or hooks. As with their other work with Michio Kurihara, <i>False Beats and True Hearts</i> is a slow bloom, an album whose rewards can become fully apparent only through thoughtful immersion.</p></div>"|15379.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15379-false-beats-and-true-hearts/|6.9|Matthew Murphy

The German producer-- known primarily for his implicating of biology into techno-- has excelled as a singles artists but has gone to lengths to remind us that his vision of techno does not conform to the sterile, self-serious club paradigm. My favorite work by him, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10078-heimische-gefilde/""><i>Heimische Gefilde</i></a>, is a collection of his best 12""s strung unnecessarily together by hammy nature-doc chatter. His tracks feature recordings of wildlife. There are, of course, the <a href=""http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WvXuUhvtL._SS500_.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">album</a> <a href=""http://media.kompakt.fm/01/assets/releases/fitted/traumv108-eucalypse_now.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covers</a>. A workhorse producer, Dom's creations become overgrown when allowed time. <i>Diorama</i>, his fourth album, is different in this respect. Following an unusually protracted silence (he last dropped a new track in 2009), Eulberg delivers a comparatively composed and well-felt long player.</p>
<p>Eulberg has always made his obsession with nature explicit, but unlike, say, Boards of Canada (obsessed with weirdo library music) or Trentemøller (pure forest-rock), his application isn't stylized; it's clinical. (Said another way: BoC are interested in Kodachrome nostalgia; Eulberg in a butterfly specimen pinned to felt.) Once a part-time forest ranger, Eulberg has dedicated each of <i>Diorama</i>'s 11 tracks to a different aspect of ""domestic nature."" If we understand <i>Diorama</i>'s title literally, these are representations, and I can get there: <i>Diorama</i> feels more detailed, scripted, and painterly than his previous efforts.</p>
<p>No one should conflate Dom's extracurricular interests with an inability to get down: He specializes in four-on-the-floor techno with burr-patch bass and starry synths. At his best, Eulberg produces low-cal trance. His tracks thrive on the friction between horny, acidic low-end and panning, bell-like leads. Rhythms are uncluttered, and he lovingly tweaks them as his tracks begin to buzz and flutter. <i>Diorama</i> features plenty of this (""Das Neunauge""), but there is a greater sense of control. Opener ""Taeuschungs-Blume"" takes Four Tet's breakbeat-laden psychedelia and distends it over the course of five pillowy minutes. On ""Der Tanz der Gluehwuermchen"" he goes to great lengths to prepare us for the skyscraping synth melody that carries the track home; the next track (""Aeronaut"") is a beatific comedown.</p>
<p>Though he crafts long, arching pieces, Dom's music has never featured a narrative, just details. He builds to beauty but not necessarily to climax, and close listening can be exhausting. <i>Diorama</i> is better paced than his previous albums, but it's trance music both stylistically and functionally, abstracted nodding for the thinkers. Nature is a perfect corollary: Delight in its peculiarities, because divining a greater purpose will make your head hurt.</p></div>"|15402.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15402-diorama/|7.2|Andrew Gaerig

Maybe I'm projecting here, though. For all I know, David Kilgour spent grueling hours refining the songs on <i>Left By Soft</i> and rehearsed his band with military discipline, but that doesn't seem likely. The album was recorded in less than a month, close to Kilgour's Dunedin, New Zealand, hometown, with a small band consisting of longtime collaborators Taane Tokona, Thomas Bell, and Tony de Raad. Bell produced the sessions, and like most of Kilgour's solo work, it has a relaxed and quietly accomplished air.</p>
<p>The billing given to the band here, just the second time the Heavy Eights have been listed on a Kilgour album cover, is instructive. These musicians have a good read on Kilgour as a bandleader, and the accompaniment they provide-- and the impression I get from the music-- suggests this was very much a guys-in-a-room recording process. The steady backing lets Kilgour loose to explore with his guitar, and he seizes the opportunity. His lead on ""A Break in the Weather"" sounds barely controlled, as though he's intentionally flirting with chaos before pulling back.</p>
<p>Even on laid-back songs such as the mid-tempo piano ballad ""Autumn Sun"", there's plenty of fuzzy distortion bleeding through. Kilgour is rather unheralded as a guitarist, but in his early days with the Clean in the 1980s, he helped write the book on a ragged approach to playing that can be heard all over indie rock today. On <i>Left By Soft</i>, he seems to be reminding us that he helped stake out this territory. He opens and closes the album with two distinctly different demonstrations of that talent, leading off with strident noisemaking on the title track and ending things with ""Purple Balloon"", where he glides over a breezy beat with a series of offhandedly pretty, clear-toned explorations.</p>
<p>The album as a whole smoothly bridges the ground between these two instrumentals, though it's fair to say that the songwriting on the vocal tracks is overshadowed by the interplay of the band. On ""Could Be on My Way"", Kilgour's lyrics and vocal melody function more as a hook to hang the instrumental on than as a fully-fledged song. But even when the lyrics are more developed, they don't really seem to be the point. This is Kilgour's guitar album, an open showcase for his approach to the instrument.</p></div>"|15392.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15392-left-by-soft/|7.4|Joe Tangari

Given that the album is called <i>Dead to Me</i>, you'd be forgiven for thinking that you were entering into a bleak record of dissonant, droney punk dirges. But after a few seconds, the noise dissipates to make way for a slippery riff that leads into an effortlessly catchy, sun-kissed pop tune.</p>
<p>This musical approach-- sprightly, dewy-eyed, well-played surf-rock-- nods in the direction of escapism, being as though Girls Names hail from the relatively cooler and boardwalk-deprived city of Belfast. The guitar lines are bright, the drumming is usually up-tempo, and frontman Cathal Cully has a particularly romantic croon, deep and robust and subtly emotive. Though the gray of the Belfast sky peek through with the band's ghostly use of reverb, sentimental lyrics like ""shut up and kiss me"" ring the loudest. Their sound is vaguely reminiscent of labelmates Crystal Stilts, minus the psychedelic overtones and the Factory Records gloom that make that band so interesting. Songs like ""I Could Die"" and ""Bury Me"", in spite of their macabre goth titles, are two of the most upbeat songs on the album; in fact, you could rename them ""I Love My Beach Ball"" and ""Every Day is a Party"" and nobody would be the wiser.</p>
<p>With further listens, the feeling of heartbreak in the lyrics starts to set in. The aforementioned song titles and ones like ""Cut Up"" and ""Séance on a Wet Afternoon"" provide a hidden thread to the album, one more haunted than you would originally expect. The occasional specter appears during the song's lyrics, but the images sit side-by-side with scenes from the past and relationships in utter disrepair. With many of Cully's lyrics being tinted with regret, it becomes clear that the ghosts that float throughout <i>Dead to Me</i> represent old lovers cast in the breeze, that the album is actually a break-up record disguised as a concept album about ghosts disguised as the go-to album for indie-loving surfers. Which makes the record a lot more intriguing than it initially lets on.</p>
<p>Only on the closing ""Séance on a Wet Afternoon"" does the trio try a darker approach. The song is driven by Claire Miskimmin's bass and drummer Neil Brogan's nervous tapping of his ride cymbal, evoking the feeling of blazing down a dark, winding road with a paranoid kidnapper at the wheel. Ending with what sounds like a tape spinning off its reel, it's a welcome break from the amorousness of the remainder of the album, which is charming, but may have a harder time finding a place in your record collection during the year's colder months.</p></div>"|15371.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15371-dead-to-me/|7.3|Martin Douglas

Like Arthur Russell before them, they give equal floorspace to the spiritual and the sensual. By those loopy standards, <i>Eye Contact</i>-- the group's latest album-- is Gang Gang Dance's finest, weirdest, and most uplifting statement yet.</p>
<p><i>Eye Contact</i> doesn't kick off so much as it wakes up, easing into existence via 11-minute opener, ""Glass Jar"". Synth and piano arpeggios shine through the stereo field, percolating through a filter of jazz percussion before settling into a propulsive Eastern groove. It's a song about reincarnation. It's ""Darkstar"" and Alice Coltrane and the Boredoms in one blissed-out burst of sound. They're not much of a singles band, though. Gang Gang Dance's vision tends to require a larger, album-length, canvas. Since 2005's <i>God's Money</i>, each of the band's records has played as a single piece-- each song slurring into the next, building toward an ecstatic climax, mirroring the feel of a concert performance or a DJ set. <i>Eye Contact</i> holds to that ideal. Seven songs are strung together into a single composition, bound by abstract ligatures.</p>
<p>But it's an improvement of the formula. On <i>Eye Contact</i>, Gang Gang strike a better balance of song craft and atmosphere. The band's previous record, <i>Saint Dymphna</i>, had admirable futurist-pop ambitions-- collaging elements of hyphy, grime, techno, and contemporary R&amp;B into a psychedelic stew-- but it sometimes came off overcooked. The instrumentals were often bursting with soupy sonic details, while Gang Gang's passes at honest-to-goodness pop-- other than Kate Bush-homage ""House Jam""-- were at times stiff and over-considered.</p>
<p><i>Eye Contact</i> is considerably more relaxed. It's a smooth and moody record. The composed parts are more memorable. The interludes are, well, shorter. Following <i>Dymphna</i>, the band's original drummer, Tim Dewit, parted ways with the group. His distinctive, stuttering rhythms are missed, but his replacement, Jesse Lee-- a steadier and harder hitting player -- brings a more consistent feel to the rhythm section. Ariel Pink bassist Tim Koh adds some quiet storm-style bass to the airy and melodic ""Chinese High"". Hot Chip frontman Alexis Taylor wanders onto the mic during ""Romance Layers"" to croon over some a new jack-era soul.</p>
<p>And yet this is not a pop record, per se, but the stuff of pop records collected, melted down, and then dribbled Jackson Pollock-style onto a canvas. Singer Lizzi Bougatsos borrows melodies from Indian pop, Brian DeGraw swipes some sub bass from the UK underground, and guitarist Josh Diamond nicks some riffs from North Africa. But Gang Gang aren't just collecting exotic hooks for the sake of bragging rights. The band seems to consciously gravitate toward cultures and genres where music is still overtly tethered to spirituality. Maybe it's because they miss their friends. <i>Eye Contact</i> is a ghost-heavy record. Two songs are dedicated to fallen New York art scene comrades. ""Glass Jar"" pays homage to former band mate Nathan Maddox, who was killed by a lightning bolt in 2002. ""Sacer"" is a shout-out to artist Dash Snow, who perished in 2009, from a drug overdose.</p>
<p><i>Eye Contact</i> dials back the aural fog, at least by Gang Gang standards. It's a tighter and more focused record that pares back the band's habit for noisy embellishment and psychic jewelry to reveal taught rhythms and catchy hooks. ""In the past, I imagined our music being more about closing your eyes and escaping,"" explained DeGraw during a <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/news/41890-take-cover-gang-gang-dance-ieye-contacti/"">recent interview</a>. ""This one felt wide-eyed, as if we were just staring at the listener."" Whether they're comfortable with the outside world is less clear. ""Better call the neurosurgeon,"" sings Bougatsos on album closer ""Thru and Thru"". ""Our dreaming space it is open.""</p></div>"|15403.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15403-eye-contact/|8.5|Aaron Leitko

That band-- formed by bored, obsessive teenagers in mid-1980s Birmingham, England-- sped up death metal into a chaotic, borderline comical blur; their best-known early song is probably still the one-second John Peel favorite ""You Suffer"". The frenzied style that these kids pioneered came to be known as grindcore, and their debut album, <i>Scum</i>, is now regarded as a stone classic in underground metal. But all the original members drifted away; the band remains a touring machine staffed by grizzled vets who regularly crank out more albums of still-potent bloodlettings. You have to wonder how it feels to be a grown man, making your living playing in a band that was started by children, children who no longer have any real connection to what you're doing. And you have to wonder how it feels to be one of those children, moving on to other things in life and watching your childhood creation continuing to pound away.</p>
<p>One of those children is Justin Broadrick, whose post-Napalm Death body of work is a varied and fascinating thing. With Godflesh, he built a brutal slow-thud form of electronic rock, a sound so heavy you couldn't rightly call it metal. He's also made various forms of scraping noise under different names: Techno Animal, Final, Pale Sketcher. And for nearly a decade, he's been the man behind Jesu, where he's done something more startling than anything he did under his other guises: He's created beauty. Jesu's music is a kind of tidal slow-churn take on sad-bastard indie rock, Broadrick burying his muttery one-note vocals under avalanches of guitar fuzz and slathering them in prettily reverbed synth figures.</p>
<p>Jesu have released most of their music on Hydra Head, a label that specializes in contemplative metal, but lately they've been recording for Calo Verde, the label founded by the Red House Painters' Mark Kozelek. Broadrick has cited the Red House Painters as an inspiration, and it's easy to see how those two could form a mutual admiration society. Jesu, especially on the new <i>Ascension</i>, do a pretty incredible job evoking the feeling of depression through music, its melodies buried under so many oceans of impossibly slow sound that you just barely notice they're there. Nothing Broadrick has ever done with Jesu would give you any clue he was ever in Napalm Death, but on his last two albums, a punishing riff or a gnarled roar would occasionally flare up out of nowhere. And there was also a punk-rock directness about the music; more than one critic compared Jesu to Jawbreaker. But on <i>Ascension</i>, Broadrick never allows himself a moment of catharsis or hope; it's music for rocking back and forth in a fetal position.</p>
<p>Nothing remotely rock even happens on the album until 90 seconds in, when a titanic wall of guitar builds up behind the skeletal acoustic figures and muttery Slint-sounding vocals of ""Fools"". ""Birth Day"" has the gasping synths I've come to associate with witch house, as well as all sorts of delicate guitar noodles that would've done Explosions in the Sky proud. A few songs rank as straight-up eight-minute crawls, and the drama comes as the riffs glacially crash into one another, all tragic grandeur. And all throughout, Broadrick sounds like a shattered man, barely ever raising his voice enough that you can clearly make out what he's saying.</p>
<p>This is only Jesu's third album, and their first since 2007's <i>Conqueror</i>, but they've been regularly cranking out EPs since their inception. Those EPs tend to work awfully well; they give you enough of Broadrick's distinctive atmosphere without burying you in that aesthetic. But <i>Ascension</i> is his saddest work, and he lets nothing glimmer through in its hour-long runtime. As an album-length wallow in bad feelings, it's an impressive thing indeed. But I prefer Jesu when their music is about connection rather than isolation. <i>Conqueror</i>, then, still stands as the band's triumphant moment. <i>Ascension</i> is just the long, slow hangover that sets in after.</p></div>"|15375.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15375-ascension/|7.0|Tom Breihan

His commercial appeal and creative verve have dimmed over the years, but he's still an enormously influential figure; it's tough to imagine, say, how Lil Wayne might sound if Cam hadn't paved the way for gangsta rappers who pile up left-turn lyrical absurdities with audible glee. Given all his years in the game, his cult-favorite status, and his impact on the genre, it'd make a whole lot of sense for Cam'ron to do what most older rappers do: call in guest-verse favors and play the mature, reflective elder statesman. But this is, after all, Cam'ron we're talking about. Even at this point, he'd rather kick assholish punchlines: ""Now I'm shaving coke/ On an amazing boat/ 'Fuck you, suck dick'-- I don't know what to say to folks."" The second Cameron Giles figures out what to say to folks, he will cease being the Cam'ron we know.</p>
<p>For the past couple of years, Cam's been pairing up with Vado, a younger Harlem dude with a husky, unstable energy in his voice that recalls past Cam proteges Juelz Santana and Jim Jones. In his own way, Vado's as much fun these days as Cam'ron is, even though his lines aren't nearly as quotable. Vado's got a great array of ad-libs, which he yells constantly, and he attacks every beat like it owes him money. He and Cam make a good pair-- Cam laying back and making fun of you even as he threatens grievous bodily harm, Vado playing the eager and bloodthirsty henchman. Another relative newcomer, the MPC-abusing producer AraabMuzik, handles most of the production, cranking out a succession of hard, simple beats that transform classical string fanfares and 1980s action-movie soundtrack keyboards into utilitarian thuds. Araab's instrumentals can be dense, hectic things, but his beats here just get out of the way and give Cam and Vado room to go to work.</p>
<p>No guests appear on <i>Gunz n' Butta</i>; Cam and Vado are the only rapping voices we hear. And they keep their focus narrow; they're not interested in doing much more than delivering an endless stream of amusingly worded fuck-you-up threats. Lately, Cam's sounded most alive when he's indulging in goofy, oddly gentle relationship talk, as on the great recent single ""Girls Cry"". But ""Girls Cry"", for whatever reason, doesn't appear on the album, and a couple of halfassed love songs buried at the end are the only slight indications that we're dealing with three-dimensional human beings here. Even their minor-hit club tracks, last year's summer jam ""Speakin in Tungs"" and the more recent and still-catchier ""Hey Muma"", only show up on the album after 11 tracks of amoral jokes. But the album works anyway because of Vado's energy and because Cam is still great at clowning people.</p>
<p>Cam doesn't bring the same energy he had on the Diplomats' mid-00s run of mixtapes or on <i>Purple Haze</i>, his 2004 masterpiece, but he's still perfectly capable of putting together a ridiculously strong verse. Even his dumbest lines are a whole lot of fun to repeat: ""You got some gay friends? Me, I got some lesbians/ And you ain't just a actor, you a thespian."" There's just nobody else in rap who does deadpan silliness like that, and Cam makes it sound like the easiest thing in the world. There's nothing even the slightest bit innovative about <i>Gunz n' Butta</i>, but it does give us Cam, Vado, and Araab, three guys with great chemistry, doing what they do. It's a one-dimensional affair, but that one dimension is pretty awesome.</p></div>"|15391.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15391-gunz-n-butta/|7.6|Tom Breihan

But four albums in, proudly Francophone Montrealers Malajube are still happy to get lost in translation, even with two Polaris Music Prize nominations and several Stateside tours under their belts. That said, in Malajube's case, the language barrier is a porous one-- for one, their songs often come with remedial titles that provide easily discernible emotional cues (e.g.: ""La Blizzard"", ""Ibuprofène""), and, much like the Super Furries before them, the band has exhibited a knack for fusing psychedelia, prog- and classic-rock, disco, and new wave into exuberant, easily grasped big-tent indie pop.</p>
<p>Neither as manic as 2006 breakthrough <i>Trompe L'Oeil</i> nor as knotty as 2009's appropriately titled <i>Labyrinthes</i>, <i>La Caverne</i> sees Malajube settle into a lush, soft-rockin' groove that, true to their all-French songwriting policy, suggests the band is completely content playing in its comfort zone; tellingly, the album was recorded in a secluded, custom-built, geodesic-dome house located deep in the Laurentians. (In fact, Malajube sound so blissfully self-contained here, it's not unreasonable to think they're completely oblivious to how much the <i>La Caverne</i>'s blue-vector cover graphics resemble those of Daft Punk's <i>Tron</i> soundtrack.) The relatively stress-free recording environment naturally manifests itself in the performances: whether it's smooth yacht-rockin' disco (""Synesthésie"") or upbeat, glockenspieled pop (""Radiologie""), singer Julien Mineau's voice rarely wavers from a daydreamy sigh, indicating he has little desire to challenge fellow countrymen Win Butler or Kevin Drew in the crowd-rousing, master-of-ceremonies department.</p>
<p>Clocking in at 10 tracks and a mere 32 minutes, <i>La Caverne</i> can breeze by without your realizing it, which is as much a comment on the songs' consistently pleasing, shimmering surfaces as their tendency to come and go without much incident; while nocturnally tinted songs like ""Sangsues"" and ""Le Stridor"" hint at a creeping tension, the album is decidedly lacking in a curtain-raising dramatic flourish like <i>Labyrinthes</i>' ""Ursuline"", or an emotional centerpiece à la <i>Trompe</i>'s epic star-gazing ballad ""Étienne D'août"". Perhaps <i>La Caverne</i>'s streamlined simplicity is an inevitable retreat from <i>Labyrinthes</i>' structural complexities, and with songs as immediately engaging as the power-pop rush of ""Cro-Magnon"" or the gorgeously tranquil ""Mon Oeil"", it's hard to fault that approach. But a big part of Malajube's initial appeal was how willing they were to upset their joyous melodies with shocks of screaming or bizarro electronic intrusions. Malajube's admirable dedication to singing in their native tongue already suggests a certain lack of compromise in making themselves more accessible to the masses; with <i>La Caverne</i>, you just wish that same sense of daring was reflected a little more in the music.</p></div>"|15389.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15389-la-caverne/|7.0|Stuart Berman

With the Wave Pictures, it's a bit more mundane. They're just trying to get over here: <i>If You Leave It Alone </i>and <i>Instant Coffee Baby </i>were respectively their seventh and eighth LPs, and thanks to a distribution deal with Moshi Moshi, in 2010 they were packaged as a double album to become their first commercially available release in the U.S.</p>
<p>But mundanity is fitting for the Wave Pictures, since the characters in Dave Tattersall's verbose but musically unadorned short stories do very mundane things: spend days at the seaside, scoop ice cream, get involved in go-nowhere relationships. If this recalls Art Brut or the Streets, you're not far off, since the Wave Pictures are most definitely a lyrics-first act and a distinctly British one. That's usually a tough sell to begin with, but the problem with <i>Beer in the Breakers </i>isn't one of culture or slang so much as a narrator who is almost wholly forgettable-- their stories are boring.</p>
<p>The key distinction is that these songs are more often being <i>told </i>to you as opposed to <i>shared</i>, even if the first lyric (""I swam out to greet you"") suggests a conversation happening with the listener. Tattersall fires off some nice images and bon mots-- ""Who are you to tell me that I look depressed/ You wouldn't even know if I'm at my best"" is particularly pithy-- but they merely sit in place hoping to be admired rather than meeting the listener halfway.</p>
<p>Tattersall's British wit may be appropriately dry, but the Wave Pictures' arrangements are basically deserted, little more than sprightly Stratocaster chords and a polite rhythm section that could easily hold residency at a local coffee shop. ""Little Surprise"" at least lives up to its name with a brisk quasi-Afro-pop riff, and elsewhere the more upbeat numbers recall the ultra-clean guitar work of Orange Juice. But anytime the tempo slows, they lapse into a tedium that becomes irritating-- particularly on the title track, where the vast pockets of space in the production almost allow you to hear the Wave Pictures losing interest in real time.</p>
<p>Unless the Mars Volta have a new album in the works, I'm not sure if I'll hear a record with more guitar solos this year (credit ""Blue Harbour"" for at least having a <i>bass </i>solo). And they appear at nearly the same point at every track, played with a technical precision very rare in indie circles, but after the initial surprise wears off, you can mostly imagine Tattersall pulling off those slow bends and sustained vibrato while rocking his best G.E. Smith face. Rather than anticipating a crescendo or introducing an intriguing melodic turn, they simply kill time-- the most mundane activity of them all.</p></div>"|15373.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15373-beer-in-the-breakers/|5.1|Ian Cohen

The duo, which got some attention hosting the popular (and now-dormant) Wildness party series at the L.A. club Silver Platter, incorporates most every strain of domestic and global music into its beats-- from Chicago juke and footwork to UK bass, mambo, reggaeton, and cumbia. But they also celebrate the familiar: For all the exotic sounds in an Nguzunguzu track, there are usually elements of chart hip-hop and R&amp;B offsetting them.</p>
<p>Nguzunguzu have two EPs to their name-- <i>Mirage</i> and a self-titled one, both from 2010-- but the best introduction to their sound is <i>The Perfect Lullaby</i>, an album-length mixtape made for the online art magazine DIS. (It's available for a free download <a href=""http://dismagazine.com/disco/mixes/14817/nguzunguzu-the-perfect-lullaby/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.) On this, Pineda and Maroof (it's worth mentioning that the latter recently served as M.I.A.'s tour DJ) build a bouncy, dreamy mix that takes specific inspiration from the Angolan dance genres of Kizomba and Zouk. These styles are generally slow and seductive and have a grimy, percussive undercurrent, and Nguzunguzu match that with the similarly sultry vocals of artists like Brandy and The-Dream. The combination is pretty ingenious.</p>
<p>A big part of the reason the mix works so well is simple execution-- Nguzunguzu blend these far-flung sounds together in a way that just feels natural. They often leave source material intact (vocals are rarely tweaked or mutated, as they are in some recent indie-leaning R&amp;B), so it's less about intricate remixing than careful beat matching. For example, early in the set (it's not divided into individual tracks), they put R. Kelly's verse from Ja Rule's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IakclfCvTiA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wonderful""</a> over a Zouk instrumental by DJ P&amp;P Productions that flips the context of the source but maintains something essential about it, too. The same goes for Amerie's classic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JSXr_9SXEM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""1 Thing""</a>, set here to a grimy beat by France's DJ Lo, placing the original's high-energy clamor on a humid slow boil.</p>
<p>In a recent <a href=""http://wfmu.org/playlists/shows/39557"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with DJ /rupture on his WFMU show, Mudd Up!, Maroof talked about a Nguzunguzu track combining a Wiley instrumental with the Nicki Minaj remix of Drake's ""Best I Ever Had"", saying, ""She kind of raps like a grime MC on it... I want her to be a grime MC, so I just kind of put the two together."" A simple statement, but it gets at what the group does so well-- sort of a wide-eyed, creative reshuffling of <i>au courant</i> music. So even with the R&amp;B bent of this mix, the group seems more in line with folks like DJ /rupture and even M.I.A. than the crop of urban-pop revisionists that has sprung up recently.

Oh, but you really gotta pay attention to the lyrics. And their best songs are the slow ones. Their facepaint, percussion, and piano-pounding portray them as wild men, but Honus Honus' junkyard-dog howl is the projection of an old soul. This duality is more pronounced than ever on their fourth LP, <i>Life Fantastic. </i>On one end, it's by far their most tasteful and well-produced record to date. But it contains the darkest, most frightening lyrics Honus has written-- which is really saying something.</p>
<p>It makes sense that the band brought in Saddle Creek house producer Mike Mogis, not just for his mastery of reining in orchestral bric-a-brac but also for his experience with the most caustic emotional bloodletting. But not even early Bright Eyes can hold a candle to the absolutely scorching self-immolation of <i>Life Fantastic</i>. Leadoff ""Knuckle Down"" casts Honus as an all-too-willing supplicant in an emotionally and sexually draining relationship. But at least someone's getting their rocks off there-- more typical is the atomic ""Dark Arts"", which details an accident Honus suffered before the <i>Life Fantastic </i>sessions.</p>
<p>The autobiographical details are a bit stifling at times, but Honus' other lyrical subjects are no better off: Within the subtly hooky vocals of the title track, children find a corpse at a picnic and are informed by their parents that ""the world is dying."" If there's a better marimba-led tango about a killer who turns his victims into household items (""The fireman is an ashtray/ The DJ spins as fan blades""), I haven't heard it. And in the tradition of OutKast's ""Toilet Tisha"", don't let a silly title (""Spooky Jookie"") distract you from a harrowing and grotesque account of a life slipping away to drugs (""She broke her teeth/ On an unsheathed piece of hard-tasting candy"").</p>
<p>While Honus continues to prove himself one of rock's best working lyricists, <i>Life Fantastic</i> contains as many musically compelling moments as <i>Rabbit Habits </i>and <i>Six Demon Bag</i>. They've dialed down the wacky factor-- not as many cartoon voices, no kazoos-- though it's not a simple matter of having a ""real producer"" for the first time. Clearly, Mogis cleans them up nicely, importing lovely string sections for the title track and ""Oh, La Brea"". But for every song such as ""Knuckle Down"" that packs a sturdy, forceful melody, others struggle to fit the contours of Honus' syntax. Pay too much attention to the words and the songs can bleed into each other, or recall older Man Man material.</p>
<p>That's not a sin, considering Man Man have created a niche that's wholly theirs. It's natural for them to embrace this established identiy, most clearly expressed on closer ""Oh, La Brea"". Settling in Los Angeles after a few itinerant years, Honus finds himself disenfranchised by the west side (""Sepulveda and Pico, what the hell do they know about me?"") as well as the artsier east side. He finds comfort in the thoroughfare sharing its name with a tar pit-- fitting for a pitch-black record that reveals as many skeletons as you're willing to dig for.</p></div>"|15383.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15383-life-fantastic/|7.4|Ian Cohen

In a decade-long career, he's played a staggering number of roles: Serving as foot soldier in Master P's fading No Limit empire, standing in Lil Wayne's shadow during that man's historic mid-00s run, striking out on his own and building himself to cult-favorite status on a series of weed-and-sneaker-addled solo mixtapes, inhabiting Ski Beatz' sumptuous psychedelic-soul production on last year's two great <i>Pilot Talk</i> albums. And now that he's established himself as one of the stars of an ascendant Internet-friendly stoner-rap scene, he's giving himself a new challenge, pairing up with the producer Alchemist for the online giveaway <i>Covert Coup</i>.</p>
<p>Alchemist has had a tumultuous career of his own. He's a Beverly Hills native who came to prominence crafting Tunnel anthems for New York roughnecks like Mobb Deep and Jadakiss. These days, he specializes in a broken, warped form of rap production-- classic New York boom-bap refracted through prisms, the loose-and-shaggy Stones Throw cratedigger style turned ominous and bloodthirsty. His tracks for <i>Covert Coup</i> aren't far removed from the stuff he did on <i>Gutter Water</i>, an overlooked 2010 album that found him teaming with the West Coast underground stalwart Oh No, the two of them bouncing their queasiest, most unsettled head-nodders off of each other. On <i>Covert Coup</i>, his decayed guitar loops and creeping drum breaks remind me of the shattered post-apocalyptic New York that Snake Plissken had to escape. It's a different kind of weed-rap, one Curren$y hasn't really tried to do. And yet he slip-slides through it with the charming, effortless ease that's become his trademark. Nothing fazes this guy.</p>
<p>Curren$y's been calling <i>Covert Coup</i> an EP, but it's 10 tracks in 28 minutes, longer than plenty of punk and indie full-lengths I own. The mixtape follows what I guess you'd call the <i>Madvillainy </i>model-- 90-second stretches of dense lyricism,
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
usually without a chorus-- before the rapper fades out and the woozy, evocative track takes over. Curren$y's verses aren't punchline marathons; they're stoned reveries, and it can be riveting to hear him depict certain situations with loose, unhurried narrative precision: ""Let the little homey kick it in the auto shop with us/ Long as he can make store runs and keep his mouth shut/ Same way I came up.""</p>
<p>As a rapper, Curren$y's greatest asset is his delivery, the way his pinched, nasal Louisiana drawl slithers its way through the track. But he's also great at coming up with sharp, unexpected ways to address standard rap topics. On his weed-smoking capacity: ""The toxic air that I'm breathing would leave a average man weakened."" On his own charisma: ""If you looking for that nigga, I is him/ All eyes in this direction/ A burden and a blessing."" On his home life: ""White carpets in my <i>Scarface</i> house/ No undergarments on my <i>Scarface</i> spouse."" On how high he is right this second: ""Playa all Himalaya-ish."" His lyrics are full of slick little tricks like these, tiny turns of phrase that sneak up on you after multiple listens but which dazzle in their economy when you parse them out.</p>
<p>A few well-selected guests turn up on <i>Covert Coup</i>, and all of them make strong foils for Curren$y's conversational calm. Freddie Gibbs' focused on-fire double-time on ""Scottie Pippen"" stands in stark contrast to Curren$y's style, and the two extremes work well together. Alc's just-out-of-prison blood brother Prodigy plays a tough, raspy uncle figure, showing a sense of hardhead style that emerges too rarely on P's own recent online offering, <i>The Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson EP</i>. Curren$y's puff-buddy Smoke DZA breezes right through ""Life Instructions"". And fellow New Orleans vet Fiend has a great moment on ""Blood Sweat and Gears"", letting off a couple of lines in a bluesy moan-sing before snapping into an excellent grown-man verse. These guest spots do what they're supposed to do. They don't overwhelm Curren$y or clash with his style; they just bring some new dimensions out of his songs. They're there for chemistry reasons, not name value, and they work great.</p>
<p>Curren$y let <i>Covert Coup</i> out into the world on 4/20, a fun but unnecessary attention-grabbing stunt. There's plenty of zoned-out atmosphere on the tape, but it's a strong, focused, unified piece of work, not just a lava-lamp soundtrack. It stands on its own.</p></div>"|15385.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15385-covert-coup/|7.9|Tom Breihan

That's not to disparage her current collection of collaborators, which includes former Shudder to Think guitarist Nathan Larson and  troubador Joseph Arthur, as well as producer Bryce Goggin, the  go-to guy for most of Matador Records' mid-90s output. You still get the sense she's trying to make the type of mature and  sophisticated pop music that can stand comfortably with these and  other like-minded contemporaries. Unfortunately, while she aims for such critically  acclaimed heights, her shots often land in a  middle-of-the-road, adult-contemporary wasteland.</p>
<p>On a purely musical level, <i>The Deep Field</i> handles its business in a professional manner.  The songs can settle into a uninspired groovy shuffle at times, ""The Magic"" being the key offender. And there are elements that tend to over-announce their presence at the cost of drowning out everything else-- usually it's the faux-funky organ, but the background singers making like human didgeridoos on ""Human Condition"" deserve a special mention.  Still, it's hard to fully disregard a songwriter who can conjure up the haunting Talk Talk-like ambiance of ""Flash"", or gracefully send off ""The Action Man"" on a bed of strings, woodwinds, and percussion.  It's when Wasser puts her voice front and center that <i>The Deep Field</i> collapses in on itself.</p>
<p>Wasser trades in all sorts of vagaries and generalizations, taking an entire track to convey an idea that could be succinctly expressed in a single verse. If Wasser were a stronger vocalist, she might be able to get by with this sort of shoddy writing; put these songs in Adele's golden throat, and they'd probably be chart-toppers.  Wasser's voice is a decidely more subtle instrument.  It has character, but its wispy, semi-sultry charm isn't robust enough to sell an outright dog like ""Chemmie"", a shameless slow jam that requires the bombastic pipes of Larson's former bandmate, Craig Wedren, to make it even remotely palatable. It's sadly appropriate that this misfire of a song-- about a couple with undeniable chemistry-- epitomizes an album that comes off as hopelessly inert.</p></div>"|15387.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15387-the-deep-field/|4.5|David Raposa

They like finely textured guitars and electronics, quasi-classical embellishments, miniature clockwork percussion, and windy vocals placed high in the mix. <i>Flora </i>definitely has that Fredrik feel, which is like a Scandinavian <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a>, or the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3067-the-notwist/"">Notwist</a> at their duskiest. But while <i>Trilogi </i>was rooted in folk and trip-hop, <i>Flora </i>seems to take more cues from dance music, in its distant post-rock way. The motif at the beginning of ""<a href=""http://musicforperfectpeople.com/2011/03/02/download-fredrik-rites-of-spring/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rites of Spring</a>"" passes within spitting distance of Culture Beat's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvgUdrzGNys"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mr. Vain</a>"", and you'll hear a greater emphasis on pittering snares, hand percussion, and arpeggiated synths than before. Where <i>Trilogi </i>was more focused on rococo leaps and hesitations, <i>Flora </i>draws out a stiffened pulse.</p>
<p>The record opens with the kind of sonic foliage that was allowed to flourish more freely on <i>Trilogi</i>: ""Ylva"", where an otherworldly voice lifts out of chimes. But the first proper song, ""Vattenfront"", takes a crashing turn. Waves of horns course through a tight circuit of bass and snippy percussion, establishing a feint-and-attack pattern that carries on into the Knife-like ""Chrome Cavities"" and several other songs. This new approach is kind of a trade-off. The downside is that the subtleties feel flatted by all the smoke and thunder; the upside is that some adrenaline pumps into Fredrik's even-tempered sound. But a couple of the most unequivocally appealing songs clear out more space around the singing. On ""Inventress of Ill (and Everything)"", the kind of squeal that steamrolls some songs is relegated to a more helpful role, coloring a quiet melody in
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
the background. There's some room to breathe and sink into this pulse Fredrik are exploring. You want to lean in, rather than back.</p>
<p>For all of its good qualities, it's hard to pinpoint what makes <i>Flora </i>a little less satisfying than <i>Trilogi </i>overall. I think it has to do with a certain softness that is diminished in favor of a chest-beating tone. Certainly, there are a few mechanical issues: Some songs that aim to trance out just wind up feeling repetitive, and more than once, I found myself wishing that whoever was banging on metal stuff so relentlessly would just cut it out. (""The North Greatern"" combines both of these flaws.) But the real difference is that <i>Trilogi </i>earned and offset its more blustery moments with haunting respites like ""Milo"". While <i>Flora </i>exceeds <i>Trilogi </i>in pageantry, it never feels as effortless or humble as that little tune did-- the two qualities that distinguish Fredrik's best work from haughty post-rock boilerplate.</p></div>"|15388.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15388-flora/|6.5|Brian Howe

During those years, the Beastie Boys didn't sell the most records or grace the most magazine covers, but they brilliantly articulated how a constellation of obsessions-- early hip-hop, hardcore, trash culture, 70s TV, vintage sneakers, skateboarding, vinyl records-- could be pulled together into not just a coherent aesthetic but a way of life.</p>
<p>Looking at their arc from a purely musical perspective, you could divide their career in half at the midpoint of that decade-- at some point between 1994's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13319-ill-communication-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ill Communication</i></a> and 1998's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13527-hello-nasty-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hello Nasty</i></a>. Their first four full-lengths came in less than eight years, and during this stretch, they were hungry and on the move, restlessly searching for new avenues of music expression. They're just now getting to their third proper album (fourth, if you want to count 2007's instrumental LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10374-the-mix-up/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Mix-Up</i></a>) in the 17 years since. The Boys became men, and now they're gliding respectably into middle age, living honorable lives and playing music only if and when they feel like it. (This album was originally supposed to come out in 2009, but MCA has been battling cancer and the re-jiggered version was labeled <i>Part Two</i>.) They broke their ground, and now they have nothing to prove and no pop scene to become part of. Which means that they can focus on being the Beastie Boys, and let the fans decide if they want to engage with them on that level.</p>
<p>In this case, being the Beastie Boys means returning to the thicker, heavier sound they ushered in with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12923-check-your-head-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Check Your Head</i></a> and <i>Ill Communication</i>. <i>Hot Sauce Committee</i> mixes live instrumentation and samples into the kind of soupy production first unleashed on the world with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpsvBvwRuf0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Pass the Mic""</a> and furthered with songs like ""So What'cha Want"" and ""Sure Shot"". It's a very different feel from 2004's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/608-to-the-5-boroughs/"" target=""_blank""><i>To the 5 Boroughs</i></a>, their post-9/11 love letter to New York that found them more or less stripping down and letting simpler beats and straight-ahead vocals do the talking. These songs are dense with sound effects and heavy on the bottom end, and the vocals are processed with a mixture of distortion and EQ that obscures the details of their rapping and the content of their lyrics but also gives the music a bit of snarl. They're good at this sound.</p>
<p>The song titles suggest that the Beastie Boys feel comfort in their position, addressing culture that was already retro in 1986 (""Lee Majors Come Again""-- he was the Six Million Dollar Man, kids), paying tribute to the music of their youth (""Nonstop Disco Powerpack""), and offering a bit of inspirational uplift (""Long Burn the Fire""). These and other tracks reference earlier work in ways even more direct. ""Lee Majors"" is the latest in the line of ""Remember, we used to be a hardcore band"" songs that stretches back to their 1992 cover of Sly Stone's ""Time for Livin'"". ""Long Burn the Fire"" has vocals from all three, but starts off feeling like a ""state of MCA"" dispatch in the vein of ""Stand Together"" or ""A Year and a Day"", this time delivered with a touch of weariness. Both ""Fire"" and ""Say It"" have an overloaded end-of-bar sound effect that brings to mind ""Pass the Mic"", <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdJ5e70Q8mw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Gratitude""</a>, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5rRZdiu1UE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sabotage""</a>. And ""Nonstop"" once again has rhymes about macaroni and cheese and keeping on until the break of dawn.</p>
<p>Other echoes from earlier songs abound, but you don't come to the Beastie Boys for something new, which is perfectly fine, even a little admirable. Beginning with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12671-pauls-boutique/"" target=""_blank""><i>Paul's Boutique</i></a>, part of their appeal has been that they've built a little clubhouse in their G-Son studio and invited everyone inside. They've gone off on their own trip, returning to the same pop culture obsessions and building their own context rather than integrating into the musical world around them.</p>
<p>On two songs here, they do in fact invite in notable guests. First is ""Too Many Rappers"", which debuted online in 2009 and finds Nas trading rhymes with his hometown pals. While it doesn't come close to the silly and stoned riffing of the 1994 Q-Tip feature ""Get It Together"", it's going for something entirely different-- a spiky aggro feel that finds their fellow New Yorker sounding a bit distant and indistinct. ""Don't Play No Game That I Can't Win"" features Santigold on the hook of a track with a reggae lilt, and the pairing feels natural and obvious-- you could argue that the Beastie Boys' polyglot approach in the 90s helped clear the way for her style, which mixes an ear for the sound of other cultures with a touch of Lower East Side artiness.</p>
<p>Taken together, these 16 songs, which seem to touch on just about everything the Beastie Boys have said and done, may not add up to something amazing, but they do the job. And listening to <i>Hot Sauce Committee</i>, it's hard not to reflect on how long the Beastie Boys have been together and how, unusually, their musical partnership still seems grounded in friendship rather than just business. There's still something inspiring in the <i>idea</i> of the Beastie Boys that transcends any single release. So while this may not be a great album or even a top-tier Beastie Boys album-- I'd place it somewhere between <i>Hello Nasty</i> and the inferior <i>5 Boroughs</i>, neither of which can touch those first four-- anyone who cares about these guys will be glad it exists.</p></div>"|15398.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15398-hot-sauce-committee-part-two/|7.0|Mark Richardson

The past continues to be the focus in Cat's Eyes, Badwan's collaborative project with Canadian opera singer and multi-instrumentalist Rachel Zeffira. The pair create gauzy reminiscences of 1950s and 60s pop, while their videos and visual design resemble the flickering glow of a damaged, ancient TV set. Even Cat's Eyes' first show took place in a particularly old-world venue: St. Peter's Basilica, in Vatican City.</p>
<p>Leading up to the duo's self-titled debut LP, Badwan cited Joe Meek, Phil Spector, and the film <i>Dirty Dancing</i> as sources of inspiration; there are merely strains of those influences throughout <i>Cat's Eyes</i>. Instead, Badwan and Zeffira have created an enjoyably sinister, richly atmospheric backdrop for their soft-focus pop fragments. The influence of Portishead's Geoff Barrow producing <i>Primary Colours</i> continues to bear fruit, as the intense claustrophobia that marked Portishead's 2008 comeback <i>Third</i> similarly colors these proceedings. The death-march horns in ""Bandit"" suggest that the badly behaved lover in question is more of a murderer than a philanderer; when the infamous opening rhythm to the Ronettes' ""Be My Baby"" finally appears in the kiss-off ""Not a Friend"", it sounds not like a heartbeat, but a pair of feet, trying to get the hell out of town.</p>
<p>Zeffira sounds like she's already gone, though: She maintains her distance throughout <i>Cat's Eyes.</i> Any hint of her operatic training has been wiped clean and replaced with a delivery that rarely breaks past a coolly delivered sing-chant. Initially, the choice <i>not</i> to exercise what's a fairly unique ability comes off as a bit strange; you'd think that she would want to see how at least one of these songs would sound in her full-throated soprano. As it turns out, though, Zeffira's vocal stylistic departure is a solid fit, emphasizing the damaged loneliness captured on the record. She floats over these songs, dropping quiet bombs on ""Best Person I Know"" and adding weariness to the brassy proclamations of ""Over You"". At times, her voice is reminiscent of late Broadcast member Trish Keenan in vocal tone and enunciation, adding an occasionally eerie feel to <i>Cat's Eyes.</i></p>
<p>Consequently, when Badwan's own deep-toned voice enters to duet with Zeffira, it's something of an intrusion; unhelpfully, during the torrential dirge ""Sooner or Later"", he takes his only solo turn on the album, and the droning mess sticks out like a fist of sore thumbs. Badwan and Zeffira are credited with writing, orchestrating, and arranging the record on their own, and despite all the fluttery horns and Disney strings it wears like Christmas bells, the result is tight in form and execution. The two non-Cat's Eyes cuts from the <i>Broken Glass</i> teaser EP released earlier this year, the punky ""Sunshine Girls"" and ""Love You Anyway"", would have no place on this album, revealing a talent for self-editing that makes a miserable, moaning momentum-killer like ""Sooner or Later"" feel wholly extraneous. Otherwise, <i>Cat's Eyes</i> is the rare side project effort that feels as (if not more) fully realized than the band from which it borrows members.</p></div>"|15397.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15397-cats-eyes/|7.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

Chapman, for instance, suggested Mick Ronson for the electric guitar parts on his second album, 1970's <i>Fully Qualified Survivor</i>, a move that put the local gardener in touch with a performer named David Bowie. Elton John tried to recruit Chapman to be his acoustic guitarist (and, like Led Zeppelin, arguably borrowed some of Chapman's music for his own), and he was part of the cadre of songwriters like Syd Barrett and Shirley Collins who made Harvest Records such an important early outlet for wild, weird records. Chapman toured and befriended John Fahey and Jack Rose, recently finished work on LPs for Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace!, and has published a novel. It's possible to make Chapman sound like an incredible musician without examining his music at all.</p>
<p>But Chapman should be known for more than the myths around him, and thanks to the diligent excavations of two excellent American labels, he might soon be: In late February, Light in the Attic Records released <i>Fully Qualified Survivor</i>, Chapman's second LP for Harvest and the home of his most famous tune, the perfectly heartsick ""Postcards of Scarborough"". A terrifically unpredictable album, <i>Survivor</i>, even four decades later, feels beyond any genre tag. He proves he's a world-class songwriter, portraying lovesick loneliness during the gorgeous ""Kodak Ghosts"" with the same detail-driven despair of Bill Callahan and John Darnielle. He's an articulate, spirited guitarist, too, treating each of the notes on the brief instrumental ""Fishbeard Sunset"" with a Fahey-like care and commitment. ""Aviator"" is a 10-minute lament that never feels like an unfocused ramble. Its forlorn violin and cello (arranged by Elton John-collaborator-to-be Paul Buckmaster) push against the guitars in sinister streaks, Chapman offering his Dylan-sized invective through daring Yorkshire slurs. <i>Fully Qualified Survivor</i> is a boldly open-ended record, then, the kind that makes the freak-folk of the last decade seem less freaky and more like a point along an old continuum.</p>

Chapman, for instance, suggested Mick Ronson for the electric guitar parts on his second album, 1970's <i>Fully Qualified Survivor</i>, a move that put the local gardener in touch with a performer named David Bowie. Elton John tried to recruit Chapman to be his acoustic guitarist (and, like Led Zeppelin, arguably borrowed some of Chapman's music for his own), and he was part of the cadre of songwriters like Syd Barrett and Shirley Collins who made Harvest Records such an important early outlet for wild, weird records. Chapman toured and befriended John Fahey and Jack Rose, recently finished work on LPs for Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace!, and has published a novel. It's possible to make Chapman sound like an incredible musician without examining his music at all.</p>
<p>But Chapman should be known for more than the myths around him, and thanks to the diligent excavations of two excellent American labels, he might soon be: In late February, Light in the Attic Records released <i>Fully Qualified Survivor</i>, Chapman's second LP for Harvest and the home of his most famous tune, the perfectly heartsick ""Postcards of Scarborough"". A terrifically unpredictable album, <i>Survivor</i>, even four decades later, feels beyond any genre tag. He proves he's a world-class songwriter, portraying lovesick loneliness during the gorgeous ""Kodak Ghosts"" with the same detail-driven despair of Bill Callahan and John Darnielle. He's an articulate, spirited guitarist, too, treating each of the notes on the brief instrumental ""Fishbeard Sunset"" with a Fahey-like care and commitment. ""Aviator"" is a 10-minute lament that never feels like an unfocused ramble. Its forlorn violin and cello (arranged by Elton John-collaborator-to-be Paul Buckmaster) push against the guitars in sinister streaks, Chapman offering his Dylan-sized invective through daring Yorkshire slurs. <i>Fully Qualified Survivor</i> is a boldly open-ended record, then, the kind that makes the freak-folk of the last decade seem less freaky and more like a point along an old continuum.</p>

They have not, to my knowledge, released a hip-hop track; the klezmer influence is negligible. Beyond that, though, their shapeshifting post-rock seems capable of swallowing genres whole. And <i>Deep Politics</i>, their latest, is among their richest, most expansive offerings to date.</p>
<p>From stoner sludge to swirling desert rock to meditative mood music, Grails run an impressively wide gamut on <i>Deep Politics</i>. Less heavy and histrionic than 2008's grisly <i>Doomsdayer's Holiday</i>, <i>Deep Politics</i> has a rugged but decidedly habitable feel, craggy but markedly earthbound. Though the record's cohesion in the midst of its ever-changing sound is plenty impressive, each constituent part, too, is thrilling. So much post-rock leaves the listener waiting around for the good bit to kick in; Grails' constantly changing sound makes every moment arresting, not simply the big crescendos. For all its sparseness and delicacy, nearly every moment on <i>Deep Politics</i> is suffused with a sort of looming dread. And when it hits, it hits hard.</p>
<p>You can take your pick on <i>Deep Politics</i>' most stunning segment; the gnarled tangle of guitar and strings on opener ""Future Primitive"", the towering symphonic blast of ""All the Colors of the Dark"", the punishing back half of ""I Led Three Lives"". The many quiet moments prove just as rich and striking, suffusing the disc with rays of light to help offset the wide swaths of darkness. They push sounds nimbly in and out of the mix without ever risking overload, and while there's plenty of virtuosity bubbling under the surface-- particularly on the trickily fingerpicked closer ""Deep Snow""-- there's little flash to be found, all instruments joined in service of the overall picture. From swirling Eastern-tinged psych to ruddy widescreen metal to lilting modern classical-inflected strings, the dynamics are constantly in motion, but everything slots together just so.</p>
<p>The flute-led ""Corridors of Power"" shoots for twilight peyote ceremony but winds up in a suburban yoga studio; it's salvaged a bit by its snaky guitar backdrop, but it's the moment on <i>Deep Politics</i> that misses its mark. Just the same, though, it's as easy to imagine the smoky backlight poster vibe of the mildly funky ""Daughters of Bilitis"" or one of their sidetrips into heavier realms turning some other listener away. That's the risk you take when you take on so much music in the course of three-quarters of an hour, I suppose. But while their pan-genre noise is certainly ambitious, the quietly virtuosic Grails only occasionally overreach. And even as they fold more sounds into the mixture, they find a place for nearly all of them. All encompassing and utterly engrossing, <i>Deep Politics</i> proves yet another stirring triumph from one of rock's great unsung ensembles.</p></div>"|15390.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15390-deep-politics/|7.9|Paul Thompson

For someone entering his fourth decade of making underground music, the singer found real-life pressures had forced him to put his main band on the back burner. The interview reveals that his natural talent as an arranger allowed him to keep working in music in some capacity, but those long stretches between High Llamas albums aren't going to be getting shorter any time soon. The last time he released a full-length recording with the band was with the 2007 release <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9887-can-cladders/"">Can Cladders</a></i>, which worked chirpy soul and R&amp;B influences into the core High Llamas template. O'Hagan spends a decent amount of time talking about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4651-brian-wilson/"">Brian Wilson</a> during that podcast, and he seems to be at peace with the fact that the band's base sound is essentially a refraction of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"">Beach Boys</a> dreaminess circa ""Cabinessence"".</p>
<p>On <i>Talahomi Way</i> he's subtly twisted the High Llamas' aesthetic once again. It again feels like O'Hagan has rifled through his record collection and immersed their sound in its esoteric element. It's led to an uneven career, with the band often sounding like they're slotting parts of a puzzle together (<a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Martin+Denny"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Martin Denny</a>-style exotica, 90s <a href=""http://warp.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp</a>-esque electronica, etc.) but struggling to form a solid identity of their own beyond those basic ingredients. Here, they've erred toward the tender <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j3O4X0CkWw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bach Ze""</a>-style side of their sound for the duration of a short record that again highlights their strengths and weaknesses. It's incredibly tasteful and somewhat filmic at times, with the brief bursts of strings on tracks like ""Woven and Rolled"" and
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
the lush harp of ""To the Abbey"" resembling the soundtrack to a sumptuous Technicolor melodrama. ""Fly Baby, Fly"" sounds directly extracted from 70s AM radio.</p>
<p>O'Hagan calls this a spring album, and with good reason. The songs have a supple weightlessness to them. It feels like the first crack of the sun's rays after months of grey skies. Additionally, one of the weakest components of the High Llamas' sound-- O'Hagan's wholegrain vocals-- is significantly dampened by some well-placed multi-part harmonies and several instrumental tracks. At times it lapses into unwelcome pastiche; the rustic harmonica on ""A Rock in May"" could be ripped from the soundtrack to the long-running CBS snoozefest ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waltons"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Waltons</a>"". The standout track, the opening ""Berry Adams"", seems to have been politely set at the start of the running order to get it out of the way in case it actually grabs someone's attention. In it, O'Hagan weaves a tale of a workingman down on his luck and with crushed dreams in mind, while a string arrangement that will sound instantly familiar to anyone who has followed his career blooms up around him.</p>
<p>From there it's a pleasant amble through the rest of the record, which carries a dainty air partly shaped by the exclusion of intrusive drum patterns on most of the songs. The preponderance of long instrumental passages suggests O'Hagan is acutely aware of both his shortcomings as a songwriter and his strengths as an arranger. ""Wander, Jack Wander"" is set in motion by some delightfully parping trumpets and beautifully filmy strings, while ""Angel Connector"" is a slight return to his <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Turn+On"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Turn On</a>-style attraction to analog circuitry. Those two tracks, both entirely instrumental, find a little more space to breathe than the vocal-heavy passages elsewhere on <i>Talahomi Way</i>. Perhaps with a stronger singer and lyricist this band may have gained more momentum throughout its career, but it's unlikely that's what O'Hagan has ever had in mind. He seems perfectly content to let these small-wonder songs shuffle out unobtrusively into the world, and it's come to feel like a comforting spot to return to every couple of years or so.</p></div>"|15354.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15354-talahomi-way/|6.8|Nick Neyland

This suggests a thematic connection between these records, or at least some kind of grand plan. If this unorthodox way of announcing future projects is indeed a meaningful thing, it may also be significant that, whereas <i>Skeletal Lamping</i> and <i>False Priest</i> arrived as full-length works complete with their own distinct quirks and visual iconography, <i>thecontrollersphere</i> is a set of leftovers from the <i>False Priest </i>sessions. Though its tone is very different from <i>False Priest</i>, the deck-clearing nature of this EP hints that Barnes may be eager to complete this arc and move on to something else.</p>
<p>""Black Lion Massacre"", the EP's opening track, is the best indication of Barnes' creative restlessness. It's a five-minute noise rock dirge; deliberately unpleasant and violent in its attack. Prior to the release of <i>False Priest</i>, Barnes had mentioned in some interviews that he had wanted to make music that was ugly and visceral; this song is almost certainly the product of this impulse. As much as it is different from the band's established psychedelic funk style, its monologue about a horrific sexual ritual is firmly rooted in the erudite freakiness of Barnes' last few records. ""Black Lion Massacre"" also foregrounds a darkness and rage that was buried just beneath the surface of the <i>False Priest</i> material. It sounds like an exhausting catharsis.</p>
<p>The remainder of <i>thecontrollersphere</i> hews closer to the sound of <i>False Priest</i>. ""Flunkt Sass vs. the Root Plume"" echoes the melodrama of <i>False Priest</i>'s ""Casualty of You"" and the more despairing tangents on <i>Skeletal Lamping</i>, and in the sequence serves as a mournful coda to the devastation of ""Black Lion Massacre"". It's effective and moving, but not the finest example of Barnes' work in this mode. ""Slave Translator"" and ""L'age D'or"" have less spark-- decent, mildly funky tracks that hit their mark but sound very much like outtakes.</p>
<p>The keeper here is ""Holiday Call"", which starts off in the agitated funk vein of other songs from the <i>False Priest</i> era but concludes with an inspired extended instrumental outro with Middle Eastern-accented strings. Like ""Black Lion Massacre"", this section is a departure for the band, though its graceful, melodic sound feels like a more natural progression from where Of Montreal have gone on their last few albums. ""Holiday Call"" and ""Black Lion Massacre"" aren't among Barnes' best songs, but they are bold and show that he's an artist who is eager to challenge himself rather than stick to what has become a very successful formula. Hopefully the next full Of Montreal record will find the band continuing on in this adventurous direction.</p></div>"|15360.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15360-thecontrollersphere-ep/|6.6|Matthew Perpetua

This is a poignant title for an album that's being released after the dissolution of the band that made it. The group in question formed in Perth, Western Australia, while the members were still in high school. They made their name in their hometown, but moved to Britain a few years ago to brave a bigger market, as a number of Aussie bands have done before them. They wound up split in two, the rhythm section in Iceland, the guitarists/vocalists/other-stuffists in Britain, everyone working day jobs to keep the band alive. From the sound of it, somewhere in the making of their third album, the band seems to have realized it would be the last. On <i>Absence</i>, Snowman is already a ghost.</p>
<p>Their second album, 2008's <i>The Horse, the Rat and the Swan</i>, was a fiercely unique, grotesque and aggressive album, twisting surf, electro, punk, and metal into a visceral, raw sound that was by turns punishing and gorgeous. <i>Absence</i> works off that synthesis to much different ends, preserving the aggressive energy and gut-punch impact of its predecessor while largely dropping that album's musical directness. Here, the surf guitars are held mostly in check, a voice is never raised in anger or torment, and the focus is on pillow-y harmony vocals and ethereal texture. And with the change, the band has somehow made an album that's even more unsettling, dark, and downright frightening than what came before it.</p>
<p>Three members of the band-- guitarists Joe McKee and Andy Citawarman, and bassist Olga Hermaniussen-- sing, and the way they've recorded their vocals, they bleed into a haunted wash where the words become less important than the sounds. You can catch phrases here and there-- McKee intoning, ""half awake/half asleep,"" on ""A Vanishing Act"", for instance-- but it seems almost beside the point to try and draw out lyrics from this music. There is a primordial force behind the songs that's much more important. It's what makes the hair-raising repetition of the word ""hyena"" on ""Hyena"" so effective. It's just a word for an animal, repeated over and over, but the way they surround it with terse guitar and synth phrases, poltergeist drumming, and an unresolved chord sequence packs it with icy menace. This hyena isn't taking a bath under a tree-- it's coming for you, and you can practically feel its breath on your neck during the buildup two minutes in.</p>
<p>The band has made an especially impressive trick out of working similar sounds for different overall effect on this album. Ross DiBlasio's drums are often the change agent-- they might add nothing more than a time-keeping thump and click on one song, and on the next they're crashing through the more ambient sounds like a hammer through glass, ratcheting up the anxiety rather than pushing the beat. It really is too bad that this will be the band's final release, because Snowman had firmly established themselves as a force to be reckoned with.</p></div>"|15362.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15362-absence/|8.0|Joe Tangari

Outside of Guido's great <i>Anidea</i> LP from 2010, the Bristol scene's been weirdly quiet since that initial boom. Quiet except for young producer Hyetal (real name David Corney), who made heads turn last summer with his killer ""Phoenix"" 12"". Pushing an atmospheric, quickly fluctuating style, the song seemed to nudge ""purple"" into a spacier, more ethereal realm.</p>
<p>Even with its lush builds and laserbeam synth breakdowns, ""Phoenix"" still had a thumping bass undercurrent, and anyone expecting that kind of club appeal may be surprised with the direction Hyetal's taken on <i>Broadcast</i>, his debut LP. Rather than pack the album with similarly bouncy floor-fillers, Corney's instead built a more sprawled-out, home-listening experience that takes its cues from film scores (John Carpenter and <i>Tron</i> feel like big reference points) and 80s synth music. But unlike the work of, say, Ford &amp; Lopatin, this doesn't feel like a nostalgia trip-- for one, the production is clean and expensive-sounding, and the vibe is more future-vision than flashback.</p>
<p>There isn't a lot of thrust or outright melody (if it's big hooks you're after, you might want to look elsewhere), but Corney does excel at creating color and environment. With the chugging ""Beach Scene""-- all clattering percussion and sparkly synth interplay-- it's easy to imagine the movie sequence this could be soundtracking. And even though bass and dubstep elements take a backseat on the record, Corney does occasionally incorporate them: ""Searchlight"" balances the album's headier aspirations with straight-up groove, weaving in a vocal house sample and propulsive, muted bass.</p>
<p>There are a few tracks here, ""The Chase"" and ""Transmission"" among them, that don't work as well; then Corney's vibe-building starts feeling too much like background listening. Perhaps because he's tried to make <i>Broadcast</i> an <i>album</i>, with thoughtful pacing and sequencing, he sometimes loses focus on what sounds best. (You see this a lot when dance-music producers get their first crack at a full-length-- e.g., Darkstar's 2010 debut.) The record also occasionally sounds too polished-- the production is generally very good, but without even a trace of grit or noise it can feel a bit neutered at times. Outside of that, Hyetal's first is a mature and accomplished album.</p></div>"|15370.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15370-broadcast/|7.2|Joe Colly

You like having your music-nerd buttons pushed by recognizable snippets of canonical rock and pop favorites? Well, here they are crumbling to scraps, rattling around like superballs in a laundromat tumble dryer or burning like overheated film stock. Whether they were specific moments of instantly identifiable songs or a more generalist interpretation of certain genres, the way these loops were fed through Forrest's unpredictable yet danceable breakcore rhythms was invigoratingly grotesque.</p>
<p><i>The Everything </i>isn't quite as manic, however, and it doesn't have as many dramatic moments where well-known decades-old pop context gets flayed to bits. Instead, the album is driven by a wide-ranging eclecticism that doesn't get much footing in one overarching style, often swapping out Forrest's most well-known tendencies towards smithereen-reassembling genre clashes for a more analog breakbeat sound. It's not a bad idea-- there are plenty of intriguing possibilities for what a Jason Forrest track could sound like without the K-tel-in-a-woodchipper approach at work, since half the fun was what he did with the bass and drums that didn't rely on reinterpretive trickery. But the branching out necessitates a bit of an identity crisis, one that takes some getting used to.</p>
<p>The two longest tracks are also the trickiest to get a grasp on, though for different reasons. ""Italian Lessons"" pulls together a disorienting synthesis of disco, prog, and suspense film scoring that plays out like an elaborate suite. The sprawl of ""Archive"" is a bit less focused-- you could blame the beat's attention-deficit wandering from Chicago juke to hardcore jungle with a few gratuitous breakdowns thrown in-- but it could just be that the same hyperactive pattern-switching that worked so well on <i>Unrelenting Songs </i>and <i>Shamelessly Exciting </i>feels less convincing when it's overlaid with cheap, tinny keyboard horns instead of finely-diced samples.</p>
<p>Some inspired sample-based tracks do still show up, thankfully, even if they're not the same hilarious corruptions of famous hits that made Forrest notorious. ""Raunchy"" and ""Keys to the Door"" take a couple different tacks-- the former, a choppy splice-job of twangy guitars that shambles its way from straightforward big-beat blues to a torrent of  catastrophic noise, the latter a bit of vibes-heavy fusion-jazz loopwork that feels like a lost highlight from one of MF DOOM's <i>Metal Fingers </i>beat records. But it's clear that Forrest doesn't need to lean on glitchy loop-tweaking to create tracks that stick in your mind. The snarling guitar on ""Crime of the Century"" had to have come from some hard rock nugget somewhere, but it doesn't drive the track as prominently as the beat does, a snaky dubstep pulse that sounds like Distance with a grudge. And the title track's simply a crowd-pleasing take on mid-80s Mantronix-style boom-clap beats-- albeit one that gradually overwhelms itself and disintegrates into waves of synthesized decay.

Start with his set-up-- a single keyboard and a handful of pre-recorded beats. Then there's the way he plays. The first time I saw him perform, he sat pretty still, playing chords and note patterns that required little motion. He only really moved between songs, leaning over to pop in a new cassette that would provide the next rhythm. When I saw him a few weeks ago, things had become even simpler-- he had traded his tape player for a drum machine which he would tap once at the beginning of each song before turning back to his keyboard.</p>
<p>As simple as Osborne's process is, his music might be even simpler. There's no singing, no rhythmic turns, no complex structures or abrupt changes in tone. Each song relies on patience and repetition to produce its particular effect. Every so often, on both his self-titled 2008 debut and his new album <i>Earth Grid</i>, he'll drift into a cloud of ambience or a beat-less drone. But most of the time, he builds a small, basic melody over a small, basic beat, riding that pair of steady horses off into a hypnotic sunset.</p>
<p>Whether you'll follow basically depends on whether you find a trembling keyboard chord something to get lost in or just a reason to get lost. There aren't a lot of bands that sound like Zomes, but the way the music unfolds and the kind of freezing effect it has on my brain reminds me of American Analog Set's keyboard-centered songs. When that band would settle into a swaying instrumental stretch, their devotion to repetition was addictive. The best songs on <i>Earth Grid </i>have that quality, burrowing notes far enough into your psyche that you start to crave them.</p>
<p>Burrow is the right verb for this record, as Osborne never deviates from his chosen sonic path. The album that preceded it had a wider range of tone and tempos, sounding practically diverse in comparison. But that's not really a mark against <i>Earth Grid. </i>Besides, asking for variety from a project that's so clearly about one idea is a little absurd. What matters is that the guns Osborne sticks to are powerful enough to reward the dedication. When he hits his targets, the idea of faulting him for not doing something different is about the furthest thing from my mind.</p></div>"|15381.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15381-earth-grid/|7.0|Marc Masters

Their <i>Sun Giant</i> EP and self-titled debut LP, both released in 2008, brimmed with inviting melodies, evocative lyrics, and open-armed harmonizing that seemed designed to reach a wide variety of listeners. Their bright folk-rock sound wasn't exactly ""cool,"" but that was sort of the point-- it's familiar in the most pleasing way, lacking conceit or affectation. Their expression of their love for music (and making music) was refreshing three years ago, and that sort of thing never gets old.</p>
<p>But clouds inevitably roll in. On the band's follow-up, <i>Helplessness Blues</i>, the mood is darker and more uncertain, adding shade to their gold-hued sound. The change in tone reflects the tumultuous road Fleet Foxes traveled during the album's creation. In late 2009, Fleet Foxes had an album's worth of songs ready, but the tracks were mostly scrapped before mixing. The arduous creative process took a toll on the group members, particularly singer/songwriter Robin Pecknold, who <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/37282-fleet-foxes-robin-pecknold-talks-next-album-side-projects-creative-struggle/"" target=""_blank"">told Pitchfork</a> at the time, ""The last year has been a really trying creative process where I've not been knowing what to write or how to write.""</p>
<p>The group's persistence paid off, though: <i>Helplessness Blues</i> is comparatively deeper, more intricate, and more complex, a triumphant follow-up to a blockbuster debut. Working again with producer Phil Ek, they've crafted a cavernous record that allows more room for them to breathe and stretch. The album's longer, episodic cuts contain disquieting shifts in tone. ""The Plains/Bitter Dancer"", for example, begins as a spindly, psychedelic folk tune reminiscent of some of the Zombies' more introspective moments, and then, after a brief pause, bursts suddenly into the type of gangland chorus Fleet Foxes have practically trademarked by now. Elsewhere, shorter songs seem to end mid-thought; the rollicking tumble of ""Battery Kinzie"" cuts off suddenly, while ""Sim Sala Bim""'s heavy-strummed raga quickly unfurls like broken strings. This battle between tension and serenity is new to the band's repertoire, and it lends the album a compelling uneasiness that starkly contrasts the sunnier disposition of their first two releases.</p>
<p>The group harmonies that flowed from <i>Fleet Foxes</i> are in shorter supply here, employed largely to embellish tracks, allowing Pecknold to take a clearer lead role, both vocally and lyrically. He first emerged as an impressionistic songwriter, but he's since become stronger and more descriptive, conjuring vivid imagery of men striking matches on suitcase latches and penny-laden fountains. Mostly, he spends time working out his own personal puzzles, pondering the big questions of existence and meditating on the dissolution of his five-year relationship during one of <i>Helplessness Blues</i>' more difficult creative periods.</p>
<p>The record reflects his determination to deal with the present while leaving the past behind. At times, Pecknold's voice takes an aggressive tone, as on the eight-minute breakup saga ""The Shrine/An Argument""; other times, it cracks slightly, exposing his pain on the bittersweet ""Lorelai"". But the warmth is there. On the album's most intimate track, ""Someone You'd Admire"", he contemplates the contradictory impulses to love and to destroy, accompanied by spare harmony and softly strummed guitar.</p>
<p>Pecknold confronts more universal concerns as well, starting with ""Montezuma""'s memorable album-opening lines: ""So now, I am older/ Than my mother and father/ When they had their daughter/ Now, what does that say about me?"" He wrestles throughout the record with his own measurements of success, and whether any of it adds up to anything. He asks questions only to come up with more questions, and they all lead into a sort of resolution on the album's title track, ""Helplessness Blues"". Here, he retreats from the world into idyllic, pastoral imagery and wishes for a simpler life before trying to come to grips with his newfound renown. ""Someday I'll be like the man on the screen,"" he promises at the end of the song.</p>
<p><i>Helplessness Blues</i>' analytical and inquisitive nature never tips into self-indulgence. Amidst the chaos, the record showcases the band's expanded range and successful risk-taking, while retaining what so many people fell in love with about the group in the first place. And once again, a strong sense of empathy is at the heart of what makes Fleet Foxes special. Much has been made of American indie's recent obsession with nostalgic escapism, but Robin Pecknold doesn't retreat. He confronts uncertainty while feeling out his own place in the world, which is something a lot of us can relate to.</p></div>"|15363.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15363-helplessness-blues/|8.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

The two of them also penned crucial lines regarding 1988: ""fresh for 88, you suckas"" introduced Boogie Down Productions' <i>By All Means Necessary</i>, one of many essential records from what's considered the greatest year in hip-hop history. It was also the height of the crack epidemic and Jay's boast that ""I'm still spendin' money from 88"" inspired many of his peers to back up their hustling résumé with similar claims. That's a lot of history for an underground producer/MC from a humble Midwestern city to invoke, and Columbus native Blueprint's otherwise personable debut, <i>1988</i>, predictably suffered from it, hamstrung by Golden Age hagiography and pedantic moralizing about the current landscape. While the title of <i>Adventures in Counter-Culture </i>is a fair indication that he hasn't gotten over his hang-ups, it's fortunately a bit of false advertising: This is an ambitious, diverse, and less agenda-driven record.</p>
<p>It's heartening to hear Blueprint acknowledging how things have changed not just since 1988 but <i>1988 </i>as well. Heavy-handed references to ""Welcome to the Terrordome"" and <i>Do the Right Thing </i>are wisely exchanged for a wide range of sounds that can occasionally work against <i>Adventures </i>by making it sound too diffuse: Electro touches up against holistic R&amp;B sessions, aerobic funk giving way to trudging goth that owes much to Eminem. For all of his carping about radio trends, Blueprint indulges in the most prominent of all-- rebranding himself as a rap&amp;B hybrid-- but the results are surprisingly impressive: Whether within the joyous rave-up of ""So Alive"" or the fluttering guitar lines and brushed drums of ""Welcome Home"", 'Print's supple vocals sound less like pop-radio hedgebetting than something that similar curmudgeon-turned-crooner Phonte accomplished quite nicely on recent Foreign Exchange albums.</p>
<p>Happily, he's still got too much of his soul and lyricism invested in the rap game to make that leap quite yet. In the tradition of Rhymefest or Obie Trice or Black Milk, Blueprint's occasionally animated flow is ultimately backed up by heartland humility, self-reliance cut with a large dose of self-deprecation. Hustle isn't a metaphor for him, but a quantification of worth. But as on <i>1988</i>, his most compelling target is himself-- single ""Keep Bouncing"" is a thoroughly written tribute to barely functional alcoholism that's either as funny or sad as you want it to be. Even if it's focused on how a minor celebrity can score free drinks from fans and low-level groupies, brief asides about shitty bar bands and intoxicated misanthropy (""I probably wouldn't kick it with y'all if I was sober/ Vagrant, dick out pissin' in the corner"") make it painfully real.</p>
<p>It's understandable that Blueprint pines on ""The Clouds"" to advance beyond the limited financial rewards of the indie scene he so compellingly raps about, but as with <i>1988</i>, his likeability is inversely related to the scope of his targets. When he zooms in, a face-to-face bank exchange on ""Stole Our Yesterday"" becomes a heavy and thoughtful micro-drama of technological disenfranchisement. But on ""Keep Bouncing"", we get an inexplicable pop-rap rant about celebutante culture that works on the level of Good Charlotte's ""Lifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous"".</p>
<p>That sort of duality is most pronounced on ""Radio-Inactive"", a dramatic, regal march that finds Blueprint reveling in success that was undoubtedly hard-won. And yet, as fans tell him, ""you're the main reason we don't turn our radios on,"" it comes off like preordained back-patting-- the lines about endless nights shaking hands and passing out flyers feel based in experience, while nearly any time he takes shots at sucker DJs, gutless execs, or pop rappers, it comes off as playing to type and making hay out of strawmen. Blueprint can be so effective when he's down to earth, it's a shame he feels the need to step up on a soapbox.</p></div>"|15368.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15368-adventures-in-counter-culture/|6.6|Ian Cohen

It's VIP-lounge funk, it's video-game grain, it's John Hughes movie balladry put through the wash, it's goofy electro-pop, it conjures visions of the keytar-- it's a variety of styles that no one band would've synthesized in the 1970s and 80s but that end up sloshing together in Pants' fuzzy, one-man-band memory of his own record collection. (And yes, I'll relish in taking the opportunity to call him ""Pants"" from here on.)</p>
<p>Part of what's interesting about his particular mode of retro is that he often goes after sounds that were unusual or anachronistic to begin with. Songs like ""Strange Girl"" or ""Darlin"", for example, remind me of Suicide, a late-70s group that was trying to recapture the simplicity and cool of 50s balladry in its own acidic way. Or ""Beta"", which, vocals aside, sounds a little like the Fall, an 80s band that made efforts to recapture the thudding and gleeful repetition of late-60s proto-punk and krautrock. At several points, he sounds a lot like now-labelmate Gary Wilson, an experimental R&amp;B singer most famous in the mainstream for being namechecked by Beck on <i>Odelay</i>, but most artistically valuable for his efforts to reconcile long passages of exploratory keyboard dissonance and mouthbreathing vocals with smooth jams.</p>
<p>The memory games are fun, especially with someone who seems to listen to music as lovingly and deeply as Pants. And even if you aren't steeped in weird old records (and don't care about them unless they've been reissued in the past five years), it doesn't matter-- like Ariel Pink, Pants is making the kind of seamless and intensely retro music more representative of the American underground circa 2011 than any particular place and time during the 1980s.</p>
<p><i>James Pants</i> is his third album, less goofy and party-focused than 2008's <i>Welcome</i>, and a little less brooding and funky than 2009's <i>Seven Seals</i>. He started out as an intern at Stones Throw, the label that not only ended up signing him but more recently put out records by Gary Wilson and guys like Bruce Haack: white mad-scientist types who had an impact on underground black music for their exploration of how bleep-and-bloop could work in the context of music that was related to conventional R&amp;B and funk. Pants follows in that tradition (if you could properly call it a tradition, considering Haack and Wilson's impact seems more accidental than calculated), but he also exists on a vector with guys like Dâm-Funk and Madlib-- artists who not only play in the stylistic cracks of obscure, beat-oriented music, but make records that sound like they're stuck in a past era that, paradoxically, never existed.</p></div>"|15305.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15305-james-pants/|6.7|Mike Powell

To anyone familiar with either the sunny Swedish collective or the gnashing Brooklyn pedal-mongers, this juxtaposition ought to be a little strange, maybe even funny. Sure, A Place to Bury Strangers issued their bleakly pummeling debut the same summer Emanuel Lundgren and his beaming band of Swedes were charming the crowds at their first-ever Lollapalooza, which proves-- actually, it proves absolutely nothing. But just making the comparison underscores how much has changed since 2007.</p>
<p>I'm From Barcelona, to their credit, have tried to change, too-- no easy task for a group peaking at 29 members. On the probably inevitable sophomore slump, <i>Who Killed Harry Houdini?</i>, they added nuance, melancholy, and an orchestral-pop epic finale that begins with a ""giant silver labrador"" and ends with Lundgren achingly insisting, ""In my heart, I'm still a kid."" Limited to 200 vinyl-only copies, 2010 triple-LP <i>27 Songs From Barcelona</i> flipped the group's communal script on its head, giving each band member a song to sing solo, resulting in a wider variety of styles.</p>
<p>The band's third proper album, their second for the storied Mute label, generally shines with much the same chorus-of-your-pals friendliness as the debut. If you didn't like I'm From Barcelona when they first <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Wi1d0FNgdQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">introduced</a> themselves, probably no use catching up with them now. For listeners who saw in the group's Broadway-sized tweeness a way to convey indie pop's intimacy on a massive sing-along scale-- to teach the world to sing ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding"" in perfect social-democratic harmony-- well, there's good news and there's bad news.</p>
<p>Taken on its own terms, <i>Forever Today</i> offers plenty of upbeat, jingle-ready tunes with universal themes and a now 27-member band's worth of voices, handclaps, strings, horns, guitars, keyboards, bass, and so on; think Ra Ra Riot with some extra Swedish polish. The album grooves a bit more than before, particularly on the synth-poppy first single ""Get in Line"" (paradoxically, a sing-along about anti-conformity) and the ""Heart of Glass""-shuffling ""Skipping a Beat"". And there's more insight into the music that makes these guys tick: a song that lists off different types of birds is named after maybe the greatest Bird of them all, ""Charlie Parker"", while ""Dr. Landy"" frets to a shrink about how <i>Rubber Soul</i> and ""Be My Baby"" changed the narrator's life. In a festival context, with such an unusual group (the Polyphonic Spree and Danielson are both different; so's Broken Social Scene), this stuff should still be enough to turn a few heads.</p>
<p>What's ultimately confounding about the album is how one-note its euphoria can be. The songs are almost interchangeable; the lyrics rarely stray beyond the easy cliché (""You gotta stay true to your heart"" may be nice advice, but it's dull). Worse, I'm From Barcelona appear to be subtly shifting from artists who illuminate the problems of growing up by using childhood as a <i>metaphor</i> to artists who sing songs that might be best loved by, well, children. Then there's the fact that where I'm From Barcelona, the Boy Least Likely To, and others typically emphasize cuteness and sing about a protracted childhood, some of the most compelling voices on deferred adulthood in recent years have sampled hazily remembered 1980s pop and sung about a sort of protracted adolescence. But evolving trends aren't really the problem here: Younger acts like Cults, for one, definitely haven't been shy about brandishing their glockenspiels. ""Do what you do, and do it all the way,"" sing I'm from Barcelona on <i>Forever Today</i>'s closing title track. Again, a pretty good recommendation, but sometimes it still won't be quite enough to please everybody.</p></div>"|15374.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15374-forever-today/|6.1|Marc Hogan

Named for the AC/DC song, the band showed up in 2004 with ""Two Covers for Your Party"", a split 12"" on which they rendered Mr. Oizo's ear-worming, puppet-moving ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv6Ewqx3PMs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flat Beat</a>"" and Benny Benassi's robotically sexual dancefloor staple ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5bYDhZBFLA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Satisfaction</a>"" in the style of loose disco-rock. Fleshing out the latter's Mac voice duet with a sneering Sex Pistols accent and house diva vocals for good measure, the 12"" was great silly fun.</p>
<p>WhoMadeWho kept the lighthearted mood largely intact for their self-titled debut full length the following year, bassist Tomas Hoffding singing frivolous lyrics in gliding falsetto or louche <i>sotto voce</i> while drummer Tomas Barfod (aka electronic producer TomBoy) and jazz-vet guitarist Jeppe Kjellberg crafted upbeat grooves. Follow-up <i>The Plot</i> was equally lightweight in its lyrics, but the music was starting to show the slightest signs of mellowing-- the bass lines were a little less rubbery, the drumming a little less cluttered, the guitar riffs a little less gaudy, everything just a little less exuberant. For <i>Knee Deep</i>, the band has made the leap from Gomma, a label specializing in playful disco, to Kompakt, long-reigning kings of melancholy minimal-techno pop, and they continue their gradual slide toward chillier, moodier dance rock.</p>
<p>The album opens with the ponderous ""There's an Answer"", foghorn synths blowing in the background, while Hoffding sings about a contemplative walk on the beach. ""Every Minute Alone"" starts on a similarly dour note-- all tense chiming guitar and low vocal groans-- but it eventually picks up speed, seesawing synth and vocals swelling to a crescendo before breaking into a coda of righteously squealing saxophone. It's like this throughout the album-- one morose moment gives way to a brief fit of action, then back again; kinetic dance grooves are anchored by downcast melodies and lyrical sentiments.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's more that the whole album plays like a bad mood gradually being shaken off, so that by the second half, it almost feels like that party where three Danish jokers were covering ""Flat Beat"" for you just a moment ago. ""Two Feet Off Ground"" revs things up nicely, with busy ping-ponging synth arpeggios and genuinely rocking drums. The album goes out on the strobing rave-up of ""555"" before tacking on a few negligible remixes of ""Every Minute Alone"", the best of which comes from Kompakt boss Michael Mayer, who gives it a typically slow, stretched-out treatment, with just a hint of acid in the muffled distance.</p>
<p>Certainly, the contrast of big tunes and bummer moods isn't a new approach for rock/electronic hybrids-- acts from New Order on up through Cut Copy and Hot Chip have long worked that intersection to great effect-- and even the downbeat songs are spiked with lively touches: the rippling kick drums on ""All That I Am"", the vamping, icy synths that emerge out of ""Musketeer""'s murk. This is still playful stuff, just more subtly so. But to see WhoMadeWho settle into this mode feels like a significant loss of <i>joie de vivre</i> from a group who were once some of dance music's most flagrant disco clowns.</p></div>"|15382.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15382-knee-deep/|6.7|Eric Grandy

That was around the time Times New Viking made the jump from Siltbreeze, an outpost for the proudly abrasive and frayed, to Matador, an institution that has flirted with the mainstream since their 1990s heyday. The commercial prospects were curious: How well could they sell a band renowned for dropping hooks behind minefields of growl? Surely, Times New Viking, a trio of art-school grads and Guided By Voices disciples, would clean up their act. They didn't. Their first LP as indie rock big leaguers, <i>Rip It Off</i>, opened with ""Teen Drama"", a song whose every bar was so distorted, ill-tempered, and flat-out mean, it would have been almost too aggressive to try matching it as the record progressed. They did.</p>
<p>But that record ended up becoming a harbinger of noise to come. 2008 and 2009 saw a slew of young bands exploring pop and punk with comparable verve. The word ""lo-fi"" became a term nerds could use again to describe new music recorded on a budget, a large swathe of which became dedicated to mellow yellow beach energies, the exact opposite of the confrontational place where Times New Viking found their center. It wasn't just for lack of a studio: They were a band unflinching in its commitment to ensuring its music sound definitively fucked up.</p>
<p>After one more equally gnarled full-length and the longest break between any such release (a startling two years) for the Columbus, Ohio trio, they've left for another landmark label, one run by a bunch of Matador defectors: Merge Records. <i>Dancer Equired</i> marks the end of said break and their debut as part of the Merge family. And, much like a slew of contemporaries who've recently made the switch to cleaner, relatively gussied-up studio recordings (No Age, Smith Westerns, Wavves, Cloud Nothings, and former labelmate Kurt Vile), it's also their first LP without the noise that sheathed their work from the start. While many of those artists have
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
since released their finest work to date by stripping away a lot of the dissonance, the same can't be said of <i>Dancer Equired</i>. Though revealing, this probably wasn't the right set of songs to unveil in the process.</p>
<p>Opener ""It's a Culture"" is brisk but out of tune, almost to the point where it feels as though all those sour notes are a simple substitute for distortion. The same problem can be heard prominently in ""California Roll"", a number that sputters then sags while keyboardist/vocalist Beth Murphy makes a mess of the space vocally. And elsewhere, you'll find careless takes in ""More Rumours"" and broken ukulele closer ""No Good"", a song whose title feels like a setup. It's an approach that more or less nullifies the decision to open up their sonics, and to a degree, functions as another security blanket: If these songs sound wholeheartedly tossed-off, then they also can't be taken that seriously either. While it's definitely easier now to discern the layers of a Times New Viking song, it's become more difficult to ascertain whether or not this is a record that exposes serious shortcomings that were there all along.</p>
<p>That's because <i>Dancer Equired</i> also features some truly great moments as well. While neither Murphy nor drummer Adam Elliott are particularly strong vocalists, they've never needed to be up until now. ""No Room to Live"" boasts both a terrific melody and the kind of harmonic streamlining that's forgotten in most corners of the record. The zing of ""Fuck Her Tears"" more than suggests that they're capable of crafting spirited hooks out in the open, too. This record is in no way the full-fledged leap in fidelity or accessibility they could have made, but ditching all that racket has clarified something significant: It wasn't so effective because it obscured what they were doing, but rather, it amplified the menace inherent in their best moments. Just like in the case of ""Teen Drama"", you can still hear some of that in ""Try Harder"" or ""Want to Exist"", songs that sound like these three might gnash their teeth and bear those fangs at any second. We know they're in there.</p></div>"|15357.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15357-dancer-equired/|6.0|David Bevan

It was a good enough comparison for me to remember it a decade later. Like Elastica, Ladytron are a co-ed band built on detachment, androgyny, black clothing, and tons of hooks. Also like Elastica, they were dogged at the start as being vacant fashionistas photocopying the past. A few blinks of the eye later, and Ladytron have been around for a dozen years, and the requisite 17-track <i>Best of 00-10</i> compilation feels earned. (An expanded version adds 16 more tracks and a huge booklet of photos; depending on your interest in the group, one or the other will certainly qualify as all the Ladytron you'll need.)</p>
<p>Out of the gate, Ladytron dovetailed with and were lumped in with electroclash. They certainly preceded the term, but the group benefited from it and earned quite a bit early attention on the back of it. At the time, they got by on charm, low-rent production, and a few winks. Songs like ""Paco!"" and ""He Took Her to a Movie"" feel like defining electroclash documents-- the deadpan vocals, the fairly rudimentary comments on consumerism and sexual politics. Part of the goal, and this was an epidemic in electroclash, was to coat everything in a layer of irony. Trying hard, ambition, giving a shit-- these weren't desired qualities. Cheapness, disposability, peacocking-- these were in style. By that measurement, Ladytron succeeded-- only two tracks from their debut LP, <i>604</i>, are featured here: ""Discotraxx"" and ""Playgirl"", a couple of gossipy girltalk songs, observational character sketches that draw different conclusions about young women growing up quickly. (Compilers: ""Commodore Rock"" was jobbed.)</p>
<p>It came as a surprise when Ladytron went right out and grew up. Stepping up their tempos, sharpening their rhythms and low-ends, and acquiring a sheen of professionalism, they took a step toward longevity on their next record, <i>Light &amp; Magic</i> (2002). The results weren't as strong as <i>604</i>, but they carved a way out of what looked like a trendy dead-end. Darkening the tone of their songs and providing more muscle to their sound, Ladytron graduated from a concept into a band. And yet from the record only ""Seventeen""-- a lament that could have been penned for the girls who grew up too fast on <i>604</i>-- is truly first-tier.</p>
<p>The band itself may have gotten that message: Evolve or risk being left out. They evolved: The leap on their next album, <i>Witching Hour</i>, was stark. Bottle service and velvet ropes are entirely absent; a confident, poised blend of goth, shoegaze, and rock instead characterizes the album-- by far their career peak. It's no surprise that five of the 17 tracks here, including arguably its three best (""Destroy Everything You Touch"", ""Soft Power"", ""International Dateline""), are from that album.</p>
<p>Ladytron continued their morphing into theater-rock on 2008's <i>Velocifero</i>; the three singles included here-- ""Ghosts"", ""Tomorrow"", and ""Runaway""-- find them perilously close to Killers territory, but they're talked down from the ledge by Helen Marnie's vocals. With a more demonstrative or earnest singer in tow, the band may have been tempted to graft itself to songs that aim for scope over subtlety. A sense of humor and keying in on specific images or lyrical ideas have always suited Ladytron, so a drift toward more big-tent songs would be unlikely to yield anything other than vague plaudits.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be a 21st century compilation without a few add-ons. There's a new song, ""Ace of Hz"", and a cover of Death in June's ""Little Black Angel"". Both are decent songs that won't raise eyebrows tacked onto the back end of a band's best work, but would never be considered career highlights on their own. Some of the playfulness of their early days is missed on <i>Best of 00-10</i>, the loose analog charm of their earliest songs would have given the collection a little more lift. (How odd would it have sounded a decade ago to say a Ladytron comp would suffer from being too leaden?) But these 17 songs collectively are a hell of a strong argument for why you're still reading about Ladytron now instead of, say, Miss Kittin or Fischerspooner or Peaches.</p></div>"|15377.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15377-best-of-00-10/|8.2|Scott Plagenhoef

Previous Prefuse records highlighted the glitch-hop production style that Herren pretty much perfected on 2003's <i>One Word Extinguisher</i>; here though, Herren hews closer to the psychedelia of his recent collaborations with Zola Jesus.</p>
<p>Prefuse's works are often inward-focused and clipped, with melodic ideas constantly shooting off in different directions-- usually in the same song. Vocals and guest raps are cut up too, with Herren employing them as rhythmic elements within his productions. The guest vocals on <i>The Only She Chapters </i>are all female, and instead of being chopped-up, Herren allows them to stretch and play out, obscuring them with layers rather than edits.</p>
<p>""The Only Trial of 9000 Suns"" features the late Broadcast singer Trish Keenan, a wonderfully distinctive vocalist, but Herren's production buries her voice in a psychedelic swirl, moving in and out of focus.  Minor-key textures clash against each other, and with no space for anything to rise out of the haze and anchor the movement, the song ends up feeling aimless.</p>
<p>""The Only Hand to Hold"" has more clarity, with My Brightest Diamond's Shara Worden contributing a gorgeous vocal over restrained bursts of hiss and faraway guitars. It sounds a little esoteric, but Worden spins sweet harmonies and offers the record's most accessible and haunting few minutes. The track is one of the only moments that works in isolation on a record that otherwise seamlessly folds into itself, as Herren rings out any empty spaces. It's an approach that can make for an exhausting, sometimes daunting listen.</p>
<p>Zola Jesus contributes on ""The Only Direction in Concrete"", and while she is heavily clipped, her vocal character shines through, as her lurching, bellow-y tone punctures layers of digital swarm. Her usual darkly gothic guise is transformed into something earthier, which works well within Herren's framework. Late album highlight ""The Only Serenidad"" feels like a welcome relief from the scale of Herren's labyrinthine production, inserting glitchy rhythms into a morphing vocal sample above waves of gliding static. It's one of the few moments where Herren's strong ear for melody filters through unobstructed and easily captures a sense of melancholy.</p>
<p><i>The Only She Chapters</i> feels more expansive than Herren's often miniature-scale productions, meditating on small ideas for long periods,  recalling motifs and melodies throughout. Too often, though, these ideas aren't strong enough to sustain the stretching, and the melodic elements aren't as involving as previous Prefuse 73 material. It's dense and impressive production work, but not as listenable as Herren at his best.</p></div>"|15356.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15356-the-only-she-chapers/|6.4|Hari Ashurst
