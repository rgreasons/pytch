Theirs is the sort of popularity that’s easy to overlook: the New York duo’s 2010 debut full-length for Barsuk, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13954-eyelid-movies/"" target=""_blank""><i>Eyelid Movies</i></a>, quietly seeped out into a post-chillwave marketplace overrun with atmospheric synth-pop acts, and yet here they are four years later headlining 3,000-cap venues like New York’s Terminal 5 and the Hollywood Palladium. Sure, a few surprise collaborations with the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7749-big-boi/"" target=""_blank"">Big Boi</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"" target=""_blank"">the Flaming Lips</a> may have helped raised their stock in the interim, but, without the benefit of a runway breakout single or viral video, their exponential audience expansion appears to be more a product of old-fashioned word-of-mouth than click-of-mouse. </p>
<p>That said, you could be forgiven for not noticing Phantogram’s ascent because their music likewise rarely calls attention to itself. Upon forming Phantogram, Sarah Barthel and Josh Carter famously dubbed their dream-pop/hip-hop fusion “street beat,” and while it was likely meant to connote their music’s gritty edges and nocturnal ambience, the label also anticipated how easily Phantogram’s songs would be absorbed into the soundtrack of our day-to-day lives. From Urban Outfitters in-store playlists to prime placements on teen TV dramas, Phantogram have achieved a sort-of unobtrusive ubiquity that's made them the new frontrunners of background music.</p>
<p>But on their second full-length, Phantogram look to graduate from the subliminal to the substantial. <i>Voices</i> is the band’s first offering under their new deal with Republic/Universal, and in sharp contrast to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a>-esque log-cabin origin myth surrounding <i>Eyelid Movies</i>, this one was recorded in L.A. with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"" target=""_blank"">M.I.A.</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27635-santigold/"" target=""_blank"">Santigold</a> producer John Hill. While such a transition for an indie-reared act may not carry the same significance as it would have 20 years ago, <i>Voices</i> is nonetheless a quintessential, 1990s-style major-label debut: more heavy-handed and more expensive-sounding, and also exceedingly self-aware of its mission to deliver the goods at this crucial juncture in the band’s career. As a result, the more playful spirit introduced on 2011’s stopgap <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15974-phantogram-nightlife-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Nightlife</i> EP</a> (and its stellar single “Don’t Move”) has been all but extinguished; in its place is a band that’s more serious and driven, but also more stiff.</p>
<p>Though Phantogram now employ a drummer in concerts, the beats here are locked into precise, mechanistic, unwaveringly mid-tempo patterns. So it often falls on Barthel to raise the temperature and quicken the pulse. As we witnessed in <a href=""http://static.businessinsider.com/image/519a2896ecad04cf44000000/image.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">her hair-pulling onstage cameos with the Flaming Lips last year</a>, she’s not afraid to place herself in a vulnerable position in service of a song, and on <i>Voices' </i>most immediately arresting tracks—in particular, the back-to-back, arena-rattling R&amp;B bangers “Black Out Days” and “Fall in Love”—she invests her performances with a heightened sense of desperation that feels raw and real. Likewise, her wistful turn on “Bill Murray” serves as the album’s emotional center; though it doesn’t seem to have anything to do with the iconic actor, the song's soft-focus synth washes and hazy-headed romantic longing would be right at home on the <i>Lost in Translation</i> soundtrack.</p>
<p>As the album title suggests, the songs on <i>Voices</i> are united by themes of inner turmoil and psychosis, but the yearning intensity isn’t always there to back them up. “Howling at the Moon” squanders a tough clanging groove on a tame, buzzkill chorus that undermines the feral desire expressed within; on the skittering, Massive Attack-like “Bad Dreams”, Barthel sums up her mental state by shouting out the title of <span>Buñuel and Dali's</span> <i>Un Chien Andalou</i>, but the effect is decidedly less convincing than <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P3lhrwio-M&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black Francis’ invocation of the same</a>. And though Phantogram favor an alchemical approach to music-making, Barthel and Carter remain oddly discrete personalities, avoiding the sort of he-said/she-said interaction that could lend their music more tension. Barthel may handle 80 percent of Phantogram’s vocals and command 99 percent of the attention, but Carter is still trying to find his voice amid the band’s intricately layered productions. His spotlight-seizing turns here—the Phil Collins-via-<i>In Rainbows</i> pomp of “Never Going Home” and the repetitiously overwrought “I Don’t Blame You”—reek of overcompensation, forsaking the more effective, shadowy presence he presented on the <i>Eyelid Movies</i> highlight “Running From the Cops” for blown-out power balladry.</p>
<p>Since the release of that first album, the indie-pop/R&amp;B crossover zone Phantogram inhabits has become considerably more crowded with mega-hyped breakout acts, and <i>Voices</i> responds accordingly to these higher stakes with a bolder, more assertive approach. But while its standout tracks are strong enough to ensure Phantogram maintains its current altitude, there are a lot of places to turn to for this sort of thing these days, and this album ultimately underwhelms next to the pure-pop punch of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"" target=""_blank"">Haim</a>, the cutting lyricism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31696-lorde/"" target=""_blank"">Lorde</a>, or the radiant grandeur of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30747-chvrches/"" target=""_blank"">Chvrches</a>. As much as <i>Voices</i> tries to get in your head, it too easily recedes to back of mind. </p></div>"|19009.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19009-phantogram-voices/|6.0|Stuart Berman

Several decades too late, as the case may be: The Delia she’s singing about is the title character in the popular murder ballad ""Delia's Gone"", written by Dick Toops and Karl Silbersdorf and recorded by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a>, Harry Belafonte, Waylon Jennings, and multiple times by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/696-johnny-cash/"">Johnny Cash</a>. “The Body Electric” seeks to rescue Delia and so many other murder-ballad victims, offering an empathetic—and feminist—reading of an American folk tradition that lives on today in contemporary covers of “Banks of the Ohio” and “Knoxville Girl"". Murder ballads allow us to act out dark urges, using history to guard us against accusations of sociopathy or misogyny. But Segarra laments our fascination with such abject subject matter: “Shoot me down, put my body in the river,” she sings, “while the whole world sings, sings it like a song/ The whole world sings like there’s nothing going wrong.”</p>
<p>For Segarra, a Bronx-born Puerto Rican who gravitated toward <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/349-bikini-kill/"">Bikini Kill</a> before discovering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14407-woody-guthrie/"">Woody Guthrie</a>, the past is not a thing to be revered. Rather, it must be endlessly, aggressively interrogated. <i>Small Town Heroes</i> borrows liberally from old-time traditions, including Appalachian reels, Big Easy R&amp;B, and Piedmont blues, yet these songs put a fresh and wily spin on old sounds and ideas. Segarra rewrites Jesse Fuller’s “<a href=""http://youtu.be/uBME_J0pf3o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">San Francisco Bay Blues</a>”, retitling it “The New SF Bay Blues” and changing the subject from a wronged woman to a brokedown touring van: “You’ve been a good old wagon/ You got me there in style”). “Crash on the Highway” subtly rewrites Roy Acuff’s “Wreck on the Highway”, its two-step beat evoking the boredom and frustration of backed-up traffic. These are songs about touring as rambling; instead of hitchin’ rides and jumpin’ trains, Segarra and Hurray for the Riff Raff are gigging around the country in a cramped van.</p>
<p><i>Small Town Heroes</i> may not sound like what you’d expect from a New Orleans album, yet it is anchored in that city’s sense of musical adventure. Segarra learned her trade playing in street bands and busking on corners, which has given her a broad musical vocabulary. She arranges and produces these songs as eloquently as she writes them, often using just a few instruments to convey a surprisingly full sound. “Blue Ridge Mountain” opens the album with her clawhammer banjo and what sounds like a clogger working together as a makeshift rhythm section, with Yosi Perlstein’s spry fiddle dancing around them. “No One Else” is built on a folk-rock foundation, yet it pitches and yaws on a rolling piano bassline that might have been learned from an old Fats Domino or Professor Longhair record.</p>
<p>With <i>Small Town Heroes</i>, Segarra proves herself one of the most compelling stylists in a folk revival full of suspicious acts either too beholden to tradition or too uncritical to make much of it. Perhaps the biggest difference between Hurray and its peers is attitude: Segarra understands that these styles don’t need to be revived, so she’s not playing dress-up and isn’t concerned with projecting any sense of rustic authenticity. Instead, she understands that these old sounds still thrum somewhere deep in the American subconscious, even if our relation to them changes with each passing year. With the whole country as its geographical and historical backdrop, <i>Small Town Heroes</i> is an album about how life and music intersect. Rather than play to her record collection, however, Segarra takes the records out of their sleeves, scratches them up, and makes the old music speak to new concerns.</p></div>"|19031.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19031-hurray-for-the-riff-raff-small-town-heroes/|7.8|Stephen M.

It's a sentiment <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28582-leyland-kirby/"">James Leyland Kirby</a> would no doubt agree with, as he sheds various aliases (V/Vm, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29716-the-caretaker/"">the Caretaker</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31677-the-stranger/"">the Stranger</a> among many others) to head out under his own name for his debut EP for the imprint. Kirby often borrows liberally from other sources, so here he aligns those impulses with his surroundings by revisiting sounds that mirror the earlier Apollo releases, giving acres of space to tinny drum machines and soft synth lines that echo into eternity. Anyone familiar with Apollo releases such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/354-biosphere/"">Biosphere</a>'s <i>Microgravity</i> or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/223-selected-ambient-works-85-92/""><i>Selected Ambient Works 85-92</i></a> should find a warm glow of familiarity overcoming them on a cursory glance at <i>Breaks My Heart Each Time</i>.</p>
<p>Kirby's known for his adept way of flitting through contrasting styles, tying on various genres as if he was trying on a new coat or hat. Crucially, he's a picky dresser, and one with a depth of knowledge and intuitive feel for the musical worlds he immerses himself in. There's not always a logical pattern to the paths he chooses, but occasionally there's something resembling a handoff between one record to the next, forming subtle links between his creations. The title track of this release peeks out from behind a blanket of fuzz that feels like a distant cousin to his Caretaker work, although its innards are remarkably different. Here, Kirby plays with elegance and antagonism, the former represented by sheets of drifting synth, and the latter emerging in the piston-like machinery stamped across its surface.</p>
<p>Working in contrasts is something of a theme for Kirby—his V/VM output skewered bland pop on a spike, while his Caretaker releases find light and dark impulses running through the grooves of scratchy old 78rpm records. His explorations here aren't so different, with the minimal beauty of ""Diminishing Emotion"" picking up an undercurrent of isolationist fear as it slowly unravels. <i>Breaks My Heart</i> also deals in pure thrills. ""Staring Down the Sun"" is a dysfunctional club banger that expertly captures the feel of nascent computer music, resembling a paean to the trials and tribulations of running Cubase on Windows 95, its manic race to the finish resembling the panicked wait to see if a save button's progress bar can beat out a blue-screen meltdown. ""Last Ditch Legacy"" is similar, but more joyous in execution, skirting closer to the sunnier outlook of Mixmaster Morris's work for Apollo.</p>
<p>Where Kirby succeeds on <i>Breaks My Heart</i> is by digging in hard to the era he's sourcing. He's working with a familiar sound palette here, but it's more than simple tribute fare—there's a feel for the duality of emotions that runs through that early Apollo work, whether it’s in the mixture of playfulness and sensitivity that runs through <i>Ambient Works 85-92</i>, or in the way something like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fzrPoWanzw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Stella's Cry""</a> by Jam &amp; Spoon set up an optimistic buffer to the darker ambient dreams of a track like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4fJCPD2sxM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cloudwalker II""</a> by Biosphere. There's a sense of care and affinity here, of someone playing around with material that clearly means a lot to them. Naturally, Kirby’s already moved on, prepping another volume of his <i>Intrigue &amp; Stuff</i> series and plotting a full-length release for Apollo in the not-too distant future. Here, he achieves the rare feat of demonstrating exactly how to emulate your heroes without becoming overawed in the process.</p></div>"|19010.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19010-leyland-kirby-breaks-my-heart-each-time/|7.2|Nick Neyland

The young duo's debut LP, <i>Blame Confusion</i>, is a gaussian blur, 37 minutes of speed limit violation, drawing equally on hardcore blister, dream-punk, and raucous cusp-of-the-1990s indie rock. But while Solids don't want for momentum, between their relentless propulsion and the billowing reverb that envelops much of <i>Blame Confusion</i>, they can sometimes lose the song amidst the static.</p>
<p>Drummer Louis Guillemette and singer/guitarist Xavier Germain-Poitras' two-men-and-a-pedal-board set-up has a kindred spirit in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5313-no-age/"" target=""_blank"">No Age</a>; not the tense, peculiar No Age of last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18325-no-age-an-object/"" target=""_blank""><i>An Object</i></a>, but No Age at their most purely tuneful. You might even hear <i>Blame Confusion</i> as a kind of correction to the aggressively experimental <i>An Object</i>; it's something like a No Age record without the ambient passages or the rhythmic left-turns. The occasional rhythmic disruption or burst of static notwithstanding, <i>Blame Confusion</i> mostly just <i>goes</i>, breathlessly careening through its 10 songs at a mostly breakneck clip.</p>
<p>But it's a lack of rising action that gets <i>Blame Confusion</i> into trouble. Whenever Guillemette gets a rhythm up to highway speed, he punches the cruise control; once set, tempos rarely dip, or bend, or do much of anything in the third minute they weren't already doing in the first. And Germain-Poitras' chugging riffs never seem to develop much over the course of these songs; he'll occasionally squeeze a gestural solo or a twinkly little outro into the mix, but it's never quite bold enough to cut through the thick patina of fuzz hanging over <i>Blame Confusion</i>. Most of these songs fall into two categories:  ""Almost Crimes""-style bob-and-weavers like ""Laissez Faire"" or choppy punchers like ""Not Complaining."" But no matter which type of Solids song you find yourself listening to, they're all pretty much the same: a driving—yet somehow static—rhythm, a generous coating of feedback, and a distortion-strangled Germain-Poitras vocal. Solids' perpetual motion would be well served by bolder melodies or trickier rhythms. But, time and again, they opt for a path that's too straight and awfully narrow.</p>
<p>For his part, Germain-Poitras tears into opener ""Over the Sirens"" and the revved-up ""Cold Hands"" like a phlegm-ridden Mac McCaughan. Sadly, these outbursts are short lived. Germain-Poitras he sings most of the rest of <i>Blame Confusion</i> in a weary, faintly stoned voice that frequently gets itself lost in the fog, and his lyrics—from the school of generalized discontent—rarely seem to rise above the fray long enough to give you much to go on. Between its reverb-ensconced sonics, its consistent rhythmic charge, its borderline-nebulous melodies, and Germain-Poitras' intermittently passionate, infrequently audible vocals, wide swaths of <i>Blame Confusion</i> quickly start to bleed together. And whether it's the moony near-ballad ""Haze Away"" or the all-too-infrequent squeal of a solo, you'll probably find yourself clinging to anything on Blame Confusion resembling a break in the fuzz-coated monotony. The hard-driving <i>Blame Confusion</i>, in too big a hurry to stop and take in the scenery, simply lets too much whoosh by in the periphery.</p></div>"|18995.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18995-solids-blame-confusion/|5.8|Paul Thompson

Woods of Desolation’s catalog serves as a logical bridge between the rawer, stripped-down black metal of Forest Mysticism and the atmospheric bummer rock tendencies of Grey Waters—the latter’s influence is given a place of honor on <i>As the Stars</i>. While the band’s always embraced black metal’s melodic potential, the shift from depressive black metal toward something brighter and more refined has been underway for years. The sophomore album, 2011’s <i>Torn Beyond Reason</i>, toyed with shoegaze, and now this third album rocks far more than it rages. That said, <i>As the Stars</i> is still wonderfully atmospheric and melancholy in the deepest of ways.<i></i></p>
<p>While Woods of Desolation is ostensibly a one-man operation, D. has a history of collaboration. This album was created with the help of several musicians, including Ukrainian drummer Vlad (Drudkh), and fellow Aussies bassist Luke Mills (Nazxul, Pestilential Shadows) and vocalist Old of Drohtnung, which left D. free to concentrate on those sublime ringing guitar tones that drive the album forward and upward. Post rock’s trademark tremulous builds and joyous crashing crescendos make up a huge part of the seven compositions, lending a triumphal feel to the overarching despair.</p>
<p>Shades of Katatonia’s mournful benchmark <i>Brave Murder Day</i> swim through the gloomy buildup on “This Autumn Light” and “Withering Field”, while D unabashedly recalls Alcest’s earliest, finest work with many of his more grandiose moments. Seminal Australian depressives Austere leave a mark as well, but given that two members have also played in Woods of Desolation at various points, it could almost be seen as more of a continuation than an outright homage. By now this style of “post black metal” could never be accused of outright originality (it’s all been done before, circa 2007) but the listener is at least owed quality, and Woods of Desolation are happy to deliver. As black metal’s edges continue to soften, it’s heartening to come across a band like this who appreciates their roots but is utterly devoid of consternation about their stylistic decisions. Woods of Desolation have lightened up considerably since 2006, but are living proof that not all progress need be disappointing. They’re far better now than they were then, and <i>As the Stars</i> makes it clear that the band is fully aware of it.</p>
<p>Despite his top shelf assistance, this is still D.’s baby. Old’s vocals are robust and appropriately creaky and Vlad has clearly imparted a little bit of the magic from his main gig into those drum fills, but D.’s virtuosic guitar playing is the primary focus. Sad melodies rendered in tremolo spill forth over a misty landscape of ghostly howls and crashing cymbals to conjure up beauties like “”Anamnesis” with its perky post-punk beat and closing paen “Ad Infinitum” which shines so brightly it feels more like a beginning than an end. The rough spots have been sanded down, polished, and allowed to sparkle, and the result is intoxicating.</p>
<p>Woods of Desolation is a name that should be on the lips of every fan and critic that went apeshit over <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"" target=""_blank"">Deafheaven</a> last year. I’m not about to make a direct comparison between Antwon’s housemates or the fairy-blind French and Woods of Desolation, though, as it must be noted that the latter still stand comfortably within the black metal camp, even with D.’s love for post rock and shoegaze. But it’s beautiful and devastating in that way that all the best albums are, and that in and of itself is worth some attention.</p></div>"|19029.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19029-woods-of-desolation-as-the-stars/|8.0|Kim Kelly

A twangy electric folk tune that begins with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WXYjm74WFI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an invocation of its muse</a>, Hank Williams, the song is all stomp-and-rollick until it stops to catch its breath for a moment in the bridge. “Are you lonely too?” Olsen warbles. A beat later, her band’s back in full Technicolor, and the next line hits like a title card in an old “Batman” episode: “HI-FIVE!/ SO AM I!”</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Olsen’s voice is enchanting; it sounds like the result of a spell that called for Leonard Cohen’s blood, Buffy Sainte-Marie’s larynx, and a still-operational old-timey microphone emblazoned with radio call letters. Her songs are powered by a strange, anarchic electricity, always flickering on the edge of blowing out. By the laws of the unique universe she creates on her records, Wanting, Waiting, and (probably the most popular pastime in her songs) Thinking are not passive stances but active ways of being in the world; unruly emotion is a virtue. “You don’t sing so high and wild,” she sneers at one point to a detached lover, and in an Angel Olsen song this is an insult so harsh it’s almost obscene. This guy may as well be dead.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Olsen first gained notice as the stand-out eccentric in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/351-bonnie-prince-billy/"">Bonnie “Prince” Billy</a>’s mysterious band the Babblers (given that all six of them were known perform in hooded pajamas and sunglasses, this is saying something). In 2010, she released an arresting tape on <a href=""http://batheticrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Bathetic</span></a> called <i>Strange Cacti</i>, which gave off the impression that she’d recorded it after falling down a well, trying to sing loudly and cavernously and urgently enough to be found. And she was, more or less—her cult following multiplied with the release of 2012’s excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17154-half-way-home/""><i>Half Way Home</i></a>, a surreal and lyrical collection of folk songs that sounded a bit like Vashti Bunyan playing a midnight game of Ouija. Most of the songs on <i>Half Way Home</i> were driven by Olsen’s hushed acoustic guitar, so her 2013 single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14712-sweet-dreams/"">“Sweet Dreams”</a> was a thrilling left turn—a swirling, psych-pop reverie. To overpower the percussion and charred electric guitars, she sang even wilder.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Burn Your Fire for No Witness</i><span> picks up where “Sweet Dreams” left off, blossoming into a fuller, louder sound and embracing punchier song structures. It’s not as weird or raw a record as </span><i>Half Way Home</i><span>, but producer John Congleton manages to sand the rough edges off Olsen’s music without quite taming it. She and her band (Joshua Jaeger on drums and Stewart Bronaugh on bass and guitar) talk to each other effortlessly: On the great lead-off single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16342-angel-olsen-forgivenforgotten/"" target=""_blank"">“Fogiven/Forgotten”</a>, the kick drum accents her open-hearted declarations like expertly placed exclamation points (“I don’t know anything!/ But I love you!”), and as the energy of “Lights Out” mounts, she passes the baton to Bronaugh for a perfectly timed solo. The blown-out, full-band energy enlivens Olsen, kindling an intensity that’s always been present in her songs and fanning the flames even higher.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On repeated listens, subtler highlights emerge. ""Enemy"" hangs like a spiderweb in the album's quietest corridor—an intricate wisp of a song that she patiently spins into something hallowed and heartbreaking. Then there’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16616-angel-olsen-white-fire/"" target=""_blank"">“White Fire”</a>, a sparse, nearly seven-minute incantation that sounds like a lost </span><i>Songs of Leonard Cohen</i><span> cut but gradually accumulates an atmosphere of its own. When Olsen switches into ballad mode, she fares best with hushed, minimal arrangements. The echoing percussion and shimmering chords of “Dance Slow Decades” cloak the song in a relatively ill-fitting grandeur; the demo is probably more of a gut-punch. Same goes for the indistinct closer “Window”, which sounds a bit too much like someone trying to write a Feist song. Still, that last one feels like such an anomaly that it only underscores how distinct Olsen’s songwriting is across the rest of the record. </span><i>Burn Your Fire for No Witness</i><span> conjures the past without ever imitating it, swirling its influences into something intimate, impressionistic and new.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-73f4800b-2bf3-579c-b410-aae55d673976""> “I wish it were the same as it is in my mind,” Olsen laments in “Enemy”; this is pretty much the central conflict in every Angel Olsen song. The people she writes about daydream vividly, mumble reassuring mantras to themselves (""Some days all you need is one good thought strong in your mind""), and get so caught up in the songs stuck in their heads that they accidentally walk past their own houses. And yet, even as she longs for deep connections and hi-fives from strangers, Olsen knows too well that dreamers are usually loners. Not that she really minds. If she seems unafraid of—even superhumanly amped about—loneliness, it’s because her songs find an almost beatific peace in solitude. “If you can’t be psyched about your own thoughts,” she said <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9057-angel-olsen"">in an interview </a>a few years ago, “Then how are you supposed to have a meaningful interaction with anyone?” It’s a point she’s carried over into her music, honed in seclusion but now ready for more people to bear witness to its peculiar charms. </span></p></div>"|18956.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18956-angel-olsen-burn-your-fire-for-no-witness/|8.3|Lindsay Zoladz

His work as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"">the Field</a> is all bright gestures condensed into minimal shapes, executed with an adherence to repetition that's so single-minded it's hard not to wonder what listening to it over and over again during its conception must do to his brain. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32026-hands/"" target=""_blank"">Hands</a> is a new project from Willner that offers an escape from the lack of space in his music as the Field, if not from the ever-recurring patterns. It broadly fits into the plague-like spread of darker sounds across the electronic underground. If the Field is all vivid colors, Hands never makes it past monotone grey. Billed as a noise project, Hands actually has more in common with musicians taking subtle cues from noise and expanding them into other spaces, such as the night terrors of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/"">Demdike Stare</a> or the cloudier <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/l-i-e-s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">L.I.E.S.</a> material.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Something Willner revealed about this four-track release is that it was recorded before last year's Field album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18538-the-field-cupids-head/""><i>Cupid's Head</i></a>, which might explain that LP's tormented bent at times. Although nothing there gets as murky as <i>The Soul Is Quick</i>, where a bank of fog rolls in from the offset and only leaves in the dying minutes of the final track. Each composition here is an episodic offshoot of the title ""Beelitz-Heilstätten"", a Berlin sanatorium and tuberculosis clinic that counts Adolf Hitler among its most famous patients, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3522-rammstein/"">Rammstein</a> among clients seeking a suitably grim backdrop for filmed work. It's split into four parts, but the joins between ""Pt. 6"" and ""Pt. 7"" are barely perceptible, while the second pairing (""Pt. 10"" and ""Pt. 11"") offer only tiny forward motions throughout. Willner clearly likes going nowhere regardless of the form his music takes.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Much of the space created in the <i>The Soul Is Quick </i>feels tangible, resembling a place Willner has created to retreat into. When voices emerge toward the end of the final track it's both disturbing and startling, making it feel like there are others trapped down here with him, wandering amid his soupy drones. ""Hello? Hello?"" a panicked voice cries at one point, pitching it close to the helplessly lost vocal samples <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a> deploys on his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18820-burial-rival-dealer-ep/""><i>Rival Dealer</i></a> EP. It's an effective way of closing out the trail of loneliness that sluggishly routes through this music like a prisoner dragging a ball and chain across a dusty yard. Willner finds some kind of comfort in dead weight—on ""Pt. 6"" and ""Pt. 7"" the overall feel is one of being overcome, of things closing in around him. It's among the saddest music he's made, although there is a lighter touch at times, with ""Pt. 10"" gaining a lighter hue as it picks up a filmy rhythm a third of the way through.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-3a76c980-2b7f-096b-7605-04a244653978"">The softer, gentler tones that Willner brings into this music further distance it from the ""noise"" bracket Hands has mystifyingly been shunted into. When this collection of tracks begins it's more in line with the crestfallen leanings of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1524-flying-saucer-attack/"">Flying Saucer Attack</a>’s earlier work, in particular <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj_0ZGyBrYk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Oceans""</a> from <i>Distance</i>, which also triggers drones tinged with a strange duality, where beauty and thunder sit uneasily across the table from one another. For someone who doesn't change much, at least in his guise as the Field, there are strides being taken here, lending a sense of latent potential being fulfilled after years of being boxed into a much smaller corner. Nothing much happens in <i>The Soul Is Quick</i>—it's possible to wander in and out, picking up a thread you left dangling a few minutes before. That's where Willner excels, in creating these supple moments where you can get totally enveloped in what he's doing, or check out from the world for a while, or just leave him running in the background and marvel at how slowly he moves through time when your focus returns to him. </span></p></div>"|19030.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19030-hands-the-soul-is-quick/|6.8|Nick Neyland

A few songs later, she compares herself to <a href=""http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/255"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paul Verlaine</a>, the 19th-century French poet whose relationship with the teenage <a href=""http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/1268"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arthur Rimbaud</a> was notoriously violent. On another song, our heroine drinks herself to sleep while dreaming of an old lover and his talents between the sheets. Never leery of casting herself as the homewrecker, the other woman, or the spurned lover, Loveless writes lyrics that are frank (“I just like it so much better when we’re coming to blows”) and often explicit (“Don’t stop giving me head”). Her songs are based in country, but she tweaks the forms and formulas of the genre with a bleary belligerence that is, more often than not, directed at herself. Her self-destructive streak makes <i>Somewhere Else</i> both a bracing and a deeply harrowing listen.</p>
<p>Loveless hails from Columbus, Ohio, and she's so far the most visible member of a very musical family: Both sisters are in local groups, and before she had to fire him, her dad played drums in her backing band. After a slick debut and a more countrified follow-up on Bloodshot Records (which earned her a shout-out from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2052-richard-hell/"">Richard Hell</a>), <i>Somewhere Else</i> sounds like the lyrical and musical culmination of a short career spent kicking at the conventions of alt-country. The album takes more risks than its predecessors did, showcasing a rough-and-tumble bar-band sound that dispenses with the twang in favor of barbed guitars and rowdy rock rumble. Loveless and her band recall the West Coast cowpunk attitude of early 80s acts like Lone Justice, plus the sexual candor of heyday <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair/"">Liz Phair</a>.</p>
<p>Loveless’ frankness threatens to make a her a novelty, but there’s some sharp humor and deep hurt here. “When I was 17 I'd follow men around with my head jammed way in their ass,” she sings on “Chris Isaak”, and it sounds ridiculous. Fortunately the next line is, “Oh, what I wouldn’t give to still be able to conjure up energy like that”—which implies that making a wreck of your life is preferable to doing nothing at all with it. Even as <i>Somewhere Else</i> descends into romantic mania, Loveless keeps her wits about her. She sings “Head”, arguably the album’s best and most urgent track, as though her despair had turned sexual. Loveless storms into the chorus, turning the repeated lines into a potent hook and delivering an abrasive guitar solo that conveys what the lyrics cannot.</p>
<p>Perhaps Loveless knows she needs to find a better hero than Verlaine, who remains the epitome of tortured-soul creativity, yet on “Verlaine Shot Rimbaud” she craves the heady inspiration as much as the violent intensity of affection: “I just wanna know that I'm the one that makes you write that shit.” Halfway between French Romantic and Nashville outlaw, Loveless’ songwriting can come across sometimes as overly bleak and therefore sensationalistic, yet <i>Somewhere Else </i>makes such boldness a virtue, as thought decorum blunts creative expression. So it’s all the more curious that the album ends with an upbeat cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2627-kirsty-maccoll/"">Kirsty MacColl</a>’s postpunk/girl-group anthem “They Don’t Know”, a song about romance as a form of rebellion. Loveless doesn’t radically depart from the original, retaining the structure, tempo, tone, even the exclamation of “Baby!” halfway through. As a B-side or even a mid-album track, such a modest interpretation might be negligible, but after so many songs about tortured relationships and roiling regret, the song is almost triumphal as a closer, especially when Loveless testifies, “Now that I’ve found good love, I’m gonna make it last.” Then again, “They” might as well be “You,” as Loveless perhaps suspects her audience of tsk-tsking her love life. She doesn’t need your concern, just your ears. </p></div>"|18996.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18996-lydia-loveless-somewhere-else/|7.3|Stephen M. Deusner

In the time between 2002’s <i>One All </i>and the new <i>Dizzy Heights</i>, the New Zealander has released three <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5359-crowded-house/"">Crowded House</a> records, one Finn Brothers full-length, a record with Aussie singer-songwriter Paul Kelly, a Split Enz live album, and a collection of songs by his global side project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28305-7-worlds-collide/"">7 Worlds Collide</a>, which brought artists from all over the world (but mainly England and America) to New Zealand for a few informal sessions. Age has not, obviously, slowed him down, as Finn refuses to spend his 50s doling out event releases, intimate small-club tours, or—god forbid—more career retrospectives.</p>
<p>Also, <i>Dizzy Heights </i>is solo by default. He may get his name on the spine, but Neil is backed by a small army of Finns: His wife Sharon plays bass, while sons Liam and Elroy play guitar and drums. (Brother Tim, however, takes a breather this time around.) The abundance of family here is almost a corrective to the presence of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6743-dave-fridmann/"">Dave Fridmann</a>, a fine but occasionally overbearing producer whose imprint on <i>Dizzy Heights</i> is evident in the fuzzy low end of the title track, the tendrils of guitar that creep out of “Impressions”, and the percussive synths on “White Lies and Alibis”. At times he seems to be as much of a guiding personality as Finn himself—or at the very least a collaborator. But really, who’s keeping score? Rather than a blah album of retrospective singer-songwriter fare, which Finn has shown he can do in his sleep, <i>Dizzy Heights</i> is an album of sunny psychedelia and woozy pop grandeur.</p>
<p>Whether it’s the narcotized R&amp;B on opener “Impressions” or the cough-syrup showtunery of “Lights of New York”, the production gently coaxes the songs into new shapes, which makes this an ambitiously wide-ranging entry into Finn’s sprawling catalog. Sonically, the album strives to live up to its title, and its sequencing emphasizes vertiginous shifts in style and sound. Following the aerodynamic pace of “Flying in the Face of Love”, with its full-band sound and bass-forward groove, <i>Dizzy Heights </i>transitions into the darkly spare, deeply tense “Divebomber”, which nicely tweaks those aviation-themed lyrics. As the song lifts off, Finn’s only accompaniment is the sound of jet engines, a literal but effective manifestation of the song’s central metaphor. Musically, it recalls some of the sound collages <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a> assembled on <i>The Wall</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6308-the-final-cut/""><i>The Final Cut</i></a>, yet the song summons a strange and specific sense of foreboding even before Finn and Fridmann unleash the bombastic strings.</p>
<p>The emphasis here is clearly on sound over song, as Finn and Fridmann are more fascinated by texture than lyrics or even melodies. Often the vocals are buried deep within the production, another instrument in the family’s formidable arsenal. That’s not necessarily a complaint either. An exceptional melodist, Finn is not always a precise and exacting lyricist, and he addresses only hazy conceptions of “love” and “loss” throughout <i>Dizzy Heights</i>, dropping a few clunkers along the way. Possibly the worst: “C’mon, baby, I want your love to be/ based in real life, better than TV.” Or, maybe “I think Howard Hughes would love to be on the internet.” And yet, as a singer he’s a strange and compelling presence on this album, with a strong falsetto on “Recluse” and loose, off-the-cuff delivery on the title track. Finn sounds best when <i>Dizzy Heights</i> is at its dizziest, when he has to completely rethink how his voice fits a song. On the other hand, he sounds slightly less engaged on the more straightforward tunes, which perhaps don’t offer the same heady challenges. Either way, this is not the singer-songwriter album you’d expect from him at this stage in his career, for better or for worse.</p></div>"|19028.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19028-neil-finn-dizzy-heights/|6.9|Stephen M.

Though the multinational, UK-based quartet works within a very narrow stylistic range on <i>Cheatahs</i>, there’s no specific genre that defines it so much as a time frame. You know when you hear it, you heard it perfected sometime between 1990 and 1994 and it really hasn’t gone anywhere since. You’ll get lots of shoegaze, squalling indie rock and good ol’ alt-rock in various ratios, and every single sound on Cheatahs is taken from that span, with two exceptions: there’s a tiny riff throughout <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15085-cheetahs-fall/"">“Fall”</a> that’s a verbatim pull from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4581-wheat"">Wheat</a>’s “Breathe” or<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/""> Caribou</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QplxeexCcTE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Skunks""</a> and the coda on “The Swan” could pass for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2112-interpol/"">Interpol</a>’s “PDA"". Otherwise, if Cheatahs hadn’t ruined the illusion by performing live and everything, you could conceivably posit this record as an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25477-the-avalanches/"">Avalanches</a> sample collage that limited itself to a college radio station’s playlist during the bridge to the Clinton era.</p>
<p>Then again, any fan of kung fu movies or hamburgers know that novelty and invention aren’t required to make a genre exercise enjoyable. Yes, the guitars and Nathan Hewitt’s bedheaded vocals sit entirely within a Moore-Mascis-Shields triangulation, and the bass is almost never as loud as it could be. So Cheatahs distinguish themselves with mundane, crucial songwriting choices—play the oldies a little faster than you remember, throw in a melody you haven’t quite heard yet. The fundamentals of shoegaze facilitate the latter, as its predilection for altered tunings makes it easy to come across unusual chords and progressions. Meanwhile, the saturated distortion and slow-release vocals make these modulations much smoother than they’d otherwise be if played clean. And so it’s not the velocity of “Geographic” that makes it so instantly appealing, nor is it the volume, but rather the way it handles the curves.</p>
<p>Otherwise, <i>Cheatahs</i> derives its pleasures from recall that’s instantaneous, but not specific. There’s a trebly, ascending arpeggio on “Mission Creep” and you can’t quite place the exact <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3574-ride/"">Ride</a> song you heard it on, so hey, it’s like a new “old Ride” song! Ditto for the gelatinous chords on “Leave to Remain” that weren’t on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16605-isnt-anything-reissue-loveless-reissue-eps-1988-1991""><i>Isn’t Anything</i> or <i>Loveless</i></a>, maybe it was one of the EPs you missed out on. You know <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4017-swervedriver"">Swervedriver</a> were supposed to strap shoegaze ‘cross some engines, but if you never actually heard their music, then you can rest comfortably thinking “Get Tight” is probably what they sounded like.</p>
<p>Because we should be real here: if any of those names are unfamiliar to you, there’s a good chance you weren’t checking for Cheatahs in the first place. Along with parallel revivalists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31037-jagwar-ma/"">Jagwar Ma</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30983-eagulls"">Eagulls</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31483-temples"">Temples</a>, they’ve proven that conjuring a certain bygone, guitarcentric era of UK rock can be enough to make a debut “highly anticipated.” And by offering these small tweaks, they can still offer a real pleasure and a new way to experience this incredibly familiar music, sort of like your long-time partner deciding to use a slightly different kind of body soap.</p>
<p>Yet, knowing something that small could make a big difference, it’s disappointing to realize that Cheatahs barely try to make any sort of meaningful alteration to what came before. Most of their kind don’t either, but the best use shoegaze as a bridge or an off ramp. For example, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28604-yuck/"">Yuck</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15068-yuck"">debut</a> continues to gain stature for having successfully connected <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr"">Dinosaur Jr.</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4181-teenage-fanclub"">Teenage Fanclub</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith"">Elliott Smith</a>; that is not an easy task. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14929-ghost-blonde/""><i>Ghost Blonde</i>,</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29270-no-joy/"">No Joy</a> simply played louder than everyone else, and by last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17916-no-joy-wait-to-pleasure/""><i>Wait to Pleasure</i></a>, it merged Lush with Siouxsie, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteaus </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure"">the Cure</a>. There are many passages on <i>Cheatahs</i> resembling those of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29923-dive/"">DIIV</a>’s<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16749-oshin""> <i>Oshin</i></a>, which drove shoegaze backwards into post-punk and ambient.</p>
<p>Cheatahs allow you to namecheck the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4oCboj39jo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drop Nineteens</a> for the first time in at least a decade, but that’s about it. They’re hardly alone, as this style of music is about as puritanical as it gets—you don’t hear any bands cutting this sound with hip-hop or folk, nor has there ever been any explicitly political shoegaze band to my knowledge. It’s an ego-decimating genre that never really had much space for personality. Maybe Cheatahs are just confident that an enjoyable genre piece is more than enough or maybe you just want to get the sounds of <i>Loveless</i> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15069-nowhere-20th-anniversary-edition/""><i>Nowhere</i></a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11841-just-for-a-day-souvlaki-pygmalion""><i>Souvlaki</i></a> without having to acknowledge the baggage. And so, <i>Cheatahs</i> might not be a very ambitious record, but it is kinda ballsy.</p></div>"|18994.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18994-cheetahs-cheatahs/|6.5|Ian Cohen

Last year saw him release an EP on the Venice-based experimental label Morphine Records. <i>Adhesive</i>, a new four-track EP, once again finds Shofield crossing the pond, this time via Liberation Technologies, a Mute sub-label that to date has traded mostly in techno's darker arts, including a resurrecting Surgeon's long-running side project, British Murder Boys. Schofield's most realized work yet, <i>Adhesive</i>'s four tracks are simultaneously giddy and rotten, boggling techno's customary propulsion with lingering, heady rhythms and puzzling clamor.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Most purveyors of noisy machine music use the rhythm section to propel a song, with oversaturated bass drums and deteriorating snare cracks spurring the track forward, but also grounding it. Schofield's best pieces avoid this, relying on buoyant, tricky rhythms, albeit those built from the same sonic material as those of his peers. Most techno operates on a linear plane, pummeling forward at all costs; Schofield music hovers menacingly. The kick drum on ""Complex"" knocks around eighth notes in a pattern that most resembles krautrock's motorik rhythm. ""Slush"" offers its kicks in a hypnotic fury. The title track's double-time crash stirs up a lot of dust but doesn't actually go anyplace. This is techno re-imagined as a car unable to rev itself out of a snow bank: the total bafflement of violent, kinetic energy.</span></p>
<p>Schofield fills out his compositions with all manner of rhythmic noise, never settling on anything as gauche as a lead melody. Instead we're treated to ""Complex""'s hoary synthesizer pulse and ""Glaze""'s whinnying gashes of distortion. It's in these elements that Schofield's roots as a noise artist show. Nothing on <i>Adhesive</i> feels generative or truly random, but there's not a lot of organization either—storms of noise bristle against a brooding, muscular concentration of drums. ""Glaze"", especially, is a thrilling track whose thumping kick drums form something of a hook, requiring one of Schofield's finest little pots of chaos to distract your attention.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There's a playfulness to <i>Adhesive</i> that belies the nature of its sounds—still scraped-knee burn—and sets the EP apart from Schofield's previous work. <i>Adhesive</i> sounds more fully formed, less home-cooked than <i>LP</i>, and while that record's ragamuffin noise was part of its charm, Schofield is potent and mischievous enough to succeed even as he better understands what he's doing. There's plenty of clamor to be found here, but Schofield deploys it to disorient, not menace. Most techno is futuristic, or dystopian, or both; <i>Adhesive</i> is oddly present, content to bash around in its treehouse and happy that anyone might want to stop by.</span></p></div>"|19024.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19024-container-adhesive/|8.0|Andrew Gaerig

His atypical origin story doesn’t peg him as an outsider artist in the traditional sense—<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/willisearlbeal/sets/a-place-that-doesnt-exist"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>releasing an EP on your SoundCloud page</span></a> usually precludes one from being labeled an outsider artist—but more importantly Beal defines himself as an outsider through his hermetic music. Like, say, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/5849-jandek/"" target=""_blank"">Jandek</a>, Beal dislodges himself from culture, and stays unimpeded by form, fidelity, or trends. It is so far what has made every Beal record such a joy to listen to.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The joy from this free </span><i>A Place That Doesn’t Exist</i><span> EP isn’t always from the music on it—though there are some quite brilliant moments—but more so from the plot development in Beal’s career. The leap from busted lo-fi recordings on<i> </i></span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16454-acousmatic-sorcery/"">Acousmatic Sorcery</a></i><span> to having XL (Adele’s label) put out the well polished </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18460-willis-earl-beal-nobody-knows/"">Nobody knows.</a></i><span> was a whiplash move. This EP is not a full retraction of his major label sound, but Beal takes several deep breaths in order to make smaller music. The songs here rely less on bluesy moans to convey emotion.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Similarities between <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"">Tom Waits</a> and Beal are duly noted, but where Waits can come across like a charlatan narrator of the wacky carnival of life, Beal more often is a part of the carnival. Mythical beginnings notwithstanding, what draws people to Beal is how well he hawks his kind of anachronism. You almost believe that the intrusive record static found throughout the record was something Alan Lomax did his best to try to remove. Most of the songs on the EP feature a mid-fi Beal working firmly in the folk medium, giving the songs a macabre baroque feel to it. Think Bert Jansch if he always wore a cape and cowl. “Bright Copper Noon” is one of the first Beal compositions that benches his voice to a broken waltz thick with synths, but “Babble On” inverts the whole thing, and keeps the fingerpicked lounge-folk behind Beal’s double-tracked soul tenor.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>All the instrumentation and arrangements sound like they're clogging Beal’s id. There’s nothing quite so primal, so sexually explicit as ""Too Dry To Cry"" or as revealing as “Evening’s Kiss” so everything here comes out a bit heady and knock-kneed. This leads to new forms, like “The Axeman” a story about a tiny figurine that haunts Beal until he decides to set it on fire. The storytelling frame makes it more an exemplum of Beals’ demented nature, like a preacher moralizing about his own lost soul in a parable of what not to do if you think your toys are silently mocking you.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>No, Beal’s fringe side comes out directly on the antagonist “Toilet Parade (Ode To NYC)”, which, for its titular accuracy, is kind of a bummer in its faux performance art execution. The half-hour EP closes with two spoken-word performances, one tender (“Hazel Eyes”) and one very much not. The final track literally speaks to Beal's obsession with being a 21st century nowhere man. In a spirited monologue, with a cadence somewhere between a mystic sidewalk preacher and a character on campy sci-fi TV show, Beal describes the curled, uncanny objects in his world: heat rashes, floating red lights, skinflint pirate ladies. It all leads to the end, a condemnation of the academic industrial complex: “School is for me another useless, required step on the road to a place that does not exist.”</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-6c535440-2c07-bcc7-bcc9-80537382f3ef""><span>It’s exciting, though it certainly doesn’t jive with the nocturnal vibe of the rest of the album. Beal’s obsession with being “nobody” from “nowhere” isn’t a bid for anonymity and mysteriousness, it’s more an anxiety and separation from the world. Ironically, it's an anxiety stemming from not being on the outside. Is this angst a key to why he’s hiding behind more instrumentation, why his carnal growl is absent through the album? Is that why this latest offering is so mannered and scattered? There’s enough mystery baked in his songs he really doesn’t need the “outsider” label. And by the joy in plot development I mean that Beal, like the prolific Waits and Jandek before him, will hopefully be known more for the final shape of his trajectory as an artist. If the end path is as fascinating and demented as the individual mile markers, it’s all we can hope for.</span></span></p></div>"|18993.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18993-willis-earl-beal-a-place-that-doesnt-exist/|6.6|Jeremy D.

Band of Horses played a two-night stand there in April 2013, and their decision to unplug their electric guitars in favor of acoustic suggests a knowledge of the venue's long life as the home of country music. It's certainly an impressive name on the album cover, and definitely the most compelling aspect of this pallid set. Seemingly intended to legitimize the band's music—specifically, their two most recent albums of diminishing-returns bro rock—the venue conjures up a very specific musical legacy that Band of Horses simply cannot live up to.</div>
<p><i></i>The red-brick tabernacle on Fifth Avenue in Nashville was built in 1892, but it wasn’t known as the Ryman Auditorium until the 1900s, when it was renamed after a local businessman, saloon proprietor, and riverboat captain. It wasn’t known for country music, however, until 40 years later: The Grand Ole Opry radio show relocated to that space when it outgrew nearby War Memorial Auditorium. Broadcast hundreds of miles in every direction, the show became so popular that the Ryman was soon identified as the home of country music—or, as it is currently billed, the “mother church.” The country music industry, if not necessarily the music itself, eventually outgrew the venue, and in the early 1970s, the Opry moved to a theme park outside of Nashville, which held more fans in its megachurch-like auditorium. For two decades, the Ryman sat downtown empty and neglected, and was nearly torn down. Thanks to the efforts of local artists and fans—including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2045-emmylou-harris/"">Emmylou Harris</a>, who filmed a series of concerts there in the early 1990s—the building was refurbished and reopened as a concert hall and museum, its rustic ambience and wooden pews providing a stark contrast to the hermetic confines of Opryland.</p>
<p>Especially in a town that saw young hat acts displacing established artists, the Ryman became a local symbol of the industry’s neglect of its own legacy. In some ways, the venue is a sanctuary not unlike Preservation Hall in New Orleans or the Old Town School of Folk Music in Chicago, where certain ideals survive alongside the music. But its emphasis on country has broadened to include all types of what is now considered Americana and roots music. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7319-erasure/"">Erasure</a> both recorded concerts there in the 2000s, and the stage has hosted younger acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"">Coldplay</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28595-mumford-sons/"">Mumford &amp; Sons</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a>.</p>
<p>Recording an album at the Ryman—and branding the record as such—signals a certain populism that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6993-ben-bridwell/"">Ben Bridwell</a> and the band have embraced awkwardly over the last few years and albums. They didn’t “sell out,” necessarily, but by trying to puncture indie rock’s notorious insularity, they’ve shed the eccentricities that once defined and distinguished them. Nowadays they sound more <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5079-america/"">America</a> than Americana. Their reverence for the venue explains the acoustic set-up, which makes <i>Acoustic</i> a pretty wan live souvenir, alternately granola-crunchy and sappy-soggy. Aside from the rich sound of the room—which subtly mimics the vocal reverb Band of Horses was known for ca. 2006—there’s not much in the music that nods to the venue or screams “country music,” and that’s fine. Preferable even, as who wants to hear Band of Horses play “Ring of Fire”? But the Ryman—or at least the <i>idea</i> of the Ryman—does reinforce the self-seriousness of Bridwell’s songwriting, which means lyrics of “Factory” and “Slow Cruel Hands of Time” sound even hokier here than they did on the studio albums. Worst is (still) “Neighbor”, which is sort of <a href=""http://youtu.be/mQ4KzClb1C4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Room</i></a> of folk rock songs. But at least Tommy Wiseau never endorsed hackeysack anarchy or wrote a line like “Now if Bartles &amp; Jaymes didn’t need no first names/ We could live by our own laws in favor.” Sung a cappella at the Ryman, it all sounds so much more ridiculous.</p>
<p><i>Acoustic </i>has all the ponderousness of a forgotten episode of <i>MTV Unplugged,</i> and that setting only highlights Band of Horses’ worst tendencies. “Slow Cruel Hands of Time” and “Detlef Schrempf” sound ambitiously dour, the heavy mood sucking all the air out of the songs. “Wicked Gil”, an upbeat number from <i>Everything All the Time</i>, gets slowed down to a shambling pace that replaces its urgent hook and tangle of guitars with a kind of aw-shucks resignation: “I know evil people will say things,” Bridwell sings like he’s throwing up his hands. On the other hand, more recent songs like “Slow Cruel Hands” and “Factory” were downbeat to begin with, so they just sound redundant in this setting. And if you’ve ever wondered what “The Funeral” might sound like hunted-and-pecked on a piano, you’re in luck, I guess.</p>
<p><i>Acoustic</i> sounds like the culmination of a H.O.R.D.E.-ward trajectory Band of Horses have been tracing since their second release: beefing up their sound, abandoning the outsize moments that distinguished their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1200-everything-all-the-time/"">debut</a>, yet maintaining that same I-love-you-man rock romanticism. It’s either the most depressing career arc or the greatest indie-rock trolling of the twenty-first century. Coming at the nadir of that trajectory, <i>Acoustic</i> sounds shot through with a weird desperation, or perhaps a hope that the venue will lend these songs some gravity and legitimacy. It doesn’t. It can’t. On this live album, the Ryman is just a room with good acoustics. </p></div>"|18938.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18938-band-of-horses-acoustic-at-the-ryman/|3.6|Stephen M. Deusner

But in 2014, the simplest messages are often the most urgent ones. Western media coverage of the Sochi Oympics has brought attention to Russian anti-gay violence and legislation. But we're also sharing a planet with at least five countries where even vaguely defined homosexual behavior is worthy of the death penalty. Jam Rostron, the multimedia artist behind Planningtorock, sings ""You can't illegalize love"" on the title track on <i>All Love's Legal</i>. That slogan could fit on a t-shirt, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Nuance isn't translating so well today.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Rostron's musical work, a kind of art-house house, has always been a smart platform for direct intentions. Her debut album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9237-have-it-all/"" target=""_blank""><i>Have It All</i></a> laid down the small set of tools—violin, keyboards, drum machine, heavily processed vocals—that she would also use on her followup <i>W</i>. Setting aside Rostron's collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13974-tomorrow-in-a-year/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tomorrow, in a Year</i></a>, she's only gotten better at the balance. On <i>All Love's Legal</i> she refines further, adding or subtracting beats and strings until finding the right tension between her unambiguous gender politics and her unknowable voice.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite the sparse instrumentation and arrangement, Rostron's songs evoke huge, cavernous spaces. By manipulating the attack and echo on her strings and synths, she creates the clouds of theatrical fog that cling to the melody on ""Human Drama"". You can hear the empty stage surrounding her. The bass and drums songs, like ""Misogyny Drop Dead"" and ""All Love's Legal"", drift out of sync, tugging at each other and galloping separately. Even the most straightforward dance track, the irresistibly in-sync ""Let’s Talk About Gender Baby"", feels off, but in a good way. Rostron repeats the titular phrase over her usual brooding bass line, but she extends the syllables a little too long, slurring her words on either the world's most self-aware dancefloor or your college's drunkest women's studies discussion section.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Even artists that resist sex and gender classification will adopt genre conventions when making their music. Putting aside the creator, the lyrics, or even the voice, there's something that seems unidentifiable in <i>All Love's Legal</i>. The instrumentation is neither pretty nor ugly, human or not human, masculine nor feminine. Rather than trading on identification (""I'm just like you, you're just like me!""), Rostron opts for alienation. It's a bold strategy—the impersonality of the music prohibits anyone from rejecting the message and accepting the messenger. There's no distinction between the two.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>All Love's Legal</i> isn't as bleak as all that, though. There's an organic, humanistic ethos operating behind her music: we are all people, and we're all moved by the same primal passions and stimuli. Planningtorock as a multimedia project is committed to pushing that idea as far as it can go. It's undanceable dance music sung by an arid, semi-digitized voice. It asks you to abandon the kind of categorical thinking that divides man from woman and gay from straight. This sounds like the kind of message that pop music has come to embrace. But rather than deliver that message in an instantly metabolized treacle-pop ballad or an arena-ready club anthem, Rostron's music demands that you confront what abandoning deeply-entrenched ways of thinking about gender and desire would actually feel like—it doesn't sound too comfortable, and it shouldn't. (This is, by the way, the ocean that separates ""Same Love"" from Planningtorock's ""Public Love"".) Gender may be a ""lie,"" as Rostron sings on ""Human Drama"", but it's a lie that, for most people, rests at the core of our sense of self. So if we're truly going to come together, Rostron seems to say, we're going to have to come undone first.</p></div>"|18990.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18990-planningtorock-all-loves-legal/|7.5|Jessica Suarez

But at the mention of the curious French chanteuse (as well as novelist, actress, playwright, and poet) Brigitte Fontaine and her decades-long musical collaboration with Kabyle musician Areski Belkacem, he noticeably brightened. That Hansen was a fan of the singular musical vision enacted by Fontaine and Belkacem was obvious, and in terms of 90s alt-rock icons, he was not alone: Fontaine’s oeuvre was a touchstone for the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth</a> (Fontaine’s vocal affect and influence can clearly be heard in Kim Gordon’s songs), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"" target=""_blank"">Björk</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4769-jarvis-cocker/"" target=""_blank"">Jarvis Cocker</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"" target=""_blank"">Stereolab</a>, to name but a few.</p>
<p>And yet only with these recent reissues of Fontaine’s groundbreaking third and fourth albums—1968’s <i>Est…Folle</i> and 1971’s <i>Comme à La Radio</i>—is her music domestically available in the US. By the time Fontaine made her recorded debut in 1965<i>,</i> she was already a published playwright and actress, appearing on numerous Parisian stages. Nearly 30 years of age by the time of the release of her breakout third album, Fontaine was a world away from French pop music’s stables of Yé-Yé girls, hewing slightly closer to the brooding chanson of Jacques Brel. Drawing on her experimental theatrical background, she began penning songs that abandoned standard pop rhyme schemes, using her artful pacing and a form of spoken word delivery that put her earthy, Marlene Dietrich intonation to the most effective use.</p>
<p>Within an album or two, Fontaine would be deep in avant-garde jazz and nascent world music hybrids, so in hindsight <i>Est…Folle</i> sounds the most traditional, even though it’s nothing of the sort—in fact, the title translates to “Brigitte Fontaine is crazy” and its cover features Fontaine’s striking dark eyes emanating from a big white question mark. Recorded in the studio with composer/arranger Jean-Claude Vannier—who would soon add orchestral heft to France’s greatest rock export, Serge Gainsbourg’s <i>Histoire de Melody Nelson</i>—<i>Est…Folle</i> is playful and charming, even if it offers few hints at the curveballs ahead.</p>
<p>Opener “Il Pleut” finds Fontaine in the most opulent orchestrations of her career, sounding like a precursor to Melody Nelson, Vannier applying garlands of strings and metallophones as a tympanum keeps the beat. “Le Beau Cancer” could be a jaunty number from the stage while “Je Suis Inadaptée” finds Fontaine's sultry voice sparring with woodwinds. Elsewhere, “Comme Rimbaud” speeds along on a peppy backbeat and frantic tambourines. The 11 songs that comprise <i>Folle</i> move with alacrity, with only two lasting longer than 3:30. Were it the lone album Fontaine ever recorded, it would be one of French pop’s more curious statements.</p>
<p>But as she began to work closer with proto-freak-folk/songwriter Jacques Higelin (he wrote one of <i>Est…Folle</i>’s songs) and her soon-to-be lifelong collaborator Areski Belkacem, her music mutated into something stranger and more wondrous. <i>Comme à la Radio</i> stems from the musical/theatrical works the three undertook at the end of the 1960s, where Fontaine’s husky spoken verses went atop spare and propulsive rhythms that drew on folk and Arabic and African instrumentation. The album’s coup comes in the form of Brigitte Fontaine and Areski bringing in the fiercely defiant jazz group the Art Ensemble of Chicago, who had decamped to Paris for a few years.</p>
<p>From the opening notes of that muscular walking bassline provided by Malachi Favors, the title track is a startling hybrid of avant-garde sensibilities—both of the free jazz and French rock variety—that entrances rather than excludes. The Art Ensemble could abstract and abandon structures with the best of American jazz ensembles of the late 60s, but here they play in the pocket to mesmerizing effect, from the lyrical horn lines provided by the frontline of Joseph Jarman, Roscoe Mitchell, and Leo Smith to the throbbing undertow provided by Favors and Belkacem, the rhythms foregrounded, the brass weaving in and around Fontaine’s seductive spoken lines for eight snake-charming minutes.</p>
<p>Or rather, her words only sound seductive to non-Francophone speakers, for Fontaine’s lyrics for “Comme à la Radio” comment on that acute sense of alienation and horror in the modern world, with lines about thousands weeping, police beating a young man, an alcoholic doctor, repeating a line that translates as “It’s cold in the world” in a whisper that sends shivers. Throughout the album, the Art Ensemble and Areski deploy hand percussion, bowed bass, bouzouki, shenai, sitar, lute, and muted brass to suggest Bedouin caravans, African tribal music, sub-Saharan buzzing, all of it beguiling and mysterious, feeling at once as if sounding from a great distance and via Fontaine’s hushed delivery, intimate.</p>
<p>The numbers featuring the Art Ensemble’s contributions remain some of free jazz’s most evocative crossovers, but what makes <i>Comme a la Radio</i> one of the era’s most striking documents is that even without the jazz musician guests, it’s a haunting acid-folk album underneath the brass. The album’s most stunning moments come when Areski handles all of the music around Fontaine’s vocals. There’s the ghostly shenai and bouzouki adding an exotic cast to the fragile incant of “L'Été L'Été”, or the strange strings on the harrowing album closer, “Lettre A Monsieur Le Chef De Gare De La Tour De Carol”, the sawed strings and buzzing drones—urged faster and faster by the hand drums and wordless vocals of Areski—build to a hypnotic and feverish climax. Both “Lettre” and the bonus track “Le Noir C'Est Mieux Choisi” remain some of the most beatific dark folk songs ever recorded, regardless of language.</p></div>"|19022.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19022-brigitte-fontaine-estfolle-comme-a-la-radio/|7.3|Andy Beta

<p>Or rather, her words only sound seductive to non-Francophone speakers, for Fontaine’s lyrics for “Comme à la Radio” comment on that acute sense of alienation and horror in the modern world, with lines about thousands weeping, police beating a young man, an alcoholic doctor, repeating a line that translates as “It’s cold in the world” in a whisper that sends shivers. Throughout the album, the Art Ensemble and Areski deploy hand percussion, bowed bass, bouzouki, shenai, sitar, lute, and muted brass to suggest Bedouin caravans, African tribal music, sub-Saharan buzzing, all of it beguiling and mysterious, feeling at once as if sounding from a great distance and via Fontaine’s hushed delivery, intimate.</p>
<p>The numbers featuring the Art Ensemble’s contributions remain some of free jazz’s most evocative crossovers, but what makes <i>Comme a la Radio</i> one of the era’s most striking documents is that even without the jazz musician guests, it’s a haunting acid-folk album underneath the brass. The album’s most stunning moments come when Areski handles all of the music around Fontaine’s vocals. There’s the ghostly shenai and bouzouki adding an exotic cast to the fragile incant of “L'Été L'Été”, or the strange strings on the harrowing album closer, “Lettre A Monsieur Le Chef De Gare De La Tour De Carol”, the sawed strings and buzzing drones—urged faster and faster by the hand drums and wordless vocals of Areski—build to a hypnotic and feverish climax. Both “Lettre” and the bonus track “Le Noir C'Est Mieux Choisi” remain some of the most beatific dark folk songs ever recorded, regardless of language.</p></div>"|19022.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19022-brigitte-fontaine-estfolle-comme-a-la-radio/|8.7|Andy Beta

Since they already feel like a modern iteration of the Dungeon Family approach that has seeped into the second-generation Cali gangsta, finding an inverse in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31721-isaiah-rashad/"" target=""_blank"">Isaiah Rashad</a> makes perfect sense. He's an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3199-outkast/"" target=""_blank"">OutKast</a> fan from the South who's also comfortable in the context of a West Coast that gave us <i>Labcabincalifornia </i>and <i>Me Against the World </i>the same year. While his BET Hip Hop Awards Cypher appearance last year was a bit of an advance notice, the abrupt arrival of his voice in full proves at least one thing: Top Dawg has scouts that'd make Billy Beane lose his damn mind.</p>
<p>Rashad's background draws from a few different sources. While he rode around Chattanooga bumping No Limit classics through the speakers of the '95 Civic he nicknamed “Cilvia”, he did so knowing that the real scene and all the networking opportunities to advance were some 120 miles down I-75 to Atlanta. His style wound up developing with the outside influence of already known artists, but laced with the personal, true-to-self approach that typically comes from having to impress peers and friends instead of a scene wracked with hypebeasts. And with the development that comes when your subject matter demands introspection from the get-go, <i>Cilvia Demo </i>is as much a revelation as labelmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s breakthrough <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15653-section80/"" target=""_blank"">Section.80</a>—</i>only this time, there's also a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17253-good-kid-maad-city/"" target=""_blank""><i>good kid, m.A.A.d city </i></a>to look up at and aspire to.</p>
<p>That may come in time, maybe sooner than we think; <i>Cilvia Demo </i>already shows an MC who isn't afraid to lay every anxiety and frustration bare and winds up looking stronger for it. There isn't a clear delineation between Rashad's moments of struggle and his times of strength—these are songs where one typically tests the other, where Hennessey and Jagermeister are less the celebratory ingredients of VIP sections than the coping mechanisms for figuring shit out. Few lines seperate the verse-starting come-on “Baby, can you sucky on my dick/ I know it's big enough” and the admission “I done grown up for my child sake” in “Webbie Flow (U Like),"" a song where his swagger and his responsibilities get tangled up in his own self-recognition. The vivid despair of “Heavenly Father"", where the one point of hope in a litany of suicidal thoughts and dead-end burnout is the question of “If I give my story to the world/ I wonder if they'd book me for a show,” still persists in the mind when a tribute to the similarly introspective Scarface, “Brad Jordan"",  has him spitting the rhetoric of invincibility. And there's a line on the title track where he worries about having his own kid look at him the same way he looked at his deadbeat dad; it hits even harder once you've taken in the lyrics about his own feelings about his father. It should all be instantly familiar to anyone dealing with “I'm 21, now what” introspection (or memories thereof).</p>
<p>His headspace comes through so strongly you could easily overlook that Rashad can also put together some fucking <i>verses</i>. There's a single line in the title track that could sum up why his lyrics sink in so deep—“<i>'93 Til </i>be cool for Emmett”—that packs the thematic merging of South and West, racist trauma and artistic resilience, oppressive violence and expressive freedom, all in six words. He can rattle off dense internals with double-meaning followups (“Soliloquy”'s line “Leave the bodies on the cul-de-sac, follow me the cult is back” opens the door for a Jim Jones meta-reference), he's got his share of punchlines (a pistol in “Menthol” “knock caps like it's senior year”), his hooks draw blood (“Tranquility for a Brutus/ And hard road for a Caesar”), and he mixes personal details and pop-culture namedrops so naturally that even his Vince Vaughn and Larry David shout-outs seem like matter-of-fact acknowledgements than celebrity punchlines.</p>
<p>As for his voice, Rashad's prone to conjuring up influences in a way that makes part of his stylistic blueprint clear. Along with the aforementioned Scarface shout-out, “West Savannah” makes the OutKast connection implicit; same for “R.I.P. Kevin Miller” and Master P. Throw in how he first started modeling his flow off a young Lil Wayne, and that's the base for a strong Southern itinerary that he's managed to make his own. He's turned those reference points into something more slippery and reflective, and whether his clear, subtly needling, percussive drawl is hyped up or worn down, he rides the beat with a sharp sense of timing. There are some occasional deliberate hitches in his flow that play up the unmediated, conversational yet still beat-driven cadence of his voice to an extent that it's hard to even break it down into component parts. It just is, and it can't and shouldn't be anything else.</p>
<p>At least a little of that could be the production talking, granted: the slate of beats on <i>Cilvia Demo </i>unites into a consistently immersive, complete album package that's just as ruminative as the lyrics.<i> </i>It draws from a downtempo vibe that swaps out Southern hip-hop's deep soul for <i>noir</i> jazz while retaining that certain cruising-speed dream-state glide. Post-Dirty South in the same way that previous TDE high points have been post-g-funk—indebted but transcendent—there's a consistent thread of deep, often heavily reverbed pianos and brittle yet steady off-kilter snares that make up for the South being the only American hip-hop region to never really give that whole Soulquarian thing a shot. That it pulls it off with a 10-producer committee full of relative unknowns is worth noting. Half of them have <i>Cilvia Demo </i>as their only Discogs credit, but their work stands out: Ross Vega's muted, melting-organ and screw-drum-lope opener “Hereditary”; Joseph Stranger's glow-bass 98 Dilla minimalism for the title cut; a grip of ethereal ghost-church beats by the Antydote (“Ronnie Drake”; “West Savannah”; “Banana”) that make him almost as much of a blindside breakout as the headliner.</p>
<p><i>Cilvia Demo </i>ends with a remix of “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16074-shot-u-down/"" target=""_blank"">Shot U Down</a>"", the name-maker that dropped last fall and remains the definitive moment of Rashad's career in a sort of “first result in Google autocomplete” kind of way. First single, last track—it's a fitting place for both, initially placing Rashad in an introductory context back in September and now, on this album, feeling like the culmination of a debut full-length that could go down as the best all year. The remix features some TDE co-signs in the form of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30639-jay-rock/"" target=""_parent"">Jay Rock</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30134-schoolboy-q/"" target=""_blank"">ScHoolboy Q</a>, who contribute strong verses in embattled gangsta/money hustler mode, respectively. They're a welcome connection to Rashad's new place in hip-hop, but they're also added attractions rather than skeptic-comforting legitimizers. Rashad's already the real thing, even if his strengths lie in coming to terms with how to turn that real thing into a righteous thing. Now that he's arrived, watching him hit his next destination's going to be exhilarating.</p></div>"|19014.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19014-isaiah-rashad-cilvia/|8.2|Nate Patrin

And Persson’s two albums as A Camp—the first with the late Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse and the second with husband Nathan Larson—were solo in everything but the name. While the Cardigans were never all about Persson, she was the major draw; she got pegged as a heroine of coldhearted warm pop: summery melodies whose sun rays just might skewer anyone who basks. She's won countless devotees, from the wordy-sweet Swedish indie acts for whom the Cardigans are canon to those who knew the band from soft-rock radio and <i>Romeo + Juliet.</i> Entire swaths of music are cut from Persson’s cloth; she is a known quantity.</p>
<p>For better or worse, this lets Persson get away with an album like <i>Animal Heart</i>, one<i> </i>that isn’t much of a statement. She has so many strengths to coast on. Her voice still frays so beguilingly well at the end of a phrase. She still has a way with production filigrees, with letting a bridge dissolve into dreamy guitar licks or tucking a watch-this sparkle beneath a verse and then a cruel barb beneath the line. And she still knows how to write a great chorus. The title track here stands among her best, a gorgeous continuous springtime melt of an indie-pop song with a subtle, urgent energy. It’s the most straightforward pleasure on an album more concerned with Persson’s tricksy songwriting. “Catch Me Crying” is like a torch song illuminated by firefly lights and surprisingly busy: over-keeled melodies, over-anxious percussion and synths, over-ragged vocals, and far too much repetition for “you’ll never catch me crying for you—again” to read as anything but ironic. “Forgot to Tell You” is the same tack from the opposite approach: a Sunday kind of breakup song, pleasant like an afternoon on the porch; everything’s so nice-nice, you hardly notice she’s shrugged the poor guy off with “so I might just forget about you now” then slunk away with a smile.</p>
<p>But with so many midtempo tracks so removed from the glam of, say, <i>Super Extra Gravity </i>or <i>Gran Turismo</i>, everything inevitably blurs together. Even at the track level Persson doesn’t quite manage the balance. The concept doesn’t help, as she only half-commits to the metaphor suggested by the record's title. “Food for the Beast” has a commanding chorus (even if it’s constantly one skank away from becoming <a href=""http://freakytrigger.co.uk/popular/2012/04/ace-of-base-all-that-she-wants/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Swedish reggae</a>), but it’s pretty clearly a retread of the title idea. Beyond that are fish and bird metaphors seemingly there just to get Persson out of class Mammalia, and “Jungle” is a nadir: tinny and terrible like a demo recording from whichever machine spat out <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTQbiNvZqaY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Toto</a> songs in the 1980s. One wonders why she even needed the concept at all. It’s baby-songwriter stuff from an artist who’s better off mature.</p>
<p>“Mature” can be code for “acoustic”, and while nothing on <i>Animal Heart </i>is quite like A Camp at its faux-Americana twangiest, the remnants of that sound remain strong. “The Grand Destruction Game” has fun with its confessional tropes and stock lovers—wayward sailors and elegant gangsters and other men who mainly exist in folk songs share headspace with “the cross-eyed lead singer of a bad boy band.” The hymn-like “Burning Bridges for Fuel” simmers with an exhausted resilience that’s sequenced far too early. The title of “This Is Heavy Metal,” sounds like a joke; thankfully, it’s neither a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7tSUuTF_hY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lordi cover</a> nor particularly ironic, but in instead a wry piano ballad whose singer the parade has passed by. Persson drowses through auburn piano chords and wry lines: “I would like to sell now/ My life is going well now/ My bones are at an all-time OK,” could be the lonely final scene to a both-ends-ablaze Cardigans single. It’s mesmerizing, the sort of thing you want to hear albums more of; it also sounds utterly resigned, as a song if not a career statement. If there’s an upshot, Persson’s a good enough writer to compose herself another act.</p></div>"|18986.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18986-nina-persson-animal-heart/|5.5|Katherine St. Asaph

The drums canter in, and the band clips along amicably enough—that is, at least, until they race temporarily into bursts of irascible distortion and screams. Helms Alee backs out, but only to rush in again. This back-and-forth continues across the song’s full three minutes. Bass builds and disappears. Guitars lash and abate. Momentum flashes and fades. It's also a multivalent thrill ride, where the song twists not only through parts but also turn through varied styles—a touch of stoner metal in the tumescent bass, of math-rock in the latticework guitar, of hardcore in the clinched vocals, of girl-group pop in the supporting harmonies. The song swivels so much that you can imagine the band drawing blueprints to build it. But the complexity does not limit the tune’s impact or approachability, making it a new feat of communion for Helms Alee.</p>
<p>Helms Alee spent more than three years writing parts and songs for what became <i>Sleepwalking Sailors</i>, meaning that they were at work on it before <i>Weatherhead</i> arrived in the summer of 2011. That makes sense, as <i>Weatherhead</i>, even more than Helms Alee’s 2008 debut, suggests a potpourri of unsettled ideas. There is bracing post-hardcore and primeval indie rock, soporific drift and phosphorescent post-rock. All of those elements weren’t split into songs of their own so much as crammed into the same space, like strangers compelled into roommate status. On those first two records, Helms Alee felt like an intriguing collective caught up in a particular post-everything moment, more focused on the possibilities than the power of what they were making.</p>
<p>You can still find the seams throughout <i>Sleepwalking Sailors</i>, their most aggressive but accessible album yet. Helms Alee doesn’t slough any of its previous interests wholesale, and each aspect of their musical personality is too distinct to camouflage with the rest. But the seams now crisscross in brilliantly unsuspected patterns, giving each element its space and the benefit of contrast. In spite of its moribund name, “Fetus.Carcass” starts rather softly, with Hozoji Matheson-Margullis’ Siouxsie Sioux-like coo stretched over a heavy rhythmic lumber. Twice during the song, though, Verellen barks over an italicized onslaught, a menacing shock spliced into the surgical reverie. The shifts are jarring, yes, but they fit well, presaged by ruptures in the meter and slowly evolving transitions. “Dangling Modifiers” is a delight of stylistic tension, revealed in a rather novel fashion. For most of the song, the band locks into one cycle, with a series of staccato guitar notes expertly wound between Matheson-Margullis’ ever-roiling drums. The pattern shifts slightly, but even toward the end, when the drums slow and the guitars smear, the variation on the song’s only musical theme is clear. But the trio, though, seesaws between Verellen’s hoarse, doom-ready roar, and his best approximation of perfectly droll indie rock. The male-female antiphony of “Crystal Gale” hints at a Breeders outtake, especially when there’s only a simply strummed electric guitar supporting the harmonies. But when an enormous bass bleed delivers reinforcement, the band’s basic interests in heaviness and catchiness align for a minute of wonderful clarity. If that sort of seemingly unforced synthesis was the goal of Helms Alee’s first two records, <i>Sleepwalking Sailors </i>finally fulfills the ambition.  </p>
<p>Halfway into “Pleasure Center”, during one of those accelerated moments, Verellen lets out the mightiest scream of the album. In real-time, it sounds like a tantrum—you know, a metal dude, snapping some metal-dude thing. But listen again and maybe again, and you’ll notice that he actually yells, “I want my MTV,” however disassembled the syllables may be. That playful feint encapsulates what’s best about Helms Alee on <i>Sleepwalking Sailors</i>: They cram a lot of unexpected assets into rather short songs, but that density no longer feels uncertain and unfocused. Not unlike SubRosa on last year’s <i>More Constant Than The Gods</i> or even Torche at their best,<i> </i>they’ve learned to combine their influences while largely hiding the effort required. That is, you first notice the thrill of the rollercoaster and only later pause to contemplate its mechanics. </p></div>"|18857.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18857-helms-alee-sleepwalking-sailors/|7.8|Grayson Haver Currin

This lies not in the riffs, but how they're presented.</span> They don't have the street vibe of Helmet or Prong, they're not interested in a Melvinsian sense of humor, and they're not imbued with Matt Pike's stoned majesty. Moreover, they sure as hell know they're not from Louisiana. Mantar have a seriousness about them, as evidenced on their debut album <i>Death By Burning</i>, cloaking their sounds in a darkness that make them downright vicious. They're a band who can claim the Jesus Lizard as an influence and still hang with the rosters of staunch metalists like Iron Bonehead or Hells Headbangers.</p>
<p>Mantar waste no time establishing their intent with lead-off cut “Spit”, going through chunky riffs that dance with a joker's mischievous, malevolent grin, and drums guided by Occam's Razor. You think it might fade out around 3:30, but not long after, guitarist Hanno Klänhardt and drummer Erinc Sakarya flex their muscles once again just to reiterate that they're not lighthearted about this endeavor. From mid-paced wrangles to doomy stops, nothing in this song feels wasted. Mantar picks up the pace on “Swinging the Eclipse” and “The Huntsmen” where they show off their tongue-lashing, hold-yer-axe-like-an-axe swagger. Even though this music sounds best in a narrow room, those songs hint at a band wanting to fill rooms as big as their ambitions.“White Nights” begins with Klänhardt exploring the lowest drones on his guitar, before going off into a Norwegian Second Wave tremolo jam. On <i>Burning</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> as a whole, but especially here,</span> they bridge the gap between the mystical themes of the 80s underground and the back-to-Sabbath movement of the 90s.</p>
<p>Klänhardt's vocals are what really separates Mantar from the earlier bands they're pulling from. He's got a strained scream, not unlike Mike Williams giving it a go for a black metal band, that lends feeling to his anger—you don't necessarily need to deduce what he's saying. Melded with the sly catchiness of the riffs, Mantar offer a solution for listeners bored with conventional boogie doom, and who want some plod with a little <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18518-in-solitude-sister/"">In Solitude allure</a>.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Mantar may not share the Melvins' penchant for absurdity, but the similarities between them go beyond riffs. Klänhardt and Sakarya aren't quite kindred spirits like Buzz Osborne and Dale Crover, but they've already got the makings for a fruitful partnership. <i>Burning</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is just the second item in their discography, following a  7” the band released themselves last year. The duo play as if they've known each other their whole lives, proving that chemistry can never be forced. Melvins fans joke about the band's constant rotation of bassists, even moreso in the light of the recent passing of Shirley Temple (her daughter Lori Black played with the Melvins in the late 80s and early 90s, mostly notably on 1991's </span><i>Bullhead</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">), but Mantar provides a vision of what would happen if Osborne and Crover ditched having a bassist altogether. Better yet, it suggests the possibility of Osborne absorbing Joe Preston and assimilating his low-end mastery. Just look at </span><i>Burning</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">'s closing track, “March of the Crows”, which begins with a guitar drift not unlike “Hung Bunny” from 1992's </span><i>Lysol</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, arguably the heaviest album in the Melvins' discography. Mantar shows a lot of promise in the short time they've been together, and truth be told, their heros will have to retire one day. Might as well look for a successor now—those estate battles get messy.</span></p></div>"|18992.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18992-mantar-death-by-burning/|7.4|Andy O'Connor

Who hasn't looked over a shelf full of fascinating books only to hear the owner hold forth on some misguided personal philosophy? If something looks refined, it can be difficult not to admire it, which is why, on the surface, <a href=""http://lo-fang.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lo-Fang</a> seems like such a promising project.</p>
<p>It's got all the right elements to be perfectly tasteful and even a little bit profound: For his debut mixtape-turned-album, <i>Blue Film</i>, classically trained musician Matthew Hemerlein spent several itinerant years in places like Cambodia, Bali, and his parents' home in Maryland writing songs inspired by his wandering. He plays every instrument on the album himself, and, in interviews, <a href=""http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/lo-fang-interview-playlist"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he talks about writing songs on different instruments</a> with the casual ease of someone who really knows what he's doing when he switches from cello to piano. His music unfolds slowly and seriously, punctuated with dramatic swells of violins and precise bass drum rumbles. It is immaculately well-produced. Plus, Hemerlein himself has the tousled good looks we all want from our hip violinists, and he's presented with the kind of lightly surreal visual imagery and swirls of color that helps us code things as deep and smart.</p>
<p>There's no question that Lo-Fang is in many ways arresting, and it's apparent as to why he's quickly gathered attention, as well as opportunities like getting chosen to open on tour for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31696-lorde/"" target=""_blank"">Lorde</a> this spring. Hemerlein is clearly talented, and his music is full of intriguing, subtle touches of craftsmanship. The low, droning synthesizers that back “Blue Film” or the deft synthetic-analog banjo interplay that opens “Permutations” are the kinds of details that can, in many cases, elevate an album from good to great. He even lands on a few moments of genuine pop catchiness, like the jaunty, taut refrain of “tear it down/ Nothing matters” on early single “#88”. But for all his technical skill and the excellent presentation of his music as the kind of thing that has substance, he doesn't really seem to have much to say or any particular aptitude for getting it across.</p>
<p>Lyrically, Lo-Fang songs range from almost embarrassingly inert to annoyingly overwrought to frustratingly tone deaf. The themes they cover are intro creative writing class material: confronting the tension between having a sex drive and being a thoughtful person, searching for meaning in jealousy about an ex, being inspired by stuff in life. “I look to the stars and I look to the sea and I look to the faces on the street,” Hemerlein sings on “Permutations”, establishing, well, not much. Opening track “Look Away” is undeniably pretty, but it gets derailed by clunky lyrics like “I never figured out how to/ Unfold your paper cranes/ Origami agony.” Elsewhere, “#88” drifts into sincere <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"" target=""_blank"">Sufjan Stevens</a> cadence to deliver the awkward metaphor of “An idea growing quietly from something within/ Spreads quicker than the cancer that destroyed your mother's skin.”</p>
<p>These moments would be understandable if there was some sense that the songs were taking any sort of emotional risk. But the stakes never feel that high, particularly given Hemerlein's uniformly breathy and slow delivery, a pretty but bored monotone that seems mostly suited for the emotional torment of staring out the window and sighing a lot. While the instrumentation is rich and carefully presented, it rarely generates much in the way of tension or energy, mostly sticking to a type of plodding, fussy minimalism that matches the ho-hum songwriting. Uncertainty and ambiguity can be powerful places to make art from, but here they are the end game, essentially stand-ins for a lack of coherent viewpoint.</p>
<p>These weaknesses are most apparent on the album's two covers, which seem to exist to underscore the aimlessness of the project. <a href=""http://youtu.be/aataTbxlWeM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“You're The One That I Want”</a>, from the musical “Grease”, trades the original's fun, upbeat cheekiness for torpid string arrangements and a sort of whiny desperation laced with charming touches of mild condescension. <a href=""http://youtu.be/L-wsep7aYLg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Boris""</a>, a song about sexual harassment in the music industry by the (female) duo BOY, puts Hemerlein in the place of the song's leering male speaker and swaps out the original version's lyric about offering a cookie for an offer of Codeine. What is the point of this? Who knows. Like so much else on this pretty, polished album, it doesn't seem like it was done for much of a reason at all.</p></div>"|18969.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18969-lo-fang-blue-film/|5.1|Kyle Kramer

A lot of Speedy Ortiz songs seem to start this way, somewhere between a snicker and a shrug, like Dupuis just showed up late for class in snowboots and a swimcap. Throughout <i>Real Hair</i>, Dupuis keeps finding herself in some awfully precarious positions: sleepless on ""American Horror"", falling ""for a bonebag"" on ""Oxygal"", falling—or is it not falling—for a ""bad news"" waiter on ""Shine Theory."" But, whatever comes their way, on <i>Real Hair</i>, the increasingly confident Speedy Ortiz seem more than capable of figuring something out.</p>
<p>From the start, Speedy Ortiz have fared best in the margins. Their rangy, slack-happy music is prone to wandering, but they never drift so far as to leave the hook behind. Bassist Darl Ferm and drummer Mike Falcone have tightened up tighter, while Dupuis and Matt Robidoux's dualing guitars are still perched on the precipice of stringent and slipshod. And these songs are just lousy with melody; there's distortion everywhere, but the occasional dissonance of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18245-speedy-ortiz-major-arcana/"" target=""_blank""><i>Major Arcana</i></a>'s given way to a heady, fuzzed-out whoosh. As a lyricist, Dupuis is every bit as fond of the inscrutable left turn as the defense-stripping full-reveal, and the distance between the two is often a couple syllables at best. And she's a chatty, candid, elastic vocalist, taking each syllable as it comes. Dupuis, Master's candidate and Malkmus stan, is a student of words: not just what they mean, but how those meanings intersect. You can skim through <i>Real Hair</i>, taking pleasure in its intricate guitar fuzzbombing and the curious pleasures of Dupuis' language: peep ""someone who sleeps with her neck in reverse,"" or try and guess at how she plans to ""coax the pretty waiter from his restaurant."" Dig in deeper, though, and Dupuis' tangled lines slowly start to unravel.</p>
<p><i>Real Hair</i> keeps its runtimes tight and its choruses front-and-center, pulling in some of <i>Major Arcana</i>'s looser ends without sacrificing its fall-apart charms. Everything Speedy Ortiz do well—willful sloppiness, keep-'em-guessing lyricism, and Dupuis' sharp, knowing singing—seems turned up a couple notches on opener ""American Horror"". As Dupuis and Matt Robidoux pile one spiny guitar atop another, ""Horror"" slides from a conversational verse into a stompbox-detonating chorus. ""Trust me just to my own feet,"" Dupuis pleads mid-explosion, ""and keep me here for a whole week."" You can get yourself stuck puzzling out the glue and web full of bees Dupuis sings of on ""Horror"", but once they punch into that chorus of ""baby, you look so crazy,"" ambiguity's pretty much out the window. Sure enough, ""Oxygal"" turns up the inscrutability a few clicks. ""Oxygal"" is <i>Real Hair</i> at its most Frankensteinian, a stop-and-chop verse and woozily desperate chorus that don't seem to belong in the same tune. When it works, there's a gawky, black Chucks-and-tux elegance to Speedy Ortiz' carefully calamitous songcraft, but the jittery ""Oxygal"" stumbles around a bit too much to ever quite find its footing.</p>
<p>Over shaggy ""Cut Your Hair"" guitars, ""Everything's Bigger"" finds Dupuis connecting the dots between a lion, several sets of twins, the slipperiness of regional dialects, and a quick sojourn to the Green Mountain state. It's an odd one, for sure; these red herrings and unplanned asides give Dupuis' songs a certain spontaneity, like she's working them out in real time and keeps throwing in extra embellishments to mess with you. But Dupuis isn't just jamming a bunch of words together to fill stanzas; she's clearly trying to elucidate her points while offering something a little more interesting than a point-by-point. And, for all its misdirection, ""Bigger"" eventually just comes right out with it: ""it's hard to keep a dialect when you keep changing where you come from,"" Dupuis sings, a hint of bile creeping in.</p>
<p>Musically, Speedy Ortiz still worship at the altar of early 90s indie: Pavement, Helium, Archers of Loaf, their holy trinity. But Dupuis has emerged as a distinctive voice: funny, sharp, ever-so-slightly neurotic, with a tendency to trail off. You've gotta take personality where you can get it in indie rock these days, but by reasserting her own peculiarities—and casting aspersions at those who'd change theirs to suit a scenario—Dupuis just makes herself seem more, well, herself, going through some shit, but certainly never cowering to it.Dupuis has called <i>Major Arcana</i> ""kind of a <a href=""http://store.carparkrecords.com/products/522228-speedy-ortiz-real-hair"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">breakup jam</a>,"" framing <i>Real Hair</i>'s deep-digging as being more about getting her own shit together. Spindly closer ""Shine Theory"" presents Dupuis with what, on paper, appears to be a perfectly acceptable suitor. Still, she passes; ""I wanna want him so bad,"" she tells herself, ""but I don't recognize the charms that he has."" Though self-examination quickly turns to self-deprecation—as Dupuis puts her own charms under scrutiny—""Shine Theory"" is hardly self-pitying; when it's over, you picture Dupuis shrugging, throwing her books in her bag, and leaving the ""pretty waiter"" to his other tables.</p>
<p>It's tempting to paint Speedy Ortiz as more than they are: not just a very good band on their own terms, but an antidote to the mushmouthed, low-personality murmur blanketing much of circa-2014 indie rock. Though they seem a tad too casual for savior-types, it's hard to miss the things they're doing right. <i>Real Hair</i> takes the gloriously sloppy, haphazardly intricate Speedy Ortiz of <i>Major Arcana</i> and turns it bite-size, sharpening the focus without sanding off the edges. These songs are easy to like, but they're even better when you lean in close. And Dupuis—as a singer and lyricist alike—is only getting more precise and more peculiar. She isn't especially ""confessional,"" but she certainly puts it all out there; these songs unwind like a long, aimless phone call with an old friend, rife with in-jokes, strange segueways, and the occasional moment of clarity. And, simply from a bookkeeping standpoint, dropping an EP in the winter dead zone, some nine months after your debut LP, is about as smart a way as any to keep your name on people's lips. When that EP's as good as <i>Real Hair</i>? All the better.</p></div>"|18935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18935-speedy-ortiz-real-hair-ep/|7.6|Paul Thompson

Are you in a meaningful relationship with someone who <i>does</i><span>? If that’s the case, I don’t think I need to tell you the code we follow: Chino Moreno is <i>off. fucking. limits. </i>I suspect he’s become one of the most likable rock stars at his level because when he embarrasses himself—and he definitely has over the years—it happens in a way to which most people can relate. Which is to say, you get overly influenced by your friends, let your enthusiasm get the better of you, and try just a little too hard to look cool or to fit in. And that’s why he’s been forgiven time and time again, even after covering <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHLHF-nUEzQ&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Ice Cube’s “Wicked”</span></a><span> on a Korn album, tacking on the since-censored monologue at the end of </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGIKJNoC0nc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>“Pink Cellphone”</span></a><span> and </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jUPNqLTtuE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>remixing “Dragula” in </span><span>2012</span></a><span>. My love for </span><i>White Pony </i><span>runs too deep to link to the “Pink Maggit (Back to School)” video in good conscience.</span></span></p>
<p>And so when word got out about †††, it was framed as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/43411-deftones-dude-has-a-witch-house-project/"">“Chino Moreno’s witch house</a> project” and subsequently mocked as if witch house ever was responsible for a song as good as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvknOXGPzCQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)”</a>. Or that Moreno could make a bigger ass out of himself in this style than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27383-salem"">Salem</a> did. As it turns out, “witch house” only applied to their instantly dated font stylization and artwork, as soon we all found out that ††† was on some stadium-status electro-rock shit, think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode"">Depeche Mode</a> circa <i>Songs of Faith and Devotion</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails"">Nine Inch Nails</a>. Or more, accurately, that song <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure"">the Cure</a> did for the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGxAOrp9Nb4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Judge Dredd soundtrack</a>. Or Filter.</p>
<p>Which is to say that Moreno does embarrass himself here. Quite often. But you can’t blame it on witch house. There are a number of reasons why <i>†††</i> faceplants in a way that previous Moreno side projects <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11889-palms"">Palms</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4379-team-sleep"">Team Sleep</a> didn’t—while the latter two were also searching collaborations with trusted friends (here it’s Shaun Lopez of fellow Sactowners Far), they catered to Moreno’s more esoteric tastes and were meant for niche audiences. Meanwhile, ††† played Lollapalooza Chile with only two EPs to their name (both included in full here), so this is meant to be on the same scale as Deftones. And for the most part, you get potential Deftones songs that ensure you never again fail to appreciate the pummeling, inventive musicianship of Stephen Carpenter or Abe Cunningham or Sergio Vega.</p>
<p>You can’t doubt the enthusiasm or commitment, but there isn’t much in the way of craft—despite a professed love of the Tri Angle and Software labels, Lopez, Moreno, and the excellently named Chuck Doom crank the synths and sequencers like they were guitars and <i>†††</i> retains the same brickwalled, blinding sheen of Far’s proto-emo alt-metal. In fact, most of these plodding, perfunctory beats would’ve sounded dated around the time <i>Water &amp; Solutions</i> dropped. The sickly riffs of “†hholyghs†” bear a heavy influence of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead"">Portishead</a>’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqKcW8t0lLM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Over”</a>, a few more lope to the same uh-1,2-step as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eBZqmL8ehg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sneaker Pimps’ “6 Underground</a><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqKcW8t0lLM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">”</a>, and many more recall <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFIeM694yEY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the remix of “Hey Man, Nice Shot”</a> if we’re being real.</p>
<p>But if we’re <i>really</i> being real, Moreno’s the reason we’re here in the first place and a more accurate diagnosis of <i>†††</i>’s failings put the blame squarely on him. Maybe he’s trying to play to arena-goth type, as his concerns on <i>†††</i> are a confluence of religion, sex, and non-specific menace that can be neatly summed up as—“you’re kinda freaky. That turns me on. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAP0w51Yjig&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Let’s party.</a>” Which is totally not a problem, seeing as how about 75% of <i>White Pony</i> was about the same exact shit. And let’s not forget this a genre where Dave Gahan and Trent Reznor are setting the lyrical gold standard.</p>
<p>And yet, I’ve watched Moreno change...into kind of a creep, and considering the wincing awkwardness of it all, I had to check the credits to make sure Lopez wasn’t still working with Jonah Matranga. The first line on “†his is a †rick” is “something’s changed in your face I notice/ a different sparkle in those crazy eyes,” and from that moment going forward, Moreno’s guyliner’d leering just puts you on the defensive. And it’s hard to enjoy even the good parts of <i>†††</i>, knowing it’s probably a matter of seconds before Moreno spits game like “I gotta tell you something/ I wanna view your dreams/ I wanna pull out your crazy/ pour it over me” or “you make a godly servant/ protect your Bible between your knees.” There’s a 65% chance that “fron†iers” is a love song about strippers, and no one should have to <i>guess </i>about that sort of thing. This is not the same guy who responsible for a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um7ySTHsCf0&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">track that somehow allowed Maynard James Keenan to sound kinda seductive.</a></p>
<p>That said, there are good moments here—“†elepa†hy” is something genuinely new, scratching a disco itch and a good deal of ††† isn’t so far off from the booming R&amp;B-metal of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">Weeknd</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18458-the-weeknd-kiss-land"">Kiss Land</a></i>, albeit with slightly less laughable lyrics. New single “†he epilogue” manages a slinky, KROQ-ready chorus, “blk s†allion” earns its name as an electro inversion of <i>White Pony</i>, while the screaming fits in “bi†ches brew” and “†his is a †rick” prove that ††† would’ve been better off had Moreno just bore his fangs the whole way through. That’s about enough for an EP, but at 15 tracks, <i>†††</i> fails to establish much flow or continuity or variety, or...oh, fuck it—it’s just too damn long, the longest record Moreno’s ever made unless you think all 32 minutes of silence and hidden tracks at the end of <i>Around the Fur</i> “count.”</p>
<p>Is this is a bad time to mention that Moreno announced <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/crosses-chino-moreno-talks-depeche-mode-and-deja-vu-20140210"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Deftones will be taking the rest of 2014 off </a>while he focuses on †††? Hardly. If anything, it shows another reason why it’s so easy to stick with the guy, he keeps this stuff away from his main gig. And really, they’re in a good state<i>—Diamond Eyes</i> and <i>Koi No Yokan</i> found Deftones as vital and influential as ever, having recovered from their murky, muddled post-<i>White Pony</i> albums and the tragic, eventually fatal car accident suffered by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50322-rip-deftones-bassist-chi-cheng"">bassist Chi Cheng</a> in 2008. While ††† may be on the same scale as Deftones, they’re not a replacement, and it stands to reason that Moreno can ascend to the heights of their previous work. But on <i>†††</i>, it’s like he never had wings.</p></div>"|18989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18989-crosses-/|5.0|Ian Cohen

He looked for inspiration past Britain's borders, to Berlin and beyond, at a time when dubstep's nucleus remained embedded deep within a South London postcode. Alloying a steely rhythmic exoskeleton to a sound still largely regarded as a ghostly mutation of 2-step, the run of 12""s on his Skull Disco label successfully ushered the first wave of techno-dubstep hybrids into clubs before it folded in 2008.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That sombre tone and gloomy imagery has become a hallmark since, pressed everywhere from a fêted Ricardo Villalobos remix through to more recent work, incorporating uncommon instrumentation and Middle Eastern motifs. The producer crafts detailed headspaces and then erodes their parameters, invoking a level of uncertainty and crumbled-spliff paranoia. His exacting focus on dread makes his extensive, and often brilliant, catalogue somewhat foreboding. It also instils immediate apprehension when approaching this perplexing new EP, his first after a nearly two year absence. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Freezing Opening Thawing</i>'s opener<i> </i>may be the most dramatic outlier in Shackleton's entire body of work, although not without some precedent: his sprawling <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ6I4CKu39Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mukuba Special""</a> re-work on a 2010 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14841-tradi-mods-vs-rockers-alternative-takes-on-congotronics/""><i>Congotronics</i> compilation</a> is the nearest relative. There, the contrast between growling sub-bass and brittle guitar notes was the sonic manifestation of two worlds meeting. Here, the title track crams a head-spinning mesh of synthetic sounds into the heavily treated topline, hoovering up anything vaguely earthen and leaving behind a complete void of low-end.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The result is startling: marimba and mbira lines dart across one another at high velocity; oscillators spin out of control; the infectious lead is so over-processed that whatever its original components, it finishes up as sequenced distress signals escaping short-circuiting mainframes. Once it finally locks into a convulsing, serpentine rhythm, Shackleton begins layering stranger noises still: Transylvanian hammer horror riffage, clattering hooks, no-wave synth stabs. For someone who has admitted to spending months at a time perfecting a single drum loop, the torrential hail feels cast off at random, triggered in real-time on an ironing-board's worth of cheap circuit-bent instruments. It's the sound of Shackleton cutting loose in delirious, utterly entrancing fashion.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Given the sensory overload, the pair of tracks that follow offer some breathing room and a human touch. Chinking metallurgy and a collapsing bassline warm up ""White Flower With Silvery Eye"", ushering in a more linear progression before ducking out for a <i>Deliverance</i>-style showdown between two diametrically opposed percussive factions: digitized blip versus palmed drum skin. That odd juxtaposition is magnified on ""Silver Keys"", which begins with a grim monophonic MIDI dawn chorus and ends closest to a traditional Shackleton piece, closing out proceedings on a dark and ritualistic stomp. As opposed to the scabrous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/967-coil/"">Coil</a>-style feedback splayed across 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16793-music-for-the-quiet-hour-the-drawbar-eps/""><i>Music for the Quiet Hour</i></a>, here the rich didgeridoo drone is somewhat comforting against the eerie melody; unusual but not necessarily unnatural.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Precious little unity binds <i>Freezing Thawing Opening</i>: the tracks are bright and glossy, fully blanched of color, and a sterility hangs in the atmosphere. Any attempt at human connection is paltry, even by Shackleton's standards. But in spite of the EP's innate weirdness every track remains supremely danceable and this could be his most groove-centric release yet. He's bound to continue as the chin-scratcher's choice, but if anything, this EP's about face will only add to Shackleton's peculiar magnetism.</p></div>"|18976.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18976-shackleton-freezing-thawing-opening-ep/|7.5|Gabriel Szatan

Broadcasted on Sunday mornings, the show aimed diverse, low-key music at people still up from the night before, acting as a salve for hangovers and a reprieve for benders. <i>Lowlife</i>, Malkin's first album and second release for LA-based Not Not Fun, is a foggy, sampladelic ode to Malkin's hometown and all of the red-eyed, busted heads scrambling around it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Lowlife</i> is an entirely downtempo affair, built out of narcoleptic soul loops, frazzled static, and distant, echoing vocal samples. It's slippery music that exists in the crevices between instrumental hip-hop, deep house, and trip-hop. Fittingly, it's the kind of music that could be used to fill spaces that you don't necessarily realize need to be filled: coffee shops, hip restaurants, hair salons. That's not a slight: <i>Lowlife</i> is coolly passive and unchallenging by design. Anything more might further fry its intended audience.</span></p>
<p>""Lovesick"", which at nine minutes constitutes more than a quarter of <i>Lowlife</i>'s 33-minute runtime, is the album's spectacular centerpiece. Relying on a short congo loop and a velvet bassline, Malkin mixes in bits of dialogue, street noises, and a lugubrious moan to devastating effect, finding a touch of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22117-theo-parrish/"">Theo Parrish</a>'s elegance (though not his complexity). If most of Malkin's music is about the comedown, ""Lovesick"" is the party: a series of seemingly trivial exchanges and gestures that, you realize later, ended up being a pretty good night. ""Lovesick"" is familiar musically, but its luxe momentum is rare, and it belongs in heady DJ sets and after-after-party mixtapes alike.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The remainder of <i>Lowlife</i> isn't nearly so deft or assertive, and while none of its six tracks are failures, there's little risked and little gained. The styles range from dusky ambience (""Outcome"", the post-""Lovesick"" chillout) to ornery, rain-soaked glitch (""Spit at the Mirror""). ""Night and Day""'s ambling breakbeat and mournful horns are basically lounge music, which is what we might call Afterhours if it lacked some of its experimental impulses.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">You'll never be sorry you're listening to <i>Lowlife</i>, though you won't often realize you are. Its slight construction and total commitment to vibes makes it unlikely to jar or disrupt. Compare <i>Lowlife</i>'s smokey, city-at-night evocations to, say, those of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a>, and understand how modest this record really is. Malkin, though, proves a potent sampler, and ""Lovesick"" offers a glimpse of how arresting his music can be when he attempts something a little more ambitious.</p></div>"|19005.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19005-afterhours-lowlife/|6.5|Andrew Gaerig

If you've read anything about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31483-temples/"" target=""_blank"">Temples</a>, you've likely this already absorbed this fact. That is because—and forgive the bluntness—Noel Gallagher's endorsement is easily the most remarkable thing about Temples, who offer a studious recreation of psychedelic rock so devoid of an individual personality that the only way to discuss them is to check off the high-profile industry legends who have endorsed them and the legendary records they crib from. </p>
<p>This sounds harsh and damning, but <i>Sun Structures</i> is not a <i>bad</i> album. Singer/bassist Thomas Warmsley and guitarist/vocalist James Bagshaw, the leading forces behind the group, come by their obsessions honestly, which, when it comes to influences, is the only thing that matters: They talk about their love of the Byrds, the Nazz, and Marc Bolan in interviews with intelligence and feeling, and <i>Sun Structures</i> reproduces the sounds of its era with a painstaking, granular attention to detail. If you were inclined, you could isolate every snare crack and background ""ahh"" and source it right back to a specific two-second snatch of a classic psych record. </p>
<p>Which also points to why it's difficult to feel invested in Temples: This is pretty much <i>all</i> you can do with <i>Sun Structures</i>. There is nothing here to absorb about psychedelic music that Temples haven't already absorbed for you, and without imparting their own ideas. They are <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28673-tame-impala/"" target=""_blank"">Tame Impala</a> minus the sneaky modernizing touches, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30523-foxygen/"" target=""_blank"">Foxygen</a> sapped of irreverence. There are moments to admire on <i>Sun Structures,</i> but very little to remember and less to love: ""Shelter Song"" has pretty good chorus motion, in the way you might appreciate how two pieces of a modular shelving unit snap in place. ""Keep in the Dark"" is a good, strong T. Rex pop-rock tune, easily the most memorable four and a half minutes of <i>Sun Structures</i>' hour-long running time. And the keening, glassy guitar riff on ""Mesmerise"" is one of the few moments where Temples channel something close to actual euphoria. Euphoria  should always be a byproduct of good psychedelic music; if it's missing, you should check the dosage.</p>
<p>Temples are phenomenally successful for a fledgling band. They've already notched opening slots for Suede, Kasabian, the Rolling Stones. Given their mastery of sound and the strength of their execution on <i>Sun Structures</i>, it's easy to imagine bigger successes in the future—awards-show slots, tribute shows, commercial syncs. But when you're operating within a strict template, you have to find some distinctive way to fill it out—a felicitous phrasing here, an unexpected chord change there. Without those elements, there's little on <i>Sun Structures</i> to remind you that you are, in fact, listening to a new band called Temples. </p></div>"|18955.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18955-temples-sun-structures/|5.5|Jayson Greene

The association with Shibuya-kei chic expanded into international-minded polyglot goodwill, the consciously high-concept Michel Gondry music video (the time-bending DePalma-gone-palindrome <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN9auBn6Jys"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Sugar Water”</a>), the collaborations with a then-emergent Sean Lennon, the playful but well-composed hip-hop-adjacent eclecticism—it's hard to imagine Yuka Honda and Miho Hatori becoming minor sensations at any other time, no matter how casually their style nodded to the eras preceding them. They still made individual strides in the ten-plus years following a breakup that left 1999's <i>Stereo*</i><i>Type A, </i>their last significant work as a team, and continued to embody a stay-posi NYC boho philosophy that's all but disappeared from the city's current hipster-panic atmosphere. But is a new Cibo Matto album a brand-renewing nostalgia trip, or something deeper than that?</p>
<p>It only takes a brief acknowledgement of the conceptual thrust behind <i>Hotel Valentine </i>to get the feeling that their reunion has a more intent purpose than mere let's-get-the-band-back-together restlessness. There's a story to tell, even if it's a sort of indirect one that might have a lot more meaning than it lets on. It goes like this: there's a hotel with a ghost in it, and... well, the rest of the details are a bit more elusive, and intentionally so. The spirit isn't a threatening one, unless you count the bit in “MFN” when it's clear it doesn't want to be harassed by the only person who can see it (“Don't tell me what to do, I'm a <i>ghost</i>/ Don't throw the fuckin' oyster shells at me”). All the other blanks can only really be filled in by the music itself, which Honda and Hatori have put together in a way that sounds like their old collaborative identities answering for what their cross-cultural peers and successors have done in the intervening years.</p>
<p>If the eye-popping neon palette of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3zX_AT0Xco"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GEORGIA's video for “MFN”</a> evoked artists of a Mad Decent bloodline rather than the old Grand Royal-era phase of transcontinental pop-cool, much of the album does the same at subtler frequencies. It's less a direct homage than a parallel, maybe, but the Cibo Matto aesthetic operated on similar enough principles that <i>Hotel Valentine's</i> occasional leanings towards deep-bass microhouse revival (“Empty Pool”) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"" target=""_blank"">M.I.A.</a>-goes-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/916-chk-chk-chk/"" target=""_blank"">!!!</a> dance-punk (“10<sup>th</sup> Floor Ghost Girl”) seem like foregone (and natural) conclusions. Fortunately, the moments of genre blueprint-crumpling idiosyncrasy—the rickety but sinuous acid-jazz charge of “Emerald Tuesday”; the title track's codeine Tropicalia; the swooning acoustic-guitar soul of closer “Check Out”—are just as engaging, and in ways that sound both unconcerned with trendwatching. They reveal how many possibilities Cibo Matto have always been open to.</p>
<p>But it's the <i>mood </i>of <i>Hotel Valentine </i>that stands out the most. The allusive nature of their lyrics sometimes lets slip the occasional glibly funny detail or observation, like how the ghost notes in “Lobby” that the afterlife's advantages—not having to worry about radiation, guns, or criminalized marijuana—don't entirely cancel out the fact that you still can't really go out and do things. The setting of a hotel as a transitory living space merges the exploratory thrill of travel with the disconnect of not really living where you are. And the paranormal angle to this album is simultaneously odd and mournful, with enjoyable quirks like Hatori's deadpan rapping throughout and some characteristically goofy interjections from Reggie Watts on “Housekeeping” offset by more uncertain perspectives and anxious melodies. There's hints of a more ambivalent, somewhat lost entity in this hotel, floating around with a confused purpose (“Check In”), a displaced sense of awareness (“Déjà Vu”), and an identity crisis that puts its movements and communications in an American/African/Brazilian mishmash but still leaves it without a traceable source (“10<sup>th</sup> Floor Ghost Girl”).</p>
<p>And not all of that might even belong to the ghost alone. Make of that what you will when it comes to metaphorical statements—this could easily be a concept record about the disorientation and need to find connections that arise with the pop artist's idea of a global influence. But that's up to a lyrical interpretation that requires more clarification from the authors than they've decided to give. If you really do need it laid out, “Empty Pool” is probably the most explicit: “In an empty pool I was swimming alone/ But I felt someone calling me/ The only thing I found was the world that I know/ My heart was floating”. The rest isn't so easily figured out—but when a musical partnership has always been this skilled at synthesizing so many different ideas and sounds, the interpretation should be just as wide open.</p></div>"|18922.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18922-cibo-matto-hotel-valentine/|7.0|Nate Patrin

Most people know someone skeptical or dismissive of it, a class clown-type who'll derisively mimic a cut by huffing ""uhnt-chk-uhnt-chk-uhnt-chk"" while goofily nodding his head. Heed this warning: Paul Johnson's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrutLOI5wfQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Feel My M.F. Bass</a>"" will be a boon to this person. Shrill and stone-stoopid, the song's refrain repeats as such: ""Feel my moth-er-fuck-ing bass in your face/ Feel my moth-er-fuck-ing bass in your face."" The rhythm, composed on a then-cheap, probably discarded drum machine, goes ""uhnt-chk-uhnt-chk-uhnt-chk"" except when it goes ""unt-uhnt-uhnt-uhnt."" The bass line sounds like...well, there is no bass line. But if you dropped this little chunk of rhythmic coal on the South or West side of Chicago in 1994, or if you drop it just about anywhere in Europe in 2014, people go wild.</p>
<p>""Feel My M.F. Bass"" is a standout track from <i>Hardcore Traxx: Dance Mania Records 1986-1997</i>, the first-ever compilation to honor Chicago house music's coarse, brilliant, and suddenly trendy prodigal son. Best known for lewd, raw, high-tempo tracks—a style known then and now as ghetto house—Dance Mania churned out dozens of classic singles that rarely escaped the Midwest. The label was, essentially, primed to run as a modest small business: attract a dedicated, local following by using its paltry resources to shake as many asses as possible.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ray Barney and Duane Buford started Dance Mania in 1985, running it through the 1990s. When Barney resurrected the label recently, he did it for the same reason he made so many of the choices that shaped Dance Mania: it seemed like a practical business decision. European DJs, it turned out, were paying hundreds of dollars for Dance Mania 12""s, and Barney had shelves full of unbought records in his basement.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This uptick in popularity found influential Russian DJ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31916-nina-kraviz/"">Nina Kraviz</a> saying <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast-episode.aspx?id=296&amp;comments=5"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">things like</a>, ""Sometimes I think that my only purpose of DJing is to play Dance Mania records!"" to anyone who would listen. (Her loving, abstract ode to the label, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=605bwlAz_iQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghetto Kraviz</a>"", was a smash.) Boysnoize curated a <a href=""http://boysnoize.com/bnr_release/releases/boysnoize-records/boysnoize-presents-dance-mania"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tribute album</a>. When art-damaged misfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28985-actress/"">Actress</a> toured America late in 2013, he brought Dance Mania mainstay Parris Mitchell with him. The label's earliest shoutout remains its biggest: ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNjhsPt_8Gw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Teachers</a>"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a>'s 1997 ode to their producer heroes not only namechecks many of Dance Mania's principals, it openly apes the Parris Mitchell Project's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P8nCeweu9w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ghetto Shout Out!!</a>""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The first third of <i>Hardcore Traxx</i> traces DM's early years, when it was releasing good but familiar first-wave Chicago house: diva-scorched anthems that implore you to jack your body and submit yourself to ""house nation."" After failing to land the type of European hit that buoyed peer labels like Traxx and DJ International, Barney—who, after college, helped turn his father's popular South side record store into a record distribution hub—leveraged his network of DJs to cater to the local market. Unable to afford studio time, Dance Mania producers recorded their tracks in their homes, often with little more than a drum machine and a sampler. The crass mantras needed not appeal to radio jocks and helped attract an audience increasingly interested in hip-hop.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like garage rock or blues or any art that's trying to accomplish a lot with very little, a surprising amount of weirdness ensued. There's lots of grunting and wheezing on <i>Hardcore Traxx</i>; rappers sound like cartoons and MCs like carnal preachers. Dance Mania is a testament to the power of the riff. In the best DM tracks every single element functions as a hook: Uhn-chk-Uhn-chk-Ride-me-baby. Whether you find dance music far too repetitive or you live for old Traxx 12""s, you will remember Dance Mania's tracks, as they are among the catchiest and most brazen of their kind, alternately hypnotic and disruptive.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For much of the 90s, DM's local focus shielded it from Europe's abandonment of first-wave American dance musics. The label just kept churning out tracks, eventually fostering ghetto house offshoots juke and footwork (footwork legends <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/400544-RP-Boo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RP Boo</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30360-traxman/"">Traxman</a> recorded for the label). Declining vinyl sales shuttered the label in 2001, but even that seems like a blessing. Dance Mania is one of the few early house labels to remain on good terms with most of its artists.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The success of ghetto house and Dance Mania was built on a really simple concept. You could hear Traxmen &amp; Eric Martin's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFXA5cB9M-0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hit It from the Back</a>"" in a field rave in Wisconsin for the same reason you could hear it in a seedy Chicago club: it was (and still is) really good at making people grind their bodies against one another. The surge in popularity overseas no doubt stems in part from the fact that ghetto house is perhaps the only large American dance subgenre not to have been co-opted by Europe in the 1990s. But the local flavor—that of a neighborhood shop—persists. To hear ""Ghetto Shout Out!!""'s call and response—""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabrini-Green"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cabrini-Green</a> in this motherfucker? <i>Hell yeah</i>!""—is to hear how DM helped get off a lot of people who really, <i>really</i> needed to get off. And those who didn't need to get off, too. Say this about anyone who mocks ""Feel my M.F. Bass"": he will be feeling this lethally catchy, modestly conceived motherfucking bass in his face for days.</p></div>"|18947.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18947-hardcore-traxx-dance-mania-records-1986-1997/|8.5|Andrew Gaerig

It’s the Philadelphia band’s second full-length, for one thing. Beyond that, Brendan Lukens recently finished his second year at Drexel University, and he never lets you forget what 21-year-old college students are often like—culturally literate, if not necessarily “book smart,” blurring the line between introspective and self-obsessed, impressed by their capacity for clever wordplay and emotional awareness while knowing both of those qualities conspire to prevent people from saying what they actually feel. And due to the all of the aforementioned, Lukens is kinda full of it, too. He won’t exactly lie to you, but he’ll tell you what he aspires to be while doing the exact opposite. Observe this howler from “Fine, Great”: “I hate having to think about the future/ when all I want to do is worry about everyone but me.”</p>
<p>There’s a fine semantic misdirection here, and he knows it: it’s a song about how much of a pain in the ass it is to have people care about you, and all he really wants is for everyone to worry about someone other than Brendan Lukens. He can do that just fine, great? Along with fellow MB songwriter Jacob Ewald, Lukens frets over the past, future, and especially the present. He thinks about the next five minutes, the next morning, and whether his death will be cool enough to get a mention from <a href=""http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/bio?section=resources/inside_station/newsteam&amp;id=5771836"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jim Gardner on Channel 6 Action News.</a> And he worries a hell of a lot about himself, and how other people figure into that. It’s a lot to endure because people in Lukens’ situation get drunk most every night, stumble into relationships, and run from their problems. If you’re in this emotionally combustible state, you’ll relate to <i>You’re Gonna Miss It All</i> directly and deeply. If you at least recognize it in retrospect, you can just as easily appreciate its wealth of infectious songs that are both sharply observed and sharply written.</p>
<p>About that last descriptor, Lukens describes himself as “sharp as a tack/ but in the sense that I'm not smart just a prick.” These songs are often funny and can induce wincing recalls of your most embarrassing romantic fuck-ups, but Lukens doesn’t seem all that concerned about being liked or admirable. If he’s pissed at you, he’ll probably just say “fuck you.” If he’s excited about the fact that you sat next to him on the couch instead of ignoring him like the last time you hung out, he’ll add “niiiice” as an aside. He likes metaphor, but he's much better at literalism, so the aspirational poetics of “Notes” don’t hit as squarely as the times where he describes a lonely Friday night as “no better time for exercise wishing you were still my girlfriend.”  </p>
<p>Which explains why Modern Baseball have namechecked <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4877-tokyo-police-club"">Tokyo Police Club</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5337-los-campesinos"">Los Campesinos!</a> as formative influences. That much is conveyed through similarly short and spiky songs that don’t quite fit as pop, punk, or pop-punk. <i>You’re Gonna Miss It All</i> mostly concerns itself with wasted time, but it doesn’t waste much itself, dense with both hooks and lyrical barbs. Likewise, Ewald’s nasal, nerdy, and needy vocals bring to mind not only David Monks and Gareth David, but elder prose-songwriting bards like Craig Finn and John Darnielle. To say they can be a dealbreaker is an understatement: upon hearing him pronounce “accoutrements,” “DIY ethics,” and “Mommy and Daddy’s data plan” in the same song or getting a little too Urkel-esque with the hook from “Broken Cash Machine” (“why did I do that?”) some people might flat-out refuse to even reach the bargaining table.</p>
<p>Like pretty much every guitar band these days that doesn’t immediately scan as “indie rock,” Modern Baseball have been lumped into “emo”—and yes, considering Modern Baseball are probably <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer"">Weezer</a> fans and are caught up in girl problems of their own making, that label sticks to an extent. Thing is, the actual music of <i>You’re Gonna Miss It All</i> is just about everything <i>but</i> emo, mostly some code-splitting of the pop-punk double helix. There’s shout-and-whoa power-pop (“Charlie Black”), prim twee (“Going to Bed Now”), folky punk (“<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16439-your-graduation/"">Your Graduation</a>”), all built around sturdy choruses. One thing Modern Baseball do have in common with their trendpiece peers is that they’re getting attention because they’re much, <i>much</i> better at making music than they were two years ago. This is evident in the songwriting, which is more confident and ambitious, but just as importantly, the production. <i>You're Gonna Miss It All</i> was mastered by Will Yip (basically the Steve Albini of this scene) and engineered by Jonathan Low, a guy who’s worked on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national"">the National</a>’s records. So needless to say, it’s going to sound a lot more professional than <i>Sports</i>, a charmingly amateur affair that seemed content to be passed around amongst Modern Baseball’s Facebook friends.</p>
<p>And that’s crucial, since Modern Baseball are a band that deserves to engage a wider audience. Nonetheless, Lukens is  still dealing in small stakes. He tries to think himself into a relationship he’s trying to talk and drink himself out of. When he does make a move, he worries about sticking around too long because her roommates might hear them. He goes to apartment parties, drinks because he drank the night before, can think of little besides the smell of garlic and coffee on his breath and goes from “living like a king without you” to “living like a piece of shit without you” in about a minute. Considering their common Philadelphia homebase, a fun exercise is to imagine <i>You’re Gonna Miss It All</i> as the other side of the stories told on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31022-waxahatchee"">Waxahatchee</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17688-waxahatchee-cerulean-salt/""><i>Cerulean Salt</i></a>.  Of course, the narrators are totally mismatched, but all of their songs are dysfunctional anyway. Kate Crutchfield may be singing about many of the same things, but she sounds wearier, wiser, someone you’d ensure with your secrets and seek out for advice. I don’t know if I’d trust Brendan Lukens to complete a beer run for a case of Keystone Lite, he’d probably come back with a six-pack and a funny story about the girl he met from his old high school along the way—these are the small, relatable pleasures of which a Modern Baseball song is made.</p></div>"|18984.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18984-modern-baseball-youre-gonna-miss-it-all/|7.2|Ian Cohen

When I stick my head under the sonic shower of his new record, </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Soak</span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><i>,</i> it induces the same dizziness as many high-speed style-mashups do, such as the frantic blasts of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3111-naked-city/"">Naked City</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">, the hyper-cutting sample-barrages of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3181-john-oswald/"">John Oswald</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">’s </span><a href=""http://www.plunderphonics.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Plunderphonics</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">, or the cartoon scores of </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Stalling"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carl Stalling</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">.

<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">What makes </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><i>Soak</i> </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">so dizzying is not shifts in style, but tone. Stretches of restraint jump into moments of crashing bombast; broad melodrama mixes with maudlin strings and sad vocals. The leaps aren’t disorienting because they’re fast—though they can be—but because they’re so big; Thirwell loves bounding over the top with his escalating crescendoes, orchestrated swells, and dramatic effects. Add his ever-growing skills as a composer and arranger—he’s currently serving that role for Adult Swim’s long-running </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Venture_Bros."" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Venture Bros.</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">—</span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">and you get music that’s both precise and unpredictable, both painstaking and audacious. You get “Halloween/Turbulence”, which somehow sounds like a 70’s TV mystery theme, a </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> outtake, and a </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Orff"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carl Orff</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> cantata.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">The bewildering effect of such tonal chopping makes it hard to judge </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><i>Soak</i> </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">objectively. Do I like “Kamikaze”’s meld of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"">the Flaming Lips</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> because it’s as good as those groups, or because I’m amazed that Thirlwell can evoke them? Does the </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"">Tom-Waits</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">-as-horror-flick growl of “Warm Leatherette” really quicken my pulse, or just sound like it should? All I can say for sure is </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Soak</span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> puzzles me in an exhilarating way, even when I don’t find it memorable or pleasurable. When it actually </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">is </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">a pleasure, as during the </span><a href=""http://youtu.be/mjdRgBAY278"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bonanza</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">-style horn-driven climaxes of “Spat,” it’s palpably thrilling. But it’s always interesting, if only because of the anticipation for what musical histrionics Thirlwell might plunge into next. Which makes it pretty </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">hard not to pay attention to </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><i>Soak</i> </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">when it’s playing.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That’s not the case with </span><span><i>The Blue Eyes</i>,</span><span> Thirwell’s soundtrack for a movie of the same name. If </span><span><i>Soak</i> </span><span>is disorienting to a fault, this album is the opposite—eminently clear about its intentions, about the emotions it’s trying to convey and the response it hopes to evoke. (One track of scary, Hitchock-worthy strings is called “Stabber”). It's rather typical soundtrack music, constructed to complement and accent visuals by finding the universal notes that reflect them. On those terms, it’s successful—Thirlwell’s a pro with expressive sonics, and he’s especially good at darker-toned moments. Pieces such as the rumbling “Muted World” and ghostly “Long View” are thoroughly chilling, certainly adding depth to any pictures. But ultimately the music on </span><span><i>The Blue Eyes</i> </span><span>is too conventionally filmic to provide a full experience by itself. It feels more in service of someone else’s images than capable of inspiring them on its own.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">In other words, I’d rather watch the imaginary film that </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Soak </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">projects in my head than the actual one that </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">The Blue Eyes </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">soundtracks.

Thirlwell’s work as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1527-foetus/"" target=""_blank"">Foetus</a> is disorienting. When I stick my head under the sonic shower of his new record, </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Soak</span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><i>,</i> it induces the same dizziness as many high-speed style-mashups do, such as the frantic blasts of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3111-naked-city/"">Naked City</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">, the hyper-cutting sample-barrages of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3181-john-oswald/"">John Oswald</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">’s </span><a href=""http://www.plunderphonics.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Plunderphonics</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">, or the cartoon scores of </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Stalling"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carl Stalling</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">. Which is weird, because Foetus' music isn’t really a mashup. </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Soak</span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">—much like it’s 2010 companion piece, </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Hide</span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">—is basically full-on rock'n'roll, albeit of the theatrical, sometimes even symphonic variety.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">What makes </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><i>Soak</i> </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">so dizzying is not shifts in style, but tone. Stretches of restraint jump into moments of crashing bombast; broad melodrama mixes with maudlin strings and sad vocals. The leaps aren’t disorienting because they’re fast—though they can be—but because they’re so big; Thirwell loves bounding over the top with his escalating crescendoes, orchestrated swells, and dramatic effects. Add his ever-growing skills as a composer and arranger—he’s currently serving that role for Adult Swim’s long-running </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Venture_Bros."" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Venture Bros.</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">—</span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">and you get music that’s both precise and unpredictable, both painstaking and audacious. You get “Halloween/Turbulence”, which somehow sounds like a 70’s TV mystery theme, a </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> outtake, and a </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Orff"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carl Orff</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> cantata.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">The bewildering effect of such tonal chopping makes it hard to judge </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><i>Soak</i> </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">objectively. Do I like “Kamikaze”’s meld of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"">the Flaming Lips</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> because it’s as good as those groups, or because I’m amazed that Thirlwell can evoke them? Does the </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"">Tom-Waits</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">-as-horror-flick growl of “Warm Leatherette” really quicken my pulse, or just sound like it should? All I can say for sure is </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Soak</span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> puzzles me in an exhilarating way, even when I don’t find it memorable or pleasurable. When it actually </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">is </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">a pleasure, as during the </span><a href=""http://youtu.be/mjdRgBAY278"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bonanza</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">-style horn-driven climaxes of “Spat,” it’s palpably thrilling. But it’s always interesting, if only because of the anticipation for what musical histrionics Thirlwell might plunge into next. Which makes it pretty </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">hard not to pay attention to </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><i>Soak</i> </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">when it’s playing.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That’s not the case with </span><span><i>The Blue Eyes</i>,</span><span> Thirwell’s soundtrack for a movie of the same name. If </span><span><i>Soak</i> </span><span>is disorienting to a fault, this album is the opposite—eminently clear about its intentions, about the emotions it’s trying to convey and the response it hopes to evoke. (One track of scary, Hitchock-worthy strings is called “Stabber”). It's rather typical soundtrack music, constructed to complement and accent visuals by finding the universal notes that reflect them. On those terms, it’s successful—Thirlwell’s a pro with expressive sonics, and he’s especially good at darker-toned moments. Pieces such as the rumbling “Muted World” and ghostly “Long View” are thoroughly chilling, certainly adding depth to any pictures. But ultimately the music on </span><span><i>The Blue Eyes</i> </span><span>is too conventionally filmic to provide a full experience by itself. It feels more in service of someone else’s images than capable of inspiring them on its own.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">In other words, I’d rather watch the imaginary film that </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Soak </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">projects in my head than the actual one that </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">The Blue Eyes </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">soundtracks. That’s partially due to the fearless unpredictability of the former—whatever movie it could accompany would likely look different every time I’d watch, and even once I’d gotten used to the plot the editing would still surprise me.

It’s the Atlanta-based side-project of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28094-washed-out/"" target=""_blank"">Washed Out</a> keyboard player Phil Jones, whose love for all things wavy invites poor choices musically and lyrically at every turn. Where there’s a chance for a new color in his palette, Jones opts for the same icy guitars and the vaguest of moods. Where there’s a chance to have a song about something concrete, Jones opts for the most basic existential quandaries. He sets the bar so low yet still manages to trip over it and fall into a space once fertile with chillwave and shoegaze bands that's now an airless voidscape with salted soil and a decrepit sign that reads: “Vibes.” This is the environment Dog Bite creates, much like last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17704-dog-bite-velvet-changes/"" target=""_blank""><i>Velvet Changes</i></a> only more torpid and morose. Welcome.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Jones said he was inspired by a new set of sounds on this record, soul guys like Otis Redding and Isaac Hayes. </span><span class=""s2"">This is apparent</span><span class=""s1""> on <i>Tranquilizers</i> insofar as Otis Redding and Isaac Hayes are categorized as musicians much in the same way as Dog Bite, Frédéric Chopin and Nikki Sixx are also categorized as musicians. Beyond that, the analogue gets a little muddy. The sounds of Stax records filtered through a complex pedal board short-circuited with a bottle Codiene might get you there. But any actual soul on the record is obfuscated by a pastiche of effects-laden synths and guitars that don’t play music so much as they play <i>at</i> music, writing toward a feeling or an impression. Jones <a href=""http://www.imposemagazine.com/features/dog-bite-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> of the album, ""I<span>t’s music that just wants to hang out a little bit, talk about the universe, and then go home."" Which is to say the album strives to have the same kind of relationship as you had with Gavin, the guy who always wore a baja hoodie and had a Volcano vaporizer he called Mount Doom.  </span></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Luckily there’s “Wonder Dark”, one of the only songs whose textures are varied enough to raise an eyebrow. It has shape to it, it bellows a bit with the arrangement, and the guitars start to resemble something like coiled tension. But just as quickly as it arrives, <i>Tranquilizers </i>slips back into laminated shoegaze with ""Dream Feast"" and the rest. It's cavernous, yes, but a bass-heavy production with delayed treble guitar is dynamic once, not over and over again. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Take, too, the rhetorical questions that Jones offers throughout in his anemic half-baritone voice. “Where do we go?” and, “So what am I supposed to be?” are some hooks highlighted on the record, statements so vapid and feckless they make the bulk of Twitter on any given day seem Pulitzer-worthy. Even in performing music so instantly categorizable and comfortable, Dog Bite pretend to be lost souls who just want to ask the big questions. “Please help me” goes the chorus to “Royals” as a kind of meta-comment as the album slogs on at the same sub-marine trip-hop tempos on into its 30th minute.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><i>Tranquilzer</i>s does very little to reinvigorate or recontextualize chillwave or shoegaze and does even less to signify innovation on its own terms. Its main crime is that it's aggressively safe and begs to be classified as nothing other than a rank and file Washed Out side project. Late last year, Jones <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/carparkrecords/dog-bite-under-the-sun-mix/s-7Nw8n"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">put up</a></span><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/carparkrecords/dog-bite-under-the-sun-mix/s-7Nw8n"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> a mixtape</a> of personal influences which include dusty groove artists like Byrdie Green and Dorthy Ashby. It's beyond frustrating that the sharp mood of those reggae and soul songs that influence Jones are spread out paper-thin in monochromatic streaks. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi/"" target=""_blank"">Toro Y Moi</a> have moved on to lean disco-funk and Washed Out put a focus on textural variation by using over 50 different instruments on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18324-washed-out-paracosm/"">Paracosm</a>. </i>Dog Bite are about as late to the vibe party as possible. To say the songs are lifeless is to only pinpoint part of the problem—they are absent of the stuff that make music enjoyable to listen to.</p></div>"|19002.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19002-dog-bite-tranquilizers/|3.2|Jeremy D.

London’s culture of pirate radio stations has produced some of the world’s most vital music over this period, but those scenes—be it garage, grime, dubstep, or funky house—inevitably faced the glass ceiling that is the country’s pop charts. To be sure, tracks from the underground did eventually hit big: garage architect Artful Dodger scored massive pop hits with Craig David, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1096-dizzee-rascal/"" target=""_blank"">Dizzee Rascal</a> and Wiley did the same for grime. But none of those breakthroughs were as smooth or as sudden as that of the singer Kathleen Brien, whose debut single, “Katy on a Mission”, shot straight out of the funky scene into the top five.</p>
<p>In doing so, she set the precedent for the rapid rise of artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/"">Jessie Ware</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"" target=""_blank"">Disclosure</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31420-rudimental/"" target=""_blank"">Rudimental</a>, the latter two of which defined British pop music in 2013 while also making quicker and more legitimate inroads in America than any of their peers before them. Katy certainly benefited from the groundwork laid by others over the years, but she proved that full-on pop stardom could be immediate. But now she is trying to write a new chapter: the artist who exploded out of the London underground and then crafted a sustainable career on her own terms, without relying on newer trends or reliable pop heavyweights.</p>
<p>Well, that second part is more like 98% true. Two songs on her sophomore album, <i>Little Red</i>, find Katy B collaborating with Guy Chambers, the co-architect of obscenely massive singles and albums by Robbie Williams. But you wouldn’t know that without looking closely at the credits; <i>Little Red</i> is purely the work of a singer redefining her voice. Though it can initially feel understated and even closed off, with repeated listens it detaches Katy B from a specific sound and establishes her as a pop star with a coherent point of view.</p>
<p>The most visible example of this, if not quite the best, is the current single “Crying For No Reason”, one of the cuts co-written with Chambers. A ballad that threatens to blossom into a disco song but never does, it'd be hailed as perfectly left-field if it was Adele’s comeback single (and it could be). But in the context of Katy’s career, it strips away the thump of house that has been her essence. She chooses to let the single live or die on her ability to sell the song vocally, and the soft grace with which she hits the slowly escalating notes is something like watching a gymnast: Katy steps carefully but with strength, never launching herself into the chorus but instead opting for a churning build. Her stunning performance of the track on Graham Norton’s late night show is a study in confidence and the power of tension.<br/><br/>Like “Crying For No Reason”, <i>Little Red</i> hangs on moments that reveal themselves over time. “All My Lovin’” sounds at first like one of her most generic songs, a ballad that flirts with American dubstep’s crushing drops. But the way Katy’s vocals rise out of the chorus is sublime, and by the time the synths start to slyly sound like a vocoder, it's one of the album's standouts. “Tumbling Down” is another mid-tempo song, but Katy sings the chorus melody like a feather slowly fluttering to the ground.</p>
<p>There are bangers, too. “Aaliyah”, the Ware duet carried over from Katy’s late-2012 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17493-danger-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Danger</i> EP</a>, is her most smartly-written song but also works as pure dancefloor euphoria. On “Everything”, Katy dons the crown of the diva over a tech house beat, and there she finds the sweet spot where yearning and control meet. Then there's “Emotions”, the album’s showstopper. It is yet another ballad, but this one turns up the drama almost immediately, with big synth stabs and tightly coiled strings. The climax is the one point where <i>Little Red</i> suddenly seems to become fully aware of the broader musical context: the drum'n'bass beat nods toward Rudimental smashes like “Waiting All Night”, but “Emotions” is constructed as a slow burn and thus has much more emotional resonance.</p>
<p>All that said, <i>Little Red</i> may be seen as a slight step down by many, and that’s not without reason. The album kicks off with the perfectly adequate but hardly spectacular duo of “Next Thing” and “5 AM”; “Sapphire Blue” and “Still” are two more ballads that sandwich “Emotions” and neither quite reveal their charms, with “Still” being particularly gloopy in a Celine Dion way. And though Katy has potentially charted the course for the rest of her career with <i>Little Red</i>, it lacks the inherent thrill of its predecessor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15254-on-a-mission/"" target=""_blank""><i>On a Mission</i></a>, an album of UK dance sounds aimed squarely at the top of the charts.</p>
<p>Still, this is a deft step for Katy B. She sheds the schoolgirl innocence that accented her debut and dives deeper into herself, probing love, lust, sorrow, glee, and power dynamics from all angles. <i>Little Red</i> is not the best album it could have been—a few of the bonus tracks should have made the album proper—but Katy displays a vision for her career that suggests an exciting future.</p></div>"|18907.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18907-katy-b-little-red/|7.8|Jordan Sargent

They are named for the vast empty spaces traversed by the Kel Tamashek (aka Tuareg), traditional nomads for whom modern borders have been problematic. The band formed in Libya while in exile from Mali, and has always made music that passionately evokes its home; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15767-tassili/"" target=""_blank"">their last album</a> was recorded in the open air of that desert. Such an arrangement was not possible this time. The political situation in Mali made returning to the northern desert untenable, and though they’ve been driven from power in most places, the specter of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb—an organization ideologically opposed to music—still looms across a large swath of the Sahara.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The band instead set up a studio at a house in California’s Mojave desert near Joshua Tree National Park. Time in the Mojave hasn’t removed the Sahara from them, though—this music still moves like a sandstorm. Even at slow tempos it swirls with motion, and nearly all of its forward drive comes from the guitars and bass, with percussionist Said Ag Ayad able to frame the beat rather than having to provide all of it. The group trades off lead vocals and sings in unison, and the four guitarists seem more capable and versatile than ever. There are phrases and rhythms here that wouldn’t have been heard in their music previously.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">That growth extends to their album-making craft as well. They’ve become excellent at balancing feels and flow. “Toumast Tincha” opens the album with this sort of hovering feel that only this band can really do, guitars scattering like dust devils while Saul Williams provides a strange, understated spoken word intro. The album then kicks into a higher gear for “Chaghaybou,” and it’s just the first example of how well-paced it is. A few other Americans drop in. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/731-chavez/"" target=""_blank"">Chavez</a>’ Matt Sweeney and the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Josh Klinghoffer melt right into the guitarscape, but Nashville session fiddler Fats Kaplin lights up “Imdiwanin ahi Tifhamam” with a fiery performance that brings hints of his hometown to melodies from Al-Andaluse.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">It is in some respects hard to be a band like Tinariwen, releasing albums in a Western marketplace where the initial attention you received had a great deal to do with the novelty of your sound. Remaining true to your identity while also evolving and keeping an audience that’s always a moving target interested in you is a tough gig. On <i>Emmaar</i>, Tinariwen are up to the task.</p></div>"|18909.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18909-tinariwen-emmaar/|8.1|Joe Tangari

They made a series of bold, primary colored choices on that album, and had they gone down a similar path for a second LP, it would've been a complete slog. Only a few songs on <i>Thrashin'</i> transcended the “cartoon slacker” mire. It was an album that heavily referenced the 1990s, and not simply because of their guitar sound. They had lyrics about “Full House” and Crystal Pepsi. They slapped a <i>Jurassic Park</i> logo on the cover. One of their more contemporary subjects was a song about going on a “MySpace date”. Everything about it felt like a caricature built from memories steeped in Pogs, slap bracelets, and TGIF reruns. </p>
<p class=""p2"">Thankfully, the band largely stepped away from the caricature they created for themselves and adopted a new aesthetic for <i>Slip Away</i>. But they haven’t left the 1990s at all: They’ve launched themselves wholeheartedly into shoegaze territory. Largely gone are the defined guitar textures of their previous LP. Now, a plucked string rings for a bit longer, and when the entire band kicks in for full force, it’s one big gauzy mass of sound.</p>
<p class=""p2"">But if you take a moment to recall a successful record in the shoegaze canon, <i>Slip Away</i> crumbles quickly. Despite being only 37 minutes, it feels twice as long. Everything spins in place ad nauseam without much sense of movement. Sure, there's some passion here, but it's hard to take seriously when it's about fighting the babysitter's boyfriend (on a track called ""Fight the Babysitter's Boyfriend""). Singing from the perspective of a little kid, he delivers cringe-worthy things like, ""I know you've got a mustache/ But you've been treating my babysitter real bad"". Nothing about the song is particularly funny (except the noodly guitar solo toward the end), so it's hard to say whether or not the band's attempting satire. Further muddling things is a sincere-sounding rallying cry for high self-esteem that clearly doubles as an extended masturbation reference (""Touch Yrself"").</p>
<p class=""p2"">""Super Big Gulp"" and ""Thighmaster"" both coast on nostalgic references. There's nothing substantial in the way of narrative, humor, or insight, and sonically, the songs stay the monotonous course. Then there's ""Who Killed Kennedy"", which opens with a chug and launches into a series of conspiracy theories regarding JFK's assassination. At one point, Tucker Rountree goes full <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurring_Saturday_Night_Live_characters_and_sketches_introduced_2011%E2%80%932012#Drunk_Uncle"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drunk Uncle</a>, singing, ""I think Facebook travelled back in time,/ think about it, who could have organized the crime."" </p>
<p class=""p2"">It's not all bad. ""See Right Through"" has a strong central guitar and bass line, and the melody and lyrics are perfectly suited to Rountree's nasal vocals. ""Keep the Ships at Bay"" has muscle and drive, which largely makes up for how repetitive it is. They show the most promise on ""Out of Body Experience"", where they pick up the pace and turn up the power to deliver an exciting central hook. The song never gets stale or overstays its welcome—it's a legitimately captivating track with a melody that works well with Rountree's voice. His harmony at the chorus with Emily Oppenheimer is nice and somewhat restrained—a good look for this band. It's a welcome indication that they're capable of so much better than what they offer on <i>Slip Away</i>. They get bogged down by lame references, alluding to popular culture, glorifying Big Gulps as an American icon, and dare I say it, <a href=""http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2013/04/total_slacker_weed_party_olive_garden_times_square.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">being the band that smokes weed at the Olive Garden</a>.

Drummer Bryan Farjado plays in Kill the Client, Phobia, and Noisear, and bassist Teddy Patterson III was the longtime bassist for Burnt By the Sun. Gridlink even had a brief moment in the pop culture spotlight when their music was featured on an episode of <i>Homeland</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, fittingly during an interrogation scene. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Their 2008 debut <i>Amber Gray</i> and 2011's <i>Orphan</i>, both released on Hydra Head, were hyper-technical, futuristic albums so dense they could be called “full-lengths” despite their short running times. The two, combined, clock in at around 24 minutes, and feel like classics of the genre. But nothing lasts forever, especially in a genre where 30 minutes counts as a double LP.</span> <span style=""font-style: normal;"">Gridlink split up following the completion of their third record, </span><i>Longhena, </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">and while it's a shame that they are no more, they ended their career with a record insurmountable by themselves or their peers.</span></p>
<p>A cursory look at <i>Longhena</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">'s numbers may suggest that Gridlink was calming down. It's their longest record at 22 minutes, and features a couple songs that break the two-minute mark. But </span><i>Longhena</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is by far their most intense album, fueled by the fact that it was their last. You can hear that attitude in everyone's playing. Chang's screams are as much of a impenetrable wall as the noise he's in tandem with and also fighting against. Matsubara, who is the sole guitarist here, expunges notes with lethal precision, but varies up his riffing more. Some of the more melodic elements from Hayaino Daisuki, the demented party thrash-grind hybrid side project of Gridlink, appear on </span><i>Longhena</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. “Stay Without Me” is catchy in the way Mick Barr playing the Ratt songbook would be catchy. Like the rest of the band members, <span style=""font-style: normal;"">Matsubara</span> knew this was Gridlink's final stand, so he takes risks that garner huge dividends. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Mostly, the bulk of </span><i>Longhena</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is still ultracompact flares of humans replicating the madness of machinery without the sterility. They're the metal equivalent of nanotechnology—Matsubara packs in so much information without bloat. Chang, who's been neck-and-neck with the title for “Metal Poet Laureate” with Pig Destroyer's J.R. Hayes, fuses timeless themes of personal loss with the impersonal carnage of modern warfare. This line from the title track is particularly </span><span style=""font-style: normal;""><span style=""text-decoration: none;"">gutting: “The plate caught the round/ but inside I'm still bathed in shrapnel/ with concentration absent of doubt/ revel in the unimaginable slaughter.” He's coping with his cosmic insignificance while still forming a resistance against it.<br/></span></span></p>
<p>Grindcore is not a genre in which the word “beautiful” is used. Production is best left to a minimum, the more xeroxed the better. Lyrical themes revolve around every heinous form of destruction<span style=""font-style: normal;"">—</span>in broad strokes, with no room for subtleties. Repulsion, one of the style's founding fathers, forged their filth in the basements of Flint, Michigan, which was and still is the hallmark of urban decay brought on by corporate recklessness. Yet, there are a couple moments on <i>Longhena</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> that could be described as “beautiful.” Right off, the opening riff of “Constant Autumn” shows a range many bands can't conceptualize, much less harness. Matsubara sands down what would appear on a lush black metal record into a riff sleek in delivery and devastating on impact. Never has such exuberant joy been communicated in grindcore. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The third song, “Thirst Watcher”, is an instrumental piece consisting of Matsubara's clean guitar and and Pittsburgh-based composer Joey Molinaro's violin. He recorded a violin version of Discordance Axis' 2000 album </span><i>The Inalienable Dreamless </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">in 2011, so his presence is not only fitting from a compositional point of view, but it's heartening to see a fan get to contribute to his inspiration's passing gasp. While “Watcher” is sonically different from anything Gridlink has ever recorded, it still hangs on that same sheer wire of sanity that the rest of their songs do. The delicacy is just more upfront. Molinaro's violin also appears on “Autumn” and closing track “Look to Winward”, where in the latter it floats on the end of the song and gives a sense of closure not just to the album, but Gridlink's career as a whole. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Gridlink were a band that had no interest in sculpting false idols to kneel before. Putting it simply, they played only how they could play, and no one could match. </span><i>Longhena</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> fulfills the promise of Discordance Axis' discography and Gridlink's own first two records by pushing the potential of their own limits and what grindcore can be. Chang asks on “Ketsui”: “Are the fangs in our hearts now gone, or is it anger that keeps us alive?” Sometimes, metal and hardcore needs to be reminded that forging your own path is commendable above all, and </span><i>Longhena </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">is that reminder.</span></p></div>"|18916.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18916-gridlink-longhena/|8.0|Andy O'Connor

Could not be more excited. Think of when you’re visiting a friend’s house for the first time and they warmly warn you about how their bull mastiff can be awfully playful around new friends. It could be doing absolutely nothing all day and the moment you step in the door, they spring into action to waylay you with slobbering affection. And if you act surprised, or god forbid, resist it, you’re going to look like kind of an asshole. Sound familiar? Got that? Still in? Cool, because that’s pretty much what happens the moment you press play on <i>Galore</i>.</p>
<p>As far as what it sounds like, well, if the name “Thumpers” <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiptUShsnGs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">brings to mind the adorable rabbit from <i>Bambi</i> doing his thing</a> on giant floor toms, you’re on the right track. The fifth track on <i>Galore</i> is called “Come on Strong”, and it’s the record’s thematic mission statement, filled as it is with extroverted melodies, booming, insistent drums and glimmering production. It’s cute, percussive, motormouthed music that’s particularly prevalent and successful in Thumpers’ neck of the woods. But, god bless Thumpers, they don’t want to alienate a single one of you, so singles like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16089-unkinder-a-tougher-love/"">“Unkinder (A Tougher Love)”</a> and “Dancing’s Done” bound forward like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUHUmjLjZMc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Winnie the Pooh and his gang</a>, and for better or worse, they forgo the eccentricities of their peers—they aren’t as glitchy as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30749-alt-j"">Alt-J</a>, as annoyingly overstuffed as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29041-everything-everything"">Everything Everything</a>, or as flaccid as Two Door Cinema Club. By the same token, they aren’t as adventurous as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29039-bombay-bicycle-club/"">Bombay Bicycle Club</a> or dancefloor-oriented as John Hamson, Jr.’s former gig <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26767-friendly-fires/"">Friendly Fires.</a></p>
<p>In fact, Thumpers sound downright American—partly because they draw a lot of their sounds from post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/193-feels/""><i>Feels</i></a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"">Animal Collective</a>, but also due to their shock and awe policy of performing cannonballs without any concern for the splashback. Though a field recording of London’s idyllic Regent’s Canal graces opener “Marvel”, look at the cover, for crying out loud. These songs take place in swimming pools, but their aw-shucks attitude suggest they’re swimming holes. Likewise, even if the dominant theme in these songs are making your most treasured summer memories right now, they’re so stoked about them that they’re just going to drop <i>Galore</i> right in the middle of February. They just can’t wait three more months.</p>
<p>But the charm offensive can turn flat-out offensive if <i>Galore</i> catches you on the wrong day, and if that’s the case, you can look smack in the middle of the tracklist for the culprit: “Now We Are Sixteen” [ft. Summer Camp]. Not so much the song itself, though its dippy coed balladry does make for the weakest song here. Just read the title. If 2009’s obsession with the rudimentary aspects of nostalgia now triggers a certain kind of PTSD, <i>Galore</i> can be a pretty bad trip. The first words Marcus Pepperell sings are “stay young” and throughout he tries to speak in the language of hormonal teens: “we’re tired but ripe,”  “bed jumping, him and her are full of passions tonight,” Or, there’s the irrepressible and extremely grating superball arrangements of “Tame” and “Roller”, which remind you of just how masterfully <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12518-merriweather-post-pavilion/""><i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i></a> danced in a hippie-indie drum circle without just <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC-eM2_KudA&amp;feature=kp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bouncing around the room</a>.</p>
<p>No genre or band has ownership of the sound of a wet, hot American summer—you can hear it in any number of rock acts from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids/"">Japandroids</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29837-mikal-cronin/"">Mikal Cronin</a>specifically, or most strains of hip-hop, country or pop music. Yes, there’s pretty of sunlight on <i>Galore</i>, but no heat or friction, as everything from the production to Pepperell’s enunciation is so glassy that all of these somersaulting hooks might as well be gibberish. Sometimes, they are—“Tame” literally is built on “hummina, hummina.”</p>
<p>The real issue is more inherent in their accurately and unfortunately named collaborators on “Now We Are Sixteen”: no matter how enthusiastic and endearing Thumpers are on <i>Galore</i>, they’re camp counselors. Sure, they’re invested and they relate and they’ll do everything in their power to facilitate your good time. Problem is, there’s a disconnect: they can’t join you. And they’d prefer it if you kept the fun good and clean, so your parents don’t find out. And then you remember the sage lesson Thumpers’ namesake had imparted by his parents: ""If you can't say something nice, don't say nothing at all."" Good advice, but not the kind of earnest, rule-following that leads to the sort of adventures <i>Galore</i> so badly wants to be a part of.</p></div>"|18951.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18951-thumpers-galore/|6.0|Ian Cohen

With six albums in 10 years and never a misstep, Nadler has grown her own perceptive language—she's an old-soul lost in time like Sibylle Baier, but her music is blackened and more literary. Her songs have come steeped in misery and macabre, cobwebs and ashes, but Nadler is not a doomy aesthete merely for gloom's sake. She is devoted to Leonard Cohen and Joni Mitchell, and her music understands folk tradition. While her songs sound isolated and spiritually vintage, as if beamed from the grayscale interior of a Victorian home, her stories have been generous, selfless tales, heavy with metaphor and imagery. Nadler's poetic temperament and steady grace point to a darkness within us all—though her singing always seems to hone on mortality not for the purpose of crushing, existential missives, but in order to protect us.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Each of Nadler's albums has signaled subtle evolution. After channeling a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5907-ballads-of-living-and-dying/"">bewitched Hope Sandoval</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5908-the-saga-of-mayflower-may/"">establishing a gothic heart</a>, her sound became gorgeous and nuanced on 2007's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9955-songs-iii-bird-on-the-water/"">III</a></i>, broke from the freak-folk tag on 2009's astounding <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12813-little-hells/"">Little Hells</a></i>, and incorporated sing-song <a href=""http://thephoenix.com/Boston/music/121976-free-from-labels-songwriter-marissa-nadler-finds-/?page=2#TOPCONTENT"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gillian Welch-inspired</a> country pop on 2011's gleaming <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15544-marissa-nadler/"">Marissa Nadler</a></i>. Still, she has never let her dark essence slip away—this is a singer whose <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5907-ballads-of-living-and-dying/"">first record</a> mixed traditional English balladry with an arrangement of Edgar Allen Poe's ""Annabelle Lee"" and a song about the death of Virginia Woolf. ""I once was young and I once was strong,"" she sang then, in 2004, at age 23 on ""Box of Cedar"". Nadler's music has been tinged by country blues and murder balladry, by people who died alone and old loves who creep her memory. But empathy has defined her work. See, for example, Nadler’s tender treatment of the recurring figure <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unr3t09xiqU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mayflower May</a>, a lonely and reflective old woman, or the 20th-century siamese twin circus performers Daisy and Violet (2011's spellbinding<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G32BgjbRNAM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> ""Daisy, Where Did You Go?</a>"" explores what happened to Violet when Daisy died first, an especially harrowing piece of historical subject matter).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Nadler's self-described <a href=""http://www.popmatters.com/feature/170951-alabaster-queen-an-interview-with-marissa-nadler/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""dreadfully shy""</a> wallflower persona fits in well with these earlier records, filled with swaths of muted color and third-person characters. <i>July</i> is another side of Marissa Nadler; if she sounded older back on <i>Little Hells</i>, Nadler is younger and bolder now, in confessional mode. Here are intimately personal accounts of misread desire, an empty heart set by winter blues, and years wasted on a lover who could do no right. ""I called you when I was drunk all the time,"" Nadler sings on the quiet, finger-picked ""Holiday In"", stranded on a mountain in winter, recalling a depleted love. This is the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18491-bill-callahan-dream-river/"">""beer/thank-you""</a> of Nadler's new honest approach. ""I'd rather watch crime TV than see you again,"" she sings. It is a shocking but humanizing charm to hear Nadler reference even basic technologies in song. More so than any of Nadler's records, <i>July</i> is a self-knowing and zenlike advocate of change; ""I know better now/ I don't get as high,"" she sings on the intensely detailed breakup song ""Firecrackers,"" pointing blame at herself as she steadies her own romantic mess of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy6Olv3J4rI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ghosts and lovers</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>July</i> is more tactile thanks to new producer Randall Dunn, best known for his work with metal bands such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"">Earth</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"">Sunn O)))</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4783-wolves-in-the-throne-room/"">Wolves in the Throne Room</a>. (Dunn has also worked on folkier projects for Akron/Family and Six Organs of Admittance, but Nadler has ties to the black metal community, having collaborated with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4941-xasthur/"">Xasthur</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28801-locrain/"">Locrian</a>.) The pairing befits Nadler's sound. Like black metal, her songs are atmospheric, austere, and engulfing. At times, Nadler's resonant acoustic strums are coated thick, as if emboldened by the deep ebony outline of a Sharpie marker. Her gothic touchstones return more deliberately melodic, and the audible strength of her voice lends to a more idiosyncratic sound; even the quiet acoustic songs and piano ballad sound like they are set up on-stage. There are textured synths and the occasional electric guitar underneath, and the dramatic orchestral strings that underpin ""1923"" offer the song a sense of grandeur—""I called you from another century/ To see if the world had been kind and sweet,"" Nadler sings, offering not just an impressionistic line but a pointed one that sums up an essential idea about her work. It's Nadler's stacked, carefully pronounced harmonies, though, that really make these songs stand so tall.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The forward movement of <i>July</i> can be entrancing and propulsive: ""Drive"" and ""I've Got Your Name"" are evocative Americana road songs, the former cast with a cruel road-weary disaffection that she medicates naturally: ""Still remember all the words/ To every song you ever heard,"" Nadler sings, conjuring more direct, intuitive emotions than usual. There are grittier details here, too: ""Changed in a rest-stop into my dress/ Made sure not to touch the floor/ I've done that kind of thing before,"" she sings from the side of the I-95. Nadler always sounds like a journeying soul poet, but here she makes her rootless experience clear, as on the piercing ""Holiday In"": ""You have a girl in every state/ I know I'm in the way.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16336-marissa-nadler-dead-city-emily/"">""Dead City Emily""</a> is <i>July</i>'s hypnotic centerpiece, the realization of Nadler and Dunn's work at the stone-cold polar vortex of folk structure and doom metal mood. Nadler's rain-streaked music has an overcast glow here, one that comes with a first snowfall, the realism of dead leaves and paralyzing ice. Nadler has few direct contemporaries—Bill Callahan, Sharon Van Etten, or Alela Diane come to mind—but here, on <i>July</i>'s most extreme song, she could sensibly share bills with, say, Iceage or Deafheaven. The song’s fictional conversation is made of inner-strife, trapped in a devil town and a dead-end love, jaded towards the innate beauty of trees or birds—images Nadler has used throughout her songbook. Nadler typically speaks through female figures, and while there is struggle in this exchange, there is also power, like she is teaching another woman or warning her in secret. <i>July</i>'s stories are rich with such wisdom.</p></div>"|18941.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18941-marissa-nadler-july/|8.1|Jenn Pelly

Large chunks of her full-length debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30806-holly-herndon/""><i>Movement</i></a>, reflected the <a href=""http://www.mills.edu/academics/graduate/mus/programs/mfa_in_electronic_music.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mills College</a> graduate’s grounding in academia. Early on, electronic music was mostly the product of state-funded institutions like universities and public radio due to the vast resources needed to acquire and maintain the equipment. The people who had access to the machines in the 1950s and 60s were artists, theorists, and technicians, and not always in that order. Coming out of the world of 20th century classical music, which had happily abandoned the possibility of mass appeal, artists like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6pgklMAgIA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Cage</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbzw8VNkA5o&amp;list=PL70EB0A20DDFE6494"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Milton Babbitt</a> pursued electronic music with an exploratory zeal that often abandoned ideas conventional musicality. That electronic music from the academic world can often be described as dry and clinical is not a sleight—the pleasures are there, they just happen to be more cerebral. About half of the excellent <i>Movement</i> (""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC9XRpCOO6g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Breathe</a>"", ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14568-dilato/"">Dilato</a>"") worked this side of the room. But then there were tracks like ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14432-fade/"">Fade</a>"" and the title track, which applied Hendon’s brilliant textural ear and vocal manipulations to a context where rhythm and melody were equally important.  </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Chorus</i>, Herndon’s new two-song EP, essentially amplifies the extremes of her musical personality and pushes the tension almost to the breaking point. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16544-chorus/"">title track</a> already has the feel of minor landmark, as she chops and processes her voice into disorienting shapes while retaining its human core. In terms of her basic palette, she’s operating in a terrain not too far from Oneohtrix Point Never’s latest, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18537-oneohtrix-point-never-r-plus-seven/""><i>R Plus Seven</i></a>; ""Chorus"" has some of the cool, clean, and disconcertingly empty cast of an early computer’s 8-bit soundbank, and the fragments of her vocal evoke hand-keyed early sampling, where you’d play the shifted pitches on a keyboard. Using these vaguely retro tools, she’s crafted a sleek futuristic pop song with an experimental bent that is ultimately deeply emotional.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">The B-side, ""Solo Voice"", comes from a different place. It takes tiny shards of syllables and sets them ping-ponging between the speakers; as was often true on <i>Movement</i>, the massive amount of space means you sometimes wonder if the piece has ended only to have more notes emerge from the silence. It comes over like an art object as much as a piece of music, and it has its own kind of steely beauty despite its vastly more abstracted feel. The basic elements of ""Chorus"" and ""Solo Voice"" have much in common, but the difference in how they work is significant, which speaks to Herndon’s expansive range as a composer. As two sides of her aesthetic are pushed to new heights on this 12"", the possibilities of her future music seem vast indeed.</p></div>"|18923.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18923-holly-herndon-chorus-ep/|8.0|Mark Richardson

He emerged in the late 90s alongside Mr. Oizo (whose excellent, deranged 1999 album <i>Analog Worms Attack </i><span>was a Feadz co-production), accompanied Uffie during her stint in the spotlight from ""Pop the Glock"" onwards, and put in work for both BPitch Control and Ed Banger, two of the most vital, tastemaking labels of the 00s. Throughout that time, he's managed to build a following as both an influential DJ and a jack-of-all-trades producer who can dabble in just about any corner of dance music there is.</span></p>
<p><span>If his full-length debut, <i>Instant Alpha</i><span>, highlights anything, it's the limits of how far mere dabbling can get a producer—especially if that artist tries to fuse all his limited tricks together. </span><span><i>Instant Alpha</i> </span><span>betrays a sound that staples together the most immediate, surface-level pleasures of an accumulated jumble of styles and expects the in-your-face bits to prop up otherwise hollow-sounding tracks. Electro's Euro-slick decadence, trap's chest-out wildness, Southern rap's low-end throb, grime's raw low-budget futurism, house's lifeblood pulse, bass music's rhythmic elasticity—these ideas are all melted down and left to congeal on the counter, leaving a burnt yet cold pile of goo that sort of resembles a cursory club jam. </span></span></p>
<p>The main culprit is the impatient, almost assaultive way Feadz rolls out his beats. I say ""beats"" when a more accurate term would be <span>tics</span><span>—machine-gun kicks are shoved out into wide-open spaces where they're subjected to water-drip bloops, hyperactive stammering vocal snippets, strobing synthesizers that hiccup until they puke, and incessant empty-calorie hooks (like this unattributed winner from ""Papercut"": ""I spit fire like I tongue-kissed a dragon""). The line between that kind of thing being big dumb fun and a big dumb headache is almost invisible, but with a whole lot of momentum-shifting jumpiness and not a lot of time to build organically and gradually to a crescendo—most tracks are less than 3 1/2 minutes—it all feels too anxious and bristly to soundtrack anything short of a mindstate aided by moon rocks and vodka, and even then it might sour your mood. </span></p>
<p><span><span>Want a florid description of how the music's supposed to make you feel? ""The Purpose"" has you covered there, as the distorted voice of TTC's Teki Latex relays the agenda of a man who sounds like a benevolent megalomaniac of a DJ ambassador: ""Connecting minds together through an invisible network of vibrations, creating euphoric states, projecting childhood memories inside your brain, but taking you to yet unknown places."" You'll also get a good sense of the sound via the list of obvious influences. For instance, <span>""Electric Empire"", featuring guest vocalist Kito, is a thematic hybrid of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>'s roll-call ""Teachers"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1812-gza/"" target=""_blank"">GZA</a>'s ""Labels"" wordplay (""It's a house without a home/ Uptown in 'Techno City'/ With Mo'Wax than you can think of in your Metroplex Fantasy""). </span></span></span></p>
<p><span>There might be the occasional inspired rhythm track under all this mess—""Metaman"" and ""Eastside"" at least prove that Feadz knows his way around an 808 (or a simulacrum thereof)—but it's nothing you can't get from countless other artists who choose not to bury those beats in over-the-top hyperactivity like a parodic attempt at the next ""Harlem Shake"". It's all signifiers and nothing signified, exploring the possibilities of cross-genre dance music the same way mashing an action figure and a Barbie doll together explores sex.</span></p></div>"|19003.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19003-feadz-instant-alpha/|4.3|Nate Patrin

Records like 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10829-prism-of-the-eternal-now/"" target=""_blank""><i>Prism Of Eternal</i> <i>Now</i></a>, with their makeshift rhythms, devotionally droning ambience, and spiralling melodies now feel lovably antiquated—listen back and you can hear <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12518-merriweather-post-pavilion/"" target=""_blank""><i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i></a> in their bones. After a hiatus that lasted several years, White Rainbow returns with a self-released album, <i>Thru.U</i>, where he attempts to update his hippietastic sprawl with a more modern template and a newfound sense of irony. The result is a bizarre, occasionally confusing record of new age trap and psychedelic pop.</p>
<p><span>Funnily enough, ""Batman Palace"" picks up where his old material left off—sweeping melodies and iridescent synths—albeit juiced up with some jittery beats. Halfway between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28094-washed-out/"" target=""_blank"">Washed Out</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31089-dj-rashad/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Rashad</a>, its half-sung, half-hummed melodies and blanketing synths have all the baked-afternoon complacency of someone who just discovered chillwave. From there it gets different. Where Forkner used to bury the heart of his songs in slowly unfolding drones, now everything is front-and-centre, shoved forward by the rhythms. ""Killswitch"" is an uplifting trap number with an almost cinematic breadth to it—imagine one of the more melodic old White Rainbow tracks and plug in some Lex Luger hi-hats to get an idea. If that sounds a bit silly to you, that's how it comes out on the record, too.</span></p>
<p>Often it seems like Forkner is grabbing at contemporary sounds around him to try and fix himself back into a niche—after all, four years off the market must make it hard to find your place again, especially in a world as fickle as electronic music. But his grasping is amateurish; on ""Don't Wait"", the drizzly synth lead clashes badly with the drums, while the centerpiece ""Be the Dancer Be the Dreamer"" sets itself up to be one of those epic White Rainbow corkers but ends up twiddling its thumbs between tip-toeing around and trying to break out into a bigger dance number, while Forkner's vocals fail to make much of an impression at all.</p>
<p>The album's second half slows down to a gentler place. ""Plane 2 Sea"" and ""Only 4 Us"" are bite-sized pop ditties with goofy vocals, and ""Touchdown"" is a lead-footed stomper with whiffs of the L.A. instrumental hip-hop scene. These tracks fare better than the experiments on the first half, but there's something inconsequential about them—it's almost like Forkner is joking around, an idea only reinforced by silly moments like the slapbass interlude ""Cuban Egg"". There's nothing wrong with artists taking themselves less seriously, but from an act who was responsible for emotional epics like ""Warm Clicked Fruit"", his particular brand of antidepressant is a hard one to swallow.</p>
<p><i>Thru.U</i> is disappointingly slight for a comeback album, but it's also a relief, because there are glimmers of the old brilliance in there. It just feels like he's having trouble expressing them. After the faux-80s ballad ""Terminator Failed"", Forkner brings the album to a glorious finish with the lengthy ""Screen Blind"", which builds over seven minutes of ecstatic synthesizer. It's one of the few tracks on the LP that retains the scope of his old work, but it's brushed and bevelled with a distinctly modern brightness—a hopeful reminder of his past triumphs, and enough to convince you that maybe he just needs some time to get back on his feet.</p></div>"|18983.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18983-white-rainbow-thruu/|6.0|Andrew Ryce

A slew of documentaries have, with varying degrees of delicacy, danced around the question: which came first, the scary music or the scary city? (The answer is obvious; the question, fruitless.) Meanwhile, consumers of this music—drill, the flinty, macabre Chicago street rap named for a colloquial term for murder—have occasionally danced around their own twinges of conscience: does championing art inextricably tied to a city’s gang infrastructure and homicide epidemic implicitly endorse its baggage? But to moralize drill is to miss the point: it’s radical not necessarily because of what its artist espouse, but because you can hear them at all.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still, after over a year of monopoly over the city’s rap scene, drill’s ubiquity threatened to neuter its potency. Things grew weird. And after the 1000th unwieldy Young Chop imitation, is it any wonder Keef cannonballed straight into the sound’s murky deep end post-Finally Rich? Out of the exhaust from the scene’s fission emerged, in essence, its antithesis: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/49-chicagos-bopping-scene/"">bop</a>, a chirpy, hyper-saturated romp through major keys and egregious Auto-Tune paired with a goofily swaggy (though no doubt athletic) dance. Incubated on Chicago’s west side in late 2012, popularized over last summer, and currently going <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3FE8-Pjoes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">national</a>, there are still relatively few comprehensive entry points to the sound, apart from savvy YouTubeing. Enter DJ Moondawg, one of the city’s premiere <a href=""http://www.wgci.com/onair/dj-moondawg-36555/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">radio</a> and mixtape DJs. You may have tried to block out his “Get in tune, stupid!” drops on tapes like Keef’s star-making <a href=""http://indy.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/16560/chief_keef_back_from_the_dead.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Back From The Dead”</a> and Lil Durk’s <a href=""http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/19152/lil-durk-life-aint-no-joke.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Life Ain’t No Joke”</a>, but his <i>We Invented the Bop</i> compilation is the scene’s first official survey on record.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Spanning from its infancy (hits like Stunt Taylor’s “Fefe On The Block” and “Fiesta,” one of bubbling duo Sicko Mobb’s first records) to just-surfaced exclusives (a pair of tracks from promising newcomer King Deazel and “What to Do”, a delirious new cut from mainstay Lil Chris), the movement’s roughly year-long history is concisely but thoroughly mapped over the tape’s 13 tracks. There are transformations over time, most notably with <a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Sicko-Mobb-Super-Saiyan-Vol-1-mixtape.565977.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sicko Mobb</a>, bop’s weirdest and quickest-rising act (they recently signed with Stargate’s Sony/ATV imprint). “Fiesta”, a twangy, tinny, blues-inflected bit of alien ringtone rap, sounds miles away production-wise from their latest, “Zoom Zoom”, on which they fully realize their pop potential without sacrificing too much of the frenzy. But overall, the sound is consistent: Auto-Tune-drenched sing-raps, a fixation with melody often evocative of nursery rhymes, aggressively bright synths, frantic percussion. On first listen, it’s slightly jarring, verging on campy. But its DNA is familiar: the garbled romanticism and extreme vocal manipulations of contemporary Atlanta, where Future is king; the experimental physicality of Chicago dance music from house to juke to footwork; the meme-friendly grassroots nature of regional dance trends from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv9VKKXwVxU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">jerking</a> to the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBi8dlTHPng"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nae nae</a>; melodic, triumphant mid-2000s swag rap. In particular, Soulja Boy’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-gYOd_MAfk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Zan With That Lean Pt. 1”</a> and F.L.Y.’s 2009 “Jamboree” album (yeah, the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iTsbnr8e_8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Swag Surfin”</a> dudes) contain much of bop’s blueprint.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Those in search of lyrical miracles can quit while they’re ahead: there’s little to be found in the way of “bars” here. Even from a quick scan of the explicitly dance-party-centric titles (“fefe,” short for fiesta, is the scene’s preferred term for party), it’s clear the aim is an escape from the cerebral, a celebration of the body and spirit. As with most dance-friendly swag rap, the songs can feel fluffy, their utilitarian lyrics primarily directing or detailing the turn-up and little else; “Kemo Step” and “Dlow Shuffle” are purely instructional, a new generation of DIY <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb6pJ4AEOoI&amp;noredirect=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cha Cha Slides</a>. In fact, it makes more sense to consider the tape as an exhibition of dance music as much as rap music, particularly as the logical evolution of footwork warped from saturation in a rap-centric environment (as evidenced by bop <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0vebi56kRQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">forefather</a> DJ Nate’s transformation from spazzy footwork ingenue to rap-crooner). As such, dancing, fucking, and bacchanalia aren’t filler content: they’re the entire point. Often, near-oppressive vocal processing blurs words into indecipherable jumbles—after 15 listens, I’m without a clue as to what the hook of “Zoom Zoom” says at all—but semantics are unnecessary here. As with much of the melody-obsessed, experimental young Atlanta rap (and, increasingly, with Keef), the voice is a tool for conveying emotion rather than information. Across the board on the tape, that emotion is unadulterated jubilance. </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>We Invented the Bop</i> points to a different way to face the seriousness of “Chiraq” as it stands: playful, ecstatic, and sure, perhaps frivolous escapism. But the frivolous is endowed with a new sense of poignancy here. In a vacuum, it’s a 40-minute blast of Chicago’s funhouse-mirror answer to swag rap; in the context of Chicago’s South and West sides, it’s an active defiance of perpetuated violence; its aggressive positivity feels as vital now as Keef’s chronicles of nihilism did in 2012.</p></div>"|18988.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18988-we-invented-the-bop/|7.2|Meaghan Garvey

McGuire’s kaleidoscopic new LP, <i>Along the Way</i>, is, in some fashion, his post-Emeralds debut. It is, after all, his first album for Dead Oceans—a commercially accessible imprint that, after years of small experimental labels and self-releases for McGuire, might as well be a major. But before, during and after Emeralds’ steady rupture, McGuire has maintained an astonishing creative pace, appearing on nearly six <i>dozen</i> titles in about six years. Since the end of Emeralds, he’s recorded and released <i>Along the Way</i>, the hour-long <i>Tiding III</i>, and the playful <i>Active Imagination EP</i>, plus three reissues of earlier material. He just moved to Los Angeles with <a href=""http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/mark-mcguire-along-the-way#_"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the hope of being <i>more </i>productive.</a> McGuire lives, it seems, to make music.</p>
<p>Indeed, McGuire’s individual work has often bridged his instrumental virtuosity with a charming Midwestern sweetness, creating a personal workspace of skill and sentimentality. His records have often felt like momentary cocoons of memories, realms in which to get lost and simply ponder one’s existence. The explosive “Brothers (for Matt)” closed 2010’s <i>Living with Yourself</i>. It opened with a cassette recording of Mark and younger brother Matt hanging out with their father as children before launched into ecstatic instrumental rock and ending with a tender reverie for acoustic guitar and windswept electronics. <a href=""http://markmcguire.bandcamp.com/album/the-sounds-of-xmas"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Sounds of Xmas</i></a>, a private Christmas collection initially intended only for friends and family, let gently crisscrossing guitars twinkle beneath home recordings of seasonal memories. Even when it’s 60 and sunny outside, it’s a fully operational time machine into childhood.</p>
<p><i>Along the Way </i>is an apogee of this dual approach to music. Again, McGuire cuts moments of his past, such as a tape recording of a “roast” of his father by friends from 1989, into complex musical webs. McGuire wrote, played, and produced everything here, stepping beyond his usual guitar tessellations to add keyboards and mandolin, drum machines and hand drums, vocals and noise. It is a meticulous solo rendering of a full band’s effort—and deservedly so, as <i>Along the Way</i> work as much as an empirical field guide for life as it does a mere album. In addition to the 13-track, 68-minute set, McGuire includes a nearly 8,000-word series of lyrics, essays, and acknowledgements that position this music as a sonic parable. “This is the story that turns in the heart of all mankind,” he writes, “the quest of the individual seeking the answers to the great mysteries of life.” The text follows a character from birth into the confusion of adolescence and the worry of young adulthood, where he realizes that the institutions of the world are gaining purchase of his ideas, honesty, and expression. The hero eventually ascends to “The Palace of Self”, hoping he (McGuire favors the male pronoun, perhaps as a matter of autobiographical self-reflection) might overcome those obstacles and wait for others to join. That story is the guiding force behind the album, as McGuire turns his prose into elliptical poetry that he coos like a phantom throughout the record.</p>
<p>Accompanied as it is by a philosophical treatise and song-by-song pontification, <i>Along the Way</i> runs the risk of seeming didactic. When your liner notes include sagas divided into parts divided into Romanized subsections and phrases such as “psychic predators,” “interpersonal chaos,” and “the magic underlying life,” the ideals undergirding the music threaten to overrun the music itself. Certainly, <i>Along the Way </i>bends somewhat to the will of the narrative its notes espouse: Opener “The Awakening” feels like a sunrise, and closer “Turiya (The Same Way)” suggests a Ratatat-ready celebration of what’s been learned. The 12-minute “The Instinct” unfurls a rather literal rendering of its accompanying drama. “The individual does not flinch, and rides right into the heart of the beast,” writes McGuire of his hero, who has emerged from his own Plato’s Cave, prepared to lash away the world’s constraints. The music suggests <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP3MFBzMH2o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">every <i>Rocky </i>training montage ever</a>, collectively soundtracked by Manuel Göttsching’s<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUiA0UOKIlc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i> E2–E4</i></a>. And both “The Human Condition (Song for My Father)” and “For the Friendships (Along the Way)” include not just long cassette recordings of the characters their titles name but also enough major chords, incandescent harmonies, and bounding rhythms to convey the character’s slow, hopeful evolution. When the text says smile, <i>Along the Way</i> absolutely beams.</p>
<p>McGuire, however, seems too concerned with personal transcendence to closely follow the tale he outlines, especially when it involves existential anxiety or despair. Just before the record’s midpoint, for instance, the protagonist realizes that religion is a lie, that power systems are evil, and that his wisdom is inherited—essentially, he goes to a liberal arts college, discovers the bottom end of a bowl, and drops out to find himself. Aside from gobs of distorted bass and chord patterns that don’t always resolve, though, the supposedly troubled portions of the narrative still sound hopeful, as though McGuire’s chosen one knows enough to push ahead. For all the darkness McGuire suggests, he rarely pulls it into the sounds. That’s something of an easy way out, right, softening the story until the album feels more like a breezy mixtape than a document of personal crisis? It’s not exactly what Beethoven would have done.</p>
<p>But both on the page and in speakers, <i>Along the Way</i> demands a certain suspension of cynicism or, perhaps more exactly, a willingness to accept the world the way someone else has come to see it. The same new-age principles that drip through McGuire’s passionately constructed sentences and gently rendered lyrics ripple through the music, too—those neon-green guitar lines and Sunday morning piano themes, arms-outstretched synthesizer lines and B-movie action sequence drums. It’s earnest enough to be called goofy, a vacuum of irony that revels in what McGuire might kabel “the possibility of an endless string of opportunities and destinations.” That guru-like sense of wonder might push some away, especially those interested in the dexterous marathons McGuire made with Emeralds or under his own name. There’s no chest-puffing here, no braggadocio; this is only the very sincere statement of a person doing his best to work through the worries of living and share any delight he’s stumbled upon along the way.    </p></div>"|18939.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18939-mark-mcguire-along-the-way/|7.9|Grayson Haver Currin

Previously stringy and pale, the song is now brawny and dark. The bass line, once a bubbling throwback to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a>’s “Walked in Line”, has become a flood of sludge. Drums and guitar claw at each other. And the vocals seep through the sour atmosphere like a poisonous fog. An entire dimension has been added to it—and the same can be said of Have a Nice Life as a whole.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Founded by core members Dan Barrett and Tim Macuga, Have a Nice Life came on strong with their 2008 debut, <i>Deathconsciousness</i>, then seemed to retreat in the face of an imminent breakthrough. It’s taken six years to issue a proper follow-up, but their central message hasn’t changed: Existence is bleak, gallows humor undergirds it, and sometimes wallowing in that sick paradox is the best revenge. But instead of sporting the sort of smart-ass song titles found on <i>Deathconsciousness</i> (“Holy Fucking Shit: 40,000”, “Waiting for Black Metal Records to Come in the Mail”), <i>The Unnatural World</i> submerges most of the duo’s bitter irony, or at least the irony, leaving nothing but the bitter.</p>
<p class=""p1"">For all its unrelenting gloom, <i>The Unnatural World</i> oozes beauty. On “Burial Society”, a rolling blackout of congealed noise only barely clothes a sumptuous, lonesome vocal melody—one that’s as full of rage as it is resignation. Smothered in sorrow, “Guggenheim Wax Museum” plods and throbs in time with some cosmic, cancerous organ. Hints of shoegaze gauziness and industrial pneumatics float through “Unholy Life”, even as “Dan and Tim, Reunited by Fate” bypasses what would appear to be cheeky self-mythology in favor of dour, murky balladry. When the track’s skeletal tangle of beats and static finally disintegrates, all that’s left is hellish echo.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">“Cropsey”, named after Staten Island’s eerie, mad-slasher urban legend, opens with an even more chilling sample: testimony from a young boy named Johnny, an inmate of the notoriously abusive Pennsylvania mental institution Pennhurst that was featured in the 1968 exposé <i>Suffer the Little Children</i>. Accordingly, the song’s spiraling synths and ghostly wails evoke stolen innocence, nerve-deadened dread, and cries for a rescue that may never come. Rather than feeling like morbid exploitation, “Crospey” slowly morphs into a goth-dub uproar that tears loose a heart of tenderness and empathy. Hope, however, is still nowhere in sight.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The album’s matched pair of drumless tracks, “Music Will Untune the Sky” and “Emptiness Will Eat the Witch”, are equal parts brooding interlude and mocking reprieve. They hover over the rest of the songs like an unspoken, fatalistic threat—an ominous horizon that can’t be escaped from. Where fellow travelers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28699-the-soft-moon/"" target=""_blank"">the Soft Moon</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28171-cold-cave/"" target=""_blank"">Cold Cave</a> religiously exult in the darkwave tradition, Have a Nice Life use <i>The Unnatural World</i> to distance themselves from any kind of retroactive pull. Sinuous instead of rigid, bloody instead of embalmed, the album refuses to be frozen in time or place. Instead it moves, and moves others with it.</p></div>"|18828.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18828-have-a-nice-life-the-unnatural-world/|7.8|Jason Heller

The bucolic, oceanside city of nearly 100,000 is slow-paced, homogenous, and affluent—and since it’s near wine country rather than Orange County, it lacks the stifling suburbia that can generate great punk music as a response. It’s a college town as well, but UC-Santa Barbara ain’t exactly Berkeley in terms of fostering counterculture and political awareness; <a href=""http://www.independent.com/news/2013/aug/06/ucsb-ranked-2-party-school-country/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">it’s known as one of America’s premiere party schools</a>. As such, here’s the complete list of notable bands emerging from Santa Barbara since 1990: Toad the Wet Sprocket, Dishwalla, Sugarcult, and now, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29675-gardens-villa"">Gardens &amp; Villa</a>, all acts that tread a similar path. (I’m not necessarily using that as an insult.)</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29675-gardens-villa/"" target=""_blank"">Gardens &amp; Villa</a> sound nothing like the aforementioned, they just happen to run parallel to them, orbiting a very centrist “left-of-center” sound predominantly defining a post-collegiate demographic. What the first three were to their year’s version of khaki-clad alt-rock, Gardens &amp; Villa are to widely available, synthesizer-heavy, kinda naturalistic pop that still gets called “indie rock.” Meaning if the popularity of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house"">Beach House</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28094-washed-out"">Washed Out</a> was gauged by appearances on MTV and rock radio rather than their font on festival banners, Gardens &amp; Villa would likely get some spins as well.  </p>
<p>But how many? The quintet's second album <i>Dunes</i> found them recording in rural Michigan rather than their hometown as a means of avoiding complaceny and sounds more pointedly “pop” than their 2011 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15603-gardens-villa/"">self-titled debut</a>. And yet, you can’t take the Santa Barbara out of the band, as <i>Dunes</i> once again shows Gardens &amp; Villa orbiting around the center of discussion at a safe distance, suffering from what befalls the countless populist indie bands running the same route: the affliction of “good enough.”</p>
<p>If you’re pressed to do so, you can describe Chris Lynch‘s vocals and lyrics in a number of kind ways: the former lilting, purified, androgynous, the latter vaguely spiritual, slightly poetic. The one thing you wouldn’t describe either of them as is “distinctive.” Similarly, while <i>Dunes</i> has melodies and choruses, you wouldn’t call it “melodic” or “hooky.” Opener “Domino” is the standout on account of Lynch avoiding the orderly fall of its titular object, the chorus melody going from note to note in the motion of swinging on a set of monkey bars. Otherwise, <i>Dunes</i> prefers to let the listener latch onto unusual words and ones with cool phonetics (“Minnesota”, “Thunder Glove”, “Chrysanthemums”).</p>
<p><i>Dunes</i> boasts production from DFA’s Tim Goldsworthy, and while his imprimatur isn’t what it used to be, give him credit for ensuring Gardens &amp; Villa keep things varied and in motion. I wouldn’t say it has “grooves” or anything you’d call danceable, though “Bullet Train” is more slinky than your average indie band making it a point to let you know they, like damn near everyone, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince"">Prince</a>. On the other hand, their access to Goldsworthy’s trove of vintage gear can result in puffy slow-jams like “Purple Mesas” that stop <i>Dunes</i> dead in its tracks.  </p>
<p>And so this tidy, 10-song collection ends up inspiring the kind of light criticism that calls for the phrase so often accompanying the affliction of “good enough”<i>—none of this means it’s a bad album</i>. Of course it’s not—it’s good enough. But even if the current state of “indie rock” means more visibility for a band like Gardens &amp; Villa than they ever would’ve received in the 1990s, as the saying goes, a rising tide lifts all ships. Think about how you might have encountered a minute-long sample of “Domino” two decades ago—if you randomly heard it at a Sam Goody’s, knowing nothing about who made it, would you ask one of the clerks? Possibly, even if you might forget it the moment you step outside towards the Structure or Babbage's. If a trusted friend lent you <i>Dunes</i> and it was certain to be one of the maybe 30 albums you listened to all year, could it eventually win you over? Perhaps.</p>
<p>But <i>Dunes</i> lives in 2014 and its main concern isn’t competing with the incapacitating amount of music that has nothing to do with it. It’s that they’re one of many bands following this particular path and <i>Dunes</i>’ best hope is that you haven’t heard any of them yet. Judging from the tone of Lynch’s vocals, affable songwriting and studied arrangements, it’s not hard to imagine them starting out back in 2008 as a folkier indie-pop contemporary of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5932-ra-ra-riot"">Ra Ra Riot</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5110-the-ruby-suns/"">the Ruby Suns</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10902-the-morning-benders"">the Morning Benders</a>, who also made <i>their</i> synth-y pop records recently with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17517-christopher/"">middling</a>-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17513-beta-love/"">to</a>-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16718-pop-etc"">god awful</a> results. The good news is that if you shuffled those four albums together in a blind listening test, the songs on<i> Dunes</i> would be best of the lot. The bad news is that most of them sound like the work of the same exact band, so is that kind of “good enough” really enough?</p></div>"|18919.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18919-gardens-villa-dunes/|6.2|Ian Cohen

Take the band out of that Paris scene and you could just as easily be looking at a Dan Deacon show, with sweaty bodies elatedly dancing and flying all over the place. Close your eyes for a minute, and David Lemoine's shouted vocals, which are manipulated by machines, could be mistaken for MC Ride's. Factor in that show's opening act—Tyvek—and you start to get a loose frame of reference for this band's M.O.: scrappy garage punk, belligerent percussion, textural chaos, primary colored synth oddities, and perhaps most importantly, lyrics with absurd narratives and a sense of humor. All of those things came into play on their debut, and even though they added ornate string arrangements on their 2011 follow-up <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15237-1000/"">1000</a></i>, Cheveu were still erratic, scattered, and just a little bit ridiculous.</p>
<p>Their third album,<i> BUM</i>, is an unpredictable record, but it's perhaps their most delicately arranged. The best example of this is ""Polonia"", which opens with gentle drum machine taps, soft guitars, and quiet, warm vocal harmonies. At six minutes, it's the longest track on the album, and around the minute mark, they kick up the sort of minor key urgency you hear just before a Nintendo boss fight. Like they do through the rest of <i>BUM</i>, the trio explore vocal textures—deep rumbling ""mum mum mum"" voices and staccato stabs of soprano ""ah ah ah""s. It's an epic melodrama, and it's fairly indicative of what they offer throughout<i>. </i>Sure, there's still gutter punk, which they demonstrate with the distorted guitars that introduce ""Albinos"". But it's not long before they curb that sound with high-pitched synths. Even Lemoine's greasy, deep vocals dissipate into a glowing, beatific sheen.</p>
<p>It may be fair to say that <i>BUM</i> is the album where Cheveu have cleaned up their sound the most, but just because the fidelity's improved doesn't mean they can't tap into impressive grooves. ""Slap and Shot"" has motorik drive and ""Pirate Bay"" rides a Squeeze-ian new wave jaunt. ""Juan in a Million"" features an organ and tinges of sunny instrumentals (including a triangle). That track also finds the band's sense of humor intact, with <i>so </i>many Juan-based puns (""Juan for all and all for Juan"") and an awesomely anticlimactic monologue: ""You know, Juan is good friends with everyone. Yeah. Good friends. Yup."" Later, on ""Stadium"", there's a grand, stomping instrumental that accompanies a decree about the importance of masturbation.</p>
<p>In the best case scenario, their theatricality results in something like ""Polonia"", a well-crafted and consistently interesting sprawl. At times, though, that inclination takes them into tedious territory. ""Juan"", for example, becomes repetitive near the end. Worse is the ultra-pitched down deep voices on ""Madame Pompidou"", a too-long ""spooky"" track that could be convincingly branded as a grating outtake from <i>The Nightmare Before Christmas</i>. </p>
<p>That's ultimately the blessing and the curse of <i>BUM</i>. It's an album where there's so much going on that when a joke falls flat or any sonic element registers as dubious or obnoxious, it's easy to get disenchanted with its overstuffed format. But then there are beautiful moments, like the final seconds of ""Monsieur Perrier"", when the trio pare the song down to its most basic elements: an array of cuckooing voices (formerly frantic, but when unaccompanied, oddly lovely) and a simple melody plunked out on a piano. Cheveu have made an album that's constantly shifting but never quite cacophonous. They've clearly got a good ear for melody and drive, and they never threaten stagnation. Right as a song's nearing monotony, they'll quickly change the rhythm or implement an entirely new soundscape. The album is frequently surprising and never boring. Put another way: It's a Cheveu album.</p></div>"|19004.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19004-cheveu-bum/|6.6|Evan Minsker

For all the talk of treatises and transcendentalism, Fox was Liturgy’s locomotive, powering their metal with his relentless and intricate drumming. <a href=""http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2011/09/greg_fox_leaves.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fox hasn’t been in the band since October 2011</a>, but the association is just now, at last, beginning to peel from his side.</p>
<p>In large part, Fox’s name has begun to hold sway without that former association because he’s just so goddamn busy—the aforementioned are only a sample of his manifold projects since leaving Liturgy. More important than accretion, though, has been the excellence of his Guardian Alien, the wild-eyed, open-ended troupe that emerged just before Fox split with Liturgy. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30534-guardian-alien/"" target=""_blank"">Guardian Alien</a> couples Alexandra Drewchin’s spasmodic vocals and electronics and Turner Williams’ electrified Indian zither, the <i>shahai baaja</i>, with a daunting power trio—Fox on drums, surrounded by bassist Eli Winograd, and former Liturgy guitarist Bernard Gann. Their debut LP, the one track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16890-see-the-world-given-to-a-one-love-entity/"" target=""_blank""><i>See the World Given to a One Love Entity</i></a>, recalled Fox’s recent past only through the force of the rhythms—primal, knotty cataracts spilling over refracted dub and jazz, noise and abstraction. It was a primer for Guardian Alien’s broad musical reach, suggesting a group whose interests were as wide as the psychedelic sky above. It was, in earnest, the start of Fox’s post-Liturgy liberation, a process that reaches its next phase with a pair of new LPs—Guardian Alien’s near-brilliant second LP, <i>Spiritual Emergency</i>, and <i>Mitral Transmission</i>, a wonderful and ponderous collaboration between Fox and jazz pioneer Milford Graves.    </p>
<p><i>Spiritual Emergency</i> follows the noble freak/free music tradition of pitting one or several sides of short takes against one sidelong epic. The album’s first half links four divergent improvisations, while Guardian Alien commits the flip to an extended, excited span that starts near silence and ends in paroxysmal explosion. The structural decision places Guardian Alien in an idiomatic continuum that includes <a href=""http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=34310"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Coltrane</a>, <a href=""http://www.espdisk.com/official/catalog/1025.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Patty Watters</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freak_Out!"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Frank Zappa</a>, <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-jackson-in-your-house-mw0000265590"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Art Ensemble of Chicago</a>, and <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/album/phallus-dei-mw0000050535"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amon Düül II</a>. It also spotlights the band’s admirable willingness to tinker with most anything: That first side includes a duet for chopped-and-stacked samples and percussion that might recall the Books and an electric guitar drone that stretches and then drifts into the distance, like Bardo Pond on a lunch break. “Mirror” is a drum-and-noise tirade that mirrors <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2481-lightning-bolt/"" target=""_blank"">Lightning Bolt</a>, while opener “Tranquilizer” bounds between rhythms and samples, effects and instruments like a warm-up jam from the salad days of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1831-gang-gang-dance/"" target=""_blank"">Gang Gang Dance</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"" target=""_blank"">Black Dice</a>. That tizzy of activity and references, mind you, happens in an erratic 20 minutes—not enough time for any of the ideas to congeal into something greater or for the pieces to feel like more than loose leaves from the Guardian Alien’s collective notebook. Momentarily intriguing but never quite transfixing, they are exercises in exercising.</p>
<p>Their slightness comes in bas-relief to the audacious title track, the new pinnacle of Guardian Alien’s limited output. “Spiritual Emergency” begins with a reading by Stanislav Grof from <i>Spiritual Emergency: When Personal Transformation Becomes A Crisis</i>, a book that argues for working <i>through</i> freak-outs of faith rather than treating them like mental illness. Guardian Alien takes the idea as precept here, rising and falling in and out of momentum and confusion. They struggle to keep the rhythm and find the groove, to build from basic ideas into something grand. Drewchin’s voice drifts like a ghoulish invocation. Gann winds through the hyperactivity with a sterling desert-blues riffs, daring the quintet to follow him into the distance. They do for a bit, idling into a land of jam-band torpor just ahead of the 16-minute mark. But it’s a feint: All at once, the band bursts forward, drums and voices and guitars surging into the ecstasy of volume. It’s a new peak for Guardian Alien, a breakthrough that shows their ability to be mutually focused and wild, composed and chaotic. It’s exhilarating, liberating stuff, a deserving entry in the sidelong canon it follows.</p>
<p>As with “Spiritual Emergency”, <i>Mitral Transmission </i>succeeds because of its singular direction and focus. For years, Milford Graves—the border-defiant drummer, medicine man, scientist, and theoretician who played on many ESP Disk albums that shape Guardian Alien’s larger aesthetic—has recorded and analyzed the heart beats of musicians in his Queens basement laboratory. “His heart research can help anyone,” <a href=""http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/trends/columns/cityside/5380/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote <i>New York</i>’s Mark Jacobson in 2001</a>, “but mostly he works on musicians, ‘so they hear how they sound naturally, let them compare that with what they’re playing.’” Graves invited Fox into his lair for one of these sessions, connecting him to sensors and software that allowed Fox to listen to the beat and pitch of his own body. He used that data as the basis for <i>Mitral Transmission</i>’s four compositions, wondrous instrumentals that fascinate with or without their biosynthetic context.   </p>
<p>These tracks float occasionally toward the negative connotations of “new age music,” with long stretches of steel drum radiance, plucked harp patterns, softly pattered rhythms, and nebulous tones that suggest a breeze across a meadow. But the music’s too busy and prickly for somnolence. Just when the motion starts to settle, Fox adds a brief shock of noise or a new trace of rhythm to upset the system ever so slightly. “Heartbeat cycles with asymmetrical time values are more healthy,” <a href=""http://shamanicdrumming.com/taking_rhythm_to_heart.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Graves once told </a><i><a href=""http://shamanicdrumming.com/taking_rhythm_to_heart.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wavelength Magazine</a>.</i> “This asymmetry is called the chaotic heartbeat.” Fox’s interlocking meters and melodies shape a pinwheel sort of gamelan, spinning forever into new moments of wonder. Less esoteric than its origins suggest, the music lands somewhere between an acoustic recasting of Four Tet’s coruscant electronica and Matmos’ alien-but-accessible trip.</p>
<p><i>Mitral Transmission </i>is a fascinating album, then, a would-be footnote that reveals Fox’s willingness to mine most anything for sound. Sometimes, as on the first half of <i>Spiritual Emergency</i>, that process can lead to messy results. But elsewhere, it’s the power pushing Guardian Alien and Fox past their past associations and into a wonderfully strange and unpredictable future. </p></div>"|18871.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18871-guardian-alien-greg-fox-spiritual-emergency-mitral-transmission/|6.2|Grayson Haver Currin

That would be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8826-fabulous-muscles/""><i>Fabulous Muscles</i></a>, which placed Stewart's NC-17 lyrical deviance within the context of streamlined, not-<i>quite</i> pop songs and, as a result, gave us something more unsettling than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8825-a-promise/"">his cover art</a>—a Xiu Xiu record presumably meant for mass consumption. It’s remained his most accessible work and not coincidentally, his strongest. But its bold extroversion has also made it an outlier amongst his overall oeuvre: in the time since, individual Xiu Xiu songs have been shocking, disgusting, catchy, affecting, and kinda hilarious. But taking the longview, the project itself has become kinda predictable. Or at least reliable, as Xiu Xiu albums of nearly equal quality arrive to nearly equally positive reviews like clockwork—if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8827-la-foret/"" target=""_blank""><i>La Forêt</i></a> or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9416-the-air-force/"">The Air Force</a></i> didn’t convince you, I don’t see how <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11091-women-as-lovers/""><i>Women As Lovers</i></a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16378-always/""><i>Always</i></a> were going to do the trick. Point being that Xiu Xiu still makes potent, interesting art. The unconverted just need a new way in.</p>
<p><i>Angel Guts: Red Classroom</i>acknowledges that possibility, bearing the promise of being the most dark and bleak Xiu Xiu album, but those claims read like ""new tastier recipe!"" on a can of Chunky Soup: an unquantifiable way of enhancing what it was supposed to be in the first place. You won’t mistake <i>Angels Guts</i> as the work of anyone else, but after a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18762-xiu-xiu-nina/"">curiously tame Nina Simone covers album</a>, Stewart wisely places himself in the lineage of depraved art-rock titans equally drawn to literal and figurative human bondage. He opened for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans"">Swans</a> during their tour for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16964-the-seer/""><i>The Seer</i></a>, which is a tremendous cosign: you need to be antagonistic and artistically pure enough to appeal to Michael Gira, but you also need the balls to open for the most intimidating live band on earth playing an autoharp by yourself. Stewart acquitted himself tremendously and Thor Harris returns the favor by contributing percussion to <i>Angel Guts</i>, most notably the bells on “El Naco” which recall his own work on the doomsaying “Avatar”. On a macro level, you might hear <i>Angel Guts</i> capturing the same juxtaposition of dissonance, decaying beauty, and eerie calm of <i>The Seer </i>and condensing it into three-minute pieces on its instrumental bookends.</p>
<p>While Stewart’s more-emo-than-emo, hypothermic quavering is as <i>sui generis</i> as ever, you can also hear echoes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker"">Scott Walker</a>’s defiled operatics during the dramatic rise of “Stupid in the Dark” and “A Knife in the Sun”. Most often, you hear <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide"">Suicide</a>; for people who weren't ""there"" the first time around and only know them as a namedrop, that means a twisted metal cacophony of rudimentary drum machines, industrial squealing, and hypnotic synth lines. Co-opting that sound makes you no more outre than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9248-sky-ferreira/"">Sky Ferreira</a>, though the metallic poisoning pervades the entirety of<i> Angel Guts </i>rather than one song, making subtle diversions even more challenging to spot: avian swoops punctuating the nearly psychedelic “Lawrence Liquors,” “Adult Friends”’s juddering techno, even calypso during “Bitter Melon”.</p>
<p>Of course, if we’re going to talk about the “bleakest” Xiu Xiu album to date, it’s probably going to be a result of the lyrics. You won’t be disappointed. As far as the source of <i>Angel Guts: Red Classroom</i>'s title, I hate to quote the press release, but we’d be better off assuming neither of us has previously seen the “Japanese erotic noir” film of the same name, which explored “racialized sex, double suicide, double penetration, criminality, fear of physical harm.” You know, like a Xiu Xiu album. This is most likely the inspiration behind “Black Dick”, which could’ve also been called “white ass,” “yellow titties”, or “brown pussy,” except Stewart chose the one lyric that makes for the most Xiu Xiu-ian chorus: “black DICK! DICK! DICK! DICK! DICK!” On first glance, it’s more eye-rolling or “shocking” than actually shocking, giving you the impression that Stewart is simply playing to type. Of course, he knows this and manages to be pretty funny about it during the whole thing, describing the accoutrements of the aforementioned as “one cheek like Jesus/ the other like <i>Hey-Zeus</i>,” and “one ball like a skull/ the other ball like <a href=""http://www.mariowiki.com/Bullet_Bill"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bullet Bill</a>,” so now you have to grasp the dichotomy of Stewart juggling Japanese ""Roman porno"" fare and Super Mario Wii on a Friday night.</p>
<p>The laughs aren’t new, nor are they isolated, as “Cinthya’s Unisex” and “Adult Friends” actually find Stewart’s horrifyingly grim outlook appropriate for the subject of aging and desperate hookups, although spiked with the requisite S&amp;M  (“you reduced your breasts to a more tasteful size D/ when I touch them it is like a lobster crawling under my arm”). What does constitute a new wrinkle is  the physical sense of place, as opposed to the general squalor pervading Xiu Xiu’s music. Though the sounds and themes of <i>Angel Guts</i> gives one the impression of New York in the “glorious shithole” 80s, it’s actually Stewart’s “Los Angeles album,” as he recently relocated across the country after four years in North Carolina. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But this isn’t like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars/"">Liars</a>’ <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13991-sisterworld/"">Sisterworld</a></i>, a cultural critique from a cantankerous transplant. Stewart drew inspiration from a gang-infested, horrifying part of Los Angeles he “unwittingly” moved to, reflected in the true crime stories of “Stupid In The Dark” and the poisoned hysterics of “El Naco” (“ants in the kimchi!/a worm in my stool!”). And yet, something about his plausible deniability gets to why <i>Angel Guts</i> can prick the surface without getting under your skin. How could he not know what he was getting into? We’re talking about a touring musician who has the curiosity to find the deepest recesses of Japanese erotic noir, you don’t think he could check Westside Rentals?</p>
<p>As a result, <i>Angel Guts</i> can occasionally feel like stunt journalism, and you wonder how much skin Stewart has in the game, so to speak. Or whether the move really sparked much new at all: the apocalyptic suicide fantasy of “New Life Immigration” feels like a continuation of <i>Fabulous Muscles</i>’ “Little Panda McElroy”, yet another Xiu Xiu love song that essentially expresses the emotion as “I hate everyone but you,” which is, in fact, a lyric from “Cinthya’s Unisex.”</p>
<p>Which is to say that <i>Angel Guts</i> is yet another strong, occasionally frustrating record restrained by Stewart’s consistency. Xiu Xiu albums feel <i>safe</i>, not in the sense of being conservative, but protective—a place where you can shout “black DICK! DICK! DICK! DICK!” without any sense of judgment or risk, even if you don’t know why you're doing so in the first place. And that can be a little disappointing, considering how vital Stewart can and should be. Outcasts surely discover Xiu Xiu every year, and he’s become a touchstone for his peers—he’s collaborated with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9744-creepshow/"">Grouper</a>, been covered by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52971-video-shearwater-i-luv-the-valley-oh-xiu-xiu-cover/"">Shearwater</a>, acknowledged as a main influence by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28685-perfume-genius"">Perfume Genius</a>, and you can hear echoes of his confrontational, confessional songwriting in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28739-baths/"">Baths</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18065-baths-obsidian/""><i>Obsidian</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30868-majical-cloudz/"">Majical Cloudz</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18042-majical-cloudz-impersonator"">Impersonator</a>, </i>two of last year's most unique and compelling singer-songwriter records. But those artists are bringing the drama to an audience who might not otherwise expect it, and that feels more daring than <i>Angel Guts</i>, which comes off like a closed circuit, another satisfying way to meet Stewart on his own terms. He’s even better when he tries to meet us halfway.</p></div>"|18863.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18863-xiu-xiu-angel-guts-red-classroom/|6.6|Ian Cohen

The ferocious decibels flooded the narrow upstairs gallery, and its wooden floorboards quaked as the audience, excited to be so close to an indie-famous band, bounced in response. But while most of what I can recall of Deerhunter's set is a bone-rattling roar, an unknown opening act left a much sharper impression. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31699-mas-ysa/"">Mas Ysa</a>—pronounced something like ""mass EE-sah,"" his manager told me that night—is the moniker of Thomas Arsenault, born in Montreal but now based in New York. He was playing one of his very first shows outside Brooklyn, and he had yet to release a stitch of music, not even a stray demo online.</p>
<p>At the Carrack, Arsenault stood inside an archipelago of hardware, microphone in hand, and with minimal overt showmanship, he used them to confidently command a roughly half-hour set. Dark-haired, dressed simply in a white t-shirt and cuffed jeans, he had a mutedly striking presence—a hint of the emo heartthrob, a hint of Fugazi-like reserve. His sturdy stature conveyed coiled power, anchoring the nervous urgency of his music, which moved seamlessly between 80s synth-pop and contemporary techno or indie electronic styles. He wove together volatile vocal-led anthems with refreshing ambient and post-classical interludes. The music had something of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4683-xiu-xiu/"">Xiu Xiu's</a> attenuated warble, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"">M83's</a> world-beating drive, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28685-perfume-genius/"">Perfume Genius'</a> insomniac emotion. But mostly, it introduced a new artist of uncommon definition and focus, an impression strengthened by how closely this impressive debut EP replicates the feel and flow of the live set.</p>
<p>First came the single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16035-mas-ysa-why/"">""Why""</a> last fall, which shows off one side of Arsenault with its anxiously propulsive drum programming, cramped synth lines, and hooky vocal tantrums. It was followed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16558-years/"">""Years""</a> last month, which shows off the opposite side. Arsenault's wounded voice fills a cavernous space sketched out with loose, slow bass and a distant mirage of bowed strings, which lift into a gentle threnody at the end, like the unrelenting turn of a nightmare. It's the same kind of eloquent instrumental gesture that Arsenault uses between longer songs to inflate the EP to generous proportions, and for once, interstitial doesn't mean skippable. These little dreams for gamelan-like tuned metal or pitch-shifting piano feel individual rather than desultory; my only complaint about something like ""Vanya"", a darkly lustrous braid of low wind instruments and bright drones that rivals <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Colin+Stetson"">Colin Stetson</a>, is that it stops after only a minute.</p>
<p>The gulf in tone between ""Why"" and ""Years"", which lie near the beginning and at the end of the record, is filled in not onlywith these fine shades, but also with a couple songs that reach the emphatic heights of the singles. ""Shame"" is a convulsive avalanche with outpouring vocals in the vein of ""Why"", though it differentiates itself with an intensely angular rather than linear thrum. ""Life Way Up From"" mirrors the atmospheric ""Years"" but is even more vivid, especially when weird, whorled synth colors start shining through the glassy blocks of the melody as the song proceeds. The diversity is smoothed over by the specter of Arsenault's attention, which presides with a quiet gravity, a resistance to error and chance. He precisely executes his musical ideas and leaves the bloodletting to his lyrics, faintly petulant spasms of romantic denunciation and guilt. Mas Ysa was definitely the biggest suprise about Deerhunter's surprise show, and the strong follow-through of <i>Worth</i> should land his prospective first LP high on most-anticipated shortlists.       </p></div>"|18936.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18936-mas-ysa-worth-ep/|7.8|Brian Howe

These three terms are all in the same family of art-making, relying as they do on primary source artistic material—sometimes to make something new, sometimes to reveal hidden characteristics in an original work. But there’s an important distinction to be made between curating, remixing, and creating collages, and it is in moving along the spectrum that Potter has found his voice, as exemplified beautifully on the new EP <i>Deleted/Fool.</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">Jerome LOL has been identified as a representative of the Seapunk movement, a well-documented combination of 90s fashion, internet 1.0 imagery, early aughts R&amp;B, and house music. Two years ago, Seapunk (a style with which Potter has repeatedly said he never personally associated) was visible enough to gain recognition from <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/fashion/Seapunk-a-Web-Joke-With-Music-Has-Its-Moment.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The New York Times</i></a> and <i><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/14/seapunk-has-now-gone-pop"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Guardian</a></i>, if only so they could greet the movement with a kind of “look what the internet has belched up” bemusement. One of the early things that set Potter apart was his refusal to give in to the knee-jerk outrage that so often accompanies the mainstream’s swift co-opting of any happening subculture. Instead, <a href=""http://www.vice.com/my-life-online/the-web-10-music-of-jerome-lol"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he spoke intelligently</a> about the creative intention behind his art, using an incident in which <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/perpetua/web-artists-are-furious-at-rihanna-and-azealia-ban"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rihanna was said to have stolen his aesthetic</a> as a platform to introduce his music to a wider audience. </p>
<p class=""p1"">During his rise in 2011 and 2012, Potter released music as a member of the LOL Boys, alongside Markus Garcia, a collaborator whom he met on an online message board. But the two broke up in September 2012 to work on their solo careers, and the split has benefited Potter, allowing him to zero in on the sounds he’s interested in playing with. <i>Deleted/Fool</i> is a collection of R&amp;B tracks, punctuated with swirling dancehall rhythms and the dulcet California synths that Classixx used to such great effect on last year’s <i>Hanging Gardens. </i>The songs feature vocals from the Chicago singer Angelina Lucero, a former LOL boys favorite, as well as the vocalist and DJ Sara Zagarino. Zagarino, who appears here as Sara Z, is particularly noticeable on the EP’s first and catchiest track, “Deleted”, her voice coolly inhabiting the spaces between mellow synths and an undeniable shuffling handclap, the kind that has powered other semi-anonymous singers (Lumidee, anyone?) to prominence.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The LOL boys’ allegiance was always to something like house music, though they were happy to explore, thinking of the genre as a foundation instead of a religion. Even the latter two tracks on <i>Deleted/Fool,</i> which more closely resemble house than their fellows, have a diversity of rhythm and sound that place them in the pop sphere. “Fool” plays with the beat constantly, pulling it out to replace it with rainbow-brite synths and adding coiling rhythms to the steady pounding bass. It’s important to note that none of these choices seem arbitrary: on the EP’s final track, “True”, Lucero’s voice comes in singing about “little voices” with a reticence that emphasizes the words, and the track continues to grow and shrink in direct relation to its lyrics.    </p>
<p class=""p1"">Potter is a denizen of the internet, so much so that in describing the first LOL boys tour he could say “we brought it into the irl-sphere” without sounding like he was making a joke. One of the small, fun touches on these tracks is the way that he reconciles life on a laptop with real emotion: the bridge on “Deleted” is formed of a series of commands (control, escape, command, delete) that evoke a person desperately trying to escape from something, either online or off. Listen closely to “Fool” and a couple of times you’ll hear something that sounds an awful lot like the Gchat alert sound. It’s a great touch in a song about a manipulative interpersonal relationship, as that sound can conjure up a Pavlovian response in anyone engaged in a particularly meaningful bit of online communication.</p>
<p class=""p1""> When young artists mostly known for collecting and remixing songs decide to make the leap to purely original music, the most difficult challenge often comes in forging a coherent sound.  Some, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31080-classixx/"" target=""_blank"">Classixx</a>, succeed by limiting themselves to a relatively narrow template. Others, as we saw with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30667-ryan-hemsworth/"" target=""_blank"">Ryan Hemsworth</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18670-ryan-hemsworth-guilt-trips/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Guilt Trips</a></i>, draw too much on what they know and end up with something slightly confused. The difference between curating and collage-making has to do with editing: the ability to say no and to pare a sound down to something essential. On <i>Deleted/Fool, </i>Jerome LOL shows himself to be a great fit for the curation-savvy, pop-minded label Friends of Friends, as an artist with both perspective and vision. But more importantly, when every conceivable sound and style is at his fingertips, Potter has a unique ability to know when to log off.  </p></div>"|18932.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18932-jerome-lol-deletedfool-ep/|7.5|Jonah Bromwich

In 2008, Sunn O))) played its 200th set in a park in Oslo, Norway, to a few thousand ear-burned listeners at the Øya festival. For the auspicious occasion, the band expanded into a transcontinental quintet, with the core of bassist Greg Anderson, guitarist Stephen O’Malley, ritualistic showman Attila Csihar, and an accompanying militia of amplifiers abutted by two guests, Norwegian electronics aggressor Lasse Marhaug and British multi-instrumentalist Daniel O’ Sullivan. “This is Sunn O)))’s 200th concert!” exclaimed <a href=""http://www2.sk-static.com/images/media/img/col6/20110107-162633-199220.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their stage plot for the big night</a> in one of metal’s motherlands. “We are very, very happy to be playing it in Norway! Thank you! Hail to Norway!”</p>
<p>To consecrate the event, two days later Ulver invited Anderson and O’Malley to Crystal Canyon, their longtime Oslo studio, to stay up late and improvise until the sun rose—two supposed pillars of darkness, creating a collective morning love song. The pairing made sense: Sunn O))) and Ulver have emerged sporadically but surely as <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=K3WNFheF9ycC&amp;pg=PT67&amp;lpg=PT67&amp;dq=coltrane+%22searching+musician%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9XLB9fv1NX&amp;sig=lzo8depRziqxsdkG4SJJ-zGI2HU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=b1HuUurjLIqrsQSexoCwDg&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=coltrane%20%22searching%20musician%22searching&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“searching musicians,”</a> the phrase that Robert Levin coined to describe John Coltrane’s essential artistic unrest in 1957. (O'Sullivan, Rygg, and O'Malley also play in the highly collaborative art-metal ensemble Aethenor.) Sure, Sunn O))) earned their initial cachet by dressing in robes and playing long, loud riffs through a macabre veil of fog. But their records are deeply experimental odysseys where choirs, orchestras, and harsh-noise masters enrich their typical amplifier worship. And during the last two decades, Ulver have moved from a black metal powerhouse into an outfit that have used electronica and theatrics to forge their own cutting edge. To wit, O’Sullivan, who joined these sessions after supporting Sunn O))) at Øya, has since become Ulver’s fourth member. His other projects include Grumbling Fur and Guapo, associations that reinforce Ulver’s beyond-metal charge.</p>
<p>Despite those résumés, the relatively bright sounds, open-ended structures and medium volume of the pleasant <i>Terrestrials</i> might still come as a surprise. After that initial session, O’Malley and Ulver frontman Kristoffer Rygg finessed the recordings, editing and assembling the jams into three sympathetic pieces, aided by strings and trumpet. The results step far afield of Sunn O)))’s generally infinite desolation and pull Ulver’s own stylistic wandering toward a center of static gravity.</p>
<p>The opener takes the name “Let There Be Light”, a de facto mantra for the tune and overall effort. These first 11 minutes, for instance, cycle through a dense bed of guitar sustains, trumpet curlicues, and violin trills until a drum roll introduces a marching-band-sized fanfare. With its plunging bass and vaulting melodies, the moment suggests the sun pictured on the album’s cover, at last climbing from the blanketing dark. On “Western Horn”, the shortest and most essential piece here, the ensemble builds patiently, with sinister guitars and torpid tones accreting during the first several minutes. But there’s a luminous undercurrent to this unlikely rendezvous of Miles Davis’ electric jazz surrealism and Sunn O)))’s fathom-deep drones. O’Sullivan’s coruscant keyboards and a trumpet extend vivid lines from beneath the din. It’s like staring into darkness so long that you imagine new flickers of light, a mirage of impending triumph. The 14-minute closer “Eternal Return” fully indulges this radiance, with soporific vibraphone loosely marking the meters through distended lines of guitar and violin. Think Earth 2.0, allowing Dylan Carlson’s guitar leads to bleed outside the pocket. At the midpoint, an organ introduces a repetitive piano-and-synthesizer figure. It’s practically danceable. Kristoffer Rygg falls into this rhythm, delivering a poem of mixed mythologies (Hades collides with the Wilderness of Sin, and so on) in his melodramatic croon. It’s offered as a culmination.</p>
<p>Sunn O))) and Ulver have collaborated before for “CUTWOODeD”, an obscure, abstruse track appended to a version of <i>White1</i> issued through <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Sunn-O-White/release/738321"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a very limited box set</a> several years after the original’s release. That sidelong span was darker and more menacing than anything on <i>Terrestrials</i>, with death-of-machines wheezes and layered, low-lying drones tracing a bleak landscape. But in retrospect, that decade-old collaboration shares the same aversion to momentum—rising, falling, climaxing, moving toward much of anything—that handicaps <i>Terrestrials</i>. On “CUTWOODed”, only a distant electronic thud urged the listener onward, a beacon providing a semblance of forward motion.</p>
<p>These three tracks are much more sculpted and finessed than that very deep cut, but the same feeling of lingering and waiting presides. These are introductions to something that never really arrives. When Rygg’s stentorian voices vanishes during “Eternal Return”, the music limps into the void for another four minutes, an anti-climax that gives even the biggest moment here the elliptical feeling of a preamble. Despite some rather majestic sheets of sound and many moments of instrumental interplay that suggest giants from Ennio Morricone to Philip Glass and from Jon Hassell to the Necks, <i>Terrestrials </i>is a slight musical drift, a soundtrack unattached to a significant story.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <i>Terrestrials </i>works as a likable listen, a liminal play concerning the push and pull between dusk and dawn. But it serves as a mere footnote or, at beast, an appealing redundancy for Sunn O))) and Ulver, two acts whose power has long stemmed from their willingness and ability to push past the parameters of genre. Together, they redouble one another’s outsider inclinations, but they push until they become all but unmoored to the thrall endemic to their best work. After the sun rises on these meditations, then, you can simply go about your daily routine, somewhat elevated but mostly unaltered.</p></div>"|18861.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18861-sunn-o-ulver-terrestrials/|6.9|Grayson Haver Currin

It ended with a silent moment and Mark mumbled, ‘fire talk’ signifying the weight of the convo.” The anecdote is exemplary of recent Colorado headlines and of Woodsman itself. Though the group relocated from Denver to Brooklyn in 2011, its third LP has the feeling of something recorded mountainside. It echoes with steady rhythms yet can fall prey to a meandering scope. It’s wild and, yes, psychedelic<i>.</i></p>
<p class=""p1"">In 2011, Woodsman were—like many groups—swept up in a riptide of Animal Collective comparisons. And for good reason: On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15070-rare-forms/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rare Forms</i></a>, Demolar’s vocals combined with Woodsman’s brand of electro-psych fit that bill. A song like “I Can’t Move” might even be able to fool a focus group plucked off of Bedford Avenue. But, on <i>Woodsman</i>, the vocals are absent. It allows for a more potent—if not entirely diverse or plotted-out—effort. The fat has been trimmed, which let the instrumentals shine through. Still, their patterns are wild. </p>
<p class=""p4"">Not to delve too deeply into sticky territory, but Woodsman have settled into its moniker most appropriately this time around. <i>Woodsman</i> can be raw and feral, more akin to the sounds cultivated by labelmates Tjutjuna—if not quite as hard and driving. The dissonant-soaked “Pre” borrows an exclamatory page from the ferocity of Lightning Bolt or, even, Buddy Rich before “Gravelines” settles on the crux of a gameplan: rolling, primitive rhythms bathed in circuitous guitar parts. It’s a state of nature—perhaps a sonic counterpart to a campfire night like Peterson describes—with sounds of distant chants. It’s Thomas Hobbes on a vision quest.</p>
<p class=""p4"">The chugging “Healthy Life” takes one of those far-flung incantations from a very New York place. The album was recorded with Daniel James Schlett at his Strange Weather studio. (Drummer Dylan Shumaker rounds out the trio; another drummer, Eston Lathrop left the group around the time of the move but can still be heard on album closer, “Teleseparation.”) At the time, Strange Weather was located on Broadway under the J train, and the band entered the Hewes Street station with a portable recorder. What they found was a talkative MTA booth employee ready to reflect on life. It’s a cute tidbit and one that makes relatively insipid samples much more interesting. Most of all, it places Woodsman in its new urban context. </p>
<p class=""p4"">As advertised, “Teleseparation,” features two drummers but it’s not the only one to feature rhythmic layering and, also, just plain-old swift movements from Shumaker. His drumming isn’t overly complex but the way he features bassy beats on his kit—as on the hooky “In the End, Remember When?”—is invigorating. His Remo bill has got to be steep.</p>
<p class=""p4"">Still, other tracks don’t benefit from such distinguishing characteristics and can run together into a monotonous blur. “Loose Leaf”—a dispensary name waiting to be trademarked (if it hasn’t been already)—is the only tune that clocks in over the six-minute mark: Phish New Year’s Eve jams these are not. But, despite some decent editing, there’s often a directionless effect. Certainly some sense of meandering or searching is intended, but the album falters when it loses any semblance of catchiness. “Obsidian,” for example, crawls along for three minutes but doesn’t end up anywhere distinctive—laser sounds spiraling into the ether like a <i>Star Wars</i> ship that’s having trouble starting. It’s a bit paradoxical to demand direction from a band which features so many psychedelic characteristics. Isn’t having definitive direction anti-psychedelic? Possibly. But some additional order, here, shouldn’t have gone up in smoke.</p></div>"|18934.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18934-woodsmen-woodsman/|6.7|Colin St. John

Broken Bells' roots can be traced to when Mercer lent his voice to the squiggly oddity ""Insane Lullaby"", a track that landed on the Burton/Mark Linkous project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13193-dark-night-of-the-soul/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dark Night of the Soul</i></a>. You can also draw a line from Mercer's previous album with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3768-the-shins/"" target=""_blank"">the Shins</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9808-wincing-the-night-away/"" target=""_blank""><i>Wincing the Night Away</i></a>, which moved away from the spiky guitar pop of their first two star-making records towards moodier, more impressionistic territory. A subtly excellent album that has benefited from the passage of time, <i>Wincing the Night Away</i> nonetheless sounded like a statement of defeat from a songwriter who had experienced major success earlier in that decade.</p>
<p>Broken Bells' self-titled album arrived as the prospects of a new Shins album dimmed, so the new group's existence alone prompted a sigh of relief. You heard the 2010 debut and the accompanying <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15262-meyrin-fields-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Meyrin Fields</i> EP</a> and thought, well, if this is what Mercer plans to do with his time, it could be worse. Two years later, he shattered this notion with the Shins' fourth record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16390-port-of-morrow/"" target=""_blank""><i>Port of Morrow</i></a>, an energetic, colorfully overstuffed collection that showcased his maturity as a real-deal vocalist. The Shins' successful return upped the ante for whatever Mercer tried next and, two years later, we have Broken Bells' second album, <i>After the Disco</i>.</p>
<p>The first Broken Bells album was an eclectic, low-stakes affair that, at its best, came across as two seasoned musicians taking advantage of a major-label budget (the list of additional contributors dwarfed <i>Port of Morrow</i>'s considerable collab-a-palooza). The record dipped in and out of different sounds and styles—wheezing indie-pop, drum-machine percolators, Beach Boys-style funhouse psychedelia. The songs lacked the staying power of the Shins' best work but there was enough sonic variety to make for an intermittently engaging listen.</p>
<p><i>After the Disco</i> is a more cohesive record, and that turns out to be the problem: Mercer and Burton's eccentricities have been sanded down to a single, flattened plane. Broken Bells have been fond of outer space imagery—Christina Hendricks' turn as a vacationing astronaut for the video for Broken Bells' ""The Ghost Inside"", the similarly astral series of short films accompanying <i>After the Disco</i>'s singles—and this set represents the sonic manifestation of their space-is-the-place mindset, with music that is weightless, atmospherically heavy, and inert. The LP's title suggests that Broken Bells' attentions have turned to the dancefloor, and to a point that holds true—there's the perky beat and synth stabs of the title track, Mercer's strange Bee Gees affectation on ""Holding on for Life"", the elided grandeur of ""The Changing Lights"". But too often, these songs sound lifeless and drained of energy. </p>
<p>Still, Mercer remains one of North America's stronger melodic songwriters. His sing-songy cadence on the verse section of ""After the Disco"" proves an instant earworm, and the acoustic dusk of ""Lazy Wonderland"" stands with the best in Mercer's catalogue, reminiscent of <i>Port of Morrow</i>'s lovely, languid ""September"". But these glimmers of warmth quickly fade in <i>After the Disco</i>'s chilly environs; as soon as ""After the Disco"" hits its bridge, the melody falters and Mercer is forced to hop around in his vocal range, coming across as bad karaoke. Meanwhile, it's possible to pinpoint to the second where ""Lazy Wonderland"" heads into leaden territory (1:28) with dramatic strings and a suffocating sense of self-importance.</p>
<p>Strings and self-importance are par for the course for Burton, and you have to wonder if he's the album's weak link. A capable producer who made his name a decade ago by hitting the zeitgeist jackpot with his Jay-Z/Beatles mash-up LP <i>The Grey Album</i>, Burton has had success as a consummate collaborator—2003's inventive <i>Ghetto Pop Life</i> with rapper Jemini, the retro-tripping soul of his and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/910-cee-lo-green/"" target=""_blank"">Cee-Lo</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1866-gnarls-barkley/"" target=""_blank"">Gnarls Barkley</a> project, his stoned, giggly collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27670-doom/"" target=""_blank"">DOOM</a>, the diffuse melancholia of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"" target=""_blank"">Beck</a>'s underappreciated 2008 album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11977-modern-guilt/"" target=""_blank"">Modern Guilt</a>. </i>But in 2014, it's hard to identify what makes him distinctive apart from his client list. His penchant for foggy psychedelia peaked on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys/"" target=""_blank"">the Black Keys</a>' solid 2008 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11358-attack-release/"" target=""_blank""><i>Attack &amp; Release</i></a>, and since then the projects he's been involved with have been comparatively stiff, like his melodramatic LP with Italian composer Daniele Luppi, 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15435-rome/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rome</i></a>. When the strings come in on <i>After the Disco</i>'s ""The Remains of Rock &amp; Roll"" (sometimes the jokes write themselves), it inspires fantasies of Danger Mouse projects that feature, well, less Danger Mouse.</p>
<p>For his part, James Mercer has proven amenable to collaboration. On <i>Port of Morrow, </i>the Shins' new line-up functioned essentially as anonymous sideman as Mercer employed a DJ Khaled-sized cast of collaborators. That record's try-anything approach confirmed that, whether it be Steve Miller Band rip-offs or spiky new-wave callbacks, his aesthetic can fit into any style. This sense of game-for-whatever adventurousness has to be why he continues to work with Burton as Broken Bells, but given the Shins' continued success and growing range, and what Mercer and Burton managed here, it's hard to think of why this project needs to exist. </p></div>"|18914.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18914-broken-bells-after-the-disco/|5.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

It secured them a sizable fanbase and not much respect as a rock band: it’s hard to get taken seriously when your first big break involves winning a <a href=""http://www.virgin.com/news/bombay-bicycle-club-watch-road-v-winners-new-video"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Battle of the Bands</a>, and even as their music improved significantly, this was often credited to their producers. </span><span>But that all happened in the span of two years, about six months less than it took just to make their fourth LP. Another radical change and a wonder of cosmetic surgery, <i>So Long, See You Tomorrow </i>is an often dazzling, euphoric electronic-pop record where Bombay Bicycle Club have decided they don’t want to be seen as a rock band anyway.</span></p>
<p>Who knew that Bombay Bicycle Club's ultimate destiny would involve  finally figuring out a way where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30305-tnght/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">TNGHT</a> and the greatest hits of <a href=""http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alex-patsavas-industrys-premier-music-418858"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Alexandra Patsavas</a> can coexist? On a musical level, it’s pretty much what most upstart “indie rock” (read: synth-pop) acts are trying in vain to suss out—how to make syncable, meet-cute songs conversant in maximalist, omnivorous R&amp;B and hip-hop production. Compared to damn near every band trying to do the same thing, Bombay Bicycle Club are exceedingly well-prepared, having started as a hooky, if indistinct pop band and learning about crowd-pleasing electronic production by playing actual festivals. They’re operating with a broad scope and an eagerness to please, so every time they go overboard with the ProTools, it’s in the service of adding fundamental pleasures of melody or rhythm rather than dull atmosphere. The band recorded and produced <i>So Long</i> in their own studio, and wisely enlisted Mark Rankin as an engineer and mixer—he worked on the most recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18087-queens-of-the-stone-age-like-clockwork"">Queens of the Stone Age</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18298-alunageorge-body-music"">AlunaGeorge</a> albums and that’s adequate preparation for band who likely asked him, “help us sound like both.”  </p>
<p>In particular, first single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16365-carry-me"">“Carry Me”</a> and opener “Overdone” show Bombay Bicycle Club getting newly aggressive, where they just want to express their joy in discovering different forms of sonic expression. The pummeling drum track of “Overdone” would’ve been ear-turning enough, but the title becomes a wink as the band piles on battling countermelodies, percussive synths, staggered drops and octave-shifted guitars. Meanwhile, “Carry Me” boasts the closest thing to a guitar riff, but it sounds more like a trombone over an impossibly jerky, inhuman rhythm, imagining <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13951-hidden/"">Hidden</a></i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5694-these-new-puritans/"">These New Puritans</a> as flower children rather than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11671-we-want-war/"">warmongers</a>.</p>
<p>As fun as it is to hear Bombay Bicycle Club get all RoboCop, surrounding Steadman’s all-too-human vocals with rock ‘em, sock ‘em machinery, they’re even better at demonstrating how these bold new sounds can augment their charming, heart-on-sleeve wimpiness. The crucial thing here is that Steadman wants to show you what he’s learned from pop radio, not merely how much he likes Aaliyah. The marching band percussion lent to “It’s Alright Now” shows a band that’s smart about their pilfering from pop and R&amp;B—they probably love Destiny’s Child’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqeIiF0DlTg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Lose My Breath”</a> and decided to take the parts that could best compliment their burst-and-bloom, gushing hooks, while “Home By Now” teases with a bit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream"">radio killa</a> production before shifting towards a gorgeous, crushed-out heavenly duet between Steadman and Lucy Rose.</p>
<p>All of this happens within the first six songs and perhaps if Bombay Bicycle Club was more judicious about its pacing, <i>So Long</i> might be a total triumph instead of a very good LP adhering to a pop albums' tendency to frontload. Almost everything at least has its charms, though the cacophony of layered drums that eventually brings “Eyes Off You” and the title track to a climax feel like knowing apologies for the pretty, if a bit limpid piano balladry that precedes it. <i>So Long</i>’s dizzying array of percussion and instrumentation was meant to be a sonic passport of sorts, as Steadman spent the past couple of years globetrotting around Asia and Africa, but “Feel” is the one time where things get a little too <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>.</p>
<p>Even still, it's hard to use Bombay Bicycle Club's enthusiasm against them. Whatever the songs on <i>So Long</i> are actually about is up for debate despite their plainspokenness, but suffice to say, they trigger the exact joy buzzers that leave you usually infatuated, perhaps a bit hopefully lovelorn. As with everything on <i>So Long</i>, it’s really the thought that counts and the hook on “Feel” lets you know what they’re trying to get at—“just one feeling,” repeated over and over.</p></div>"|18862.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18862-bombay-bicycle-club-so-long-see-you-tomorrow/|7.7|Ian Cohen

A fan of the 1977 punk explosion, the aspiring singer-guitarist was inspired by the spirit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4113-the-slits/"" target=""_blank"">the Slits</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"" target=""_blank"">the Fall</a> even as he began picking up on the clean-toned intricacy of jazz guitarists Wes Montgomery and Django Reinhardt. He also loved soul. In fact, as he confesses in the BBC interview, the silky chord progression of “Walk Out to Winter” was swiped from the Motown classic “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough"". Seeing as how Frame was 15 when he began writing <i>High Land</i> and 18 when he recorded it, “precocious” is a word that gets thrown around a lot. But the title of album’s opening track, “Oblivious,” could be read as equally telling. Flush with youth, Frame seemed blissfully unaware that these pieces weren’t supposed to fit together. Either that or he didn’t know it was supposed to make a difference.</p>
<p>Frame wasn’t entirely alone. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3226-orange-juice/"" target=""_blank"">Orange Juice</a>—Aztec Camera’s close comrades on the Glasgow indie label Postcard Records—had already combined some of these same elements before Frame made his Postcard debut, the 1981 single “Just Like Gold.” And the <i>NME</i>’s famous <i>C81</i> cassette compilation included, alongside Aztec Camera and Orange Juice, Scritti Politti’s “The ‘Sweetest Girl’”, Green Gartside’s first foray into post-punk soulfulness. Rather than an outgrowth of grayish post-punk, though, Aztec Camera was a negative afterimage rendered in pastels. By the time “Pillar to Post,” the group’s first single for Rough Trade, came out in 1982, Frame and crew had become labelmates with another young quartet that featured jangling guitars, crooned vocals, and a snappy rhythm section: the Smiths.</p>
<p>“Pillar to Post”, “Oblivious”, and “Walk Out to Winter” comprise the trio singles released off of 1983’s <i>High Land</i>, newly reissued in an expanded, 30th-anniversary edition. Even if they were the only good songs, the album would still be a milestone. But every track is stellar. Buoyant and joyous, yet italicized with clever melancholy, “Oblivious” is the most punchy of the three. Frame’s jazzy guitar runs and jubilant arpeggios add a jittery energy to his teenage angst. Unlike Morrissey, he doesn’t have a mean moan in his body. He doesn’t have Morrissey’s depth, either, but that’s easily overlooked when “Pillar to Post” saunters up with funk-pop hook and plants the thoroughly Smithsian sentiment “Once I was happy in happy extremes” on the lips like a stolen kiss. “Walk Out to Winter” is the most sophisticated of <i>High Land</i>’s singles. A whirling, bitterly cheery paean to the death of punk, as Frame explains in his recent BBC interview), it wonders where all the young miserablists of his generation will go now. Singing like a pimply, gum-chewing Glenn Tilbrook, Frame answers his own question.</p>
<p>Singles aside, standouts abound. From the pastoral-folk guitars and jogging bass line to the saucy handclaps and modified <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2052-richard-hell/"" target=""_blank"">Richard Hell</a> line (“Love comes in slurs”), “The Boy Wonders” is more barely coded speculation about what happens when adulthood leaves a child-shaped void in one’s soul. Same goes for the pensive “The Bugle Sounds Again” and even the album’s naked, acoustic closer, “Down the Dip,” a pub-busker anthem that slides a hint of Frame’s leftist, Red Wedge politics—never very pronounced in his songs—in among an atmosphere of spilled pints. The reissue of <i>High Land</i> comes with copious bonus tracks, including the original single version of “Pillar to Post”, which sounds raw and robust compared to the album version’s clean, sharp shimmer. Of the three single B-sides included, “Queen’s Tattoo” is the most intriguing, a twangy, galloping romp that predates Morrissey’s first flirtation with rockabilly, the Smiths’ “Rusholme Ruffians”, by three years. On the other end of the spectrum are the 12” dance mixes of “Walk Out to Winter” and “Oblivious”. As curiosities go, they demonstrate just how pliable Aztec Camera’s riffs and rhythms were; as new-wave floor-fillers, they don’t hold a candle to any given album track by, say, Spandau Ballet. The handful of live radio sessions, on the other hand, capture a barely-legal Frame at his immaculate, brassy best.</p>
<p>Following the success of <i>High Land</i>, Frame had to grow up quickly. He did so, but always in a good way. For the rest of the 80s, Aztec Camera became a more calculated concern, with a rotating cast of session musicians that would include everyone from members of Dire Straits to—perhaps inevitably—a future (if fleeting) guitarist of the Smiths, Craig Gannon. By 1986, the Postcard-inspired C86 movement was splitting the difference between Aztec Camera and the buzzsaw punks that preceded them. Frame responded by removing his own guitar almost entirely from the equation with Aztec Camera’s biggest hit, 1988’s “Somewhere in My Heart.” Despite a back-to-basics rally in the 90s, Aztec Camera folded in 1995; Frame, now fifty, still enjoys a respectable solo career. <i>High Land</i> is not only his first statement of intent as a songwriter, it’s his most innovative, his most influential, and his most timelessly vivid. Peaking early can be bittersweet, but the album is all the better for it.</p></div>"|18867.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18867-aztec-camera-high-land-hard-rain/|8.3|Jason Heller

As a kid, your natural love of the goofy is indulged and even encouraged. But once you “mature,"" you’re supposed to take art seriously only if it’s serious, or if it’s humorous in a clever or sophisticated way. Otherwise, it should be dismissed as novelty. Even an ostensibly silly artist like </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10976-weird-al-yankovic/"">“Weird Al” Yankovic</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> needs the weight of parody to earn respect; it’s hard to imagine him winning Grammies if his music were just about food.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">The problem with this paradigm is it oversimplifies art, and ignores how silliness can be serious and intelligent work can be goofy. Max Eisenberg understands this. “I’ve never been afraid to play the part of the fool,” he said in a 2012 </span><a href=""http://janepain.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/interview-with-dj-dog-dick/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">. “You need to show the awkward, stupid parts of existence as much as you need to show the brilliant, austere parts.” Perhaps that philosophy is what led him to a moniker as silly as DJ Dog Dick, and surely it’s what’s made him both serious craftsman and fearless goofball.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><i>The Life Stains</i>, </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">the first DJ Dog Dick album, is a full-on expression of Eisenberg’s artistic attitude. It opens with its two silliest tracks: “</span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BGPgGrMCBY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Our Kin</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">”, a </span><a href=""http://www.drdemento.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Demento</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">-ready song featuring farting tuba and “cartoon voices,” and “Hello Cruel World”, an over-the-top skit recreating a delirious baby delivery. But as the album progresses, sneaky craft bleeds in, and humor and gravity meld into something not so easily pegged. Part of that is due to Eisenberg’s stylistic diversity. He began DJ Dog Dick as an avant-rap project, and you can hear hip-hop in almost every track. But there’s also clear influences from R&amp;B, art-pop, tearful balladry, new wave, electronica, and noise.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The latter is an integral part of Eisenberg’s musical DNA. His first solo tour was with notorious French performance arist </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Louis_Costes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Jean-Louis Costes</span></a><span>, and in the mid-00s he was a member of the singular Baltimore noise outfit </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6392-nautical-almanac/""><span>Nautical Almanac</span></a><span>. Those experiences gave him not only an appreciation of sonic absurdity - the idea that anything can be music - but an ear for textures and layers. This gives a density to tunes like the clanging “Pedigris” and the robo-rapped “Monkey.” It also elevates the minimalism of “Fourth of July”, technoid throb of “Sharing Scars,” and freak-psych of “Why’s a Dog?” into the territory of surreal masters such as </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars/""><span>Liars</span></a><span> and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/521-butthole-surfers/""><span>Butthole Surfers</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>What’s most surprising about </span><i>The Life Stains </i><span>is how Eisenberg morphs his avant-leaning skills into a weirdo-pop sensilbilty. Quite a few tunes here bear the uncommon combo of well-honed hook and curveball angles that marks the farther-out work of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8595-todd-rundgren/""><span>Todd Rundgren</span></a><span>, or the farther-in side of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2930-r-stevie-moore/""><span>R. Stevie Moore</span></a><span>.  That’s clearest on the album’s shiniest gem, the virally catchy “</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16214-grease-that-i-got/""><span>Grease That I Got</span></a><span>”. Over pushing bass and escalating treble, Eisenberg paints love as a viscous liquid ready to boil. “The grease that I got likes to hiss and pop a lot,” he warbles. “What I chopped is in the stock pot, burner don’t stop.”</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-780c9014-e67f-11d9-16bb-e830e9efebdb""><span>That’s some clever verbiage, but it’s delivered without a smirk. In fact, irony is refreshingly absent on </span><span><i>The Life Stains</i>. </span><span>Eisenberg always comes off earnest even when he clearly wants you to laugh. At the same time, his wackiness constantly threatens to go insane.

Big A, little a) differentiated themselves by loading up on so much percussive firepower, the band could host their own <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vjk01Wo-aEs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Boadrum</a> reenactment. All that extra thump was in service of John Atkinson’s stated goal of fronting “<a href=""http://www.bowlegsmusic.com/features/interviews/an-interview-with-big-a-little-a-34208"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the ultimate loft party band</a>,” however, Aa’s fractious treatment of groove is not exactly the stuff of which all-night dance-athons are made. If anything, their 2007 debut, <i>gAame</i>, was more like the sound of a loft party getting busted—doors knocked down with battering rams, bells ringing, tripped-up beats, and panicked confusion. And coming from a band whose M.O. seems fairly simple and primal on the surface—bash the shit out of drum, scream a lot—<i>gAame</i> was a strategically structured affair, one that was as interested in ominous builds and intensifying atmospheres as chaotic, ecstatic release.</p>
<p>So given their meticulous ethic, it’s not a complete surprise that it’s taken Aa seven years to release a proper follow-up (though day jobs and domesticity inevitably got in the way, too). But where the band once rolled out the extra drum kits to set themselves apart from the post-millennial post-punk pack, this time out, Aa are able to stand out just by showing up—in the intervening years, their many peers have variously <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9254-rides-the-subway-ep/"" target=""_blank"">broken up</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16663-diver/"" target=""_blank"">gone soft</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16681-wixiw/"" target=""_blank"">turned more electronic</a>, or more <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqwXak1BxKo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">eccentric</a>, or become <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9WVVWSdlSk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a top-draw festival acts</a>, all while the lingering, sedating fog of chillwave still permeates wide swaths of the underground. Though not the magnum opus its protracted gestation period might suggest (it clocks in at just over a half hour), <i>VoyAager</i> bears evidence of a painstaking refinement. The album’s roots date back to 2009’s interim <i>Glossy</i> EP, whose two lengthy tracks have been pared down for inclusion here, a distillation that exemplifies <i>VoyAager’s</i> more considered approach: the crater-stomping clatter is harnessed into more controlled outbursts, the jagged edges buffed by more omnipresent synths, the post-hardcore vocalizations tempered into more upbeat exhortations.</p>
<p>On a purely sonic level, <i>VoyAager</i> is spectacular, its expertly sculpted 3-D sound world situated somewhere between the grandiose digi-symphonies of Fuck Buttons (ascendant opener “Promsac” could’ve been spooled off the second side of <i>Slow Focus</i>) and the industrialized, technicolor throttle of early Nine Inch Nails (see: the predatory Reznorian prowl of “Mossy,” a truncated <i>Glossy</i> reprise). But as with <i>gAame</i>, there’s still some uncertainty about how exactly vocals fit into the mix, and whether they can drive a song or just serve as another dissonant detail amid the melee. While the band evinces a newfound fondness for unison, wordless harmonies, the individual melody lines are deliberately obscured by droning AutoTune effects or synth-smeared deliveries (or, in the case of ""Gowntowner,"" at least one unflattering Flavor Flav-esque ""boyyeeeee!"")<i></i></p>
<p><i>VoyAager</i>’s crisper presentation suggests Aa are drawn to the luminous surfaces of pop music, but non-commital when it comes to writing proper pop songs; many of the tracks here feel like preludes or connective interludes setting us up for big moments that don’t always materialize. While the tremorous finale of “Fish Phone” offers an impressive showcase of Aa’s thundering force, the greatest sustained thrill is provided by “Glow Wreath”, which first appeared on <i>Gl</i><i>ossy</i> in extended nine-minute form, but is put to far more effective use here as a concentrated five-minute eruption that feels like the peak moment everything is working toward or reeling from. Its tropical, tribal thrust may not help Aa shake the Animal Collective comparisons they attracted early on, but this joyous jam could easily hold its own among the superior tracks on the similarly manic <i>Centipede Hz</i>. And for once, Aa’s shouting-in-tongues hysterics require no decoding: “Celebrate! Celebrate! Celebrate!,” Atkinson exclaims in the throes of the highest of highs, and he can be forgiven if it takes him till 2021 to come down.</p></div>"|18977.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18977-aa-voyaager/|6.7|Stuart Berman

And that’s not including the ones where someone’s on the verge of death or seriously headed towards it. Toddlers die, teenagers die, adults die, and the elderly die. They die of natural causes and in freak accidents. People die alone and people die by the dozens—handicapped children, single parents, grandmothers, serial killers. They die out of mercy and die long before they’re due. Rednecks die as respected men and white collar kids die in disgrace. But more importantly, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2331-mark-kozelek/"">Mark Kozelek</a> wants us to know that they all lived, loved, fought, fucked up, and often did the best they could, before he sets out to “find some poetry to make some sense of this and give some deeper meaning” to their tragedies. Turns out he doesn’t have to dig very far. Here, Kozelek does away with the metaphor and verbal obfuscation often used to <i>distract</i> an audience from their own joy, sadness, crippling failures, and small triumphs. If listeners find themselves unable to make it through <i>Benji</i> in one piece, it’s because Kozelek all but forces us to recognize how the most emotionally moving art can be mapped directly on to our own lives.</p>
<p>This is a culmination of the jarring shift in Kozelek's work that started with 2012’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16674-among-the-leaves/"">Among the Leaves</a></i>, an erratic, occasionally embarrassing, and fascinating tell-all about a life in music. Whereas early songwriting in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3539-red-house-painters"">Red House Painters</a> and Sun Kil Moon resulted in elegant, poetic lyrics that demanded a <a href=""http://www.caldoverderecords.com/books.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hardbound, 256-page compilation</a>, all of a sudden he was giving us songs about justifying a case of VD to his girlfriend, picking up water from 7-Eleven, and battling his own boredom with songwriting, all wrapped in songs with titles like “The Moderately Talented Yet Attractive Young Woman vs. the Exceptionally Talented Yet Not So Attractive Middle Aged Man"". It wasn’t a midlife crisis, exactly; it was more like watching your parents negotiate Facebook for the first time, equally excited and overwhelmed that they can share their daily minutiae but unaware of what to keep to themselves.</p>
<p><i>Benji</i> steps away from the focus on process in favor of songs that elevate exceedingly personal stories into universal displays of humanity. Presenting himself as no wiser, empathetic, or understanding than any of its subjects or his audience, Kozelek has crafted an album that anyone can feel but also one that, paradoxically, is filled with songs that wouldn't make sense if covered by anybody else. The opening “Carissa” is a portal towards the world Kozelek inhabits throughout <i>Benji</i>, all of it painfully real and subject to nature’s laws even as time seems frozen within it. The first line of <i>Benji</i> lays out the record's confrontational realism: “Carissa, when I first saw you, you were a lovely child/ And the last time I saw you, you were 15 and pregnant and running wild.” We learn a few things about her: she’s Mark Kozelek’s second cousin, and in the 20 years since Kozelek’s seen her, she’s had two kids, settled into a nursing job in a nondescript Ohio town and, in general, gotten her shit together—a rarity in a Mark Kozelek song. And we also know that she dies in a fire after an aerosol can explodes in the trash.</p>
<p>That alone doesn’t make “Carissa” stand out, not in the catalog of one of our most prolific miserablists. But unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14859-caroline/"">Caroline</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13656-elaine/"">Elaine </a>or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFQ4nuUuwNo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Katy</a>, Carissa has an effect on Kozelek that feels biological, that she’s a part of Kozelek’s flesh and blood and not just a muse, and he renders her story with detail that would be stunning for a novelist, let alone a songwriter. The chorus is sweetly sung and absolutely crushing: “Carissa was 35/ You don’t just raise two kids and take out your trash and die.” He’s right, that <i>shouldn’t</i> happen. Except the <i>same exact thing</i> happened to his uncle, which is detailed two songs later on “Truck Driver”.</p>
<p>Which leads to an important critical consideration: Do these songs resonate because we understand them to be true stories? We have little reason to doubt Kozelek’s authenticity, as <i>Benji</i> is full of proper nouns and historical facts that check out: Google some of the specificities mentioned during his eviscerating sexual inventory of “Dogs” and you find that there is indeed a Tangier and Red Lobster near the Erie Canal in Akron. When he calls his mom in ""Micheline"" and learns of his friend Brett’s death in 1999, he mentions booking a movie role—<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9Vv1Yrma54"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as the bassist from Stillwater in <i>Almost Famous</i></a>. At one point, he sings that “the Sopranos guy died at 51/ That’s the same age as the guy who’s coming to play drums,” and wouldn’t you know, former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> stickman Steve Shelley, who played on the record, turns 52 in June. Kozelek’s reaction to both aerosol can-related deaths in his family are basically, “you can’t make this shit up.” But what if he <i>did</i> make this shit up? If so, <i>Benji</i> arguably becomes an even more impressive record—the debilitating emotional response created by “Carissa” and “Truck Driver” are undeniably real, and if the stories are fiction, the guy did his homework.</p>
<p>Regardless of the real names and real events used throughout, nothing feels exploitative, unnecessary, or cruel the way some of the songs on <i>Among the Leaves</i> could. Nor is <i>Benji</i> subject to the navel-gazing self-importance that usually accompanies an aging musician making their “mortality” album. Despite most of it taking place in rural Ohio, people like Carissa and his uncle (“redneck that he was”) are never used as a stand-in for some salt-of-the-earth Middle American archetype or a cheap way to make some dippy point about us all being interconnected and <i>carpe diem</i>.  </p>
<p>Instead, <i>Benji</i> trusts in the complexity and power ingrained in anyone’s life story rather than using them for some grand statement that glorifies Kozelek’s own perspective. Most importantly, his storytelling has sharpened considerably. Befitting someone who watches an absurd amount of boxing, Kozelek’s prose has taken on pugilistic bent, where he can go five minutes or more dancing around, softening the listener with sharp jabs before landing a catastrophic body blow. This is best exhibited on the song “Micheline”, which has three acts linked by nothing but their end result, and the one where his grandmother dies is the <i>least</i> tragic.</p>
<p>This is obviously brutal stuff, its pacing, themes, and structure having more in common with cinema or literature than pop music. But <i>Benji</i> is still a piece of entertainment and it's a pleasure to listen to on that level. For one thing, it's the most musically diverse and sonically direct album he’s made since disbanding Red House Painters. He’ll never return to the turbulent sound of the 1990s, though you get raw, gutbucket blues (“Dogs”, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16104-richard-ramirez-died-today-of-natural-causes"">“Richard Ramirez Died Today of Natural Causes”</a>), swanky, horn-laced yacht-pop (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16504-sun-kil-moon-bens-my-friend"">“Ben’s My Friend”</a>), and a tender duet with Will Oldham (“I Can’t Live Without My Mother’s Love”), to name a few. And with its chipper harmonies and a fake Nels Cline solo (not Kozelek’s first joke <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS0dH2YUhbs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">at his expense</a>), “I Love My Dad” feels like a ribbing at latter-day <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco"">Wilco</a>, a dad-rock song about his dad.</p>
<p>So <i>Benji</i> can be funny as hell, too: The effervescent narrative “Ben’s My Friend” snaps us back into the present day after the happy ending of “Micheline” and follows Kozelek as he suffers through writer’s block, a distracted lunch in a restaurant filled with “sports bar shit,” and a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service"">Postal Service</a> concert where all the drunk kids with their cells appear to be “20 years younger.” He claims he’s too tired for the “backstage hi/bye” with pal <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6101-ben-gibbard"">Ben Gibbard</a> and he heads back to his hot tub in Tahoe, before revealing the real cause for his meltdown: “I’m content, but there’s a tinge of competitiveness.” “I Love My Dad” finds Kozelek possibly outing himself as a recovering alcoholic (“I’ll have an O’Doul’s and my friend here will have a Guinness”) and a victim of child abuse, but it's otherwise quotably hilarious, detailing a relationship with his father where valuable life lessons are imparted through both <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UwozcBau6w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Iron Mike-style beatdowns</a> and Edgar Winter records.</p>
<p><i>Benji</i> sounds more like Kozelek relating events instead of crafting them, which makes the continuity and reflexivity of the record feel both uncanny and the work of protracted genius. “Richard Ramirez Died Today of Natural Causes” was released months before it ended up as a thematic skeleton key on <i>Benji</i>, and it mentions a flight to Cleveland where he’ll be mourning a relative, which eventually became the inspiration for “Carissa”. “Ben’s My Friend” mentions a visit to Santa Fe that earlier served as the turning point of “I Watched the Film ‘The Song Remains the Same’”. On “I Love My Dad”, his father forces him to watch wrestling matches with a handicapped friend as a means of teaching him patience and the ability to shoot the shit and show respect for those in need. These lessons serves as the entire basis for “Jim Wise”. During that visit, they bring Jim food from Panera Bread and later you find out that Kozelek’s father likes to flirt with the girls there. As standalone pieces, “I Can’t Live Without My Mother’s Love” and “I Love My Dad” are  touching, heartfelt odes to his elderly parents and it’s interesting to notice the vast disparity in the tone of each: the latter is an elbow-poking, uncouth tribute to his father raising him to be the man that he is, while the former is a desperate plea for the parent that keeps him alive. </p>
<p>None of these things reveal themselves on the first listen but even after dozens, you never feel like you've exhausted <i>Benji's</i> secrets. The songs are stories, yes, but the kind that are told rather than read, ones you never hear the same way twice. I’ve heard the record compared to <i>Winesburg, Ohio</i>, a life-changing meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, the open-heart emotional surgery of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30868-majical-cloudz"">Majical Cloudz</a>’ <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18042-majical-cloudz-impersonator"">Impersonator</a></i>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>’s character-driven opus <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17253-good-kid-maad-city"">good kid, m.A.A.d. City</a></i>, which is indicative of the artistic merits of <i>Benji</i>, but also its ability to reach beyond the hardcore fanbase that has Kozelek has made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17626-mark-kozelek-live-at-phoenix-public-house-melbournelike-rats/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">no secret of his feelings towards as of late</a>. Though <i>Benji</i> has few of the ""Behind the Music"" set pieces that marked <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17960-the-album-leaf-sun-kil-moon-perils-from-the-sea"">Perils from the Sea</a></i>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14430-admiral-fell-promises"">Admiral Fell Promises</a>, </i>and <i>Among the Leaves</i>, and it lacks his stage banter's airing of grievances, this record slowly reveals itself as both a universal meditation on death and, very subtly, a recount of the life events that determined Mark Kozelek’s own artistic journey.  </p>
<p>“Dogs” takes its title from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lgOo8yEIPs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a track on Pink Floyd’s <i>Animals</i></a>. Kozelek’s has consistently acknowledged how the classic rock of his youth has stuck with him, from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FheMX8zfMf0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AC/DC</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRNBDQhOk_c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yes</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjA3EbKsl4E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Judas Priest </a>to Led Zeppelin, who inspire <i>Benji</i>’s jaw-dropping centerpiece “I Watched the Film ‘The Song Remains the Same’”. Anyone who's seen Led Zeppelin's profoundly dumbfounding medley of concert footage and Hammer of the Gods propaganda knows that the personal circumstances surrounding your viewing of the film is far more important than any of Zep's myth-making. Kozelek admits, ""I don't know what happened or what anyone did,"" and notes how the more pastoral, meditative ""The Rain Song"", ""Bron Yr Aur"", and ""No Quarter"" spoke to him more than the thunder of John Bonham's drumming or Jimmy Page's mahogany double-necked Gibson SG, leading him to conclude, ""from my earliest memories, I was a very melancholy kid.""</p>
<p>Three decades later, Kozelek cannot shake melancholy, will probably ""carry it to hell"", and in the meantime, uses ""I Watched the Film""'s deeply moving fingerpicking patterns (similar to “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqptegyFWbE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bron Yr Aur</a>”) to understand sadness' pervasive grip on his life. The song ends with Kozelek promising a trip to Santa Fe to find the guy who gave him his first record deal—and yes, 4AD’s Ivo Watts-Russell <a href=""http://www.how-soon.com/index.php/blog/entry/ivo_new_mexico/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">really does live in Santa Fe</a>. “Between my travel and his divorce,"" both have experienced their share of melancholy in the past two decades and have nothing to gain from each other anymore except a genuine connection and a moment to reflect. </p>
<p><span>That kind of sentiment represents the most profound shift that has occurred since </span><i>Among the Leaves</i><span>, when his interviews found him grousing about how </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8845-mark-kozelek/"" target=""_blank"">his fans are “guys in tennis shoes” and reviews compare him to young, bearded troubadour-types like Jose Gonzalez and Bon Iver</a><span>.</span> He goes to Santa Fe for no other reason than to tell Watts, <i>thank you</i>. Fine then, someone <i>does </i>get used as a stand-in on <i>Benji, </i>because the record as a whole feels like him thanking not just his fans and supporters, but everyone who he’s come across in his life, by making good on his promise to give their lives poetry and deeper meaning. So while <i>Benji</i> is consumed with death, sadness, mourning, and tragedy, there's gratitude within all this melancholy and it’s actually Kozelek’s<i> least</i> depressing and most life-affirming record: when faced with an album that exposes so much of the beauty, truth, ugliness, humor, and grace inherent in simply existing in this world, the only response is to go out and live.</p></div>"|18860.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18860-sun-kil-moon-benji/|9.2|Ian Cohen

Raymonde’s last full work was his <i>Blame Someone Else</i> record back in 1997, a pleasant if not deathless effort featuring his own soft, sighed singing. But given his participation not only with the Cocteaus for most of their existence but also This Mortal Coil, it wouldn’t’ve been surprising if he had something more to offer down the road.</p>
<p>Yet Stephanie Dosen, Raymonde’s project partner and the sole vocalist throughout, is the real key to <i>moon</i>’s gentle appeal. With the kind of quietly active resume that reaches back across 20 years and a slew of guest performances and solo releases both, the Wisconsin native ends up being the general focus throughout <i>moon</i>, with Raymonde contributing piano parts that form the overall basis of the songs. There are some further guest appearances to note: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead </a>freaks doubtless are already tracking the presence of Ed O’Brien and Phil Selway; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4827-midlake/"" target=""_blank"">Midlake</a>, who Dosen has recorded with, and Lanterns on the Lake members also take a bow. Yet it’s pretty much the Dosen and Raymonde Show in terms of the overall feeling.</p>
<p>There is definitely an echo of Raymonde’s concluding days with the Cocteaus, for all the time that has passed since—it’s far too much to call <i>moon</i> an actual extension of that act’s lovely final bow <i>Milk &amp; Kisses</i>, but there’s a clear sense of lush gentility at work, with rock arrangements that aim at understatement and mood. Dosen’s singing on first blush extends the connection; anyone who ever loved Elizabeth Fraser’s ear for layered sweetness in those last years of the band, overdubbed into gentle cascades, won’t be surprised at all by the opening “I Heard the Owl Call My Name”, much less by a fair amount of what follows.</p>
<p>That said the music on that track has a sturdy chug that’s more psych rock mystery than anything else, and it’s the first sign that Snowbird is its own combination of talents, something that’s in a particular vein but not a direct cloning. For a start, Dosen herself never sings cryptic or apparently glossolalic lyrics; if her singing softly blends into the arrangements at points, it’s still always understandable enough. If anything, as the album progresses Dosen’s vocal approach, more calmly serene than suddenly melancholy or sharp, suggests another performer entirely, the redoubtable Linda Perhacs. The breathtaking blend of high harmonies that sets the tone from the start of her <i>Parallelograms</i> album with “Chimacum Rain” gets an echo at many points throughout <i>moon</i>, while other musical touches like the hint of slide guitar on “Charming Birds from Trees” further expands the range of <i>moon</i> beyond immediate goth or shoegaze associations.</p>
<p>Beyond that there’s also a definite nature and nighttime theme at work given all the song titles and overall sequencing, something which also carries a bit of a Perhacs feeling if not that kind of rural or upcountry atmosphere. “Where Foxes Hide”, “Come to the Woods”, “Bears on My Trail”, “We Carry White Mice”—all sketch out a clear bucolic feeling, if not an always peaceful one, with the album concluding on a song called “Heart of the Woods” that seems to pretty well wrap everything up.</p>
<p>There are twists that elevate songs to new places, sometimes through the simplest of approaches. When “All Wishes Are Ghosts” shifts to a strong, almost UK-glam-ballad, Dosen sings “Just stay here, my darlin'” in a soft repeat, with the song fading into a blend of keyboards and strings—it’s a great coda that lifts up the whole song. But the most surprising moment may well be the last, with “Heart of the Woods” going almost completely against the mood of the album with crisp opening beats setting the initial mood. It's mixed with an understated brass part that could be something from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2417-lambchop/"" target=""_blank"">Lambchop</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/650-calexico/"" target=""_blank"">Calexico</a>, and ends <i>moon</i> with something just a little different.</p>
<p>It should be noted that there’s a further companion disc to the album, <i>luna</i>, where all 11 tracks are remixed by RxGibbs, in some cases to even more striking effect (“Porcelain” on the album is enjoyable, another predominantly piano-led piece that ebbs and flows; after the rework, it’s a spooked out slow dubgaze blend that calls to mind an act like A.R. Kane, but with Dosen and Raymonde’s contributions still key). But <i>moon</i> is plenty fine in its own right, and if this heralds a return to further music from Raymonde as well as getting Dosen a little more attention than previously, then nothing wrong with that in the slightest.</p></div>"|18948.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18948-snowbird-snow/|6.9|Ned Raggett

Their stolid rock drums were newly tinged with a disco tick-tock; an electronic sequencer pulsed out fleet arpeggios beneath the live musicianship. These surprising changes are reflected on fourth LP <i>Past Life</i>, which should still have enough sentimental grist to satisfy old fans while broadening the band's appeal to people who prefer a little more dynamism in their dolor.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the change is a reduction in personnel from a sextet to a quartet, and the band also worked with an outside producer, Nicolas Vernhes (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5094-deerhunter/"" target=""_blank"">Deerhunter</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Projectors</a>), for the first time. In becoming leaner and less hermetic, Lost in the Trees seems to have freed itself from its habitual pomp. There are still the ringing guitars of indie rock, the vaporous harmonies of choral music, and the vigorous string and piano arrangements of classical. And as always, bandleader Ari Picker's lofty tenor is a pleasure to hear, especially as it rises over the prickling guitar of album highlight ""Daunting Friend"". But while it was always a stretch to call a six-piece ""orchestral,"" this chamber-music-sized lineup definitely sheds the excess the term might imply, and while Picker is a canny writer for strings and piano, he seems more focused on giving the songs stiff spines than frilly embroideries. The resulting music is refreshingly streamlined and direct.</p>
<p>The atmospheric ""Excos"" opens the album on a familiar note, with shimmering, panning cymbals and a slow curl of piano opening out from the slightly distorted choral lines of Emma Nadeau. But the band's new look quickly presents itself on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7dT_rFnd1o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the title track</a>, an anthem taut with lyrical electric guitar work and a juddering electronic undercarriage. The thick, pumping bass of songs such as ""Lady in White"" and ""Wake"" introduces a facet that has seldom been heard in Lost in the Trees' chaste music—sex—while standout deep cut ""Sun"" shows that they can also bring their new energy to the kind of feather-light songs on which they made their name. The lyrics still strike at grand notes: Angels zip around, light comes out of hearts, and birds, somehow, come out of eyes. But death, still lurking after the difficult memorial album <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2012/03/11/147982033/first-listen-lost-in-the-trees-a-church-that-fits-our-needs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>A Church That Fits Our Needs</i></a>, adds a newly earned gravity and wisdom to the proceedings without being the focus.</p>
<p>Picker remains good at creating a sense of towering scale and charged atmosphere, and the heavenly light that suffuses his music takes on a more humble and terrestrial hue, for the better. Picker sounds revivified, as if he's having more fun, and the feeling is mutual. After they've spent so long swirling high up in the rarified air, it's exciting to hear Lost in the Trees planting their music so firmly in the body, their feet on the ground, tapping.</p></div>"|18910.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18910-lost-in-the-trees-past-life/|7.0|Brian Howe

The mood is solemn, the tempos are slow, and each note carries within it the suggestion that it might be the band’s last.</p>
<p>In some cases, repetition is a sign of laziness or lack of imagination; in others—like Bohren’s or the Ramones’—it’s a show of commitment to an idea so elegant in its original design that changing it would constitute betrayal. “We always offer our music in the same way and with the same enthusiasm,” the band’s saxophonist and keyboard player, Christoph Clöser, recently told <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/10434-bohren-der-club-of-gore-interview-supersonic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an interviewer</a>—which is to say with no discernible enthusiasm at all. “If the audience is strong enough to suffer uneventful music, we and the listeners can celebrate as a kind of mass.” </p>
<p>One reason Bohren persists in being so interesting despite their uneventfulness is that their music contains a kind of secret history. Lounge jazz, dark ambience, the languorous adagios of classical-music requiem, and the saturated romance of Italian film soundtracks: All of it is folded into <i>Piano Nights</i>. Heard at a distance, the album can sound uniform and insubstantial; up close, it not only covers a lot of ground, but ground you might not expect to overlap.</p>
<p>For as gentle as their sound is, the band has always played with intensity and conviction. At their slowest tempos a Bohren song feels like a series of notes both disconnected from the ones before it and yet articulated with total clarity, like bright stars forming a constellation in an otherwise dark sky. When I saw the band live in 2008, the tension in the room wasn’t a function of volume or speed, but the contrast between the certainty of the notes they played and the silences that followed. Watching them—four hunched German men in charcoal and black—was like watching horror-movie zombies lumber toward their next kill: Each blow was just a matter of time. </p>
<p>If there’s been an evolution in the band’s approach, it’s mostly sonic. Their earliest recordings were chilly and even brittle; <i>Piano Nights</i> is luxurious in its warmth. Nearly every track is backlit by vaporous ambience; the cymbals seem to ring in slow motion.</p>
<p>The sharpest voice in the mix is usually the saxophone, which Clöser plays with the persistent, exhausted tone of someone trying to explain something they’ve tried to explain a thousand times before—too tired to fight but not tired enough to give up.</p>
<p>Yes, this music gets dull—it’s supposed to. I can’t imagine listening to it all the time for the same reasons I can’t imagine trying to cook an entire meal using only a garlic press. But in their limited pursuits Bohren captures a mood other music either struggles to or just doesn’t bother with: Not sadness (too acute), not angst, but a sumptuous, all-purpose melancholy, the kind of thing you might experience watching a frozen field from the window of a slow-moving train.</p>
<p>Clöser had used the word “mass.” The highlights on <i>Piano Nights</i>—“Fahr zur Hölle,” “Verloren (Alles),” “Segeln ohne Wind”—feel like church music. The sly, suggestive blue notes of jazz give way to processions of organ and horn. What was once threatening and concealed feels stewarded toward the light. “Triumph” is too corny a word for a band like Bohren &amp; der Club of Gore. But for the first time, it might fit. </p></div>"|18870.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18870-bohren-der-club-of-gore-piano-nights/|7.3|Mike Powell

In 2012, Daniel T. Rodgers </span><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Age-Fracture-Daniel-T-Rodgers/dp/0674064364"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>penned a book</span></a><span> in which he posited that Western society underwent an epochal crisis of confidence following World War II. “Strong metaphors of society were supplanted by weaker ones,” he wrote. “Imagined collectivities shrank; notions of structure and power thinned out. Viewed by its acts of mind, the last quarter of the century was an era of disaggregation, a great age of fracture.”</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This seems relevant when discussing the ambitions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31012-cymbals/"" target=""_blank"">CYMBALS</a>, a London band who’ve titled their latest and greatest album after Rodgers’ book. When the band first debuted they were on the scrappy side of post-punk, releasing their energy in brief, nervous bursts. On </span><i>The Age of Fracture</i><span>, they’ve settled down and drawn out a solemn groove, furthering a sound indebted to bands like New Order and Depeche Mode, acts who sensed that sometimes the best way to solve an existential crisis was to leave it all on the dancefloor. The album opens on a dreamlike note, synths slowly floating in as drum machines layer into a smoky, sublimated release; it sets the tone for “The Natural World"", where singer Jack Cleverly nearly goes hoarse yelping about the trials and tribulations of getting to know someone as the groove snaps like a rubber band. “I don’t know enough about you,” he sings, “to be kind to you."" It’s an admittal of narcissism given an honest feel through the song’s orgastic form, in which synths interlock and flow into a crystalline river. Because who could lie when they’re moving that freely?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The band is largely concerned with degrees of distance and the ways in which the age of fracture describes not just the geopolitical world, but the interpersonal one. If that sounds like a big pill, well: These songs are much longer than anything they’ve ever done, and it sometimes it feels like a minute or three could’ve been lopped off here and there. “Like An Animal” slows the groove to a crawl as Cleverly intones self-involved lyrics like “Nobody’s looking/ No one cares” in a way that’s reminiscent of Peter Gabriel at his most tortuously ponderous. They’re much better when keeping it simple, like when they ride the stripped down riff on “Erosion” toward crescendoing exultation. There’s propulsion, but a softer type. Take a song like “This City”, which hums along somnambulant rhythms as it considers how to make a weary life feel less trivial, or the interstitial self-titled track.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-3d8e0692-d9d6-654f-46d0-745d4d273b5e""><span>That’s the realm where CYMBALS work best, when they use understated sonic brushstrokes—a flutter of synths here and there—to deepen the mood. The penultimate song, “The End"", feels characteristic of its title, which refers to the conclusion of a long night spent with someone you barely know. Then, just as the lights turn on to send everybody home, there’s the hopeful denouement: “Call Me"", out of which a burbling bass line anticipates a necessary amount of sleep before the next night out. The range of states is what makes the record convincing: CYMBALS do enough to get you moving, and through that, thinking about where we are in relation to each other.</span></span></p></div>"|18869.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18869-cymbals-the-age-of-fracture/|7.1|Jeremy Gordon

Of all the ideas in Eric Berglund's work since his duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5358-the-tough-alliance/"" target=""_blank"">the Tough Alliance </a>emerged from Sweden several years ago, those two have been constants. On the title track from TTA's cult-beloved <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10668-a-new-chance/"" target=""_blank""><i>A New Chance</i></a>, he deployed a fitting line of movie dialogue: ""It's not a question of understanding. If you feel it, you feel it, stupid."" The label he runs, Sincerely Yours, is deeply anti-""social.""</p>
<p>And yet what web presence Berglund <i>does</i> have is meticulously curated, and straight-faced grandiosity is a hallmark of public statements from Gothenburg's ""ultra messiah aka mr yeah aka life aka you."" His debut album under solo alias ceo, 2010's <i>White Magic</i>, suggested he'd made peace with the contradictions between creativity and publicity, self-expression and selling yourself; its sumptuous, post-Internet miniatures often touched on themes of illumination and transcendence. Lead single ""Come With Me""—lush and brash enough for an alternate Top 40, as weird and hermetic as the cult indie-dance record it really was—beckoned listeners ""to a place I call reality.""</p>
<p>Three-and-a-half years later, that place has gotten a little more real. The sophomore album from CEO (yes, all caps now) comes after label signees <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12663-air-france/"" target=""_blank"">Air France</a> called it quits and another hometown kindred spirit, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2590-jens-lekman/"" target=""_blank"">Jens Lekman</a>, pared his once-maximalist style down to the nub. Berglund, too, has shed some innocence—he recently told<a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2014/01/09/interview-ceo/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i> The Fader</i></a>, ""I admit—I was an enlightenment noob""—but if <i>Wonderland</i> stops short of promising epiphanies, it's still as luxuriantly widescreen and eccentrically detail-rich as ever. At home with the inevitability of loss, it's an album where you can lose yourself.</p>
<p>That immersion starts with Berglund's always-impeccable pop songcraft. His feel for melodic turns and lyrical conceits is characteristically keen; when you find yourself humming along to the galloping art-versus-commerce ambivalence of ""Whorehouse"", he's got you on his level. Darker thoughts lurk beneath the gleaming surfaces, though—see the dismissal of love as a fantasy on the devastating ""Mirage"", for example. So when the day-glo title track returns to an already-<a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/143172-love-and-do-what-you-will-if-you-keep-silence"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">plagiarized lyric</a> from the first album, ""Love and do what you will,"" the effect is something like, if you'll forgive the terrible pun, going through the looking glass.</p>
<p>Another way CEO lures you into his world is with his distinct sonic sensibility, here at its more atmospheric. The 1980s Mediterranean chillouts of Balearic house still come up a lot as a reference point, and it's a style eclectic enough to make room for almost anything. But beyond that, <i>Wonderland</i> updates Berglund's TTA-predating love of hip-hop to conjure the vibrant haze of cloud-rap pioneers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29865-main-attrakionz/"" target=""_blank"">Main Attrakionz</a>. In the album's wide-eyed viewpoint and bustling intricacy you can also hear an affinity with Japanese pop star <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31566-kyary-pamyu-pamyu/"" target=""_blank"">Kyary Pamyu Pamyu</a>'s psychedelic kawaii-ness. If there's a weakness, though, it's in the handful of wordless or almost-wordless tracks. Like the debut, this album is only eight songs, but floaty interludes like ""In a Bubble on a Stream"" or ""Juju"" allow attention to drift more freely, closer to TTA's super-limited 2006 ambient excursion <i>Escaping Your Ambitions</i>.</p>
<p>Still, with an artist as slyly considered as Berglund, it's tempting to take these space-outs as part of the point. ""OMG"", the album's celestial finale, is also its encapsulation and its peak, juxtaposing reverence with irreverence, a wonderfully goofy boy-meets-girl story with serious-sounding introspection, harp and a choir and a preacher with a pitched-down ""ho"" backing vocal. The full version of the text-speak title phrase is delivered by a female voice resembling an orgasmic version of the main sample in Skrillex's ""Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites"". When Berglund implores, ""Let go forever,"" it's with the tone of the uptight perfectionist—who has said he didn't even like recording vocals in front of TTA partner Henning Fürst—reminding himself his best stuff happens when he goes with the flow.</p>
<p>What can't be put into words is the alchemical trick that some great artists use to turn their personal idiosyncrasies into popular myths, or vice versa. Recognizing this ability in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"" target=""_blank"">Beyoncé</a>'s ""Halo"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a>'s ""Hold My Liquor"" could well be what drew Berglund to cover them, in CEO's typical, colorfully off-kilter way. All three artists use the tools at their disposal, whether stolen or borrowed or hired, to communicate a powerful vision that's ultimately inseparable from its creator. An old Felt lyric once quoted on Sincerely Yours act the Honeydrips' MySpace page goes, ""It's better to be lost than to be found."" Not necessarily, but in the case of <i>Wonderland</i> it comes close. Or as a voice sampled twice on ""OMG"" puts it, ""Who knows, dude.""</p></div>"|18915.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18915-ceo-wonderland/|7.5|Marc Hogan

A few albums later, they’ve flipped the script: </span><i>Too Much Information</i><span>, their newest, eases up on the gas while deepening their commitment to contemplative songwriting.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As a literary exercise, it’s convincing; as a listening one, it’s mixed. The lyrics </span><span>explore the subtextual minutiae within mostly doomed relationships: shadowy dalliances in foreign hotels, drinks shared in lonely bars, tennis matches held at night where something’s going on but no one is willing to say it. Relationships where sustained, wordless glances are part of the package; you know the type. The music is built to match the tone of singer Paul Smith’s voice: the underwater quality to “Brain Cells”, which is concerned with the pressure of having a fun night when you think you might be going mildly insane; the arena-ready “Midnight On The Hill”, which has Smith wondering where the time goes when so much fun is being had. “I Recognise The Light” finds the band at their pugilistic apex, while “Drinking Martinis” strikes the proper melancholy mood for a song about missing someone you used to drink with.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The band is emotionally relatable, if nothing else. On one hand, Smith is a smooth enough singer that he can effortlessly drop a word like ""semaphore"" within the flow of a song. On the other, he’s dropping a word like ""semaphore,"" which begs a mild suspension of disbelief for those who believe rock lyrics should be heard and not seen. Some of these suffer from what you might call Morrissey Syndrome, where the words look good on the page but are paired with listless arrangements, failing to convince through the strength of the music or Smith’s personality. <br/></span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-74f3a152-d940-c357-0587-d2cc63c6b02a"">Coincidentally, one of the songs that works best is the one that sounds most like a Smiths song: “Lydia, The Ink Will Never Dry” rides a ringing guitar line along an epistolary plea toward a former lover. It flips between shimmering and snarling, giving Smith’s fey enunciation a melodic tension that brings his heartache alive. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16728-the-national-health/"" target=""_blank"">Reviewing their last album</a>, Jordan Sargent wrote that Smith “is still much more concerned with the status of his heart and his bed."" Nothing much has changed here, but you wouldn’t exactly ask it to. If the zeitgeist has largely moved on from once angular guitar bands, the romantic world will always want for meticulously rendered stories of love in all its vicissitudes. </span></p></div>"|18908.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18908-maximo-park-too-much-information/|6.1|Jeremy Gordon

Lo and T-Pain linking up with ratchet impresario DJ Mustard in search of a renewed relevance. Los Angeles singer/producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31519-ty-dolla-ign/"" target=""_blank"">Ty Dolla $ign</a> heads up ratchet music’s R&amp;B division; after paying dues producing for Compton stars YG and Problem and featuring on Cali rap records of every stripe Ty finally zeroed in on a sleek, commercially viable sound on his flagship <i>Beach House </i>mixtape series with tracks like “My Cabana”, which crossed a swatch of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"" target=""_blank"">Skrillex</a> with horns lifted off of the R&amp;B band Mint Condition. Last year’s <i>Beach House 2 </i>took a bigger-is-better approach to the lushly produced, impishly explicit sounds of the first installment, soldering famous guests onto remixes and melding unrelated songs into overlong, drippy epics. Sometimes it worked, but all too often it sounded like it was fishing for hits.</p>
<p>Suitably the mixtape’s least fussy song was its biggest hit. “Paranoid” parlayed a spectral Mustard production into a story about a serial cheater caught in the same club with both girlfriends. With “Paranoid” steadily inching up the charts, Ty’s new label Atlantic is capitalizing on its Billboard Hot 100 traction with a retail EP. <i>Beach House</i> the EP succeeds where the mixtape <i>Beach House 2</i> didn’t, further commercializing Ty’s sound without sacrificing the meat and potatoes of it, the foul-mouthed, sex-positivity of Ty’s quixotic bedroom capers and the production’s precarious balance between slight, house-informed ratchet music, trap and densely arranged traditional R&amp;B sounds. Ty’s reigned in some of the thornier aspects of his songwriting for <i>Beach House</i>. The needling insistence of nebulous agency jams “Know Y I Came” and “Zone’n” is scaled back, and the cloying misogyny of “Bitches Ain’t Shit” is carved out, too. In their place we get a Dolla $ign focusing on catchphrases and simplicity. “Or Nah” co-opts a bit of goofy Twitter vernacular as Ty and his Taylor Gang boss <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"" target=""_blank"">Wiz Khalifa</a> fire off randy one-liners over the bed creaks from the Trillville classic “Some Cut”. On “Familiar” he effects a staccato drill flow over ominous production from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"" target=""_blank"">Chief Keef</a> go-to Young Chop and guest verses from Kanye protege Travi$ Scott and Keef underboss Fredo Santana.</p>
<p><i>Beach House</i> largely avoids the mixtapes’ penchant for winding two-part blowouts, too, barring opener “Work” and the double-shot of “Paranoid” that comprise the EP’s front end. “Work” is an excellent showcase for what Ty can do with a longer composition. It vaults from a spoken word intro from Nate Howard to verses from Ty, a guest rap from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29238-odd-future-wolf-gang-kill-them-all/"" target=""_blank"">Odd Future</a> buddy Casey Veggies, and beat and key changes as the viscous, brass-assisted chipmunk soul of D’Mile and D.R.U.G.S.’ beat crystallizes into ambient trap underneath a blistering verse from Twista. The movements flow naturally, and nothing feels as forced as the cute but tacky song transitions of <i>Beach House 2</i>. On the other hand, chasing it with nine minutes of “Paranoid” is a misstep. The single version replaces the original’s stellar guest spot from Ty’s boy Joe Mo$e$ with a tryhard verse from a B.o.B still new to embracing his inner heel. It’s followed by a remix featuring DJ Mustard in full Fatman Scoop hypeman mode, a comically punchdrunk French Montana, and, for whatever reason, Trey Songz. The song’s economy is its greatest strength, and despite the additional guests and tweaks to the beat on the remix, robbing it of its impactful brevity by playing it twice through only serves to drag it down.</p>
<p>The EP closes with another holdover from <i>Beach House 2 </i>in the underlooked nightcap “Never Be the Same”, where Ty cuts the sex talk to beat his chest about his passage from anonymity to budding fame. It’s also his lone production cut in an EP largely aided by Mustard, Cardo, and Brooklyn producer D’Mile. It leads on a blocky video game synth, building on bits of guitar and piano for color until Ty slathers a bed of interlocking vocal runs over top everything. “Never Be the Same” is the wistful hangover breakfast to the rest of the EP’s after hours meanderings, and it’s also proof that Dolla $ign is even bigger than the devilish lechery he’s built his name on.</p></div>"|18964.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18964-ty-dolla-ign-beach-house-ep/|7.6|Craig Jenkins

I’m most familiar with his explorations in minimalist composition, collected on an enthralling </span><a href=""http://xirecords.org/134.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">retropsective</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> of “droneworks” issued in 2010 by </span><a href=""http://www.experimentalintermedia.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Experimental Intermedia</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">, the label run by drone master </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3038-phill-niblock/"">Phill Niblock</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">. That alone is a lot to take in, but it turns out that amidst all these pursuits, he also applied his caution-averse ways to electronic music.</span></p>
<p>In between playing with Taylor and forming the Notekillers, First took a class in electronic music at Princeton, where he got to play a <a href=""http://www.vintagesynth.com/misc/buchla100.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Buchla 100</span></a><span> modular synthesizer. It’s a complex instrument, controlled with touch-sensitive metal plates, which makes it more like “finger-painting” (as First puts it) than keyboard playing. The instrument gave First a chance to create the kind of electroacoustic works that previously could only be made by painstakingly splicing magnetic tape. And even though it was only 1976, according to First analog synths were already out of fashion in academia due to the promise of digital, so he basically had the Buchla all to himself.</span></p>
<p>Judging by the music he made, released as <i>Electronic Works 1976-1977</i><span>, First dove headlong into the Buchla’s possibilities. Each piece is dizzy with activity, as he constantly shifts gears, discovers new noises, and giddily disrupts his own flow. Unpredictability becomes its own motif, and surreal patterns emerge and vanish incessantly, giving </span><i>Electronic Works </i><span>a playful sense of humor. Like electronic pioneer and cartoon-scorer </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15826-raymond-scott/""><span>Raymond Scott</span></a><span>, First knows how to inject both absurdity and drama into abstract electronics, often in the same breath.</span></p>
<p>In fact, the best pieces on <i>Electronic Works </i><span>are the funniest ones. Two tracks that First dubs “Spacey” and “Jumpy”—like outcasts from Snow White’s Seven Dwarves—bounce happily around the stereo space as if chasing own tails. The album ends with another musical character, “Moody”, which is less cartoon figure than dark cloud, fogging its blips and squiggles with wiry leads from First’s guitar. Yet even this track positively bubbles, hopping between sounds like an electronic rabbit.</span></p>
<p>That spastic, boundless energy is the aspect of <i>Electronic Works </i><span>that leaves the strongest impression. I rarely remember sequences or even specific individual sounds after I listen. What I’m usually left with is a kind of caffeinated brain buzz; once First’s relentless compositions get neurons firing, it’s tough to make them stop. That might also be what makes </span><i>Electronic Works </i><span>sound undated—the direct effect it has on your grey matter is powerful enough to cut through decades.</span></p></div>"|18967.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18967-david-first-electronic-works-1976-1977/|7.0|Marc Masters

And ""finger-picking,"" while accurate, feels far too <i>percussive</i> a word for her guitar playing; it's more like she brushes the strings with her fingertips, like wisps of hair obscuring her vision. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O9Kqdf4bMg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Live clips</a> show Byrne performing to reverent groups of three or four in cafes, where she barely rises above the sound of milk steamers and muffled coughing. Her album, <i>Rooms With Walls &amp; Windows</i>, feels like a secret she's keeping from you, even when it is safely in your headphones. If you are listening while walking the streets of a city or while commuting, I recommend noise-cancellation; someone briskly turning the pages of their magazine next to you could drown her out.</p>
<p>Byrne currently lives in Seattle, but she skipped there like a stone across the country—first Buffalo, then Chicago. On ""Marmalade"", she describes what she's searching for: ""All I want is a brick house with a porch that wraps around/ All I want is land enough for my child to roam.""  The language in her lyrics, once it emerges into your awareness, is strikingly conversational, but not like any one kind of conversation. She alternates between vividly dark imagery—""I lean back like a woman baptized in the River of Styx,"" on ""Wisdom Teeth Song""—to the breathlessly naïve: ""The Museum of Natural History in its snow, blood, and fur and ivory/ It left me wanting to know so much more about this world"" (from the same song).  Her delivery doesn't make clear if these sentiments belong to her, or if they are bits of life she's picked up listening to others.</p>
<p>She sings everything in the same cloaked, low voice, and over the same skeletal arrangements, which gives even the mundane sentiments a portentous ring. Her version of folk, a whisper bordering on an ambient hum, will be familiar to fans of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"" target=""_blank"">Cat Power</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a>'s <i>Dragging A Dead Deer Up A Hill</i>, as will her ability to mine the uncanny from the everyday stuff lying around. Byrne occasionally tests your personal boundaries for what constitutes ""enough"" happening in a song: Many of her songs are not only two chords,  like ""Marmalade"", but two <i>notes</i>, hitting  like alternate condensation drops on your forehead while her lyrics follows drowsily afterward.</p>
<p>Some of the most memorable and indelible moments on her album are when she leaves off of words and hums into the ether—at the end of ""Holiday"", after she has sung ""And I do travel alone, but yours is not a number I can call on the phone,"" she follows it with a wordless melody that seems to put a full stop on the enigmatic thought. You can hear it again on ""Prism Song"",  which follows up the hypothetical scenarios of the lyrics (""If you were a prism with the light passing through"") with nothing but a wordless sigh. Sometimes we locate more meaning in sound than in sense, and Byrne's album sits at the nexus where one melts gorgeously into the other. The album concludes with a few glowing rays of synth, an arpeggiated tonalization that sits in place for about four minutes and dies away. The sounds are distant, foggy, and alluring, like echoes of echoes, the original sounding long gone. </p></div>"|18928.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18928-julie-byrne-rooms-with-walls-and-windows/|7.4|Jayson Greene

The phrase was never really championed by the artists it was applied to, in part because its premise was cumbersome and vague, but mostly because it was tied to a particular moment in which country music was understood—briefly and mistakenly—as inherently mainstream. (That idea, at least, has dissipated: anyone who’s ever spent any time pawing through a Used Country LPs bin or listening to “Drinks After Work” knows that country music, as a whole, is completely insane.) Still, in January 1990, when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4416-uncle-tupelo/"" target=""_blank"">Uncle Tupelo</a> steered a dented Chevy van to Boston’s Fort Apache South and recorded their debut full-length, <i>No Depression</i>, traditional country music seemed antithetical to contemporary punk-rock, and the notion that the two might comingle—might be symbiotic bedfellows, even—required a deep philological reimagining.</p>
<p>Our musical imaginations have become larger, the membranes more permeable; now, being equally invested in the Minutemen and Hank Williams doesn’t seem remotely incongruous. Still, <i>No Depression</i>, which takes its name from J.D. Vaughan’s “No Depression in Heaven”, a gospel track first made famous by the Carter Family in 1936 and then by the New Lost City Ramblers in 1959, and which later inspired a magazine dedicated loosely to alt-country and its analogues, is a heady reminder that genre hasn’t always been so fluid. It’s also a reminder of how strange and turbulent an act Uncle Tupelo was: Country and punk are both vulnerable, impassioned, tenuous enterprises, and the places where they overlap are especially combustible. Uncle Tupelo is typically evoked in discussions of the two outfits it birthed (Wilco and Son Volt), but <i>No Depression</i> is a significant record independent of its fallout.</p>
<p>Uncle Tupelo liked to play fast, but even their slower songs are imbued with a kind of frantic inertia, like some wild-eyed goon sprinting across a tightrope, knowing that if he slows down for even a second, he’ll topple. Part of that can be attributed to the experience of being young and loose in the world—Jeff Tweedy and drummer Mike Heidorn were 22 and Jay Farrar was 23 when they arrived at Fort Apache—but the tangling of sensibilities both musical and extra-musical yielded something remarkable: a raw, lonesome clatter, the singular sound of Midwestern kids getting loud and desperate.</p>
<p>There were a handful of other bands doing comparable work (Jason and the Scorchers were blending country and punk rock as early as 1981; in Britain, the Pogues were fusing elements of Irish vernacular music with a rebellious, adolescent ache), but Uncle Tupelo reached a certain cultural flashpoint first. This reissue—which differentiates itself from a 2003 version by collecting 22 previously unavailable demos and live tracks—proffers a good sense of the band’s trajectory, from the halls and parking lots of Belleville, Ill., through stints opening for Warren Zevon and the Band. The bonus material is demo-heavy (it includes all of 1989’s <i>Not Forever, Just for Now</i>, five songs from the 1987 demo <i>Colorblind and Rhymeless</i>, and two songs from <i>Live and Otherwise</i>, a self-released tape from 1988), which will satisfy Uncle Tupelo completists but likely won’t do much for new fans, who might be better served by just listening to the re-mastered record. Farrar and Tweedy, who share most of the songwriting credits, alternate between earnest, romantic confessions (“I woke up to realize it didn’t mean a thing… Give me back that year,” Tweedy hollers in “That Year”) and a populist, blue-collar righteousness likely nipped from Woody Guthrie (even the cover emulates an old Folkways LP). In both instances, whiskey is fundamental (“I got drunk and I fell down,” Farrar and Tweedy sing in an especially effortless bit of harmony).</p>
<p>Nodding to their predecessors (and supposed foes) in Nashville—where writing isn’t necessarily tantamount to performance, and songs are constantly reclaimed, apportioned, sold—Uncle Tupelo never eschewed a good cover, and their take on the Flying Burrito Brothers’ “Sin City” is especially doleful, heavy with a particular kind of resignation: Farrar’s voice sounds sodden, acquiescent, like a kid who’s just been hit in the face with a water balloon. “It seems like this whole town’s insane,” he sings, his voice glum. What Gram Parsons imbued with a mystical, West Coast incredulity, Farrar handles more like a shrug: “The scientists say it’ll all wash away, but we don’t believe anymore.” The sentiment’s sanguine enough, except that Farrar treats the “but” a lot more like “because”: we’ve sinned ourselves into oblivion, and nothing’s gonna keep out the Lord’s burning rain. </p>
<p>Ultimately, worry is the thing that animates <i>No Depression</i> and what, 24 years out, still resonates the most: it’s a part-panicked, part-dispirited, part-defiant reaction to broad social injustices and personal defeats, all the things that make the world seem untenable. The circumstances might reconfigure, but the sentiment remains: life is unfair.</p>
<p>Uncle Tupelo made <i>No Depression</i> for just $3,500 (the studio’s house producers, Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie, lent Farrar the same 1961 Les Paul guitar J. Mascis jammed on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"" target=""_blank"">Dinosaur Jr.’s </a><i>Bug</i>). The band released three more records before splitting—acrimoniously—in 1994. Farrar and Tweedy both went on to lead successful bands, and in the two decades since they parted, reimagining Americana has become its own cottage industry, a fury of wool vests and reconditioned banjos and oiled beards. Alt-country doesn’t mean much anymore because country doesn’t mean much anymore; genre feels like a relic of the record store era, back when hand-labeled plastic dividers still parsed sound into neat categories.</p>
<p>It’s challenging, then, to appreciate the boldness of <i>No Depression</i>, the extent to which the members of Uncle Tupelo insisted on interdependency, on an American story. We don’t have to do that anymore—folks don’t self-identify in the same way, and hardly anyone loves just one genre monogamously—but there’s still something furious and prideful here, something worth hearing.</p></div>"|18940.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18940-uncle-tupelo-no-depression-legacy-edition/|8.4|Amanda Petrusich

And so it goes for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29971-quilt/"" target=""_blank"">Quilt</a>, a young rock band influenced by young rock bands from the 60s. On the Massachusetts trio’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16089-quilt/"" target=""_blank"">2011 self-titled debut</a>, the ghosts of the Byrds, Jefferson Airplane, and Mamas and the Papas were summoned via jangly, well-written pop songs that never strayed far from their harmony-rich melodies. On Quilt’s sophomore release, <i>Held In Splendor, </i>band members Shane Butler, Anna Fox Rochinski, and John Andrews grow more expansive in their instrumentation, blowing out their simple psych-folk ditties into strings-laden multi-part suites that build toward thrilling, guitar-heavy climaxes. It’s a clear progression that nevertheless manages to keep Quilt tucked firmly in the milieu of paisley-colored retro pop-rock.</p>
<p>Lesser groups working the same territory tend to lose sight of their songwriting while in pursuit of just the right Rickenbacker guitar sound or the precise vintage of Farfisa organ. The strength of Quilt’s debut was that underneath all of the flower-power window dressing there were strong hooks and disciplined classicist arrangements. The members of Quilt thankfully haven’t lost those qualities on <i>Splendor, </i>even as many of the songs have grown in sophistication. “Tired and Buttered” begins as an aggressively driving rocker that suddenly downshifts into a dreamy shuffle, and then shifts again into a slowly building rager. The gorgeous “Just Dust” glides seamlessly into the instrumental reverie “The World is Flat”, which showcases the understated but magnetic musical interplay between Butler, Rochinski, and Andrews. The closing “I Sleep in Nature” is another shape-shifter, moving from a discombobulated prologue to a jauntily melodic mid-section that’s pure 60s pop whimsy, albeit with a darkly sinister edge.</p>
<p>Where <i>Splendor </i>diverges from <i>Quilt </i>is in the use of three-part harmonies—while they were all over the first LP, principal singers Butler and Rochinski switch off on lead vocals here. Butler is a more conventional “60s psych-rock dude” singer, favoring an aloof croon on songs like the rather pedestrian “Eye of the Pearl”. Rochinski, on the other hand, has emerged as the band’s star<i>. </i>Her delicate and lilting alto is capable of conveying innocence (like on the album-opening “Arctic Shark”) as well as beguiling sexiness, even when she’s singing nonsense like “planetary truth is born of lightning” on “Tie Up the Tides”.</p>
<p>As Tame Impala proved with its 2012 masterpiece <i>Lonerism, </i>psych-rock still has the power to communicate with listeners not already pre-disposed to care about the genre. <i>Held in Splendor </i>is a good example of a record that successfully executes the tropes of psych—it sounds like it could’ve been recorded in 1967 without directly ripping off any artist in particular—without every truly transcending them. In order to do that, Quilt will have to make an even more ambitious third record. Given its evolution thus far, they are well on their way.     </p></div>"|18903.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18903-quilt-held-in-splendor/|7.0|Steven Hyden

During this period, many people have been eager to assign the city a clear narrative, from the half-dozen or so documentary film crews that have stopped through to the pundits who use Chicago rappers as part of their rhetorical agenda. And while one consistent narrative has emerged—Chicago rap is violent!—the scene has evolved rapidly and dramatically. It's now marked by a fragmented patchwork of genres, microgenres, and individual artist movements—drill, bop, soul trap, acid rap, alternative trap, several types of waves and waviness—that have defied or redefined the narrative completely.</p>
<p>Among the artists who have most resisted easy categorization is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/tags/tink/"" target=""_blank"">Tink</a>, the teenage singer and rapper from the south suburb of Calumet City who has put out four mixtapes of varying tone and quality since early 2012. Her first effort, <i>Winter's Diary</i>, made when she was a junior in high school, introduced her as a sort of potential long-lost member of TLC (never mind that she hadn't even been born during the group's breakout years), a talented, soft-voiced singer with an ear for contemporary rap and an astute emotional awareness. But her first glimpse of success came that summer with the brash, clever rap of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P0Hw0j4p28"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Fingers Up”</a>. Eager to show she was a double threat, Tink then put out <i>Alter Ego</i>, a mixtape full of technically adept but generic raps that, ""Fingers Up"" aside, abandoned much of the unique viewpoint and subject matter that made her such an immediately electrifying presence.</p>
<p>Playing around in the areas between these two poles has helped Tink retain an edge of unpredictability and cater to a broad audience: She's proved her rap bona fides over and over with surgically precise verses like last summer's widely acclaimed <a href=""http://youtu.be/hNMWfXM9yqI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Versace”</a> freestyle. She's shored up her Chicago credibility through collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30216-lil-durk/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Durk</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30546-sasha-gohard/"" target=""_blank"">Sasha Go Hard</a> and established herself as part of the wave of successors to drill music by aligning herself with hard-edged lyrical whiz kids Lil Herb and Lil Bibby. She's captured the attention of the internet's avant-garde, spawning collaborations with artists like producer collective Future Brown and New York rapper Junglepussy. And she's continued to stake out a distinctively young, female voice whether she's expressing the frustration of dealing with flaky lovers or playing at and winning that boys' rap game of pretending you're a drug kingpin.</p>
<p><i>Winter's Diary 2 </i>doubles down on this last point, offering both the most clear-cut perspective and the most accomplished sound of any Tink release yet, delivered with casual charm and easy emotional honesty. The characters in Tink's songs navigate complicated, intimate, and frequently disappointing romantic relationships. They are overtly sexual—take “When It Rains”, a slinky celebration of riding out thunderstorms in bed, which borrows the kind of subject matter normally reserved for grown and sexy album cuts by artists in their 30s (but equally felt by younger people). </p>
<p>They also often find themselves butting up against the gendered expectations of a hip-hop and hustler culture. On the brilliant “Money Ova Everything”, Tink flips the title catchphrase into a couple's joint pursuit, a promise and ultimately a kind of lament. And the back-and-forth of “Talkin' About” with Lil Herb—its lyrical tradeoff and narrative welcome 1990s throwback trope dressed up in modern flows and production—finds a couple arguing about the effects of the guy spending time on the block on their relationship (“I buy my own Prada, man, that's not the problem!” Tink exasperatedly snarls at the suggestion of whose hustling is keeping things afloat). “Dirty Slang”, the clearest pop highlight with its twinkling, synth-driven beat and muscular, Auto-Tuned hook, is a triumphant and flirtatious celebration of a guy who likes hitting the strip club.</p>
<p>Tink's seamless blend of rapping and singing is likely to call to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1944-lauryn-hill/"" target=""_blank"">Lauryn Hill</a>, who are similarly interested in dissecting relationships, but the closest sonic equivalent might be Elle Varner, whose taste for R&amp;B laced with acoustic guitars is echoed here. Like all three, Tink has a strong instinct for finding the emotional core of modern crises. This strength is particularly clear when she's discussing heartbreak, as on the arresting, guitar-backed first single “Treat Me Like Somebody” or in the high, plaintive mantra of “please don't break my heart” on “Fight It”. But it also rings true in other contexts, like the romantic, artfully Auto-Tuned “Lullaby” or the carefully spit celebration of intimacy “Your Secrets.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tink's singing style, which is slight and breathy, lacks power, and her voice can grate when it gets stuck in the same groove for too long. This type of meandering R&amp;B is fine for building a fan base, but it's almost resigned to always being a hit away from stardom. While Tink's choice in production is mostly smart and inoffensive, her skill set would be immensely well-served by collaborating with an A-list producer. <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">And it would be a smart move for one to pair up with her, too.</span> Not only does she have a strong and unique perspective, she has the willingness to write her own story that has helped Chicago's recent breakout stars defy the efforts at categorization and speak to a broad audience. A city's scene is made not so much by having many artists who stick to the same sound but by having many who break out of it, and Tink is a new voice doing exactly that.</p></div>"|18979.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18979-tink-winters-diary-2/|7.6|Kyle Kramer

Williamson’s particular strain of folk is at once earthy and gothic, often seeming haunted by some invisible, vaguely tortured presence—a guitar creaks like an old staircase; the occasional pedal steel lick blows by like a sudden, inexplicable draft. Her songs are loosely structured and rarely have what you’d call verses and choruses; she prefers instead to let them unfurl into strange and twisted shapes. Sometimes she sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29064-angel-olsen/"">Angel Olsen</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom/"">Joanna Newsom</a>, but more often she sounds like a coyote—lonesome and half-rabid, howling into the sparse landscapes of her songs and then pausing, as if she’s waiting for an echo.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Williamson’s debut full-length <i>Native State</i><span> is only seven songs long, but it unfolds at an unhurried pace that makes it feel expansive. She wrote it shortly after leaving New York City for her hometown of Austin (she describes that change as a “period of turning inward and spending a good deal of time alone”), and, fittingly, these songs luxuriate in slow rhythms, compositional elbow room, and moments of quiet introspection. The stirring, macabre opener “Blood Song” begins as though it’s being sung by a sleepwalker (“Who can say what’s really real when there’s a veil between what you kinda see and what you kinda feel”), but it gathers force and vividness as the song moves on. Like Williamson’s most powerful songs, “Blood Song” gives you the impression that you are watching someone weaving on a loom in reverse: as time goes on patterns unravel, solid ground disappears, and by the end the the very bones of the thing lay exposed.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There’s never a shortage of the kind of music Williamson makes. Every generation has its own crop of banjo-wielding mystics singing about astrology, medicine wheels, and long-haired ladies, and—blame so-called hipster culture’s antique shop fetishism, or maybe just the commercial viability of Marcus Mumford—that lane feels particularly crowded right now. But that makes it that much more impressive that <i>Native State</i> stands out among this ever-refreshing crowd. Williamson is particularly good at braiding together nostalgia for the past with a gimlet-eyed (and often bitingly self-aware) view of the present moment. (There’s humor here, occasionally, so subtle and cutting that you might miss it: “I thought I saw something real in Barcelona, in Brooklyn/ But I’ve learned the power now of manic delusions.”) She paints scenes of “moon-bathing ladies” and measures time by Saturn’s orbit, but then chases these lines with expressions of such plainspoken clarity that they almost knock you off your feet: “Here I am at 25 and I can’t sign a lease,” she admits in the last song. “Mostly I’ve survived off people being nice to me.”</p>
<p><i>Native State</i> is often quite dark, so the last two songs—aside from “Blood Song”, perhaps the best she’s released yet—pop up like the first shocks of green in springtime. “You Can Have Heaven on Earth” is a warm, banjo-driven ode to nature (“Try as we must to touch what surrounds us/ All of us thinking what we can’t photograph, we can sing”), but all of the themes of the album really come together in the short, sprightly closer “Seventh Song”. It’s a song about finding a balance between solitude and codependence, between barrelling forward and standing still. <i>Native State</i> is a document of a restless spirit, a wanderer continually searching for the landscape that will best match the thoughts—and the songs—that rattle inside her. But she never romanticizes her wanderlust: She realizes that the very drive that moves her forward could easily result in a lifetime of dissatisfaction. The wisdom of “Seventh Song”, then, is how to find peace in stillness—even if it’s only temporary. You can almost hear the hum of the highway beckoning in the background, but in the album’s final line, she’s found the thrill of its opposite: “Do you know how holy it is/ Just to sit quietly with someone?”</p></div>"|18942.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18942-jess-williamson-native-state/|7.4|Lindsay Zoladz

Before the label got into that game, though, things were a bit more freewheeling, and its compilers and recordists approached sounds not as discrete tracks, or the performers as people with backstories and a place in history, but rather as an ocean of audio to dive into.</p>
<p>That means sounds usually left out of the narrative of global audio history were fair game; the label’s compilations of recordings made off the radio in remote locales were their own brand of audio bricolage, and they could be intoxicating and frustrating at the same time. <i>Radio Niger</i> follows in this tradition. Comprised of recordings of radio broadcasts made by traveler Hisham Mayet in the Saharan country of Niger and edited and sequenced by Alan Bishop, the disc is a swirling collage that captures both captivating music and the sense of play and experimentation with which Nigerien DJs approach their trade.</p>
<p>None of the music is identified. It simply appears as part of the flow of the recording, collaged in among studio and call-in banter in a number of languages. The point of these recordings isn’t to bring us great tracks we might otherwise be missing out on—it's more about the total experience of hearing these sounds and catching a glimpse of what the soundworld of Niger is like a day-to-day basis—but this still merits some discussion. First, what you are hearing is decidedly not what the average Nigerien hears. There is a quantum effect where the observation changes the result, and while Nigerien DJs engage in collage and singing along, both of which are heard here, we don’t get a feel for what a single full broadcast might be like. It is a compressed view. This isn’t a bad thing from an artistic standpoint—the collage is part of the package, and it distills what would otherwise be unwieldy.</p>
<p>The use of the music is more problematic. It is, after all, music somebody made, and to leave it anonymous in favor of a wide-eyed “wow, listen to all of this” approach increases the sense that the musicians playing it are part of some arm’s-length Other and not individuals. That the collage exposes enormous diversity, both sonic and cultural, does little to address this basic flaw. I try to imagine a lawyer for Led Zeppelin hearing one of his client’s songs drifting through a theoretically similar collage made in the Connecticut River Valley and not hitting the “litigate” button, but he hits it every time.</p>
<p>As much as this bothers me, <i>Radio Niger</i> and all of the label’s similar releases do have value, aesthetically and culturally. Niger is a vast and diverse country, monetarily poor but culturally wealthy, and a lot of Americans might only know of it from a reference to yellowcake uranium in a State of the Union Address given by George W. Bush a decade ago. Traditional Saharan string instruments and drums, choral singing and trance music are all part of this audioscape, but they are set next to Auto-tuned pop, Bollywood-influenced songs, rock, and electronic music that more formal compilations often forget exists or try to ignore. The most haunting moment on the disc comes when a bit of spooky, minor-key techno surfaces out of nowhere, and suddenly the world’s hottest desert feels very cold. And that, really, is where <i>Radio Niger</i> succeeds in spite of its flaws: by listening and distilling, it paints a more complete, human and real picture of audio life in Niger than any other single source.</p></div>"|18973.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18973-radio-niger/|7.3|Joe Tangari

I can only imagine that Merge’s decision to remaster and reissue the album embarrassed them, then made them feel humbled, then a little bit corny—such are the old-fashioned values of Lambchop. Where some bands use bonus discs to pump out hot, unreleased material designed to chart the depths of the band's creative prowess, Lambchop offer a brief set by singer Kurt Wagner on French radio and call it <i>How I Met Cat Power</i>. Even when it’s about Lambchop, it’s not about Lambchop.</p>
<p><i>Nixon</i> was released in 2000 and immediately enshrined by the British music press. <i>Uncut</i> named it album of the year, <i>Mojo</i> ranked it 10th, and <i>Q</i> was still doing their lists alphabetically. The band sold out the 2,500-person <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5MbsPqYhXs%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Royal Festival Hall</a> (home of the London Philharmonic), and a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3-fEWh7nZI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zero 7 remix of “Up With People”</a>—the album’s climactic track—made the singles chart. The NME called <i>Nixon</i> “near to perfect” and the <i>Guardian</i> said that the band was “reinventing American music.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, most people in America continued to have no idea who Lambchop were. (“I don’t think [<i>Nixon</i>] made much of an impression on anyone over here,” Wagner told a seemingly baffled interviewer in spring, 2001.) Lambchop’s take on America—sly, tender, mysterious but mundane—is less a realist’s portrait than a surrealist’s impression: funnier, more pathetic, more improbable than what actually exists. In 2007 I met a German man named Frank who told me he loved seeing the band overseas because it meant getting to sit in a plush, quiet room while drinking tons of beer and listening to Lambchop, which I guess he imagined Americans were mellow enough to actually do.</p>
<p><i>Nixon</i> is still an improbable album. The band never sounds like they’re trying very hard and yet every song breaks some convention or another. Despite its showbiz arrangements, the music is tenuous and weird (a contrast that the band toyed with again on 2012's <i>Mr. M</i>), and Wagner’s falsetto—usually the most vulnerable part of a man’s singing range—sounds less like a Romeo than some karaoke loser scrapping for the mic at last call. He says he regrets ever calling Lambchop a country band, and with good reason: <i>Nixon</i> isn't the music of the people, it's the music of the people who showed up, said hello, stood in the corner and left without saying goodbye. (When an interviewer asked Wagner how he felt about the album’s overwhelming reception in the UK, he said, “I’m not sure that’s something to be proud of. I think there are other things in your life you could be more proud of. Like having kids.”) If there's a connection to country, it's spiritual: <i>Nixon</i> finds its humor in self-deprecation and its soul in things broken and left behind.</p>
<p>Even as a fan, I understand the ways in which Lambchop can seem standoffish and cold. “I’m in the thick of it,” Wagner admits on “The Distance from Her to There”. “I’ve been a dick with it/ You’ll get used to it.” Against the sumptuous sounds of reverb, jazz chords, and violins, he sketches out images of drunken neighbors and people peeing on railroad tracks. “The kids out in the street,” goes a line on the album’s opening song, “The Old Gold Shoe”, “take their toys and break them, and look at them and walk away.” There is no poetry here—no embellishment or elevation. This is just the everyday kind of mean you see when you open the window and look outside.  </p>
<p>And yet the secret weapon of <i>Nixon</i>—and of all Lambchop’s albums—is tenderness. “The Book I Haven’t Read”, “The Distance from Her to There”, “Up With People”: these are songs that end up insisting that the world is actually a pretty decent place, not just in spite of the banality and clutter, but because of it. After all the broken toys, the disgusting habits, the broken bottles and falling rain, “The Book I Haven’t Read” ends with the line, “We could be—we should be—in love.”</p>
<p>At its heart, <i>Nixon</i> is an album fascinated by the world at its most fallible and ordinary. “And of that sweet, sweet soul,” Wagner sings on “Up With People”, “Let’s be certain the deliberate monologue/ As sure as if it will fall/ Across you, unto you/ We’ll most certainly leave the doing, the doing undone.” In other words: You’re probably gonna fuck it up.</p>
<p>And yet somehow the song—with its handclaps, high-stepping backbeat, and an ostinato bassline borrowed from the uplifting sound of Motown—plays like a triumph. “We are doing/ We are screwing up our lives today,” Wagner sings on the refrain. Then, with the showman’s point of a finger, he commands a line of gospel singers who go off behind him like fireworks. “Come on, progeny,” they wail, and together, Lambchop enters orbit. Laugh if you want—I usually do. Then, when I’m feeling bad, I draw so close to the song that it starts to sound like a prayer. We all fail sometime. Whether or not we learn to joke about it is up to us.</p></div>"|18826.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18826-lambchop-nixon/|8.3|Mike Powell

Blending wobbly electronics with English folk, he split the difference between the detuned gurgle of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"" target=""_blank"">Boards of Canada</a> and the ethereal emotion of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Drake</a>. He usually seemed misty and pensive, as if feeling his own smallness against the vastness of nature, which he recorded to infuse his productions with dusty space and light. But in 2009, something kind of amazing happened. Bibio hopped to Warp and took a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">J Dilla</a> turn on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13125-ambivalence-avenue/""><i>Ambivalence Avenue</i></a>, mainlining crunchy soul and juicy funk and richly haunting ballads, suddenly as extroverted as he had once been humble.</p>
<p>Just as he tried to linger in that inspired moment on supplementary album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13707-the-apple-and-the-tooth/""><i>The Apple and the Tooth</i></a>, Bibio now strings out last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18006-bibio-silver-wilkinson/""><i>Silver Wilkinson</i></a>—the album where he slipped back into focus, however softly, after the confusing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15279-mind-bokeh/""><i>Mind Bokeh</i></a>—with an EP built, from unreleased archives, around album track ""Dye the Water Green"", where lonesome vocals and gently driving acoustic arpeggios subtly give way to a slinky bass and chimes instrumental. Murky and mellow, the song delivers Bibio just about back to where he began: casting nostalgic melodies down a slow river of bending tape. Second track ""Dinghy"", a bright theme for bobbing guitar counterpoint, calls to mind wispy debut album <i>Fi </i>more than recent work.</p>
<p>Like the album from which it was derived, the <i>Green</i> EP is pleasantly moody, but less impactful than Bibio's increasingly anomalous-seeming 2009 epiphany. At six songs, with half of them three minutes or less, the EP floats by quickly despite its consistently restrained tempos, with the close matching of the new material to ""Dye the Water Green"" smudging over divisions between tracks. For about 25 minutes, it sustains a wistful, low-key atmosphere, punctuated by a couple bolder moments—the storm-threatened ballad ""Down to the Sound"" and the ambient folk of ""A Thousand Syllables""—that feel like more than serendipitous single takes, both recalling <i>Ambivalence Avenue</i>'s haunting ""The Palm of Your Wave"".</p>
<p>Bibio brings a certain refinement and voice to anything he produces now, but that doesn't change the fact that much of the EP is indisputably ad hoc. There's a stern baritone guitar improvisation on album track ""Wulf"", a nice power-trio style instrumental Bibio overdubbed by himself in someone’s rural cabin, a simple 2006 jam with his friend <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/letherette"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Richard Roberts of Letherette</a>, stuff like that. It would be unfair to call them outtakes, too much to call them essential new Bibio songs. <i>Green </i>gives no inkling of what his next phase might sound like, but it's a tidy little stopgap release until he probably surprises us, for better or worse, again.</p></div>"|18944.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18944-bibio-the-green-ep/|6.0|Brian Howe

Their 2012 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16813-whispers-in-the-dark/""><i>Whispers in the Dark</i></a> was a strikingly trendy and sometimes engrossing stew of bass beats that seemed more eager to confound than galvanize. There were few rhythms to groove to and no words to sing along with, but on <i>Divine Ecstasy</i> that changes. Alongside a number of vocal collaborators, Supreme Cuts shoot for the anthemic but come up measurably short.</p>
<p>To be clear, these aren’t exactly pop or R&amp;B songs: instead, they sound like remixed versions of nonexistent singles that were at one point accessible. Accessibility, of course, is both subjective and far from life’s only path, but in trying to mold controlled chaos into actual verses and choruses, <i>Divine Ecstasy</i> gets lost in translation. This is no clearer than on the lead single “Down"", which features members of close Supreme Cuts collaborators JODY. The track clearly aims for the skipping headrush of classic booty bass R&amp;B songs, but landmarks like “My Boo” or INOJ’s “Love You Down” work because of the simple but effective interplay between a sweet, clear vocal and a propulsive, heart-racing rhythm. “Down"", on the other hand, is a disastrous mush of too-fast drums, misty keyboards and muddled bass. It sounds like a demo and probably should’ve stayed as such.</p>
<p>Even the songs here that show flashes of congealing eventually end up falling apart into a watery mess. “Cocktails” has a strong vocal performance from the Portland R&amp;B singer Shy Girls that hits a certain ethereal sweet spot where the unintelligibility of the lyrics only highlights the grace of the melodies. But the production is overly busy to the point of tunelessness—it constantly rattles the song out of what could have been an aching and tense ballad. The same can be said for “Envision"", which features Channy Leaneagh of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30306-polica/"" target=""_blank"">Poliça</a>. The vocal here is not nearly as good, but nonetheless it’s drowned out by a clattering beat. The song, or what could have been a song, completely disintegrates.</p>
<p>Polyrhythms for the sake of polyrhythms is the defining characteristic of Divine Ecstasy. But what Supreme Cuts seem to miss is that the tricky percussion of contemporary R&amp;B legends like Timbaland or Rodney Jerkins always had a place. Timbaland’s drum programming was mind-bending not just because it was almost impossible to understand how it came from a human brain, but because it was <i>always</i> functional. Almost every single song on <i>Divine Ecstasy</i> could have benefited greatly from producers Mike Perry and Austin Kjeultes dialing way back. “Brown Flowers” is case in point: in allowing a stunning vocal from French singer Mahaut Mondino to soak up the spotlight, Supreme Cuts end up with easily the album’s best song.</p>
<p>In ethos and tone, <i>Divine Ecstasy</i> reminds me often of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17625-teen-inc-no-world/"" target=""_blank""><i>no world</i></a>, the neo-soul revivalist album from the duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29728-teen-inc/"" target=""_blank"">Inc. </a>If there was one major criticism of that record is that there wasn’t enough personality—that Inc. was reverent to a fault without having the skill level of, say, Maxwell. But I liked that inc. let <i>no world</i> speak for itself. They made no extraordinary effort to win you over. The songs were more important than being called ""impressive."" On <i>Divine Ecstasy</i>, Supreme Cuts bash you over the head with every single tool in their box. If you last more than one round, consider yourself incredibly resilient.</p></div>"|18937.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18937-supreme-cuts-divine-ecstasy/|4.2|Jordan Sargent

Three of his groups were among the most unique and notorious in the UK underground: power electronics pioneers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4765-whitehouse/"">Whitehouse</a>, who he spent two short stints with; mammoth noise-rock outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4972-skullflower/"">Skullflower</a>, which he co-founded with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Bower"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Bower</a>; and free-improv duo <a href=""http://youtu.be/EdX3nNqFGXo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ascension</a> (disclosure: they contributed to a <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Ascension-2-Broken-Lightbulb-Anal-Fetish-12-The-Tool-Shed-In-Winter/release/931463"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">7-inch</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> I released), which expanded into the quartet <a href=""http://youtu.be/XSOphrKNJtM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Descension</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">. Jaworzyn also helmed the consistently excellent <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/label/39912-Shock"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shock</a> label, issuing stellar experimental titles by </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/906-current-93/"">Current 93</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/967-coil/"">Coil</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">, and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5096-the-dead-c/"">the Dead C</a>.</span></p>
<p>All of this activity came to a mysterious halt in the late 90s, when Jaworzyn ceased making music or doing anything else in the public eye (a recent press release claims he stopped to “focus on drinking and cursing.”) His silence persisted until last year, when Shock re-emerged with a flurry remniscent of Jaworzyn’s hyperactive past. Two solo 12"" EPs married his noise sensibilities to something resembling beats, even danceable ones. Between those came an archival collection of early 80s Jaworzyn material, <i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Eaten Away by Shadows</span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">, as well as expanded reissues of four early Skullflower titles.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">As Jaworzyn was putting together those reissues, he happened upon a tape of solo pieces he made in 1982, recorded at home using a synth and a drum machine. As heard on </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><i>Drained of Connotation</i>, </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">those tracks show that Jaworzyn’s recent shift to more beat-oriented music isn’t an overnight transformation. But the beats here aren’t rhythms so much as they are loops—repetitive, throbbing figures over which he splashes synth squiggles and dissonant blasts. His approach is just as much one of fascination with electronics and tempos as it is with noise and textures.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In fact, Jaworzyn’s fascination with his electronics is what makes </span><span><i>Drained of Connotation</i> </span><span>both an intriguing listen and a minor curiosity. His devotion to riding out drum machine patterns and allowing synth figures time to fully attack and decay can create hypnotic, brain-freezing music. But little here rises above the level of experiment to become something memorable, something that ascends through motion or tension—in other words, something that picks you up in one place and drops you off somewhere else. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">To be fair, crafting musical arcs probably wasn’t Jaworzyn’s goal when he sat hunkered over electronics in his bedroom 30 years ago, so it's misguided to blame </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Drained of Connotation </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">for failing to do so. But I can’t help but imagine that if he had thought of this material as a potential release at the time, he might have worked on building and layering his sounds. Instead, each piece focuses on a single unwavering drum machine rhythm and one synth sound that hews to a narrow tonal range.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Given that restricted approach, it's impressive </span><span>how much Jaworzyn does with so little. On the “Psychoanalytically Speaking, You’re Fucked”, ripping noise-bombs detonate unpredictably over a minimal, millitaristic beat. Even more surprising is “I Am Not Going to Make This Mistake Again”, whose slow, uneventful pace becomes a vital pulse when paired with Jaworzyn’s sheets of heavy fuzz and chopping noise. But the line between vital and mundane is thin: take “Pillars of Excrement”, whose monolithic oscillations are nearly as rote as its plodding rhythm.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That inconsistency is understandable, since this is clearly a collection rather than an album, and expecting it to hang together perfectly could be missing the point. What is interesting about </span><i>Drained of Connotation </i><span>is the implication there are more uncovered sides to an artist who’s already shown quite a few. Hopefully with Shock’s revitalization, Jaworzyn will continue to reveal even more, and </span><i>Drained of Connotation </i><span>could ultimately rank as an interesting footnote to a substantial second act.</span></p></div>"|18950.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18950-stefan-jaworzyn-drained-of-connotation/|6.5|Marc Masters

<p>New album <i>In Roses </i>goes in a different direction: leaving the familiar terrain of Barnes’ living quarters, the band recorded in California, where they worked out of indie rock journeyman John Vanderslice’s San Francisco studio with local producer Minna Choi. The change of scenery and major upgrade in fidelity is immediately evident; this is a much warmer, richer album than its predecessor, and Barnes’ compositions swell and take new shape from the heat. “Michael” drips with the gentle, starlit romanticism of the Antlers; epic closer “Polly” blooms with the help of a softly rolling organ riff that’s ripped straight from Beach House’s playbook. Throughout the album, strings swoop and flit around with a lightness that’s a world away from the mostly solemn cello melodies found on <i>Breakers</i>. </p>
<p>Barnes also takes major vocal and lyrical steps forward. With the help of vocalist Ieva Berberian, he alternates between swaddling his voice in gauzy layers of harmony (“Idea for Strings”) and sprinkling bright flecks of sound around his lead takes, both new wrinkles to his arrangements. And then there's his newfound lyrical focus and clarity. Much of <i>In Roses</i> grapples with queerness in an honest, emotionally unvarnished fashion, whether through explicit nods to old idols—like the aching, mournful “Soft Season”, an ode to the influential gay porn star and ultimate drug overdose victim Joey Stefano—or raw self-examinations like the aforementioned “Michael”, a requiem for a dead relationship that climaxes with Barnes watching his love physically fading away: “I can see it in your eyes/ It’s in your back, your chest/ It’s emotion rise/ It’s the color back/ I can feel it.” His bruising tenderness pairs well with the album’s poignant orchestration, and his perspective is refreshing and welcome among standard and plentiful heterosexual narratives.</p>
<p>While <i>In Roses</i> is a collection of very successful variations on a theme, it doesn’t represent an uptick in Gem Club’s versatility or range. The band may be employing a more varied palette than on previous listeners, but they rarely break from their basic template of vocals-piano-strings, and save perhaps “Michael” the album doesn’t hold the sort of instantly indelible melodies that might pull new or casual listeners into the band’s sphere. Still, the new splashes of color are welcome, and they help to lend <i>In Roses</i> a degree of character that wasn’t always present in Gem Club’s earlier music.</p></div>"|18943.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18943-gem-club-in-roses/|7.1|Jamieson Cox

Earlier this year Hebden opened a <a href=""https://fourtet.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a> account, offering streams and cheap downloads of three early EPs and the full-length <i>Dialogue</i>. The material dates back to the late 1990s, a period when Four Tet was more of a side project for Hebden, with his attention mostly falling on the post-rock emulation of his three-piece band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1563-fridge/"">Fridge</a>. With <i>Rounds</i> symbolizing the moment everything zoomed into sharp focus, this work resembles the obstacles he had to navigate to get to that place.</p>
<p>If Hebden's group work sounded like a bunch of guys who had clutched copies of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a>'s <i>Millions Now Living Will Never Die</i> a little too closely to their hearts, Four Tet hinted at a far wider range of listening happening behind the scenes. All four of these releases came out in the span of a year, but an evolutionary arc emerges over their collected two-hour runtime. Still, there's a lack of clarity, with only subtle allusions to the vision that would ultimately take Hebden out of the small circles he was running in during this era. If that sounds a little harsh, it's a fault he's acutely aware of, explaining in an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9132-four-tet/"">interview</a> last year that his pre-<i>Rounds</i> work ""just sounds like I've heard some records that are really cool.""</p>
<p>Although Hebden is aware of his earlier shortcomings, he's clearly not intent on shying away from them completely. His Bandcamp page in its current state simply contains these four releases plus a series of images, one of which features a Spotify page compressed and turned upside-down. Needless to say, most of Hebden's music is not available on the service at time of writing. Objections to streaming media aside, what we get here are a series of rough sketches that highlight Hebden's obsessions over a particular period. There are trappings of the time, including shades of trip-hop and the cut-up collage of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1113-dj-shadow/"">DJ Shadow</a>, bombastic drum sounds that bear echoes of big beat, and elements of the post-rock grooves Hebden was practicing elsewhere.</p>
<p>These records work as a sort of time capsule. There's a dip into the post-dub sound of the shortlasting <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illbient"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">illbient</a> sub-genre on the first part of ""Thirtysixtwentyfive"", and it's not a stretch to imagine Hebden coming across artists such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1765-dj-olive/"">DJ Olive</a>, <a href=""http://dougscharinmusic.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Doug Scharin</a>, and <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Techno+Animal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Techno Animal</a> during his investigations into the outer reaches of post-rock. He also touches on jazz, with a barrage of sax and drum samples providing a neat loop around to Hebden's future collaborations with drummer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3650-steve-reid/"">Steve Reid</a>. The sense of struggle is palpable at times, indicating someone with a wide open mind who knows where he wants to go but falling just short somewhere between conception and execution.</p>
<p>It's striking just how uneven this material can be, with little pockets of inspiration surfacing amid a tangle of material that shows an artist learning his trade. The tranquil middle section of ""Fume"" from the <i>Misnomer</i> EP has some of the itchy ambience and crisp beats that would become a hallmark of Hebden's later work. But over its 10 minute runtime it also works in hackneyed hip-hop samples and screaming sax that doesn't sit well in the mix, ultimately resembling a junior <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Axg2N1D8V-g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>What Does Your Soul Look Like</i></a> without the same sense of wild exploration. There are other tracks that attempt to pull off the same kind of epic journey-into-sound feel here, but the feeling is of an artist interested in musical transportation without fully having the skills to get there yet.</p>
<p>Hebden's jazz impulses solidify into some of the most satisfying tracks here, notably on ""Chiron"" from <i>Dialogue</i>, which builds off a drum lift from the much-sampled <a href=""http://www.whosampled.com/Bernard-Purdie/sampled/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bernard Purdie</a>, pushing it into a tranquil place that's utterly meditative by its close. Similarly, ""Aying"" from <i>Misnomer</i> (which was tacked on as a bonus cut on the CD version of <i>Dialogue</i>) works as a wonky pile-up of saxophone riffs and jazzy drum fills, gaining a drunken stride that resembles little Hebden has done before or since. It's noticeable that those two tracks are among the shortest over these four releases, with Hebden able to reach greater points of revelation when he got sharper with his editing. He's rarely ventured over the 10-minute mark in his subsequent output; in contrast, the longest track here (""Thirtysixtwentyfive (Part 1)"") last for almost 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The collection signs off with ""Glasshead"" from 1999, which finds a greater sense of purpose than Hebden's prior long-groove efforts. Over 11 minutes he keeps within a narrow frame of sound instead of taking pointless deviations into tiny cul-de-sacs, most of which fit into his self-diagnosed tendency of merely aping other records he liked at the time. ""Glashead"" is far from his best material, but it does hint at a way forward, where all the clutter is stripped from his music, in turn helping to bring out the refinement in his work. Hebden's use of space in <i>Rounds</i> is key to its success. The acres of room between beats in ""Unspoken"", or the way ""Hands"" beautifully drifts into dying embers of glazy electronics, are vital parts of that album. These tracks reflect someone with the ability to deconstruct music history, but yet to find the fantastical place that talent would take him.</p></div>"|18968.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18968-four-tet-thirtysixtwentyfive-misnomer-glasshead-dialogue/|6.0|Nick Neyland

Similarly, ""Aying"" from <i>Misnomer</i> (which was tacked on as a bonus cut on the CD version of <i>Dialogue</i>) works as a wonky pile-up of saxophone riffs and jazzy drum fills, gaining a drunken stride that resembles little Hebden has done before or since. It's noticeable that those two tracks are among the shortest over these four releases, with Hebden able to reach greater points of revelation when he got sharper with his editing. He's rarely ventured over the 10-minute mark in his subsequent output; in contrast, the longest track here (""Thirtysixtwentyfive (Part 1)"") last for almost 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The collection signs off with ""Glasshead"" from 1999, which finds a greater sense of purpose than Hebden's prior long-groove efforts. Over 11 minutes he keeps within a narrow frame of sound instead of taking pointless deviations into tiny cul-de-sacs, most of which fit into his self-diagnosed tendency of merely aping other records he liked at the time. ""Glashead"" is far from his best material, but it does hint at a way forward, where all the clutter is stripped from his music, in turn helping to bring out the refinement in his work. Hebden's use of space in <i>Rounds</i> is key to its success. The acres of room between beats in ""Unspoken"", or the way ""Hands"" beautifully drifts into dying embers of glazy electronics, are vital parts of that album. These tracks reflect someone with the ability to deconstruct music history, but yet to find the fantastical place that talent would take him.</p></div>"|18968.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18968-four-tet-thirtysixtwentyfive-misnomer-glasshead-dialogue/|6.3|Nick Neyland

He's doing this both professionally—alluding to the ""conclusion of the Actress image"" as well as retirement—and artistically. <i>Ghettoville</i>, his fourth album, is a scorched hard drive, a dour drone record that takes his fascinations—Detroit techno, Chicago ghetto house, rap—and repeatedly kicks them in the ribs. This was a calculated move. The album arrived with a press release that sounded roughly like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT_lFIdN6qk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Connor's opening monologue</a> from <i>Terminator 2</i>: ""The machines have turned to stone, data reads like an obituary to its user."" After three slew-footing albums that played Jenga with established genre rules, <i>Ghettoville</i> is content to wallow in the ruins of the musics its predecessors so fascinatingly deconstructed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's difficult to tell how much of Cunningham's end-times blather is bullshit. He's a savvy marketer—he famously referred to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14375-splazsh/""><i>Splazsh</i></a> as ""R&amp;B concrète""—and way funnier than his high-art-golden-boy reputation would lead you to believe. (A <a href=""http://www.thebeatjuice.com/read/2014/01/07/4174/actress-q-and-a/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent interview</a> describes Cunningham as lifting up ""a hefty glass of cognac and look[ing] through it at the flames""; let no one accuse this man of not knowing exactly what he's doing.) But if Cunningham is bluffing, the opener ""Forgiven"" is one hell of a poker face. Seven minutes of plodding, gray loops, ""Forgiven"" refuses to pick its feet off the ground, pouting like a child protesting bedtime by moving as slowly as possible. Lacking any hidden alleys or tricky variations, the track ensures that anyone who hears the remainder of <i>Ghettoville</i> <i>really</i> wants to hear it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Ghettoville</i>'s darker, nastier tone is its defining trait, but the album's lack of dynamism is what's truly alarming. Never before has Cunningham built his tracks out of so few ideas, and never before have those ideas seemed so barefaced and plain. The lumpen funk bassline of ""Rims"" recalls Excepter's more staid moments. ""Towers"", featuring a slow, pulsing kick drum and a single, distorted tone played on-beat, is simple and inelegant. ""Time"" plays like a parody of experimental music: six minutes—and it feels like double that—of wintry stasis interrupted by a flat, lifeless voice repeating the track title. It's probably a joke, the type of musical prank Cunningham has laced his albums with in the past, but it's one performed at our expense.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Ghettoville</i> frustrates most when Cunningham offers the type of transfixing delights he's known for. ""Birdcage"" is a taut piece that allows a flute-like melody to worm in and out of a baffling rhythmic stew. ""Gaze"" proves Cunningham hasn't lost touch with the dance floor, as a sweet, light synth pad ushers along a grimy piano riff and a pattering house rhythm. The deranged mumble that passes for a melody on ""Contagious"" is the one thing sickly enough to justify Cunningham's rhetoric. The spectacular closer ""Rule"" dices MC chatter into an undeniable earworm and places it on a bed of grubby organ chords; it stands as Cunningham's finest and most complete reworking of hip-hop.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Cunningham's work has always offered a crucial interactive component, giving listeners the opportunity to unpack the origins of his musical baubles. If you failed, or just weren't up for it, you were still left with something pleasantly cryptic. <i>Ghettoville</i>'s leaden, idle tracks reject this interaction, so you're forced to take Cunningham at his word: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9310-actress/"">we live in a brittle, addicted world</a>, and this is what a brittle, addicted world sounds like. <i>Ghettoville</i> is a lecture, at least inasmuch as a largely beatless, voiceless work can be. Self-contained, <i>Ghettoville</i> refuses to commune with anything but itself, including the broken and disadvantaged world it purports to represent. Cunningham's perplexing persona has always been overshadowed by his ability to confound us with his records; <i>Ghettoville</i>, disappointingly, shifts that balance.</p></div>"|18946.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18946-actress-ghettoville/|6.7|Andrew Gaerig

The year off not only gave overtaxed fans a chance to replenish their bank accounts, it allowed the hard-working Carney boys a little time to consider their next move. Though by no means a ""comeback"" record, their latest, <i>Innocence</i>, does have a whiff of rejuvenation about it. <i>Innocence</i> serves up to-the-point southern-tinged hard-rock without one iota of pretense; you could call it the most accessible Pontiak record to date, and the Carneys would be <a href=""http://echoesanddust.com/2014/01/interview-lain-carney-of-pontiak/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">inclined to agree</a>.<br/><br/>In Pontiak's case, however, accessibility leads them down a limited path. As Grayson Currin wrote in his review of 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12977-maker/"" target=""_blank""><i>Maker</i></a>, Pontiak do well by ""bending elemental rock'n'roll into warped shapes… [while] putting the song at the center of the conquest."" Pontiak's always been at their best when they're not just kicking out the jams, but by weirding them up, bringing their exploratory tendencies to bear on their amp-destroying sideburns-and-beer-runs riffage. Jamming 11 songs into barely half an hour, the unusually compact<i> Innocence</i> doesn't give Pontiak much chance to stretch out. Trading off between rowdy, riff-crazy, tricked-out-Astrovan rockers and ambling, lighter-flicking balladry, <i>Innocence</i> is a classic Friday night ridearound record. But, with one too many momentum-killing ballads and a riff or two that plod as much as they push, the leaner, occasionally meaner<i> Innocence</i> finds the once-daring Pontiak a couple bongloads shy of a breakthrough.<br/><br/><i>Innocence</i>'s opening trio is, by some distance, its finest stretch. The title track is a smoker, a lurching, pummeling, axis-shifting grove that piledrives its way directly through your skull. After a couple well-earned ""woos,"" ""Lack Lustre Rush"" breaks into a snarly, Southern-fried riff equally suitable for radio and your next blunt ride. A searing space-rocker in the Hawkwind tradition, ""Ghosts"" is a blast, built around long-trail afterburner vocals and a choppy, out-of-nowhere solo. These songs just sound good: taut, punchy, gripping, bite-sized brawlers. If only the same could be said of the next three songs: organ-driven sidewinder ""It's the Greatest,"" countryfied ""Tuesday's Gone""-jocking ballad ""Noble Heads"", and brothers-in-arms shuffler ""Wildfires"". Taken on their own, these are fine—if fairly forgettable—tunes, the kind of thing that have been peppering hard-rock records like <i>Innocence</i> for a good four decades now. Taken together, though, they carve out a considerable mid-LP crater, sapping any and all momentum built by <i>Innocence</i>'s hard-driving opening in a fashion it never quite recovers from.<br/><br/>Mercifully, <i>Innocence</i>'s back half does what it can to right the wrongs of its strangely sequenced opening run. Though the proggy ""Shining"" stumbles a bit before finding its groove, most everything else—the Sabbath-conjuring ""Surrounded by Diamonds,"" the spacey ""Beings of the Rarest"", and the skull-splitting closer ""We've Got It Wrong""—hits the mark. Still, to get all the way to ""Wrong,"" you'll have to drag yourself through the dreary ""Darkness is Coming"", another undercooked, oversung go-nowhere energy-drainer that never quite seems to settle on a hook. Without these stragglers, <i>Innocence</i> would be wall-to-wall riffage. But these slower songs aren't just mellow, they're mundane, and their inclusion leaves <i>Innocence</i> feeling lopsided, a oft-killer rock record with nasty balladry habit.</p></div>"|18906.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18906-pontiak-innocence/|6.0|Paul Thompson

The star track seems clear enough: remix headliner stars like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gish7NbFpGY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lana Del Rey</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3S3mFTZvcE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2 Chainz</a>, get in the good graces/setlist rotation of Hudson Mohawke and Diplo, cop one of those coveted <i>Grand Theft Auto </i>soundtrack slots, and let the buzz build with the same simmering groundswell that his beats possess. His remixes were fine recontextualizations, supplanting the faster/bigger/now structure of the originals' don't-touch-that-dial immediacy with more pillowy melodies and gentler crests. (And sometimes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1OS9WpBLfc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vice-versa</a>.) Once his handiness with the soft-touch approach to bass music became apparent on <i>Mirror Maru</i>, the inevitable questions followed: is he supposed to be the antidote to pop's love affair with post-rave maximalism? A trendy yet point-missing interloper in R&amp;B's space-soul continuum? Just another in a long line of young artists who's going to have to figure out how to evolve in a spotlight?</p>
<p>All that might reveal itself in time, but meanwhile there's another EP to take in. And <i>Wedding Bells </i>ramps up the twinkly, diaphanous, twee little elements in his arsenal—assuming things like fluttery harp glissandos and shivering-puppy vibes can actually be ramped up instead of, I don't know, squeezed out, like some sparkly novelty toothpaste for kids. The sparse, wistful pianos and juddering, mechanically-jointed percussive elements of <i>Mirror Maru </i>were never all that rough-edged or aggro, but the blissed-out vibes have lapsed into a sighing, glassy-eyed stupor with all signs of intensity held back or just outright muted. Too often the beat plinks instead of thumps, and in the moments where it's given free reign to burst out and get things moving it's countered by synthesized permutations of pan pipes (“Wedding Bells”) or toy pianos (“Pearls”). Dance music doesn't need to be a bow-throwing, sweat-flinging mosh-pit soundtrack, but it's hard to overcome the dissonance between heavy bass and fragile melody, even when it's worth trying. Would things be any better if Owl City copped his style off <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29250-girl-unit/"" target=""_blank"">Girl Unit</a> instead of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"" target=""_blank"">the Postal Service</a>? Does that question even need answering?</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's still a fundamental groove backing up Cashmere Cat's stop-start dynamics and his wiseass tendency to turn bass drops into safe parachute landings. His percussive sounds—supple and rattling like drumlines, unafraid to let kicks run free—keep <i>Wedding Bells </i>engaging at those times when it's not merely distracting. And there are still stretches of head-tilting weirdness. The borderline non-verbal vocals in “With Me” and “Rice Rain” are manipulated into quavering swoops of synthesized, inhuman unreality to eerie effect. And when those robot-pixie chirps in that latter track are backed up with a healthy dose of bass/snare/clap buildups and breakdowns, that pushes it into surreally giddy turf. Its ultimate destiny seems to be the soundtrack for an <i>Adventure Time </i>dance party.</p>
<p>But aside from its appropriate feel for a good time get-down in a surprisingly cheerful cartoon post-apocalypse, it's hard to get any real emotional connection from these cuts. Balancing precious, twee cheerfulness and dancefloor-blowout impact is tricky enough when the 4/4 bears down on you constantly. When it slips in and out of rhythmic phase, building up to crests that aren't much higher than the valleys, it has all the disorienting chaos of the most <i>pro forma </i>Skrillexian drop without its chemical-floodgate jolt. So the melodies, whether legitimately stirring or just “pretty” in scare quotes, cause more agitation than elation. If this is the sound of an artist's early phase breaking itself apart, Cashmere Cat definitely has it in him to build the debris back into something deeper and weirder.</p></div>"|18953.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18953-cashmere-cat-wedding-bells-ep/|5.9|Nate Patrin

Some especially brilliant specimens, like Gorguts' <i>Obscura</i>, attain cult-classic status via underground word-of-mouth; other fascinating curios—Confessor's <i>Condemned</i>, Ved Buens Ende's <i>Written in Waters</i>—hang in limbo, championed by a few but unknown outside the underground.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Nespithe</i>, the sole LP by Finland's Demilich (pronounced ""demi-lick""), is one of the latter. It's unmistakably a death-metal record, but compared to what else hit the market around the time of its 1993 release—the year death metal went major label via Morbid Angel's bar-raising <i>Covenant</i>, and a deal between Earache and Columbia that yielded landmarks such as Carcass's <i>Heartwork</i> and Entombed's <i>Wolverine Blues</i>—the record's match of labyrinthine, riff-drunk composition and burp-like vocals registers as outsider art. Even stacked up against fellow Finnish groups Convulse and Demigod, each of whom issued potent debuts filled with relatively orthodox death metal in 92, <i>Nespithe</i> sounds like the work of brainiac obsessives.</p>
<p>Fittingly, <i>Nespithe</i> has a convoluted posthumous history. Several different labels have reissued the album over the years—most recently Spain's Xtreem Music, in 09—and vocalist-guitarist Antti Boman continues to host the album as a free download on his Demilich <a href=""http://www.anentity.com/demilich/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>. So what's special about <i>20th Adversary of Emptiness</i>, a new 3-LP/2-CD retrospective package that includes <i>Nespithe</i> as its centerpiece? First, thanks to a new remastering job, the album sounds fuller and clearer than it ever has—a key improvement, given the head-spinning nature of the songs themselves. Second, the package tacks on everything else Demilich ever recorded—not only pre-<i>Nespithe</i> demos but three unissued tracks from a 2006 reunion—along with beautifully grotesque new cover by original <i>Nespithe</i> artist Turkka Rantanen, a comprehensive interview with Boman, and his annotated lyrics. In short, the package is an exemplary geek-out, the perfect epitaph for a band as alien as Demilich.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Nespithe</i> has lost none of its esoteric allure. Boman's vocals are the first element that leaps out. Unlike the traditional throaty death-metal growl, his delivery seems to originate in his stomach. His tone is absurdly deep but also oddly hollow, almost gaseous. Given Boman's lyrical predilections—the songs are filled with accounts of mastication, vomiting, and putrefaction—it's not hard to imagine him taking perverse pride in sounding like a master belcher. His penchant for anagrams (the album title unscrambles to ""the spine""—or ""the penis,"" if you take a tongue-in-cheek <i>20th Adversary</i> annotation at its word) and outlandish phrasing (sample song title: ""The Sixteenth Six-Tooth Son of Fourteen Four-Regional Dimensions (Still Unnamed)"") only add to the disorientation.</p>
<p>But what's most impressive about <i>Nespithe</i> is the the way the music itself lives up to these attention-grabbing surface features. Demilich was a band obsessed with riffs, and the maximal deployment thereof; they valued crushing groove as much as relentless complexity. It's telling that <i>Nespithe</i> has its own <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcZKzt86Pd0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">supercut</a> on YouTube: The album overflows with thorny, blink-and-you-miss-'em gems: a jagged, dazzlingly precise stomp at 1:35 in ""Inherited Bowel Levitation—Reduced Without Any Effort""; the aggro math-rock workout that erupts at the :45 mark of ""(Within) the Chamber of Whispering Eyes""; the astonishing, rhythmic-obstacle-course entirety of the wordless ""Erecshyrinol"" (""no lyrics here"").</p>
<p>Given the intricacy of the material, it's a marvel that <i>Nespithe</i> rarely sounds frantic. The band clearly drilled the songs until they could let their performances breathe. Drummer Mikko Virnes sounds preternaturally composed and firmly in the pocket amid the songs' extreme-prog contortions; Boman, fellow six-stringer Aki Hytönen, and bassist Ville Koistinen synchronize in high-wire acrobatics or fan out in 80s-style attack formations when one of the guitarists steps up for a tasteful lead or rare solo. Without this level of virtuosity, which aligns Demilich with tech-minded contemporaries such as Death and Atheist, <i>Nespithe</i> could have been a frustrating slog.</p>
<p>Another standout feature of <i>Nespithe</i> is its tenuous relationship to death metal. Blastbeats crop up frequently, but angular, brain-bending groove is clearly the band's wheelhouse. In that sense, they seem more closely aligned with the motley progressive-metal/post-hardcore underground of the mid-80s through early 90s than with their any of their subgenre contemporaries. (A telling photo in the liner notes depicts a Demilich T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan ""Forget Sweden!!,"" signifying that the band felt little kinship with the scene that spawned giants such as Entombed and Dismember.) <i>Nespithe</i> brings to mind Voivod at their proggy peak, American math-rock outliers such as Breadwinner, even the surgically precise morse-code chug of <i>Ozma</i>-era Melvins. As with those bands, Demilich valued insular invention over extremity for its own sake.</p>
<p>Most listeners who catch the <i>Nespithe</i> bug likely end up lamenting the lack of a follow-up. In that regard, <i>20th Adversary</i> both satisfies fans' curiosity and puts it to rest. The 2006 tracks (one newly written song and two old ones the band never got around to recording) make for compelling bonus material. The excellent new offering, ""The Faces Right Below the Skin of the Earth"", affords the chance to hear the <i>Nespithe</i> aesthetic souped up with modern production values. Contrast this with the wealth of appealingly raw-sounding demo tracks, which illustrate how the band's signature style was in evidence from their infancy, juxtaposed with more primitive death-metal impulses.</p>
<p>Still, the pre- and post-<i>Nesphite</i> tracks support Boman's conviction, reiterated in the interview included here, that another Demilich album might have been superfluous. Above all, <i>20th Adversary</i> is a tribute to the definitiveness of <i>Nespithe</i>. Demilich's crazed single-mindedenss—their drive to do this one thing really, really well—couldn't be captured better than it was on their sole LP, which retains its power to baffle, enthrall and, yes, exhaust. The music's eccentricity is both its greatest strength and its most obvious limitation. You don't remember songs so much as segments, sensations—the vigor and meticulousness of the whole package. Would a wealth of new, similarly overwhelming music really enhance the Demilich experience?</p>
<p>On the other hand, <i>20th Adversary</i>'s liner notes and interview do just that, mainly due to the window they afford into the character of Boman, a classic deadpan wit. Asked how he arrived at his signature vocal style, he quips, ""So, sometimes things just happen and mankind gets something beautiful to cherish, like my vivid vocals."" Annotating the lyrics for ""(Within) the Chamber of Whispering Eyes"", he writes, ""No, I didn't know the slang meaning of 'whispering eye' back then""; and of his first effort as a lyricist, ""The Uncontrollable Regret of Rotting Flesh"", he says, ""My good friend, Leo Tolstoy, saw them first… and took some inspiration from them to <i>War and Peace</i>."" Boman's kidding aside, <i>20th Adversary</i> serves as a reminder that the frontman possessed a Lovecraftian gift for dreaming up images of fantastical horror—most memorably, the innocent-seeming backyard ""white stain"" in ""…And You'll Remain… (in Pieces in Nothingness)"", which turns out to be an interdimensional portal.</p>
<p>So will <i>20th Adversary</i> raise the profile of <i>Nespithe</i>, vault it into the realm of consensus cult classics such as <i>Obscura</i>? It's certainly a possibility, given how convincingly the music speaks for itself. In the larger death-metal narrative, though, Demilich will probably never be more than a bizarre bit player—and one gets the sense that the band is perfectly okay with that. To those who vibrate on its weird wavelength, <i>Nespithe</i> remains a godsend; for them, <i>20th Adversary</i> is a priceless keepsake. For everyone else, it's an invitation into one of death metal's most ornate and unforgettable niches.</p></div>"|18966.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18966-demilich-20th-adversary-of-emptiness/|8.0|Hank Shteamer

She has songwriting chops and charisma that dwarf her indie-pop Class of 09-10 peers, and when it all locks together she is capable of stopping time: ""Lord Knows"", from her 2012 EP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17084-end-of-daze-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>End of Daze</i></a> was dramatic enough to make a stroll to the kitchen feel like riding a burning motorcycle off a cliff, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15171-trees-flowers-strawberry-switchblade-cover/"" target=""_blank"">her cover of Strawberry Switchblade's ""Trees and Flowers""</a> was the sultriest that crippling agoraphobia has ever sounded.</p>
<p>However, she's never made the bold, arresting full-length her EPs tease at. Her new album, <i>Too True</i>, is well-crafted, well-written, and immaculate-sounding, but it's a middle-distance affair, exploring some of the same starry skies that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30148-frankie-rose/"" target=""_blank"">Frankie Rose</a>'s last two LPs flitted about in. The songs that let her dip into her dusky lower register raise the biggest goosebumps—mid-tempo ballads like ""Are You Okay"", ""Too True"", ""Trouble Is My Name"". At this level, she can settle into the unfurling, golden lines of melancholy and ache she specializes in, the kind that don't depend on lyrics or context to communicate themselves to you.</p>
<p>Dee Dee's greatest gifts are in sound; her voice, her understanding of how classic pop-rock feels. ""What a vivid sound/ What a vivid sound"" goes the chorus to ""Little Minx"". She sings about ""a lavender haze"" on ""Are You Okay"", which is an apt enough description of her records. <i>Too True</i>, at least obliquely, is a record about sound itself, and the record is sparkling and beautiful, a glittering glaze of guitars and keyboards.</p>
<p>Her songs rarely feel like they're about much, except the other great songs that touch on the same topics, but they are excellent studies. Savoring the details of her craftsmanship is still a pleasure—the middle eight of ""Too True"", the shifts from minor to major in ""In the Wake of You"". ""Too True""'s diaphanous sigh of a chorus and weightless synths sound like they could have come from the last <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27360-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart/"" target=""_blank"">Pains of Being Pure At Heart</a> record, except she double-tracks her vocals into a near-subliminal choir of backing vocals, a touch that feels uniquely Dee Dee. She cares about effort, something that pokes through in one of the only personal-feeling lyrics on the record: ""Why be good?/ Be beautiful and sad/ It's all you've ever had,"" she sings on ""Evil Blooms"".</p>
<p>She'd rather be good. She could be great, though, and she hasn't found her way there. ""Rimbaud Eyes"" is not a terribly euphonious phrase, and the way she sings it, which sounds more like ""Bloomberg Eyes"", highlights the clunk of the phrasing. The song itself is generic, a driving pop-rocker with no stamp on it to distinguish it as Dee Dee's, or anyone's.</p>
<p>The final track, ""Trouble Is My Name"", features one of her favorite sounds, the fuzzy, watery echo pedal strum of ""Crimson and Clover"". She used it on <i>End of Daze</i>'s ""Lord Knows"", where it had a similar eerie power, and it works just as well here. The lyrics are boilerplate, cake toppings—""And you said there was nothing you could do to make your bad turn good""—but they ring like prophecy in her mouth. There are clichés, and there are exalted clichés, and Dee Dee at her best reminds you of this distinction. If she wanted it, she seems to have the potential to knock out a professional world-beater like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"" target=""_blank"">HAIM</a> record. But maybe she's happier in the haze.</p></div>"|18912.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18912-dum-dum-girls-too-true/|7.4|Jayson Greene

A term like “cloud rap” that was an early marker for rappers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30986-kitty/"" target=""_blank"">Kitty</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29865-main-attrakionz/"" target=""_blank"">Main Attrakionz</a>, and even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a> already feels dated from a bygone era of 2011. “Hipster rap,” a similarly small moment used to describe artists as varied as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29310-theophilus-london/"" target=""_blank"">Theophilus London</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Das Racist</a>, was quickly forgotten as rappers fought back against the term or simply reinvented themselves to avoid such genre pigeonholing. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29764-cities-aviv/"" target=""_blank"">Cities Aviv</a>, a rapper from Memphis, has never received such a snappy descriptor for his rap-but-not-quite-always-rap, style. Not embraced by the fashion world enough to be “hipster rap” and not within the correct Tumblr reblog circles to fall into “cloud rap,” he’s existed within his own post-internet lane.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Back in 2011 when Cities Aviv started getting press his music was chiller and more laconic, and lacked the distorted bite that has since taken over his music. A review here of Cities Aviv’s previous release commented that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17456-black-pleasure/"" target=""_blank""><i>Black Pleasures</i></a>: “sounds it's angling for a deal with Pendu Sounds or Captured Tracks.” His latest album <i>Come to Life</i> shows that this particular post-punk angularity remains in Cities Aviv’s sonic DNA, as the album continues to embrace projective shouting and aggressive production. The opening track starts with harsh distortion makes it is clear that this abrasive aesthetic has only grown more ingrained within Cities Aviv’s music over the last couple of years.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">The first single from <i>Come to Life</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16103-url-irl/"" target=""_blank"">“URL IRL”</a>, keeps Cities Aviv’s distorted shouts, but the 1980s styled bounce of the track, makes it one of the most immediate songs since his Modest Mouse-sampling track “Float On”. The upfront nature of his vocals fits closer to his live show, which even with mellower material of 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15563-digital-lows/"" target=""_blank""><i>Digital Lows</i></a> was done with the intensity of rock set, far from just a rapper just rapping over their own pre-recorded vocals. The rest of the album isn’t as straightforward as ""URL IRL"", but at this point Cities Aviv isn’t a performer on record interested in so recognizable hooks; instead, he enjoys hearing how electronics mash with his own vocals. So even when there's an old dial-up modem on “(View 180) Picture Me Gone” or a drum'n'bass break on “Vibrations”, nothing sounds out of place. That references to old internet technology and titles like “URL IRL” and “CTL1” shows Cities Aviv connecting digital dots and hashing through how it affects everyday life. </p>
<p class=""p1"">In 2012 a rapper, more interested in other forms of vocal projections beyond rapping—let’s just ignore Waka Flocka Flame and DMX for a second—might have been perplexing. But in 2014 the rest of the rap community has finally caught up. The industrial clash and shout-rap of Kanye West’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yeezus </i></a>was quickly cited to have come from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29614-death-grips/"" target=""_blank"">Death Grips</a>, but that overlooked a cluster of lesser-known rappers that’ve spent the last few years infusing hardcore punk with rap ideas. Performers like B L A C K I E, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31017-antwon/"" target=""_blank"">Antwon</a>, Abdu Ali (who appears on the track here “CTL1”, talking about his own personal meaning of album title’s “come to life”), and Cities Aviv all have been melding a very B L A C K P U N K aesthetic within rap trappings. They’re rappers only in so far as a being black dude with a microphone and a backing track must be a rapper, instead of maybe being a starting point for their own original style of music. <i>Come to Life </i>shows Cities Aviv putting post-punk, Oneontrix Point Never-like samples (“Realms”), and even a little bit of rap into one holistically new blend. </p></div>"|18933.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18933-cities-aviv-come-to-life/|7.3|David Turner

When Amber Papini surfaced a couple years back with her Brooklyn-based trio Hospitality, it felt like there was another feminine voice working in the same modern-twee vein as Campbell. But it was more than that tidy aesthetic that made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30197-hospitality/"" target=""_blank"">Hospitality</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16213-hospitality/"" target=""_blank"">2012 self-titled debut</a> stand out, so much so that they’ve seemingly abandoned the simplicity on their sophomore LP, <i>Trouble. </i></p>
<p>You can’t blame a band for having aspirations beyond catchy indie-pop about the plight of the 20-something, for moving beyond the lyrical equivalent of the <i>Girls </i>pilot. To be critically applauded for ephemeral toe-tapping must be a frustrating experience for an ex-Ivy Leaguer like Papini; it’s inspired awfully ambitious work in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">Vampire Weekend</a>, after all. On their debut, however, Hospitality exhibited more cleverness lyrically than cussing over punctuation or chronicling campus life. They were underrated, skill-wise, upon their debut, while simultaneously being touted as a ""band to watch.""</p>
<p>The result is a follow-up that makes a point of showing its listeners the difference between ""beautiful"" and ""cute."" There are moments of real beauty on <i>Trouble</i>: A 90-second trumpet feature that soars brightly over an acoustic guitar line that rises and falls visibly like a burly man’s chest (“Sunship”), or the sort of instrumental spawned more by a willingness to let things meander than by technical ability (“Sullivan”). On the latter, cymbals crash as if in slow motion, pianos pipe up at just the right spots, Papini’s voice croons, and guitar lines manifest out of thin air. The whole thing moves in and out as effortlessly as taking a breath, whereas other parts of this album are distinctly not easy. “I Miss Your Bones” recalls the squirmy riffs of Television, and as cool as toughness looks on Hospitality, they’ve only reached that place following extensive live touring as a rock band.</p>
<p>There are a few fun, poppier songs here, too. The appropriately-titled “It’s Not Serious” is a welcome respite to the crescendoes and the instrumental wing-spreading abundant on <i>Trouble</i>. Here’s where we get a taste of that Tracyanne Campbell thing, just a hint of life in a time gone by. But unlike Campbell, Papini’s filling in her sharp observations with recycled imagery, singing here of photographs stashed under the mattress and waiting by the telephone for a guy to call. A Brill Building piano line gives the track a sense of time and place, a façade that’s smashed by “Last Words”, a mostly instrumental song more in line with the saxalicious closer on the most recent Bon Iver album than a Phil Spector production. It’s punctuated with 80s-style synths, another prominent addition to Hospitality’s overall sound. Sometimes, like on “Last Words”, it goes a little too far into dated territory, but in general the variety is a welcome addition.</p>
<p><i>Trouble </i>covers a lot of ground musically, moving through decades and subgenres of pop and rock with each track. But those who listen closely will find a few consistent points of imagery that loosely connect the work: locks and keys, bodies of water, and the telephone. These are things that both connect and separate us from those we love, but for Papini, the vulnerability that accompanies either letting people in or falling apart without them is the real takeaway.</p></div>"|18905.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18905-hospitality-trouble/|7.5|Jillian Mapes

No matter how much one attempts to stay off the grid, eventually something comes up. For example: The second page of Google results for “Morgan Delt” includes a character page for Morgan Delt, the protagonist of an obscure 1966 Vanessa Redgrave-starring film called <i>Morgan—A Suitable Case of Treatment</i>. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_%E2%80%93_A_Suitable_Case_for_Treatment"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Wikipedia describes him</span></a> as “a failed irresponsible leftist artist” who’s obsessed with Karl Marx and gorillas; a characteristic quote from IMDB is something like, “[places skeleton on bed] Man is born to sorrow…”</p>
<p>If this is not California native <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31960-morgan-delt/"" target=""_blank"">Morgan Delt</a>’s chosen pseudonym, it’s awfully telling of an interesting upbringing. He’s a homegrown musician whose debut self-titled album (which includes much of an earlier limited-edition cassette release) evades convenient pigeonholing. There’s the deal with the name, and then there's this: <a href=""http://psychedelicsoundsformysoul.blogspot.com/2013/09/morgan-delt-psychedelic-sounds-from.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>In one of the few interviews</span></a><span> with Delt, the interviewer asks him to explain a song called ""Barbarian Kings"". ""I did have a story in mind with that song,"" he responds. ""I don't want to say too much about it though because what people imagine is usually more interesting. Your version is better!""</span></p>
<p>So, let's go ahead and imagine. In this album it’s easy to hear a band like the Byrds, who dabbled with jingle-jangle proto-power pop, fuzzed out martian rock, genteel country lament, and more during a five-year stretch in which members were swapped in and out depending on the mood. Rather than split time between such distinct states, Delt takes his armloads of sources—beyond the Byrds, you might describe the field of influence as sunny and stoned—and blends them into a variegated, melted mess. The result is a carefully built and naturalistic mosaic—you can hear the influences dissolving into each other even as the resulting sounds are crisp and memorable, rather than the half-baked invention of someone with a killer record collection. Listen to the taped-together percussion on opener ""Make My Grey Brain Green"", which rides a scratchy bass line and flowers into something like the moment when Dorothy's black-and-white world goes RGB. There's the Morricone-meets-Jodorowsky acid drone of ""Barbarian Kings"", the cyclical wobble of “Little Zombies”, the way ""Chakra Sharks"" rattles and crashes through a hornet’s nest of guitars into a wailing refrain of ""Bye bye, farewell."" Throughout the album there’s a heightened, eerie quality to his vocals; the feeling is something like an asylum patient waving to a car as it recedes over the horizon.</p>
<p>That's what I hear, at least. The whole album is so impressionistic and free-floating that you'll likely hear something else, as Delt intended. Projecting where he might go from here, it's not difficult to think of a band like Tame Impala, who temper spacey sprawl with more accessible songwriting. Future development doesn't have to be the point, of course; this album <span>is fully-formed from first listen and begs return trips. There's another interaction from that interview that seems relevant: Asked if he believes in God, Delt simply replies, ""No."" If the faithless create their own meaning rather than wait for divine guidance, consider this an album that forces you to create your own attachments and associations. Even so, the artist is always present, elevating </span><i>Morgan Delt</i><span> from a wispy whatever into a clear statement of intent: It might not be obvious what you're supposed to hear, but you're going to hear something.</span></p></div>"|18904.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18904-morgan-delt-morgan-delt/|7.6|Jeremy Gordon

Patience is a virtue, but that’s about the only unsullied thing about this mangy beast of a recording: Argentinum Astrum have been letting this material ferment for several years now, and it shows on <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i>, a complex, potent concoction.</p>
<p>The three songs here aim to bridge the gap between doom and black metal, and come awfully close on track one. “I” ambles in with a long, rainy intro, sinking into sludgy Graves At Sea territory out of nowhere before falling into lockstep with correspondingly depraved acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30847-dragged-into-sunlight/"" target=""_blank"">Dragged Into Sunlight</a> and Lord Mantis. It feels like an older song, written before its creators decided to stretch their legs and try their hand at something different. It’s a strange way to structure an album, but Argentinum Astrum have always shown their disdain for convention. Soon, the great heaving gasps of sludge on “I” collapse onto the brittle minor chords and anguished howls in the twin black metal pieces that complete the recording.</p>
<p>There’s always been a solid black metal component to Argentinum Astrum, but on “II” and “III,” it takes over completely. “II” is all primal intensity that conjures up associations with Fell Voices (were said Californians unconcerned with the harmonic textures that this band disregard as shimmery melodic frippery), and its successor follows suit. The lead guitar melodies come crackling with a frenetic melodicism that smacks of Cascadian influence as well as Scandinavian flair, swerving sharply towards an ultimately more abrasive sound. By hammering caustic Second Wave tremolo into the more atmospheric riffs, Argentinum Astrum preserve their ferocity without capitulating to boring, rote grimness. <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i> loses points for originality, but makes up for it in execution.</p>
<p>This “best of both world” approach keeps their take on an age-old tradition fresh and compelling, but not too clean: the production values are subterranean, blanketing the recording in a thick miasma of distortion and soot. It’s a DIY jobbie through and through, but that lack of polish is exactly what these songs cry out for. <i>Malleus Maleficarum’</i> sounds far more vital choking on ash than blinking glassily through squeaky-clean guitar tones. Some things just work better when they’re dirty; after all, you wouldn’t hand Andy Sneap a pile of Grave Upheaval demos to polish. Argentinum Astrum know their strengths as well as their weaknesses, and this album is an apt representation of both.</p></div>"|18975.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18975-argentinum-astrum-malleus-maleficarum/|6.5|Kim Kelly

They were born to the Gainesville, Fla., scene as anarcho-punks, wearing black and fully DIY; NOFX's Fat Mike offered the band some money and off they went to his Fat Wreck label, a farm league for the majors where bands could slug Bro Hymns to the kids at Warped Tour. Then Sire offered them even <i>more</i> money so they went up to a major, effectively jettisoning any remaining <i>Reinventing Axl Rose</i> ideologues. And finally in 2010, lead singer Laura Jane Grace (who was then known as Tom Gabel) sang her mea culpa/kiss-off to all those who cried “sell outs,” to those who would go to Against Me! shows and stand there with a middle finger in the air in silent protest wearing studded vests and liberty spikes. She sang on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7RUeMCZL3Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“I Was a Teenage Anarchist”</a> with her own middle finger to the crowd: “You want me to surrender my identity/ I was a teenage anarchist/ The revolution was a lie.”</p>
<p>But identity is a different thing entirely—it's what houses ideology, where ideology goes to gather agency and dig roots. In a rare act, Laura Jane Grace and Against Me! draw a hard line between these concepts with their sixth studio album <i>Transgender Dysphoria Blues</i>. It’s almost kismet for a band who’s been lambasted for not committing to their ideologies to make an album about a real identity crisis. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46454-against-mes-tom-gabel-comes-out-as-transgender/"" target=""_blank"">Grace came out as transgender in 2012</a>, and started writing these songs around that period. They were built out from raw acoustic folk punk into 10 songs of slapdash glam punk that carry great urgency, even those songs that don’t directly concern Grace’s journey. She makes all that cis punk sound limp in comparison.</p>
<p>Good news for early adopters of the band: all that Butch Vig lacquer from their last two albums has mostly been scraped off. The record even opens with a little cowpunk shuffle on the title track to firmly mark a departure from the arena stylings of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10443-new-wave/"" target=""_blank""><i>New Wave</i></a> and <i>White Crosses</i>. Produced by Grace and put out on her own label Total Treble, the band splits the difference between old and new into a compact sound that skews more Sex Pistols than Foo Fighters. It’s comparatively gaunt for Against Me! as of late, but it yields the stage to Grace’s voice, which has never sounded better.</p>
<p>The aggression peaks right at the top, when years of suppression meet the rage in her voice with lines like, “You’ve got no cunt in your strut/ You’ve got no hips to shake” and “They just see a faggot.” It escalates soon after on “Drinking With the Jocks”, where Grace dissembles with and dismantles misogynistic bro culture in about two minutes flat. She sings, “There will always be a difference between me and you” with a little diva flip, the perfect inflection for the album’s key pull-quote.</p>
<p>For every “fuck you” there is an equal and opposite “fuck me,” where all the anger that’s on the surface of the album starts to crack and reveal deap-seated anxiety flowing underneath. Consider that Grace may, as she's <a href=""http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2014/01/inside_against_me_transgender_dysphoria_blues.php?page=2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">discussed</a>, undergo plastic surgery to be who she wants to be, in addition to taking treatments of estrogen, progesterone, and Spironolactone all while confronting stigmas and thwarting skeptics along the way. While never too overtly stated, displacement and shame color Grace’s growl, especially on the MySpace username as song title “FuckMyLife666”, which incidentally reconnects the band with Fat Mike, who plays bass on the track. It really cuts to hear Grace sing from the judgmental third person: “Chipped nail polish and a barbed wire dress/ Is your mother proud of your eyelashes?” Later in the song, she submits another competitor for Tagline of the Album: “There's a brave new world that's raging inside of me.”</p>
<p>If only Grace could rest her <a href=""http://style.mtv.com/house-of-style/20121220/house-of-style-laura-jane-grace-video/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">big black margiela boots</a> on these singular moments, these battle cries for trans culture. The songs themselves are never as daring as Grace herself throughout <i>Transgender Dysphoria Blues. </i>You can feel her breath on your face, taking on the jocks, death (on the acoustic “Two Coffins”), major label execs (“Black Me Out”), and even Osama Bin Laden. She sometimes spirals into the verbose and clunky lyricism that has followed her around her entire career, as on “Dead Friend”, whose words seem untimely ripped from someone still in the gangly throes of grief.</p>
<p>In detours from the title topic, Grace’s anger is scrawled too hard and too sloppy on the page—see “Osama Bin Laden as the Crucified Christ”. Any of the song’s grander metaphors are lost behind the jingoistic chorus, “You’re gonna hang like Benito from the Esso rafters/ Hang like Clara with her skull caved in.” The eye-for-an-eye, boot-in-yer-ass simile is some distance from throwing<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au7ZYAiS0M0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> shade at Robert McNamera</a> on <i>White Crosses</i>. It’s easy to look past occasionally ineffectual production, staid song arrangements, and static guitar riffs when Grace—as she discovers herself on the album—is anything but ineffectual, staid, or static. But when she addresses politics or mortality, the record falls flat and lapses into gawky extremes.</p>
<p>If <i>Transgender Dysphoria Blues</i> was wholly focused on transgender dysphoria blues, it would push aside so much of what Against Me! has built through the years; even in their shortcomings, they remain who they are. But it's fitting that there are facets of the album that refuse to cohere, that don't quite fit right, that flail about in its too-eager execution. These welts are ultimately part of Grace's journey to the depths of self-discovery, and the journey to Against Me!'s true sound, all while playing to the theme of transformation. Punk has always been about disruption of order, and this new revolution that Laura Jane Grace leads doesn't surrender her identity, it reclaims it. This revolution is no lie at all.</p></div>"|18902.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18902-against-me-transgender-dysphoria-blues/|7.5|Jeremy D. Larson

He's existed comfortably there, putting out an album almost every year and building a fanbase, but it's a little difficult to imagine anyone caring deeply about him. His music gestures noncommittally towards a series of ""-waves"": his faltering, conversational delivery is no-wave, his synths are chillwave, his cheap drum-programmed beats are cold wave. All of those waves wash up at Jay's feet, and hey, he's a nice-looking, willowy guy: Tall, high cheekbones, good fashion sense. But his albums have never given us a compelling reason to stick around admiring him for very long. If you're trying to seem hip, winsome, and fashionable, pouting over some old synth presets is quick, easy work, and Jeremy Jay's albums flirt dangerously with falling into this trap.</p>
<p><i>Abandoned Apartments</i> is a shade more nocturnal and forlorn than 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15320-dream-diary/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dream Diary</i></a>. The sound of his records is always immaculate: He has an ongoing fascination with dreams and cinema, and an aesthete's ear for perfect little sounds. There are several such perfect little sounds dotting <i>Abandoned Apartment</i>: The muted tambourine hits opening ""Sentimental Expressway""; the messy guitar solo that airdrops into the last minute of ""Covered in Ivy""; the warm little trill of acoustic guitar opening up ""I Was Waiting""; the ""Cold As Ice"" piano chords beginning ""Graveyard Shift"". Cataloging them, though, points to the big gaps separating them—as strong as Jeremy Jay's ear is, his songwriting chops remain wiry and meager. Songs usually don't develop past their first five seconds, and the album slides back out of your attention field quickly.</p>
<p>""Graveyard Shift"", the first single, is one of the few exceptions. After its opening dusky piano chords, the song smoothly and noiselessly shifts gears two or three times, modulating keys and piling on synth layers until the needle starts to float on the odometer and the song hits cruising altitude. It's one of the only songs on <i>Abandoned Apartments</i> to go somewhere, and the only to hint at the compositional ambitions he professes to having.</p>
<p>""The View From the Train Window"" is another exception, a song built around some winsome staccato guitar chords that snap into place around a muted, burbling bass. Wisps of noise—little guitar leads, glimmering single-note keyboard shimmers—eddy around Jay, who sings a long-breathed melancholy melody. His lyrics are nearly impossible to make out through his bored diction, which swallows the beginning and the end of every word. The yearning phrases that poke through are slogan-like signifiers for mystery, allure, sadness—""Footsteps on a darkened street,"" ""Sometimes you're so far and so near,"" ""When I met you in the metro/ Oh your eyes said baby 'Let's go.'"" People do a lot of waiting for trains, a lot of locking eyes in public places. One or two lines happen across resonant imagery —""Blisters from accidents that never happened,"" from ""The View from the Apartment""—but Jeremy Jay's music is most attractive when he leaves off singing and lets the mood take over. He's done soundtrack work, which seems like the ideal outlet for him; maybe Nicholas Refn could use him. They both seem drawn towards pretty, slightly vacant things.</p></div>"|18898.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18898-jeremy-jay-abandoned-apartments/|5.5|Jayson Greene

The deeply naturalistic <i>Lights</i> finds O'Neil—ex-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17012-rodan/"" target=""_blank"">Rodan</a> bassist, painter, constant collaborator, and tireless solo experimenter—carving scenery out of sound. Yet it's the record's very next line that really gets to the heart of <i>Lights</i>: ""you will not be this shape again."" <i>Lights</i>, her first LP for Kranky, is quite possibly the finest merging of the chameleonic O'Neil's song-based work and her more experimental side. But combing through the catalog for comparison-points doesn't quite get at what makes <i>Lights</i> so striking. <i>Lights</i> is a peculiar thing: impeccably designed, with every thrum positioned just so, yet entirely malleable, different every time you come across it.</p>
<p><i>Lights</i>, like much of O'Neil's solo work, occupies a space between traditional songcraft and more experimental fare, weaving ghostly drones and incidental noises through hushed, unhurried post-folk. Throughout <i>Lights</i>, O'Neil brings the two sides as close as they've ever come before, meticulously plotting out every earthy strum and faraway clatter. Swirling opener ""Welcome"" bleeds a increasingly ominous whoosh into the heavy-lidded, borderline groovy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16257-wordless-in-woods/"" target=""_blank"">""Wordless in Woods""</a>, which makes its way into the slowpoke folk-pop of ""This Morning Glory"". Each move is unhurried, each note is placed just so. But, for all the precision of the arrangements, <i>Lights</i> is the farthest thing from rigid. O'Neil's been careful to leave space in these songs, to let them unfurl at a ruminative pace, to burrow secrets way down in the mix. It leaves <i>Lights</i> feeling practically habitable, a good place to get some thinking done.</p>
<p>O'Neil casts an optimstic glow over much of <i>Lights</i>, but its tone is always in flux. ""Bellow Below as Above"" is an ominous, shapeshifting, just-before-sunrise dirge that slowly climbs its way into a gnarled sort of beauty. Little instrumental exhalations complicate the haunting Brit-folk of ""Elemental Finding"", while the oblong near-slowcore of ""The Signal, Lift"" unwinds over a bed of whispering cymbals, growing more intense by the minute. O'Neil's a fine lyricist—look no further than ""Elemental Finding""—but much of <i>Lights</i>' vocalizing is wordless, evoking feelings rather than spelling them out. <i>Lights</i> is rarely less than beautiful, but between the often-sparse arrangements and impressionistic singing, these abstractions require patience on the listener's part. Give <i>Lights</i> your total concentration, and it opens up completely; start flipping through your phone, and it vanishes into the air. But it's that very pliancy that makes the album so easy to return to; it's harmoniously balanced, yet as liable to change along with the quality of the light, a distressed folk record on one listen, and a sumptuous, swirling exploratory drone record the next. O'Neil's certainly made her share of enrapturing, enveloping music. But I'm not sure she's ever made one quite as transportive—or, for that matter, as <i>alive</i>—as <i>Where Shine New Lights</i>.</p></div>"|18918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18918-tara-jane-oneil-where-shine-new-lights/|7.9|Paul Thompson

This is a fact that's easier to appreciate after spending a half-hour with the bloke-rock quartet’s self-titled debut, because in the split second between knowing the band’s name and pressing play on <i>Drowners</i>, you can be overwhelmed with the daunting influence of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3970-suede"">Suede</a> rather than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes"">the Strokes</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/259-arctic-monkeys"">Arctic Monkeys</a>. It’s your last chance, though, so enjoy it while you can.</p>
<p>Thing is, <i>Drowners</i> is actually plenty enjoyable on its own merits, provided you can look past a derivativeness that’s so naive, it’s almost charming. There are plenty of bands for whom <i>Is This It</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/497-whatever-people-say-i-am-thats-what-im-not/""><i>Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not</i></a> are canonical, formative listens, their <i>Led Zeppelin IV</i>, their <i>Revolver</i>. If you realized that you could sound just like them, you might be pretty stoked, too. Or, you just can’t be bothered to care about Drowners’ obvious debts—after all, neither the Strokes nor Arctic Monkeys have any interest in sounding like they did on their debuts, and someone’s gotta fill the void. Punchy, tastefully scuffed and brief power-pop has decades of service in making handsome, churlish rock-star types seem like likeable losers in love, a proper vessel to convey the confusion, humor, and angst of being taken in and subsequently rejected by faceless, but surely sexy women. Consider <i>Drowners</i> an extreme case of “write what you know,” as Welsh NYC transplant Matt Hitt is not just a model, but a model and rock vocalist named<i> Matt Hitt.</i></p>
<p>That being said, he’s not the only pretty face in the big city, and <i>Drowners</i> makes that abundantly clear. Without being overt about it, Hitt strives to present himself as being no different than any other 25-year old in New York trying to make their dollar stretch. Above all else, Drowners are an economical band, a product of cramped spaces and tight budgets—only one of its 12 songs stretches past three minutes, largely due to Hitt coming up with choruses that are so sticky, they only need to be sung twice rather than three times. The near entirety of <i>Drowners</i> speeds forward at a pace that never achieves the punk’s escape velocity out of radio friendliness but all the same, it moves at a faster clip than most rock music that actually manages some airplay.</p>
<p>And for the most part, Drowners' ability or willingness to recall two and only two bands at the same time is actually pretty impressive; you’d be led to believe that there was no real difference between the Strokes and Arctic Monkeys. Hitt’s accent and phrasing are dead ringers for those of Alex Turner, whereas his slackened melodies and preferred vocal EQ’ing are uncanny<i> Is This It</i>, evoking a gritty, yet liveable pre-Giuliani New York City that doesn’t exist anymore.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, <i>goddamn</i> does this sound like two and only two bands. True, neither of them invented this style of music—<i>Is This It</i> and <i>Whatever People Say I Am </i>aren’t considered modern day classics on originality alone, and as a matter of fact, their lack of originality likely helped, as it allowed critics and listeners to embrace them as a reclamation of rock values in times when things were getting a little too iffy for the old guard. But they did manage to give these old-guard sounds a newfound sense of personality and place. Thanks to self-impressed Moz-isms like “undo another button on your blouse/ these days, you know I rarely leave the house,” here’s what we know about Hitt—he’s young, he’s drunk, and he needs to get laid, but he needs to get up and get out first.</p>
<p>We’ve all been there, but Drowners fails to establish Hitt’s own there, either physically or emotionally. In the first song, Hitt tries to save a relationship while the girl on the other side of the table half-heartedly attempts to “phrase a rejection.” It turns out to be a mutual problem, as Drowners is 12 minor variations of Hitt phrasing his own rejections. “Long Hair” is symptomatic of Drowners as whole, as Hitt is observant without being particularly insightful. He taunts an ex by telling her about the fun she’s missing out on, attempting to convey wasted elegance by noting a party where “all the girls had long hair/and all the boys had long hair.” You know, except for the leather-clad, slightly androgynous woman gracing the album cover, presumably the avatar for all the girls giving Hitt the runaround.</p>
<p>Even still, <i>Drowners</i> can’t inspire too much ill will or really any kind of strong reaction and that’s fair enough: it doesn’t deal in hot, dirty sex or catastrophic breakups, mostly drunken hookups and easy letdowns. Or, maybe they’re just lucky to arrive without any of the usual UK-US hype that accompanies bands of this sort; they lack the eye-rolling savior complex granted to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31056-palma-violets"">Palma Violets</a>, and they’re not as obnoxious as<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29550-the-vaccines""> the Vaccines</a> or clueless as the Strypes. But hell, maybe they could’ve used some of that self-belief; judging from Hitt’s lyrics and <i>Drowners</i> as whole, nice guys might not finish last, but in this game, being an also-ran might be even worse.</p></div>"|18868.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18868-drowners-drowners/|5.8|Ian Cohen

The pair bring that shared understanding to their new project <i>Lord Steppington,</i> a welcome addition to the collection of solid boom-bap rap albums that Alchemist has helmed over the last few years. </p>
<p>Alchemist has been a prolific producer for more than a decade, but as the gangster-rap complex he was once a cog in has evaporated, he's emerged a key player, uniting a host of veterans and young rap nerds alike to create classicist rap music. Starting with <i>Return of the Mac, </i>a 2007 collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30073-prodigy/"" target=""_blank"">Prodigy</a> of Mobb Deep, Alchemist has released a string of solid projects with rappers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30123-boldy-james/"" target=""_blank"">Boldy James</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29043-curreny/"" target=""_blank"">Curren$y</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29181-domo-genesis/"" target=""_blank"">Domo Genesis</a>. What unites these rappers is a reverence for the art form of 90s rap, combined with a welcome dedication to not taking themselves too seriously. Jokes and skits that reek of weed abound on these albums, which add to the sense that you’re listening to a collection of above-average rappers who feel supremely comfortable making music with one another.</p>
<p>That sense is heightened given the relationship between Alchemist and Evidence. The two share an outsider’s take on rap music (which may have something to do with being two of the only non-black kids in their neighborhood). Since their early days of working together, when Alchemist used to craft beats for Evidence’s group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6288-dilated-peoples/"" target=""_blank"">Dilated Peoples</a>, there’s been a sense within their music of striving for credibility. And the way they’ve achieved that credibility is by building an insular world of musical references that’s both dense and possibly invisible to those who haven’t been listening to rap’s odds and ends for the last 10 odd years.<i> Lord Steppington</i> is an album that clowns on Theophilus London’s lips, and Bubba Sparxxx’s country-rap opus <i>Deliverance. </i>It’s an album that refashions the old New Orleans song “Iko Iko” as a mantra full of gangster menace. It is filled to the brim with insider references, so casually delivered in such a non sequitur fashion, that the uninitiated might not even know what was going on.</p>
<p>Not surprising then to hear that this sort of music will work best for those denizens of the rap universe who are well positioned to understand its in-jokes. But Alchemists’ style doesn't rely on stacks of signifiers—he's got that postmodern ability to mine new meaning from old forms and the musicality of <i>L</i><i>ord Steppington </i>should recommend it to those who might be put off by its rap-nerd bona fides. Alchemist’s beats on the album (Evidence only has one producing credit, on “Byron G”) fuse the iron underpinnings of New York boom-bap with either expansive soul or psychedelic edge, or both. The first track here, “More Wins”, may sound like a simple looped sample, but right before the two-minute mark, the full force of the original song comes in and the track shifts on its axis. Elsewhere, “Banging Sound” (more harmless than the name suggests), combines disparate elements: a trippy childlike sing-song for a chorus that contrasts nicely with the descending bassline and minimalist snare on the verses. </p>
<p>The raps often sound equally pieced together but their hip-hop-almanac quality makes them feel familiar, comfortable as worn-out clothing. “Step Masters”, for example, feels like something the Beasties would have made during the <i>Hot Sauce Committee Pt. 2</i> sessions, Ricky Bobby references nestling nicely besides Evidence’s improvised aphorisms (“I ain’t the mover, I’m the man that you hand the cream.”).  The guest apperances contribute to the album’s happy mixing pot; on “Byron G” (which starts and ends with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRljDYzAUSE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a sample of Kanye at the 2008 Brit awards</a>), Domo Genesis spits one of the more tightly wound verses of his still-young career, only to hand the mic off to Scott Caan, who rapped with Alchemist in the Whooliganz  before <i>Varsity Blues</i> jump-started his acting career. Action Bronson, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5555-styles-p/"" target=""_blank"">Styles P</a>, and Fashawn all make appearances, and each sounds relaxed, flowing naturally. Even the easily-agitated Blu sounds at home on the album, keeping Evidence and his fellow Dilated Person, Rakaa, company on the mellow track ""Tomorrow"".</p>
<p>These sorts of fun surprises can make <i>Lord Steppington</i> feel like a Saturday morning cartoon, the kind where a lack of depth doesn't matter because the colors are so bright, the action is so fast, and the jokes are funny. But the album, like so much of Alchemists' recent work, occasionally unleashes a Rembrandt. There are two songs here that astound. The first, “Swimteam Rastas”, is a memoir-esque take on the rap life from a dialed-in Evidence elevated by heavenly chipmunk soul in its middle third. “See the Rich Man Play” is even stronger, with an on-point <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29234-roc-marciano/"" target=""_blank"">Roc Marciano</a> character sketch about a mescaline-addled gambler with the fix in contributing to a three-part meditation on risk.</p>
<p>Songs like these don't diminish the fun collection that they reside in. But they're so head and shoulders above, so exquisitely crafted, that it makes the rockist in me wish we could hear a full album’s worth, something that Alchemist has yet to do with any single collaborator other than Prodigy. (Rap nerds I know have taken to editing together songs from different albums to achieve these results.) <i>Lord Steppington</i> is just the latest remarkably solid offering from Alchemist and co. and the artists involved clearly think of the endeavors as fun and games. Of course, the fun that the artists are having is what makes albums like <i>Lord Steppington</i> work. Still, I’d love to see the Alchemist take a risk and hear the results when things get more serious.</p></div>"|18952.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18952-step-brothers-lord-steppington/|7.3|Jonah Bromwich

While this trend doesn’t run in a straight line—2006’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1871-neil-michael-hagerty/"">Neil Hagerty</a>-produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10139-woke-on-a-whaleheart/""><i>Woke on a Whaleheart</i></a> has a comparatively heavy production touch—he’s mostly done away with reverb, distortion, and processing; his music tends to consist of basic instrumentation presented without adornment, reflecting a confidence that the songs are strong enough to do the work. Last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18491-bill-callahan-dream-river/""><i>Dream River</i></a> was no exception, so it was on one hand a surprise that an advance track prior to the record’s release was a ""dub"" version of ""Javelin Unlanding"" called ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51795-listen-bill-callahan-expanding-dub-a-dub-version-of-javelin-unlanding/"">Expanding Dub</a>"". Dub essentially involves using mixing and effects as a form of expression; the song matters far less than what’s done to it, which initially seemed an odd way to hear Callahan’s spare music. More surprising still was word that Callahan and his mixer Brian Beattie would extend the idea to the entirety of <i>Dream River, </i>creating a dub version of the record, a la <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Protection_(Massive_Attack_album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mad Professor’s re-working of Massive Attack’s second album, <i>Protection</i></a>. </p>
<p>Initial surprise aside, Callahan’s interest in the form makes sense. Classic Jamaican dub from 1970s and 80s is music of great focus and discipline; mixers like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMOl5eqJ-lc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">King Tubby</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y651C7aNXRc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lee ""Scratch"" Perry</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQD4J6a1CEA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Scientist</a> often created instrument dubs for the B-sides of 7"" singles in a single take, re-working the track and adding effects live while the tape of the original song rolled. So once everything was in place, dubbing a four-minute single would take four minutes, with all of the echo, drop-outs, flanging, and various other effects added in real-time. This approach stands in sharp contrast to today’s standard approach to remixing, which uses non-linear digital editing to allow for endless copying, pasting, looping, and processing. A classic dub doesn’t involve any extending of specific sections—the bones of the song are set and the mixer’s job is to shine light on different elements, foregrounding, backgrounding, and transforming, warping time without changing it. Given that, creating dubs using the tools at hand in Jamaica in the 1970s—often four-track tape machines—required a lot of practice and a tremendous amount of discipline. And the best dub can also feel like a celebration of the individual instrument, as parts fall away and you zoom in on the texture created by a simple bassline. </p>
<p>All that squares with Callahan’s approach to sound, and, however it was actually made, <i>Have Fun With God</i> feels like a live, real-time dub. The tape rolls, and the essential arc of each song is unchanged. In addition to the sense of spontaneity, the arrangements of this record lend themselves well to the treatment. Hand drums, flute, and clean guitar lines all lend sound rich in isolation, and light touches of echo, and Callahan’s voice, so front-and-center on his recordings, works well when single words or even syllables are called out and given light touches of effects. It’s also pleasingly disorienting to hear the music of this word-focused artist transformed in such a way that the words don’t really matter—here they mostly become sounds. With a couple of exceptions, where the tracks playfully focus on a key moment in a song (like the call-out of ""beer"" in the opening ""Thank Dub""), there’s no attempt to pay the lyrics any particular attention or amplify the song’s ""meaning."" The approach also underscores the fact that there are some nicely tricky little rhythms pulsing under these mid-tempo songs. </p>
<p>So at its best, <i>Have Fun With God</i> works well as an experiment and as a listening puzzle to work through. If you know <i>Dream River</i> well—and it’s hard to imagine anyone else being interested in this record—you’ll hear new things in it after giving this record a couple of spins. It also seems safe to say that, despite its charms and left-field nature, <i>Have Fun With God</i> will be a minor entry in the Callahan catalogue, remembered about as well as his low-key 2010 live album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14135-rough-travel-for-a-rare-thing/""><i>Rough Travel for a Rare Thing</i></a>, which is not to say I’m not glad both exist.</p></div>"|18866.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18866-bill-callahan-have-fun-with-god/|7.3|Mark Richardson

When he plays piano it sometimes feels like his hands are pulling rigid machine-based structures into a lighter, airier place. Frahm is a musician clearly enamored with benchmark figures from the minimalist tradition (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"">Steve Reich</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass/"">Philip Glass</a>), artists who cross the jazz and classical worlds (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15745-keith-jarrett/"">Keith Jarrett</a>), film composers that lean toward the tropes of early music (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3081-michael-nyman/"">Michael Nyman</a>), and electronic musicians with the lightest of touches (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1472-thomas-fehlmann/"">Thomas Fehlmann</a>). <i>Spaces</i> is a live album patchworked together from various recordings, containing songs both old and new, some shortened, some lengthened, some radically different in approach. Some even stay just as they were.</p>
<p>This is an absorbing work, full of pensive moments cut together by music that thrives on dovetailing melodies that can be simultaneously mesmerizing and beautiful. ""Said and Done"" is the most impressive of these, with a hammering piano motif looping for most of its 10-minute duration as Frahm filters it through textures both light and dark. It's giddy at times, the sound of a creator utterly lost to his work. The occasional burst of applause or audience noise is a startling reminder that these aren't studio works, although it's easy to forget that fact, so meticulous are the arrangements. Moments of humor work as a neat buffer throughout, stopping everything from becoming too internalized—the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OthJ1VGC_EY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jarrett-referencing</a> ""Improvisation for Coughs and a Cell Phone"" is a piece bent around the interruptions suggested in its title.</p>
<p>What's fascinating about Frahm's work here is how he plays with time, working strictly within its limits through tiny repeating motifs, but blowing the overall picture up over such a wide canvas that it's easy to forget how long it's taken to get to where he’s going. The almost 17-minute long medley ""For - Peter - Toilet Brushes - More"" is an example of that idea. Plates of coiling synth sound indebted to the new age markers set down by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22147-jean-michel-jarre/"">Jean Michel Jarre</a> open up the track, before Frahm glides through bursts of rim-shot percussion, arpeggiated synths, and a return to the strident piano of ""Said and Done"". All the component parts work in miniature, based around fragments of sound and ideas that gradually merge into one despite their wildly different roots. The huge burst of applause at the end is deserved, to say the least.</p>
<p>Something that emerges over time spent with <i>Spaces</i> is a subtly shifting dynamic triggered by the way these tracks are recorded. ""Over There, It's Raining"" ostensibly plays out as a pretty low-key piece of neo-romantic yearning. But a large part of its feeling is derived from the tape hiss that muffles at its corners, giving the sentiment a lack of crispness, lending a sense of love and hope gone stale. Even the most forward-thinking track here, the stunning crisscrossing circuitry of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16524-nils-frahm-says/"">""Says""</a>, is far from what it seems at first glance. In a recent <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/13703-nils-frahm-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>, Frahm outlines it as an example of ""what can you do with one delay and an old synthesizer, no computers."" It's hard to picture that basic working method when lost in its complex tangle of glossy electronics, underpinned by myriad counter-melodies that stretch out to unfathomable depths.</p>
<p>For someone as technically accomplished as Frahm surely is, and with so many unique and divisive ideas in mind, <i>Spaces</i> never succumbs to being a set of exercises set to tape. Part of the beauty is in trying to figure out what he's doing and not quite getting there, but mostly it's easy to forget about the way his music is put together and just lose yourself in it instead. Often the charm is, as the title suggests, in the spaces Frahm so artfully leaves between notes. That's an impressive achievement for any live recording—a place where the sweat and sawdust of real life often impinges a little too heavily on otherworldly material, where a layer of fantasy is often shorn away in a manner that can be crude and disillusioning.

If those first two are linked by the psychedelic experimentation and other studio stamps unique to the Jurado-Swift partnership, <i>Brothers and Sisters</i> is a no-bones-about-it sequel to <i>Maraqopa</i>; several tracks reference the mythical locale conjured from one of Jurado’s dreams, and one song is even titled “Return to Maraqopa”. The two records begin in strikingly similar ways, too, far-away acoustic guitar giving way to Jurado’s far-away singing.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Brothers and Sisters</i>, though, is yet another leap into territory that Jurado only touched on previously. Jurado has always been a storyteller, and those stories usually happen in the context of a particular song as he zooms in on the details of his characters’ lives and relationships. They are isolated incidents. Not so this time around. <i>Brothers and Sisters</i> zooms out to tell one story, albeit a fantastical, non-linear one cloaked in sci-fi imagery and layers of mystery. Characters and incidents and themes roll out and twist and wriggle their way through the album. There’s nothing like <i>Maraqopa</i>’s “Working Titles”, a story song that can easily and naturally be applied to Jurado himself: a singer hides from an audience that’s “not in tune with your progress” while someone asks, “What’s it like for you in Washington? I’ve only seen photos of Washington.” The references on <i>Brothers and Sisters</i> are sometimes specific but usually not of this world: geodesic eyes, a ship in the sky, zodiac pain, Jericho Road, Saturn. If the concept-album aspect of <i>Maraqopa</i> was a stretch, it’s undeniable this time around.</p>
<p>The religious overtones are more explicit, too. Jurado doesn’t shy away from his beliefs (“I definitely subscribe to the Christian faith,” he said in an <a href=""http://apesontape.com/damien-jurado-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> about <i>Maraqopa</i>), and the Biblical references are all over this record. There’s the Christ-evoking title, and on “Silver Katherine” Jurado sings, “I have seen Him… pacing through the sky”; he ends the track singing, “Roll away the stone.” Allegory is everywhere in this dream/vision/hallucination, but it’s not the type of C.S. Lewis allegory in which we’re meant to have an aha moment. Sure, Aslan is Jesus, but I have no clue who Silver Timothy is. Or Silver Donna, Malcom, or Katherine. And don’t count on a big reveal that unlocks a way to understand the veiled “magic number” by the time the album closes. Yet these mysteries are curiously addictive more than they are frustrating.</p>
<p>Jurado has taken many left turns in his career, from the stark, dark folk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4324-rehearsals-for-departure/""><i>Rehearsals for Departure</i></a> to the toe-tappers on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12773-caught-in-the-trees/""><i>Caught in the Trees</i></a>, so at this point it shouldn’t be surprising that he continues to take chances. But you probably never imagined Jurado getting quite as funky as he does on the six-minute “Silver Donna”—the clicky guitar line and punchy, multi-tracked falsetto giving it a danceable groove. Jurado’s voice is usually recognizable more for its warble than its punch, and there’s still plenty of well-placed warble here. But this more adventurous stage of Jurado’s career isn’t just studio trickery. He often <i>sounds</i> like a new man, too.</p>
<p>“Silver Timothy” is the strongest track on <i>Brothers and Sisters</i>, and the prominent claves give it a distinct Latin feel. These moments of genre jumbling litter the record as they did on <i>Maraqopa</i> (though I wouldn’t make too much of Swift’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frnWPrDu9CU&amp;"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">comments</a> about dub and reggae influences; he most likely hears it more than you will), and the melange works in much the same way. The psychedelia and ghostly sounds make their way onto recordings because of the liberation inherent in Jurado’s work at Swift’s studio (aptly named National Freedom), but they remain on the final version of the record because they fit. Swift and Jurado didn’t throw everything against the wall in hopes that something oddly beautiful would emerge. They arranged it in such a way that odd beauty is communicated.</p>
<p>In lesser hands the quiet “Silver Katherine” and “Silver Joy” could seem out of place, like an anachronistic return to the spare singer-songwriter fare of Jurado’s early work on an album otherwise engaged in chance-taking. Instead, it’s sequenced as a welcome breather—a respite right before the cloudless chamber-pop fadeout of final track “Suns in Our Mind”. The album ends with Jurado singing, “Over there beyond the words, we are all we dream of,” a callback to a similar, earlier line: “Words are not needed.” It’s hard not to apply some of these lyrics about language to the album itself, since some of the words crucial to following the action of this story are never even sung, relegated to parentheticals in the liner notes (e.g. “after the accident,” “return to the crash site,” “heavy limbs / paper medicine cup,” “welcomed at the gate”). If anything, though, it shows how comfortable Jurado has become experimenting with new sounds and structures in this partnership with Swift. He has <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frnWPrDu9CU&amp;"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> he used to <i>dread</i> making records, and he doesn’t anymore. The freedom and comfort Swift provide seem to increase Jurado’s confidence on each outing, and it’s not unfounded.</p></div>"|18926.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18926-damien-jurado-brothers-and-sisters-of-the-eternal-son/|7.6|Joel Oliphint

Let these six tracks rip from your stereo system of choice, take a step back, and you’ll hear a fevered, hostile trip through top-heavy doom and harsh noise. The lulled wallop of “Rhetoric of No” is tremendous, with thunder drums cracking against wide-sky riffs. The death metal shivers that erupt and dissipate throughout closer “Disambiguation” shake the frame, while the reptilian invective of founder and chief screamer Dylan O’Toole slices across any space. Now plug in headphones, and step forward into Indian’s tumult. The mountainous sludge is still there, as is the squall. But the balance has shifted, and the subtleties become evident: In “Directional”, faint, hostile harmonies crisscross with a storm of electronic viscera, sandwiched between the dual guitars that chase O’Toole’s lead and the rhythm section’s trouncing momentum. During “Rhetoric of No”, the drums trace O’Toole’s voice like a vigilante trailing a target, the rhythm emphasizing every shift the leader makes. It’s not complicated. It’s just nuanced, the condition that makes <i>From All Purity</i> more than a loud record with good riffs and belligerent intentions.</p>
<p>During their decade as a band, any change or progress with Indian could best be described as stepwise, despite rather drastic membership changes: Aside from an obvious production upgrade and enhanced self-editing, there’s little difference in style and content from 2005’s <i>The Unquiet Sky</i>, a ricocheting wrecking ball of feedback and distortion, and the new <i>From All Purity</i>. They flirted with rudimentary din then (“Shill”), again on 2008’s <i>The Sycophant</i> (“Allotriophagy”), and even added a member credited simply with “noise” on their <a href=""http://indiandoom.bandcamp.com/album/guiltless"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">most recent</a> album, 2011’s <i>Guiltless</i>. On <i>From All Purity</i>, they are once again a quartet, with former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4783-wolves-in-the-throne-room/"" target=""_blank"">Wolves in the Throne Room</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5803-nachtmystium/"" target=""_blank"">Nachtmystium</a> guitarist Will Lindsay re-enlisting to split guitars and vocals with O’Toole. To counterbalance the standard four-piece setup here, though, Indian recruited <a href=""http://bloodlust.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mark Solotroff</a>, the mastermind of the destructive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31852-bloodyminded/"" target=""_blank"">Bloodyminded</a>, and Sanford Parker, a producer who has long gone beyond the rote responsibility of plugging in microphones and hitting the big red button.</p>
<p>Their roles are most obvious on “Clarify”, a late-album showcase of sorts for Solotroff’s distorted realities. Indian generally line their riffs with cacophony; here, they invert the approach, bathing enormous amplifier growls with toxic noise that wheezes, gasps, and chokes. It’s a brilliant, caustic burst, but it’s also a smartly retroactive signpost for how the album works as a whole. After hearing “Clarify”, the depth of the rest of <i>From All Purity </i>becomes obvious. Yes, “Rape”, which opens the album, is a malevolent tantrum, suggesting the brittle shapes of Eyehategod and the fomenting wrath of Khanate. But Solotroff lingers just beneath the cresting guitars, feathering their feedback with static tips. And in the passing moments where the song collapses, his electronics shape a sort of Rubicon that the crew summarily dares you to cross. Solotroff appears only on those two tracks and “Directional”, but the idea remains even without him: This is highly involved and evolved doom, with layers and finesse betraying a veteran band. There’s a sustained screech just beneath “The Impetus Bleeds”, creating a sense of inescapable claustrophobia. Ron DeFries plays his bass so loudly that it sounds as though his amplifier is dying, bleeding out beneath the song. And the guitars of “Disambiguation” sometimes mimic a blizzard musically, creating a sound so thick you can’t hear or even think beyond them.</p>
<p>In the era of infinite and instant online content, listeners can rush to judgment with wanton speed. A new song that’s played in some remote club one night can proliferate across the internet by the next morning, with a tantalizing headline attached. Twitter answers with ad hoc ratings and analyses. That creates the pressure to change, setting up a crucible for hyperkinetic evolution that means you’re only as good as the last YouTube video someone posts of a song you’ve yet to finish. Indian, who have existed at least until now on the fringes of their peers’ rising popularity, are a testament to an older, slower mode of growth: Hide away, change slowly, and emerge eventually with something as commanding and well-crafted as <i>From All Purity</i>. This is an album whose every layer seems customized, whose every crease seems deliberate. That calculation doesn’t seem to have mitigated Indian’s power at all. Rather, this is the strongest they’ve ever sounded <i>and</i> the smartest they’ve ever sounded—a blunderbuss paired to a brain, both fully operational. </p></div>"|18827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18827-indian-from-all-purity/|8.2|Grayson Haver Currin

The decision to move in a less kinetic direction was partly made for him by the 1971 factory accident (and subsequent bungled treatment) that left him debilitated. But the Drag City reissues of two of his early-70s albums—the solo disc <i>Michael Lee Yonkers</i> and the team-up with his former bandmate Jim Woehrle titled <i>Borders of My Mind</i>—show just how much country and folk were part of Yonkers’s idiosyncratic musical worldview.</p>
<p>This is still Yonkers, though, so the stuff is still twisted. As on <i>Grimwood</i>, his first post-Miniature Love album, <i>MLY</i> and <i>Borders</i> were self-released in 1974 despite being recorded somewhat earlier. <i>MLY </i>was tracked in 1971 and 1972, and it continues with diminishing returns the lo-fi vibe he established in <i>Grimwood</i>, which was recorded in 1969. The 60s may have been over, but the trip wasn’t. Awash in the kind of thudding reverb that can only come from living-room walls, the disc is a scarecrow-stark affair, an assembly of acoustic lullabies topped with Yonkers’s goatlike cowpoke vibrato. “His bowels were trembling,” he croons crookedly on “My Sally,” and it’s as silly as it is skeletal. It feels more pastiche than anything else, though, and its Johnny Cash rumble rides off from time to time into <i>Rawhide </i>territory. Yonkers’s stab at a murder ballad, “I’m So Glad You Came"", isn’t weird enough to be poignant or funny enough to be weird, but instead inhabits a holding pattern between lighthearted and halfhearted.</p>
<p><i>Borders</i> fares better. Recapturing some of <i>Grimwood</i>’s quivering psychedelic headspace, it reunites Yonkers with Woehrle, who had been a member of Yonkers’s pre-<i>Microminiature </i>garage combo Michael and the Mumbles as well as the original lineup of The Michael Yonkers Band. Woehrle left the group just before the recording of <i>Microminiature</i>, but the alchemy between the two old friends is gloriously uneven. Relearning each other’s ropes as they go along, each half of the duo contributes songwriting duties. The result is rife with beautifully ragged seams. With Yonkers on feathery guitar and Woehrle on shaky piano, the twosome harmonizes in a near medieval mode on “Elaine"", a “Scarborough Fair” for hungover hippiedom. But it’s the grainy, eight-minute “Lovely Lady Companion” that most tenderly demonstrates <i>Borders</i>’ hushed camaraderie. “Please be with me when I reach the end,” they sing together into the single microphone through which everything is being captured.</p>
<p>Neither album, however, hits the same outsider heights as <i>Microminiature</i>, let alone Drag City’s other 70s-folk finds such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2043-gary-higgins/"" target=""_blank"">Gary Higgins</a>’ ghostly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4017-red-hash/"" target=""_blank""><i>Red Hash</i></a>.

These two albums have more depth and edge than that. Yonkers, after all, has an off-center perspective that fuses gaunt-eyed soulfulness with quirky perversity.

The Los Angeles quartet's <span id=""docs-internal-guid-1a31f458-980b-6f61-954b-f6152180c2f0""><span>2010 debut </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14801-the-fool/""><i>The Fool </i></a><span>certainly got them to an admirable level of success, albeit one where having either Flood produce or Nigel Godrich mix the follow-up would be a serious coup; nearly three years in the making, </span><i>Warpaint </i><span>has </span><span><i>both</i>. <span id=""docs-internal-guid-1a31f458-980c-fb4d-01f4-ad75d32ff8ce"">Acclaimed video director Chris Cunningham is on board as well, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52634-warpaint-announce-self-titled-album-share-love-is-to-die"">contributing the arresting visuals for first single ""Love Is to Die""</a> as well as the cover art. Judging from the talent involved, this all sounds like a massive, star-making rollout from the second Clinton term and unfortunately, <i>Warpaint</i> plays the part too well. Digging in the used CD crates to exhume hours of rightfully ignored post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12938-pablo-honey-collectors-edition-the-bends-collectors-edition-ok-computer-collectors-edition/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><i>OK Computer</i></a> paranoid androids, catatonic trip-hop, and gluttonous Francophile ambience, <i>Warpaint</i> spends 2014 remembering everything 1999 tried to forget.</span></span></span></p>
<p>But for all of Warpaint’s fashionable aesthetics and packaging, they're a most square thing: a jam band. And not even a jam band in the fairgrounds-conquering sense most understand it, where typical verse-chorus structure serves as a jumping off point for indulgent, technically flashy solos. The thrill of seeing Warpaint’s uncanny, egoless instrumental interplay in a live setting didn’t always translate on <i>The Fool</i>, though the record did serve as a good preview. There, Warpaint went past mere jamming, <i>conjuring</i> music into existence, hazy vistas of desert blues, cavernous post-punk, and disembodied, ghostly vocals, summoned to create alluring mirage rock.</p>
<p>But on <i>Warpaint</i>, the band goes from raising spirits to the embalming business, adding layers and layers of polish to lifeless stiffs. To their credit, they haven't changed their compositional approach; though the sound is vastly more lustrous, expansive, and expensive, each individual player is emphasized in a manner that emboldens the group collectively. In her first record since joining the band, drummer Stella Mozgawa is mixed as a lead instrument, and Lindberg’s bass is often tasked with not just the melodic framework, but the actual melodies. Meanwhile, the vocals of Emily Kokal and Theresa Wayman are given crystalline spaces of their own to act as texture, while their guitars are either padding or swapped out for whooshing synthesizers. It’s a total inversion of pop music, which seems to have been the point.</p>
<p>And like every guitar-based band as of late, Warpaint have stressed that they’ve spent the past four years listening to anything but guitar-based music, seeking out as much R&amp;B and hip-hop as possible. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/03/warpaint-manchester-academy-review"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">They’ve called <i>Warpaint</i> a mashup with Jay-Z. They also called <i>Warpaint</i> their <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>.</a> They’re not exactly wrong—the ponderous, bottom-heavy tempos of <i>Warpaint</i> are a triangulation point between space-rock and rap. But while trip-hop has long been derogated as functional lifestyle music, it began as a forward-thinking deconstruction, and the difference between the titans of the genre to which Warpaint has been errantly compared (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead"">Portishead</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack"">Massive Attack</a>) and the forgotten second tier were the same things that guide pop music from time immemorial: a compelling vocal presence, innovation, a perspective, or more briefly, <i>songs</i>.</p>
<p>The way Warpaint hopscotch through the tricky guitar figures on “Keep It Healthy” is satisfying from a technical standpoint, as is the syncopated, hollowed-out riff of “Biggy” or any number of their muscular rhythmic structures—it’s all the work of accomplished musicians, a rare proficiency that never devolves into showmanship. But the arrangements twist themselves into knots Kokal and Wayman can’t untie—vocal melodies invariably bob, weave, dip and dart, trying so hard to find a sliver of space that they never resolve into a memorable pattern. For the most part, Warpaint take the path of lesser resistance, lapsing into the same layered coos that defined <i>The Fool</i>, but now that they’re mixed to be a focal point, the melodic inertia makes <i>Warpaint</i>’s 51 minutes feel three times as long.</p>
<p>“Teese” slumps its way towards a chorus that recalls <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHgHrJ17XkE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dot Allison’s “Colour Me”</a>, though I’m not suggesting that Warpaint are trying to pull a fast one on us. The problem is that “Teese”, like so much of <i>Warpaint</i>, instantly reminds one of a third-wave chillout chanteuse. “Love Is to Die” stands out for having some kind of verse-chorus structure, as well as the most discernible bit of ineffectual relationship balm (“Love is to die/ Love is to not die/ Love is to dance”). There’s almost no way to make a smooth segue towards that gawky, tuneless hook, and yet, the pivot from the key in the verse is especially awkward.</p>
<div>More troubling than the lack of hooks is the way Warpaint operate in their new, immaculate surroundings like they’re worried about a security deposit, barely leaving a fingerprint on these air-streamed synths, let alone getting their hands dirty. They try to create atmosphere in an airlock, lumbering instead of fostering groove, failing to generate any heat or friction as nearly every interesting turn on these songs happens within the first minute. Even with Godrich and Flood at their disposal, Warpaint work within a limited dynamic range, relying on a busier cymbal pattern or the introduction of a slightly different synth to instigate a tonal shift, but never a crescendo. Their melodic and textural limitations are even more pronounced when during their protracted genre experiments. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia"">M.I.A.</a>-style enunciation and warping vocal effects of “Disco // very” are every bit as forced as the titular pun, but rigorously scheduled playtime is better than none at all. “Drive” similarly makes its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15908-various-artists-drive"">source material</a> all too obvious, and it sounds even <i>more</i> dated than its surroundings, a big-budget rendering of the handcrafted, Italo-inspired dark pop whose moment just disappeared in the rearview.</div>
<p>Even those sympathetic to what Warpaint are doing have all but admitted this album lacks hooks, grooves, or even a pulse most of the time—relying on the idea of it as “grower” or an “immersive experience.” But the question never gets answered: to what end are we indulging these jams? As pop, it’s unconscionably tuneless, as transportive space-rock, it’s not analog enough to be charmingly retro, and certainly not futuristic. The lyrics are symptomatic of <i>Warpaint</i> itself, failing to impress or even engage, assuming distance and emotional vacancy necessarily equal “mystery.” So even as a proxy for makeout sessions, it fails—it sits completely still and makes <i>you</i> do all the work. It fittingly does make its demands in a very late-90s way, assuming its status as a limited resource (i.e., a big-budget rock album from an up-and-coming band) for a captive audience either tuned into MTV, the local alternative radio station, or just $17 in the hole and demanding some kind of return on investment. But as the saying goes, time is money and <i>Warpaint</i> is the sound of both disappearing into the void.</p></div>"|18892.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18892-warpaint-warpaint/|5.7|Ian Cohen

The most rebellious act of his youth was a note politely informing his tutor he was leaving school. His musical career was a disaster, but not a funny or entertaining one—his albums were simply ignored and audiences talked obliviously through his live gigs. He moved back home, fell into a deep depression, and one night, either by accident or on purpose, took too many pills. When he died, there was almost nothing to feel good about.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This has proved a difficult predicament for the record labels charged with profiting off his legacy. The posthumous marketing of Nick Drake's music has been arduous and fitful, a decades-long attempt at setting right what everyone agreed went horribly wrong the first time. First there was 1979's overpriced <i>Fruit Tree</i> box, which bombed. Then came the slightly more successful 1985 best-of <i>Heaven in a Wild Flower</i> and 1986’s <i>Time of No Reply</i>,  a collection of rare and officially unreleased tracks. His cult profile rose modestly through the 90s, but it wasn’t until 2000, when “Pink Moon” famously found its way into <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIOW9fLT9eY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Cabrio commercial</a>, that Nick Drake's fortune as a ""penniless genius"" finally received its uplifting footnote. Since then, there has been a flurry of release activity, all of it packaging the same tiny body of work spanning six years. Nick Drake is finally famous, but it took the record industry 40 years to figure out how to make it happen.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's worth revisiting this dubious history while considering<i> Tuck Box, </i>the latest and possibly final repackaging. Alongside his three studio albums—<i>Five Leaves Left</i>, <i>Bryter Layter</i>, and <i>Pink Moon—</i>this boxed set includes the 2004 compilation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2445-made-to-love-magic/"" target=""_blank""><i>Made to Love Magic</i></a>, (itself a barely altered repackaging of <i>Time of No Reply</i>) as well as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10391-family-tree/"" target=""_blank""><i>Family Tree</i>,</a> a 2007 collection of Nick Drake's home recordings with a few short, haunting songs by his mother, the folk singer and poet Molly. There is not a single second of new or unreleased music waiting for you inside this handsomely designed object, in other words; the packaging, which replicates the wooden box that Nick Drake’s mother used to send him cakes in while he was at Marlborough College, is the sole original flourish.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What <i>Tuck Box</i> offers, then, is simply another chance to revisit Nick Drake's short, sad story. Because Drake died in desolation and obscurity, and because his music grows more influential every year, there will never quite be a <i>bad</i> moment to rediscover him. His three studio albums have settled into cultural totems, albums that anyone hoping to know something about rock history buys sooner or later. Even 40-odd years later, their thumbprint remains unique, a strange and compelling mix of timeless poetic melancholy on the one hand, and cloistered, pampered schoolboy modernity on the other. They sit completely to the left of all rock music, which Drake could care less about; his version of a garage band was a group of boys at his boarding school, one of whom was the grand-nephew of John Maynard Keynes. (Their name was the Perfumed Gardeners.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Drake was influenced instead by British folk royalty like John Martyn and Bert Jansch, or Ashley Hutchings of the Fairport Convention. When he recorded his debut, 1969’s <b><i>Five Leaves Left</i></b>, he must have felt, at least momentarily, that he was joining their ranks. It was Hutchings who had enthusiastically approached Drake in local pub The Roundhouse, offering to pass his information along to the legendary manager Joe Boyd. Drake's entrance into the business, at least, was effortless and auspicious, and he was joined in the Sound Techniques recording studio by a few of his personal heroes. The warm, rounded upright bass playing is from Danny Thompson, a founding member of the Pentangle. Richard Thompson plays the pearly guitar leads. Listening to “Time Has Told Me”, the first song on his debut album, is to hear to what might very well be the happiest and most fulfilling moment of Nick Drake’s professional life.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Even as a 20-year-old, Drake's vision for his music was strikingly assured. He was nervous, fumbling, and difficult to engage in conversation in the studio, but he knew what he wanted. He calmly insisted that Boyd and John Wood hire arranger Robert Kirby, a fellow student at Cambridge. Bewildered, they obeyed, and were rewarded with the breathtaking string chart for “Way to Blue”. With its clean lines and grave elegance, ""Way to Blue"" suggests the philosophy that would distinguish Nick Drake’s music over the years and damn it during his lifetime: in Joe Boyd’s words, it simply  “was not reaching out to you."" Drake was painfully English, and showiness wasn’t really in his nature. But profundity glowed from his music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This approach extends to his guitar playing, which was so obsessively perfect it almost escapes comprehension. You will never hear a single string buzz. It's not the sort of virtuosity that quiets a chattering crowd, but once you've attuned to the absolute silence, it quickly grows otherworldly. Even on densely packed fingerpicking runs like ""Day Is Done"", each note sits in the mix like a stone at the floor of a clear pond. He was a frighteningly flawless player, in a way that served to magnify his incorporeality: There is no surviving video of Nick Drake playing live or talking. He died in 1974, but his physicality is as remote to our modern imagination as Gustav Mahler's.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">His concerns were similarly otherworldly and timeless, informed by a childhood of English Romantic poets. The futility of knowing the mind of another was a persistent theme in his lyrics, which looked right past people to stars, trees, eternity. “Who can know the thoughts of Mary Jane?” Drake muses. “Who can know the reason for her smile?” His music viewed human behavior and its peculiarities with quizzical detachment, even when the case study is Drake himself: “So I'll leave the ways that are making me be/ What I really don't want to be,”, he sings on ""Time Has Told Me"". Sizing up the enormity of this task, examining how it might be accomplished—these were not really his philosophical concerns. They overwhelmed him or they simply didn’t interest him, but either way, they came to trip him up, as they do us all.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When it was released in the fall of 1969, <i>Five Leaves Left</i> went unnoticed. Island Records had done it no favors. The packaging was insultingly botched; two songs—""Day Is Done” and “Way To Blue”—were switched in the tracklisting and “Three Hours” was mistakenly titled “Sundown”. But Drake was also complicit; he began his first ill-fated tour behind the faltering album, and between songs, he would tune his guitar for minutes on end to stony, uncomfortable silence. He often walked off dejected before finishing his set. He disappeared into dope smoke, a predilection that was slowly hardening into a crutch. He blew off radio sessions and interviews and slowly began retreating into himself. It was under these circumstances that he ventured back into the studio for <b><i>Bryter Layter</i></b>, his second full-length.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ironically, it was initially conceived as his ""up"" album, a poppy rejoinder to <i>Five Leaves Left</i>. <i>Five Leaves</i> was pastoral, written in the wooded confines of Cambridge. <i>Layter</i> was written in London, and was meant to reflect urbanity. It did, but only from the perspective of Drake's one bloodshot eye, peering out cautiously at the world. Over woolly saxophone on ""At the Chime of a City Clock"", he confesses ""I stay indoors beneath the floors and talk with neighbors only/ The games you play make people say you're either weird or lonely"". Over the peppy horn charts of ""Hazey Jane II"", Drake sings lightly of how it feels ""when the world it gets so crowded that you can't look out the window in the morning."" The city, on <i>Bryter Layter</i>, is one long harsh unpleasant noise occurring outside. Nothing good or stimulating seems to happen there.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The music, however, is brighter—this is the Nick Drake you can hear reflected in latter-period <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"" target=""_blank"">Belle and Sebastian</a>. He rehearsed with a band for the first time, including other members of Fairport Convention, and the result is the most fulsome studio recording he ever managed. Some of the arrangement decisions remain bewildering—the gospel backup vocals, jazz-comping guitar and noodling piano crowding the space on ""Poor Boy"" remain as jarring now as they were when the album was released. On ""Fly"" and ""Northern Sky"", Drake worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/649-john-cale/"" target=""_blank"">John Cale</a>, and you can hear a more natural dynamic in their collaboration. It's either a shame or a relief they didn't work together longer: ""Fly"" and ""Northern Sky""are the two most affecting songs on <i>Bryter</i>, but it's also likely Cale introduced Drake to heroin.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On <b><i>Pink Moon</i></b>, Nick Drake’s final official album, there is one single overdub: the piano part drifting over the title track. The rest is just Drake, his pristine, eerily perfect playing, his mumbling, and silence. <i>Bryter</i> had also sold poorly and received near-zero notices—the most favorable review compared it to ""Classical Gas"". By now, he hardly spoke to anyone; in between takes, John Wood remembers, Drake betrayed neither pleasure or displeasure. He simply sat. Keith Morris, the photographer who shot the album's photography, remarked that working with Drake was ""like working with still life."" The album was recorded in two evenings, by his bewildered crew, who were uncertain of what they were even making. When Drake was finished, he dropped the manila package, almost without a word, at Island Records.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A ""pink moon"" is a baleful symbol, a sign of impending death or calamity. On ""Pink Moon"", it's ""gonna get ye all."" On paper, this sentiment reads like vindictive rage, but on record, it sounds contemplative. Drake's voice never conveyed palpable anger or sadness; he had a slight, gentle voice and upper-class accent, the product of his upbringing, clipped and clean, and his guitar, as always, rang out with a crystalline purity. His music is so consoling that the darkness at its heart is not always accessible. It's almost impossible to hear the emotional abandon in <i>Pink Moon</i>, then, without the taste of his first two albums lingering on your mouth. It's only then that the bone-dry resonance of the guitars registers as slightly alarming, and the backdrop of silence suggests both the purity of Drake's vision and also something darker: like someone who has dropped out of the world, mumbling prophecies.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On ""Place to Be"", he remembers his youth only as a time he ""didn't see the truth hanging from the door""; now, he is ""weaker than the palest blue."" ""Know"" consists of just four lines—""You know that I love you/ You know I don't care/ You know that I see you/ You know I'm not there."" It sounds like a back-and-forth between Drake and the world at large. There is a stillness to Nick Drake's music that bewitches anyone who gets near enough, and <i>Pink Moon</i> is its purest expression. It remains the Nick Drake record most people begin with, and for good reason.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The eleven songs on <i>Pink Moon</i> were not Nick Drake's final recordings, however. In the last year of his life, he would return to the studio, his fingernails long, his hair dirty, his clothes in shambles, to cut beginning tracks for what would have been his fourth album. They went poorly. Joe Boyd recalls that Drake, the flawless technician, was no longer able to play and sing at the same time, so the sessions limped agonizingly while he fumbled through guitar takes and then returned to sing, shakily. These four songs—""Black Eyed Dog"", ""Rider on the Wheel"", ""Tow the Line"", and ""Hanging on a Star""—are the only truly discomfiting records he ever made. On ""Black Eyed Dog"", he sang tremulously over some hammered harmonics about growing old and wanting to go home. Within four months, he was dead.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The most consequential material on <b><i>Made to Love Magic</i> </b>remain these final tracks. The sundry unreleased tracks, such as the hallucinatory “Clothes of Sand” and the odd, jaunty “Mayfair"", are interesting but inessential. The rest of the album is the usual posthumous footnotes tumble: A version of ""River Man"" recorded when Drake was still at college; a scrapped version of ""Three Days"" from the tentative early sessions of <i>Five Leaves Left</i>; an early alternate take of ""Thoughts of Mary Jane"", with distracted, noodly lead guitar playing from Richard Thompson. There are a handful of performances from Drake's first-ever public concert, the so-called ""work tape"" from his college days. They don't do much to enrich the Nick Drake story.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><b><i>Family Tree</i></b>, though, is odder and more interesting. The album, which was only released in 2007, compiles all the known existing home recordings of Nick Drake—music he recorded at his parents' house for fun or to kill time; rehearsals of Mozart trios with his aunt and uncle (he played clarinet). The 28 tracks consist largely of covers and traditionals, including a run through ""All My Trials"", sung with his sister Gabrielle.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Family Tree</i> doesn’t give the world any classic lost Nick Drake music, but it does give the sensation, achieved with a little effort, of what it might have been like to sit in the Drakes' parlor in Far Leys. You can hear the actual clink of actual tea cups in the background of his cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Dylan</a>'s ""Tomorrow Is a Long Time"". You get to hear Nick Drake messing about on guitar, which sounds better than anyone else's. His version of ""Cocaine Blues"" is enjoyable  both because it's a looser and bluesier Nick Drake than we're used to, and also because of his pronunciation of ""cocaine,"" which suggests a side of finger sandwiches.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Family Tree</i> also includes two of his mother's haunting, intriguingly wayward songs. ""Poor Mum"" makes for an odd companion with her son's ""Poor Boy""; ""Joy as it flies cannot be caught"", she sings, searchingly, her voice climbing into a breath-catching question mark. There is an unmistakable hint of the fatalism that trailed her son's music in these recordings, and in ""Do You Ever Remember"", she sings lines that could lead directly into ""Time Has Told Me"": ""Time was ever a vagabond/ Time was always a thief/ Time can steal away happiness/ But time can take away grief.""</p>
<p>This was Nick Drake's existential dilemma: He would rather ponder time than observe the present, would sooner gaze into the sea than engage with the people around him. School friends recall conversations about spirits and ""the little people"" as the only times they saw him animated. The rage he directed at his producer Joe Boyd for his failed career on ""Hanging on a Star"" (""Why leave me hanging on a star/ When you deem me so high""?) was in part the sound of someone realizing that their worldly woes have slowly blotted out their view of the stars, perhaps forever. ""I could have been a signpost, could've been a clock,"" he mused on ""One of These Things First""; this is the sentiment of someone who barely assented to the burdens of being a person. For such a soul, there can never be such a thing as a career. There can only be a legacy.</p></div>"|18793.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18793-nick-drake-tuck-box/|8.5|Jayson Greene

The rest of the album is the usual posthumous footnotes tumble: A version of ""River Man"" recorded when Drake was still at college; a scrapped version of ""Three Days"" from the tentative early sessions of <i>Five Leaves Left</i>; an early alternate take of ""Thoughts of Mary Jane"", with distracted, noodly lead guitar playing from Richard Thompson. There are a handful of performances from Drake's first-ever public concert, the so-called ""work tape"" from his college days. They don't do much to enrich the Nick Drake story.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><b><i>Family Tree</i></b>, though, is odder and more interesting. The album, which was only released in 2007, compiles all the known existing home recordings of Nick Drake—music he recorded at his parents' house for fun or to kill time; rehearsals of Mozart trios with his aunt and uncle (he played clarinet). The 28 tracks consist largely of covers and traditionals, including a run through ""All My Trials"", sung with his sister Gabrielle.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Family Tree</i> doesn’t give the world any classic lost Nick Drake music, but it does give the sensation, achieved with a little effort, of what it might have been like to sit in the Drakes' parlor in Far Leys. You can hear the actual clink of actual tea cups in the background of his cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Dylan</a>'s ""Tomorrow Is a Long Time"". You get to hear Nick Drake messing about on guitar, which sounds better than anyone else's. His version of ""Cocaine Blues"" is enjoyable  both because it's a looser and bluesier Nick Drake than we're used to, and also because of his pronunciation of ""cocaine,"" which suggests a side of finger sandwiches.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Family Tree</i> also includes two of his mother's haunting, intriguingly wayward songs. ""Poor Mum"" makes for an odd companion with her son's ""Poor Boy""; ""Joy as it flies cannot be caught"", she sings, searchingly, her voice climbing into a breath-catching question mark. There is an unmistakable hint of the fatalism that trailed her son's music in these recordings, and in ""Do You Ever Remember"", she sings lines that could lead directly into ""Time Has Told Me"": ""Time was ever a vagabond/ Time was always a thief/ Time can steal away happiness/ But time can take away grief.""</p>
<p>This was Nick Drake's existential dilemma: He would rather ponder time than observe the present, would sooner gaze into the sea than engage with the people around him. School friends recall conversations about spirits and ""the little people"" as the only times they saw him animated. The rage he directed at his producer Joe Boyd for his failed career on ""Hanging on a Star"" (""Why leave me hanging on a star/ When you deem me so high""?) was in part the sound of someone realizing that their worldly woes have slowly blotted out their view of the stars, perhaps forever. ""I could have been a signpost, could've been a clock,"" he mused on ""One of These Things First""; this is the sentiment of someone who barely assented to the burdens of being a person. For such a soul, there can never be such a thing as a career. There can only be a legacy.</p></div>"|18793.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18793-nick-drake-tuck-box/|9.5|Jayson Greene

The most rebellious act of his youth was a note politely informing his tutor he was leaving school. His musical career was a disaster, but not a funny or entertaining one—his albums were simply ignored and audiences talked obliviously through his live gigs. He moved back home, fell into a deep depression, and one night, either by accident or on purpose, took too many pills. When he died, there was almost nothing to feel good about.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This has proved a difficult predicament for the record labels charged with profiting off his legacy. The posthumous marketing of Nick Drake's music has been arduous and fitful, a decades-long attempt at setting right what everyone agreed went horribly wrong the first time. First there was 1979's overpriced <i>Fruit Tree</i> box, which bombed. Then came the slightly more successful 1985 best-of <i>Heaven in a Wild Flower</i> and 1986’s <i>Time of No Reply</i>,  a collection of rare and officially unreleased tracks. His cult profile rose modestly through the 90s, but it wasn’t until 2000, when “Pink Moon” famously found its way into <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIOW9fLT9eY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Cabrio commercial</a>, that Nick Drake's fortune as a ""penniless genius"" finally received its uplifting footnote. Since then, there has been a flurry of release activity, all of it packaging the same tiny body of work spanning six years. Nick Drake is finally famous, but it took the record industry 40 years to figure out how to make it happen.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's worth revisiting this dubious history while considering<i> Tuck Box, </i>the latest and possibly final repackaging. Alongside his three studio albums—<i>Five Leaves Left</i>, <i>Bryter Layter</i>, and <i>Pink Moon—</i>this boxed set includes the 2004 compilation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2445-made-to-love-magic/"" target=""_blank""><i>Made to Love Magic</i></a>, (itself a barely altered repackaging of <i>Time of No Reply</i>) as well as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10391-family-tree/"" target=""_blank""><i>Family Tree</i>,</a> a 2007 collection of Nick Drake's home recordings with a few short, haunting songs by his mother, the folk singer and poet Molly. There is not a single second of new or unreleased music waiting for you inside this handsomely designed object, in other words; the packaging, which replicates the wooden box that Nick Drake’s mother used to send him cakes in while he was at Marlborough College, is the sole original flourish.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What <i>Tuck Box</i> offers, then, is simply another chance to revisit Nick Drake's short, sad story. Because Drake died in desolation and obscurity, and because his music grows more influential every year, there will never quite be a <i>bad</i> moment to rediscover him. His three studio albums have settled into cultural totems, albums that anyone hoping to know something about rock history buys sooner or later. Even 40-odd years later, their thumbprint remains unique, a strange and compelling mix of timeless poetic melancholy on the one hand, and cloistered, pampered schoolboy modernity on the other. They sit completely to the left of all rock music, which Drake could care less about; his version of a garage band was a group of boys at his boarding school, one of whom was the grand-nephew of John Maynard Keynes. (Their name was the Perfumed Gardeners.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Drake was influenced instead by British folk royalty like John Martyn and Bert Jansch, or Ashley Hutchings of the Fairport Convention. When he recorded his debut, 1969’s <b><i>Five Leaves Left</i></b>, he must have felt, at least momentarily, that he was joining their ranks. It was Hutchings who had enthusiastically approached Drake in local pub The Roundhouse, offering to pass his information along to the legendary manager Joe Boyd. Drake's entrance into the business, at least, was effortless and auspicious, and he was joined in the Sound Techniques recording studio by a few of his personal heroes. The warm, rounded upright bass playing is from Danny Thompson, a founding member of the Pentangle. Richard Thompson plays the pearly guitar leads. Listening to “Time Has Told Me”, the first song on his debut album, is to hear to what might very well be the happiest and most fulfilling moment of Nick Drake’s professional life.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Even as a 20-year-old, Drake's vision for his music was strikingly assured. He was nervous, fumbling, and difficult to engage in conversation in the studio, but he knew what he wanted. He calmly insisted that Boyd and John Wood hire arranger Robert Kirby, a fellow student at Cambridge. Bewildered, they obeyed, and were rewarded with the breathtaking string chart for “Way to Blue”. With its clean lines and grave elegance, ""Way to Blue"" suggests the philosophy that would distinguish Nick Drake’s music over the years and damn it during his lifetime: in Joe Boyd’s words, it simply  “was not reaching out to you."" Drake was painfully English, and showiness wasn’t really in his nature. But profundity glowed from his music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This approach extends to his guitar playing, which was so obsessively perfect it almost escapes comprehension. You will never hear a single string buzz. It's not the sort of virtuosity that quiets a chattering crowd, but once you've attuned to the absolute silence, it quickly grows otherworldly. Even on densely packed fingerpicking runs like ""Day Is Done"", each note sits in the mix like a stone at the floor of a clear pond. He was a frighteningly flawless player, in a way that served to magnify his incorporeality: There is no surviving video of Nick Drake playing live or talking. He died in 1974, but his physicality is as remote to our modern imagination as Gustav Mahler's.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">His concerns were similarly otherworldly and timeless, informed by a childhood of English Romantic poets. The futility of knowing the mind of another was a persistent theme in his lyrics, which looked right past people to stars, trees, eternity. “Who can know the thoughts of Mary Jane?” Drake muses. “Who can know the reason for her smile?” His music viewed human behavior and its peculiarities with quizzical detachment, even when the case study is Drake himself: “So I'll leave the ways that are making me be/ What I really don't want to be,”, he sings on ""Time Has Told Me"". Sizing up the enormity of this task, examining how it might be accomplished—these were not really his philosophical concerns. They overwhelmed him or they simply didn’t interest him, but either way, they came to trip him up, as they do us all.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When it was released in the fall of 1969, <i>Five Leaves Left</i> went unnoticed. Island Records had done it no favors. The packaging was insultingly botched; two songs—""Day Is Done” and “Way To Blue”—were switched in the tracklisting and “Three Hours” was mistakenly titled “Sundown”. But Drake was also complicit; he began his first ill-fated tour behind the faltering album, and between songs, he would tune his guitar for minutes on end to stony, uncomfortable silence. He often walked off dejected before finishing his set. He disappeared into dope smoke, a predilection that was slowly hardening into a crutch. He blew off radio sessions and interviews and slowly began retreating into himself. It was under these circumstances that he ventured back into the studio for <b><i>Bryter Layter</i></b>, his second full-length.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ironically, it was initially conceived as his ""up"" album, a poppy rejoinder to <i>Five Leaves Left</i>. <i>Five Leaves</i> was pastoral, written in the wooded confines of Cambridge. <i>Layter</i> was written in London, and was meant to reflect urbanity. It did, but only from the perspective of Drake's one bloodshot eye, peering out cautiously at the world. Over woolly saxophone on ""At the Chime of a City Clock"", he confesses ""I stay indoors beneath the floors and talk with neighbors only/ The games you play make people say you're either weird or lonely"". Over the peppy horn charts of ""Hazey Jane II"", Drake sings lightly of how it feels ""when the world it gets so crowded that you can't look out the window in the morning."" The city, on <i>Bryter Layter</i>, is one long harsh unpleasant noise occurring outside. Nothing good or stimulating seems to happen there.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The music, however, is brighter—this is the Nick Drake you can hear reflected in latter-period <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"" target=""_blank"">Belle and Sebastian</a>. He rehearsed with a band for the first time, including other members of Fairport Convention, and the result is the most fulsome studio recording he ever managed. Some of the arrangement decisions remain bewildering—the gospel backup vocals, jazz-comping guitar and noodling piano crowding the space on ""Poor Boy"" remain as jarring now as they were when the album was released. On ""Fly"" and ""Northern Sky"", Drake worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/649-john-cale/"" target=""_blank"">John Cale</a>, and you can hear a more natural dynamic in their collaboration. It's either a shame or a relief they didn't work together longer: ""Fly"" and ""Northern Sky""are the two most affecting songs on <i>Bryter</i>, but it's also likely Cale introduced Drake to heroin.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On <b><i>Pink Moon</i></b>, Nick Drake’s final official album, there is one single overdub: the piano part drifting over the title track. The rest is just Drake, his pristine, eerily perfect playing, his mumbling, and silence. <i>Bryter</i> had also sold poorly and received near-zero notices—the most favorable review compared it to ""Classical Gas"". By now, he hardly spoke to anyone; in between takes, John Wood remembers, Drake betrayed neither pleasure or displeasure. He simply sat. Keith Morris, the photographer who shot the album's photography, remarked that working with Drake was ""like working with still life."" The album was recorded in two evenings, by his bewildered crew, who were uncertain of what they were even making. When Drake was finished, he dropped the manila package, almost without a word, at Island Records.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A ""pink moon"" is a baleful symbol, a sign of impending death or calamity. On ""Pink Moon"", it's ""gonna get ye all."" On paper, this sentiment reads like vindictive rage, but on record, it sounds contemplative. Drake's voice never conveyed palpable anger or sadness; he had a slight, gentle voice and upper-class accent, the product of his upbringing, clipped and clean, and his guitar, as always, rang out with a crystalline purity. His music is so consoling that the darkness at its heart is not always accessible. It's almost impossible to hear the emotional abandon in <i>Pink Moon</i>, then, without the taste of his first two albums lingering on your mouth. It's only then that the bone-dry resonance of the guitars registers as slightly alarming, and the backdrop of silence suggests both the purity of Drake's vision and also something darker: like someone who has dropped out of the world, mumbling prophecies.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On ""Place to Be"", he remembers his youth only as a time he ""didn't see the truth hanging from the door""; now, he is ""weaker than the palest blue."" ""Know"" consists of just four lines—""You know that I love you/ You know I don't care/ You know that I see you/ You know I'm not there."" It sounds like a back-and-forth between Drake and the world at large. There is a stillness to Nick Drake's music that bewitches anyone who gets near enough, and <i>Pink Moon</i> is its purest expression. It remains the Nick Drake record most people begin with, and for good reason.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The eleven songs on <i>Pink Moon</i> were not Nick Drake's final recordings, however. In the last year of his life, he would return to the studio, his fingernails long, his hair dirty, his clothes in shambles, to cut beginning tracks for what would have been his fourth album. They went poorly. Joe Boyd recalls that Drake, the flawless technician, was no longer able to play and sing at the same time, so the sessions limped agonizingly while he fumbled through guitar takes and then returned to sing, shakily. These four songs—""Black Eyed Dog"", ""Rider on the Wheel"", ""Tow the Line"", and ""Hanging on a Star""—are the only truly discomfiting records he ever made. On ""Black Eyed Dog"", he sang tremulously over some hammered harmonics about growing old and wanting to go home. Within four months, he was dead.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The most consequential material on <b><i>Made to Love Magic</i> </b>remain these final tracks. The sundry unreleased tracks, such as the hallucinatory “Clothes of Sand” and the odd, jaunty “Mayfair"", are interesting but inessential. The rest of the album is the usual posthumous footnotes tumble: A version of ""River Man"" recorded when Drake was still at college; a scrapped version of ""Three Days"" from the tentative early sessions of <i>Five Leaves Left</i>; an early alternate take of ""Thoughts of Mary Jane"", with distracted, noodly lead guitar playing from Richard Thompson. There are a handful of performances from Drake's first-ever public concert, the so-called ""work tape"" from his college days. They don't do much to enrich the Nick Drake story.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><b><i>Family Tree</i></b>, though, is odder and more interesting. The album, which was only released in 2007, compiles all the known existing home recordings of Nick Drake—music he recorded at his parents' house for fun or to kill time; rehearsals of Mozart trios with his aunt and uncle (he played clarinet). The 28 tracks consist largely of covers and traditionals, including a run through ""All My Trials"", sung with his sister Gabrielle.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Family Tree</i> doesn’t give the world any classic lost Nick Drake music, but it does give the sensation, achieved with a little effort, of what it might have been like to sit in the Drakes' parlor in Far Leys. You can hear the actual clink of actual tea cups in the background of his cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Dylan</a>'s ""Tomorrow Is a Long Time"". You get to hear Nick Drake messing about on guitar, which sounds better than anyone else's.

It sounds like a back-and-forth between Drake and the world at large. There is a stillness to Nick Drake's music that bewitches anyone who gets near enough, and <i>Pink Moon</i> is its purest expression. It remains the Nick Drake record most people begin with, and for good reason.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The eleven songs on <i>Pink Moon</i> were not Nick Drake's final recordings, however. In the last year of his life, he would return to the studio, his fingernails long, his hair dirty, his clothes in shambles, to cut beginning tracks for what would have been his fourth album. They went poorly. Joe Boyd recalls that Drake, the flawless technician, was no longer able to play and sing at the same time, so the sessions limped agonizingly while he fumbled through guitar takes and then returned to sing, shakily. These four songs—""Black Eyed Dog"", ""Rider on the Wheel"", ""Tow the Line"", and ""Hanging on a Star""—are the only truly discomfiting records he ever made. On ""Black Eyed Dog"", he sang tremulously over some hammered harmonics about growing old and wanting to go home. Within four months, he was dead.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The most consequential material on <b><i>Made to Love Magic</i> </b>remain these final tracks. The sundry unreleased tracks, such as the hallucinatory “Clothes of Sand” and the odd, jaunty “Mayfair"", are interesting but inessential. The rest of the album is the usual posthumous footnotes tumble: A version of ""River Man"" recorded when Drake was still at college; a scrapped version of ""Three Days"" from the tentative early sessions of <i>Five Leaves Left</i>; an early alternate take of ""Thoughts of Mary Jane"", with distracted, noodly lead guitar playing from Richard Thompson. There are a handful of performances from Drake's first-ever public concert, the so-called ""work tape"" from his college days. They don't do much to enrich the Nick Drake story.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><b><i>Family Tree</i></b>, though, is odder and more interesting. The album, which was only released in 2007, compiles all the known existing home recordings of Nick Drake—music he recorded at his parents' house for fun or to kill time; rehearsals of Mozart trios with his aunt and uncle (he played clarinet). The 28 tracks consist largely of covers and traditionals, including a run through ""All My Trials"", sung with his sister Gabrielle.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Family Tree</i> doesn’t give the world any classic lost Nick Drake music, but it does give the sensation, achieved with a little effort, of what it might have been like to sit in the Drakes' parlor in Far Leys. You can hear the actual clink of actual tea cups in the background of his cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Dylan</a>'s ""Tomorrow Is a Long Time"". You get to hear Nick Drake messing about on guitar, which sounds better than anyone else's. His version of ""Cocaine Blues"" is enjoyable  both because it's a looser and bluesier Nick Drake than we're used to, and also because of his pronunciation of ""cocaine,"" which suggests a side of finger sandwiches.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Family Tree</i> also includes two of his mother's haunting, intriguingly wayward songs. ""Poor Mum"" makes for an odd companion with her son's ""Poor Boy""; ""Joy as it flies cannot be caught"", she sings, searchingly, her voice climbing into a breath-catching question mark. There is an unmistakable hint of the fatalism that trailed her son's music in these recordings, and in ""Do You Ever Remember"", she sings lines that could lead directly into ""Time Has Told Me"": ""Time was ever a vagabond/ Time was always a thief/ Time can steal away happiness/ But time can take away grief.""</p>
<p>This was Nick Drake's existential dilemma: He would rather ponder time than observe the present, would sooner gaze into the sea than engage with the people around him. School friends recall conversations about spirits and ""the little people"" as the only times they saw him animated. The rage he directed at his producer Joe Boyd for his failed career on ""Hanging on a Star"" (""Why leave me hanging on a star/ When you deem me so high""?) was in part the sound of someone realizing that their worldly woes have slowly blotted out their view of the stars, perhaps forever. ""I could have been a signpost, could've been a clock,"" he mused on ""One of These Things First""; this is the sentiment of someone who barely assented to the burdens of being a person. For such a soul, there can never be such a thing as a career. There can only be a legacy.</p></div>"|18793.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18793-nick-drake-tuck-box/|10.0|Jayson Greene

The most rebellious act of his youth was a note politely informing his tutor he was leaving school. His musical career was a disaster, but not a funny or entertaining one—his albums were simply ignored and audiences talked obliviously through his live gigs. He moved back home, fell into a deep depression, and one night, either by accident or on purpose, took too many pills. When he died, there was almost nothing to feel good about.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This has proved a difficult predicament for the record labels charged with profiting off his legacy. The posthumous marketing of Nick Drake's music has been arduous and fitful, a decades-long attempt at setting right what everyone agreed went horribly wrong the first time. First there was 1979's overpriced <i>Fruit Tree</i> box, which bombed. Then came the slightly more successful 1985 best-of <i>Heaven in a Wild Flower</i> and 1986’s <i>Time of No Reply</i>,  a collection of rare and officially unreleased tracks. His cult profile rose modestly through the 90s, but it wasn’t until 2000, when “Pink Moon” famously found its way into <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIOW9fLT9eY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Cabrio commercial</a>, that Nick Drake's fortune as a ""penniless genius"" finally received its uplifting footnote. Since then, there has been a flurry of release activity, all of it packaging the same tiny body of work spanning six years. Nick Drake is finally famous, but it took the record industry 40 years to figure out how to make it happen.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's worth revisiting this dubious history while considering<i> Tuck Box, </i>the latest and possibly final repackaging. Alongside his three studio albums—<i>Five Leaves Left</i>, <i>Bryter Layter</i>, and <i>Pink Moon—</i>this boxed set includes the 2004 compilation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2445-made-to-love-magic/"" target=""_blank""><i>Made to Love Magic</i></a>, (itself a barely altered repackaging of <i>Time of No Reply</i>) as well as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10391-family-tree/"" target=""_blank""><i>Family Tree</i>,</a> a 2007 collection of Nick Drake's home recordings with a few short, haunting songs by his mother, the folk singer and poet Molly. There is not a single second of new or unreleased music waiting for you inside this handsomely designed object, in other words; the packaging, which replicates the wooden box that Nick Drake’s mother used to send him cakes in while he was at Marlborough College, is the sole original flourish.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What <i>Tuck Box</i> offers, then, is simply another chance to revisit Nick Drake's short, sad story. Because Drake died in desolation and obscurity, and because his music grows more influential every year, there will never quite be a <i>bad</i> moment to rediscover him. His three studio albums have settled into cultural totems, albums that anyone hoping to know something about rock history buys sooner or later. Even 40-odd years later, their thumbprint remains unique, a strange and compelling mix of timeless poetic melancholy on the one hand, and cloistered, pampered schoolboy modernity on the other. They sit completely to the left of all rock music, which Drake could care less about; his version of a garage band was a group of boys at his boarding school, one of whom was the grand-nephew of John Maynard Keynes. (Their name was the Perfumed Gardeners.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Drake was influenced instead by British folk royalty like John Martyn and Bert Jansch, or Ashley Hutchings of the Fairport Convention. When he recorded his debut, 1969’s <b><i>Five Leaves Left</i></b>, he must have felt, at least momentarily, that he was joining their ranks. It was Hutchings who had enthusiastically approached Drake in local pub The Roundhouse, offering to pass his information along to the legendary manager Joe Boyd. Drake's entrance into the business, at least, was effortless and auspicious, and he was joined in the Sound Techniques recording studio by a few of his personal heroes. The warm, rounded upright bass playing is from Danny Thompson, a founding member of the Pentangle. Richard Thompson plays the pearly guitar leads. Listening to “Time Has Told Me”, the first song on his debut album, is to hear to what might very well be the happiest and most fulfilling moment of Nick Drake’s professional life.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Even as a 20-year-old, Drake's vision for his music was strikingly assured. He was nervous, fumbling, and difficult to engage in conversation in the studio, but he knew what he wanted. He calmly insisted that Boyd and John Wood hire arranger Robert Kirby, a fellow student at Cambridge. Bewildered, they obeyed, and were rewarded with the breathtaking string chart for “Way to Blue”. With its clean lines and grave elegance, ""Way to Blue"" suggests the philosophy that would distinguish Nick Drake’s music over the years and damn it during his lifetime: in Joe Boyd’s words, it simply  “was not reaching out to you."" Drake was painfully English, and showiness wasn’t really in his nature. But profundity glowed from his music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This approach extends to his guitar playing, which was so obsessively perfect it almost escapes comprehension. You will never hear a single string buzz. It's not the sort of virtuosity that quiets a chattering crowd, but once you've attuned to the absolute silence, it quickly grows otherworldly. Even on densely packed fingerpicking runs like ""Day Is Done"", each note sits in the mix like a stone at the floor of a clear pond. He was a frighteningly flawless player, in a way that served to magnify his incorporeality: There is no surviving video of Nick Drake playing live or talking. He died in 1974, but his physicality is as remote to our modern imagination as Gustav Mahler's.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">His concerns were similarly otherworldly and timeless, informed by a childhood of English Romantic poets. The futility of knowing the mind of another was a persistent theme in his lyrics, which looked right past people to stars, trees, eternity. “Who can know the thoughts of Mary Jane?” Drake muses. “Who can know the reason for her smile?” His music viewed human behavior and its peculiarities with quizzical detachment, even when the case study is Drake himself: “So I'll leave the ways that are making me be/ What I really don't want to be,”, he sings on ""Time Has Told Me"". Sizing up the enormity of this task, examining how it might be accomplished—these were not really his philosophical concerns. They overwhelmed him or they simply didn’t interest him, but either way, they came to trip him up, as they do us all.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When it was released in the fall of 1969, <i>Five Leaves Left</i> went unnoticed. Island Records had done it no favors. The packaging was insultingly botched; two songs—""Day Is Done” and “Way To Blue”—were switched in the tracklisting and “Three Hours” was mistakenly titled “Sundown”. But Drake was also complicit; he began his first ill-fated tour behind the faltering album, and between songs, he would tune his guitar for minutes on end to stony, uncomfortable silence. He often walked off dejected before finishing his set. He disappeared into dope smoke, a predilection that was slowly hardening into a crutch. He blew off radio sessions and interviews and slowly began retreating into himself. It was under these circumstances that he ventured back into the studio for <b><i>Bryter Layter</i></b>, his second full-length.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Ironically, it was initially conceived as his ""up"" album, a poppy rejoinder to <i>Five Leaves Left</i>. <i>Five Leaves</i> was pastoral, written in the wooded confines of Cambridge. <i>Layter</i> was written in London, and was meant to reflect urbanity. It did, but only from the perspective of Drake's one bloodshot eye, peering out cautiously at the world. Over woolly saxophone on ""At the Chime of a City Clock"", he confesses ""I stay indoors beneath the floors and talk with neighbors only/ The games you play make people say you're either weird or lonely"". Over the peppy horn charts of ""Hazey Jane II"", Drake sings lightly of how it feels ""when the world it gets so crowded that you can't look out the window in the morning."" The city, on <i>Bryter Layter</i>, is one long harsh unpleasant noise occurring outside. Nothing good or stimulating seems to happen there.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The music, however, is brighter—this is the Nick Drake you can hear reflected in latter-period <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"" target=""_blank"">Belle and Sebastian</a>. He rehearsed with a band for the first time, including other members of Fairport Convention, and the result is the most fulsome studio recording he ever managed. Some of the arrangement decisions remain bewildering—the gospel backup vocals, jazz-comping guitar and noodling piano crowding the space on ""Poor Boy"" remain as jarring now as they were when the album was released. On ""Fly"" and ""Northern Sky"", Drake worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/649-john-cale/"" target=""_blank"">John Cale</a>, and you can hear a more natural dynamic in their collaboration. It's either a shame or a relief they didn't work together longer: ""Fly"" and ""Northern Sky""are the two most affecting songs on <i>Bryter</i>, but it's also likely Cale introduced Drake to heroin.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On <b><i>Pink Moon</i></b>, Nick Drake’s final official album, there is one single overdub: the piano part drifting over the title track. The rest is just Drake, his pristine, eerily perfect playing, his mumbling, and silence. <i>Bryter</i> had also sold poorly and received near-zero notices—the most favorable review compared it to ""Classical Gas"". By now, he hardly spoke to anyone; in between takes, John Wood remembers, Drake betrayed neither pleasure or displeasure. He simply sat. Keith Morris, the photographer who shot the album's photography, remarked that working with Drake was ""like working with still life."" The album was recorded in two evenings, by his bewildered crew, who were uncertain of what they were even making. When Drake was finished, he dropped the manila package, almost without a word, at Island Records.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A ""pink moon"" is a baleful symbol, a sign of impending death or calamity. On ""Pink Moon"", it's ""gonna get ye all."" On paper, this sentiment reads like vindictive rage, but on record, it sounds contemplative. Drake's voice never conveyed palpable anger or sadness; he had a slight, gentle voice and upper-class accent, the product of his upbringing, clipped and clean, and his guitar, as always, rang out with a crystalline purity. His music is so consoling that the darkness at its heart is not always accessible. It's almost impossible to hear the emotional abandon in <i>Pink Moon</i>, then, without the taste of his first two albums lingering on your mouth. It's only then that the bone-dry resonance of the guitars registers as slightly alarming, and the backdrop of silence suggests both the purity of Drake's vision and also something darker: like someone who has dropped out of the world, mumbling prophecies.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On ""Place to Be"", he remembers his youth only as a time he ""didn't see the truth hanging from the door""; now, he is ""weaker than the palest blue."" ""Know"" consists of just four lines—""You know that I love you/ You know I don't care/ You know that I see you/ You know I'm not there."" It sounds like a back-and-forth between Drake and the world at large. There is a stillness to Nick Drake's music that bewitches anyone who gets near enough, and <i>Pink Moon</i> is its purest expression. It remains the Nick Drake record most people begin with, and for good reason.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The eleven songs on <i>Pink Moon</i> were not Nick Drake's final recordings, however. In the last year of his life, he would return to the studio, his fingernails long, his hair dirty, his clothes in shambles, to cut beginning tracks for what would have been his fourth album.

The album was recorded in two evenings, by his bewildered crew, who were uncertain of what they were even making. When Drake was finished, he dropped the manila package, almost without a word, at Island Records.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A ""pink moon"" is a baleful symbol, a sign of impending death or calamity. On ""Pink Moon"", it's ""gonna get ye all."" On paper, this sentiment reads like vindictive rage, but on record, it sounds contemplative. Drake's voice never conveyed palpable anger or sadness; he had a slight, gentle voice and upper-class accent, the product of his upbringing, clipped and clean, and his guitar, as always, rang out with a crystalline purity. His music is so consoling that the darkness at its heart is not always accessible. It's almost impossible to hear the emotional abandon in <i>Pink Moon</i>, then, without the taste of his first two albums lingering on your mouth. It's only then that the bone-dry resonance of the guitars registers as slightly alarming, and the backdrop of silence suggests both the purity of Drake's vision and also something darker: like someone who has dropped out of the world, mumbling prophecies.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On ""Place to Be"", he remembers his youth only as a time he ""didn't see the truth hanging from the door""; now, he is ""weaker than the palest blue."" ""Know"" consists of just four lines—""You know that I love you/ You know I don't care/ You know that I see you/ You know I'm not there."" It sounds like a back-and-forth between Drake and the world at large. There is a stillness to Nick Drake's music that bewitches anyone who gets near enough, and <i>Pink Moon</i> is its purest expression. It remains the Nick Drake record most people begin with, and for good reason.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The eleven songs on <i>Pink Moon</i> were not Nick Drake's final recordings, however. In the last year of his life, he would return to the studio, his fingernails long, his hair dirty, his clothes in shambles, to cut beginning tracks for what would have been his fourth album. They went poorly. Joe Boyd recalls that Drake, the flawless technician, was no longer able to play and sing at the same time, so the sessions limped agonizingly while he fumbled through guitar takes and then returned to sing, shakily. These four songs—""Black Eyed Dog"", ""Rider on the Wheel"", ""Tow the Line"", and ""Hanging on a Star""—are the only truly discomfiting records he ever made. On ""Black Eyed Dog"", he sang tremulously over some hammered harmonics about growing old and wanting to go home. Within four months, he was dead.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The most consequential material on <b><i>Made to Love Magic</i> </b>remain these final tracks. The sundry unreleased tracks, such as the hallucinatory “Clothes of Sand” and the odd, jaunty “Mayfair"", are interesting but inessential. The rest of the album is the usual posthumous footnotes tumble: A version of ""River Man"" recorded when Drake was still at college; a scrapped version of ""Three Days"" from the tentative early sessions of <i>Five Leaves Left</i>; an early alternate take of ""Thoughts of Mary Jane"", with distracted, noodly lead guitar playing from Richard Thompson. There are a handful of performances from Drake's first-ever public concert, the so-called ""work tape"" from his college days. They don't do much to enrich the Nick Drake story.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><b><i>Family Tree</i></b>, though, is odder and more interesting. The album, which was only released in 2007, compiles all the known existing home recordings of Nick Drake—music he recorded at his parents' house for fun or to kill time; rehearsals of Mozart trios with his aunt and uncle (he played clarinet). The 28 tracks consist largely of covers and traditionals, including a run through ""All My Trials"", sung with his sister Gabrielle.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Family Tree</i> doesn’t give the world any classic lost Nick Drake music, but it does give the sensation, achieved with a little effort, of what it might have been like to sit in the Drakes' parlor in Far Leys. You can hear the actual clink of actual tea cups in the background of his cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Dylan</a>'s ""Tomorrow Is a Long Time"". You get to hear Nick Drake messing about on guitar, which sounds better than anyone else's. His version of ""Cocaine Blues"" is enjoyable  both because it's a looser and bluesier Nick Drake than we're used to, and also because of his pronunciation of ""cocaine,"" which suggests a side of finger sandwiches.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Family Tree</i> also includes two of his mother's haunting, intriguingly wayward songs. ""Poor Mum"" makes for an odd companion with her son's ""Poor Boy""; ""Joy as it flies cannot be caught"", she sings, searchingly, her voice climbing into a breath-catching question mark. There is an unmistakable hint of the fatalism that trailed her son's music in these recordings, and in ""Do You Ever Remember"", she sings lines that could lead directly into ""Time Has Told Me"": ""Time was ever a vagabond/ Time was always a thief/ Time can steal away happiness/ But time can take away grief.""</p>
<p>This was Nick Drake's existential dilemma: He would rather ponder time than observe the present, would sooner gaze into the sea than engage with the people around him. School friends recall conversations about spirits and ""the little people"" as the only times they saw him animated. The rage he directed at his producer Joe Boyd for his failed career on ""Hanging on a Star"" (""Why leave me hanging on a star/ When you deem me so high""?) was in part the sound of someone realizing that their worldly woes have slowly blotted out their view of the stars, perhaps forever. ""I could have been a signpost, could've been a clock,"" he mused on ""One of These Things First""; this is the sentiment of someone who barely assented to the burdens of being a person. For such a soul, there can never be such a thing as a career. There can only be a legacy.</p></div>"|18793.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18793-nick-drake-tuck-box/|6.7|Jayson Greene

The enigmatic L.A. artist has recorded under a lot of names, like Muzz, Fictional Boys, and John Webster Johns. He <a href=""http://www.lamag.com/laculture/culturefilesblog/2014/01/16/6-facts-about-jack-name-las-enigmatic-purveyor-of-fictional-rock-n-roll"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">says</a> that's because he's ""sort of anti-identity."" ""I like the idea of destroying identity... We’re all the same underneath it all anyway."" His moniker, then, feels appropriate—""Jack Name"" somehow manages to sound even more anonymous than ""John Smith."" Throughout his album <i>Light Show</i>, his voice shifts pitch and timbre. Sometimes it's high and squeaky, sometimes he goes deep, and sometimes it's completely unintelligible and unrecognizably warped. It's as though he's intentionally making it difficult to pin down one easily definable character behind the music.</p>
<p>Perhaps his elusive nature is there to place stronger emphasis on <i>Light Show</i>'s narrative.<i> </i>The album's world is so fully formed and linear, it seems preferable to refer to it is a ""rock opera"" instead of a ""concept album."" Name has said the record is inspired by his aversion to ""the way kids are put on drugs for educational purposes."" It's easy to hear this theme in his symbolism-addled lyrics. Throughout <i>Light Show</i>, there's an implication that one must conform to societal norms, though at the expense of ""diluted feelings."" The central character, however, learns to embrace his ""shadow""—the thing that makes him love dreaming in color and rock'n'roll. These themes are all presented in a world featuring characters that are cartoonishly similar to those from <i>Tommy</i>, <i>The Point</i>, and <i>Yellow Submarine</i>. But <i>Light</i> <i>Show</i>'s overall arc follows a sort of <i>Brave New World</i> logic—sometimes it's better to be an individual than to medicate and become a neutral-minded pod person. ""I’ve always questioned the whole idea of ‘chemical imbalance,’ because I don’t think there’s anything wrong with those kids,"" Name said. ""There’s something wrong with the world."" </p>
<p>It's an ambitious idea, to write an album-length parable about how attention-deficit medications, antidepressants, and other pharmaceuticals are capable of crushing someone's creative spirit. It's a potentially resonant topic, too, as artists have shared stories about antidepressants' <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/may/19/does-prozac-help-artists-be-creative"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">negative (and positive) effects</a> on their artistic drive. And although Name follows this theme with some consistently intriguing and at times abstract poetry, it's the music accompanying his words that makes <i>Light Show</i> a compelling listen. There's a kinetic rock'n'roll drive to ""Do the Shadow"" and cheeseball melodrama in the soaring riffs of ""New Guitars"". When he eases up on the ""guitar rock"" elements of the record, there are moments where he pairs glowing synths with mutant voices for a haunting effect. And since it's not a high flyer like ""New Guitars"" or anthemic like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16315-jack-name-pure-terror/"">""Pure Terror""</a>, the buzzing drone of ""Puffy Cheek Town"" keeps the album's soundscape diverse.</p>
<p>""The shadow"" is a pervasive theme in the album—a ctrl-F search of the lyrics sheet brings up 29 matches across six of the album's songs. In this context, especially in the songs where he references dreams, it's tempting to consider the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(psychology)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jungian definition of ""shadow""</a>—the unconscious elements of one's personality. On ""Do the Shadow"", the narrator realizes he was ""born a rocker"" and embraces his alter ego. ""Trans-America"", a somber track, features two characters (both voiced by Name) who sing about a hollow, sort of anonymous existence that comes with ""painting all my shadows white."" It ends with a simple line about conformity and how it can stifle emotions: ""You care what they say about me.""</p>
<p>This long narrative about status quo, the shadow self, and so on culminates in ""Killing a Shadow"", which (spoiler) is an unsettlingly quiet track where the main character has his coveted shadow sucked out of his body and replaced with light. It's an ending that serves Name's ""there's something wrong with the world"" outlook. But it ends the album with a trudging pace. This downbeat final note, along with the album's chaotic array of voices, require for the listener to be fully invested in the record's narrative. Even though it's got some catchy, immediate songs (""Pure Terror"", ""Do the Shadow""), this isn't incidental music. It's an album that asks for focus and thought. It's the sort of thing where you could spend a substantial amount of time teasing out the symbolism behind these songs. Name might not care if you know who he is or what he calls himself, but he's put a lot of effort into his dystopia. You should consider spending some time there.</p></div>"|18900.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18900-jack-name-light-show/|7.0|Evan Minsker

In 1984, punk had more need of God’s help. By then the British punk movement had been bashing its head against the establishment for eight years straight. Outside of the cartoonish, spiky-haired nihilist Vyvyan on BBC’s ""</span>The Young Ones<i>"", </i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">punk had little to show for it. The chart-storming gains made by the Pistols and the Clash had given way to marginalization and self-caricature. The Exploited’s 1981 anthem “Punks Not Dead” was already a hollow echo. Punk’s founders had moved on to noise, dub, metal, pop. The most visible face of post-punk was not Rotten, nor even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23514-public-image-ltd/"" target=""_blank"">Public Image Ltd.</a>’s John Lydon, but a flower-waving crooner named <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"" target=""_blank"">Morrissey</a>. The year George Orwell had so ominously predicted had finally arrived. But instead of being the vanguard of the resistance against Big Brother, punk was something peddled to King’s Road tourists on the backs of postcards.</span></p>
<p>In the midst of that, Vex’s sole release, <i>Sanctuary</i>, came out. A four-song 12” issued by Fight Back, an imprint of Conflict’s label Mortarhate, <i>Sanctuary</i> was a part of the collective document of a U.K. anarcho-punk underground that had managed to not only survive, but flourish well into the 80s. Conflict, along with the similarly political Crass, was a leader of the scene; Vex was a minor participant, a footnote to a footnote. The band was also short-lived, which was the order of the day. Crass had previously vowed to break up if it ever lasted long enough to see 1984, although it reneged on that promise, later naming their anthology <i>Best Before 1984</i> in reference to it. “No future” had come to roost. Accordingly, anarcho-punk bands sounded far more dark, desperate, raw, and apocalyptic than anything at the time (at least this side of a new music springing up in Europe that would come to be called black metal).</p>
<p>Vex had desperation to burn. And on <i>Sanctuary</i>, burn it does. Throbbing with ominous, semi-industrial precision, the song slams along to a martial beat and splintery guitars, a dance track for the gleefully damned. Like a tribe of cyborgs, the band turns anger into something almost mystically ritualistic. It’s an approach Killing Joke had already solidly established by then, and the Killing Joke influence on “Sanctuary” is pronounced—as it is on “It’s No Crime"", whose tense, slashing riffs bears a marked similarity to “The Wait”, one of Killing Joke’s most famous songs. Lead singer Scrote also borrows liberally from Jaz Coleman’s robo-goth howl. But where Killing Joke cloaked its anger in code, Vex was more direct. But not by much. The anarcho-punk approach left little room for poetic half-measures, and “World in Action” spews wrathful outrage even as Scrote chants, in an escalating spasm of stereo-panned paranoia, “There is a theory that this has already happened / There is a theory that this has already happened.” “Relative Sadness” sinks deeper into the ethereal, a clanking skeleton of a song that borders on the early deathrock of Theatre of Hate.</p>
<p>Perhaps realizing that a more oblique attack might be better than a frontal assault, anarcho-punk as a whole was beginning to adopt a broader sound at the time. By 1986, one of Vex’s closest contemporaries, the far better known Flux of Pink Indians, would shorten its name to Flux and put out its daring, dubby, Adrian Sherwood-produced album <i>Uncarved Block.</i> <i>Sanctuary</i> doesn’t go that far. Vex’s final release, though, shows how much potential the band had. Sacred Bones’ new reissue of Sanctuary includes the bonus track “Rushing to Hide”, a song from Fight Back’s 1985 compilation <i>We Don’t Want Your Fucking Law!</i> that combines Scrote’s knack for panicked anthems with dense percussion and steely sheets of atonal guitar.</p>
<p>The reissue’s remaining three bonus tracks—“It’s No Crime”, “Pain”, and “Pressure”—hail from Vex’s 1983 cassette demo. Flat, lo-fi, and corrosive, they’re prickly sketches of a group-in-progress still beholden to Killing Joke. When the refrain “The pain!/ The pain!” pops up in “Pain”, it’s another open nod to “The Wait"". Given time, Vex may have grown beyond that hero worship and become an influential force all its own. Not that the record isn’t relevant. The shivering, savage, post-punk howl of <i>Sanctuary</i> can be heard in lots of current bands, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29540-iceage/"" target=""_blank"">Iceage</a> to Arctic Flowers, although it’s a safe bet that Vex hasn’t directly inspired any of them. But the sound itself echoes. Punk, in England and elsewhere, weathered the confusion and disillusionment of the 80s. It’s as vital now as it ever was. Vex may never have envisioned a future for itself, but the spastic, atmospheric passion of <i>Sanctuary </i>has taken care of that for them.</p></div>"|18897.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18897-vex-sanctuary-the-complete-discography/|7.4|Jason Heller

Take, for instance, Kansas City trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31920-shy-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Shy Boys</a>. Brothers Collin and Kyle Rausch and roommate Konnor Ervin formed the band before they'd ever picked up their instruments, and from the ramshackle sound of their self-titled debut, they haven't lost much sleep staying up late to work on their scales. Unabashed amateurishness can cut both ways; certain groups cut through the rough patches with enough youthful exuberance or ingrained pop sensibility, but for others, the incompetency's more than the songs can bear. Instrumentally, <i>Shy Boys</i> is far from dazzling: tentative one minute, roughshod the next. But these limitations don't seem to be holding Shy Boys' songcraft back. From these rickety arrangements, they've carved out the kind of sly, spiny, instinctive hooks any seasoned band would be lucky to stumble upon.<br/><br/>The Shy Boys have dubbed their jangly indie-pop ""landlocked surf music,"" which, as self-styled descriptors go, isn't half-bad. Rumbling staccato riffs and candied Beach Boys harmonies form the foundation of many of these songs, and there's a late-afternoon haze hanging over even the least sunstroked numbers. There's no shortage of turn-of-the-60s pop in the DNA of these songs, from doo-wop to teen-heartthrob crooner-types; the syrupy, slightly unsettling ""Heart is Mine"" is Frankie Avalon by way of the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28000-the-smith-westerns/"" target=""_blank"">Smith Westerns</a> LP, while the late-LP twofer ""Fireworks"" and ""Trim"" are one spiked punchbowl away from closing out a Sadie Hawkins dance. But, while certain touchstones echo throughout these songs, their unschooled approach to songcraft mostly keeps mere imitation at bay. Shy Boys is a short album—ten songs in barely 24 minutes—and songs don't waste a lot of time getting to the point. Hooks are shoved front-and-center, pesky things like bridges fall by the wayside, and instrumental flourishes are few and far between. It's a risk, but it pays off; by eliminating the distance between you and these homespun hooks, they burrow their way into your head that much quicker.<br/><br/>Though singer/guitarist Collin Rausch's lyrics all-too-often get swept up in a sea of reverb, he's in sweet, tender voice throughout Shy Boys, singing with a delicacy that carries his message through the thick coating of Vaseline. The swirling, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3768-the-shins/"" target=""_blank"">Shins</a>-gone-surf ""Bully Fight""—inspired by YouTube-infamous meanie Richard Gale—finds Rausch throwing his charmingly thin voice around like a guy with some experience with getting picked on, while the jittery ""And I Am Nervous"" pretty much reviews itself. That nervous energy's a big reason for Shy Boys' success; getting through these songs in one piece lends these songs an urgency that leaves slowpoke ballad ""Submarine"" feeling woozy, waterlogged. From a structural standpoint, these songs never seem more than a couple bum notes from falling apart. But, between that verge-of-collapse sound and unforced, plucked-from-the-air hooks, <i>Shy Boys</i> operates with a kind of spluttering grace. These unforced, unfussy, unshakably catchy songs are awfully easy to like, and their precarious presentation's just gauzy and peculiar enough to hold together after the dozenth listen.<br/><br/>In a few short years, Ervin and the Rausches haven't just learned how to put a couple chords together; they've figured out how to build songs around their encumbrances, giving their tottering hooks proper space and all but dispensing with the rest. Proficiency's nice, but it isn't everything, and plenty of veteran bands go to great lengths to unlearn enough to write a song as sharp and spontaneous as the swift, stuttering ""Postcard"". Shy Boys still have a few things to figure out, but for now, what they don't know isn't hurting them any.</p></div>"|18917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18917-shy-boys-shy-boys/|7.1|Paul Thompson

(As per band tradition, they let their feelings be known via a </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52403-godspeed-you-black-emperor-respond-to-polaris-prize-win-fucking-insane/"" target=""_blank"">collectively written communiqué</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">.) However, offshoot band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3788-thee-silver-mt-zion-memorial-orchestra-tra-la-la-b/"" target=""_blank"">Thee Silver Mt. Z</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3788-thee-silver-mt-zion-memorial-orchestra-tra-la-la-b/"" target=""_blank"">ion</a>—featuring Godspeed guitarist Efrim Menuck, violinist Sophie Trudeau, and bassist Thierry Amar, along with violinist Jessica Moss and drummer David Payant—has been more amenable to countering all that “no” with the odd “yes.” Though they share with Godspeed a deep suspicion of authority and institutions, and the faintest of hopes that sanity will prevail in a world gone mad, they’ve come to broadcast their ideas through more clearly communicated means: interviews, </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2juuBNQre8U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lengthy onstage addresses</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, lyrics we can all join in on, and songs that are both more outwardly anthemic and viscerally rocking than Godspeed’s slow-surging, side-long epics.</span></p>
<p>But while Menuck has become a more confident and charismatic vocalist over the years, his lyrics are often rendered in broad-strokes, addressing faceless bogeymen (a Dylanesque procession of bankers, hangmen, and the like) and macro societal maladies, while rooting their more sanguine songs in communal, universal affirmations. So the great strides made on the band’s seventh album, <i>Fuck Off Get Free We Pour the Light on Everything</i>, aren’t so much musical—it’s a logical extension of 2010’s <i>Kollaps Tradixionales</i>—but philosophical: This time, it’s personal. The album is less concerned with asserting a specific worldview than examining the difficulties of keeping one’s moral compass steady in a society that’s becoming ever-more indifferent to the things you value—and how one must remain all the more resolute once kids enter the picture. </p>
<p>Menuck and Moss became parents in recent years; that’s their boy Ezra we hear in the new album’s opening seconds, delivering the band’s simple mission statement: “We live on the island called Montreal, and we make a lot of noise… because we love each other!” The experience of new fatherhood factored into some of the songs on Menuck’s scaled-down 2011 solo release, <i>Plays High Gospel</i>, but that intimate perspective is retained here amid Thee Silver Mt. Zion’s orchestro-punk onslaught, with the band’s usual big-picture concerns intensified by the lingering question of what kind of world their children will inherit.</p>
<p>True to the band’s “Memorial Orchestra” and “Tra-La-La Band” suffixes, Thee Silver Mt. Zion albums have always contrasted eulogy with euphoria, but on <i>Fuck Off Get Free</i> the feelings of joy and terror are one and the same. Rather than use violins to embellish their guitar riffs, the album’s monstrous opening track (which, like <i>Kollaps</i>’ “I Built Myself a Metal Bird” is the rare TSMZ song to just charge out of the gates without an extended build-up) fuses the two into the same dissonant frequency. But amid this sound of confusion, Menuck leads the band in a group chant that’s almost nursery-rhyme-like in its simplicity; that album title may seem like a mouthful to read, but it’s surprisingly easy to sing. <i>Fuck Off Get Free</i>’s most exhilarating song is likewise a maelstrom of conflicted emotions: over the course of its 14 minutes, “Austerity Blues” channels screeching cacophony into rousing catharsis, however, Menuck’s triumphant refrain—“Lord, let my son/ Live long enough/ To see that mountain torn down”—is undercut by the implication that the singer won’t be around to see the better world he’s fighting for. And that latent anxiety comes boiling to surface on the raging “Take Away These Early Grave Blues”, which refines the heavy-metal klemzer heard on Godspeed’s 2012 colossus “Mladic” into a more concentrated burst; Menuck coyly acknowledges this otherwise despairing song’s shout-along accessibility when he fashions a hook—“let them sing our/ pretty songs”—that recalls the similarly sarcastic chorus of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a>’s “In Bloom”.</p>
<p>But even the album’s actual pretty songs are suffused with grave prophecies: The deceptively gentle “Little Ones Run”—a piano ballad sung by Trudeau and Moss—presents a bedside lullaby that parents can sing to calm down babies during the next extreme-weather eco-disaster (“Wake up darling the moon is gone/ The sky’s a mess and falling down”). Meanwhile, the album’s emotional centerpiece, “What We Loved Was Not Enough”, is a comment on modern-age ennui that could conceivably waltz its way onto the back half of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"" target=""_blank"">Arcade Fire</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18667-arcade-fire-reflektor/"" target=""_blank""><i>Reflektor</i></a> (if that album was a little less disco and a little more <a href=""http://www.dischord.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dischord</a>), however, for Thee Silver Mt. Zion, the cost of apathy is more severe than just social disconnection: “There’ll be war in our cities/ and riots at the mall,” Menuck warns, before repeating his most chilling prognostication four times—“all our children gonna die.” All the while, the rest of the band sings, “and the day has come, when we no longer feel,” the sweetest of harmonies couching the bitterest of sentiments—i.e. that numbing oneself to atrocities is the only way to endure them.</p>
<p>And yet, amid this procession of devastation, Menuck sees a sliver of a silver lining, when he sings, “kiss it quick and it’ll rise again,” and the album’s closing track, “Rains Thru the Roof at the Grande Ballroom (For Capital Steez)”, channels that cautious optimism into a dreamlike haze that's equally haunting and comforting. Its title name-checks the Detroit theatre where The MC5 recorded their incendiary 1968 debut, <i>Kick Out the Jams</i>, and the song is introduced by an interview clip in which guitarist Fred “Sonic” Smith issues a statement of purpose that Thee Silver Mt. Zion could easily claim as their own: “Music is a way of life, it’s more than just something you do on the weekend … it’s something you devote your life to.” But more than simply forge a spiritual connection between Thee Silver Mt. Zion and their proto-punk forefathers, the song’s central image—of a once-legendary venue reduced to ruins—serves as a symbol for the loss of radicalism in popular music.</p>
<p>And through that lens, the parenthetical shout-out to Pro Era rapper Capital Steez—who threw himself off a New York City building in late 2012—makes more sense, as a requiem for a kindred, politically outspoken voice silenced before his time. But for all the sorrow couched in Menuck’s trembling tenor, there is a sign of life amid the Grande Ballroom rubble: “The glass in its windows are still breathing,” he sings, suggesting the same anti-establishment ethos that fuelled a band of Motor City delinquents in the late-60s, and his own cabal of Montreal outsiders in the late-90s, and a teenaged Brooklyn MC in the early 2010s will persist long after he’s gone. Back in 2003, when this once-instrumental band was still literally finding its voice, Thee Silver Mt. Zion asserted their core ideology by naming their third album <i>This Is Our Punk-Rock</i>, and the increasingly aggressive albums released in the interim have made the members’ hardcore roots all the more apparent. But to ensure that the contrarian, questioning spirit of punk endures through future generations, <i>Fuck Off Get Free</i> reminds us of one of the key principles of hippiedom: teach your children well.  </p></div>"|18855.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18855-thee-silver-mt-zion-memorial-orchestra-fuck-off-get-free-we-pour-light-on-everything/|8.0|Stuart Berman

It's a shot that communicates things like “time has passed, slowly but surely” and “the character you're about to see has been through some deep contemplation!” But it works because there <i>is</i> something about the stark calm of late winter that seems to match up with those periodic spells of reflection, the slow, occasional seasons we spend gradually and deliberately healing or learning. They stretch on forever and then are suddenly complete. They feel like a dream.</p>
<p>Irish singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31811-james-vincent-mcmorrow/"" target=""_blank"">James Vincent McMorrow</a>'s sophomore effort <i>Post Tropical </i>is an album that seems suited to such seasons. It's a winter album in ways that go beyond its release date, with lyrics about “elements of frost” and “cold air” and taut, pensive songs that carry a pristine stillness. There are spare, open moments of longing vocals over solitary piano notes and stabs of sunny revelations in the periodic horn arrangements and cymbal crashes. Above all, <i>Post Tropical</i> is pretty. It's also the type of music to grow with for a little while as a personal soundtrack, a companion for a few months that one might fondly check in with from time to time later on.</p>
<p>If the album has that intimacy, it's likely because <i>Post Tropical</i> comes as a more personal turn for McMorrow. His first album, <i>Early In The Morning</i>, was a comforting collection of guitar folk that found unexpected acclaim and commercial success, charting well in several European countries and landing McMorrow <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S59IYhvx-o0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">high-profile performances on <i>Later... With Jools Holland</i></a> and elsewhere. But the acoustic guitar wasn't, according to McMorrow, what he intended to stake his career on. Inspired by the rediscovery of an old hard drive full of efforts at recreating <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3021-nerd/"" target=""_blank"">N.E.R.D.</a> songs, the resulting departure on <i>Post Tropical</i> is an attempt to channel the spirit of the electronic music, R&amp;B and hip-hop that McMorrow likes to listen to.</p>
<p>In practice, the new bent means mostly swapping out the guitars for pianos and horns and using the occasional swatch of electronic drums. Although it does passingly resemble the low wattage D'Angelo tributes that get passed off on many blogs as R&amp;B, to call <i>Post Tropical </i>that does a disservice to both the genre and the album. McMorrow's falsetto, already impressive, gets pushed to new heights that <i>could </i>call to mind Maxwell but are more likely to inspire comparisons to others in the indie and folk sphere like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a>'s Justin Vernon or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27745-the-antlers/"" target=""_blank"">the Antlers</a>' Pete Silberman, particularly given the lyrical tone and a backing template that might feel at home on projects by either of those acts.</p>
<p>That voice is McMorrow's best tool, confessional and energizing whether he's hitting the unexpected climax of “there's no sense at all” on “Glacier” or using it to construct a plaintive mantra at the end of “Red Dust” with the repeated lyric, “sometimes my hands they don't feel like my own/ I need someone to love I need someone to hold.” The tone is pained, but the effect is both beautiful and comforting throughout, particularly in the way the album's songs often build to a single yearning, repeated phrase, like “I remember my first love” or “there is so little light from the warmth of the sun.”</p>
<p>Lyrically, the material is generally more oriented toward pulling emotions out of specific sounds of syllables than cohering into clear narratives or even realistic images (consider, for instance, that last line, from “Outside, Digging”, which sounds right but actually reverses cause and effect between light and warmth we're used to). The overall effect can be a little bit free associative, and it plays into the album's biggest weakness: While these songs are pretty, they don't really stand out as songs so much as meandering compositions that follow a similar, slow crescendo formula. There's nothing with the immediate structure or dramatic pull of a song like <i>Early in the Morning</i>'s “We Don't Eat”.</p>
<p>But if the album does tend to drift rather than deliver hits, the drifting is awfully pleasant and particularly accomplished. Songs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16224-cavalier/"" target=""_blank"">“Cavalier”</a>, “Outside, Digging” and especially “Red Dust”, an arresting blend of 808 drum machines and swirling piano, hit such memorable vocal highs that they feel both instantly familiar and starkly refreshing. At the same time, many of the best moments are more subtle surprises: the keening country guitars that swoop through the background of “The Lakes”, the flitter of clarinet that plays atop the plink of guitars at the end of “All Points”, the gorgeous depth of the low horn notes that build to the climax of “Glacier”. With its deliberate, languorous pleasures, this is an album to live with, settle with and be crisply rejuvenated by.</p></div>"|18895.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18895-james-vincent-mcmorrow-post-tropical/|7.1|Kyle Kramer

On his third album <i>Strong Feelings, </i>Paisley seeks refuge in the beauty of the romantic lyrical metaphors that have populated the genre since at least the heyday of Hank Williams. “The ice it breaks the midday sun / in springtime when the river runs,” he sings in “My Love”, one of the album’s most bracingly pretty numbers. Essentially, Paisley is saying, “Nature tends to stay in motion, so no matter how hard or deeply you love something it’s going to leave you eventually.” But it sounds so much sweeter the way he says it.    </p>
<p>Mortality is Paisley’s central theme; every life is overshadowed by the omnipresence of death, every romantic relationship dimmed by the inevitability of eventual separation. This is the subject matter of a zillion country songs, of course, but unlike that other, more famous country singer named Paisley (whose song <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fw5kOzGToec"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“This is Country Music”</a> extols the virtues of songwriting limned with the tangible directness of everyday language), Doug Paisley hears a song on the radio and feels suddenly lifted toward transcendence. “I turned the radio on 25 years ago/ And they were playing your song/ I looked for you on the town, thought I was tracking you down/ But you were there all along,” he croons on the gently chugging “Radio Girl”, and he’s either addressing an actual woman or equating what he’s just heard grace the airwaves with a long-lost love. In Doug Paisley’s songs, distinguishing between what’s “real” and what’s felt scarcely matters.</p>
<p>After a dues-paying tenure as a classic country covers act and the release of his understated self-titled 2008 debut, Paisley broke through in 2010 with his sophomore effort, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15006-constant-companion/"" target=""_blank"">Constant Companion</a>, </i>which was helped along by high-profile co-stars like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1622-feist/"" target=""_blank"">Leslie Feist</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/614-the-band/"" target=""_blank"">the Band’s Garth Hudson</a>. For <i>Feelings, </i>Paisley retains producer Stew Crookes and Hudson, who contributes crisp and cozy organ lines to five of the album’s 10 tracks that are so warm you want to rub your hands over them. (His playing on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16402-song-my-love-can-sing/"" target=""_blank"">“Song My Love Can Sing”</a> is by itself the worth the price of admission.) Subbing in for Feist on harmony vocals is legendary Canadian singer-songwriter <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14904-mary-margaret-ohara/"" target=""_blank"">Mary Margaret O’Hara</a>, who adds another layer of winsome melancholy to “It’s Not Too Late (To Say Goodbye)”. The album’s main musical ingredients—finger-picked guitar, lightly brushed drums, relaxed though subtly emotive vocals—knowingly recall the quietest, most pained cuts on 70s outlaw country records and the twangiest numbers on that era’s rock-leaning singer-songwriter LPs. </p>
<p>Musically, <i>Strong Feelings </i>reiterates <i>Constant Companion, </i>which is fine, because it’s a good formula and Paisley’s songs are stronger this time. (He even musters up something resembling swagger on the steadily rocking “To and Fro”.) It’s a sound that comes wrapped in a warm glow of nostalgia that’s undercut by lyrics revealing the slow poison of lingering too long on your memories. “I turned the ground and found the roots still burning/ A night moon that lingers in a blue sky brings a yearning/ If it takes a waterfall to drown all my doubts/ Sometimes it takes a lie to let me know what it’s all about,” Paisley says in “Old Times”. Sometimes a song on the radio can feel like self-delusion in the cold, hard light of experience. No matter the short-term pleasure it provides, life marches inexorably toward an uncertain destination. But Paisley seems content to turn it up anyway and let the music carry him away to a better place.  </p></div>"|18853.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18853-doug-paisley-strong-feelings/|7.5|Steven Hyden

In all these cases, extreme metal was the chrysalis or catalyst; what emerged wasn’t the same as what came before. Opeth shed death metal for bucolic prog; Darkthrone bent black metal toward d-beat crust. Neither came as a total surprise, and neither does <i>Shelter</i>. Alcest have been slowly turning away from the corrosive, ambient metal of their early work—a sound that’s influenced many, most notably <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"" target=""_blank"">Deafheaven</a>—toward an unbroken dreamscape of cushiony shoegaze. <i>Shelter</i> marks that clean break. The French outfit’s fourth full-length is a statement of soft-spoken apostasy that’s unflinching in its resolve. And somewhat less than stellar in its execution.</p>
<p>The friction between ethereality and aggression is what made Alcest’s prior albums, and in particular 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14164-ecailles-de-lune/"" target=""_blank""><i>Écailles de Lune</i></a>, so gripping. Quiet, chiming guitars meshed with thunderous riffs, and liquid-nitrogen synths bled into a bath of warm, soft vocals. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/6659-show-no-mercy/"" target=""_blank"">Neige</a>, the driving force behind Alcest, has allowed that friction to dissipate. What’s left feels wrung-out. <i>Shelter</i>’s eight songs are among the prettiest Neige has ever composed, with the happy-sad chords and bell-like hook of “Opale” bearing an unmistakable to resemblance to Chapterhouse’s “Breather”. But even Chapterhouse, among the wispiest of shoegaze groups, put more propulsion and surprise into their songs. Throughout <i>Shelter </i>that delicacy never lets up. Some tracks, like “La Nuit Marche Avec Moi” and “Voix Sereines”, muster enough determination to step on a distortion pedal. Beyond that, every element—from Neige’s whispery melodies to the shimmering sameness of the guitar—sticks unswervingly to the path of least resistance.</p>
<p><i>Shelter</i> leaves no room for the questioning of its shoegaze credentials. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4105-slowdive/"" target=""_blank"">Slowdive</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1878-neil-halstead/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Halstead</a> is brought aboard to sing the lead vocals on “Away”, yet the shoegaze founding father sounds more deflated than dreamy as he moans through the song’s vaguely chamber-folk arrangement. Something is supposed to be evoked here: bemused melancholy, maybe, or wistful longing, or pensive detachment. Whatever it is, it never coheres or connects. At least it’s a break in the fog, even if it only offers a slightly bluer hue of featureless prettiness. The album was recorded in Iceland at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"" target=""_blank"">Sigur Rós’</a> studio, Sundlaugin, with Sigur Rós producer Birgir Jón Birgisson, but it doesn’t sound appreciably different than Alcest’s previous output—let alone allow for much internal variation.</p>
<p>The 10-minute closer “Délivrance” nearly reaches escape velocity, a listless spiral of gossamer pop with brief bursts of distorted lucidity. It too collapses under its own lack of weight. Neige has stated in the past that Alcest is a project devoted to realizing in song his visions of otherworldly fantasy and wonder. In chasing that devotion, the songs themselves have been cast adrift. Still capable of great feats of mood and beauty, Alcest have transformed themselves, although not always in the best way. They’ve gone from being a remarkably innovative, influential, and singular force in a subgenre they helped create to being just another shoegaze act. That doesn’t make <i>Shelter </i>a bad album. As an aural analgesic, it goes down smooth and numbs what it needs to. But instead of tearing open the passageway between this world and whatever lies beyond, it shrinks that portal to the size of a keyhole.</p></div>"|18901.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18901-alcest-shelter/|6.6|Jason Heller

There are several other records that arguably provide an answer to this question whether anyone asked it or not, but it’s hard to think of an example that does so as consummately as </span><i>Graze</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, whose six tracks between them drew a detailed map of the hidden paths between the febrile percussion and garage swing of the post-dubstep era and “proper” techno’s motorway velocity, managing to sound simultaneously classicist and inventive in the process.</span></p>
<p>The verb “digested” is used deliberately here, since the vibe of Adam Marshall and Christian Andersen’s music seems to privilege techno’s sonic preoccupations, even if only by presenting the duo’s more fashionable production tactics (quantised percussion, chopped breaks, lasciviously thick hi-hats) as nothing particularly special or fetish-worthy in their own right. Instead, those conventions are more useful as components to be woven into broader homages to techno’s hypnotic propulsion. And the metaphor of digestion helps to make sense of the duo’s exploration of their blueprint on their latest effort. <i>Edges </i>technically is Graze’s debut album, though given the preceding EP just fell short of 40 minutes, the distinction seems largely academic. And the differences between <i>Graze </i>and <i>Edges </i>even feel like a classic first album/second album progression: <i>Graze </i>offering a fully-formed and distinct aesthetic which its follow-up then strips down to its absolute bare essentials.</p>
<p>As flagged by the cold modernism of the album cover (the sharp right angle where two metal bars meet), on tracks like “Cold Drop”, “Airror” and “Stack Array” it’s as if Graze are deliberately targeting and exterminating the sense of warmth that once bubbled up through their grooves, now living on only as fossilised remnants. What manages to survive this deliberate purge is the duo’s exacting approach to beat programming, deployed with such precision that it’s easy not to notice just how spare some of these arrangements are. Even when Graze are leaning hard on the steady thump of a kickdrum, the choice feels conscious and precarious, as if at any point the groove might become pulled out of orbit by a latticework of stern, stiff-jointed counter-rhythms and ominous basslines. “Cold Drop” in particular makes a virtue of minimalism, its stentorian groove built around the queasy shudder of a one-note dub bass throb, but it never <i>feels </i>minimal. Instead, the progressive introduction of (a very small number of) new elements takes on an air of occasion and unpredictability, as if the sudden arrival of a threatening, throbbing metallic bass riff was an unexpected new twist in an unfolding melodrama.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to the new world order. Most notably, opener “Skip/Crush”<i> </i>lives up to its title with a swung groove that seems to flutter against its own confines, its bittersweet synth chords rubbing up against the beat in a manner that feels almost tremulous, while “GoldN” offers a dreamy broken beat scape reminiscent of the first Dettinger album. But as lovely as these moments are, and notwithstanding the success with which Graze tackle more straight-laced rhythms, <i>Edges</i> misses some of the startling charm of the debut EP’s experiments with syncopation. This is less a problem for this album than, perhaps, what Graze might do next: if these qualities get further digested to the point of imperceptibility, then Graze might simply become another good techno outfit. Which is fine, but less exciting than the potential alternative paths you can still hear stretching out from this music.</p>
<p>Graze would do well to give their narrativist impulse freer rein and find out where it takes them: <i>Edges</i>’ most startling and compelling track is “Scrap”, an almost comically Spartan concoction of sharply syncopated programmed beats and slivering synth-bass sludge which imagines a form of minimalist techno grown entirely from the starting point of Cabaret Voltaire circa 1984. Whereas the album’s more resolutely techno efforts make the (familiar) point that a reduced palette of sounds can allow for a more involved listener experience, “Scrap” sidesteps the issue entirely by virtue of its almost impolite rhythmic boldness. Less digestion, then, than symbiotic transformation, the host and the pathogen combining to form organisms neither could have anticipated.</p></div>"|18883.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18883-graze-edges/|7.2|Tim Finney

The first song to be released from the album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16252-remurdered/"">""Remurdered""</a>, certainly hinted that analog sounds would form a more rigorous backbone to their music than before, although they've been dabbling in this area since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5365-rock-action/""><i>Rock Action</i></a> in 2001. In truth, ""Remurdered"" is something of a red herring. If that song feels like a fuller manifestation of ideas that have taken over a decade for Mogwai to reach, <i>Rave Tapes</i> mostly tells a different story—one that digs harder into a place they've consistently circled back to throughout their career.</p>
<p>This is the second Mogwai album in less than a year, following their creepy 2013 soundtrack to the French TV show <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17764-mogwai-les-revenants/""><i>Les Revenants</i></a>. That album is among the most introspective work they've ever recorded—no mean feat for a band so inward facing—and it's a tone they've only modestly advanced on for <i>Rave Tapes</i>. It's not hard to pull all the elements together and theorize at how they arrived at the humorous title for the record, which reads as a direct inverse to the morose worldview of the album and a poke at anyone thinking they’ve ""gone electronic."" Still, that's hard to square with a track like ""Master Card"", where the circular guitar motions they so often make remain front and center, and the analog sounds skirting across the surface only serve to keep familiar dynamics intact. The past hangs heavy on the shoulders of these guys, seemingly always keeping them in check even when you think they've reached a point of separation with it.</p>
<p>It's been 17 years since Mogwai’s debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11600-young-team-2008-edition/""><i>Young Team</i></a>. That album emerged with stories of the band members taking on assumed identities and shaving their heads before entering the studio—a totemic representation of their full-blooded commitment to the cause, analogous to going into battle. It isn't hard to figure out who the major influences were on the band back then, but Mogwai had a combative feel that many of their peers shied away from. They had the air of a band that you committed to, that you argued over. There's been a natural fade away from that youthful starting point, as well there should be—it's not really befitting for a group of dads in their late 30s to enter a recording studio like they’re going to bootcamp. But still, there are elements left behind that could benefit from being intact on <i>Rave Tapes</i>, such as the astonishing ebb and flow of ""Mogwai Fear Satan"", or even odd impulses like getting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1356-roky-erickson/"">Roky Erickson</a> to guest on a track. Instead, it's hard to see what this offers that we don't already have.</p>
<p><i>Rave Tapes</i> is the work of an oddly conservative band, turning away from the openness they once embraced. At some point Mogwai got less interested in testing the boundaries of their music, instead settling for being comfortable working within them. The bass-y keyboard grind that emerges at times is a new appendage, but the material it's dressed up in strains under the weight of familiarity, ultimately resembling an exercise in Mogwai box-ticking. So here comes the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18712-codeine/"">Codeine</a>-lite vocal piece (""Blues Hour""), here comes the one with the vocoder (""The Lord is Out of Control""), here comes the one with the funny title (""Simon Ferocious""), here comes the one with the sampled spoken word dialogue (""Repelish""). It's hard to shake the feeling that this is a band trapped in their own creation, occasionally looking for somewhere else to go but unable or unwilling to fully get there.</p>
<p>Most groups don't leave behind the core signifiers that bring them attention in the first place, so Mogwai are far from an isolated case when it comes to looping back on themselves. In many ways they're victims of their earlier snottiness and ambition. The screaming guitars of ""Like Herod"", the sheer beauty of ""Helicon 2"", the bratty spat with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"">Blur</a>, the punk nihilism of calling an album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5369-come-on-die-young/""><i>Come On Die Young</i></a>—they don't need to return to such things, but it does make the level of complacency they're operating at now such a baffling and frustrating end game to it all. At this point it feels like there isn't anywhere else they can go with this music, so infinitesimally small are the strides taken toward a better place. Mogwai have worked heavily in the visual realm in the last year, on <i>Les Revenants</i> and a live performance of their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9617-zidane-a-21st-century-portrait-ost/""><i>Zidane</i></a> soundtrack. Maybe the cliché about instrumental bands creating ""soundtracks for films that don't exist"" has a grain of truth for them after all. Here, Mogwai’s cautionary approach all but drowns out the faint echoes of the once brave band struggling to get out from within.</p></div>"|18896.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18896-mogwai-rave-tapes/|6.0|Nick Neyland

The result does for post-punk what <i>Nuggets</i> did for late 60s garage rock, unearthing bizarre bands who produce oddities and competent facsimiles of more popular bands in equal measure. But also like <i>Nuggets,</i> what makes <i>Killed By Deathrock</i> so invigorating is that it's simply so fun—just put it on, let it rip, and make sure you play it loud.<br/><br/> Whatever idea ""deathrock"" might bring to mind, throw it away—from the opening moments of Your Funeral's ""I Wanna Be You,"" it's a surprisingly sprightly, even bouncy album that's more hi-fidelity than you'd expect. The jangly guitars on the first track practically pop-out in 3D, and most of the others follow suit, underlining what was either a careful search for the master tapes or simply some remastering wizardry. The compilation's best moments are these buoyant ones—Afterimage's ""Satellite Of Love"" (not a Lou Reed cover) is a meaty anthem with a stellar vocal performance, while fellow Americans Screaming For Emily steal the spotlight with ""The Love"", whose sly vocal performance could be a precursor for Britpop were it not for the excited drumming and wonderfully cheesy choral synth work.<br/><br/> As with so many post-punk also-rans, the spectre of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a> hangs heavy over the compilation (try not to hear ""Transmission"" in the central riff of ""Satellite Of Love""). Peter Hook basslines are the order of the day. Sometimes it's bald-faced, as with Italian obscurities Move, and sometimes it's a bit more clever, like Frenchmen Bunker (later Bunker Strasse), who take the production style of <i>Unknown Pleasures</i> and give it a good coat of fuzz. The undeniable pilfering is an artifact of the compilation's nature—it's a collection of pleasing offcuts rather than long lost gems.<br/><br/> Not that there aren't some of those. Germany's Taste Of Decay are more punk than post, and their cheap entry-level distortion feels viscerally satisfying next to the other bands' chillier styles of production. The aptly-named Kitchen &amp; The Plastic Spoons (a short-lived Swedish ""goof band"") sound like Magazine gone mad with wriggly synths and hilariously affected vocals. The latter are an especially weird inclusion, and it highlights the best part of <i>Killed By Deathrock</i>—discovering these strange little bands that time forgot.  Not all of them are worth exploring, certainly, but bands like Screaming For Emily (and their 1987 album <i>Scriptures</i>) and Bunker Strasse bear further investigation.<br/><br/> None of that would matter if the compilation weren't well-executed. But from the clever artwork to the sound quality, Sacred Bones have outdone themselves, and the urge of so many compilation curators to pack a CD within an inch of its life is forgone in favour of a highly listenable 40-minute album. Considering it spans almost a whole decade, it's remarkably well-sequenced too—you might not guess that Screaming For Emily came a whole seven years later than Kitchen &amp; The Plastic Spoons. <i>Killed By Deathrock</i> is clearly a well-researched labour of love. It might seem a bit slight for seven years in the making, but hopefully that just means there'll be more down the line.</p></div>"|18856.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18856-killed-by-deathrock-vol-1/|8.0|Andrew Ryce

If you’ve seen him act in films, all you need to hear is titles like <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088184/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stranger Than Paradise</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090967/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Down By Law</a></i> to be reminded of his distinctive speaking and gesturing. Yet even though he can steal a scene, he rarely comes across as an egotist. In fact, he’s usually a consummate collaborator. Though his most recent pursuit, <a href=""http://johnlurieart.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">painting</a>, is a solo venture, he has mostly preferred collectivism, from the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Wave_Cinema"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">no wave films</a> he directed in the late 70s, to his 90s pseudo-nature-show <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139776/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fishing With John""</a> (in which he bantered masterfully with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"">Tom Waits</a>, Willem Dafoe, and Dennis Hopper), to his most communal project, the punk-informed jazz outfit <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lounge_Lizards"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lounge Lizards</a>, whose rotating lineup included at least 30 different members.</p>
<p>This penchant for collaboration extended even to the band that took his name, the John Lurie National Orchestra, who sounded more like a democratic group than a star vehicle. This despite the fact that they were just a trio, comprising Lurie on saxophones and <a href=""http://www.billymartin.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Billy Martin</a> and Calvin Weston—both Lounge Lizards—on drums. That instrumental setup makes Lurie obstensibly the leader, and indeed on <i>The Invention of Animals </i>—a posthumous collection of live recordings and studio tracks used for ""Fishing With John"" episodes—his playing is more free-flowing than the steady, loop-like drumming of his colleagues. But it never feels like Lurie is the commander and Martin and Weston are soldiers following orders. Every sonic element is equally important, and the mesh the three men weave forms both the spine and the heart of each track.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The result of that mesh is a restrained, subdued record. The trio is in no hurry to get anywhere other than where they started, and more interested in stitching patterns together than fighting for elbow room. Filled with repetition and space, this isn’t exactly trance music, but it certainly has a way of making you feel hypnotized. So the tension on </span><i>The Invention of Animals </i><span>comes not from rapid shifts in tempo or volume, but smaller, more subtle variations. Playing things this low and understated can be risky; it would be easy for the group to drift into colorless new age reverie. But even the mellowest moments bubble with ideas and energy.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">That’s true even in the few instances where Lurie steps out in front of his comrades. Take the ballad-like “Little”, which is practically a Lurie solo. Here, his wistful soprano notes are central, but tiny clicks of percussion in the background are just as crucial, giving charge to a piece that could otherwise freeze. Similar dynamics mark the beginning of </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Invention</span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">’s peak, the closing title track. The build here is particularly mind-bending, as the trio navigate a series of crests by precisely modulating their levels of activity and pressure. Yet that precision never sounds clinical. There’s blood coursing through every second of the piece, in a way that makes it feel half its 19-minute length.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">So much blood, in fact, that it’s hard to fathom why the John Lurie National Orchestra isn’t an ongoing concern. Lurie himself has been out of the public eye in recent years, at least compared to his busy presence in the 80s and 90s as an always-interesting actor, director, and musician. If you’re unfamiliar with that latter role, there are some great Lounge Lizards records out there waiting for you. But </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">The Invention of Animals </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">is just as good a place to start, and hopefully it will help get people talking again about a man who’s carved out one of the most unique American artistic careers of the past four decades.</span></p></div>"|18865.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18865-the-john-lurie-national-orchestra-the-invention-of-animals/|7.5|Marc Masters

He may well be the most idiosyncratic man operating in a trio that hardly prides itself on taking route one, something of a bellwether for the label's more esoteric tendencies. Short of the lung-busting run undertaken by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29526-pearson-sound/"">Pearson Sound</a> (née Ramadanman) across 2010, and without the worldie acclaim lavished upon <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30976-ben-ufo/"">Ben UFO</a> for his ability to satiate crowds of thousands with unheralded obscurities, McAuley has just never had a major moment. A couple of clear-cut chances arose--surging hype following half-junglist, half-mentalist behemoth <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kwbkbLcGno"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hex""</a>; the opportunity to usher in Hessle's first definitive full-length--and duly passed--over a year's silence; the thorny and unmoored <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17395-release/"">Release</a></i>, flaunted as a double EP in spite of its 43-minute runtime. This likely won't raise Pangaea's profile beyond the usual bounce, but you get the sense he's comfortable with that.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Which makes it all the more pleasing that McAuley bites his tongue and chooses to play it straight on the techno-centric <i>Fabriclive 73</i><i>,</i> a seriously enjoyable, three-dimensional installment in the long-running series that exudes confidence at every turn. The Fabric name doubles up as a seal of quality, imbuing each commercial mix with a lofty expectation, but how jocks wield the weapon varies greatly. Shelved adjacent to recent editions by affiliates such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17013-fabriclive-64/""><span>Oneman</span></a>, replete with belters to carve up the dance, the contrasts are stark. Even his aforementioned comrades' logs in the guestbook offered more concessions than this: <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15229-fabriclive-56/"">56</a></i> juggled disparate styles but quickly settled on big-hitters (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28029-joy-orbison/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Orbison</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4645-wiley/"" target=""_blank"">Wiley</a>) while <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17553-fabriclive-67/"">67</a></i> shuffled classic material from Larry Heard and Matthew Herbert into the pack alongside more specialist fare. McAuley simply rolls up his sleeves, tacks a ""No Requests"" sign to the booth window, and kicks off.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Given every mix is a snapshot of </span><i>something</i><span>, here McAuley uses his vaunted platform to articulate a compelling case for the state of the UK techno in 2014, facilitating a digestible entry point for those looking to throw themselves headfirst into the trenches. The mix may not shine especial light onto any one trend in particular--you'd need your ears planted pretty firmly to the ground to pick much out of the tracklist--but that represents a key facet of precisely why excitement continues to froth. A scene typecast as cloistered and cagey appears wide open, glowing with a vitality</span><span> </span><span>no doubt borne of a brisk influx of new faces, internally migrating from other colonies in droves. Thankfully McAuley avoids cronyism, instead drawing upon a healthy Continental contingent and packing in a multitude of different styles under the genre umbrella, scraping off the extremities and compacting them into his own winding vision.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>He opts to tee up one of his own, the hitherto unreleased ""Recreational Slumming"", as if to deliver a pithy, polite bow before getting on with it. Immediately established, that clunking kick thud largely operates as a constant, a tour guide as McAuley applies variegations of light and shade all around it. The opening run bounds through eight tracks in 20 minutes, bearing down through a dense thicket of background detail at speed, often rendering artists as motion blurs: the hollowed atmospherics of jungle repairman Lee Gamble's ""Plos 97"" naturally slides into Hodge's ""Resolve"", a track writhing with unresolved tension; static cracks begin to emerge in Shifted's hardbodied cut before they split open, revealing a floor of swarming, chattering insects in Manni Dee’s “Romantic Self” down the way; in both cases, whole tracks were devoured in between.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>McAuley's mixing is fluid, using one-touch bursts of bass to denote new arrivals, employing some intermingling blends but generally delivering rightward swipes off the assembly line once tracks serve their purpose. By lacing rhythms together with dainty flair he keeps a good thrust going, applying the brakes at choice moments when the runaway momentum encroaches on exhausting. One sole misstep comes after the impressively varied midsection, when Adam Jay's dull ""Refraction"" threatens to break the spell, reminiscent of waiting in a lengthy bathroom queue, sound filtering weakly through from the dancefloor; thankfully Pearson Sound's enormous rattler ""Starbust"" lives up to its billing, taking a boltgun and blasting a hole clean through the drywall. Two more of last year’s highlights, Stenny &amp; Andrea's ""Sea (The Time Gate)"" and Pev &amp; Kowton's ""End Point"", are repurposed as memorable bridges, melodies floating above the mass below.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It takes until the Exposure edit of Speedy J's 1992 fistpumper ""Something For Your Mind""—one of only two cuts predating 2011—for a vocal to worm its way in, the infectious refrain slicing through the spine of the mix, a total highlight. From there the frame begins to collapse. Thick, rough-edged stacks topple in quick succession, until the sediment crumbles from beneath, leaving Astronomical Telegram to finally disappear into the sinkhole. </span><i>Fabriclive 73 </i><span>is complex and confrontational but resolutely unshowy, an honest indication of the kind of pummeling 3am set you would have heard McAuley bang out over the past 18 months; all told, a worthy completion of the Hessle triptych and an excellent standalone in its own right.</span></p></div>"|18893.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18893-pangaea-fabriclive-73/|7.7|Gabriel Szatan

Bush's first term, there's a good chance you saw a band that sounded a lot like Boston five-piece Guerilla Toss. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3389-entertainment/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank""><i>Entertainment!</i></a> was most likely on the stereo, someone was wearing <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/03297-lightning-bolt-interview-earthly-delights-the-quest-for-the-sacred-mask"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a raggedy, technicolor Brian Chippendale mask</a>, and there was probably <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1580561/guerilla-toss-pink-elephant/mp3s/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a guy walking around with his dick hanging out</a>. While it's been some time since anyone's uttered the words ""dance punk"" in any valuable context, Guerilla Toss seem hell bent on stirring up a noisy revival that's more no wave than new wave. Channeling everything from the fractured funk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6692-out-of-the-races-and-onto-the-tracks-ep/"" target=""_blank"">pre-<i>Echoes</i> Rapture</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Black Dice</a>'s anti-grooves, and the tinnitus-beckoning mania of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2481-lightning-bolt/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Lightning Bolt</a>, their latest LP <i>Gay Disco</i> is a freak-flag waving love letter for a time when the weirdos learned to stop worrying and love getting down in as awkward a fashion as possible.</p>
<p>For an album that sounds as haphazard and caustic as <i>Gay Disco</i> does, each instrument seems designed to play a very specific role. Eschewing a traditional sense of tunefulness, Guerilla Toss bring the back of the band to the fore, relying on Simon Hanes' skronked-out bass and drummer Peter Negroponte's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink thrash to do most of the heavy lifting. Arian Shaifee's guitar (and Ian Kovac's synth work, for that matter) seems like an afterthought most of the time, operating like a sound effects machine rather than an object capable of creating melody (on ""Operate"", it calls to mind a wounded seal pup helplessly honking for its mother). But the most noteworthy instrument of all might be Kassie Carlson's vocals, that range between a tuned-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/5-10-15-20/9255-kathleen-hanna/"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hanna</a> and, as most are quick to notice, Molly Siegel of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5037-ponytail/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Ponytail</a>. Despite how unintelligible her squawking might be, there's an invigorating brattiness that, in a small way, is welcomingly reminiscent of those now-defunct Baltimore art-punks.</p>
<p>If the title wasn't any sort of a giveaway, it's clear that <i>Gay Disco</i> is a record that encourages movement, no matter how spastic it may be. When Guerilla Toss find reliable stretches of groove, like on single <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1604721/guerilla-toss-pink-elephant-video/video/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Pink Elephant""</a> (an abrasive take on early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1831-gang-gang-dance/"" target=""_blank"">Gang Gang Dance</a>), it's easy to enjoy <i>Gay Disco</i> as a functional expression of wiggy, wild energy. Even the nauseous, acidic ""Operate"" feels tailor-made to accompany the undulations of a drunken marionette. But <i>Gay Disco</i> ultimately operates like a series of clumsily threaded distractions, constantly trying to prove its irreverence with vertigo-inducing tempo changes and abrasion for the sake of abrasion. Where a band like Ponytail were able to coax beauty, color, and catharsis out of the wreckage, Guerilla Toss' similarly clamorous approach registers as almost gimmicky.<a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1558882/boston-hassle-fest-5-in-words-and-photos/concert/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1558882/boston-hassle-fest-5-in-words-and-photos/concert/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heralded for their energetic live shows</a>, it's likely <i>Gay Disco</i> translates much better in person, able to finally make good on its intent to be simultaneously punchy and debilitating. But in the comfort of your own headphones, it's migraine-inducing even at a half hour, a record that should be the furthest thing from your reach even during the mildest of hangovers. To say that it's all a bit much would be an understatement, but neglecting to embrace that on some level would be to miss the point entirely. And still, something here registers as hollow, as <i>Gay Disco</i> is more a test of patience than an example of eccentric fun.</p></div>"|18920.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18920-guerilla-toss-gay-disco/|6.0|Zach Kelly

M.C. Taylor wrote these songs in the months following the birth of his son in 2009, then he recorded them in the dead of the North Carolina winter on a cassette recorder at his kitchen table, playing softly so as not to wake the household. Taylor was all set to release those recordings as </span><i>Bad Debt</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, his first wide release as </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30386-hiss-golden-messenger/"">Hiss Golden Messenger</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, but the CD stock was destroyed during the London riots of 2010, when his distributor’s warehouse was burned. The opening chords of “No Lord Is Free” sound all the more resolute for cutting so gingerly through the ambient hiss of Taylor’s kitchen.</span></p>
<p>It’s almost impossible to imagine the magnitude of such a setback for any artist, but especially for one trying to launch a new venture. That story has attached itself like a tall tale to the album, at least for those intrigued listeners who have dug deeper into Taylor’s catalog following the subsequent release of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16546-poor-moon/"" target=""_blank""><i>Poor Moon </i></a>in 2011 and the mighty <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17819-hiss-golden-messenger-haw/"" target=""_blank""><i>Haw</i></a> in 2013. Yet neither story affects how we hear these modest and deeply moving songs three years later, when <i>Bad Debt</i> is finally getting a proper release—with three new tracks—via the Tar Heel State indie <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=paradise+of+bachelors"">Paradise of Bachelors</a>. There are two reasons this tale of tribulation persists: First, it exposes the consequences of that fire and makes very real the sense of monetary and professional loss. Second—and much, much more crucial—that fire seems almost biblical in nature, as though God Himself reached down and smote Taylor. It is a tribulation worthy of Job.</p>
<p>“Are you with me now”? Taylor sing-whispers at the very start of the album. He delivers the line in a hush, even before the guitar enters, and that question resonates as both a gentle invitation to the listener and an invocation of a heavenly host. <i>Bad Debt </i>is an album deeply concerned with the nature of faith and man’s relationship with his Maker. That title pretty much sums up the spiritual dynamic, although who owes what to whom remains mysterious and unresolved. The homespun quality of these recordings is crucial: They are raw and rough, humble and private.</p>
<p>He makes good use of that room. Listening to these dozen songs, you can almost measure its dimensions. That space and the lo-fi recording technology create a rustic reverb, as his strums and singing reverberate quietly against the walls. To that simple palette—which recalls the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5715-the-tallest-man-on-earth/"">Tallest Man on Earth</a> at his most reserved or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4553-m-ward/"">M. Ward</a> at his most forceful—Taylor adds what sounds like a foot tapping against the floor to “Straw Man Red Sun River Gold” and “The Serpent Is Kind (Compared to Man)”. On “Call Him Daylight” his vocals echo slightly, suggesting a conflicted soul. These are subtle flourishes, yet they add urgency and depth to these songs and reinforce the sense of a live performance or a late-night rumination. </p>
<p>That field-recording aesthetic is the musical equivalent of sackcloth, especially compared to the lusher Appalachian folk-rock arrangements on his subsequent albums<i>. </i>Heard in the skewed chronology of the growing Hiss Golden Messenger catalog, <i>Bad Debt</i> may strike some listeners as mere demos, yet there is nothing missing from these performances, no sense of potential left untapped. These songs sound full and finished even in their austerity. Even so, a deep sense of uncertainty pervades every syllable and every strum, as though no question can ever be answer satisfactorily, and it is precisely that spiritual disaffection that separates Taylor from the artists for whom God’s existence and benevolence are givens. Rather than cynical or despairing, however, <i>Bad Debt</i> sounds hopeful, exuding a sense of hushed celebration. These are, after all, songs sung by a new dad.</p></div>"|18834.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18834-hiss-golden-messenger-bad-debt/|8.2|Stephen M. Deusner

Of all the handsome, long-haired Emerald City singers to front rock bands that sold hundreds of thousands of records in the early 90s, Lanegan ranked a distant fifth in high-school-locker pin-up potential, exuding neither the bare-chested sex appeal of Chris Cornell and Eddie Vedder nor the fashionable misanthropy of Kurt Cobain and Layne Staley. Even within the context of his own band, the Screaming Trees, Lanegan felt like the odd man out, his bronchial drawl serving as a grainy, black-and-white contrast to the band’s kaleidoscopic surges.</span></p>
<p>In the midst of the Trees' brief run as 90s alterna-darlings, Lanegan refashioned himself as an old soul who wanted nothing to do with a young man’s game, releasing a handful of simmered-down solo releases on Sub Pop steeped in blues and Americana traditions that presented a more natural fit for his slow-and-low singing style. Though it initially counted as something of an anomoly amid Sub Pop’s super-fuzzed roster, Lanegan's 1990 debut, <i>The Winding Sheet</i>, was a harbinger of the label’s post-grunge tilt toward the torn 'n' frayed roots-rock of the Friends of Dean Martinez, Red Red Meat, the Scud Mountain Boys and the like (though today the album is probably most remembered as the record that gave Kurt Cobain <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eujkWXfSl0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the idea to cover Leadbelly</a>). And following the Trees’ official dissolution in 2000, Lanegan’s outlaw ethos would become further entrenched, both on his own increasingly spartan solo releases, and his mercenary approach to collaborating with everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"" target=""_blank"">Queens of the Stone Age</a> to former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"" target=""_blank"">Belle and Sebastian</a> chanteuse <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/905-isobel-campbell/"" target=""_blank"">Isobel Campbell</a>. But despite his considerable C.V., Lanegan typifies the classic singer-not-the-song conundrum, as he's better known for personifying a certain mysterious vibe—with a fistful of tattoos to go with it—than for his deep canon of black ‘n’ bruised ballads. Even when he’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB3KD3pDozw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stealing the spotlight</a>, Lanegan still seems like he’s lurking in the shadows, not so much singing a song as haunting it. So it’s appropriate that Lanegan’s now receiving the sort of elaborate retrospective treatment that most artists don’t get till they’re dead.</p>
<p>Though it spans two discs and 32 tracks, <i>Has God Seen My Shadow?</i> is by no means a definitive compendium of Lanegan’s work, focussing squarely on material released under his own name while steering clear of his countless extracirricular projects and growl-for-hire guest appearances. As such, it’s a rather narrow overview of an artist whose interests and pursuits have proven far more eclectic than this stridently low-key collection would suggest. (Even the gnarlier extreme of his own songbook—like “Methamphetamine Blues” and “Message to Mine”—isn’t represented here, while the chronology also stops short of his most stylistically divergent album to date, 2012’s synth-colored <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16253-blues-funeral/"" target=""_blank""><i>Blues Funeral</i></a>.) But it also underscores how the popular image of Lanegan as the gruff, gravelly-voiced drifter is so often shaped by the company he keeps, the harsher qualities of his voice and personality amplified by his beauty-and-the-beast match-up with Campbell, or his showdowns against the more dramatic Greg Dulli in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5667-the-gutter-twins/"" target=""_blank"">the Gutter Twins</a>. The intimate nature of <i>Has God Seen My Shadow?</i> thus illuminates those qualities that often get overlooked in Lanegan’s high-profile pairings: his grace, tenderness, and self-deprecating sense of humour. </p>
<p>The set’s first disc employs an odd, loosely reverse-chronological sequence that groups tracks from each of Lanegan’s solo albums, starting with 2004’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4679-bubblegum-with-mark-lanegan-band/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bubblegum </i></a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4679-bubblegum-with-mark-lanegan-band/"" target=""_blank""></a>before tumbling deeper into the past. There’s a bit of a Benjamin Button effect at play in the march from the wood-cabin minimalism of “Bombed” and the creaky-door unease of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"" target=""_blank"">PJ Harvey</a> duet “Come to Me” back to 1994 release <i>Whiskey for the Holy Ghost</i>’s “Carnival” and “The River Rise"", the sort of mystical psych-folk odysseys you could easily imagine the Screaming Trees cutting for an MTV <i>Unplugged</i> session with a guest string section. But regardless of era, Lanegan’s work has always been tethered thematically to the twin poles of regret and redemption (this guy sings about saving his soul so much, he had to join the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13558-broken/"" target=""_blank"">Soulsavers</a>), and <i>Has God Seen My Shadow?</i> is a testament to his unwavering knack for coming up with clever ways to distill his endless bummer into a wickedly evocative one-liner: the seemingly optimistic titular refrain of <i>Holy Ghost</i>’s “Sunrise” is answered with “should’ve covered up my eyes,” while “One Way Street” (from 2001’s <i>Field Songs</i>) sets an instantly despairing scene when Lanegan intones, “stars and the moon aren't where they're supposed to be,” before taking a shot of whiskey and lamenting how he “can’t get it down without crying.” </p>
<p>The collection also shows all those <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Waits</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Cave</a> comparisons Lanegan gets saddled with to be somewhat offbase. Neither as wilfully eccentric as the former nor as outrageously provocative as the latter, <i>Has God Seen My Shadow?</i> posits Lanegan more as a patron saint to wounded romantics like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National</a>. His best songs disarm with their simple elegance and plaintive performances, like the downcast doo wop of “Pill Hill Serenade"", the breezy “Kimiko’s Dream House” (a songwriting collab with late Gun Club founder Jeffrey Lee Pierce), and “Last One in the World"", which could be the best ballad Keith Richards didn’t bring to the <i>Tatoo You</i> sessions. Disc two of <i>Has God Seen My Shadow?</i> presents a random grab-bag of previously unreleased material that ping-pongs between different periods—from a mellotron-swirled 98-era cover of John Cale’s “Big White Cloud” to a vocal version of the chilling 2001 instrumental “Blues for D” to a handful of raw, acoustic tracks recorded with QOTSA cohorts Troy Van Leeuwen and Alain Johannes in the mid-2000s—and while it may be short on revelations, it reinforces Lanegan’s consistency of vision. So it’s ironic that the set closes with a rare letting down of the guard: a live version of the Jackson C. Frank folk standard “Blues Run the Game” (recorded in Portland circa 2000) that gets derailed by sideman Mike Johnson’s short-circuiting guitar. But with some encouragement from the audience, Lanegan regains his composure to finish the song, putting into practice the philosophy that’s guided his long and winding career for over two decades: the best cure for the blues is to keep on keepin’ on.</p></div>"|18852.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18852-mark-lanegan-has-god-seen-my-shadow-an-anthology-1989-2011/|7.5|Stuart Berman

All things told, it worked—after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">M83</a> dropped <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12263-midnight-city/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">“Midnight City”</a>, forever more the canonical electronic shoegaze song, they took I Break Horses on the road as an opening act, surely a sign that an upstart synth-rock band is doing something right.</p>
<p>If I Break Horses are emboldened by their success, it manifests in how the duo are no longer concerning themselves with making a first impression; <i>Chiaroscuro</i> is a muted sophomore record that seeks to dole out its pleasures more subtly and slowly. Just witness the inversion that occurs between the introductory tracks on each record. Whereas <i>Hearts</i>’ “Winter Beats” evolved from Christmas-light arpeggios into a conflagration of digital distortion, the subzero atmosphere of “You Burn” is a constant, putting the emphasis on the first part of the title—someone’s ablaze, but it’s not Lindén, who maintains her typically unaffected, breathy tone. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Going forward, I Break Horses continue to hew towards minimal,</span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> streamlined electronics that dispatch any tie they once had to shoegaze—if there’s any woozy, pitch-shifting effects, they’re placed on Lindén‘s vocals, more akin to something you’d hear in the hauntological productions of a Tri Angle record rather than </span><i>Loveless</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">.</span></p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I Break Horses have pretty much dropped anything that could associate them with rock music. Not that guitars played a prominent role on <i>Hearts</i>, but they’re nowhere to be found here. And while the drums are cranked, Balck isn't trying to recreate booming arena-ready beats on minimalist beatboxes. To go even further, their influences over the past three years seem to be exclusively non-vocal electronic music—“Ascension” and “Berceuse” are indicative of how <i>Chiaroscuro</i> emphasizes the intricate, clattering snares you’d hear in trap, drag or footwork, rather than relying on Lindén to convey the message. Which is sensible, as Lindén’s lyrics don’t lend themselves to deep analysis, anyway. A typical line like “you burn/when words are burning/baby you burn/turn you turn/when the world is turning/baby you turn"" fails to generate even a mock profundity through Lindén's portentous cadence.</p>
<p>But through all this reduction, I Break Horses are left with little that they can call their own. Let’s note that “chiaroscuro” is a concept that has a lot of appeal to the amateur aesthete— after all, it’s a fancy word that encompasses light and shade, black and white. Problem is, I Break Horses are typical in failing to grasp how “chiaroscuro” entails a <i>strong</i> contrast between light and dark as a way of establishing dynamics and volume. “Medicine Brush” and closer “Heart to Know” are meant to be the record’s tentpoles, and instead underscore the album title as a misnomer, spreading billowing synth atmosphere, drizzly treble and murky grayscale over the span of seven minutes rather than the usual four and a half. Within the context of <i>Chiaroscuro</i>, certain gestures emerge as hooks—the cutting punctuations on Lindén‘s vocals during the chorus of “Denial”, a twisting neon synth line throughout “Faith."" But they need to stay within the context of <i>Chiaroscuro</i> to remain memorable. </p>
<p>While <i>Chiaroscuro</i> represents an admirable turn from what I Break Horses were doing on <i>Hearts</i>, the problem is that they’re moving in lockstep with their peers; even if <i>Chiaroscuro </i>doesn’t make the quick-strike, short-impact impression of <i>Hearts</i>, it lacks <i>any</i> means of impressing itself on the listener, something to distinguish I Break Horses from the countless electronic pop bands stuck in that vast netherworld between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30747-chvrches"">Chvrches</a>’ diamond-cutting, laser-guided melodies and the pitch black abstractions of pure production acts such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2"">the Haxan Cloak</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28780-holy-other"">Holy Other</a>. None of this makes <i>Chiaroscuro</i> anything less than pleasant, just a record whose middling between arena aspirations and headphones listening feels less of a fusion and more of a compromise.</p></div>"|18854.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18854-i-break-horses-chiaroscuro/|5.9|Ian Cohen

He's not even through with the sentence before he finds a way to bum himself out: ""...how come all I can remember is the strife?"" What's bugging Joe Galarraga? Well, whaddya got? Compulsive self medication, Gen Y apathy, the wastefulness of disposable razors: no matter the subject, Galarraga's got a few choice words on the topic. Throughout <i>Eighteen Hours of Static</i>, the arty Brooklyn post-punkers' howling debut LP, Galarraga and company put the world on notice. For 28 minutes, no grievance goes unaired, and no blood's left unlet.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, Big Ups were just your garden-variety <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1204-descendents/"" target=""_blank"">Descendents</a>-worshippers, proudly unsophisticated and gleefully juvenile. Over several singles and EPs, the music quickly grew fiercer, spinier, and Galarraga started singing like his life—and not just his next beer—depended on it. Veering from harrowing Touch &amp; Go-derived post-hardcore seethers, prickly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"" target=""_blank"">Fugazi</a>-inspired dub-punk, and the occasional dive into detuned grunge, <i>Static</i> is as serious as a severed nerve. Songs slide from denunciatory Shellac-inflected shouts to jittery Guy-and-Ian grooves in no time at all; the clip is manic, the atmosphere subterranean, but through every turn, Big Ups are in total control.</p>
<p>""With lips and mouths, we can kiss and shout,"" Galarraga screams a minute into opener ""Body Parts"", and the excoriations start piling up from there. ""TMI"" is the anti-technology screed: ""find it hard to unplug,"" he mutters, ""so reach for your favorite drug."" ""Atheist Self-Help"" suggests how little time Galarraga's got for organized religion: ""No one's gonna save you, so you gotta save yourself/ there's no fire and brimstone in your own personal hell."" Whether he's equating landfill-clogging waste with our churn-and-burn culture (""Disposer"") or tsk-tsking crust-punks for canine neglect (""Fresh Meat""), Galarraga's uproar is unrelenting. But, though Galarraga's not the type to take things lying down, he never seems to be shouting just to hear himself scream.</p>
<p>The relentless pace of modern life—and the attendant superficiality of quick-fix culture—is a refrain Galarraga returns to throughout <i>Static</i>. On ""Grin"", he's quick to chastise: ""We all think that we know best, but we're struggling just to catch our breaths."" On ""Goes Black"", he all but stammers ""sometimes I feel like the pace of my life is too fast, and I think about the time that's passed."" Galarraga's heart—to say nothing of his vitriol—seems to be in the right place. But few of the targets of his furor are new subjects for angry young punks, which—given Galarraga's relative lack of nuance—occasionally leaves his ""wake up, sheeple"" routine feeling a little underdeveloped, less a pointed manifesto than the notebook-margin scrawlings of the newly politicized. The gall is there, and the objects of his ire are clear. But unless you're already predisposed to his way of thinking, Galarraga screaming in your ear's not likely to change your mind.</p>
<p>Still, on-record politics don't always have to be coherent to be compelling. And, as serial complainers go, Galarraga's a hard guy to turn away from. As cranked-to-11, motherfuck-a-downstairs-neighbor music, <i>Static</i> works beautifully, and its lean, propulsive 28 minutes seem to fly by in double-time. Throughout <i>Static</i>, Big Ups come across as a band in complete command of their sound, fronted by a guy on the verge of losing it. If Galarraga can learn to better elucidate the ""why?"" and ""what next?"" behind these tantrums of his—to better target his rage without tempering it—Big Ups could really cause some lasting damage. For now, they're doing just fine by punching at the walls.</p></div>"|18887.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18887-big-ups-eighteen-hours-of-static/|7.0|Paul Thompson

He broke through years ago as one of the most promising producers associated with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30517-joey-bada/"">Joey Bada$$</a>'s Pro Era crew, offering potent but catholic updates of beats forged by the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3623-rza/"">RZA</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6478-dj-premier/"">DJ Premier</a>. Since then he has gotten weirder in familiar ways: offering a <a href=""http://leebannon.bandcamp.com/album/never-mind-the-darkness-of-it"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-released EP</a> of TriAngle-style moan-bap and, on his 2012 debut album <i>Fantastic Plastic</i>, stoned West Coast abstractions. <i>Alternate/Endings</i> offers yet another direction, this one inspired by drum and bass, the dark, quick breakbeat music that ruled the UK in the mid and late 90s.</p>
<p>Bannon has expressed a desire to be seen as more than a hip-hop producer, but spiritually the move he makes here isn't large. As a bleak, ever hardening, sample-based music meant to reflect street culture (and often featuring MCs), drum and bass served largely the same role in the UK that hip hop did in the US (though it matured into a club music instead of pop). All of which is to say that the ingredients Bannon works with on <i>Alternate/Endings</i>—breakbeats, samples from old R&amp;B records and movies—are largely the same elements used to create hip-hop beats.</p>
<p>Drum and bass carries no expectation of an MC, though, leaving Bannon as the sole shaper of <i>Alternate/Endings</i>; artistic agency is something that seems important to him. Bannon's history and geography separate <i>Alternate/Endings</i> from the rash of drum and bass revivalism that has swept the UK in the last two years, but also insulates it from the innovations of producers like dBridge, Addison Groove, and Tessela working in the same stylistic sphere. If <i>Alternate/Endings</i> is unique, it's because its sound is retro while its mood remains present and personal.</p>
<p>In an interview with Resident Advisor, Bannon repeatedly namechecks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1752-goldie/"">Goldie</a>, a D&amp;B innovator whose proggy epic, <i>Timeless</i>, stands as a totem of D&amp;B-as-art (as opposed to club music). Bannon's pretensions lie elsewhere—he favors dark, noir-ish breakdowns and seems more interested in atmosphere than rhythm—but he shares Goldie's affinity for capital-a Art. <i>Alternate/Endings</i> functions best as a long piece, allowing its many breaks to dissolve into a slurry of snares and hi-hats, whereupon the album's soiled vocal samples and eerie half-time breakdowns can set the scene.</p>
<p>As such, <i>Alternate/Endings</i> is best when Bannon doesn't go too crazy with the beat science and instead focuses on crafting a mood. Lower-octane tracks such as ""Prime/Decent"" and ""216"" have most in common with Bannon's hip-hop work, and they feel more comfortable than jam-packed scorchers like ""NW/WB"". Bannon stretches his legs on the nine-minute ""Readly/Available"" (like Goldie, Bannon has no use for concision), allowing a flurry of snares to stew in ambient back-alleys and furtive synth riffs. He finds an identity when he blurs the line between drum and bass traditionalism and abstract, mutant hip-hop.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Alternate/Endings</i> is an oddity, a self-contained offering from a restless producer. Bannon cares little about D&amp;B's past or future—only his own—though his flightiness will make you wonder how much he cares about its present. This is a fine diversion, a stylistic workout that Bannon will not feel—and should not feel—any obligation to expand upon. But it also highlights an inconvenient truth, which is that Bannon has proven much better at reinventing himself than he has at reinventing styles. Bannon can call wherever he rests his head home, be it D&amp;B, hip-hop, or elsewhere. <i>Alternate/Endings</i> is tempting, smart, and raw enough to make me wish he'd set up camp somewhere more permanent.</p></div>"|18894.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18894-lee-bannon-alternate-endings/|6.8|Andrew Gaerig

<p>By the time they released it, the Velvets were downplaying the art-world connection (despite the very arty slash in the album's title, and the fact that its black-on-black sleeve was designed by the Factory's Billy Name). Nico was out of the band, although bassist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/649-john-cale/"" target=""_blank"">John Cale</a> would continue to work with her for years. And the album was a relentless, screeching, thudding, scoffing assault on the pop sensibilities of its time: six songs with lyrics designed to horrify the bourgeoisie (not that they'd have listened to the Velvet Underground in the first place), ending with a one-take, two-chord, 17-minute speedfreakout. It clung to the bottom of the album chart for two weeks, disappeared, and went on to become the glorious, tainted fountain from which all scuzz flows.</p>
<p>That's the <i>White Light/White Heat</i> of legend, anyway. For its 45th anniversary—closer to its 46th, but keeping time was never their strong point—it's been reissued in expanded, remastered form, as if what this pinnacle of sloppy noise needed was remastering. As always, the title track, which seems like it should start cold with Cale and Sterling Morrison's backing vocals, sounds like it's had a little trimmed off the top to remove an extraneous sound—although, of course, extraneous sounds are kind of the whole point of this album.</p>
<p>Listening to <i>White Light/White Heat</i> now, it doesn't <i>quite</i> fit the template of its legend. For one thing, Lou Reed's songwriting is often a lot more conventional than it's reputed to be. Strip away the noise and flash and references to illicit drugs and sex, and ""White Light/White Heat"", ""Here She Comes Now"", and ""I Heard Her Call My Name"" are all the sort of simple rock'n'roll readymades that Reed had been cranking out at Pickwick Records a couple of years earlier. (So is ""Guess I'm Falling In Love"", recorded in scorching instrumental form at the <i>White Light </i>sessions, which is practically the same song as the Rutles' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54KBPA20b9Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Must Be In Love""</a>.)</p>
<p>For another, the live disc appended to this edition is a reminder that the Velvet Underground were radical in a totally acceptable way for their time—that, professionally speaking, they were a party band with an audience of hippies, who appeared on bills with the likes of Sly &amp; the Family Stone, Canned Heat, Iron Butterfly, Quicksilver Messenger Service, and Chicago Transit Authority the year <i>White Light/White Heat</i> came out. The performance, apparently from John Cale's collection, was recorded at the Gymnasium in New York in April, 1967 (two of its songs previously appeared on the 1995 <i>Peel Slowly and See</i> box set). It presents the Velvets as a full-on boogie band, whose set is bookended by the instrumental grooves ""Booker T."" and ""The Gift""—turns out they're slightly different songs, contrary to what VU fans have assumed for the past few decades. The rest of the gig includes what might or might not have been the first public performance of ""Sister Ray"" (it was still a very new song, at any rate), and one legit addition to the canon: ""I'm Not a Young Man Anymore"", a chugging electric blues that wouldn't have been out of place in Creedence Clearwater Revival's early repertoire.</p>
<p>So once this mysterious black-on-black artifact is demystified, what's left of it? More mystery, it turns out. What possessed Cale to start playing an out-of-time, two-note bass part louder than anything else at the end of ""White Light/White Heat"", and how could he have guessed that that was a great idea? Was the famous split-second pause before Reed's splatterbomb solo on ""I Heard Her Call My Name"" intentional? What the fuck was up with Reed filling in words—""SWEETLY!""—in the middle of Cale's vocal on ""Lady Godiva's Operation"", and why is it still hilarious? Speaking of that song, might lyrics about a delicate hypersexual creature interacting with ""another curly-headed boy,"" directly followed by a medical horror-show, have anything to do with a curly-headed songwriter who was given electroconvulsive therapy to ""cure"" his bisexuality as a teenager? Why is ""Sister Ray"" way, <i>way</i> more potent than any other extended jam on a simple riff by an American band of the 60s?</p>
<p>It's surprising to hear anything besides the universe catching its breath after ""Sister Ray"" ends, but the first disc of this reissue is filled out with other previously released evidence of John Cale's final months in the Velvet Underground: the instrumental ""Guess I'm Falling In Love"", both versions of the electric-viola showcase ""Hey Mr. Rain"", and the band's thoroughly charming stab at making a commercially viable single, ""Temptation Inside Your Heart""/""Stephanie Says"". There's also a previously unheard alternate take of ""I Heard Her Call My Name"" (not quite as good as the official one, and mostly interesting to hear which of Reed's apparent ad-libs weren't), and one fascinating curio: an early version of ""Beginning to See the Light"", recorded at the ""Temptation Inside Your Heart"" session. By the time the song appeared on <i>The Velvet Underground</i> in 1969, it had become lither and wittier, and Reed had sharpened a few of its lyrics; this broad-shouldered, clomping version is distinctly not there yet, but everything the Velvets released on their official albums is so canonical that it's strange and heartening to realize that their songs didn't just spring into existence already perfect.</p></div>"|18770.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18770-the-velvet-underground-white-lightwhite-heat/|10.0|Douglas Wolk

Sometimes all you need is one memorable line that lends meaning to the gibberish that surrounds it. Tanner Jones of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31918-you-blew-it/"" target=""_blank"">You Blew It!</a> excels at this kind of songwriting. Take “Match &amp; Tinder”, the first song from the Orlando emo band’s sophomore LP, <i>Keep Doing What You’re Doing. </i>At one point, Jones sings, “I’ll struggle to put your shoes over mine in my head and use it to piece together my confidence.” Immediately after that sentence, he adds this equally inscrutable grab-bag of nouns and verbs: “I can hardly breathe, so I’m scanning for space that lends asymmetry where I’ll put mind over matter to put this matter out of my mind.” Now, I’ve played “Match &amp; Tinder” many, many times, because it has an addictively chunky riff and pleasurably hyperactive drumming and therefore is an excellent example of sensitive-dude melodic punk rock. But I never notice the aforementioned vocab casseroles when I’m listening. Because “Match &amp; Tinder” (and the entirety of <i>Keep Doing What You’re Doing</i>) really boils down to the last line, which is kind of brilliant: “I’m having trouble trying to find the right way to say I feel less than confident.”</p>
<p><i>Keep Doing What You’re Doing </i>is an “airing of grievances” record—Jones constantly directs his ire at an unnamed somebody who has somehow disappointed him, whether it’s the person with “habits” in “Regional Dialect” or the cretin who has given Jones “the displeasure of enduring your lack of manners” in “Rock Springs”. But the way he delivers these indignities—in a pained, shaky howl that’s constantly fighting to stay above the din of YBI!’s wondrously ringing guitars—is indicative of a guy who’s projecting his displeasure at himself onto others. Even when Jones is pointing the finger, he always sounds like the most vulnerable guy in the room. You know, typical emo stuff.</p>
<p>Since forming in 2009, You Blew It! have survived various lineup changes by zeroing in on the tenets of their genre like a religion. The group is not shy about proclaiming its influences—its Topshelf Records bio <a href=""http://www.topshelfrecords.com/artists/you-blew-it"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">directly references</a> emo O.G.s Cap’n Jazz and 00s torch-bearers Algernon Cadwallader, and says “YBI! cherrypicks from 90s emo and indie.” That’s exactly what YBI! did on its 2012 full-length debut <i>Grow Up, Dude, </i>where the band’s fat hooks were submerged (and occasionally torpedoed) by booming, fumbling production. If you’re 35 and grew up on <i>Nothing Feels Good </i>and <i>LP2</i>, <i>Grow Up, Dude </i>will make you feel 15 again. But it will also make you feel like you’re 15 if you’re actually 15. This is the difference between “retro” and “timeless”: Emo will remain eternally relevant because people of a certain age will always have trouble trying to find the right way to say I feel less than confident.</p>
<p>What sets <i>Keep Doing </i>apart from <i>Dude </i>is that, musically speaking, YBI! have grown in self-assurance by leaps and bounds. With the production assistance of scene stalwart Evan Weiss (who also plays bass on the record), You Blew It! have fashioned <i>Keep Doing </i>into a deeply satisfying, full-bodied, big-tent rock record. There are four credited guitarists in the liner notes, and it sounds like each of them contributed at least one guitar track to every song. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16411-award-of-the-year-award/"" target=""_blank"">“Award of the Year Award”</a> is a perfectly spat gob of romantic petulance—Jones’ one killer line is “You can always consider me a friend, just strictly in the past tense”—set to over-amped power pop. The ballad “’Strong Island” opens with nearly 30 seconds of beautifully strummed power chords that usher in the bass-driven verse like a fanfare. By the closing number “Better to Best”, YBI! is in full-on anthem mode, with a triumphant chorus of ""whoa""’s pushing <i>Keep Doing </i>toward the majestic grandiosity of arena rock.  </p>
<p>The bugaboo among some of the scenesters that form the core of YBI!’s audience is that the band has been positioned in the music press as a leading proponent of the so-called “emo revival.” Those that have been paying attention all along understandably bristle at the revival talk. So let’s set that bothersome word aside: What’s really happening is an emo reclamation by a segment of the rock audience that bailed on the genre 10 or so years ago. </p>
<p>For a while, the itch for shouty, earnest guitar music was scratched by records like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14010-the-monitor/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Monitor </i></a>and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16564-japandroids-celebration-rock/"" target=""_blank"">Celebration Rock</a>, </i>collections that were considered MOR indie, but would perhaps be marginalized in 2014, just as countless other punk and emo records from the past decade have been relegated to the corner. Now, a band like You Blew It! are poised to fill the role for frustrated listeners who can’t find loud, angsty rock'n'roll via traditional indie channels anymore. If this is the music that speaks to you, here is where the action now is. So, forget the emo revival—this is about two subsets of rock fans being pushed together by aspirational emo bands reaching beyond their niche on one side and the eclipse of traditional indie by mainstream pop on the other. <i>Keep Doing What You’re Doing </i>marks the precise point where these audiences meet, get drunk, and turn it up.</p></div>"|18891.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18891-you-blew-it-keep-doing-what-youre-doing/|7.6|Steven Hyden

Radric Davis II: The Caged Bird Sings</i>—nominally the sequel to his 2009 Warner Bros. LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13793-the-burrprint-the-movie-3-d-the-state-vs-radric-davis/"" target=""_blank""><i>The State Vs. Radric Davis</i></a>—is that the stakes are lower. The spotlight on Gucci’s music is also dimmer, thanks to <a href=""http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/09/gucci-mane-apologizes-behavior-lean-destroyed-heading-rehab-addiction/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a turbulent year</a> in the trap icon’s personal life; currently, he <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/03/showbiz/gucci-mane-federal-weapons-charges/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">awaits trial</a> for a gun charge that carries a sentence of up to 20 years. Despite how much happened to Gucci in 2013—he still managed to put out a dozen releases and played the villain in Harmony Korine’s <i>Spring Breakers</i>—you get the sense that no one is expecting much from <i>The Caged Bird Sings</i>, a release that Gucci’s camp plopped on <a href=""http://guccimane1017bricksquad.bandcamp.com/album/the-state-vs-radric-davis-the-caged-bird-sings"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bandcamp</a> on Christmas Day. For what it’s worth, Gucci delivers something that easily clears the exceedingly low expectations.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Despite the implications the LP’s name might carry, Gucci’s not chasing the pop rap instincts he was on the hit-or-miss <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13793-the-burrprint-the-movie-3-d-the-state-vs-radric-davis/""><i>The State Vs. Radric Davis</i></a>, which included his highest-charting hit “Wasted” and “Lemonade”. Here, a producer with a hitmaking pedigree like Bangledesh is nowhere to be found; Instead, Gucci gets ample assists from his usual Brick Squad brethren <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"" target=""_blank"">Young Thug</a>, Peewee Longway, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31028-young-scooter/"" target=""_blank"">Young Scooter</a> as well as production from 808 Mafia and Zaytoven (who Gucci is <a href=""http://www.ajc.com/news/news/crime-law/gucci-mane-sues-waka-flocka-flame-wakas-mom/nbxsy/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">currently suing</a>). <i>The Caged Bird Sings</i> hems something closer to a release like <i>Trap House 3</i>, a workmanlike release with more than a few flickers of life but none of the experimentation Gucci has flirted with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lvriLg9LH4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in the recent past</a>. Though songs like “Birdman” and “Jackie Chan” contain plenty of Gucci’s marble-mouthed platitudes, it feels generic to the point that not even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"">Migos</a> can reenergize the proceedings (I’d compare it to taking a Five Hour Energy after being awake for 48 hours; too little, too late). In a career where Gucci Mane has covered the same ground, repaving it over and over again, <i>The Caged Bird Sings</i> feels particularly recycled.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But that’s not to say there aren’t a few moments that will keep his audience happy. The fists-flying knock of “Feets” or the uptempo burst “Any Thing”, which features a staccato verse fast-rising Gucci protege Young Thug, serve as good examples of when <i>The Caged Bird</i> heats up. And while the quality of the album's sound suggests more organization and deliberation than what’s usually found on the other end of a download link, it’s difficult to argue that people will remember it. Given his onslaught of just-as-good-if-not-better free material in 2013, I have a harder time imagining that people will be paying for it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But then again, 2013 is a year that Gucci Mane might rather forget. With Twitter beefs that spiraled into full-on lawsuits and the drama just continuing to pile it’s hard to know when Gucci might be in his zone again. (Throughout, you get the sense that he’s pretty out of it; he doesn’t even say “BRR!” once!). <i>The Caged Bird Sings</i> isn’t bad; it’s just lifeless.</p></div>"|18847.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18847-gucci-mane-the-state-vs-rodric-davis-the-caged-bird-sings/|5.6|Corban Goble

Conceived as a bawdy, voiceless take on Detroit techno and New York electro, it was introduced in the middle of the last decade to provide an outlet for Dear's baser desires, namely depictions of raunchy sex and electronic music freed from the need to sound artful or smart. <i>Audion X</i>, offered up 10 years after the release of Audion's sole album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/488-suckfish/""><i>Suckfish</i></a>, collects 18 tracks from Audion's dozen-plus EPs and that album, and adds two new tracks in anticipation of a sophomore LP, due later this year. Even-numbered anniversaries aside, it's a peculiar reclamation, as Audion records are not particularly influential or coveted. Neither is its style—full-bodied machine funk—resurgent at the moment.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Dear's work as Audion stood out upon release in opposition to his work under his own name. Early albums <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2526-leave-luck-to-heaven/""><i>Leave Luck to Heaven</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10289-asa-breed/""><i>Asa Breed</i></a> established Dear as a wunderkind of the micro-house style—an understated, minimal take on techno famously championed by Cologne's Kompakt label. Dear has since proven himself something of a stylistic chameleon, eventually gravitating towards a celebrated electro-pop sound. He delivered some of his most compelling vocal work just last year as a foil to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1201-dj-koze/"">DJ Koze</a>, his ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16369-magical-boy-matthew-herbert-remix/"">magical boy</a>."" Back in 2004, though, Audion was everything Matthew Dear was not: explicit, stoopid, forward. Extended club cuts such as ""Mouth to Mouth"" and ""The Pong"" offered Dear a connection to the seminal Detroit techno sound (Dear spent part of his youth in Michigan) as well as to the rowdy electro on offer from tastemakers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4236-tiga/"">Tiga</a> and DJ Hell.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">As Audion tracks are largely wordless mazes of rhythmic curlicues and farty bass noises, they earn the debauchery largely through their song titles. Titles like ""Just Fucking"" and ""Your Place or Mine"" feature. The sexiness might mean more to Dear than it does to us: his early work was nuanced and elegant to the point that you can imagine him producing a romping track like ""Titty Fuck"" and finding it sufficiently naughty so as to name it something like, well, ""Titty Fuck"". Audion tracks aren't really about sex, or at least they're no more about sex than lots of other funky machine music. That's okay: sometimes foreplay is wine and movie, sometimes it's sweating next to someone until 4am.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At present, Audion's sound is completely out of step with techno's prevailing trends, which favor harsh, industrial noise and dubby deconstructions. Audion tracks slave themselves to the groove: you won't remember specific drum patterns, and the hooks are short and repetitive so as to inspire maximum grinding. The tracks <i>feel</i> big. When ""It's Full of Blinding Light"" is careening around the room, you're not supposed to think of sound structure or art or music culture: you're supposed to wiggle. Tracks like ""Mouth to Mouth"" and ""The Pong"" are excellent reminders of techno's debt to funk and its unwavering commitment to any riff, bassline, or hook that inspires movement. At its best, Audion offers a rowdier take on the Kompakt/minimal techno sound that ruled the aughts. It's a beefier, fleshier mix, not as slinky as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4505-ricardo-villalobos/"" target=""_blank"">Ricardo Villalobos</a> or as wily as DJ Koze, but brasher, harder, and dumber (by design).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Despite a fetching sound and some killer tracks, <i>Audion X</i> doesn't have much of a story to tell, not even one of artistic progression. Banging, erotic club tracks are Audion's singular purpose, and <i>Audion X</i> offers 18 of them, spanning nearly two-and-a-half hours. Spacey, atmospheric excursions like ""I Am the Car"" can span nearly 10 minutes. Most of the offerings are uniform in tempo, mood, and function. And while <i>Audion X</i> will leave no Audion fan wanting, a bevy of potent remixes were largely ignored. <i>Audion X</i> seems timed to rekindle interest in the Audion project prior to a new album, so it's worth nothing that the two new tracks here—""Motormouth"" and ""Sky""—are excellent. The former, in particular, dices a vocal sample into a mental, infectious mess.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still, if the purpose of <i>Audion X</i> was to drum up interest, it may have the opposite effect. <i>Audion X</i> is all the Audion anyone will ever need—twice as much, actually. Dear's work as Audion was limited by design, and <i>Audion X</i> repeatedly shoves those limits into your face. <i>Audion X</i> is a stylistic indulgence, for both its creator and its listeners.</p></div>"|18899.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18899-audion-audion-x/|7.1|Andrew Gaerig

Within the electronic community, nobody generated fiercer debate on the subject than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31916-nina-kraviz/"" target=""_blank"">Nina Kraviz</a>. Operating in a field notoriously given to self-promotion, her tenacity in utilising an obvious USP as a marketable strategy rankled with some. (A now infamous clip in an otherwise self-serious documentary from last March invited heightened opprobrium from all corners.) She also gets flack for an alleged lack of technical finesse behind the decks, but Kraviz has been unafraid to address her critics head on, something that further solidifies her position as a lightning rod for discourse. The resulting publicity works as a natural propellant, of course, but it's overshadowed her output.</p>
<p>Which is maybe unfair: there's a tangible human quality that bleeds through her recorded material and her spirited deep cut sets. From her breakout on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blr7G9auiPA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DJ Jus-Ed's ""Voices""</a> in 2009 through to 2012's self-titled debut and collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/195-apparat/"" target=""_blank"">Apparat</a> and Efdemin, she's keenly played into the assumed role as a Siberian siren, infusing frigid house productions with sultry vocal lines.<i> Nina Kraviz</i> was a solid record that found success in deviations from that twilit formula: both low-bouncing ""Ghetto Kraviz"" and Marcellus Pittmann's edit of ""Working""'s snookerball-clacking beat wound up underground hits, while showstopping finale ""Fire"" positioned Kraviz's haunting double-tracked voice in suspension, a picture of perfect stillness. The close-mic'd whispers and fuggy ambiance were hardly revolutionary, but they displayed a great deal more character than <i>Mr. Jones</i>, her first material in 18 months, a largely charmless double EP that would struggle to justify half its 54 minute runtime. </p>
<p>The execution's fine, it's the ideas themselves that are at fault. Bluntly, <i>Mr. Jones</i> does little of note and takes an awfully long time doing it. As standalone tracks, the majority lack a creative spark—they're repetitive slabs of meandering, boilerplate tech house. While Kraviz's international touring schedule has been extensive, <i>Mr. Jones</i>' lack of ingenuity can't be chalked up to a draining regime given that four of the six cuts are minor cosmetic touch-ups of tracks rooted in a period around a half decade back. Opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16404-nina-kraviz-desire/"" target=""_blank"">""Desire""</a> is of the better tracks, but it has an inescapably monochromatic and workmanlike feel. The repeated mantra and carnal moans feel sterile, as if pumped through a tannoy system, sitting atop an unobtrusive rhythmic chug of pistons and gears, and the sound of two cinderblocks shifting in unison, advancing with no resolve, pushing bodies to the grind. It would make a decent bridge on the dancefloor, but a five-minute mixing tail with no real shift-up exposes a lack of substance between the scaffolding. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Kraviz invests renewed faith in her voice as a load-bearing pillar rather than mere atmospheric accoutrement, but having emerged from behind the smokescreen it appears the lustre has faded from her eyes. ""Remember"", the other new number alongside ""Desire"", brings Detroit native Luke Hess on board for some double-barrel techno pummel and hackneyed B-movie dialogue. Spinning a spoken-word tale across the title track, she's present but featureless, shooting for coldwave detachment but landing closer to monotony. Things aren't helped by the simplistic bassline and lack of tension: the components lie neatly next to one another with zero dynamic interplay, so when Nina's voice rolls back after an extended build, any chance of release evaporates. The<i> </i>""2008 Home Listening Mix""—packaged with three other alternate versions on the digital version—is a lot better, wiping the grey vaseline smear off the mix and letting the beat and chirruping effects fill space properly. The same problem shows up on the nondescript pair of songs padding the end of the EP. These tracks utilise similar tools—sparse claps, mild hiss, vague menace, head-on-desk thud—to little effect.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A welcome exception comes in the form of ""Black White"", a track exploring different terrain with an Afro-Caribbean lilt. The wooden timbres and looser rhythm provide a marked switch-up as the song ramps in intensity before breaking into a groove redolent of the kind of funky house prevalent during its initial inception. Kraviz's restrained yelps find their way through the dark, working as a tidy accompaniment to the guitar notes bobbing through the hypnotic final third and petite melody set in amongst the chinking percussion. It proves a lone takeaway on an overlong and underdeveloped release.</p></div>"|18832.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18832-nina-kraviz-nina-kravitz/|4.5|Gabriel Szatan

It's an ailment that grounded one of the most vibrant stage presences in R&amp;B, and it seemed like a cruel rebuttal to a career built on long-due good fortune and a spirit that took on and beat all comers. That she intends to tour again soon after her recent final chemo treatment is a good omen, and with luck the disease will be just a footnote to a long career. The other story of note is the cameo Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings had in Martin Scorsese's <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i>: there they are, the singer and her group, standing onstage in the role of a wedding band playing James Bond supervillain torch song “Goldfinger” at the reception of a Caligula-minded stockbroker. A movie where a 21st century band plays 1960s music in a scene set in the early 90s—that's the context they found themselves in, and there are few better ways to show off just how unindebted to time they are.</p>
<p>Placing Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings at a certain space in time seems easy aesthetically; few bands' version of 1968 have lasted as long or as effectively as theirs. With a virtuoso versatility that all parties involved have cultivated, it wouldn't be a huge shock—much less a disappointment—if they deigned to cross that Nixon-era threshold and fool around with some “Blow Your Head”/“Funky Worm” synthesizers or put a little B.T. Express-style proto-disco hustle in their backbone. But even if the title of <i>Give the People What They Want </i>invokes one of the more state-of-the-art slices of 70s soul as delivered by the O'Jays, Jones and company stay in their more vintage lane. They might be a bit tighter than they were on 2002's <i>Dap-Dippin'</i>..., and they cut a bit more cleanly through their old-school analogue recording methods, but this is an album built less on advancement than resilience.</p>
<p>And this is an album with plenty of the latter. It isn't a sound anyone should take for granted, since it's been well-established that the blue-flame intensity of Jones' voice and the Dap-Kings' evocative arrangements aren't exactly common stock and would legitimately bring down the house anywhere from Coachella to Wattstax. Both singer and band have gotten so versed in their mixture of classic Southern soul and occasional flourishes of Motown or Philly soul opulence—transitions they make with a masterful smoothness—that even a first listen will make a song feel lived-in, with an “always been there” familiarity that hasn't yet gone threadbare. Even the cover art is a direct nod of a throwback—a more ornate riff on the sleeve of the Chi-Lites' 1971 LP <i>(For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People</i>.</p>
<p>That lets slip another commonality of theirs with vintage R&amp;B—the idea of soul as a vehicle for social commentary. The fun irony of Jones and the Dap-Kings playing the on-screen Jordan Belfort's wedding is that their songs' sense of grievance, justice, and populist power has rarely felt stronger. Opener “Retreat!”, with its martial-march tweak of the Holland-Dozier-Holland that gave us “I Hear a Symphony”, is a massive kiss-off to some arrogant somebody-or-other that can't help but crumble in the face of “a woman scorned”—though any lingering spite is drowned out by the sheer joy of Jones expressing the strength needed to overcome someone else's misdeeds. “People Don't Get What They Deserve” is that rare dose of idealism-deflating reality that doesn't drown in its own bitter cynicism; Jones' sprint-paced rapport with the backup singer Dapettes doesn't sound jaded and world-weary enough, and right on to that. And “We Get Along” holds the prescription to endure—help and relief might be a long time coming, but being able to keep on doing it in the face of strife is a source of inner strength in the meantime. It's implicit gospel that puts its faith in the people.</p>
<p><i>Give the People What They Want</i> is a pretty short 10 songs, though its breezy half-hour leaves plenty that sticks and plenty more worth revisiting when it doesn't. The collection's balance of rousing barn-burners and slower, sweeter break-up/make-up ballads (like the sun-streaked bliss of “Slow Down, Love”) keeps it moving. And it's all briskly impassioned enough to make most skeptics brush off the old “have I heard this before?” questions, even if this is one of the more get-what-you-expect albums of the early year.

In the time since <i>Relax </i>hit stores in September of 2011, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30151-kool-ad/"">Kool A.D.</a> has released something along the lines of five solo mixtapes and a full-length collaboration with rapper/producer Kass (Peaceful Solutions); the amount of material he’s made even in the year since Das Racist called it quits tops the total output of his previous gig. And that’s in addition to publishing a zine (Joke Book), starting a novel, and serving as the drummer for a hardcore band (Party Animal). But while Victor Vazquez has moved on from Das Racist, the Kool A.D. persona hasn’t really budged at all, essentially the same role that served as a foil to the more aggressive and quintessentially “New York” Heems—just as stoned, brainy, and incensed, but more pacifist and Pacific Coast in demeanor. It’s a style that’s proven to be quite adaptable as he’s staked out a solo career, whether on the left-field R&amp;B of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16199-heems-nehru-jackets-kool-ad-the-palm-wine-drinkard/""><i>Palm Wine Drinkard </i></a>or his Bay Area homecoming detailed on the “bus route” trilogy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16552-kool-ad-51/""><i>51</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17750-kool-ad-19-63/""><i>19, </i>and <i>63</i></a>. Kool A.D.’s Twitter feed-of-consciousness style may be an acquired taste, but it seems to pair well.</p>
<p>Despite being a collection of outtakes from his upcoming proper album <i>Word O.K.</i>, <i>Not O.K.</i> features the kind of roster that makes it feel like the biggest event of his post-DR career—in terms of both production and guest rappers, it spans the widest range of relative unknowns and relatively bigger names, including frequent collaborator Amaze 88, Stones Throw mainstay <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3211-oh-no"">Oh No</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi"">Toro Y Moi</a>, who produces “Fettuccine”. The most notable additions pop up on “CNN,” where Kool A.D. enlists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1200-del-tha-funkee-homosapien"">Del Tha Funkee Homosapien</a> and Ladybug Mecca from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29141-digable-planets"">Digable Planets</a>, rappers who represent the geographic duality within Kool A.D.—Bay Area loopiness with an off-kilter, playfully subversive NYC sensibility. “CNN” serves not as a cosign between the three MC’s involved, but rather a pledge of allegiance: they all had brief, seemingly accidental moments as an alt-type in the commercial spotlight before spending the rest of their career working the margins (with the exception of Del’s appearances in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1767-gorillaz"">Gorillaz</a>) to the approval of their fans.</p>
<p>Which is a roundabout way of saying that a presumable collection of outtakes can’t be seen as “for the diehards” any more than <i>51</i> or <i>Palm Wine Drinkard</i>; it’s all been for the diehards. If you’ve engaged with Kool A.D.’s solo work in any meaningful way, you’ve heard him do pretty much everything he does on <i>Not O.K</i>. Repurposed lyrics from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1791-purple-haze""><i>Purple Haze</i></a> deep cuts? Yup. References to his <i>own</i> lyrics, along with acknowledgements that he is referencing his own lyrics? Those too. The familiarity cuts against even the ostensible “surprising” bits—brainwashing repetition in stoned raps about being stoned (“Exotic”), brainwashing repetition in near-hyphy dance tracks (“Trippy Gurl”), the gutsy intrusion of French MC B.E. Lebeau, “Psychotropical” spending two minutes playing itself backwards, oh, and plenty of subliminal shout outs to<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/""> Lil B</a>, whether ad-libbing “computer” at random continuously throughout “Insane Computer Raps” or being the first MC to acknowledge the influence of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhXhVMKxnkY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Andy Milonakis rapping like he’s Lil B</a> on “Tiger Style”.</p>
<p>Of course, Kool A.D. is such a singular, shrugging presence that all of the aforementioned ends up being fairly cohesive. Yeah, the, post-modern, topical omnivorousness of his lyrics makes “Twitter rapper” an easy hook for Kool A.D., though it’s no less true: The utter lack of affectation in his rapping means that hearing his rhymes is equivalent to reading them in real time. The Camp Lo quotes are seemingly given the same amount of space and import as a socially trenchant line about being “in Glasgow buying weed from Indian fans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1482-50-cent"">50 Cent</a>” or a commentary on how his peers “cry over spilled milk and argue about whether leather kilts are hetero.” On “Pass the Milk”, he’s barely rapping at all and it results in his most potent lyrical deconstructions: “I feel like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Leonard Cohen</a>/ and I don't even know if I can name a Leonard Cohen track/ is Leonard Cohen wack?/ That’s rhetorical you don’t need to answer that.” He ends his verse claiming “fuck the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a>, go Yoko,” which gets at the questions of how serious you’re meant to take all of this: is he aligning himself with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3161-yoko-ono"">Yoko Ono</a> because of the racial and gender undertones inherent in her dismissal by casual rock historians? Or is he saying the Beatles suck for the reasons most people do, i.e., just to be a jerk?</p>
<p>By the same token, you’ve heard this all before. This deep in, if Kool A.D. is missing anything crucial from the Das Racist dynamic, it’s a sense of stakes in his music, a hint that he’s headed somewhere or challenging himself. Or maybe he just needs someone rude enough to offer resistance. Though limitless in its reach, Kool A.D. uses his worldliness and wordiness as a reason to deconstruct language and burrow even more deeply into himself. It’s unclear whether he means it as a boast or self-deprecation, but when he lays out a plan to “ouroboros my own lexicon,” it’s a fair description of <i>Not O.K.</i> itself, a fancier, outre way to say the same thing.</p></div>"|18884.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18884-kool-ad-not-ok/|6.6|Ian Cohen

Though, others shouldn’t worry about what the title implies: the four songs on the EP are sung entirely in English. They were, however, originally recorded in Swedish, found across a pair of Morén solo albums from his home country, released outside his main gig singing and playing guitar in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4966-peter-bjorn-and-john"" target=""_blank"">Peter Bjorn &amp; John</a>. 2010's <i>I spåren av tåren</i> and 2012's <i>Pyramiden</i> sound good: loud, soul-pop departures from the fingerpicked folk on his loosely conceptual debut solo album, <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11337-the-last-tycoon/""><i>The Last Tycoon</i></a>. If you happened to pick up those Swedish-language albums, the music on <i>Broken Swenglish</i> is nearly identical to them, but the lyrics have shifted a bit. The words aren't necessarily direct translations, but expansions and interpretations stemming from the comfort of writing in his first language.</p>
<p>Morén has said in interviews that he feels more at ease with Swedish lyrics, that writing in English comes with too much pressure. It's an admirable admission that also highlights the cracks in Morén's work. Leaving the acoustic fare behind, he shifts back to power pop songcraft, properly constructed, and sticky with hooks. A bemused, almost cynical melancholy settles over the album, though it doesn’t quite dance with the same kind of jangly magic like, say, the Go-Betweens’ or the Zombies. But Morén plays to that same kind of internal bounce—an energy that never leaves the songs too limp. There’s an ode to inertia, cheekily titled “Going Places” where his voice adopts an edge that thankfully overpowers that Brit-pop reverb he's been using since the first PB&amp;J album. It helps push the song along to its end, where we once again are met with his whistle (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIRE6iw-ws4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">you know the one</a>), though here it's strident, dissonant, and not-s0 radio-friendly.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Little moments on the album do peer above the mundane, like the waltzing “To Catch Up With You”. It’s a lilting tune that mimics strolling in and out of cafes and down wet, cobblestone streets. Just be careful of this landmine the middle: ""The pressure of lasting a lifetime is too hard for anyone to take/ I wouldn't want you to fake your innermost longings"" because it may rip you right out of the daydream. In the past there’s been some some gems and clunkers in Morén's lyrics, and while there’s no big winces here, there’s nothing that digs into the heart either. ""Constant Reaction"" is a driving socio-political Pulp homage that's too cluttered to make you think, and ""Say My Name"" is just too neutral and static to make you feel.</p>
<p>And there you have it. At four songs and 12 minutes, and with no “new” songs really, Morén appears to be testing the waters to see how these adaptations will play to a wider, English-speaking audience. The real fun would be to see how the lyrics shifted, but with only a dubious Google Translator at my side, it's hardly something I could comment on. It seems that his Swedish tongue might be more silver than is English. For instance, the Swedish version of ""Going Places"" is titled ""Erik M. Nilsson"" after a little-known Swedish filmmaker, whose name is absent from the remake. It's a good example of the kind of alluring specificity that's absent from <i>Broken Swenglish, </i>which is ultimately a reminder of what the idiom isn't: <i>found</i> in translation.</p></div>"|18846.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18846-peter-moren-broken-swenglish-vol-1-ep/|5.8|Jeremy D.

The songs collected on this retrospective are almost totally of a piece: singer/drummer Tali White's tremulous-lad tenor (with its undisguised Australian accent) and pitty-pat percussion; chief songwriter Marty Donald's clear, clean guitar tone; and wry lyrics about various shades of emotional ache, featuring the kind of wordplay that tends to come from people who can both define ""zeugma"" and provide an example (""I can't see the florist for the flowers/ And I can't see the point in hanging 'round."") On a first approximation, ""Jewel Thieves"" is the only one of the 35 songs here that's not about frail male heteroromantic yearning or musing on surroundings or both.</p>
<p>The Lucksmiths were, in other words, the exemplars of a certain kind of deliberately anti-macho indie-pop, and they made no secret of which bands they hearted most: the like-minded, much more short-lived, mostly British acts that had been connected to Sarah Records and the C86 scene. Their fan base was fanatical; their formula was durable. And their Indie 4Eva attitude was largely untempered by their models' and contemporaries' exploration outside their perfumed garden. There's very little on <i>Cartography for Beginners</i> that branches out like the Housemartins' stabs at a cappella gospel, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"" target=""_blank"">Belle and Sebastian</a>'s salutes to Northern soul, or Trembling Blue Stars' bleak eroticism; the horn section on ""The Golden Age of Aviation"" can trace its lineage to New Orleans only by way of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"" target=""_blank"">the Cure</a>'s ""Close to Me"".</p>
<p>They were cloistered, but they were devout. The Lucksmiths' kind of artistic evolution meant a slow, steady improvement in craft—suppler melodies, slyer puns, more carefully wrought observations—so this is the rare decade-plus retrospective where the later songs beat the early ones. (The addition of second guitarist Louis Richter for their last few albums helped a lot, too.) They broke up amicably enough that they played a farewell tour and recorded a farewell single that's close to a career peak (""Get-to-Bed Birds"", the gentlest of valedictions, about staying up too late on New Year's Eve); 3/4 of them went on to start a new band, Last Leaves, together.</p>
<p>All of which is good news, and any first-rank Lucksmiths song is a delightful addition to a mix tape. (Cassette tape, please. This is a band that recorded a song called ""The Cassingle Revival"" in all seriousness, or as close as a perpetually self-ironizing band could get to all seriousness.) But two straight hours of this stuff can get <i>maddening</i>. Hearing White croon couplets like ""I went a fortnight without email/ Then a postcard scant of detail"" is splendid in the context of other kinds of songs—a badges-and-anoraks corrective to polished bravado, heavy beats, real and fake American accents. Then he rhymes ""Pacific"" with ""heliolithic,"" quips ""don't let the barstools get you down,"" remarks ""she's all heart but I'm all thumbs""—and eventually it starts sounding uncomfortably like what they love most isn't the romantic partners for whom they perpetually claim they're longing, or the fisherman's-knot melodies they were constantly refining, but their own cleverness and purity of purpose.</p></div>"|18842.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18842-the-lucksmiths-cartography-for-beginners-a-best-of-the-lucksmiths/|7.4|Douglas Wolk

Dropped on Christmas day, it's a gift for true fans, but casual onlookers will likely be disappointed that Fab's strong suits—memorable punchlines, rap radio standouts and charismatic tough talk—are less evident this time around.<br/><br/>Like the whole of Fab's career, the <i>Soul</i> series could best be described as satisfying, and now with <i>3</i>, you can now cut-and-paste together a pretty excellent mixtape from the choicest bits of all three. Though <a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Fabolous-The-Soul-Tape-2-mixtape.409614.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>2</i></a> remains the high-water mark of the series, <i>3</i> continues on in traditions that made the project interesting in the first place, and largely avoids caving to the whims of the current marketplace's taste.

Here, Fabolous kicks things off by doing his best with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ7eJm5bZ5Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drake's ""Paris Morton Music 2""</a> (""Everything Was the Same"") and closes things out with the inspired idea of rapping over the euphoric break in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnrLXDYnS6c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kanye's ""On Sight""</a> (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsnJdmSHO_g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Holy Name of Mary Choral Family's ""He'll Give Us What We Really Need""</a>). But as with the previous <i>Soul Tape</i>s, Fabolous is clearly more interested in presenting all he has to offer, making for a varied but uneven listen.<br/><br/>Despite the constant recycling of the struggle-hustle-succeed-repeat formula, the original material on <i>Soul Tape 3</i> often hits the mark. The tape gets its first authentic ""WHOOO!"" moment on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qngkpxJpGqw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Hope""</a>, with a colossal beat from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29765-araabmuzik/"" target=""_blank"">Araabmuzik</a> and a guest verse from an alert <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8872-jadakiss/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Jadakiss</a> (""Your life's worth nothing, the goons had it appraised""), and follows up strong with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s6pGDe3SXI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Know""</a>, featuring the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53511-young-jeezy-arrested-on-charges-of-battery-false-imprisonment-and-terroristic-threats-against-son/"" target=""_blank"">currently embattled (Young) Jeezy</a>, finally offering a solid hook (something the trilogy hasn't been known for). The tape's biggest talking point, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-ITpIWJGMI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Get Back""</a>, comes courtesy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>'s titanic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaMreUKk5Fk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Control"" verse</a> (<a href=""http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717346/trinidad-james-atlanta-runs-new-york.jhtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">and, to a lesser extent, Trinidad James</a>), but smartly avoids trying to hastily capitalize on the vitriol. While others scrambled to the booth, Fab has wisely let a cooler head prevail, offering a measured but firm stance on King of New York politicking. ""Whenever you ven aqui to that mighty NYC/ We gon' check that name you claim, bring your [an inserted sample of Kendrick's 'YAWK' ad-lib] and ID.""<br/><br/>Had the rest of <i>The Soul Tape 3</i> been merely mediocre, a lot of the aforementioned material might have really popped, but instead it's nearly all but drowned out thanks to generic MMG bluster (""Foreigners""), charmless Autotuned warbling (""Playa"") and a trio of painfully dull loverman joints (one is called ""Situationships"") that round out the tape. For a guy who's made a name for himself as a for-the-ladies specialist, the tracks have a particularly deadening effect, especially in light of the highly entertaining <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po1AHRF_Gi4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cuffin' Season""</a>. It's been a long held belief that Fabolous' mixtapes are always much stronger than his official releases, and there's some truth to that, despite the fact that <i>The Soul Tape 3</i> isn't the strongest piece of evidence. But with the kinda-awesome <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLCOTa6rnlI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2 Chainz-assisted ""When I Feel Like It""</a> that's supposed to appear on the long-delayed <i>Loso's Way 2:</i> <i>Rise to Power </i>feeling like a good omen for the LP, who knows? Trying be everything to everyone has often prevented Fab from being truly great, but it goes to show how that, a good deal of the time, the approach can often yield more than a few real gems.</p></div>"|18885.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18885-fabolous-the-soul-tape-3/|6.2|Zach Kelly

This is in part an aesthetic choice, but the paring down of each track is a means to an end: the duo’s instant classic debut <i>Settle</i> doesn't sacrifice emotional resonance in the name of efficiency, and it’s in that tension—the weight carried by bare bones—that the album becomes special.</p>
<p>Though unfussy, this formula makes for songs that might very well be difficult—if not intimidating—to remix. How do you chip away at and then rebuild tracks so...just so? Well, <i>Settle: The Remixes</i> argues that if you’re smart maybe you don’t. The truth that hovers over the album is perhaps uncomfortable because of how easy it can be to notice: of all the reworkings collected by Guy and Howard Lawrence, the best of the bunch are the ones that depart from the originals the least. That, too, is to say nothing of the two new Disclosure songs that bookend the 15-track set.</p>
<p>The lineup here is as starry and varied you’d expect for two kids billed on this year’s Coachella poster above <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"" target=""_blank"">Lana Del Rey</a>, an artist who has actual platinum plaques to her name. There are contemporaries (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"" target=""_blank"">Hudson Mohawke</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30453-baauer/"" target=""_blank"">Baauer</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29950-totally-enormous-extinct-dinosaurs/"" target=""_blank"">Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs</a>); up-and-comers (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30917-flume/"" target=""_blank"">Flume</a>, Kaytranada); legends (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6478-dj-premier/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Premier</a>, Larry Heard); and the London underground (T. Williams, Preditah, Wookie). This time it’s the old guys—the ones, maybe, with the least to prove—who best navigate the balance by undertaking alterations instead of redesigns.</p>
<p>The top remix comes from Chicago house luminary Larry Heard, who handles one of three new versions of “Help Me Lose My Mind” under his Mr. Fingers pseudo-alias. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18091-disclosure-settle/"" target=""_blank""><i>Settle</i></a>, the narcotic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30945-london-grammar/"" target=""_blank"">London Grammar</a> collaboration closes the album with what sounds like a cleanse but is actually shivering at its core—it's an <i>unsettling</i> finish. Here, Heard tips his hand: his is dubbed as a “chillout mix,” and that it is. He slows the track and replaces the jittery percussion with pitter-patter drums, a slowly tapped out piano chord, and an unhurried shaker. The tracks are quite similar, but where in the context of the original Hannah Reid’s vocals are a quiet plea, they're now soothed. With Heard, she finally manages to let her mind slip away.</p>
<p>The inclusion of DJ Premier may seem odd, but Guy Lawrence has long professed his love for boom bap and the duo do sample a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">J Dilla</a> beat on <i>Settle</i>. Odder is what comes of Primo’s take on “Latch”, a pop song with the sweep of house but the underpinnings of garage. His version throws obligatory scratches in early but otherwise transforms the song into a piano ballad. Yet, it’s fantastic: Primo’s drums punch exactly like you’d hope, but even better are the hard exhales he weaves into the percussion. This, well, panting is a sly but effective way of emphasizing the original’s headrush of desperation, and though track might feel like a left-turn, DJ Premier is only slightly fidgeting with a finished product—<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUK6HlzNWEg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vocalist Sam Smith’s acoustic rendition of “Latch""</a>.</p>
<p>From there, it's a sizable drop-off to the few remixes that are decent but inessential: with his “Voices”, Wookie smoothes the 2-step of the original into a pure house tune; and with his go at “Help Me Lose My Mind”, Paul Woolford summons the tropical euphoria of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28115-john-talabot/"" target=""_blank"">John Talabot</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28614-pional/"" target=""_blank"">Pional</a>. The rest aren’t noteworthy, save for a few dispiriting but high-profile exceptions. HudMo’s jagged swoop-and-crash makes for a bad fit with the twirling propulsion of “White Noise”, but worst is Baauer’s grotesquely garish “You &amp; Me”. The remix is clearly designed for the EDM festivals he gets booked for in the wake of “Harlem Shake”, but it's one that eviscerates the original’s delicate space. (Flume’s version of “You &amp; Me” at least heightens the drama.)<i></i></p>
<p><i>Settle: The Remixes</i> is a mostly fine listen, but Disclosure’s two originals do make you wonder why they even bothered. “Apollo”, which kicks off this album, is probably the deepest house track they’ve ever made, and as an open gesture to clubs it more or less invalidates the remixes here (T. Williams’ “Latch” or Preditah’s “Stimulation”) that seem to be tailored towards DJs that might never drop a Disclosure cut. Then there’s “Together”, the Lawrences' collaboration with Nile Rodgers, Smith, and Jimmy Napes, who co-wrote “Latch.”</p>
<p>“Together” is a squeeze of squelching funk—a deft one-off experiment as long as you can ignore how easy it is to hum the chorus of “Suit &amp; Tie” over the guitar lick. Smith sings of relaxing while draining a bottle of Sauvignon: “Let’s unwind together/ Ease our minds together.” It’s arguably a curious song to tack onto the end of a remix album, the type of project that often causes plenty of headaches while never quite coming together right. Nowadays we call this a subtweet.</p></div>"|18890.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18890-disclosure-settle-the-remixes/|5.9|Jordan Sargent

(The group’s name was a portmanteau of the words “cyborg” and “cyclotron,” and it was founded on the principle that a computer can be as good or better a musical collaborator as a person. At least part of the reason they played with drum machines in the first place was because Davis found human drummers unreliable.) As such it seems like it would be especially vulnerable to this effect, but judging by its latest reissue (which nearly doubles its tracks with remixes, instrumentals, and non-album singles) the worst damage that three decades have inflicted upon <i>Enter</i> is that some of its features—Davis’ stagey vocals, the Kraftwerkian drum machines, the occasional outburst of heavy metal guitar shredding—have become synonymous with the 80s, or at least how the era’s portrayed in hacky, 80s-themed comedies.</p>
<p>Davis and Atkins’ reliance on electronic sounds is less an aesthetic statement than a revolutionary one. They were among the first American pop musicians to fully grasp that synthesizers weren’t just a modern update of the organ but an entirely new kind of instrument, capable not only of emulating traditional instrumental sounds but obliterating them entirely. Even more importantly, they seem to have understood that this new technology had the potential to dramatically change the relationship between musicians and their instruments: when a person presses play on a drum machine’s pre-sequenced pattern, are they playing the drum machine or is it playing itself?</p>
<p>As diehard technophiles Atkins and Davis had no problem putting their gear front and center in the mix. Aside from their vocals and (on a few songs) John Housely’s guitar you can’t usually tell which parts were played by a person and which were sequenced. Trying to puzzle that out in a time where computer-assisted music making is commonplace enough that we can do it on our phones offers the barest hint of how challenging the concept was then.</p>
<p>But <i>Enter</i> isn’t just a record that should be listened to because it’s important—history aside it’s an intensely pleasurable experience. While you can make out the almost-completed outline of Detroit techno that Atkins and a few other musicians would fill in soon after, it’s not a techno record, exactly. The songs are more pop-oriented, with the verse-chorus-verse structures that techno treated as optional, and as much as Atkins and Davis were trying to emulate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a>, they were just as heavily influenced by Funkadelic, which comes through in their trippy Afrofuturistic lyrics and in Bootsy-esque bass lines that were far funkier than what Kraftwerk could manage. Neither of them had fully immersed themselves in the man-machine merger that would come to define techno, and there’s a kind of loose warm-bloodedness around the edges that makes the album feel like Davis and Atkins weren’t so much programming machines as trying to teach them the essential concept of funk.</p>
<p>The majority of people who attempt to predict the future end up dead wrong, but Atkins and Davis were pretty spot on about where pop music was headed. Like William Gibson, who was writing <i>Neuromancer</i> while they were recording <i>Enter</i>, they pulled this off by building a future that inspired other people enough to make it a reality. As well as becoming sample material for an untold number of musicians (“Clear”’s blippy synths provide the backbone to Missy Elliott’s 2005 “Lose Control” and Poison Clan’s 1992 “Shake Whatcha Mama Gave Ya”, among others), it laid out a whole musical philosophy that made more sense the more technology integrated itself into the act of making music, which is partly because of people trying to do what Cybotron was doing. In retrospect it was a self-fulfilling prophecy, and one that’s only becoming more influential all the time.</p></div>"|18886.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18886-cybotron-enter/|8.7|Miles Raymer

But here's the funny thing about the rejuvenation efforts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1200-del-tha-funkee-homosapien/"" target=""_blank"">Del the Funky Homosapien</a>'s undergone over the past six months: after turning in a weary, muddled-sounding, much-belated sequel to his highly revered <i>Deltron 3030 </i>guise, he just popped up and abruptly dropped a no-hype free release that's easily the most consistently satisfying thing he's done since 2000. And it's in a sort of permutation of his style that evokes that very same 2000—not the towering concept-record ambition of Deltron, but a compact reprise of the mocking, unpredictable endorphin rush of <i>Both Sides of the Brain</i>. “Lyrically ill but fun to listen to, nothing super heavy,” he describes <i>Iller Than Most</i> on that Soundcloud page. It's a bit of an understatement.</p>
<p>For one thing, <i>Iller Than Most</i> is off-the-hinges ridiculous. If your follow-up question to that description is “ridiculous good or ridiculous goofy?” the answer is a straight-up “yes”: Del in peak cartoon taunt mode is all kinds of preposterous, dedicated as much to twisting his own voice into grotesque yet charismatic caricatures of itself as he is to talking smack in more traditional cadence. (Think less “late-period <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1339-eminem/"" target=""_blank"">Eminem</a>” and more “peak <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1434-e-40/"" target=""_blank"">E-40</a>""). That approach pays off early with the opening one-two of “Leader” and “Boogieman"", where he respectively goes Russell-Crowe-berserk on some ripoff artists and warns oblivious crumbsnatchers to check under their beds. It's like inverted horrorcore, serial-asskicker/supernatural-force rhetoric wrung inside-out to wiseass effect.</p>
<p>And here's another lure for you: Del's production style alone is worth the price of admission (or it would be if there was any admission). For someone who came up on his lyrical reputation, he's also musically minded enough to pull off immediate hooks and find a way to make the one jump out on even the more left-field beats. Tracks range from simple-enough hard-knock minimalism laced with laser-ricochet drums (“Delta Time”, “Militant”) to clanky, shoulder-disjointing squalls (“Robust”, “Bitin' Ain't Samplin'”) that should have fans asking him what his favorite <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29614-death-grips/"" target=""_blank"">Death Grips</a> track is. The last moments of closer “Land of Immediate Rap Hits” is a blast of gargling decay that makes the ideal playlist segue into your track of choice from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18779-death-grips-government-plates/"" target=""_blank""><i>Government Plates</i></a>.</p>
<p>For the most part, <i>Iller Than Most </i>is good old-fashioned self-big-up material, though it's not entirely fair to call something old-fashioned if it's done in a style without much precedent outside Del's corner of the Bay. As one-note as it gets to hear him go on and on about his underground realness (“Robust”) and mano y mano mic scraps (“10 Paces”) and mental fitness (“Mental Fitness”), it's still impressive how he's still found ways to make those lines stand out more than twenty years after his <i>sophomore </i>album. The monomaniacal rap-battler tunnelvision that fueled 93's <i>No Need for Alarm </i>is the lyrical mode of choice here to seep into the <i>Both Sides </i>vibe, but with the abrupt rubber-voiced u-turns and cranky ad-libs, it's too fun to feel like being buried under a pile of recycled wolf tickets.</p></div>"|18882.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18882-del-the-funky-homosapien-iller-than-most/|7.4|Nate Patrin

The long-gestating debut LP from the San Francisco psych-pop duo is a bright, spangling, decidedly summery affair, all radiant harmonies and warm reverberations. Forever's pleasures are simple, breezy, a little like bringing a parka to the pool: you're supposed to dive right in, not waste a lot of time peeling back the layers. <i>Forever</i> is lush, easygoing, 39 balmy minutes in paradise. But spend too much time in these all-too-pleasant surroundings, and you can't help but feel like you've been there before.<br/><br/>Cousins Reese Donohue and Christopher Prudhomme planted the seeds of Painted Palms when the pair were separated by a dozen states, gradually building up tracks from the snippets they'd shoot back-and-forth through email. And, though they've both called San Francisco home for a number of years, <i>Forever</i>'s shimmering construction is mostly in line with their earlier efforts. Like a lot of young bands, they're certainly not shy about their fondness for the Beach Boys and their legions of sonic followers; especially <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>, and even more especially, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Panda Bear</a>'s 2007 landmark <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10025-person-pitch/"" target=""_blank""><i>Person Pitch</i></a>. The Palms do have a few legs up on much of the not-exactly-thin post-<i>Pitch</i> crowd; their sound's fuller, the sense of melody better defined. And, in Prudhomme, they've got a singer who serves as their answer to Noah Lennox. On ""Too High,"" for instance, Prudhomme cuts through the track's radar-gun reverb with a swooping, choirboy-in-an-echo-chamber vocal line packed with the long vowel sounds Lennox favors. The similarities don't stop in Prudhomme's throat; between <i>Forever</i>'s droning intros, distressed breakbeats, and prickly calliope-style keyboards, it's fairly clear just who these guys owe much of their sound to.<br/><br/>Lyrically, <i>Forever</i> concerns itself with a lot of minor communication breakdowns: ""never ever said the things that mattered,"" ""she didn't understand that I was having trouble in my head."" And, in keeping with the music's endlessly summery vibe, the rest is pleasantly half-baked: ""look at my hands and look at the air,"" ""when I see the light,"" ""I can't tell if I'm high or low."" What there's not, unfortunately, is any sense of urgency, anything lending these songs much in the way of consequence or fervor. That ""never said the things that mattered"" line (from ""Soft Hammer"", <i>Forever</i>'s most unadulterated Beach Boys nod) seems especially telling. These songs may be well-crafted, busy without being overcluttered, built around strong—if not particularly distinctive—melodies. But, since Prudhomme and Donohue haven't quite yet figured out how to assert themselves above their fairly obvious influences, where personality's concerned, they're a little lacking.<br/><br/>Between the carefully plotted reference points and the not-exactly-gripping lyrics, <i>Forever</i> tends to run together over the course of its 39-minute runtime. Still, taken song-for-song, there's no shortage of takeaways: the bouncy ""Not Really There"", the ambling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5633-atlas-sound/"" target=""_blank"">Atlas Sound</a>-alike ""Carousel"", the late-LP one-two of the brash ""Spinning Signs"" and the tender ""Sleepwalking."" Donohue and Prudhomme certainly know their way around a melody, and their careful craftsmanship puts them a notch or two ahead of the oft-slapdash box-ticking of a lot of easily led up-and-comers. But, if they hope to keep it going through the next cold snap, Painted Palms still need to figure out a way to bring a little more of themselves to the party.</p></div>"|18848.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18848-painted-palms-forever/|5.7|Paul Thompson

Before breaking up in 1992, the trio of Collins, fellow singer/guitarist Dan Kroha, and drummer Peggy O’Neill set back garage rock by thirty years—which was exactly the point. Disgusted by the polished jangle of much of the garage revival of the 80s, the Gories turned rudimentary musicianship into a fuck-you virtue, making the punk of any era sound like Vivaldi. Until now, the Gories have been documented by studio recordings, including three untouchably savage LPs and a barrage of singles and compilation cuts. The only thing missing was a live album—which has now been rectified by <i>The Shaw Tapes: Live in Detroit 5/27/88</i>.</p>
<p>Recorded at a party in a converted Detroit storefront in the spring of 1988—a year before the Gories’ debut album, <i>House Rockin’</i>—<i>The Shaw Tapes</i> bleeds Motor City tradition. Of the albums many cover songs, four of them are by Detroit artists: the Keggs’ 60s garage-punk scorcher “To Find Out”; Eddie Holland’s punchy, early-Motown R&amp;B stomper “Leaving Here” (although the Gories’ rendition seems to owe more to the Who’s guitar-heavy 1965 version); the Stooges’ primal, sinister “Real Cool Time”; and “Again &amp; Again,” a rare track by Iggy Pop’s pre-Stooges outfit the Iguanas. “To Find Out” is the only song of the four that the Gories eventually recording in the studio. The rest are pulped to a slovenly blur of brute havoc. As if deconstructing the Detroit rock mythos he’d never stray from (his current band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1194-the-dirtbombs/"" target=""_blank"">the Dirtbombs</a> included), Collins howls his head off during a run through John Lee Hooker’s seminal 1948 debut, “Boogie Chillen’”—a song that recounts Hooker’s arrival in Detroit (where the original single was recorded), and his experience being a stranger who “was walking down Hastings Street”, heard tell of “Henry’s Swing Club”, and dropped in to find everyone “really having a ball.”</p>
<p>That same air of raucous chaos suffuses <i>The Shaw Tapes</i>. The storefront that the Gories played in may not have been Henry’s Swing Club, but it swung nonetheless—that is, if the crowd noise is to be believed. Sweat practically oozes out of the group’s feverish, stripped-to-the-skivvies versions of the Stoics’ nasty, 1967 anthem “Hate”, not to mention a face-clawing brawl with the Yardbirds’ arrangement of Tiny Bradshaw’s “Train Kept-A-Rollin’”. It’s the scabrous renditions of Gories originals, though, that is most gripping. Drawn almost entirely from the body of material that would form <i>House Rockin’</i>, these off-kilter, out-of-tune iterations of “I Think I’ve Had It”, “Charm Bag”, “Sovereignty Flight”, and “Give Me Love” show just how deliberate their demolition was before it became ever-so-slightly contained it. And when Collins busts into the soon-to-be-anthem “Thunderbird ESQ”—an ode to the fortified wine he’s admitted to chugging whole bottles of before going onstage back then—it’s as if the song had always existed, a fossil just waiting to be excavated, cloned, and set loose upon the world.</p>
<p>As blistering and vital as <i>The Shaw Tapes</i> is, it’s not the definitive Gories live album. Theoretically such a record would have to include far more of the band’s originals, especially classics like “Nitroglycerine” from 1990’s <i>I Know You Fine, But How You Doin’</i> and “Telepathic” from 1992’s <i>Outta Here</i>, which demonstrate just how potent and confident the Gories became just before imploding. That fact only slightly diminishes the importance of <i>The Shaw Tapes</i>—a slapdash snapshot of a young, feral gang of throwbacks reinventing a genre by uninventing it.</p></div>"|18877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18877-the-gories-the-shaw-tapes-live-in-detroit-52788/|7.0|Jason Heller

It was, he claimed, inspired by the death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who was shot 19 times when four New York City police officers mistook his wallet for a gun. The song was a deeply empathetic response to the tragedy, as a famous rock star tried to see the world from the point of view of both the police officers who work rough neighborhoods and the African American residents who find themselves in danger for even the most harmless actions. Even before many people had actually heard it, “American Skin” sparked controversy, as New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Police Chief Howard Safir publically condemned both the singer and the song. Particularly egregious was the reaction of Bob Lucente, the head of the State Fraternal Order of Police, who called Springsteen both a “dirtbag” and a “floating fag.”</p>
<p>For his part, Springsteen weathered the uproar stoically. He explained in interviews that the song wasn’t necessarily anti-cop, but he didn’t shy away from making it a permanent addition to his setlists during that tour. A studio version was released to radio stations, but the song wasn’t available commercially until the following year, when it appeared at the beginning of disc two of 2001’s <i>Live in New York City</i>. In the decade since, it has collected dust as a footnote in Springsteen’s late-career catalog—a reminder, when you needed one, that he could still write a powerful and topical song. In 2009, however, he revived “American Skin” and began dedicating performances to Trayvon Martin, and that sad new relevance is ostensibly the reason the song appears on Springsteen’s 18th album, <i>High Hopes, </i>a collection of new recordings of songs that he has been playing for 10 or 12 years. Essentially these are all outtakes from <i>The Rising</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10733-magic/""><i>Magic</i></a>, and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12614-working-on-a-dream/"">Working on a Dream</a></i><i>,</i> but Springsteen re-recorded them with producer Ron Aniello and sequenced them into a standalone album.</p>
<p>The Boss has a famously deep archive of quality songs from throughout his career, so there’s no reason to scoff at the concept behind <i>High Hopes</i>. Fans have been bootlegging these songs for years now, which means the album is aptly titled: There are high hopes for studio versions of almost all of these songs, especially “American Skin”. The new version, though, has stiff competition. The performance on <i>Live in</i> <i>New York City</i> gains its power from the concert setting, with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26563-bruce-springsteen-and-the-e-street-band/"">E Street Band</a> alternating vocals to create a sense of community and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29734-clarence-clemons/"">Clarence Clemons</a>’ sax solo sounding like a heartfelt eulogy. The studio version from 2001 duplicates that arrangement, only without Springsteen telling the crowd, “We need a little quiet.”</p>
<p>But, unfortunately, the <i>High Hopes</i> recording of “American Skin” highlights everything that’s gone wrong with Springsteen’s music in the 21st century. It’s garish and melodramatic, with a cluttered arrangement and slick production that distracts from its message. The song open with Springsteen singing ""41 shots,"" but his vocals are distorted and distant--a cheap effect. There is some industrial percussion that would have sounded dated in 2000, and there is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19422-tom-morello/"">Tom Morello</a>’s guitar solo, which could have been cribbed from some third-tier 80s power ballad. In 2013, the song is too aware of its own import, which means it strains for the same sense of gravity that once came easily. Live, Springsteen was able to play up the contradictions and colliding perspectives fueling the country’s race problems, even implicating himself in the process, but now his outrage has curdled into something like dulled resignation.</p>
<p>Springsteen has struggled in the 2000s to find the best musical vehicle for his thoughts on the state of America. Live, the E Street Band can be a powerhouse, as the sexagenarian continues to exude charisma and energy on stage. The studio, however, is another thing. <i>Nebraska</i> aside, Springsteen has never been a minimalist, but his recent output has been maximalist in all the wrong directions. Rather than the Spectorian wall of sound he perfected on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7728-born-to-run-30th-anniversary-edition/""><i>Born to Run</i></a> and <i>The River</i>, he now dabbles in studio gimmicks that sound both expensive and dated: vocal distortion, caked-on production, pots-and-pans percussion, inert drum loops, a puzzling fascination with Celtic flourishes. On <i>High Hopes</i> the thick arrangements distract from the good songwriting and conceal the bad, often to the extent that it’s impossible to discern which is which.</p>
<p>The result is an album that often sounds salvageable but continually trips over its own ambitions and good intentions. On “Heaven’s Wall” the gospel choir overwhelms the song completely, disrupting the careful cadence of the verses and any nuance the lyrics might carry; rather than righteous, it comes across as self-righteous. “Harry’s Place” is all setting and no story, with details borrowed from an Elmore Leonard novel. Most tragic may be the closing cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"">Suicide</a>’s “Dream Baby Dream”, which begins promisingly with Springsteen’s gravelly voice and an accordion mimicking the New York duo’s gutter drone. It’s a quietly powerful moment, but you just know he’s going to do something to ruin it. And sure enough the song builds to a manufactured climax full of corny drum loops and gloppy strings.</p>
<p>Springsteen is too much of a control freak to escape blame, but perhaps most culpable is Tom Morello, who is apparently a member of the E Street Band now. For the last few years Morello has grown seemingly embarrassed by his rap-rock history with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3515-rage-against-the-machine/"">Rage Against the Machine</a>, when making his guitar sound like a turntable carried some cultural weight. He does share with Springsteen a few populist heroes, namely <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14407-woody-guthrie/"">Woody Guthrie</a> and John Steinbeck. Otherwise, they apparently have little in common beyond their politics, and Morello sounds awkwardly fitted to these songs. He shreds gracelessly through the cover of the Havalinas’ “High Hopes” and clutters “Heaven’s Wall” with squall and distortion. When his guitar isn’t disruptive, it’s simply superfluous. Often it’s just dumbfounding: his solos on “The Ghost of Tom Joad”—which gets a passable cock-rock makeover that owes a debt to Rage Against the Machine’s cover—sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12366-david-gilmour/"">David Gilmour</a> sitting in with Cinderella.  </p>
<p>An unwelcome presence, Morello is simply the most obvious of many elements on <i>High Hopes </i>that just don’t work. It’s all the more unfortunate given that there are actually some redeemable songs here, along with some brief glimpses of Springsteen the rock'n'roll storyteller. Even as he eclipses 60, he’s one of the few rock veterans still concerned with actually rocking, which he does convincingly on “Just Like Fire Would” and “Frankie Fell in Love”—two negligible songs that you might dismiss on a better album. Here they sound actually feisty and even ribald, with a fire that is squelched on the more serious numbers. I can’t tell if those highs actually redeem the album somewhat or make it even more of a disappointment, but I do know that the out-in-the-streets details of “Frankie Fell in Love” are more humane and meaningful than the grandiose philosophizing of “Hunter of Invisible Game”. Instead of trying so hard to live up to the times, perhaps he just needs to work on capturing a moment. </p></div>"|18833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18833-bruce-springsteen-high-hopes/|4.0|Stephen M.

Something really, really stupid. Something that is destined for failure.” So <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink told me back in the summer of 2012</a> about why—in addition to studying and making art—he started recording music at home while still a disgruntled teenager. And while the phantasmal-turned-flesh band of his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink’s Haunted Graffiti</a> started in the early 21st century and metastasized into the Zeitgeist by decade’s end, this 2xCD digs into Pink’s earliest rock dreams, of becoming “the worst thing,” wherein a wooden Pinocchio wakes up one day to be a real live piece of shit. While his wish might have been that people would always ignore such early experiments, <i>Early Live</i> Recordings proves that qualities such as stupidity and failure can too be destined to become a commodity.</p>
<p>While there are no exact dates to peg either disc one’s project title <i>Gorilla</i> or disc two’s <i>Appleasians</i> to, both recordings appear to predate Pink’s inspired 21st century spurts. The press sheet hints at these 36 tracks being “salvaged from the same scratchpile of crumbling CD-Rs and 8-track cassettes” that also produced last year’s <i>Thrash &amp; Burn</i> set. My guess would be that <i>Gorilla</i> is the documented proof of what Pink described as his first forays into recording, which entailed “an unplugged bass and a three-string guitar recorded through a set of headphones, which (was) used as a microphone.”</p>
<p>They are lo-fi recordings to say the least, heavy on detuned bass, lackadaisical tambourine rattles, and feral growls, all of it couched in tape murk. Opener “Berzerker” has lurching bass, coughs, and feedback that gobbles up everything on the tape. Elsewhere Pink approximates a rabid bark, tries on a dozen different personas as he wails “Why am I so sad?,” growls out “Nazi love” as if gargling bile, and deploys a plugged nose British accent that might prove paternity to King Krule. There’s also four excruciating minutes of him incanting “by the powers of Grayskull.”</p>
<p>Things brighten considerably on <i>Appleasians</i>, as he fumbles towards lyrics and chords over stains of noise. “Tractor Man” shows the earliest glint of Pink’s pop acumen and glib vocals. Songs like “Something in Your Eye” and “Inside Looking Out” features the chug, stumble, and sneer of an early garage rock single, one that bore fruit on <i>Before Today</i>’s cover of the Ramrods’ “Bright Lit Blue Skies”.</p>
<p>But as the set stumbles along, Pink tips his hand as that mythological unlearned naïf, that unfrozen caveman in modern society. The back half of <i>Gorilla</i> finds him namechecking <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"" target=""_blank"">Can</a>’s gibberish specialist Damo Suzuki and the Germs’ Darby Crash, proof that even in making terrible music that barely approximates either man’s mutterings, he had immaculate taste in both German prog and LA’s scum punk. And on <i>Appleasians</i>, he tackles two totemic 60s primitives, the Godz and the Shaggs. He condenses the epic thud of the former’s “Crusade” to a concise 2:50 while finding the bizarre sweetness of the latter’s “My Cutie”, a deep album cut from their even more obscure 1982 album, <i>Shaggs’ Own Thing</i>.</p>
<p>While excavating the eight Haunted Graffiti albums revealed repulsive and alluring sounds in equal measure, <i>Early Live Recordings</i>' only real crime is that little of it fascinates. Poking about here for the roots of Pink’s omnivorous pop genius ultimately bears little in the way of edible fruit, but he himself has never pretended to be anything otherwise: “I’m not trying to break new ground,” he said in that cover story. “That’s part of the whole point. The stagnation of things is inherent in my cerebral process.” Stagnant yes, but consider this to be the cesspool from which a 21st century idiot savant arose.</p></div>"|18837.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18837-ariel-pink-early-live-recordings/|4.4|Andy Beta

Like fellow New York MC <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30330-ka/"" target=""_blank"">Ka</a>, Marciano's voice rarely rises above a conversational purr—you need to really lean in close to get the full effect. He doesn't build narratives as much as construct small, distinct images and then stack them on top of each other. Even his beats are designed to shade, rather than color, his songs. Over the course of his first two albums, he's established himself as one of the foremost purveyors of classicist New York slick-talk, digging into a very specific sound and exploring just how far down he can go. His latest release, <i>Marci Beaucoup</i>, finds Marciano stepping out of the spotlight ever so slightly and instead focusing more on his production chops than his already-proven lyrical skills.</p>
<p>Whereas 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17301-reloaded/"" target=""_blank""><i>Reloaded</i> </a>was a comparatively lighter sonic affair than its predecessor, the bleaker <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14720-marcberg/"" target=""_blank""><i>Marcberg</i></a>, <i>Marci Beaucoup</i> hews closer to the grimier aesthetic of Marciano's debut, where the production felt more off-the-cuff and rougher around the edges. Like that album, the beats on <i>Marci Beaucoup</i> are handled entirely by Marciano, and they alternate between minimalist RZA-esque menace and monochromatic soul. As a producer, Marciano shares the same penchant for bite-sized vocal loops that were <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">J Dilla</a>'s bread and butter, and he's able to create a palpable tension by drawing out the hypnotic qualities in them. ""Love Means"" is only allowed to unspool during its brief hook—otherwise, it's all creeping dread masquerading as a serenade. These sorts of little touches can be found everywhere: horns lazily snake into the corners of ""Squeeze""; shouts from what sound like children on a playground litter ""Dollar Bitch""; elsewhere, a single bleat from an ill-timed chop signals the end of each loop on the loping ""War Scars"".</p>
<p>These beats are insistent and physical, even when they're made out of lullabies twisted into unnatural shapes, as is the case with ""Didn't Know"", an example of Marciano's willingness to think outside of the box as a producer. Like every track on the album, a few friends pop by to help out, but only Freeway sounds totally out of his element here, his verse only made worse by the virulent homophobia contained within it.</p>
<p>Because there's not a single track where Marciano raps on his own, <i>Marci Beaucoup</i> feel like a compilation curated by Marciano more than a true solo effort. And as solid as these beats are, they best fit the kind of rappers who operate in a headspace similar to Marciano's, but that's not always who ends up on them. Those with tightly-coiled deliveries fare best—Boldy James scrapes the bottom of ""Trying to Come Up"" as if he hasn't eaten in a month, and Action Bronson adds some much welcome levity to ""456"".</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, it's Ka, the rapper who best compliments Marciano, who steals the tracks he shows up on with his blank-faced gravitas. Unfortunately, too many appearances from third-stringers like Knowledge the Pirate and Maffew Ragazino just made me wish Marciano was rapping instead, and a few more solo cuts would've helped alleviate the frequent soggy stretches. As a proper third album, <i>Marci Beaucoup</i> doesn't stack up to its precursors, but as an advertisement for Marciano's services as a beatsmith, it's much more successful.</p></div>"|18879.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18879-roc-marciano-marci-beaucoup/|6.8|Renato Pagnani

It’s also not too difficult: connect the dots between the dark sounds of early CD-R’s, the dense psych of 2010’s <i>Headless Ark</i>, and the damaged rock of 2012’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17403-go-easy/"">Go Easy</a></i>, and you’ll trace an arc sloping toward accessibility. And their latest, <i>Grassed Inn</i>, is their most structured, tune-heavy album—as well as their best.</p>
<p>But things are never that easy with Blank Realm. Sharp tunes have popped up throughout their discography, often sandwiched between denser noises. Take their catchiest song to date, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16226-blank-realm-falling-down-the-stairs/"">“Falling Down the Stairs.”</a> It’s the second track on <i>Grassed Inn</i>, but it’s actually been in the band’s repertoire for a while, with <a href=""http://youtu.be/Td2Nc7Ho7lk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">live evidence</a> dating back as far as two years ago. More importantly, <i>Grassed Inn</i> is far from smooth or streamlined. The band remains unafraid to spill outside lines, hit off awkward phrases and off notes, and continually stretch themselves. They’ll still take energy and impulse over caution or precision, and that gives even their shapliest songs an edge of unpredictability. It also means that, like every Blank Realm album before it, <i>Grassed Inn</i> makes more sense—and sounds better and better—the more you listen.</p>
<p>A lot of that grow-on-you logic comes from the vocals of siblings Daniel and Sarah Spencer. Their high-pitched snarls still evoke the two-headed Stones-licking of Neil Hagerty and Jennifer Herrema during <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3610-royal-trux/"">Royal Trux</a>’s prime. The combination gives chugging opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16444-back-to-the-flood/"">“Back to the Flood”</a> dizzying momentum, and pushes the loping “Bulldozer Love” into a rave-up rush. What’s different this time is Daniel’s more prominent role. His breathy whine leads most tracks, echoed by the silkier purr of Sarah. His knack at tugging at lines, elongating vowels, and yelping words reminds me most of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2052-richard-hell/"">Richard Hell</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"">Lou Reed</a>. Both saw unconventional voices not as weaknesses but weapons, making every syllable expressive instead of falling back on natural talent. Daniel’s similar skills create tension when paired with structured songs, often bending them to match his curvy, spiked path.</p>
<p>As a result, as you get deeper into <i>Grassed Inn</i> and more in tune with Daniel’s probing style, less-overtly catchy tracks become as earworm-ready as “Falling Down the Stairs.” The drum-machine pulse of “Violet Delivery” builds into waves every time Daniel and Sarah overstress the song’s title, while “Baby Closes the Door” coalesces into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16240-va-tally-ho-flying-nuns-greatest-bits/"">Flying Nun</a>-style garage-pop, albeit filtered through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a>-like guitar dissonance. Blank Realm’s endearing slacker side persists too: “Even the Score” sounds like a sleepy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a> amble, or a stoner take on the Velvet Underground’s <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I'm_Waiting_for_the_Man"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Waiting for the Man,” </a>giving its title a hint of double entendre.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>After all that sideways approach to melodic tuneage, it makes weird sense that Blank Realm would end </span><i>Grassed Inn </i><span>with a song perhaps catchier, and definitely slicker, than “Falling Down the Stairs.” The lilting “Reach You on the Phone” could almost fit in an 80’s movie soundtrack, its soaring synth seemingly nicked from groups like</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/757-the-church/""><span> the Church </span></a><span>and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19331-psychedelic-furs/""><span>Psychedelic Furs</span></a><span>. Were the band to make an album of just songs like this, it would be hard to resist their odd shine. But Blank Realm is still bent on mixing the diamonds with the rough, and on </span><i>Grassed Inn </i><span>that particular swirl is at its most intoxicating.</span></p></div>"|18849.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18849-blank-realm-grassed-inn/|8.0|Marc Masters

Singer Hazel Wilde has cited the grim economic outlook of her homeland as a main lyrical influence. And so, there you have it<i>—</i></span><i>Until the Colours Run </i><span>certainly doesn’t lack for external drama, serving as both a make-or-break album </span><span>and </span><span>a reintroduction. </span></p>
<p>Marquee indie rock acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend"">Vampire Weekend</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire"">Arcade Fire</a> and probably <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national"">the National</a> are bands who work outside typical power trio structures while their lyrical concerns trace concentric circles of worry, from personal to societal to political to spiritual. And it’s populist for an ability to establish a relatable foothold lyrically and leave it up to the listener whether they want it to serve as direct commentary or grand allegory. This is progress for Lanterns on the Lake, who generated similar comparisons on <i>Gracious Tide</i> based on Paul Gregory’s string-laden arrangements and production. <i>Until the Colours Run</i> is warmer and more organic than its predecessor, though still squarely within indie rock’s “baroque” settings, nearly every component given a pleasingly faded luster: silvery guitar figures that twinkle, glisten and decay, echoing drums that sound both intimidating and fragile, a sobering layer of reverb over Wilde’s vocals. Whether it’s the all-out, crescendoing assaults of “Elodie” or the one-take piano ballad “Green &amp; Gold<i>"", Until the Colours Run</i> always bears the weight of its struggles, expressing even its joy in antiquated and Americanized imagery of unemployment lines and buffalos; as indicated by the record’s key line of “we’ll drink and sing on the breadline,"" happiness rarely exists on its own terms, but rather as a counter to exceedingly difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>It’s not to the discredit of LotL that <i>Until the Colours Run</i> lacks unfettered happiness or guileless pop pleasure. More problematic is that it lacks release of any kind, cathartic or otherwise. Thematically, LotL express faded glory and missed opportunities while exhibiting potential with so many rich sounds and potent concepts. Unfortunately, they often lack the things that separate the aforementioned A-listers from the scores of similarly-minded bands, namely, propulsion, hooks and personal detail. Opener “Elodie” whips up a dramatic setting with the same skyward drum rolls and pinging guitars that allowed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1388-explosions-in-the-sky"">Explosions in the Sky</a> to corner the market on “cinematic” and “sweeping,” but the melody and rhythm of the verse never find their footing. It’s indicative of LotL’s most disappointing habit going forward, of introducing an arresting melody or guitar figure that ultimately gets lost in muddled compositions or overbearing production tricks. Based on its title and its position as the penultimate track, you know “Another Tale From Another English Town” is meant as the final pep talk, and “We’ve been sold a thousand lies/we just wanted the quiet life/but they won’t stop until they see us in the ground” certainly sounds like a rallying cry, albeit one that’s universal because it bears no sense of the troubles specific to Wilde or her bandmates.</p>
<p>Unintentionally, “Another Tale” does become emblematic of <i>Until the Colours Run</i>’s unmet ambitions, which ends up recalling the sound of the National less than one of their most oft-quoted lyrics: “let’s not try and figure out everything at once.” It’s sound advice for LotL, not just in regards to their overzealously embellished music, but also as a rejoinder to the record's emotional tenor, a jittery, post-caffeine comedown where you’ve recognized the tasks at hand for the day and they seem just a little too daunting to even begin tackling. If you’re in that mindframe, <i>Until the Colours Run</i> works just fine for an all-purpose wallow, but it’s simply too ponderous to be the galvanizing social commentary to which it aspires.</p></div>"|18850.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18850-lanterns-on-the-lake-until-the-colours-run/|6.2|Ian Cohen

We have more or less reconciled ourselves to this phenomenon. But very few bands come back wiped clean of their basic essence, as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18560-pixies-ep-1/"" target=""_blank"">the Pixies</a> did with last fall's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18560-pixies-ep-1/""><i>EP-1</i></a>. Their mystery, their fidgety precision, their peculiar tensed grin, was simply erased, replaced by an utterly indistinguishable modern rock band. The severity of the cognitive dissonance was almost fascinating, or it would have been if the music weren't so brutally anodyne. Had any legendary band returned with new material this limp and attenuated before?</p>
<p>We have another chance to consider the question. <i>EP-2,</i> released this week, dates from the same recording sessions as the first. (There is one more on the way.) The four new songs here are less blank than the four on the first, if only marginally: ""Magdalena"" and ""Snakes"" arouse the faint suspicion that you might be listening to the Pixies, or at least vaguely Pixies-inspired music. The minor-key chorus and stairstep chord progression to ""Magdalena"" is the most harmonically rich moment they've managed since reuniting. Black's lead vocal is muted and sensitive, and it sounds, passingly, like a lesser track from <i>Bossanova</i> or <i>Teenager of the Yea</i>r.</p>
<p>They are the <i>only</i> moments, however. The appealing, smeary lead guitar line on ""Green and Blues"" introduces a thin, banal rock song, both melodically and lyrically devoid of interesting ideas—the chorus turns on “I'm wasting your time just talking to you/ Maybe best to go on home/I’ll leave you alone.” Black sings of being an alien, a visitor, but his eccentricity, his fundamental strangeness, has never been less evident. The Pixies traded in unpredictability and startling outbursts—they were <i>pixies</i>, for god's sake. Mischief, subversion, and nonsense were part of their job description. Frank's scream used to be vivid in part because it emerged out of nowhere, a teddy bear that suddenly became a golem. On""Blue Eyed Hexe"", he screams like a Brian Johnson imitator over a foursquare riff with no wit or play in it, the clonking woodblock hitting like a kid brother socking you repeatedly in the arm. It is arguably worse, more slow-witted, and painful than anything on the original EP. </p>
<p>The gulf between the feel this music has on the mind and the name on the cover remains jarring. Frank Black has been making more traditional, MOR rock recordings under his own name since the Pixies disbanded, but even his most meat-and-potatoes solo offerings had <i>something</i>—a flutter of vulnerability, a darker streak beneath the riffs that suggested mischief and imagination. When he played with country and roots-rock tropes on quickly assembled, low-stakes creative projects like <i>Paley &amp; Francis</i>, the crooked grin was legible beneath the surface. The songs collected on these two EPs display almost no creative vision or signature.</p>
<p>Black and the remaining original members—Joey Santiago, David Lovering—seem intent, above all, on pushing their brand forward. They <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53171-pixies-fire-bassist-kim-shattuck/"" target=""_blank"">recently dismissed Kim Shattuck</a>, the bassist hired in Kim Deal’s conspicuous absence, and hired Paz Lenchantin. In all of this, they are moving with a bracing, almost refreshingly blunt cynicism: the Pixies are a franchise now, and franchises need to keep moving. Fair enough. But even the most mercenary-minded, craven reboot works if there is some evident love of the source material, and this is where these EPs fail so pitifully. These eight songs would be subpar, unremarkable work for a band with no reputation or mythology to live up to; for the Pixies, they are an increasingly mournful asterisk affixed to a beloved legacy. </p></div>"|18875.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18875-pixies-ep-2/|2.0|Jayson Greene

Naturally, the Soundcloud stream vanished as quickly as it appeared, and Island/Republic rushed <i>Dirty Gold</i>’s official release date up to December 30. For Haze, it was self-sabotage from a sales perspective (abysmal numbers and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16912-somethin-bout-kreay""><i>Somethin ‘Bout Kreay</i> </a>reminiscences have floated around Twitter this week), but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53427-watch-angel-haze-explains-why-she-leaked-her-album-dirty-gold"">in a video</a> she posted a few days after the leak, Haze was defiant, heated and seemingly without a trace of regret. Still, the fearless words she lobs at her label (""Yeah, I’m gonna support your dreams, but I’m also gonna fuck with them"") only underscore an unfortunate point: There’s a lot more fire in Angel Haze than you’d know from the often lackluster <i>Dirty Gold</i>.</p>
<p>The initial releases that gained Haze notice—first her brashly confessional <i><a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Angel-Haze-Voice-EP-mixtape.339222.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Voice</a></i> EP and then 2012’s head-turning<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16883-reservation-ep""> <i>Reservation</i></a>—mixed an unlocked-diary sensibility with a machinegun flow. Haze was raised in what she’s called a religious cult—and in a strict Pentecostal household where pop and hip-hop were banned until she was 16. Her music displays the hyperactive enthusiasm and ferocious hunger of an autodidact making up for lost time: She often sounds like someone who quickly gobbled up every great record she missed out on in the 90s (early Eminem and Lauryn Hill especially) and wants to spit their teachings back at you as fast and nimbly as she can.</p>
<p>No one will come away from this album doubting Haze’s natural talent, but <i>Dirty Gold</i> lacks the spark and distinct personality of a proper coming-out. In the past, Haze’s most searing lines showed a knack for unflinching detail (2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14487-cleaning-out-my-closet"">""Cleaning Out My Closet""</a> confronted the listener with the vivid realities of sexual abuse, rather than the hazy, comforting euphemisms we usually use to describe it), but too often the songs on <i>Dirty Gold</i> deal in vague troubles and one-size-fits-all obstacles. It’s a noble intention; she's clearly trying to reach out to the listener directly and make her music as inclusive as possible. But over the course of these 12 songs, so much emphasis on universal ""trials"" and ""struggles"" actually has the opposite effect. ""Don’t give up,"" she insists. ""You gotta make the decision to be the one difference in your life and turn it around."" Though her heart’s in the right place, too often the big-tent slogans on <i>Dirty Gold</i> pass over you like the sayings on a high school guidance counselor’s bulletin board.</p>
<p>""Never catch me at the club/ I get high and dance alone,"" Haze spits on one of the stickier tracks, the strobe-lit single ""Echelon (It’s My Way)"". Though she’s always worn her outsider stance with pride, <i>Dirty Gold</i> shows how it sometimes works against her. Left to her own devices, Haze’s tastes skew maudlin (the first rap song inspired by a Tom DeLonge side project, ""Angles &amp; Airwaves"" makes a <a href=""file://localhost/AngelHaze/status/419922405508001793"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">possibly intentional</a> case for Haze as rap game Mitch Albom), but this might not be a problem if she found the right collaborator to prod her in more provocative directions and keep these impulses in check. <i>Dirty Gold</i>’s producer Markus Dravs—who recently won a Grammy for his work with Mumford &amp; Sons and has also produced for Arcade Fire and Coldplay—doesn’t quite have the hip-hop pedigree to give Haze the distinct beats she’s still searching for. For all it boasts of independence, <i>Dirty Gold</i> lifts some pretty obvious moves from recent chart-toppers: The hooky (and hokey) ""Planes Fly"" tries on Macklemore’s heart-on-faux-chinchilla-sleeve look; the hook (sung and written by Sia) on the montage-ready “Battle Cry” will leave you humming its doppelganger <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uelHwf8o7_U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Love the Way You Lie""</a>; and ""Echelon (It’s My Way)"" feels like an immaculately formatted resume slipped to someone at the A$AP Mob recruitment office.</p>
<p><i>Dirty Gold</i> is best when Haze puts her pop aspirations aside and just lets it rip. Written as ""a love letter or a piece of advice to [Haze’s] mother when she was [her] age,"" the ferocious ""Black Dahlia"" has a pointed intensity and features some of the most impressive rapping on the album. And though ""Black Synagogue"" doesn’t bring the heat for its full seven minutes (like many of these songs, it’s bogged down by one too many painfully stiff spoken word snippets), Haze taps into a raw nerve as she explores her ambivalence about her Pentecostal past. <i>Dirty Gold</i> is a relentless, often exhausting listen—but tacked onto the end of the hour-plus deluxe edition there’s a taunting reminder of what else Haze can do. Though (or maybe<i> because</i>) it doesn’t aspire to any grand statements, <i>Reservation</i>’s menacingly hushed, effortlessly cool ""New York"" remains the most persuasive sermon she’s delivered.</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to the leak <i>Dirty Gold</i>, Haze unveiled a project called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52644-listen-angel-haze-freestyles-over-kanye-wests-black-skinhead/"">30 Gold</a>, which found her covering and freestyling over a different popular song each day for a month. Even though she was rapping over other people’s beats, this project revealed more about who Angel Haze is than the limited confines of her proper debut. Her verse over ""Black Skinhead"" showed how arresting her flow can be when she’s given an innovative beat; her autobiographical revision of Macklemore’s ""Same Love"" was much more stirring than the original; even her acoustic cover of Miley Cyrus’s ""Wrecking Ball"" unveiled a grit in her singing voice that <i>Dirty Gold</i>’s production scrubs too clean. All of this (along with her dissatisfaction with the way this record was handled) seems to promise that whatever Haze does next will be more in keeping with her own eccentricities. ""Now you can sing about me,"" she proclaims on the opening track, but too often <i>Dirty Gold </i>leaves you wondering how the tune of that one goes.</p></div>"|18876.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18876-angel-haze-dirty-gold/|5.9|Lindsay Zoladz

Before the so-called “emo revival” became widely reported on in 2013, frontman Patrick Kindlon and crew had already rekindled the cathartic desperation of Fugazi’s two primary predecessors in the mid-80s, Rites of Spring and Embrace (“End of a Year” being a song by the latter). Emo never really went away—but with End of a Year, it finally came full circle. Kindlon, though, was just as apt to mix black humor, jarring turns of phrase, and pop-culture references into the band’s otherwise open-hearted hardcore. End of a Year’s gradual evolution into Self Defense Family has given Kindlon even more room to stray from emo fundamentalism—and on Self Defense’s official full-length debut, <i>Try Me</i>, stray he does.</p>
<p>So does the group as a whole. Although most tracks on <i>Try Me </i>are taut and concise, they’re built around churning, sprawling riffs that feel far larger than the songs that contain them. On “Tithe Pig” and “Turn The Fan On”, an atmospheric circularity creeps along, and that lurching, mesmeric sameness hits its apotheosis on “Dingo Fence”, 10 minutes of spiraled repetition that recall the ringing, primordial drone of another Dischord Records legend, Lungfish. But this is music for disrupting trances, not inducing them. “All the dumb cocks, they get what they want,” Kindlon chants with ever-increasing belligerence throughout most of “Dingo Fence”—until he replaces “cocks” with “cunts,” and then ultimately “cops.” His voice is a raw, blunt bark, except for when it drops into a deceptively intimate lull.</p>
<p>The problem with “Dingo Fence” is its intro. During a too-long intro, Kindlon includes what seems like an impromptu, spoken-word studio rant that dwells on his choice of cock, cunt, and cop that soon appears in the song itself. Flippant and dismissive, Kindlon debates how each word choice might be construed before concluding that “I don’t have a preference. I really don’t. I could give a fuck.” It demystifies the song before it even has a chance to kick in—like watching the director’s commentary before seeing the film—and even if that’s the intention, it drains <i>Try Me</i>’s crowning moments of  much of their power. It’s a wise-ass move more suited to Kindlon’s noise-punk side-project Drug Church, whose 2013 debut <i>Paul Walker</i>—released months before the actor’s fatal car wreck—works better as a spasm of self-deconstruction.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on <i>Try Me</i>, Self Defense locks into a more focused, if no less corrosive, groove. “Nail House Music” is the album’s high point, a lunging, stomping anti-anthem that draws as much from the pulse of Lifter Puller and Wilderness as it does Fugazi. (Kindlon’s refrain of “I found you in the witch elm/ Who put you in the witch elm?” is strongly reminiscent of Guy Picciotto’s “Out of the ashtray/ Into the ashtray” from Fugazi’s “Runaway Return”.) As he’s done on past releases, Kindlon cedes the mic entirely to singer Caroline Corrigan; “Mistress Appears at a Funeral” is a shadowy tale of infidelity framed in Corrigan’s muted, melodic vocals and a gently tense instrumental. And on the mournful “Apport Birds,” backup singer Kai Stone offsets Kindlon’s choppy, vein-popping philosophizing with breathy whispers.</p>
<p><i>Try Me</i>’s biggest hurdles aren’t musical—in fact, they’re the absence of music. Clocking in at a combined 39 minutes, the tracks “Angelique One” and “Angelique Two” comprise an interview Kindlon conducted with veteran porn star Jeanna Fine. Kindlon has been upfront about his reasons for splicing these lengthy tracks into the album—foremost among them, his use of Fine’s erotic photos as masturbatory fuel in his youth. <a href=""http://www.punknews.org/article/43009/patrick-kindlon-end-of-a-yearself-defense-family-talks-sexism"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In the past</a>, he’s been just as open about his views on sex workers, sexism, and the state of free discourse about such contentious topics in the punk scene. Being confrontational and contrarian is still a part of that discourse for Kindlon, and he walks the walk with “Angelique”. Taken alone, it’s a solid piece of Studs Terkel-esque reportage in which Fine is given free rein to tell the gripping story of her life and experiences in porn. But it imbalances the album, to the point where it’s more of a distraction than an invitation, which is a disservice to Fine’s harrowing narrative. At the same time, it’s a bold move, one of many on <i>Try Me</i>. That they don’t always pay off only makes it that much braver—and that much more of a welcome deviation from the post-hardcore playbook.</p></div>"|18873.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18873-self-defense-family-try-me/|7.2|Jason Heller

The record, after all, is GM003, or the imprint’s third title. It follows only two short Big Business releases, 2011’s four-song <a href=""http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2011/07/new_big_busines.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Quadruple Single</i></a> and a subsequent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14125-battlefields/"" target=""_blank"">seven-inch single</a>. But last October, with a <a href=""http://bigbigbusiness.com/news/gold-metal-records-press-release-10-18-2013-big-business-official-preorder-release-notice"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mock press release</a> signed by Gold Metal “corporate controller” Richard Smutley and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2doplSg_qQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a staged press conference submitted</a> to YouTube, Big Business revealed that they’d issue <i>Battlefields Forever </i>on Halloween<i> </i>on their own Gold Metal Records in a variety of formats—that is, by themselves, without the support of a third or even second party. They’d stream and sell it through their website.</p>
<p>Both announcements were as funny as intended, with jokes about Mötley Crüe drumming and the ghost of “Jeff Goldbloom.” Behind the jocularity, though, there was a fundamental bummer: If Big Business didn’t want to go hunting labels or, in industry parlance, “shopping themselves around,” they would have to release <i>Battlefields Forever </i>themselves. Their label for their entire career, Hydra Head, announced its closure almost exactly a year earlier, citing both an “imbalance between creative ideals and financial realities” and an asymptotic slide of music sales as primary factors. Suddenly, the force that had done the heavy lifting behind Big Business’s promotion—the mailings and the CD-R’s, the one-sheets and the stuffed envelopes—had fallen, with the responsibility now landed at the feet of the band.</p>
<p>In retrospect, that has not gone well. <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=big+business+battlefields+forever+review&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A quick Google search</a> confirms that drummer Coady Willis, bassist Jared Warren, and new guitarist Scott Martin’s are better at making records than marketing them. Though <i>Battlefields Forever</i> was released nearly four months ago, All Music has <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/artist/big-business-mn0000667210"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">yet to list it</a>, much less rate it. <i>Spin </i>has <a href=""http://www.spin.com/search/node/battlefields%252520forever"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">never</a> mentioned it. The album made nearly no year-end lists, despite being out since Halloween. And after the annual flip of the calendar, Pitchfork is finally reviewing it. For a platform that seems to hold almost everything, the internet has nearly made <i>Battlefields Forever</i> seem like a phantom, a rumor that Big Business is still busy.</p>
<p>That disappearance is especially unfortunate considering that <i>Battlefields Forever</i> is as likable and unpredictable as anything they’ve ever done. Willis and Warren have never zigged and zagged stylistically like the Melvins, the other duo they’ve augmented off and on for the last six years, but there’s a patient and patent idiosyncrasy to their sound. No matter how familiar their oversized riffs or refrains first seem, they twist and turn in unexpected ways. On <i>Battlefields Forever</i>, for instance, Martin’s guitar delivers surprising accents and counterpoints. “Heavy Shoes” emerges from a slow bleed of amplifier hum, drums, and voices sprinting suddenly into vivid crisscross patterns. Warren’s low notes are the anchor, but Martin wraps his thin electric lead around the bass, an ornamental leather braid around a very big wooden bludgeon. The wonderfully weird “Trees” starts to feel like a hypothetical game of three-way ping-pong, with various voices bouncing through the mix only to be chased by the instruments. The band starts and stops, roars and drifts, screams and sings, delighting all along with the structural instability of the song’s basic shape. There’s a coruscating instrumental interlude named “Aurum” and a two-minute ripper called “Our Mutant” that suggests stoner metal accelerated by methamphetamine. And “No Vowels” is something of a Big Business prototype, with a riff so wide you want to fall into it and a chorus so casually perfect that it catches without you paying much mind. </p>
<p>But Big Business save the most monumental track here for he parting epic: “Lonely Lyle” shares the story of a shut-in with no intentions of breaking from his fastidious “hourglass.” It starts quietly, voices creeping over chords that suggest Slint. When the drums arrive, though, the song becomes a surge of drama, turning another silly Big Business story into a wake for its own sad subject. Martin chases their lead, inserting his lines between the bass and the drums like a hypeman. This band has never sounded as tough <i>and </i>as<i> </i>tender. Strangely, it suggests the approach and net effect of Deafheaven’s <i>Sunbather</i>, another not-quite-metal record that employed song volume and length to reinforce the weight of their themes. In 2013, “Lonely Lyle” could have had its deserved share of critical and popular company. But, so far, it hasn’t had that public luxury.</p>
<p>Big Business’ last record, 2009’s <i>Mind the Drift</i>, included a paranoid jam called “I Got It Online”. The guitars felt like the wringing of anxious hands. The lyrics—“Can’t even walk down the street/ Too many creeps”—suggested an agoraphobic sort excommunicating himself from the world with the help of Amazon, ebay or, as it turns out in the case of <i>Battlefields Forever</i>, Bandcamp. The online release and subsequently silent reception of these nine tracks makes me think that maybe the democracy of the online marketplace might not serve everyone so well, particularly mid-level metal bands with a sense of humor so strong that they cannot announce their first LP in four years with a straight face. For a young act, throwing the new tunes on the internet and seeing who bites seems like a dandy strategy; what do you have to lose, really? But Big Business isn’t some young band and, despite Martin’s inclusion, <i>Battlefields Forever </i>isn’t some staggering reinvention of what they’ve been doing for the last decade. It’s just a very good record that seems to have been ignored because it had neither the proper label structure to let people even know it existed and, for shame, because its narrative doesn’t fit into the cycles of buzz. Unless you were a devotee of Big Business before last year, you probably still don’t know Gold Metal Records, or worse still, <i>Battlefields Forever</i>. You can always, at least, get it online.   </p></div>"|18809.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18809-big-business-battlefields-forever/|8.0|Grayson Haver Currin

It's a phone video shot vertically, which means the drummer is hidden by black borders. The sound quality isn't great, but you can see Baltimore teenager Drew Owen hunched over his guitar, screaming and churning through some power chords. It's not a thrilling performance, per se—two dudes bashing through some elemental punk rock with less-than-tight drumming and caveman vocals that seem to loosely ape Timmy Vulgar's. But if you listen carefully to the screams coming through the iPhone's microphone, it's clear that there's something ferocious and exciting in this music. <i>Terminal Teen Age</i>, the full-length debut album recorded solely by Owen, takes that raw material and delivers it with force.</p>
<p>The LP is a batch of scuzzy, furious, shit-fi punk rock that arrives at an opportune time. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31293-the-oblivians/"">Oblivians</a> have <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18095-the-oblivians-desperation/"">grown up</a>, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29598-the-reatards/"">Reatards</a> are gone, and just before they offered a strong <a href=""http://thirdmanstore.com/featured/the-shaw-tapes-live-in-detroit-5-27-88"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reminder of their heydey</a>, members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7766-the-gories/"">the Gories</a> released a straight-faced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18605-the-dirtbombs-ooey-gooey-chewy-ka-blooey/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">bubblegum album</a>. Now all of a sudden, here's a potent batch of aggro punk from a teenager in Baltimore—under 30 minutes of screaming rock'n'roll with energy that invokes the wide-eyed intensity of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15475-teenage-hate/""><i>Teenage Hate</i></a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Food_(Oblivians_album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Soul Food</i></a>, and <i><a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Gories-Houserockin/release/2767775"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Houserockin'</a>. </i>Every track features simple, catchy power chord hooks blown out by fuzz. The drums are overwhelmingly belligerent. At the exact moment when each of Owen's two-minute songs start to feel repetitive, he busts out an impressive guitar solo to put some space between the four-word choruses and unintelligible vocals. When phrases pop out from the fray of noise, they're always cartoonishly negative (On ""Strungout"", for example, he screams ""nothing's left"" and grunts ""please give me death"").</p>
<p>Since Owen's a teenager, and since his album is called <i>Terminal Teen Age</i>, it's easy to infer a few conflicted teenaged narratives from his belligerent negativity. ""I peaked in high school"" is an obvious one, but there are other tracks here that would've been thematically perfect for playing at full blast while I drove out of the high school parking lot in my dad's old Corolla. The ""NO NO NO NO NO"" chorus from ""Can't Take No More"" pretty well embodies the petty frustrations that come from feeling like an adult and being consistently treated like a child. ""Last Day in Hell"", with its scowling vocals and Sabbath-reminiscent guitar solo, is an ideal mantra for kicking off summer break. The tangled emotional realities of teenaged life are also covered by ""Fucked Up Feelings"" and ""I Want Out"". And of course, there's the blind fury of ""Blood Red"". </p>
<p>But the real draw here are Owen's beefy earworm melodies. The gawking teenage lust story in ""Fifteen Minute Love"" is backed by an entirely catchy power chord barrage. ""Getting Real Alone"" steps away from his usual power chord-centric attack for a prominent blues riff. And while the album's strongest moments come from Owen's loud-and-fast scorched earth approach, he also finds some time to cool down. The pace of ""Ain't Nothing to See"" begins with a gradual simmer, but naturally, he eventually kicks up a frenzy of guitar heroics.</p>
<p><i>Terminal Teen Age</i> consistently teeters on the edge of oblivion, and not just because that's the narrative Owen consistently presents in these 13 tracks. Things consistently threaten to fall apart or become overbearing. Thankfully, he's a student of garage punk's greats, so he knows when to keep things concise and when to force a track into a full, sudden stop. It's an exciting, impressive debut from Owen. Though his Sick Thoughts Bandcamp has been shut down for some reason, on December 27, he recorded and immediately released <a href=""https://caught666.bandcamp.com/album/the-funeral"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">a metal record</a> under the name Caught—his fourth in two months. Garage punk is a prolific man's game. With bug-eyed weirdness, screaming intensity, and a seemingly effortless knack for crafting hooks, Owen is definitely poised to join the prolific weirdo fold.</p></div>"|18829.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18829-sick-thoughts-terminal-teen-age/|7.7|Evan Minsker

You never know what you’re getting until you see a tracklist. When New York Native Tongue veterans <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3499-q-tip/"" target=""_blank"">Q-Tip</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/514-busta-rhymes/"" target=""_blank"">Busta Rhymes </a>dropped the loping disco romp “Thank You” late last year and announced the impending release of the collaborative mixtape <i>The Abstract and the Dragon</i>, the impression among breathless fans was that the pair were finally teaming up for a full project. When the mixtape arrived, of course, that rumor was promptly put to rest. <i>The Abstract and the Dragon </i>isn’t the surprise collection of new material we’d hoped for; it’s more a travelogue of a friendship well into its third decade, a Busta and Q-Tip greatest hits collection compiled by hip-hop journalist Shaheem Reid.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Most of the duo’s legendary pow-wows are present, from the inaugural Leaders of the New School &amp; Tribe Called Quest posse cut “Scenario” to select tracks from their solo careers (“Ill Vibe” from Busta’s debut solo album <i>The Coming</i>, <i>The Big Bang</i>’s new jack rebuke “You Can’t Hold the Torch”, the remix to Q-Tip’s breakout solo single “Viv’rant Thing”). Tying it all together is a series of affable skits featuring Busta, Q-Tip and friends shooting the shit and telling stories behind the songs, like when Busta recounts his reluctance to repeat “Scenario”’s “Rawr rawr like a dungeon dragon” shpiel on Big Daddy Kane’s 1991 “Come On Down”, a big get for him and Q-Tip at the time, only to tack it on after Kane hears his verse and asks “Where the ‘rawr rawr’ at?” The song selection hews a little obscure; lesser known fare like Tribe’s <i>Rhyme &amp; Reason </i>soundtrack spot “Wild Hot”, and “For the Nasty”, a Neptunes collaboration from the <i>NBA Live ‘06</i> soundtrack, appear, but beloved singles Tribe’s “Oh My God” (which samples Busta’s “Scenario” verse) and the Fugees, Tribe &amp; Busta posse cut “Rumble in the Jungle” do not. But the real draw here is <i>The Abstract and the Dragon</i>’s smattering of exclusives.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Scattered throughout the playlist here are a handful of brand new Busta and Q-Tip recordings and revised takes on classics. Alongside “Thank You”, here remixed by Kid Capri, there’s the follow-up tandem cut “Butch &amp; Sundance”. We also get the mixtape’s title track, a snippet of a new song from Busta’s upcoming <i>E.L.E. 2</i> album, and “We Taking Off”, all Busta spotlights with Q-Tip handling production. Elsewhere <i>E.L.E.</i> DJ Scratch remixes “Gettin’ Up” from Q-Tip’s <i>The Renaissance</i>, and Busta appends a verse to Tribe’s <i>Midnight Marauders </i>closer “God Lives Through”. The new cuts showcase a madcap chemistry unblemished by the passage of time, Tip’s ineffably slippery flow and beat construction anchoring Busta’s verbal gymnastics as heartily now as they did when they were teenagers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The exclusives are a welcome addition to a mix largely built out of previously released material, but they also point to the more intriguing forms <i>The Abstract and the Dragon</i> could’ve taken with a little more care. “God Lives Through”’s freestyling-over-each-other’s-deep-cuts ethos is a stroke of genius. “Gettin' Up”’s friends-remixing-our-deep-cuts tack is too. Hell, this thing could’ve just been an EP of the new songs. But <i>The Abstract and the Dragon</i> gestures to all these forms but never settles on one. It’s a good mix, but fans of either artist could probably construct the vast majority of it out of their own iTunes and will probably end up stripping the 28-song project for the six they haven’t had kicking around their record collection all these years and decades.</p></div>"|18840.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18840-busta-rhymes-q-tip-the-abstract-and-the-dragon/|6.6|Craig Jenkins

<p>Much less a comeback album than the latest reinvention from artists that have always prided themselves on new ideas, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16331-parastrophics/"" target=""_blank""><i>Parastrophics</i></a> was louder and bolder than anything they'd done before, a giggly record stuffed with bursts of color and melodies that came as close to approaching ""pop"" as 2004's disarmingly conventional <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5467-radical-connector/"" target=""_blank""><i>Radical Connector</i></a>. At the time, it seemed reasonable to draw comparisons between what Andi Toma and Jan St. Werner were doing and the lush, brutally overwhelming electronic music coming out of Glasgow, but nearly two years later, there's still nothing that quite sounds like <i>Parastrophics</i>, proof that Toma and St. Werner were still capable of forging their own pleasingly weird path more than two decades into their careers.</p>
<p>The only constant in Mouse on Mars' world is change, so what was to come after <i>Parastrophics</i> was anyone's guess. They bookended 2012 with a mini-LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17274-wow/"" target=""_blank""><i>WOW</i></a>, a charming collection of nearly-formed exercises that suggested the pair were interested in exploring the world of wonky, expressively melodic bass music that current label home Monkeytown, run by dance duo Modeselektor, is known for. In the middle of last year, St. Werner dropped a record of abstract soundscapes, <i>Blaze Colour Burn</i>, proof that he (and, possibly, Mouse on Mars by extension) hadn't lost his taste for making music that provided for ""difficult"" listening a la <i>Varcharz</i>.</p>
<p>For the shock of the new that <i>Parastrophics</i> carried (and still carries), those familiar with Toma and St. Werner's back catalog could recognize some structural similarities—moments of lake-gliding placidity, warm synth pads, jigsaw glitch textures that only artists who came to prominence in the IDM era would wield in 2012—that made the album unmistakably the work of Mouse on Mars. This reliability is part of what made <i>Parastrophics</i>' tinier idiosyncrasies so endearing, and it's what makes <i>Spezmodia</i>, their new five-track EP, so shocking. Jettisoning most of <i>Parastrophics</i>' sonic jumble for something more explicitly streamlined, the release represents one of the duo's sharpest left turns in the past decade, continuing the melodic refinement that Mouse on Mars have returned to time and again while shaping their taste for aggressive textures into new, more dancefloor-ready molds.</p>
<p>If <i>WOW</i> dipped its toes into what Mouse on Mars could do with the raw materials of bass music's current landscape, <i>Spezmodia</i> is the point of full immersion. Familiar rhythmic structures abound—the stuttered-step figure that opens the title track, the hissy acid-juke midsection of ""Bakerman Is Breaking Bad""—and the synth melodies splattered throughout carry an aggressive brightness, arriving with all the subtlety of a car driving through a storefront window. There are moments of glitch-dabbed madness that break through these deceptively dense works, but here it largely sounds like Toma and St. Werner have taken a vacuum to their off-kilter rhythms, removing the detritus that surrounds them until all that's left is a jagged, impossibly clean shell.</p>
<p><i>Spezmodia</i> also continues Mouse on Mars' experimentation with vocals—sampled and otherwise—a concern that dates back to the days of <i>Radical Connector</i>. ""I See Dizzy"" kicks open with a blood-curdling scream that's twisted into a rhythmic respiratory voice, while the astounding title track weaves an array of vocal elisions into its upward-building structure, pushing the BPM into the red until a glistening synth melody and fat bass stabs arrive to produce the aural illusion of sounds moving fast while seemingly and simultaneously slowing down. Compared to <i>Radical Connector</i>'s most straightforward moments, this material is brutally psychedelic and intense, and such boldness suits them quite well.</p>
<p>The most marvelous aspect of Mouse on Mars' resurgence is that, similar to how their music has sounded to the uninitiated over the years, it doesn't make any sense. As Mark Richardson pointed out in his review of <i>Parastrophics</i>, many of Mouse on Mars' contemporaries have long since bitten the dust, but the duo's constant quest for self-innovation has afforded them just the right amount of relevance, even when it seems like the convergence between their current path and trends in modern music is purely coincidental. They're still tinkering with their sound, and <i>Spezmodia</i> is the latest evidence that it's nearly impossible for Mouse on Mars not to make fascinating, truly exciting music.</p></div>"|18823.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18823-mouse-on-mars-spezmodia-ep/|7.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

It was the lone album that Cilio ever released, and he took his own life in 1983, at the age of 33. It’s not a casual assessment by O’Rourke, as it actually suggests the deep level of intimacy of Cilio’s sound.</p>
<p>That reissue reinforced that closeness. Originally entitled <i>Dialoghi Del Presente</i> (translation “Dialogues of the Present”) but retitled <i>Dell’Universo Assente</i> (“The Absent Universe”), it looked like a blank white cover. Only when held in your hands and inspected closely did the near-invisible cover image appear, a hand-drawn spiral in light silver ink. That CD reissue quickly disappeared, but thankfully it now receives a wider reissue some ten years on, both on CD and vinyl from the meticulous Italian label, Die Schachtel.</p>
<p>It’s hard to draw an exact parallel to Cilio’s music. O’Rourke triangulates it somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Nick Drake</a>’s <i>Pink Moon</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23481-bill-fay/"" target=""_blank"">Bill Fay</a>’s <i>Time of the Last Persecution</i> and the debut album from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9158-out-of-cold-storage/"">This Heat</a>. But in its punctilious attention to acoustic instrumentation in space, <i>Dell’Universo Assente</i> comes closest to approximating what the next Mark Hollis album might have sounded like, had Hollis continued along <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15957-laughing-stock-mark-hollis/""><i>Laughing Stock</i>’s and his 1998 self-titled album’s</a> trajectory, moving away from words and song, ever closer to a distilled sound couched in silence. The effect of Cilio’s music reminds me of Jess Harvell’s line in the above review, stating “how startling, isolated moments of sound, or a formless wash of sound, can wring emotions out of listeners as powerfully as any conventional melody.”</p>
<p>Born in Naples, Cilio studied architecture and music, learned sitar, guitar, and piano yet was essentially a self-taught composer that interacted with progressive rock and experimental theater in early 70s Italy before realizing this, his lone album. Arranged in four movements with an interlude, scored for acoustic guitar, mandolin, strings, piano, woodwinds and percussion, the album is wordless, yet features a lone instance of voice to devastating effect.</p>
<p>The “prima quadro” clocks in near eight minutes, opening with a bittersweet finger-picked guitar figure that—as it slips into a minor key—finds itself shadowed, first by piano, then soon after by cello and string quartet. Fans of Rachel’s or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4274-englaborn/"">the first Jóhann Jóhannsson album</a> might immediately swoon. But as the strings explore the minor key, near the 2:30 mark, Cilio cagily swaps out the timbre of the bowed cello with Patrizia Lopez’s voice, multi-tracking her until she creates a spine-chilling chorus. At 3:50, Cilio performs yet another aural hallucination, as the female vocal then transmogrifies into a soprano saxophone line. Two minutes after her entrance, Lopez's voice disappears completely; without a single word uttered, body-leveling emotions are nevertheless conveyed.</p>
<p>The second movement puts the woodwinds in a subterranean setting, prepared percussion flitting around the flute, oboe and soprano sax, the string section entering to push everything deeper into the gloom. A lightness appears courtesy of an elegant and lyrical two-minute piano solo that comprises the third movement, while the fourth movement opens with tuned percussion before saxophone enters, reminiscent of a restrained free jazz section, building up speed with the introduction of guitar and other woodwinds. Cilio’s crystalline finger-picked guitar returns for the “Interludio,” as gorgeous a melody as Robbie Basho or John Fahey plucked, if taken at a slower pace. Cello and woodwinds also arise, but the album soon distills back to Cilio’s lone guitar for the end.</p>
<p>As one might expect that with a title like “The Absent Universe,” it’s a spare album, its pleasures revealed through careful listening rather than quick snippets, but not a single note or gesture feels out of place. And in recapping the juxtapose of instrumentation, it feels like something is still lacking, that the deep, solemn unnameable emotions conjure by Cilio –which in hindsight feels sorrowful, knowing that this would be his lone statement into such a universe– are scarcely touched upon. Perhaps that is what O’Rourke’s above quote signifies: a sound so intimate as to have not been recorded and pressed to disc, but instead pulled from the subconscious, transmitted instead to each listener individually. Later in the notes, Jim O’Rourke writes of the music as feeling like “this enormous weight that is bearing on its creators, the absolute need to exorcize it from their lives.” Cilio is a heavy listen, but one that can ultimately feel redemptive.</p></div>"|18845.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18845-luciano-cilio-delluniverso-assente/|8.4|Andy Beta

Take Lefty Frizzell’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2x0fMszj58"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1950 classic “If You’ve Got the Money, I’ve Got the Time”</a>. In its original format, it was a bare bones country standard typical of the Grand Ole Opry’s golden age: fiddle, pedal steel, Lefty’s voice, and not much else. Then, in 1959, he released a new, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3KbMo45yzE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">re-recorded version</a> of the song on <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Lefty-Frizzell-The-One-And-Only-Lefty-Frizzell/release/3749375"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The One and Only Lefty Frizzell</i></a>. It sounded overtly glossy thanks in part to a saccharine choir of backup vocalists. The additional voices added needless commercial sheen, only serving to mar and obscure the original’s charm.  </p>
<p>Tim Cohen wrote the songs from <i>River of Souls</i> with backup singers in mind. He’s said that the only thing that separates his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29813-magic-trick/"">Magic Trick</a> material from his work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28104-the-fresh-onlys/"">the Fresh &amp; Onlys</a> are the two bands’ personnel. And he’s not overstuffing his latest album with a full chorus; he works with two female vocalists: Noelle Cahill and Alicia Vanden Heuvel. They provide this album’s primary appeal—Cohen’s baritone counterbalanced by two soft female voices. Sure, he could’ve handed “The Store” over to Wymond Miles, Kyle Gibson, and Shayde Sartin, but by using Cahill and Heuvel’s voices instead, the song’s guitar-centric momentum is somewhat softened. And ultimately, this is a very soft, easily handled album. The idea isn’t to add rough edges; just beauty and sheen.</p>
<p>The lead guitars on the album provided by Tom Heyman often stay clear of any raw, ragged garage punk sounds in favor of a tone more similar to Mark Knopfler’s. There are tambourines and unassuming melodies. As Cohen sings “Come Inside”, the backup vocalists come through with a mild, warm echo. This music is meant to be pleasant and palatable, so with that songwriting goal in mind, the additional voices are well-suited to the material.</p>
<p>But for an album that’s already plenty smooth, Cohen goes all in with his lyrics. The album title <i>River of Souls</i> does nothing to steer the listener away from the words “adult contemporary.” It’s close enough in name to Billy Joel’s 1993 album <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_of_Dreams"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>River of Dreams </i></a>and <i>is</i> the name of a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/River-Souls-Dan-Fogelberg/dp/B0000027FN"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1993 Dan Fogelberg album</a>. And the song’s messages consistently lean toward the theatrical. On “You Have to Do”, over a languid organ and some “doo-wahhh” harmonies, Cohen offers a bunch of “wisdom” regarding how a man should keep a woman happy. It plays almost like a scene in a mid-20th century musical: A man, intimidated by his love for a woman, asks his wise friend/brother/father for advice. Then, the savvy narrator (Cohen) sings about how his friend should take action, and of course, two women wander into the frame just in time to sing some well-placed harmonies over his instructions.</p>
<p>With buoyant synths on “Salvation”, with Cohen’s soft moan and the echoing harmonica of “Beloved One”, <i>River of Souls</i> is breezy listening. Right when things start to get a little more bold with the soulful stomp, harmonies, and horns of “My World”, the song dissipates into a puddle of meandering guitars that aim for freeform but wind up feeling more like hotel lobby music. “We like pretty girls,” Cahill and Heuvel airily sing on “Crazy Teeth” over a continuous mid-tempo shuffle that would feel aesthetically appropriate in a transitional “riding from one town to the next” scene of an old western movie. It’s not a <i>cool</i> sounding album by any stretch, but even in the canon of dad rock, it doesn’t stand up. The songs become repetitive, and though the harmonies are well-crafted and the melodies are lovely, there aren’t enough moments that demand attention. After a while, all the sounds on <i>River of Souls</i> run together, a little bland and verging on formless.</p></div>"|18841.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18841-magic-trick-river-of-souls/|6.3|Evan Minsker

But on his new album <i>Dr. Stokley</i>, Perkins isn't indulging in rap orthodoxy over funk-infused instrumentals (a specialty of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30324-odd-future/"" target=""_blank"">Odd Future</a> camp and fellow third-eye devotees <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31049-the-underachievers/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">The Underachievers</a>.) Nor is he interested in the kind of soft-funk odyssey that we saw with Snoop Dogg and Dam-Funk's recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18801-7-days-of-funk-7-days-of-funk/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank""><i>7 Days of Funk</i></a>. The new album, <i>Dr. Stokley</i>, devoid as it is of both irony and traditional rapping, is an entirely separate thing.</p>
<p><i>Dr. Stokley</i> represents a synthesis of Perkins’ career, combining his relatively grounded (and undercooked) early days as the rapper Declaime with the funk, soul, and afrocentric mysticism that he’s embraced in his later years.  The styles combine into a kind of loose declaratory spoken word, a free associative style that often frustrates. Dudley makes many false claims of flow fluency on the album, boasting of a nonexistent rap superiority that can be grating. But when he embraces his stranger sensibilities, it can result in wonderfully left-field songs. ""Geriatrics"" is the best example here, a track that finds Dudley imagining the ideal life as a senior, rapping about being an “Old coot, sipping on prune juice in my best Sunday suit.”  It’s the kind of song that you simply will not find anywhere else, and one of the few reasons to embrace Perkins’ notion of lyricism on its own terms.</p>
<p>That he can remain outside the box even when his influences are in vogue speaks to just how unique a figure Perkins is.  His prominence comes thanks to the 2004 one-off “Flowers"", an acid-drenched soul single delivered over primo production from fellow Oxnard, Ca. native <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Madlib</a> (<span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">whose production is featured on the<i> Stokley </i>standout, ""State of Emergency."")</span>.  Perkins has refused to fade into the history of musical oddities; on the strength of prolificacy and consistently excellent production he has stayed marginally relevant, even as his contributions to his own music become less and less notable.</p>
<p>The real reason to tune into <i>Dr. Stokley </i>are the beats of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4763-georgia-anne-muldrow/"" target=""_blank"">Georgia Anne Muldrow</a>, Perkins’ artistic soul mate and life partner and the true talent of the collaborative duo.  Muldrow’s 2012 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16416-georgia-anne-muldrow-seeds/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><i>Seeds</i></a><i>, </i>was badly slept on, a worthy cousin of Erykah Badu’s <i>New Amerykah </i>series<i>. </i>It’s clear that Muldrow has taken the lessons she gleaned working with Madlib on that album to new heights on <i>Dr. Stokley</i>.  Her beats are high-fidelity, expertly produced instrumental hip-hop, with hard-edged production that’s occasionally softened when she sings quietly below Perkins’ sermons.  On “Episode” drum snaps meet with the ghosts of soul samples and Muldrow’s own cooing—the beat makes the meat and potatoes gangster story of the track come alive.</p>
<p>Perkins and Muldrow have struggled with multiple setbacks in the past few years including financial issues, Perkins being deported from Canada in the midst of a tour, a home robbery and a long-standing beef with former label Stones Throw, which Perkins has long-insisted owes him money.  Those doses of reality may have affected the cloud-dwelling duo in different ways.  The grit of Muldrow’s latest crop of beats grounds her ethereal style nicely.  But Perkins is better the stranger he is; when he lashes out at rivals or an unforgiving world he comes off as petty, rather than righteous. On “Rhythmic Procedures,” for instance, he blasts others for violence, hate and consumerism, without ever really delving into the meat of the problems he’s addressing. His complaints begin to loop back on one another, becoming obnoxiously repetitive. </p>
<p>Perkins and Muldrow are both releasing music through Mello Music Group now, an indie label whose flagship artist, the DC producer/rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30467-oddisee/"" target=""_blank"">Oddisee</a> helps classify their sound, as a kind of crunchy, east coast alternative to Stones Throw.  The label’s investment in Perkins is worthwhile, if only to get at Muldrow. The instrumental album of <i>Dr. Stokley </i>might have stood as one of the better beat tapes of last year. But Dudley’s presence above the noise makes for a confused and ultimately less satisfying record.</p></div>"|18872.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18872-dudley-perkins-dr-stokley/|5.8|Jonah Bromwich

The suburban New Jersey producer, who's toiled away in earnest for several years now as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a>, emerged in 2011 with a cinematic, handcrafted sound that possessed a glowing radiance despite its density. What Volpe was doing felt, especially in the realm of hip-hop, <i>new</i>—a word that the genre's prized as a perpetual goal since DJs started siphoning the energy of New York City streets for block parties. Hip-hop took notice.</p>
<p>You can hear the ghostly, amniotic thrum of Clams Casino's style in the strongest work by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> and Noah ""40"" Shebib, two artists who made one of the only albums to sell more than a million copies in the U.S. last year. UK producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30208-evian-christ/"" target=""_blank"">Evian Christ</a>, first heard as the latest in a legion of bedroom producers to ride Volpe's coattails, was one of the many cooks in the kitchen that brewed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a>'s energizing latest LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yeezus</i></a>, where the fuzzy belches and moaning yawps associated with the strongest Clams Casino material ripped the sky open on the sex-drenched, electric ""I'm In It"". (The wave of Clams Casino imitators was once at such a high tide that an entire genre was formed out of the lazily drawn, tab-tripping micro-phenomenon that followed—""cloud rap""—but like so many cultural fads in the internet age, its prevalence was mercifully brief.)</p>
<p>Volpe first gained recognition producing tracks for impressionistic rapper-turned-Tony Robbins-type <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"" target=""_blank"">Lil B</a>, but the artist that's most closely aligned himself with the Clams Casino sound is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a>, who drenched himself in Volpe's sticky fog for his star-making 2011 mixtape <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16026-liveloveaap/"" target=""_blank""><i>LIVELOVEA$AP</i></a>. An artist who's expressed ambition despite possessing particularly unshowy skills as a rapper, Rocky has proven himself adept at capturing the zeitgeist with the eager eyes of a child trapping lightning bugs in a jar. So even though his alignment with Volpe's star was well-timed, it was unsurprising to see the Harlem rapper set his eyes on bigger prizes for last year's major label debut <i>LongLiveA$AP</i>.</p>
<p>The ""big songs"" from that album still possessed the same slightly woozy, off-center charm that Volpe had previously lent Rocky's music, but the credits behind those sounds—Hit-Boy, Skrillex, Shebib—weren't Volpe's. Some may interpret this development as bigger producers ripping off one of the decade's most fascinating sonic developments in underground hip-hop, but the truth is more straightforward. Like Lex Luger and many others before him, Volpe came, saw, innovated, permeated, and was appropriated until his and the genre's sonic DNA were more or less one. The lifespan of new sounds in hip-hop is incongruous and more often than not brutally curt towards its creators, but bemoaning it is a waste of time. This is simply how things work.</p>
<p>Regardless, Clams Casino's presence has far from diminished, especially in Rocky's case: his production credit appeared on two, admittedly minor <i>LongLiveA$AP</i> songs—""LVL"" and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27635-santigold/"" target=""_blank"">Santigold</a>-featuring ""Hell""—which appear in instrumental form on Volpe's third instrumental mixtape in three years, released for free on Twitter just before 2013 came to a close. The central talking point around Clams Casino beats has been that they tend to sound even better without the rappers that were originally featured on them, and that's no different here: ""LVL"" and ""Hell"" represent Volpe in his element, with his trademark mix of dramatic percussive touches and distorted melodic crescendos coming together potently.</p>
<p>The A$AP brand appears once more on <i>Instrumental Mixtape 3</i>: the gaping instrumental for ""Freeze"", an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30605-aap-mob/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Mob</a> posse cut featuring Jim Jones that appeared on 2012's roughshod mixtape <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17070-lords-never-worry/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lords Never Worry</i></a>. The second and previous installment in Volpe's instrumental mixtape series was arguably his strongest and most congruent, as well as the most reliant on the A$AP brand's involvement. As Rocky's star rises, it's unclear if the creative connection between his crew and Volpe will continue—on A$AP Mob member Ferg's 2013 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17921-aap-ferg-trap-lord/"" target=""_blank""><i>Trap Lord</i></a>, the latter was nowhere to be found—but the connection clearly yields success, as the A$AP-associated cuts on <i>Instrumental Mixtape 3</i> are the strongest and most impressive, most Clams-esque, of the bunch.</p>
<p>The other non-originals that make up <i>Instrumental Mixtape 3</i> suggest that Volpe spent most of 2013, if not laying low, then slightly receding from the hip-hop world. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">In our Rising interview in 2011</a>, he bemoaned that ""the beats just sit around for months"" when he works with other artists; considering that issue is magnified in the upper echelon of hip-hop, it's safe to assume that there's Clams Casino productions out there that we haven't heard, and may never hear.) There are a few beats for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30111-mac-miller/"" target=""_blank"">Mac Miller</a>, two of which appeared on last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18202-mac-miller-watching-movies-with-the-sound-off/"" target=""_blank""><i>Watching Movies With the Sound Off</i></a>, and a beat ripped from a collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27670-doom/"" target=""_blank"">DOOM</a>; save for the twinkling, uh, euphoria of ""Youforia"", these productions are minor works in the Clams Casino oeuvre, slight and thinly developed detours not dissimilar to the low points of the first <i>Instrumental Mixtape</i>, when Volpe's sound was still crystallizing.</p>
<p>Speaking of: ""Crystals"", taken from the soundtrack to the mega-popular video game <i>Grand Theft Auto V</i>, structures its decay around an arpeggiated synth nearly identical to the one that pops up in Burial's ""Loner"". ""Pull Me Down"", a co-production with alt-R&amp;B also-ran <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30854-mykki-ekko/"" target=""_blank"">Mikky Ekko</a> (aka the <i>other</i> voice in Rihanna's treacly, ubiquitous ballad ""Stay""), fares much better, as an easy beat and lightly plunked piano keys give way to a languid guitar line that adds a lovely, aqueous touch to the instrumental's final third.</p>
<p>Alongside an upbeat re-do of Volpe's contribution to 2011's forgettable Adult Swim Singles Program contribution ""Wizard"", there are three previously unreleased Clams Casino solo productions here, one of which proves to be a keeper: ""Cry for Me"", with a pounding rhythm and vocal sample that trips over itself amidst off-kilter synths and a sample of what sounds like children screaming. The track's reminiscent of his ebullient beat for Lil B's ""Unchain Me"" that appeared on the previous <i>Instrumental Mixtape</i> installment; that collection also contained his greatest beat to date, ""I'm God"", and although the highlights on this installment are impressive, the lack of a ""big track"" along with a slightly higher duds-to-keepers ratio ultimately make it the weakest of the three collections.</p>
<p>Upon the release of <i>Instrumental Mixtape 3</i>, Volpe took to Twitter to announce that it would be the last installment in the series, and that's probably for the best. It's been nearly three years since he released a solo outing as Clams Casino, the impressive Tri Angle-released <i>Rainforest</i> EP, and perhaps an increased focus in developing his sound without worrying about submitting tracks to rappers would yield more of the creativity that made listeners sit up and take notice from the beginning. Nonetheless, the strongest moments of <i>Instrumental Mixtape 3</i> confirm that Volpe is in complete possession of his own sound for him to do with it what he sees fit.</p></div>"|18830.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18830-clams-casino-instrumental-tape-3/|7.2|Larry Fitzmaurice

Even from the beginning of Chicago’s rap renaissance, he was slightly off of the scene’s center—older than the GBE teenagers and with lyrics that were far more knotty and playful than what came to be classified as drill music. The new face of the city is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"" target=""_blank"">Chance the Rapper</a>, and the sound of the underground is “bop,” ringtone rap’s super-pop third wave. King L has splashed around in the bop scene, but as his new mixtape <i>Drilluminati 2</i> emphasizes his music is very self-contained. <br/><br/>It is perhaps a testament to Louie that this remains true even after his starring turn on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yeezus</i></a>, where he handles the opening verse and hook of the shrieking “Send It Up"". It was never expected that popping up on Kanye’s most unforgiving album would materially change the music of the man who helped influence its sound, but <i>Drilluminati 2</i> is also reminder of how much of Louie’s essence was contained in just that one feature. “Send it Up” is evidence of his sharp eye for concepts: “We can send this bitch up, it can’t go down” is not precisely a revelation but in its simple, brain-burrowing sloganeering it almost feels like one. It is the type of memorable line that seems to sprout up almost at random from Louie’s tangled flows— “Tattoos how they break the news,” from the same song, is another. <br/><br/>The best of <i>Drilluminati 2</i> extends that formula. The strongest track is “I Might"", which cycles through the same concept as if the song is one long hook: “I might rock the Rollie, I might rock the Breitling/ I might cop the foreign and don’t even drive it.” Another is “Terrific"", which positions the ephemera of Louie’s life as the song’s title. This sort of songwriting is the province of someone like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"" target=""_blank"">Gucci Mane</a> and most recently <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"" target=""_blank"">Future</a>, who is now a superstar thanks in part to his ability to push an idea (“you ain’t even know it,” “I’m just being honest”) to its logical extreme. Louie is not yet on that level, but on <i>Drilluminati 2</i> he once again displays an ability to come up with these little thoughts that end up rattling around in your brain.<br/><br/>Maybe it’s no surprise then that the tape’s biggest misstep is “Tony"", a blatant rip-off of Future’s own “Tony Montana"". Louie, too, raps in a bastardized version of the Cuban gangster’s sneering accent, and while it is an example of his willingness to experiment with his delivery it’s much too similar to a song that is already another rapper’s calling card. It’s the only track here that is outright regrettable, but over<i> Drilluminati 2</i>’s 13 tracks there are only a select few that really stand out.<br/><br/>One of those is “O.D.B.” and its anti-gravity Auto-Tune chorus that splits the difference between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"" target=""_blank"">Chief Keef</a>’s stoned-to-Saturn mumblings and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30216-lil-durk/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Durk</a>’s fluttering menace. But it’s the tape’s final offering that is arguably the most interesting. “Hella Band$” is a pure bop song with a truly anthemic chorus sung by Leek. It's a crossover track only in the context of Chicago house parties, but as Louie struggles to find his footing in the wider hip-hop world it suggests that maybe his music doesn’t always need to be quite so askew.</p></div>"|18831.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18831-king-louie-drilluminati-2/|6.7|Jordan Sargent

Over the past 40-plus years, he's released about 30 albums. Some are solo, some are collaborative; some are studio and some are live; some are improvised and some are structured. He famously worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a> on the second of Eno's landmark <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11731-discreet-musicambient-1-music-for-airportsambient-2-the-plateaux-of-mirror-with-harold-buddambient-4-on-land/"" target=""_blank"">""Ambient"" series </a>(<i>Ambient 2: The Plateaux of Mirror</i>), and less famously made an album with the Scottish dream-pop band the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"" target=""_blank"">Cocteau Twins</a>, neither of which have any immediate common ground other than the fact that Harold Budd plays keyboard on them.</p>
<p>Despite the variety of Budd's collaborations and circumstances, his music has always had a quietly recognizable style: intimate and intuitive; fragile but warm; seductive but just a little bit mysterious, like the soft tinkling of a presence in the next room. (In a 2005 interview with the UK paper the <i>Independent</i>, he joked that his music tended to feel slow and searching because he usually recorded it drunk.)</p>
<p><i>Wind in Lonely Fences </i>is a 2xCD retrospective compiled by All Saints Records and released alongside three vinyl reissues of older Budd albums (<i>The Serpent (in Quicksilver)</i>, <i>Abandoned Cities</i>, and <i>Through the Hill</i>) and a seven-album box set called <i>Buddbox</i>. I'm writing about <i>Wind</i> here not only because it's the most convenient inroad to Budd's career, but because it's an ambitious project in its own right: with as many albums as Budd has to choose from and no responsibility to things like radio hits, the job of the compiler becomes an unusually creative one.</p>
<p>Starting with 1970's ""The Oak of the Golden Dreams"", <i>Wind</i> moves chronologically, ending with a track from his 2011 album <i>In the Mist</i>. Progression is obvious, especially early on. ""Dreams"", which was improvised on an old Buchla modular synth, has more in common with the dense ragas of Terry Riley than anything Budd composed in the 80s, and even 1978's ""Bismillahi 'Rrahman 'Rrahim""—from one of my favorite Budd albums, <i>The Pavilion of Dreams</i>—shows a willingness to indulge in vast, almost jazzy pieces of music that he'd give up within a few years. (A sap at heart, I wilt at the sound of an erotically played saxophone.)</p>
<p>Budd's music got smaller and more peaceful, but also more opaque, culminating in the work he's best known for: <i>The Plateaux of Mirror</i> and <i>the Pearl</i> (also with Eno and his protégé, Daniel Lanois). Soft, sparkling but always just beyond the edge of discernible pattern, Budd's pieces with Eno are like keyholes to dark rooms that Budd—in his reserve—never lets you into. It's this tension—between gentleness and threat, between intimacy and uncertainty, between the thrill of a hint and the human desire to see the whole picture—that makes them seductive on first listen but so easy to play on subsequent ones. Also worth noting is a track from Budd's 1981 album <i>The Serpent (in Quicksilver)</i>, which at 20 minutes long barely constitutes an album, but is my favorite Budd release right now—a series of miniatures less high-minded and delicate than his Eno collaborations, but earthier and more generous too, tapping into a history of jazz, Americana, and even country music that he rarely touched again.</p>
<p>The second half of <i>Wind</i> is spottier than the first—the textures less rich, the mood less sustained. ""Soft pedal,"" an airy, meandering piano technique of Budd's own division, is supplemented by even more reverb, which can be as much of a crutch as an aid. And while I've had my swings of passionate involvement with the Cocteau Twins, Budd's collaborations with both the full band and with guitarist Robin Guthrie have never really held my attention. (Guthrie's guitar sound—somehow both chilly but indistinct—has always sounded best to me when set against the sturdy backbeat of a drum machine. Against Budd he sometimes sounds like water cut with water.)</p>
<p>Even Budd's less interesting pieces have a toughness to them that I find surprising and unexpected. Having held myself off from making nature metaphors in a review about low-key instrumental music until now, I'll make one: the icicle: small but sharp, seemingly transparent but impossible to see through, delicate but chilly to the touch. <i>Wind</i> doesn't measure up to Budd's best albums and can't, but that's not what it was meant to do. It's a primer to a composer too often cited as a footnote and too modest to correct the record. </p></div>"|18889.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18889-harold-budd-wind-in-lonely-fences-1970-2011/|7.8|Mike Powell

It makes sense: the overarching theme binding all his output to date has been a resolute inability to remain fixed. Every component is in motion, subtly playing off one another as they glide around. Following a string of EPs, 2012's <i>The Isolated Rhythms of… </i>inaugurated the project with an under-the-radar gem, a cobblestone assortment of spatial, pulsating techno. Constantly metamorphosing, the album featured passages of unfurling splendor, thumping crusted loops, flashes of sleazy electro, neo-classical interludes and stretches of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1686-gas/"">Gas</a>-eous uplift, often all stitched into the same 16-minute track. That approach has been tempered somewhat on <i>The Ancient Tonalities Of…</i>, which swaps out some of the left-turns for a more moderate palate and sharply defined set of parameters.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This sophomore album<i> </i>rests primarily on patterns of tones, timbres and textures instead of usual songcraft, with an impressive attention to detail on levels both micro and macro. Ukkonen goes about attacking <i>Tonalities </i>with an unconventional approach on everything from the rhythmic core, crafting loops to guide the music but not affixing them to time signatures, as on ""Three Durations"" which alternates between beat cycles of 11, 13 and 15, to the utilization of effects, side-chaining drums then removing them entirely from the mix. If it all sounds technical, well, it is<i>, </i>but requires less of a locked-in mindset than at first glance. Largely the music works with some variation of soft-feel synths and drifting banks of bass, set against submerged thrums, coated in a pearly veneer. It is understated and cool, as if to consciously fulfill the ""arctic house"" tag placed upon Ukkonen along the way. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The tracks draw from the same frosty wellspring, but deviate enough to avoid homogeneity: peculiar tribal chants find their way through through the descending spectral light on ""My Euouae"", mirrored in part by the distant rattle of stretched drumskins and exotic chirrups on ""Nine Vjetar"", seemingly set on a deserted Aztec battlefield; ""Viva Las Huelgas"" unassumingly dips into a fluttering breakbeat with little forewarning, one of the few cuts to bare teeth; many tracks have an improvised jazz feel, discombobulated but organic, scattering sparse piano notes out like Easter prizes against formless fragments of percussion. But for someone who clearly spends a lot of time laboring over how every element speaks to one another, the flow of the record as a cohesive whole is lacking—a coterie of hermetically-sealed avant-garde experiments that court appreciation, but not necessarily attachment. </p>
<p class=""p1"">That said, Ukkonen retains a knack for delivering moments of disquieting beauty. The two strongest tracks, ""Iraupen Kuus"" and ""Eighteen Pitches"", both fall somewhere in the middle of Kompakt's crushed-ice prettiness, Border Community's pastoral glow, and the enveloping analogue warmth of Warp's ambient outposts. What Ukkonen now needs to master is learning when to let people in from the cold.</p></div>"|18819.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18819-ukkonen-the-ancient-tonalities-of/|6.9|Gabriel Szatan

Nothing is more personal than our own lives. Nothing is less personal than our own lives. The Internet's made it a whole lot easier to explore and expose inner demons and a whole lot harder to create in a vacuum.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In <i>Clapper Is Still, </i><a href=""http://waythrough.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Way Through</a>, the London-based duo of Christopher Tipton and Claire Titley, made a record with a completely transparent process that doesn't feel dashed off or incomplete. Each homespun song plots a course through England's history, from abandoned towns steeped in forgotten customs to the ghosts that haunt rolling green hills. On <a href=""http://waythroughwithyou.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their website</a>, the duo post a back story for each song. It's a hodgepodge of material, coming in the form of links, selfies taken in the places they're writing about, longer field recordings, mini write-ups that are loose but informative. It's all good information that glows with a real love for the subject matter, but it's not necessary to your enjoyment of the record, and often feels like an additional overwhelming layer to an already complicated album.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Take ""Imber &amp; Tyneham"". Because of the information on their site, I know that it's about two villages that suffered vastly different fates after World War II. Tyneham became a ""heritage destination amongst a still active army range"" and Imber ""remain[ed] strictly out of bounds training ground for urban combat."" The song vibrates with chaos and constant upheaval, Tipton's guitar restlessly moves from staccato pound to blurry, damaged strumming that eventually gives way to a field recording of bells knocking together. Even without knowing those facts, there's a sense of military urgency to the song. It sounds like a frantic march.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Way Through describe themselves as ""pastoral punk,"" and it's fitting. All of these songs are noisy but warm. ""Roughting Linn"" is upbeat and so thin you can virtually see all its moving parts, while ""Haxey"" is built on a pop-punk template, with a riff anthemic enough to be a Blink-182 castoff, except it's about something called ""the Haxey Hood,"" which is a really old drinking game that involves throwing a leather hood in the direction of a village's public house. The custom has been around for close to 700 years. Not exactly the ode to teenage love that Tipton's riff tricks you into thinking it is.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The best moments on <i>Clapper Is Still </i>come when the idea of the concept is apparent, even if the backstory isn't. ""Wharram Percy"" begins with a car door slamming, Tipton and Titley's trip through their country's collective history is coming to an end. It's a strong emotional moment, a heavy sigh after a series of songs that have completely muddled the historical with the personal. Tipton sings pure ghostly desolation, evoking the eerie beauty of abandoned villages: ""Powerlines flank, ditches and banks/An echo of a village, a melancholic margin/ You can relive everything."" That last part feels like Tipton is laying out what he and Titley have been trying to do over the course of <i>Clapper Is Still</i>. We have, collectively, spent the last few years pulling inspiration from what we already know, but listen closely, Way Through are showing us a new approach.</p></div>"|18880.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18880-way-through-clapper-is-still/|7.4|Sam Hockley-Smith

This might surprise people like me, who given a few beers and a tolerant audience will still lapse into vague, sentimental reminiscences about seeing Pavement in late 1999, a few weeks before Malkmus got onstage in Brixton with handcuffs around his mic stand, telling the audience—in a rare moment of disclosure—that the cuffs were a symbol. This, it turns out, is how a poet breaks up a band.</p>
<p>In retrospect, their breakup marked a moment when indie-rock's narrative started moving away from the sloppy, casual grace of the 90s toward bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"" target=""_blank"">the Strokes</a> and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4704-yeah-yeah-yeahs/"" target=""_blank"">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a>, who wore tighter jeans, had more conventional sex appeal, and played like there was something at stake. The irrelevance of Malkmus's solo career was a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>All things considered, he's taken it well, turning out albums at a regular clip, none of them exceptional but none bad either—and crucially, none that suggest that he's fixated on the past. They're fussier than Pavement albums, with intricate guitar parts and carnival-like shifts in rhythm that Pavement would have either found too showy or just too much of a chore to play. There's more focus on the fineries of production and arrangement, too. (You won't find trombones on Pavement albums.)  They're also goofier, which some listeners might find awesome, but I find a little annoying. Free from the intensities of being pretty much any age under 30, he now seems like what his critics always claimed he was as Pavement wore on into the late 90s: A smart dude horsing around.</p>
<p>I listen to these albums with a kind of passing happiness, surprised by how easily Malkmus can still make me smile, vaguely saddened by the idea that a smile is probably the most complex emotional response he'll get from me. <i>Wig Out at Jagbags</i> isn't all that different in spirit from 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15736-mirror-traffic/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mirror Traffic</i></a>, which is to say that it's less jammy and long-winded than either <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11233-real-emotional-trash/"" target=""_blank""><i>Real Emotional Trash</i></a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5058-pig-lib/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pig Lib</i></a> but essentially the product of the same mischievous brain. Most of it sounds sort of like 70s guitar-rock rendered as some kind of ergonomic desk toy: compact, brightly colored, unlikely to stir the depths of the soul but nifty nevertheless.</p>
<p>If Malkmus' post-Pavement career deserves more—or more serious—credit, it's for introducing a persona that hasn't really existed before: Male without the tediously burdened spirit of masculinity, arty but not pretentious, sensitive but too good-natured to make a fuss when his feelings got hurt. Even in Pavement days he was regarded as a kind of golden boy—the sweet liberal-arts alternative to Kurt Cobain, the stoner diarist beloved by jocks in part because he was everything they assumed stoner diarists weren't: funny, low-key, averse to competition but still knowledgeable about sports. ""We were raised on Tennyson and venison and the Grateful Dead,"" he sings on ""Lariat"". This is the Malkmus of both <i>Jagbags</i> and <i>Mirror Traffic</i>: Steeped in Victorian poetry but still knows his way around a grill.</p>
<p>And as with  <i>Mirror Traffic</i>, <i>Jagbags</i> is obliquely concerned with aging. ""I don't have the stomach for your brandy, I can hardly sip your tea,"" he sings on the slow-burning ""Independence Street"". ""I don't have the teeth left for your candy/ I'm just busy being free."" Later come the lines, ""Shanghai'd in Oregon/ Cinnamon and lesbians/ The power lines revolt in time / I've been tripping my face off since breakfast/ taking in this windswept afternoon."" Malkmus is 47 now, closer to getting his AARP card than to graduating college. Once the wistful 25 year old with a heart full of unspeakable sentiments, now he's the handsome middle-aged guy next door borrowing a pinch of weed to get him through this cookie-baking session for his son's end-of-the-season soccer party. He has never resisted age but has never seemed younger, and in the occasional la-la-la still shimmers with the charm of a boy.</p>
<p>At the heart of his music is still an inimitable bittersweetness—the light shrug that follows the realization that in time all things will die and pass. His best songs have always felt like ballads, regardless of tempo. There are some of those songs here: ""Lariat"", ""Houston Hades"", ""Independence Street."" But the sweetest and bitterest moment is near the end of ""Rumble at the Rainbo"", a two-minute rave-up that starts like a mock-punk throwaway and ends on the line, ""Can you remember the thrill and the rush? You're not out of touch. Come tonight you'll see: No one here has changed and no one ever will."" The performance is stupid and flamboyant, a duckwalk across a stage that only exists in his mind. Anyway, he was probably kidding. But as with most modest hearts, his best jokes have always been the ones he tells at his own expense. </p></div>"|18822.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18822-stephen-malkmus-and-the-jicks-wig-out-at-jagbags/|7.0|Mike Powell

After two years and change of simmering in obscurity, the sometimes-producer, mostly-curator's Long Island Electrical Systems imprint enjoyed a profile-raising 2012, emerging as one of the most thrilling American dance labels in a field that's typically dominated by European voices. The chatter surrounding L.I.E.S.' quiet climb served as a reminder that the New York City's still an embarrassment of riches when it comes to forward-thinking producers and DJs.</p>
<p>So when 2013 rolled around, Morelli did what any misanthrope enjoying a taste of low-level success would do: he left NYC, abandoning the city <a href=""http://www.junodownload.com/plus/2011/09/26/label-focus-long-island-electrical-systems/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he once referred to as an ""overrated cesspool,""</a> moving himself and the L.I.E.S. name to a new home in Paris. <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2013/11/28/im-just-disgusted-by-humanity-l-i-e-s-boss-ron-morelli-talks-spit-clubs-and-itunes/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">An interview with FACT</a> around the release of last year's dark, misshapen solo debut <i>Spit</i> (released by fellow <i>enfant terrible</i> Dominick Fernow's Hospital Productions) found Morelli in top grouchy form, the choicest quotes drenched with negativity: ""People are terrible and always have been. That's the harsh truth since the dawn of man...We're all going to die alone.""</p>
<p>Granted, Morelli's antisocial causticness shouldn't be surprising to anyone who's familiar with L.I.E.S.' loosely drawn aesthetic, which amounts to various strains of dance music filtered through layers of psychedelic grit and static sludge. The level of interest directed in the label's direction these days is partially owed to good timing, as noise musicians have increasingly turned their ears towards the dancefloor with results similar to L.I.E.S.' more inscrutable output.</p>
<p>More often than not, dance culture can't help but ascribe eye roll-worthy nomenclature to emerging sounds and scenes, which explains why you've probably heard L.I.E.S. releases referred to as ""outsider house,"" a term <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/13/outsider-house-dance-music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">not-totally-seriously coined</a> by distant-relative noisenik and Hessle Audio boss Ben UFO. (As curious labelings of American DIY-dance phenomena go, the term is certainly less embarrassing than <a href=""http://www.beatport.com/charts/emerging-genres-hipster-house/123219"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">what we were stuck with two years ago.</a>) The title of L.I.E.S.' second label-summating compilation, <i>Music for Shut-Ins</i>, may or may not playfully allude to its reputation for fringe-originating dance music. If so, it's another example of the label's overlooked sense of humor; the booklet art for 2012's <i>American Noise</i> comp took a yellowed image of a shish kebab, cast a phallic shadow on a mushroom, and <a href=""http://s.pixogs.com/image/R-4082267-1356219101-4411.jpeg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">drove the whole pointed stick straight through a gesticulating Skrillex's mouth</a>.</p>
<p>L.I.E.S. release music at a constant clip that, unless you're the type of listener that lives this shit for real, is nearly impossible to keep pace with; the swarm of sounds is so persistently overwhelming that it can (and occasionally has) come across as, well, just a lot of noise. So the label's compilations have functioned less as a way to keep tabs on its general direction, instead providing a somewhat incomplete but necessarily concise method of appraising what its artists have been up to as of late. It is, from a label run by a human being who has gone on record expressing a hatred of humanity, a considerably generous gesture.</p>
<p>Compared to the label's other long-playing excursions in 2013—a platter of rudimentary synth experiments courtesy of Brooklyn producer Marcos Cabral, the murmured nightmares of eerie-techno duo Shadowlust's <i>Trust in Pain</i>—<i>Music for Shut-Ins</i> approaches a perverted accessibility insofar that the L.I.E.S. catalog's lack of sonic approachability can occasionally come across as overstated. There are moments of flat-out gorgeousness—the skipping placidity of ""northeast"" producer Samanthas Vacation's eponymous side-long single, Berlin resident Florian Kupfer's distant, emotive soul-house jam ""Feelin'"", D.C. duo Beautiful Swimmers' jungle-infused ""The Zoo""—laid up against purely psychedelic workouts that carry their own iridescent beauty, like Beau Wanzer's trapped-in-the-mainframe ""Crush of Lust"" and L.I.E.S. regular Vereker's analog tunnel-chaser ""Rosite"".</p>
<p>Taken in small chunks, <i>Music for Shut-Ins</i> is as bewildering and exciting as its predecessor, a reminder of why L.I.E.S. have thus far escaped falling trap to faddish notions, remaining as engaging now as they did when no one was even talking about them. At two and a half hours, though, it's a slog as a front-to-back listen, particularly in the opening moments of the 2013-collecting first disc. This is fine, though, as the purpose of compilations like these aren't so much as to be listened to as proper albums as they are to literally compile, to properly round up singles that, especially considering L.I.E.S. low-profile method of releasing their white-label releases, would otherwise dissolve in the low-bitrate ether of YouTube rips.</p>
<p><i>American Noise</i> and <i>Music for Shut-Ins</i> share an identical structure: one disc of appraising the L.I.E.S. oeuvre thus far, and another disc of new material. Whereas <i>American Noise</i> had two years and change of material to draw from, <i>Music for Shut-Ins</i> takes its previously released work from just over a year's worth of releases, which drives home L.I.E.S.' increasingly impressive track record of releasing forward-thinking dance music. The second disc of <i>American Noise</i> suggested that the label's sonic future would further embrace fragmentation, and as such, anyone coming to <i>Music for Shut-Ins</i> looking for hints on where L.I.E.S. is or will be should look elsewhere. Above all else, Morelli and company have demanded that we expect nothing but the unexpected, and the pleasurably gnashing dissonance of <i>Music for Shut-Ins</i>' past/present collision suggests that the L.I.E.S. label's what's-next surprises are far from growing stale just yet.</p></div>"|18839.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18839-lies-presents-music-for-shut-ins/|7.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

The four-disc box set chronicles the output of Hazlewood’s California-based LHI label during the prime of the hippie era, and it’s steeped in the bright, balmy Hollywood atmosphere from whence it came. The first two discs comprise Hazlewood’s own solo output for LHI, namely the albums <i>Cowboy in Sweden</i>, <i>Forty</i>, <i>The Cowboy &amp; the Lady </i>(with Ann-Margaret), and <i>Requiem for an Almost Lady</i>; the last two discs collect songs by the label’s Hazlewood-picked roster of pop hopefuls, including obscure folk-rockers like Ray Chafin to Gram Parsons’ legendary country-rock pioneers, the International Submarine Band. Sunshine is everywhere: Alongside Hazlewood’s “Little Miss Sunshine” sit Suzi Jane Hokom’s “Come on Sunshine,” Arthur’s “Sunshine Soldier,” Joe Cannon’s “Warm Miami Sunshine,” and the Shacklefords’ “California Sunshine Girl.” Each of these tracks is indeed summery in its own way, as is most of <i>There’s a Dream</i>. But there’s one thing that neither this collection nor Hazlewood ever forgets: The brightest sun always casts the darkest shade.</p>
<p>Hazlewood launched LHI in 1966 after solidly establishing his music-industry bona fides—first as the writer/producer behind a string of twangy Duane Eddy hits, then as the mastermind who turned Nancy Sinatra into a name to rival her father’s with 1966’s “These Boots Were Made for Walkin’"". Flush with “Boots” cash, he established a Hollywood headquarters for LHI that sought to spin Hazlewood’s idiosyncratic, against-the-grain sensibility into gold. That never happened. By 1971, the label had all but disintegrated without producing a single major hit, at which point Hazlewood retreated into the cult-status hinterland for many years before enjoying a revival prior to his death in 2007. The rise and fall of LHI mirrors that of the 60s counterculture so precisely, it’s hard not to draw parallels. But the label, like its leader, never fully engaged the Age of Aquarius, opting instead to skirt its fringes. It wasn’t for a lack of ambition on Hazlewood’s part. He wanted to release bestselling records, plain and simple—his own included. But the freewheeling, spontaneous environment he fostered at LHI favored serendipity and cronyism over solid business sense.</p>
<p>On the plus side, that loose environment produced some enduring gems. LHI’s first signee was the Sunset-Strip-by-way-of-Amarillo outfit The Kitchen Cinq, and its upbeat, tambourine-rattling single from 1967, “Need All the Help I Can Get,” may as well have been a prophecy: The group would struggle along without much promotional backing from LHI, switching from the propulsive psychedelia of “Need” to the Association-esque sugariness of “I Want You"", a later single released after the band had been urged by Hazlewood to change its name to A Handful. That said, “I Want You” is a gorgeous piece of extravagantly harmonized pop—as is the output of another early LHI prospect, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31521-honey-ltd/"" target=""_blank"">Honey Ltd</a>. The girl group moved to L.A. from Detroit in hopes of securing a record deal, and the result was a string of releases—like the sumptuous single “Tomorrow Your Heart”—that highlighted the quartet’s silky, trippy romanticism, utterly distinct from the standard-issue Phil Spector lushness.</p>
<p>Hazlewood’s eye for the ladies was legendary. Even as he continued his run of success with Nancy Sinatra (as heard on their epochal 1967 duet “Some Velvet Morning”), the verging-on-40 Svengali courted a 20-year-old singer named Suzi Jane Hokom—both creatively and personally. Her output for LHI is some of the label’s best, as heard here on tracks like the aforementioned “Come on Sunshine"", a flutes-and-reverb-laced confection that recalls “These Boots Are Made for Walkin’” with its opening line, “I want to take these heavy boots off from my feet.” Hokom’s throaty, inviting voice plays even better against a hayseed foil—particularly one of LHI’s country crooners, Virgil Warner, with whom Hokom trades verses on “Lady Bird,” a cover of a haunting Hazlewood/Sinatra duet that Hokom and Warner actual improve upon. Hokom worked both sides of the studio at LHI, most famously producing the International Submarine Band’s lone full-length (and LHI’s most famous release), <i>Safe at Home</i>—but her relationship with Hazlewood soured after the Beatles tried to hire her away to work at Apple.</p>
<p>Interpersonal drama informs much of LHI’s backstory—the most notorious example being Hazlewood’s anger at Parsons’ defection from the International Submarine Band to join the Byrds, which spurred Hazlewood to pursue legal action that kept most of Parsons’ lead vocals off of the Byrds’ <i>Sweetheart of the Rodeo</i>. The International Submarine Band’s only appearance on <i>There’s a Dream</i> is the 1967 single “Luxury Liner"", later brought to light by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2045-emmylou-harris/"" target=""_blank"">Emmylou Harris</a>’ 1977 cover version (and album of the same name). The original remains a landmark in country-rock, rustic and rootsy yet indelibly in tune with the Beatles-and-Stones zeitgeist. If only the same could be said of LHI singles by Jon Christian, Danny Michaels, and Michael Gram—three singers that couldn’t sound more bland, prefab, and hopelessly square. But that pales before tracks like Hamilton Streetcar’s searing psychedelic-garage classic, “Invisible People"", a Seeds-like burst of minor-key dementia first revived by the Pebbles compilation series, and “Dusty Roads” by Eve, the trio that Honey Ltd. morphed into following the exit of a member. Soaring yet simmering, the harmony-soaked 1970 single sounds as rich as the Carpenters or ABBA.</p>
<p>Sadly, Eve’s contributions to <i>There’s a Dream</i> mark one of LHI’s few concessions to the mellowing tastes of the record-buying public as the post-hippie comedown of the 70s commenced. Even the label’s solo-songwriters were out of step with the tenor of the time, reflecting as they do Hazlewood’s misplaced (and often shifting) sense of loyalty; for instance, he signed Sanford Clark, a rockabilly singer with whom Hazlewood produced his first hit as a writer in 1958. Clark’s “The Black Widow Spider” is a charmingly eerie piece of Johnny Cash-inflected country, but it wasn’t going to save LHI’s fortunes. By the end of the 60s, Hazlewood seemed almost perversely resistant to playing the youth-culture game. One of the four Hazlewood albums LHI released, 1969’s <i>Forty</i>, is exactly what its title implies: a sad-sack account of the artist as an old man (or at least an almost-middle-aged one). On one hand, <i>Forty</i> is admirable in its unflinching candidness, although upon closer examination it’s as much of work of stentorian self-mythology as any Hazlewood disc. It’s a shame that some of his most fully realized work as a solo artist became lost in the LHI shuffle, especially seeing as how he was still cranking out hits with Sinatra—a phenomenon he tried in vain to replicate with 1969’s <i>The Cowboy and the Lady, </i>a spirited team-up with actress Ann-Margaret that veers dangerously close to novelty, thanks in part to Ann-Margaret’s overripe, thespian delivery. Still, it features Hazlewood near the peak of his craft, although 1970’s <i>Cowboy in Sweden</i> and 1971’s <i>Requiem for an Almost Lady</i> mark the high point of <i>There’s a Dream</i>. Like dusty velour drapes, the pair of discs open and close on a fading maverick whose whiskey-drenched, cowboy-poet persona begins to crack—and in doing so, reveals a vulnerability that’s equally maudlin and humanizing.</p>
<p>Just as the Kitchen Cinq’s “Need All the Help I Can Get” is unintentionally telling, so is “Dying Daffodil Incident,” a later track by the band’s last incarnation for LHI, A Handful. Mournful and vaguely, desperately reminiscent of the Mamas and the Papas, the song’s folksy shuffle barely distracts from a veritable catalogue of depressing imagery, up to and including a mention of “winter’s cocaine sunshine.” It’s not the kind of line likely to get a band played on the radio, and that decadent defeatism makes the song as evocative as it is oddly heroic. The same could be said of LHI as a whole. Of course, daffodils are mentioned by name in Hazlewood’s non-LHI hit “Some Velvet Morning"", a baroque, menacing masterpiece that marks the apex of his creative achievement. By 1971, those who had hitched their wagons to LHI were wondering where all the flowers had gone. Or as Hazlewood recites in his characteristic spoken-word intro to “Little Miss Sunshine”: “Sometimes it’s difficult to remember the good times/ But I know there were some.”</p></div>"|18825.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18825-theres-a-dream-ive-been-saving-lee-hazlewood-industries-19661971/|7.8|Jason Heller

This is a familiar paradox for lots of iconic imprints in their golden years, especially those whose worldview is more constitutional than searching: the more blueprinted and carefully curated an aesthetic, the more difficult it is to evolve. Over the last 20 years, Kompakt’s make a mark on dance music, honed its neatly-defined output down to pure science and put a tidy frame around it’s history. What next?</p>
<p>If not for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1201-dj-koze/"" target=""_blank"">DJ Koze</a>’s inspired 2013 breakthrough LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17793-dj-koze-amygdala/"" target=""_blank""><i>Amygdala</i></a> (which actually came out on his own label, Pampa), one could make the argument that it’s been years since any of Kompakt’s old guard have hit paydirt. Although perfectly pleasant, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2890-michael-mayer/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Mayer</a>’s late 2012 full-length <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17254-mantasy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Mantasy</i></a> failed to move the needle, while fellow tentpole <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4074-superpitcher/"" target=""_blank"">Superpitcher</a>’s been mostly MIA since 2010. Even the label’s once-lauded compilations like <i>Total</i> and <i>Pop Ambient</i> have suffered from serious quality-control issues of late. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2366-justus-kohncke/"" target=""_blank"">Justus Köhncke</a> doesn’t get the column inches of a Mayer or a Superpitcher, but he’s one of the Kompakt’s longest-serving and most representative artists. <i>Justus Köhncke &amp; The Wonderful Frequency Band</i> is his first full-length since 2008’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11209-safe-sound/"" target=""_blank""><i>Safe &amp; Sound</i></a>; as unfair as it is to the artist, it’s tempting to look to it as an indicator of the label’s current health.</p>
<p>Sadly, that narrative remains unresolved. Although <i>TWFB</i> boasts a characteristic mix of mid-tempo house, techno, disco and kitschy pop, it’s hardly a definitive statement. As with all of Köhncke’s work, it’s also infused with a whimsy that could be mistaken for indifference. That whimsy plays best when it’s applied to disco; in addition to boasting the greatest three-word distillation of Kompakt’s worldview yet, opener “Flitter Und Tand” (translation: “frippery and kitsch”) houses a slinky bassline and a charmingly goofy spoken word refrain that ranks among Köhncke’s most endearing and infectious moments. Likewise, lead single “Tell Me” is a particularly strong vintage of the aerodynamic disco-house hybrid for which Köhncke (and Kompakt) have come to be known. Tellingly, the album’s standout moment feels miles away from Köhncke’s comfort zone; the singer-songwriterly “Wonderful Frequency Band” boasts gently picked acoustic guitars and pianos, a swelling chorus, and absolutely nothing in the way of a 4/4.</p>
<p>But that sort of boundary pushing is in short supply here. Even at it’s best, <i>TWFB</i> is mostly just a well-crafted collection of genre exercises; a few too many tracks, like the motorik double whammy of “Das Selbstgespräch” and “Idee, Prozess, Ergebnis” and the ironically-titled “A New Direction”, are standard-issue deep cuts that offer little in the way of surprise. As evidenced by the goofy artwork and the album’s wide-eyed title, Köhncke’s interested in new ways of framing his work as a solo techno artist, but no metaphor, however offbeat, is deep enough to substitute for real surprise.</p></div>"|18722.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18722-justus-kohncke-justus-kohncke-the-wonderful-frequency-band/|6.5|Mark Pytlik

With the bewitching project Mamiffer, Washington state’s Coloccia has made majestic and often sinister slow music, ethereal stuff that treats audible danger with grace and mere prettiness with suspicion. For Coloccia, Mamiffer is only a key line on an impressive dossier of projects and co-conspirators. Elsewhere, she’s joined Finnish jesters Circle to compose an album around a church’s ancient organ, added instruments to Boris records, and launched the impressive multimedia imprint SIGE Records with husband and frequent collaborator, ISIS co-founder Aaron Turner. Though Barnett’s résumé hasn’t pushed his name beyond experimental circles, the Chicago multi-instrumentalist’s skill sets are rich. With the improvisational trio Oakeater, he’s navigated sidelong trips through acerbic drone and junkyard sounds. (Oakeater tellingly issued a split with kindred sculptors Yellow Swans in 2011.) Under his given name for the last several years, Barnett’s also released ponderous synthesizer-and-drum machine songs, <a href=""http://alex-barnett.blogspot.com/p/listen.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">music that sounded</a> like vaguely sinister scores for suspense films not yet made.</p>
<p><i>Retrieval</i>, the debut issue from the pair, stocks a wealth of variegated sound within its 39 minutes. Recorded and edited during two sessions in the Pacific Northwest, <i>Retrieval </i>sees Coloccia and Barnett revisiting multiple facets of their output: There’s Coloccia’s alien coo and Barnett’s mysterious electronics, his aggressive throb and her more placid expanses. Warped samples of AM radio transmissions comingle with soporific beats, and Motorik clicks ride beneath lurid keyboard nightmares. The music is of a fashion with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>’s most radiant moments and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3478-prurient/"" target=""_blank"">Prurient</a>’s least caustic. The minimalist melody of opener “Harbor” eventually pulls back like curtains to reveal a lupine wail and a background of sculpted static. “Hallway” patiently stacks and removes a dozen layers, from a low-note hum and granulated keyboard sighs to astringent squeals and a wraithlike rhythm. <i>Retrieval</i> succeeds by grafting the styles of two very distinct musicians, with their skills nested as a series of alternating concentric circles.        </p>
<p>But these seven pieces linger largely in a hazy middle distance, with their movements so subtle and sometimes miniature that they feel observed from across a great divide even when intently observed. That short beginner “Harbor” comes off like a prelude, with the series of rests intimating an ellipsis that leads to more pressing material. But “Switch”, which follows, hovers in much the same tentative realm. Near-harpsichord arpeggios and eerie electronics gradually introduce a metronomic beat, painted by neon tones that arrive and disappear with cardiopulmonary regularity. Even “Retrieval”, the album’s humming near-finale, depends upon the expectation of something more. Its sound moves in steady arches that again extend an introduction. Barnett and Coloccia seem forever to eschew the main event, never really turning any of <i>Retrieval</i>’s foreboding atmosphere into veritable drama. The eight-minute “Hallway” comes closest by instigating a soundclash against atonal noise bursts and comforting organ chords. By its end, though, even the album’s centerpiece feels as though it needs to be moored to some greater action. Delivered on repeat, restraint can start to feel like hesitation, a compositional crutch for avoiding controversy. <i>Retrieval</i> is a hypothetical soundtrack that feels lean without its filmic counterpart, a small record of instrumental ideas that stop just short of execution.</p>
<p><a href=""http://sigerecords.blogspot.com/2013/12/sige-2014.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Next year</a>, Coloccia’s SIGE will release a new LP by Oakeater and reissue <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Mamiffer-Oakeater-Split/release/2814031"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a 2010 cassette split</a> between that three-piece and Mamiffer. Hopefully, then, <i>Retrieval</i> is only the proper start of the working relationship between Barnett and Coloccia, in spite of their geographical distance and otherwise rather active recording schedules. On these seven tracks, each elicits many of the best aspects from the other’s musical palette. Even if the first draft feels minor and overly impressionistic, it suggests a beguiling synthesis of horror and harmony, unease and atmosphere. If together they can move beyond mere suggestion, Coloccia and Barnettt are capable of music that cowers with beauty.     </p></div>"|18794.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18794-barnett-coloccia-retrieval/|6.8|Grayson Haver Currin

<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">In retrospect, the adult gloss feels like an elaborate foil to the trouble she’d been cooking up in private all along. </span><i>Beyoncé</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, her fifth solo album, repositions the singer as the Houston-bred Yoncé, a woman lustier and surlier than B, more playful than Bey, fiercer than Sasha but softer and more natural than the lot. The album is brassy but elegant, its post-coital breath smelling faintly of cheap liquor sipped from a crystal flute. It finds Beyoncé shifting gears to pull off her most explicit and sonically experimental music to date, exploring sounds and ideas at the grittier margins of popular music.</span></p>
<p>It’s tempting to read <i>Beyoncé</i>’s hard edges as an attempt to ride the success of Rihanna or Miley Cyrus’ risqué agendas—but to do so would be to look past the album’s true provocations. <i>Beyoncé</i> pushes boundaries not because it sells sex at every turn, but because it treats a power-balanced marriage as a place where sexuality thrives. At a time when when young people are gripped by an ideological fear of monogamy’s advertised doldrums, <i>Beyoncé</i> boldly proposes the idea that a woman’s prime—personal, professional, and especially sexual—can occur within a stable romantic partnership. Monogamy has never sounded more seductive or less retrograde as when dictated on Beyoncé's terms. The innuendo can be bawdy and overblown—""Can you lick my Skittles/ That's the sweetest in the middle"" on ""Blow""—but sincerely so. And who would allow Jay Z’s instantly infamous breasts/breakfast line anywhere near the stargazing boom of “Drunk in Love” but someone truly infatuated with him? What’s more is that the erotic themes don’t feel out-of-step with the album’s more decorous moments, like the stadium-filling “XO” or “Blue”, its requisite treatise on motherhood. In <i>Beyoncé</i>’s world, there are illicit doors to be unlocked in the halls of tradition and vice versa.</p>
<p>The record reverberates with the energy of a conservative pop star navigating trends without grasping for them. Its crew of 44 writers, producers, and directors skews heavily toward the hip-hop realm and incorporates niche talents, something Beyoncé tried on <i>4</i> when she teamed with artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8010-switch/"">Switch</a> and pulled visual ideas from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44269-beyonce-accused-of-ripping-off-belgian-choreographer-for-countdown-video/"" target=""_blank"">little-known European choreographers</a> discovered via YouTube. It's the collective effort of an all-star team with a deep bench, with contributions from mainstays like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"">Pharrell</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"">The-Dream</a>, to fresh faces like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10351-chairlift/"">Chairlift</a>'s Caroline Polachek, a creative director from streetwear brand Supreme, and a practically-unknown producer named Boots.</p>
<p><i>Beyoncé</i>’s best songs often reject traditional pop structures in favor of atmosphere—she may have taken some cues from her sister <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26010-solange/"">Solange</a>, who now leads a particular wave of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52734-solange-announces-rb-compilation-featuring-cassie-kelela-sampha-jhene-aiko-more/"">collaborative, left-field R&amp;B</a>. The record, her darkest and lushest yet, has a tendency to echo, stop abruptly, or place two separate songs in the space of one. Its most bracing moments are also its toughest and weirdest, like ""***Flawless"", a two-part growler that makes feminist TED Talk fodder sound legitimately menacing. Timbaland and Justin Timberlake join The-Dream on ""Partition"" in service of the mean-mugging Yoncé, who snarls and bares her teeth as though the most revered rapper of all time is nobody but her little husband. At the center lies Beyoncé’s practically unfair abilities as a performer—you get the sense that Lady Gaga or Ciara could no sooner pull off the scale or quality of <i>Beyoncé</i> than you or I could pull off a suitable rendition of any of its songs in a karaoke bar.  </p>
<p>Beyoncé has loosened up her delivery, too, in a way that highlights her elasticity and shows her pop-cultural antennae tuned to the right channels. Who could’ve predicted that some of the most infectious snippets of pop music in 2013 would not arrive by way of anthemic chorus or assembly-line arrangement, but in Beyoncé’s ad-libbing? You already know the ones: <i>Surfbort</i>, she grunts on “Drunk in Love”, slinging a hashtag like it’s the name of a line of Ikea chairs, the single word serving as both shorthand for woman-on-top and a neat summation of an entire era of trends in rap cadence. You’d also be hard-pressed to find an internet-savvy person in America who hasn’t been possessed by the idea that he or she woke up like this, brain emblazoned with Beyoncé’s half-second <i>I’m so flawless I gave myself a seizure</i> dance. She's achieved the rare feat of validating meme culture by capturing its sneaky potency and delight rather than falling into its cheap, dehumanizing traps. This is a “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53337-beyonce-releases-self-titled-visual-album/"">visual album</a>,” sure, but it’s also a package of modern codes and discreet campaigns, a field of meaningful virtual dioramas. In this sense Beyoncé has a newfound spiritual ally in Drake (<i>Worst! YOLO!)</i>,—he shows up on <i>Beyoncé </i>on the bruised ""Mine""— her only peer to successfully streamline an internet-rooted mindset into a large-scale pop arena and seek profundity in the process.</p>
<p>Which is all to say that Beyoncé has delivered on the promise she inadvertently made by dropping an album and its expansive visual counterpart late on a Thursday night in December on iTunes, free of traditional fanfare. Call it a coup or just another victory for her mammoth PR apparatus, but consider the alternatives: The strategy probably would have failed if the quality wasn't there, and the album could not have achieved such an impact without its rogue—in spirit, at least—method of distribution. <i>Beyoncé</i> was unleashed upon the world in a way that could only succeed <i>right now</i>, with an aim to make the audience consume it the way it would have long ago. It’s a line that could be ripped straight from the mouth of an investment-drunk tech startup founder, but it’s true: Beyoncé seized the powers of a medium characterized by its short attention span to force the world to pay attention. Leave it to the posterchild of convention to brush convention aside and leave both sides feeling victorious.</p></div>"|18821.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18821-beyonce-beyonce/|8.8|Carrie Battan

Do you fight nagging suspicions that you've accomplished your goals and they failed to satisfy you? Do you cast about listlessly for motivation and inspiration in low moments? Have you ever guiltily killed an hour or three on Twitter? </p>
<p>Whoever you are, and whatever your low-grade malaise, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1434-e-40/"" target=""_blank"">E-40</a> is here to banish it. The Bay Area rap forefather is a human exclamation point, a superhero whose power is remaining helplessly in love with his work. E-40 works harder and more joyfully at making great rap music than you or I have ever worked on anything. Consider: In 2004, Jive Records released <i>Best of E-40: Yesterday, Today &amp; Tomorrow</i>, a compilation surveying a career so packed with highlights that you could quibble about its many omissions. Now, his devoted fans could be forgiven for wanting a ""best of"" culling from his last six full-lengths. And that would only go back to <i>last year</i>. </p>
<p>At any rate, here we stand, confronted with <i>Welcome to the Soil</i> <i>Pt. 4, 5, and 6</i>, which drop 45 new E-40 songs on the world. These arrive eighteen months after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16509-e-40-the-block-brochure-welcome-to-the-soil-vols-1-2-3/"">the first three volumes</a> and a year after his double album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17363-the-history-channel/"">History</a></i>, with Too $hort. Sometimes, contending with E-40's catalog can feel like cowering beneath the business end of a cement mixer. But unlike other prolific Internet-era data-dump rappers, E-40 releases albums without a single half-finished sketch on them, for full retail; his audience pays for this music, all of it, and screams the choruses of the new songs back at him at his shows. He is 46 years old.</p>
<p>To say, then, that these volumes lag <i>ever so slightly</i> behind the first three in color and excitement feels a bit like observing that the 86-year-old man who climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in his underwear wobbled just a bit before ascending the peak. Nevertheless, the tiny signs of thoughtlessness dotting the expanse of these <i>Soils </i>have to be duly noted: for the first time since he began this double- and triple-album blitzkrieg campaign, he repeats himself from installment to the next, recycling the excellent boast ""I'm crispy like Panko"" from <i>Pt. 5</i>'s ""Mister T.""  to <i>Pt. 6</i>'s ""Penetrate."" Several of the beats on <i>Pt. 4</i> sound like explicit attempts to recreate ""Function"", the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31412-iamsu/"" target=""_blank"">IAMSU!</a>-featuring breakout hit from from last year. </p>
<p>But that's about it: If you're plumbing for deeper quibbles with this project, stop here. 40's ability to elaborate on his decades-old subject matter hasn't slowed: On <i>Pt. 6</i>'s ""Project Building"", he shows us ""hundred round drums that look just like a curled-up snake,"" and on ""Rep Yo District"" he tells us the jewels on his neck ""look like baby tongues."" His details are so specific they nearly hurt your eyes: ""Granny bedridden"" are his two opening words on ""Do What I Gotta Do"", a song that also mentions needing to show up at your parole address. A character on ""Off The Block"" goes to jail ""on purpose just so he can get a decent meal."" In the middle of the hard-knock-life mob number ""Throwed Like This"", he throws in that his family uses ""a broom, not a vacuum, for the carpet."" Who else in rap currently scrutinizes the meaning of their environment <i>that</i> closely? </p>
<p>There are a lot of guests sitting across the huge banquet table, helping themselves to E-40's inexhaustible energy. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30134-schoolboy-q/"" target=""_blank"">Schoolboy Q</a> show up on ""All My Ni**az""; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a> (who offers the #peakRoss quote: ""My jacket's expensive/ It's made out of lizards"") and French Montana (who offers the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30094-french-montana/"" target=""_blank"">#peakMontana</a>: ""Can't you see I'm high? Stop talking in my ear"") on ""Champagne"". Houston legend Z-Ro drops in, sounding spectacular on ""In Dat Cup"". The spread of Bay Area artists half E-40's age or less is impressive, as always: Roach Gigz, J Stalin, Kool John, Young Bari, Decadez. They reinforce E-40's timelessness and his continued relevance; he might be one of the few rappers in the world with 12-year-old fans as fervent as his 40-year-old ones. </p>
<p>Accordingly, a sizeable chunk of the production comes from new artists who listened to E-40 when they were three years old. The North Hollywood-based rapper/producer Decadez offers a spare, rubbery take on mob music on ""Yellow Gold""; Flint, Michigan producer World Famous D-Boy locates some synth tones so low and menacing on ""Got That Line"" they threaten to set off nearby car alarms playing in your earbuds. Old and new styles coexist comfortably in 40's music in a way they don't elsewhere: The most audaciously ""off""-sounding beat on the project, <i>Pt. 6</i>'s ""In A Bucket"", comes from Rick Rock, one of the producers credited with pioneering hyphy.  Try to pick out a beat and guess which generation of Bay Area rap it comes from and you will be wrong half the time: In E-40's Bay, the classic stuff sounds avant-garde, and vice versa. </p>
<p>As he always has, E-40 tosses in a few ""state of the world today"" songs. They slow the momentum, but compensate through charm—on ""Home Again"", he frets about his niece and nephew's college loans, and on ""Don't Shoot The Messenger"" he reminisces about keeping ""a <i>Vallejo Times Herald</i> paper route to help pay the bills."" This specificity is the source of joy in E-40's music, the reason it never grows stale or formulaic. Making great rap music is a reason to live for E-40, and might very well sustain him through his sixties. Doing what you love, and doing it fiercely well, is a fountain of youth. </p></div>"|18843.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18843-e-40-the-block-brochure-welcome-to-the-soil-pt-4-5-6/|7.5|Jayson Greene

But rather than swim in a tank off the coast of Hawaii to the tune of $175 million, the waters Gerald Donald and the late James Stinson navigated as Drexciya were firmly kept within the impoverished confines of Detroit’s city limits.</p>
<p>Across a series of singles, EPs, and conceptual full-lengths released on labels like <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/label/258-Underground-Resistance"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Underground Resistance</a>, <a href=""http://warp.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp</a>, <a href=""http://www.rephlex.com/releases"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rephlex</a>, and Berlin techno imprint <a href=""http://tresorberlin.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tresor</a>, Drexciya conjured a world more evocative than Hollywood could fathom, and at a fraction of the budget. The fourth and final volume of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Journey+of+the+Deep+Sea+Dweller""><i>Journey of the Deep Sea Dweller</i></a> series (the Dutch imprint <a href=""https://clone.nl/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Clone</a>’s necessary reissue/rescue of Drexciya’s long out-of-print catalogue) proves that their releases are deep enough to warrant sequels with little dip in quality.</p>
<p>For those not familiar with the backstory, Stinson and Donald (operating under a cloak of anonymity) conceived of the mythic Drexciyans: a water-breathing humanoid race descended from the pregnant slave women cast overboard during trans-Atlantic deportation. Their mutant strain of electro, funk and techno—conjured on analog electronics and recorded directly to tape—is fittingly brutal. Even with forebearers like Kraftwerk and Cybotron, Drexciya’s sound remains singular.</p>
<p>Alongside a slew of unreleased tracks (at least six contain the word “Unknown” in them), some of their spikiest electro crops up here, from the severely phased, drillbit synths of “Aquatic Bata Particles” to the frantic, alarm-sounding “Mantaray”. While in hindsight Drexciya’s lineage to Detroit electronic music is evident, there’s also a latent sense of anger, fury and powerlessness to these tracks, one that at times makes me think of the duo as descendants of that “lost” Detroit act, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12673-for-the-whole-world-to-see/"">Death</a>. There’s as much of punk’s fury as techno’s pulse to be felt here.</p>
<p>If there’s been a downside to this otherwise excellent reissue series, it’s that Clone has scrubbed clean the dystopian Afrofuturistic backstory that attended each Drexciya release, those sub-aquatic realms of stingray battalions, Aquabahns, Lardossen cruisers, and Darthouven Fish Men are left to the imagination, as well as that institution only managed via sci-fi tropes. But in absorbing both the punishing stingray whips and distressed synths on the seven-minute “Hydro Cubes,” Drexciya seems to anticipate the sort of repugnant tones Kanye West reveled in just last year to create <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/""><i>Yeezus</i></a>’s “sorrowful and furious headspace."" But while Kanye proclaimed himself a god, Drexicya wondered if god was virtual reality. Nearly 20 years earlier, Drexciya were creating something equally livid and misunderstood.</p></div>"|18813.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18813-drexciya-journey-of-the-deep-sea-dweller-iv/|7.9|Andy Beta

Elements of industrial, drone, noise, and club culture all find equal weight in Kerridge's world, just as they do with similarly minded peers such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2/"">the Haxan Cloak</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30862-raime/"">Raime</a>, and the <a href=""http://blackesteverblack.bigcartel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blackest Ever Black</a> label. It helps that original artists from some of those disciplines have surfaced again, apparently rejuvenated. William Bennett from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4765-whitehouse/"">Whitehouse</a> is throwing out incisive techno in his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29847-cut-hands/"">Cut Hands</a> guise, while the dark wave electronics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"">Throbbing Gristle</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24666-chris-and-cosey/"">Chris &amp; Cosey</a> were manifested to satisfyingly bracing effect in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16431-transverse/""><i>Transverse</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17376-desertshore/"">X-TG</a> records. That's some tough company to keep for anyone punching the ""gloom"" setting on their sampler, although Kerridge's approach—building steadily through a series of EPs and signing to Peter Sutton and Karl O'Connor's longstanding <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Downwards-Records/255360997821158"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Downwards</a> label—hints that he's in this for the long term.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The atmosphere of Kerridge's debut full-length, <i>A Fallen Empire</i>, is immediately detectable without hearing a single note of the music inside. The cover features a man in his death throes, clutching his neck and about to fall. Song titles include ""Black Sun"", ""Straight to Hell"", and ""Death is Upon Us"". The shifts in tone throughout are slight, but significant. Some tracks deviate further into outright noise than others, with ""Black Sun"" floating away on overlapping waves of shrill sound at its close. Elsewhere, Kerridge amplifies the industrial influence; ""Straight to Hell"" is all metallic <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.A.F._(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">D.A.F.</a> drums pummelling away over grinding electronics. The mood is somewhere between sleazy and downcast, alternately embracing a misspent evening and its bitter aftermath. There are nihilistic thrills aplenty, but to dismiss <i>A Fallen Empire</i> as just that would be missing a layer or two of significance. Kerridge appears just as interested in meditative blackout, steering this album into small circles of introspection at key points.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s when <i>A Fallen Empire</i> steps off the brutalist treadmill that it gets most interesting. ""Scare Tactics"" taps into outright paranoia, drifting close to the surveillance society neuroses of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3306-photek/"">Photek</a>'s classic drum and bass cut ""The Hidden Camera"". It's a wise move by Kerridge to take on these different shades, making <i>A Fallen Empire</i> stand apart from his peers' current race into the shadows. The consequential downside is that some of the more somber material doesn't stretch far enough away from things happening elsewhere, with tracks such as ""Heavy Metal"" and ""Disgust"" edging a little too close to the area so expertly dominated by the Haxan Cloak on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17732-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2-excavation/""><i>Excavation</i></a>. Still, it's rare that a track passes without a suitably degraded loop holding the attention, or with a brain-battering beat set in motion with the intent to trounce all around it. The central figure that surfaces in ""Disgust"" suggests a primitive machine endlessly ticking away, its original purpose long since forgotten.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A recent <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast-episode.aspx?id=349"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with Kerridge pinpointed the moment where he discovered electronics, at the age of four when his parents immersed him in the U.K. acid house scene. On the surface it's an odd juxtaposition to the music he makes now, where the traditional feel-good vibes of clubland are trampled underfoot. But read a little deeper into that interview, or into the history of illegal raves, and stories of guns, violence, and strongarm police tactics are never far away. <i>A Fallen Empire</i> is brutal at times, lonely at others. It resembles a sober wake up call after years of the come-together sloganeering that forms a significant part of club culture. Perhaps it's a stretch to imagine this album as the inevitable consequence of a kid being immersed in a scene that ostensibly promoted peace and togetherness, only to find a gun waved in his face. But Kerridge's story isn’t so different from that of Margaret Chardiet, the New Yorker recording brutal noise as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31210-pharmakon/"">Pharmakon</a>, whose punk obsessive parents introduced her to the mosh pit at a young age. Like Chardiet, there’s a grain of experience here, a sense that this music is coming from an uncomfortably personal place.</p></div>"|18818.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18818-kerridge-a-fallen-empire/|6.7|Nick Neyland

Their music subsequently went in and out of print, becoming a valuable secret shared between friends, all caught up in Downes' fascination with labyrinthian song structures, literate pop, scratchy guitar sounds, and occasional string and horn flourishes. The music made by the Verlaines is neither difficult nor accessible, instead ending up in a fuzzy middle ground where both those impulses are indulged, giving their work a strange kind of weight all of its own.</p>
<p><a href=""http://capturedtracks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Captured Tracks</a> is issuing <i>Hallelujah</i> <i>All the Way Home</i>, the band’s first album from 1985, and the 1987 compilation <i>Juvenilia</i>, as part of its broader Flying Nun reissue campaign. It's a moment of vindication for Downes, who has toiled under the Verlaines name on and off for years, while also holding down a day job as a lecturer in music at the University of Otago in New Zealand. Still, it's most likely to end up as a treat for the devoted, a reward for years of allegiance. There's even a Verlaines <a href=""http://capturedtracks.com/catalog/_ct-release/fnct-009010-the-verlaines-hallelujah-all-the-way-home-juvenilia-bundle-w-limited-tote-bag/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tote bag</a> available for anyone buying both albums in one package—an item that fans of the Dunedin scene, after years spent trawling used record stores looking for Flying Nun artefacts, can't ever have dreamed of materializing.</p>
<p>""Death and the Maiden"" from <i>Juvenilia</i> is the natural starting point for the uninitiated, with its post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/522-buzzcocks/"">Buzzcocks</a> guitar sound, an odd stop-start section, a dreamy chorus, and a complete change of tact at the midway point. It even includes a helpful explanation of the band's name (taken from Paul Verlaine the poet, not <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4539-tom-verlaine/"">Tom Verlaine</a> the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4341-television/"">Television</a> frontman). Comparisons can be drawn between this work and similarly minded musicians who circled around the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcard_Records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Postcard</a> scene in Scotland around this time, even if Downes wasn’t necessarily aware of them. There are shades of the post-punk awkwardness and Beefheartian rhythms of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fire_Engines"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Fire Engines</a>, and a sense of influences stretching into soul in a manner akin to the material on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3226-orange-juice/"">Orange Juice</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6119-the-glasgow-school/""><i>The Glasgow School</i></a>.</p>
<p>What both these albums capture is the excitement of being in a band and discovering that you're onto something, even if the audience for it in the outside world isn't there yet. <i>Juvenilia</i> is well named— it could work as a title for either of these records—with Downes spitting out lyrics about drinking and love and alienation and hope. Over the extraordinarily lopsided rhythms of ""All Laid On"" he sings of dreaming despite it all, while on ""The Lady and the Lizard"" he needs to ""just be alone all day."" It's an unnervingly accurate embodiment of the conflicting emotions felt when you're still trying to make sense of the world. Or, as Downes puts it in his notes to <i>Juvenilia</i>, the sound of a band ""desperately trying to make some noise that made life more meaningful.""</p>
<p>A common thematic trope of both <i>Hallelujah</i> and <i>Juvenilia</i> is the way they both gallop through styles and strange deviations, being quite unafraid to take a turn into unexpected territory. <i>Hallelujah</i> dips into a folk lament (""Don't Send Me Away"") and follows it with the furiously incisive ""Lying in State"". <i>Juvenilia</i> positively drifts into the beautiful, drumless ""Wind Song"", while purposefully awkward tracks such as ""Angela"" (from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2318-chris-knox/"">Chris Knox</a>-recorded <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunedin_Double_EP"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Dunedin Double</i></a> EP) are executed with a breathless enthusiasm. The clumsy seal on these songs, whether deliberately designed or part of a learning curve, works so well as a mirror of the teenage fumbling the lyrics address, adding to the feel of someone stumbling through life, not sure where to turn next, simultaneously perplexed and in awe of everything around them.</p>
<p>The Verlaines' subsequent career was suitably diverse, hitting a high on the more inward looking 1987 album <i>Bird Dog</i>, enduring a rocky period in the 90s, and a reformation in the 2000s. Downes' 2001 solo album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2434-hammers-and-anvils/""><i>Hammers and Anvils</i></a> is the highlight of his later work. Fortunately his wit and skill for a quick turn of phrase never abandoned him—a 2003 compilation album of Verlaines material issued by Flying Nun was suitably named <i>You're Just Too Obscure for Me</i>. As that title suggests, Downes is of no doubt about his place in the world. ""It was music that was on the cultural fringes when we wrote it, and it still is,"" he said in a recent <a href=""http://pantograph-punch.com/dont-send-me-away-the-verlaines-reformed-and-reissued/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>. Still, his modest stories come with all-encompassing themes and the occasional grandiose notion, all beautifully hobbled by the Verlaines' wonderfully inexpert approach.</p></div>"|18838.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18838-the-verlaines-hallelujah-all-the-way-home-juvenilia/|7.6|Nick Neyland

Still, it's most likely to end up as a treat for the devoted, a reward for years of allegiance. There's even a Verlaines <a href=""http://capturedtracks.com/catalog/_ct-release/fnct-009010-the-verlaines-hallelujah-all-the-way-home-juvenilia-bundle-w-limited-tote-bag/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tote bag</a> available for anyone buying both albums in one package—an item that fans of the Dunedin scene, after years spent trawling used record stores looking for Flying Nun artefacts, can't ever have dreamed of materializing.</p>
<p>""Death and the Maiden"" from <i>Juvenilia</i> is the natural starting point for the uninitiated, with its post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/522-buzzcocks/"">Buzzcocks</a> guitar sound, an odd stop-start section, a dreamy chorus, and a complete change of tact at the midway point. It even includes a helpful explanation of the band's name (taken from Paul Verlaine the poet, not <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4539-tom-verlaine/"">Tom Verlaine</a> the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4341-television/"">Television</a> frontman). Comparisons can be drawn between this work and similarly minded musicians who circled around the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcard_Records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Postcard</a> scene in Scotland around this time, even if Downes wasn’t necessarily aware of them. There are shades of the post-punk awkwardness and Beefheartian rhythms of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fire_Engines"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Fire Engines</a>, and a sense of influences stretching into soul in a manner akin to the material on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3226-orange-juice/"">Orange Juice</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6119-the-glasgow-school/""><i>The Glasgow School</i></a>.</p>
<p>What both these albums capture is the excitement of being in a band and discovering that you're onto something, even if the audience for it in the outside world isn't there yet. <i>Juvenilia</i> is well named— it could work as a title for either of these records—with Downes spitting out lyrics about drinking and love and alienation and hope. Over the extraordinarily lopsided rhythms of ""All Laid On"" he sings of dreaming despite it all, while on ""The Lady and the Lizard"" he needs to ""just be alone all day."" It's an unnervingly accurate embodiment of the conflicting emotions felt when you're still trying to make sense of the world. Or, as Downes puts it in his notes to <i>Juvenilia</i>, the sound of a band ""desperately trying to make some noise that made life more meaningful.""</p>
<p>A common thematic trope of both <i>Hallelujah</i> and <i>Juvenilia</i> is the way they both gallop through styles and strange deviations, being quite unafraid to take a turn into unexpected territory. <i>Hallelujah</i> dips into a folk lament (""Don't Send Me Away"") and follows it with the furiously incisive ""Lying in State"". <i>Juvenilia</i> positively drifts into the beautiful, drumless ""Wind Song"", while purposefully awkward tracks such as ""Angela"" (from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2318-chris-knox/"">Chris Knox</a>-recorded <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunedin_Double_EP"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Dunedin Double</i></a> EP) are executed with a breathless enthusiasm. The clumsy seal on these songs, whether deliberately designed or part of a learning curve, works so well as a mirror of the teenage fumbling the lyrics address, adding to the feel of someone stumbling through life, not sure where to turn next, simultaneously perplexed and in awe of everything around them.</p>
<p>The Verlaines' subsequent career was suitably diverse, hitting a high on the more inward looking 1987 album <i>Bird Dog</i>, enduring a rocky period in the 90s, and a reformation in the 2000s. Downes' 2001 solo album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2434-hammers-and-anvils/""><i>Hammers and Anvils</i></a> is the highlight of his later work. Fortunately his wit and skill for a quick turn of phrase never abandoned him—a 2003 compilation album of Verlaines material issued by Flying Nun was suitably named <i>You're Just Too Obscure for Me</i>. As that title suggests, Downes is of no doubt about his place in the world. ""It was music that was on the cultural fringes when we wrote it, and it still is,"" he said in a recent <a href=""http://pantograph-punch.com/dont-send-me-away-the-verlaines-reformed-and-reissued/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>. Still, his modest stories come with all-encompassing themes and the occasional grandiose notion, all beautifully hobbled by the Verlaines' wonderfully inexpert approach.</p></div>"|18838.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18838-the-verlaines-hallelujah-all-the-way-home-juvenilia/|7.4|Nick Neyland

Since the London producer behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial </a>gained widespread attention with 2007's epochal second album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10877-untrue/"" target=""_blank""><i>Untrue</i></a>, listeners and critics alike have spoken of ""the Burial sound""—pitched-down vocal samples, rustling noise, blocky garage rhythms in perpetual decay—as if it were straight gospel. This is partially Bevan's fault: four years passed before any new solo material saw release, which allowed plenty of time for <i>Untrue</i>'s singular aura to seep into the collective consciousness. As imitators <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_8xfmxea2M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">big</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HbILc7X0BY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">small</a> have lined up to pay respect, the phrase ""sounds like Burial"" escaped the connotation of wishful thinking and started sounding almost like, well, an insult.</p>
<p>Insulting because, as this decade so far has proven, one person who <i>doesn't</i> sound like Burial anymore is Burial himself. 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15293-street-halo/"" target=""_blank""><i>Street Halo</i></a> EP, which followed a 12"" collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>, offered a few engaging structural tweaks to <i>Untrue</i>'s formula, but it was the collab EP with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"" target=""_blank"">Massive Attack</a> that followed later in the year, ""Four Walls"" b/w ""Paradise Circus"", that hinted Bevan was ready to explore truly new territory. Essentially a pair of Burial edits of songs from Massive Attack's 2010 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13864-heligoland/"" target=""_blank""><i>Heligoland</i></a>, each cut pushed past the 11-minute mark and embraced a proggy, amorphous structure that was worlds away from the contained environments of previous Burial releases. If the Massive Attack edits suggested a shift away from the past, 2012's astounding pair of EPs, <i>Kindred</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17498-truant-rough-sleeper/"" target=""_blank""><i>Truant/Rough Sleeper</i></a>, broke free of any previously set constraints, as Bevan wielded his newfound appreciation for side-long track lengths and added splashes of sonic color—arpeggiated synths, chunky house motifs, rickety windchimes, bursts of beatific melody—to his established palette of blues and grays.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, the only consistent aspect of Burial's music is the frequency of when it's been released—typically and almost <i>too</i> fittingly, in the dead of winter—so the excitement that arrives with the announcement a new Burial release in 2013 is no longer ""It exists!,"" but ""What is this going to <i>sound</i> like?"" <i>Rival Dealer</i> arrives almost exactly a year after <i>Truant/Rough Sleeper</i>, but the stylistic leaps made on this new release are more jarring and revelatory than anything in Burial's catalog. It's unquestionably his strongest release since <i>Kindred</i>, and his most satisfying statement of purpose since <i>Untrue</i>.</p>
<p>The seismic stylistic shift that Bevan's made on these three tracks—two of which, true to recent form, run well over the 10-minute mark—is immediately apparent on the opening minutes of <i>Rival Dealer</i>'s title track, when a distorted vocal sample of adult-contemporary cheeseball Gavin DeGraw's ""More Than Anyone"" (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s4iSwWqRIc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">yes, really</a>) gives way to a furious drum break, making for Burial's most straightforwardly uptempo move to date. The rhythm simultaneously sounds crisp and hissing, eventually disintegrating in a blare of police-scanner noise before everything goes truly pear-shaped with a monstrous, buzzing bassline, as a woodblock rhythm from the <i>Untrue</i> days clicks and clacks below the chaos. In the few interviews that Bevan has given throughout his career, he's outlined Burial's conceptual aims as a tribute to the rave music he didn't get a chance to grow up with but experienced second-hand; the unbridled intensity of ""Rival Dealer"" is arguably his most explicitly rave-y move yet.</p>
<p>""Rival Dealer""'s final, impressionistic third is the one section on <i>Rival Dealer</i> that dips into familiar Burial territory, with meditative synths and stray vocal samples briefly interrupted by a radiant saxophone line. It's a necessary comedown after all the preceding intensity, as well as a teaser for what follows: ""Hiders"" and ""Come Down to Us"", the EP's following two cuts, are the source of <i>Rival Dealer</i>'s most mind-blowing moments, as well as being the closest that Bevan's come to total accessibility since <i>Untrue</i>'s earwormy lead single ""Archangel"". The EP's other side-long epic, ""Come Down to Us"", takes cues from the crawling sense of pacing established on the Massive Attack edits, with a rhythm so slow it barely registers on the BPM scale stretched across 13 minutes, as a slinky sitar-like figure and piping synths give way to a sparkly, unnervingly sentimental soft-rock melody, the sounds of drizzling rain coating the whole thing.</p>
<p>If ""Come Down to Us"" is Bevan laying out conventional melodic forms across his template of psychedelic sprawl, ""Hiders"" is 2010s-Burial in miniature form, his only sub-five-minute solo cut of the decade thus far and one of the only true standalone tracks in his catalog (not an insult—he's a deep-listening artist at this point). It opens with an anthemic synth figure that starts and stops several times, returning each time with varying fidelity, before a splashy arena-rock drumbeat crashes through the ambience, stepping in time with the cascading synth figure and a vocal sample that seems to hover just slightly above everything else. The beatific, neon ""Hiders"" is Bevan's take on the more loved-up element of rave music—if ""Rival Dealer"" is a tip to the days of Kool FM, then this is more along the lines of the stuff spun by DJs like Scott Hardkiss and Danny Rampling—but even those without a lick of dance history know-how will be wowed by ""Hiders""' magnificent aura, a down-to-the-buzzer entry as one of 2013's most surprising musical moments.</p>
<p><i>Rival Dealer</i> has some of the most immediate music from the Burial project, but it's worth noting that this is also a noisy, dissonant work. Tape hiss and static smother large sections of the EP, and Bevan seriously tips the scales when it comes to one of the staples of Burial's style, as well as rave music at large—the vocal sample. He liberally applies voices all over the three tracks, both as a structural anchor and to create a pleasing cacophony; during ""Rival Dealer""'s coruscating midsection, he throws in a sample of New York rapper Lord Finesse's ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzYQWKHMdA8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You Know What I'm About</a>"" in a showoff-y, very un-Burial fashion. Burial has often been praised for restraint; the wild-eyed, play-anything nature of <i>Rival Dealer</i> shatters that notion for the better.</p>
<p>Speaking of vocal samples: a theme that runs through <i>Rival Dealer</i>, upheld by the many voices that dot its landscape, is self-acceptance. Phrases concerning sexuality and personal reflection abound—""This is the moment when you see who you are,"" ""It's about sexuality, it's about showing a person who you are—to me, this is who I'm about,"" ""This is who I am,"" ""Who are you?"". ""Come Down to Us"", in particular, ends with an extended lift of a passage from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crHHycz7T_c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">transgender filmmaker Lana Wachowski's painfully moving speech while receiving the Human Rights Campaign Visibility Award</a> last year.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2013/12/11/burials-rival-dealer-is-a-christmas-story-about-love-confusion-and-sexuality-and-is-the-best-thing-hes-made-since-untrue/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Some</a> have already speculated that Bevan's framing here is intentional, possibly speaking to his own personal experiences. Whatever the case, ""Come Down to Us"" is <i>Rival Dealer</i>'s nucleus, as its titular vocal sample appears throughout the EP. The fact that such guesswork takes place to begin with is evidence of how, after nearly a decade of making music, William Bevan continues to fascinate and create intrigue. Here, he provides plenty of exciting material to pore over until he returns, further changing our perspective on an artist we're still just starting to understand.</p></div>"|18820.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18820-burial-rival-dealer-ep/|9.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

Though the group—saxophonist Mats Gustafsson, drummer Paal Nilssen-Love, and bassist Ingebrit Håker Flaten—initially came together in 1999 as a tribute project dedicated to trumpeter/out-music legend Don Cherry, they quickly evolved and found its own identity, performing improvised music that’s informed by the urgency and simplicity of garage rock. If you line up a list of the Thing’s cover selections—songs by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/853-the-cramps/"" target=""_blank"">the Cramps</a>, the Sonics, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"" target=""_blank"">PJ Harvey</a>—against their roster of collaborators—weirdo-luminaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/"" target=""_blank"">Jim O’Rourke</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/482-peter-brotzmann/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Brötzmann</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2744-merzbow/"" target=""_blank"">Merzbow</a>—you can get an idea of where their sensibilities lay.</p>
<p><i>Boot!</i> is the Thing’s sixth full-length album and it’s among the group’s finest efforts at pairing bludgeoning physicality with heady free jazz chops. The record opens with a high-volume re-think of “India”, from John Coltrane’s 1963 album <i>Impressions</i>. Here spiritual jazz is recast as raw and sludgy stoner rock, with Flaten and Gustafsson dropping the lead melody down a few octaves and delivering the notes in loose, creaky unisons before dropping into a savage free-for-all. So long as you are acquainted with and sympathetic to the work of Geezer Butler, the song will retain some of Coltrane's meditative spirit.</p>
<p>The original compositions on <i>Boot!</i> work the band’s extensive vocabulary of skree and pummel. The Thing’s reputation is based on loud and heavy blowouts, but they also make expert use of dynamics. Over the course of 10 minutes, “Reboot” shifts from rigid pounding to quiet saxophone squawks, to a pummeling groove that recalls the heavier work of experimental-minded Dutch punk band, the Ex. On the title track, Flaten and Gustafsson play a series of long and hoarse honks, establishing a grinding, doomy tempo while Nilssen-Love gradually builds steam in the background.</p>
<p>The Thing frequently appropriate contemporary rock tunes into their repertoire, but their approach is markedly different than that of, say, pianist Brad Mehldau re-working Radiohead’s “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_4fiMIxO2E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Exit Music (For a Film)</a>” or the Bad Plus covering Nirvana’s “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKllfSfgB4k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Smell’s Like Teen Spirit</a>”. In those re-thinks, jazz players expand and complicate the harmonies of the songs' melodic hooks. The Thing are more likely to look to the rhythmic thwacking of a power chord for inspiration. On <i>Boot!</i>, they steer clear of rock and roll covers, but the fuzz, grit, and energy of the music are still very much a part of their sound. Heavy riffs are treated as scaffolding for excursions into free improvisation—a mechanism through which Gustafsson, Nilssen-Love, and Flaten can access a heightened level of bombast, a place where the guitar is always on fire.</p></div>"|18735.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18735-the-thing-boot/|7.7|Aaron Leitko

Aaron Edge, the group’s leader, is familiar enough with short-lived bands. During the last two decades, he’s jumped between at least a half-dozen acts, from the distended anthems of the trio Brothers of the Sonic Cloth to the pugnacious sludge of Rote Hexe. He played in the earliest versions of metalcore militants Himsa and, of late, he’s drummed in his wife’s spry punk duo Blood Buddies. Lumbar is Edge’s collaboration with two frontmen—Yob’s Mike Scheidt and Tad Doyle, frontman for the grunge-plus band that took his first name and Edge’s bandmate in the aforementioned Brothers. Edge wrote and recorded the music and penned the lyrics; during one long weekend in Seattle, they added their voices. And with that, the project is probably finished.</p>
<p>But this isn’t a one-off necessarily by choice: Not long after Scheidt and Doyle agreed to join the project, Edge spent 40 anguished days in bed, getting up only to use the bathroom or to stretch his legs. In 2011, the marathon runner, distant cyclist and graphic designer began experiencing pain in his hands, which he attributed to his exercise style. He made some adjustments to his regimen and equipment and carried on, although the pain slowly metastasized. Finally, in early January of this year, the discomfort overwhelmed him. “My hands and feet feel as if they are asleep and crushed under heavy weight every minute of every day/night,” <a href=""http://furtherfasterforever.com/blog/aaron-edge/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he has said</a>. “I could no longer shift my gears on the bike, could not hold drum sticks while playing in my wife’s band, could not do dishes or other chores around the house.” Two months later, a neurologist diagnosed Edge with multiple sclerosis. He worked through bouts of depression, thoughts of suicide, and days of agony. In May, he was well enough to enter the studio with Scheidt and Doyle. The pair sang lyrics he’d mustered while he’d been stranded in bed, words that cursed his symptoms and demanded an escape. In honor of the three spinal taps Edge endured for a diagnosis, <a href=""http://www.nocleansinging.com/2013/09/16/an-ncs-interview-aaron-edge-lumbar/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">they took the name Lumbar</a>. Edge says he’s currently not writing new music and that this may very well be Lumbar’s first and final album.</p>
<p>While Lumbar’s creation myth is compelling, the music does not slink at all in its shadow. With seven tracks and a runtime of less than 25 minutes, <i>The First and Last Days of Unwelcome </i>is a confident and decided trek through doom metal. Many of Edge’s projects have ventured into this territory before, but this combination works better than the bulk of his past. Scheidt and Doyle—a singer and a screamer, respectively—animate these songs wonderfully, adding gusto to Edge’s grievances. Scheidt and Doyle earn the most obvious name recognition here and give this harrowing tale voice. But Edge’s role in building these songs himself drives the bulk of <i>Unwelcome</i>’s success. Despite the record’s brevity, these numbers manage to both honor and upend their clear slow-metal precedents. On the side of reverence, “Day Six” works from the same looming vantage as Sleep; the electric lead hangs in a haze of distortion, with the theme doubled by bass and beaten by a ringing snare drum and splashing cymbal. Scheidt wrestles the worry from Edge’s lyrics of damaged viscera and dashed expectations, his ascendant and piercing tone adding a theatric bravado to the suffering. His power suggests Messiah Marcolin time at Candlemass’ helm. Likewise, the bass and guitar mirror one another during “Day One”, rendering the riff as a tumescent march sizable enough for Electric Wizard. The song opens with a<a href=""http://www.tvquotedb.com/shows/the-twilight-zone-1959/quote_13052.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> tough-guy quote</a> from <i>The Twilight Zone</i>, fulfilling at least one other genre requisite.</p>
<p>Perhaps more interesting, though, is the stuff that inverts or otherwise works against methodical and monolithic doom. Especially in the record’s middle, Lumbar offers surprising reappraisals of mood and form. “Day Three” cuts and loops what could be a sliver of a solo from a hair-metal hit and pits cascading chords against it. Doyle screams in the background, doing his best to fight through the furor. This text-painting ingenuously underlines Edge’s predicament—that is, how best to fight through the noise that’s masking what used to be your vivacity. “Day Four” opens in a down-tuned tantrum. A minute into it, the guitars yield and extend the sort of arid lines that might populate an Ennio Morricone score. They hang over a hi-hat beat that starts to feel like techno, all up-and-down motion and hard divisions. And with foreboding noise and gasped vocals filling whatever crevice they can find, “Day Five” pushes toward the claustrophobic atmospherics of Sutekh Hexen or the less guitar-focused experiments of Sunn O))). These tracks are no less foreboding than their more customary counterparts, no less connected to the suffering of Edge’s perspective. They simply reveal different angles of it.</p>
<p>Southern Lord released <i>The First and Last Days of Unwelcome</i>, making it one of the most widely available releases of Edge’s long career. He’s worked there for several years as the art director, after all, designing layouts and logos for the label’s releases. But this shouldn’t be mistaken as nepotism or as a charity case of any sorts. With or without Edge’s troubles, the music on <i>Unwelcome</i> would be plenty compelling. But his story became the prime motivation for Lumbar, the engine for three old friends coming together to finish an extraordinary entrance that unfortunately serves as an exit. </p></div>"|18705.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18705-lumbar-the-first-and-last-days-of-unwelcome/|7.7|Grayson Currin

This six-track debut album from the Brooklyn-based producer may look more like an extended EP on the surface, but the one-hour-17-minute runtime puts it far in excess of most standard LPs. Hackford is naturally drawn to the trancey side of house music, where repeating motifs circle across vast dimensions of time. He's also interested in rock dynamics, sometimes veering toward krautrock and the blissful velocity of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"">Spacemen 3</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">'s landmark </span><i>Playing with Fire</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">.

Dusting the overall sound with a grainy texture is a wise move, creating a sense of unity in an album that fractures in many directions.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Something Hackford doesn't lack is ambition, even if it is executed in a manner that makes his music feel purposefully small. On ""Slow Emotion"" he channels the kind of wide open spaces <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3241-panda-bear/"">Panda Bear</a> likes to cover, although the general tone is closely aligned to the fuzzy haze-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1524-flying-saucer-attack/"">Flying Saucer Attack</a>. Still, <i>Fair</i> has the same air of exploration as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10025-person-pitch/""><i>Person Pitch</i></a>, matching the way it can grind the life out of three-second loops without losing any intensity. Hackford isn’t as stylistically cohesive as Noah Lennox, instead dropping low-rent club bangers with a debt to the initial IDM boom (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16237-bryce-hackford-another-fantasy/"">""Another Fantasy""</a>) then taking a wayward turn into the twilight feel of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27668-nite-jewel/"">Nite Jewel</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12888-good-evening/""><i>Good Evening</i></a> (""Heart to Beat""). It makes sense that Hackford has played with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28087-arp/"">Arp</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24170-delia-gonzalez-and-gavin-russom/"">Delia Gonzalez</a>, who have both taken a similarly zoned-out approach to electronics.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The structurally sound work in the first half of <i>Fair</i> is let go in its back end, with Hackford ending the album via two songs in excess of 20 minutes per piece. It's here that Hackford loosens his brain, with the 22-minute ""Run-On Cirrus"" approaching the masterful build his former charge Gonzalez worked out with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29853-gavin-russom/"">Gavin Russom</a> on the minor <a href=""http://dfarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DFA</a> classic ""El Monte"". The difference here is that ""Run-On Cirrus"" digs deeper into an ambient tradition, drifting into sheets of synth that resemble <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5612-vangelis/"">Vangelis</a> channeling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3169-the-orb/"">the Orb</a>'s <i>U.F.Orb</i>. He takes a step further into the calm on the following 27-minute piece ""Modern Propeller Music"", almost losing all sense of self entirely in its echoing guitar figures. Here, Hackford demonstrates a knack for knowing when not to play, removing the compression from his work but retaining the mesmeric force from his more compact structures.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Fair</i> latches onto sounds that are emerging elsewhere at present, including traces of the ultra-compact work of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5189-the-black-dog/"">the Black Dog</a>'s <i>Bytes</i> on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28822-laurel-halo/"">Laurel Halo</a>'s excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18678-laurel-halo-chance-of-rain/""><i>Chance of Rain</i></a>, the lingering influence of vintage sci-fi soundtracks, and the loosening of borders between noise and techno. Hackford's inevitably going to be aligned with the mini boom in scruffy house, but there's enough scope here to suggest he can survive when the walls come tumbling down, especially as he's been at this since 2007 and has branched out to work on projects such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/730-rhys-chatham/"">Rhys Chatham</a>'s <a href=""http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/a-crimson-grail"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>A Crimson Grail</i></a>. That recording, as part of 200-strong guitar orchestra assembled by Chatham, taps into the same kind of audacity Hackford gets caught up in as he goes deeper into <i>Fair</i>. There are strict limitations and open-ended thinking here, on a work that's more interested in the constant process of evolution than finding a place to comfortably land.</p></div>"|18789.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18789-bryce-hackford-fair/|7.0|Nick Neyland

One was Tina Turner, on her way to 80s multi-platinum success with “Private Dancer”, which the company was willing to forgive. But the other act, Saâda Bonaire, which featured two model-esque non-singers Stefanie Lange and Claudia Hossfeld, had their lone single released, only to be immediately dropped from the label, never to be heard from again.</p>
<p>As this unexpected reissue from Captured Tracks (released under their new Fantasy Memory subsidiary) reveals though, <a href=""http://capturedtracks.com/news/coming-soon-saada-bonaire-2xlp-cd/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Saâda Bonaire</a> was the concoction of Ralph “Von” Richtoven, a Bremen club DJ who fancied himself a Svengali, never mind that his vision for the group included upwards of 20 musicians at any one time who didn’t speak the same language—much less played the same musical scale—backing up his non-musical fiancée, Stefanie Lange and her friend, both women clad in Bedouin wear. For a group that had one single, this reissue unearths an entire album’s worth of material, produced by dubmaster Dennis Bovell in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"" target=""_blank"">Kraftwerk</a>’s Cologne studios. As the aforementioned names might attest, it makes for a curious early 80s mutant sound.</p>
<p>When Richtoven first conceived of the group, he had a local German reggae band he managed enter a studio to cover both J.J. Cale’s “Ride Me High” and James Brown’s “It’s a Man World” (unfortunately these covers were left off this reissue). He then set about overdubbing some Kurdish folk musicians he met via a Turkish Communist community center, adding his fiancée and her friend last. Trainwreck though it might scan, the results were intriguing to say the least, convincing EMI to let them record some more.</p>
<p>Enter that none-hit wonder, “You Could Be More As You Are”, which remains a curious beast: rubbery reggae bass, growling gong hits, synth stabs and jerky rhythms from hand drum and drum machine, featuring an assortment of whistles, saxophones, Turkish saz, and ney flute, all of it topped by the icy monotones of Lange and Hossfeld, who recall their memories of a German friend who sold her body for money at a young age, hit every club every night, and died too soon. It was idiosyncratic in their native Germany in the age of Neu Deautsche Welle groups, yet somehow became a club hit in Greece, and soon after became a holy grail for Balearic DJs around the world, where it fetches upwards of $170 a copy online.</p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that the album never saw the light of day back in the early 80s, as Saâda Bonaire had plenty of kindred spirits from that era. Over the percolating congas, pliant basslines, upstroked guitar, and saz licks of “More Women”, they sound a bit like Tom Tom Club. The snappy and spare “Heart Over Head” finds a middle ground between the Flying Lizards’ cover of “Money” and Soft Cell’s take on “Tainted Love”. The synth bass on “Invitation” emulates Imagination’s dancefloor smash “Just An Illusion”, though it’s shot through with ney flute and a vocal delivered as if Lange and Hossfeld were instead auditioning for <a href=""http://youtu.be/Rm11CJIZTsM?t=20s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that notorious Calvin Klein Obsession commercial</a>.</p>
<p>The presence of Bovell, the Barbados-born, yet London-based dub producer who produced Linton Kwesi Johnson’s iconic 70s reggae albums as well as post-punk classics like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4113-the-slits/"" target=""_blank"">the Slits</a>’ <i>Cut</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9376-the-pop-group/"" target=""_blank"">the Pop Group</a>’s <i>Y</i>, helps tie together what should have been a total mess. It’s easy to hear post-punk’s DNA here and from the vantage point of 30 years, one can imagine how Saâda Bonaire might have been an influence on the icy minimal wave sound, the talk-sing grooves of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29484-peaking-lights/"" target=""_blank"">Peaking Lights</a>, not to mention the vocals of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1728-glass-candy/"" target=""_blank"">Glass Candy</a>’s Ida No. In another dimension, maybe Saâda Bonaire’s multi-culti dancepunk tracks would have influenced someone like M.I.A., or else their gender-bending lyrics could have been behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17847-the-knife-shaking-the-habitual/"" target=""_blank""><i>Shaking the Habitual</i></a>. Alas, this rescued album can only show that Saâda Bonaire could have been more than they were.</p></div>"|18804.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18804-saada-bonaire-saada-bonaire/|7.4|Andy Beta

He caught the small screen bug after a stint as a writer for “30 Rock” and skated off to join the ensemble cast of NBC’s “Community” in 2009. With “Community” approaching what might be its twilight, Glover jumped ship this year to become the star and showrunner of his own loosely autobiographical FX sitcom “Atlanta.” He hasn’t had much time for stand-up since 2011’s hour-long special <i>Weirdo</i>. In a sense, his rap career, hatched in 2008 after plugging his name into an online Wu-Tang rap name generator and receiving “Childish Gambino” as a result, has been his most enduring project. It has also been his most troubled.</p>
<p>Early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30074-childish-gambino/"" target=""_blank"">Childish Gambino</a> releases like 2008’s <i>Sick Boi</i> carried the playful “Just fucking around, sorry!” vibe of a rap career started on a lark but buckled under too much squeaky voiced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a> worship. Gambino later linked up with “Community” composer Ludwig Göransson for <i>Culdesac</i> and <i>EP</i>, proudly twee-as-fuck offerings that pondered Glover’s outsider upbringing over increasingly plush instrumental settings. But as the beloved “Community” awarded Glover’s musical exploits a higher profile, the pridefully uncool sloganeering of songs like <i>Culdesac</i>’s “Different” crystallized into spite. Gambino seemed to draft <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16074-camp/"" target=""_blank""><i>Camp</i></a>, his nerd rage nadir of a debut studio album, as a piss and vinegar shower for his doubters. It spent more time thumbing its nose at the backpackers, racists, and dismissive women that gouged out the massive chip on Glover’s shoulder than it did, you know, trying to be a good rap album. The 2012 follow-up mixtape <i>Royalty</i> tried to recover by calling in buddies from Black Hippy, Wu-Tang Clan, and more to boost Gambino’s hip-hop cred, but he ended up getting creamed every step of the way by his more talented friends.</p>
<p>This year Donald Glover got weird. He announced a new album, the clunkily titled <i>Because the Internet</i>, and launched into a promotional campaign that included a confessional series of Instagram posts about depression and fear, frank talk about mortality in interviews, an introductory prelude-cum-making-of-featurette titled “Clapping for the Wrong Reasons,” an installation at the new Rough Trade NYC store, and, finally, a 76-page, four-act screenplay that shares a title with the album. The star of <i>Because the Internet</i> is “the Boy,” the future estranged son of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a> who gets his kicks trolling celebrities online and hosting mansion parties that only serve to amplify a nagging loneliness. The story tracks the Boy’s helpless, irrational descent to his own undoing. Viewed through the lens of the album and screenplay, Gambino’s pre-release antics may have even been part of a long con to tease the themes of the project out into the real world.</p>
<p>If you’re fleet enough of a reader, the sequential song prompts in the screenplay reveal the album to be less of a stand-alone release than the full-fledged audio component to a daring multi-platform media project whose audio and literary wings collude to complement and even explain each other. “II. Worldstar” begins as a blippy trap number and takes a hard left on a found-sound fight sequence before landing on a psychedelic chamber jazz coda all because of a club night gone wrong in the play’s first act. Unfortunately, as the play begins to lurch with purpose the album resolves to allow the screenplay to do the heavy lifting. The third and final acts of the album are ill-served by the hairpin shifts in action they’re meant to soundtrack, and in the process, we get a series of jerky, very literal advance-the-plot numbers like “The Party” and “No Exit” followed by over-long, mournful fare like “I. Flight of the Navigator” and “II. Zealots of Stockholm (Free Information)”, songs that are well-timed and appropriate in the context of the multi-platform project but don’t make much sense without the screenplay. It’s all very ambitious, but experiencing <i>Because the Internet</i> as the artist intended requires an hour of fully plugged in attentive reading, embedded Youtube clip viewing, and listening.</p>
<p>On its own, <i>Because the Internet</i>’s album component breaks a number of Childish Gambino’s poor rap habits. Glover’s mic skills have radically improved since the last few outings, and his delivery is quite often formidable. The bouts of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye</a>, Drake, and Lil Wayne tribute that assailed earlier efforts are mercifully absent. He seems to have found his own voice. <i>Royalty</i>’s injurious guest overload is scaled back in service to showcasing Gambino’s newfound mic control, so that all of the guests here are assigned hook detail. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18105-chance-the-rapper-acid-rap/"" target=""_blank"">Chance the Rapper</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29999-azealia-banks/"" target=""_blank"">Azealia Banks</a>, Problem, and Mystikal all creep into the picture alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29817-lloyd/"" target=""_blank"">Lloyd,</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel/"" target=""_blank"">Miguel</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29698-jhene-aiko/"" target=""_blank"">Jhené Aiko</a>, but barring the Aiko spot on “Pink Toes”, Gambino takes all the verses. It’s a blessing and a curse; Gambino’s gotten rather good at the physical act of rapping, but he can still be a Christmas ham with the wordplay. The album is a minefield of wacka-wacka punchlines, facepalm-inducing hashtag raps and clever-until-you-really-think-about-it puns in spots, hampered periodically by gunk like “In the garage/ I had a menage/ I murdered the vag,” “I got no patience, cause I’m not a doctor/ Girl, why are you lyin’? Girl, why you Mufasa?,” “Yeah, you got some silverware, but really, are you eating, though?” and my favorite, “Tia and Tamera in my bed, I’m a Smart Guy.” (If you’re Smart Guy Taj Mowry, and Tia and Tamera are in your bed, you’re not getting any action. They’re your sisters.)</p>
<p>With Gambino’s wordplay ping-ponging from caustic wit to message board snark, the enduring strength of the album is its production. Gambino and Göransson handle the bulk of it here alongside usual suspect Stefan Ponce and alley oops from twin act Christian Rich and Flying Lotus associate Thundercat. <i>Because the Internet</i>’s production team not only ensures the sounds are pretty, spacey, and jarring in all the right places, but they also effortlessly nail the album’s <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>/<i>Wizard of Oz</i> synchronicity gambit. “III. Telegraph Ave. (‘Oakland’ by Lloyd)” kicks off with a tinny fragment of a Lloyd song bellowing out of a radio station and opens up into a full blown Gambino R&amp;B showcase. (Glover might be a better singer than a rapper now, as tracks like “Telegraph Ave.” and the curt, exquisite “III. Urn” regularly bear out.) Following in lock step with the screenplay, you learn that it’s a <i>Secret Life of Walter Mitty</i> style bout of impassioned karaoke to a song that nails the protagonist’s station in life a touch too closely. It’s not only the album’s best song; Gambino’s hook writing nearly bests guys we’d previously thought him to mimic, and he slides masterfully into and out of a cogent sixteen on the back end. It’s also a fulfilling payoff for bothering with the totality of Gambino’s project in the first place, a gobstopping execution of a lofty idea.</p>
<p>When the parts here come together you can catch a glimpse of Glover’s ambitious plan fully realized, but these moments run scarce the further into the project you trudge. This is saying nothing of the risky outlying assumption that everyone interested in the new Childish Gambino album is also interested in (or aware of) the new Childish Gambino screenplay you’re meant read online alongside it. <i>Because the Internet</i> is a nobly expansive attempt at plumbing the catacombs of social media for meaning and exploring the gap between the performative avatars we present as our online selves and the offline realities of our lives, but like the Twitter hounds and comment section warriors it speaks to and about, it could ultimately do well with a little less multitasking.</p></div>"|18817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18817-childish-gambino-because-the-internet/|5.8|Craig Jenkins

The past few months have seen the release of a spirited if sloppy full-length, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18044-the-fall-re-mit/"" target=""_blank""><i>Re-Mit</i></a>; at least two live albums (the latest of which is simply called <i>Live</i>, presumably because Mark E. Smith has run out of titles); and now, that relatively rare beast in the Fall canon, an EP of all new material. And despite the leftovers its title implies, <i>The Remainderer</i> is actually being touted by the band’s label as “a bridging point” between <i>Re-Mit</i> and yet another new album coming in 2014.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s strange to hear any Fall release described in relation to what’s come before and what will come after. The Fall don't so much logically evolve on an album-by-album basis as randomly mutate. Even in those rare periods of line-up consistency—as Smith has enjoyed with his current charges for the past five years—the sound, form, and quality of any particular Fall record seems to be a matter of pure happenstance, dependent on nothing so much as how many pints were swilled on the way to the studio, or if all the players involved had a proper breakfast. Of course, we all know that Mark E. Smith is the Fall, but the Fall is not just Mark E. Smith, and, as ever, their success is dependent on those magical moments when Smith’s free-ranging ramble serendipitously interlocks with his group’s wandering rhythms and pin-prick riffs.</p>
<p>More than anything, <i>The Remainderer</i> is an encouraging sign that stability has yet to ossify into stagnation with this ongoing iteration of the band, who formidably exercise their elasticity over the course of these six wildly divergent tracks. But we’re eased in on familiar footing, with an inviting title track that tumbles down the stairs like a cousin to “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDzmA20URAE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Classical</a>”, and thus feels very much like the sort of Fall song Pavement would’ve tried to rewrite <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOStqtwmD6s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in their Gary Young days</a>; only Smith’s recently developed affinity for frog-throated, guttural grunts betrays it as a product of 2013. It’s a mode of vocaliziation that, for better or worse, Smith is dead-set on embracing in his golden years: “Amorator!” is less a song than a slurred, spoken-word spiel set to a droning, unwavering punkabilly skitter; “Touchy Pad” is a tortured, tuneless duet with keyboardist/wife Elena Poulou, despite its tasteful, acoustic-based arrangement. And though “Rememberance ‘R’” is hardly the first Fall song that wants to be “I Wanna Be Your Dog”, it actually gets more interesting once a wheezing Smith steps away from the mic, and has engineer Simon “Ding” Archer let loose with a rant about some unnamed reunited rock band’s sense of entitlement.</p>
<p>But when Smith actually takes the time to hork out whatever loogie is lodged in his esophagus, he’s in top form: the car-crash medley of “Say Mama/Race With the Devil” makes for a great, grease-stained companion to the Fall’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef_W4uc66lM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">better known, more polished Gene Vincent cover</a>, while “Mister Rode” boasts a classic Smithian see-saw chorus—“I got a name!/ I got a face!”—over a pleasingly meandering, bass-battered groove that builds into a surprisingly dramatic (by Fall standards) fuzzed-out finale. Ultimately, the only thing that really connects <i>The Remainderer</i> to <i>Re-Mit</i> is a similar, slightly above average hit-to-miss ratio, though the abbreviated format works to its advantage. At the very least, you now know what to get for the miserable bastard on your holiday shopping list.</p></div>"|18816.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18816-the-fall-remainderer-ep/|6.9|Stuart Berman

More and more, though, they're getting in on the game themselves. Hotly-tipped NYC label UNO and heretofore unknown singer <a href=""https://twitter.com/IanIsiah"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ian Isiah</a> are the next entrants, with a mixtape full of beats that'd turn Tricky Stewart's head and charismatic vocals drowned in AutoTune. Backed up by a host of well-loved producers like Sinjin Hawke, Brenmar, and ShyGuy, it's hard not to see parallels with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31712-kelela/"" target=""_blank"">Kelela</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18661-kelela-cut-4-me/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cut 4 Me</i></a>. Isiah is another relatively new singer finding his personality in music cribbed from a thriving underground he's long been associated with (in this case, loosely, NYC's GHE20 G0THIK crew). Lacking Kelela's smouldering personality and her clever songwriting, Isiah instead resorts to a loving pastiche of artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"" target=""_blank"">The-Dream</a> and Trey Songz—which, when it works, is hard to deny.</p>
<p>The first we heard from Isiah was April's stark ballad ""Mindfuck"", but that one didn't predict the brittle AutoTune-core of <i>The Love Champion</i>. Subtlety evidently isn't part of Isiah's vocabulary, and it's difficult to gauge how self-aware he is of his own absurdity. Chanting ""pop that juicy on me"" like a mantra on ""Sweat"", he sounds too earnest to be joking. Thankfully for him, that earnestness ends up his saving grace—his honey-hued voice manages to elevate most of his cringe-worthy phrases. When he croons ""trippin on the x/ makin' sweet sex"" over a near-silent backdrop on ""Private Party"", it's more sensual than its blunt language should be able to get across. But then not even he can save the awful ""Dynamite"", a mess of a song centred around trills of ""booty, booty/ you a cutie"" that feel like they were flown in from the bridge of a different track.</p>
<p>Isiah finds a sweet spot with AutoTune on <i>Love Champion</i> that's gently experimental without descending into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a>-esque blubbery, though it could still get on your nerves if you're not one for its inhuman tones. The way he cascades and layers his vocals on tracks like ""Showtime"" or the stunning ballad ""So High"" is surprisingly bewitching, like an art in itself. Not to mention that he's a capable singer on his own, mining an entirely different vibe than Future's warbly emo-rap—but like that rapper and his hordes of imitators, the plugin also gives those ballads an alien, almost otherworldly tin. His battle cry ""I just wanna be high with you"" sounds almost transcendent here.</p>
<p>As much as Isiah relies on his trusty studio helper, however, <i>The Love Champion</i> leans even harder on his cast of producer friends, who offer up a gently progressive selection of beats that sway and dip perfectly with his voice. Sometimes it's hard to tell to who's supposed to be the star—more often than not he's given a prime amount of space for his elaborate countermelodies, but a slinky Sinjin Hawke percussion drop or Brenmar break is never that far behind. UNO's secret weapon <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31026-gobby/"" target=""_blank"">Gobby</a> even shows up on the gorgeously gossamer title track, one of the relentlessly weird producer's prettiest productions.</p>
<p>It's the lesser-known Shy Guy who stands out above the rest. His ""That Body"" struts with all the easy gliding bombast of a Just Blaze track, has Isiah's most effortless vocals and is even blessed with an unusually effusive (albeit brief) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30309-mykki-blanco/"" target=""_blank"">Mykki Blanco</a> verse. The rapper's throaty voice cuts right through Isiah's computerized croon, and with guest spots from him and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30311-le1f/"" target=""_blank"">Le1f</a>, you can tell that Isiah keeps interesting company. His own art still seems content to revel in precedent rather than break down boundaries, however. With endearing but bordering-on-self-parody lyrics, lush production, and a high-pitched voice, Isiah lives in the shadow of The-Dream much like The-Dream lives in the shadow of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2385-r-kelly/"" target=""_blank"">R. Kelly</a>. But unlike our beloved Terius, Isiah has yet to find his own voice. If nothing else <i>Love Champion, </i>marks a solid starting point rather a true takeoff.</p></div>"|18805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18805-ian-isiah-the-love-champion/|6.6|Andrew Ryce

For instance, the album didn't spring from the mind of Blackie Lawless before he bound himself to the law of God, speaking of himself as a carnivorous animal conquering his scantily clad prey. Nor does it resemble the drugged-out rape fantasies and over-the-top depictions of Cemetery Rapist and legions of other “pornogrind” bands, who take the lack of subtlety in metal and beat it into absolute zero. And <i>Lust</i> is certainly not among the many revenge stories that a great deal attempted, but only Type O Negative's Peter Steele had any skill in visualizing (“freelance gynocology” from “Unsuccessfully Coping with the Natural Beauty of Infidelity”<span style=""font-style: normal;""> is still one of the funniest phrases of all time).</span></p>
<p>Instead, Daniel Butler, Vastum's vocalist and lyricist, takes a grisly look at erotic tension at its most extreme. The results are more squeamish than Cannibal Corpse's “Fucked With a Knife”. In <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16152-vastum-3-am-in-agony/"" target=""_blank"">“3 AM in Agony”</a>, he speaks from the point of view of a sexual assault victim, whose “object of my affection, the source of my agony” is sleeping nearby. The perpetrator is “unaware that his friction creates the sensation of a thousand interstitial blades down my center.” Just reading those lines is unsettling; Butler's oration makes it feel almost too real. The title track shows Butler entering the darkest corners of his imagination, opening with “Spill your seed into my father's tears/ his suffering all over my body” and then laying into said father's guts for discomforting warmth. By making even the most disgustingly surreal seam somewhat plausible, Vastum's lyrical content goes beyond most bands of their ilk.</p>
<p><i>Lust</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">'s overall lyrical outlook could be summed up in the last lines of “Incel”: “Mere echos of delight/ A distant mockery of joy/ unconsummated acts consume body and mind/ A prison of what could but never will be/ Hopeless ugly destructive self.” A subject normally discussed with glee and passion, turned into a never-ending labyrinth of loss and uncertainty. These themes are galvanized by Paolo Girardi's artwork. Girardi, who's having a banner year (Lycus' </span><i>Tempest</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> being his crowning achievement), is the ideal visual counterpart—he's a classically influenced Francis Bacon, blurring the line between fine art and heat-stroked, pill-popped hallucination.</span></p>
<p>Vastum is often spoken in relation to their sister band, Acephalix, primarily because the groups share Butler, bassist Luca Indrio, and until recently, guitarist Kyle House (Adam Perry, who drummed on <i>Lust</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, also left the group before the album's release). </span><i>Carnal Law</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, Vastum's debut, was often described as a “slower Acephalix” and while that's true to some extent</span><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, on <i>Lust</i> the band make strides to carve an identity for themselves. Swedish influences are evident</span><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, but while Acephalix were often dubiously lumped in with “Entombedcore,” Vastum take more from Grave and Dismember's less breakneck aspects. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Guitarist </span>Leila Abdul-Rauf, who also plays in the Bay Area groups Hammers of Misfortune and Amber Asylum, is more apt to let a solo ride than hurry to the next verse, and <span style=""font-style: normal;"">Vastum's rushes come more from stretching riffs out, as evident on the thunderous opening to “Repulsive Arousal”. (Combined with a buried tremolo riff and chanting, that track resembles diSEMBLOWELMENT at their finest.) While Butler has long shed the punk from his approach, his voice isn't touched with reverb the way it is with Acephalix. Vastum's style works in the tandem with the lyrical content. There's more space for reflection, or disgust, or, as the band would probably want it, both. “Agony” deals with the most immediately physical lyrics, and as such, it's the fastest track on the record.</span></p>
<p><i>Lust</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> was one of the last albums that Bay Area metal and punk stawart Jeff “Jef Leppard” Davis<i> </i></span><span>worked on before his death last year following a motorcycle accident. Greg Wilkinson took over production following Davis' death, and he honors Davis' style by creating an old-school metal atmosphere with modern volume. </span><i>Lust</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, in addition to being one of the most interesting metal releases of 2013, serves as a artistically fulfilling coda for Davis' handiwork.</span></p></div>"|18765.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18765-vastum-patricidal-lust/|7.9|Andy O'Connor

Zachary Cale's mesmerizing finger-picking, drawing on open-string drone and country blues tunings, wanders restlessly around a clean, well-lit place of a mix, synths humming like 3am refrigerators and chiming guitars confusing your sense of middle distance. It is a misty, gorgeous record, a space that feels wonderful to roam around in.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The second is the delicacy and exquisite loneliness of Cale's guitar playing. He has said in interviews that he'd rather not be aligned with folk music—""To me, folk music is something sacred, <span class=""null"">something that people today don’t have any business singing</span>,"" he told the blog <a href=""http://underneaththis.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/musician-interview-zachary-cale/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Underneath This</a> in March—but the virtues of his playing are folk virtues, especially the ability to serve as his own rhythm section. Every one of <i>Blue Rider</i>'s songs  appears to feature at least three guitarists simultaneously; it's all Cale, working live. You are forcefully reminded, listening the counter-layers of something like ""Hold Fast"" or ""Wayward Son"", that acoustic solo music is only as simple as you make it.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">At the center of the crystalline tangle sits Cale, a singer-songwriter who's been hiding in plain sight for awhile<i>—Blue Rider</i> is his fourth album. He's less quizzically arch than Destroyer, less cryptically moody than Cass McCombs. But there is a similar inscrutable poetry in his music, and the impassive <i>Blue Rider</i> is his most beguiling collection. He has some of Bejar's vocal timbre and some of McCombs's tilted-dog's-head relationship to language: The way that McCombs asked, teasingly, ""What does it mean to be a man?"" repeatedly on ""Big Wheel"" is the way that Cale sings lines like ""Lover, for you my heart beats strong."" He speaks them haltingly, as if he is testing the words in his mouth as much as he is puzzling over their meanings.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Cale sings these lines through a half-closed mouth, his consonants blurring into the soft curves of the sound, which means that a wry line like ""Well, the past is still the past, he can visit anytime/ Nothing's really changed except a few road signs"" (""Hold Fast"") might initially slide past you unnoticed. But Cale's imagery flashes sharp and dreamlike across his songs once you tune to it—""Shadows walk across a jagged sky,"" he sings on ""Hangman's Letters"", a dark, alarming image. On ""Noise Of Welcome"", he muses ""What does it mean to die in my dreams?"" It's a question with a day-tripper's ring to it, but Cale has built the perfect environment for languorous thoughts like this. <i>Blue Rider</i> is short—eight songs, 35 minutes—but it slows everything down around it while's playing, coaxing half-formed feelings out of their corners and giving them space to exist.</p></div>"|18807.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18807-blue-rider/|7.9|Jayson Greene

<p>[“Yeahhhhh,” an audience member interjects.]</p>
<p>“It’s about what happens when you start getting high, and you find out that people you thought you knew, you don’t know anymore, because they don’t get high and you do.”</p>
<p>That banter, dripping with irony and accompanied by shrieking scrapes of a piano’s strings, forebodingly introduces the finale of the latest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young</a> archival release, <i>Live at the Cellar Door</i>. “Flying on the Ground is Wrong”, one of Young’s earliest songs, is a typically 60s piece of pharmacological us vs. them, a bittersweet song about how the squares just don’t understand the new mind-expanding potential of drugs. But even if the audience didn’t quite pick up on it on this December night, it’s not exactly a celebration anymore for Young by 1970.</p>
<p>The first line of “The Needle and the Damage Done”, which would start appearing in setlists the next month, is “I caught you knocking at my cellar door.” If the song is in fact referencing the famous, tiny D.C. club, it’s most likely not about these 1970 shows, but rather the 1969 run with Crazy Horse and the worsening heroin addiction of guitarist Danny Whitten. But amidst an accumulation of dark, druggy vibes, this solo acoustic set catches Young in a bleak, hollow mood, rudely awoken from the hippie dream his audience still wants to believe.</p>
<p>If this all sounds familiar, it’s because only seven weeks separated the Cellar Door shows and another Archives release: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9984-live-at-massey-hall/"" target=""_blank"">the superb January 1971 set</a> at Toronto’s Massey Hall Young freed from his vaults six years prior. A full seven of the 13 songs on <i>Live at the Cellar Door</i> also appear on the Massey Hall release, but these two shows still exist on opposing sides of a notable chapter break in Young’s career and life. While Massey Hall looked forward to his commercial peak of <i>Harvest</i>, showcasing then-unheard songs such as “Heart of Gold” in their infancy, <i>Live at the Cellar Door</i> is mostly looking back to his previous two albums, <i>After the Gold Rush</i> and <i>Everybody Knows This is Nowhere</i>, and his late work with Buffalo Springfield.</p>
<p>Between the two shows, Young threw out his back on his ranch, picked up a painkiller habit, and started his turbulent relationship with actress Carrie Snodgrass (as chronicled in “A Man Needs a Maid” on <i>Harvest</i>). So the Massey and Cellar Door releases offer a sort of before-and-after experiment around this busy holiday break, even if the Live Archives chronology is getting so crowded in this era that this latest release had to be jimmied in as Volume 2.5.</p>
<p>But <i>Live at the Cellar Door</i> stands alone as an unexpected glimpse of Neil Young, piano man. Between songs, Young makes a long speech in praise of the venue’s “nine-foot Steinway,” an instrument that provides as much of the accompaniment here as guitar. “I’ve been playing piano for about...almost a year,” he says, and whether that’s a joke or not, his rudimentary keyboard approach mirrors the crude immediacy of his electric guitar work more than his subtle acoustic touch.</p>
<p>On the Buffalo Springfield track “Expecting to Fly”—an elegy to the 60s written before the decade was even finished—Young punctuates the chorus with loud discordant pounds that trail off into the silent club’s darkness. The other piano reinvention, surprisingly, is “Cinnamon Girl”, which even Neil obsessives probably have never heard in this arrangement. “That’s the first time I ever did that one on the piano,” Neil says—and possibly the last time as well.</p>
<p>Paired with the equally gloomy Massey Hall, these sibling live sets show Young peeking over the edge of the 60s into the dark chasm of the next decade. It’s frustrating that the Archives series continues to pace along this precipice instead of taking the plunge into the next rich stretch of Young’s career: More material from the <i>Harvest</i> tour that begat the tormented <i>Time Fades Away</i>? The haunted/stoned Bottom Line show from 74? The short-lived Ducks? But even if it holds the most value for the Neil obsessives interested in the small differences, <i>Live at Cellar Door</i> provides another glimpse at a darkly formative time in his long career.</p></div>"|18757.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18757-neil-young-live-at-the-cellar-door/|7.7|Rob Mitchum

You think of things like filling contracts, overcoming writers block, maybe doing a favor for an old friend. And Sometimes you get a couple of decent songs out of it. But <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52363-listen-xiu-xiu-take-on-nina-simones-dont-smoke-in-bed-for-simone-covers-album/"" target=""_blank"">hearing</a> that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4683-xiu-xiu/"" target=""_blank"">Xiu Xiu</a> would be covering songs identified with Nina Simone on a new release, it was hard not get excited. There’s an obvious spiritual connection between the artists, a sense of fearlessness and deep belief in the transformative power of expressing raw emotion. Looking at the titles, I could close my eyes and almost hear how some of these songs would play out. Sure, it would be a challenge. Nina Simone is giant, an artist of great complexity whose music is hard to grapple with and harder still to summarize, so there would be the question of <i>which</i> Nina Simone to cover: the jazz belter, the ethereal balladeer, the bold activist, the shattered lover, the gifted interpreter of the American songbook. But you could imagine Jamie Stewart finding a way to channel his frayed edges and matchless intensity into something powerful that would highlight something about Simone’s many-faceted approach. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Alas, it was not to be. <i>Nina</i> is a low-key release that is not ""the new Xiu Xiu album"" but it’s still hard not to be disappointed at this wasted opportunity. If it were too abrasive or too faithful, that would be one thing, but<i> Nina</i> is guilty of an even deeper sin: These interpretations shed no light on Simone’s artistry and add nothing to the force of these songs. The strangest thing of all is that the failure is due almost entirely to Stewart’s vocal conception. He doesn’t have the widest range as a singer, but he has found ways to circumvent his limitations and find modes of expression to suit his songs. And he also has a deep bag of effects—shrieks, cries, howls, and even an engaging croon that hints at blackest goth and the androgyny of new pop. But for whatever reason he chose to sing these 11 songs almost entirely with a pinched, trembling whisper that makes melody irrelevant while not offering any compensatory emotional gestures. It’s a deeply theatrical register, sounding put-on and ""artificial"" in a way that has to be intentional, but it never signifies. You keep waiting for the songs to lurch in an unexpected direction but they never do; <i>Nina </i>is a low simmer that never comes close to approaching a boil. </p>
<p class=""p1"">There are a few things to recommend here. One, Stewart’s song selection is pretty good, even if he never finds a way to do much with them.""Wild Is the Wind"" and ""The Other Woman"" are brilliant tunes that Simone owned, and her versions of ""Don’t Explain"" and ""Pirate Jenny"" are essential versions of frequently covered classics. So just hearing the songs he chose—most of which, incidentally, Simone did not write—and trying to hear how he connects them to her interpretations and tweaks lyrics here and there to personalize them holds some parlor game interest. And the arrangements by drummer Ches Smith are distinctive and varied, moving between music-box twinkle, Tom Waits-style junkyard jazz, and harsh atonal bleats. There's an interesting <i>sound </i>here, a shell of an idea. But there is ultimately very little melody or personality for the arrangements to support and the record winds up sounding weirdly conservative. </p></div>"|18762.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18762-xiu-xiu-nina/|4.7|Mark Richardson

It begins with the sound itself: the shimmering, orgasmic post-Moroder synth patterns of Cowley’s early 80s dancefloor anthems like “X-Factor” and “Get A Little”, and of course the tantric splendour of his 1982 remix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1185-donna-summer/"" target=""_blank"">Donna Summer</a>’s “I Feel Love”. Sex also is the music’s thematic preoccupation, to the point of fixation, reflecting the deep interpenetration of disco and gay bathhouses in late 1970s San Francisco, Cowley’s transplanted home: “Menergy” celebrates “the boys in the bedroom/ lovin’ it up/ shootin’ off energy.” In 1982, Cowley was one of the first public figures to pass away from complications associated with AIDS (before it was even known by that name), a tragic denouement partly captured in the disoriented and shadowed electro-disco of his final album, <i>Mind Warp</i>. It’s fitting, then, that the first concrete attempt to canonise Cowley as an electronic music auteur and innovator comes in the form of a compilation of soundtrack work for gay pornographic films. <i>School Daze </i>collects, for the first time on CD, instrumental work dating from 1973 to 1981, given by Cowley to gay porn production company Fox Studio, the majority finding their way into the films <i>School Daze </i>and <i>Muscle Up</i>.</p>
<p>The standard line on Cowley is that he is a post-Moroder producer, bridging the gap between 1970s euro-disco and 1980s Hi-NRG. It’s a neat story, but there have always been loose ends that it cannot make sense of, like Cowley’s astonishing production work for Sylvester’s 1979 track “I Need Somebody To Love Tonight”, a visionary collision of burbling synthesisers and lilting dub (available footage of the film <i>School Daze </i>features a mind-altering, woozy instrumental remix not included here). Further complications were offered by the reissue of Cowley’s late 1970s work with Jorge Socarros as Catholic, all jerky synthetic new wave whose fusion of Roxy Music and Kraftwerk anticipates the early work of Simple Minds. <i>School Daze </i>completes the picture by tying together all these threads and taking them somewhere else again, suggesting that Moroder was not the origin for Cowley, but the streamlined destination. The “1973-1981” timeframe is as bewildering as was the “85-92” in the title of Aphex Twin’s first <i>Selected Ambient Works</i>: even if this music all had originated from the early 80s, it would for the most part sound amazingly ahead of its time.</p>
<p>There’s a handful of tracks in modes you might expect—“Zygote” is adrenalized cosmic disco, while the title track offers corpulent funk-rock—but <i>School Daze </i>mostly consists of expansive, meditative soundscapes whose ambiguous titles (“Nightcrawler”, “Out of Body”, “Tides of Man”) capture their simultaneous evocation of the intimate and the intergalactic, the immediacy of bodily sensation and the depths of deep space. A few deserve special mention. The 16-minute “Seven Sacred Pools” is luxuriantly expansive ambient dub that could fit onto Orb’s <i>Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld</i>, its heart-murmur bass and multi-tiered synth melodies embracing and decoupling in an eerie underwater consummation. The forbidding “Journey Home” is scraping metallic techno in slow motion, weaving together machinic sound effects with a recurrent didgeridoo bassline with exacting precision. The chiming, swirling “Primordial Landscape” starts off shadowy and restless, fusing Caribbean bounce with funereal dirge, before ascending to the ceiling with iridescent chime loops that prefigure Manuel Göttsching’s proto-techno masterpiece <i>E2-E4</i>. But whereas the electronic music which Cowley flashes forward to is mostly preternaturally bright and sharp, the arrangements here feel flushed and hazy, shadowed by the torpor of dope and the blood-rush delirium of amyl nitrate.</p>
<p>It’s not necessary to frame <i>School Daze </i>by the use to which these compositions originally were put, but it helps. In <i>The Rise and Fall of Gay Culture</i>, Daniel Harris writes that gay pornographers of the 1970s “believed they were filming two people, not in the act of fucking, but of merging, of coalescing, a process that involved the dissolution of their separate physical identities as they melted together, losing their definition as individuals.” Cowley’s music here captures exactly that vibe, its slow tempos, meandering arrangements, and persistent sense of disorientation and self-alienation evokes the world of San Francisco bathhouses rather than dancefloors. To listen is to step down those same long, dark tunnels: physical spaces of random encounters and depersonalised unions; psychological spaces of intoxication and longing.</p></div>"|18773.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18773-patrick-cowley-school-daze/|8.3|Tim Finney

It's a role that, between managing a prolific release schedule and selecting producers out of what amounts to a little black book of underground dance misfits, requires a bit more creative agency than your average label head. <i>Spit</i>, Morelli's first music under his own name, appears hell-bent on separating the man from the hailstorm of narrative and praise surrounding his label. It arrives via Hospital Productions, 36 minutes of ill-at-ease industrial simmer whose length, construction, and tenor defy the type of romantic, back-to-basic engagement that L.I.E.S. inspires.</p>
<p>There is nothing nice about <i>Spit</i>. The album title was inspired by a neighborhood Morelli lived in, one in which hookers would ""smoke cigarettes, read the paper, talk on their cell phones, and spit. They would spit...a lot."" So not just spit, but ""hooker spit,"" which should give you a window into the tension, claustrophobia, and foulness that infect Morelli's music. <i>Spit</i> is dark, more so than the glut of industrial-leaning techno and eerie machine music Morelli has dug up for L.I.E.S. Those works often had expanse on their side: they're long, winding tracks that, however noisy, could engender mystery or psychedelic escape. <i>Spit</i>, in comparison, trudges through its eight tracks: fed up, exhausted, grim. When asked why he didn't release his album on his own label, he <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2013/11/15/interview-ron-morelli/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">responded</a> tersely: ""Dom[inick Fernow, head of Hospital Productions] simply proposed I make a record for him. If he did not ask, then I would not have done it."" Ok, then.</p>
<p>This sense of duty and drudgery comes to life on scraping, hissy tracks such as ""Sledgehammer II"" and ""Slow Down"". Ugly, metal-on-metal machine music, <i>Spit</i> is rhythmic in nature, but not as dance-oriented as much of the L.I.E.S. output. I don't think the tired, delayed claps and barely-there acid bassline of ""Modern Paranoia"" want to make anyone dance; they're exhausted, it was a long day, they need a beer and a shot. They're very much at home with the noir-ish menace of Hospital Productions-affiliated acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30495-vatican-shadow/"">Vatican Shadow</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30695-silent-servant/"">Silent Servant</a>.</p>
<p>If you squint hard enough you can find some playfulness in <i>Spit</i>, in the way pitched toms hop around in the background of ""Crack Microbes"" or in ""Director Of…""'s garbled, beatless trip. The album's centerpiece, in placement if not tone, is ""Fake Rush"", a nervy, light-on-its-feet stew of rhythmic oscillations. Were it not for its bit-reduced crunch and battery-acid exterior, ""Fake Rush"" could've come from one of London's many young bass manglers, especially as it clocks a heart-racing 140 bpm when it's not wandering around drunkenly in half-time.</p>
<p>It's hard to truly love an album that seems a constant threat to shiv you, though, and while <i>Spit</i>'s economy prevents it from careening into pure aggression, it remains irritated throughout. This feels by design, and it's easy to read <i>Spit</i> as a reaction to all of the love poured on L.I.E.S. of late. More likely, <i>Spit</i> represents another of Morelli's inspirations, after several collaborative projects. (On the process of making the album, he <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2013/11/28/im-just-disgusted-by-humanity-l-i-e-s-boss-ron-morelli-talks-spit-clubs-and-itunes/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">offers</a>, ""[Y]<span>ou’re working in a tried and true format and throwing your own shitty take on what has been done by the masters years ago."")</span> There's enough on offer that its tone can be forgiven, perhaps, but there are going to be plenty of nights when <i>Spit</i> just wants to be left alone, and you'll be inclined to grant it as much.</p></div>"|18780.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18780-ron-morelli-spit/|6.2|Andrew Gaerig

It all began with a 2011 EP, spilled into a well-received 2012 debut, and saw the emergence of two shorter releases earlier this year before culminating in the unique horror that is <i>Omen Ex Simulacra</i>. Not a bad track record for a pair forced to surmount the distance between Oregon and Illinois in order to achieve their thoroughly apocalyptic vision, especially given the unassailable quality of their burgeoning discography. Their second album continues in the same vein as its more organic-minded predecessor, but sees the band retreat even deeper into madness. Multi-instrumentalist and noisemonger Matron Thorn (Benighted in Sodom, Bethlehem) and vocalist Ascaris (Shavasana, ex-Velnias) have ramped up the intensity to an almost uncomfortable level.</p>
<p>At first blush, Ævangelist seem fairly straight forward; fundamentally a black/death metal band, crossing the former’s atmospheric shudder with the latter’s blunt-force approach. If only it were that simple; black/death bands are par for the extreme metal course, but a band like this one only rears its ugly head once in a long while. Anaal Nathrakh’s ""<i>Total Fucking Necro</i>/<i>Codex Necro</i> era, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23036-deathspell-omega/"" target=""_blank"">Deathspell Omega</a>’s atonal explorations, and even the ghost of Gorguts’ riff-mangling weirdness may serve as signposts, but ultimately, Ævangelist walk alone. From opener “Veils<i>”</i> muffled, threatening first moments of factory noise, disembodied screams, and clattering electronic drumbeats until the lurching dread of “Abysscape”, the listener is confronted by claustrophobia, fear, and naked aggression.</p>
<p>The electronic and industrial elements are even more pronounced this time around, with the ever-present drum machine holding court over a heavily mechanized infernal soundscape. The songs bleed into one another, largely homogenous save for unexpected horrors like the violent scrapings of violin on “Seclusion” that render once-beautiful strings into wailing captives. The inhuman percussion is never far out of earshot, and blends surprisingly seamlessly with the distorted riffs to present a united, uncompromising front. Storms of harsh noise roll overtop, manipulated and orchestrated with sadistic intent. Matron Thorns’ moaning synths twist into a phantom woman’s screams roiling under animalistic growls and merciless machinery; the sound is of defilement, of a devouring.<i> Omen Ex Simulacra</i> attacks its hapless victim like a ravenous beast, its nostrils filled with the scent of blood, intent on nothing but destruction.</p>
<p>The most organic aspect of the recording, the vocalist, lay buried, corpselike, beneath the surface. These vocals are impressive and commanding. Ascaris snarls and gags like a rabid animal, varying his range from subterranean guttural roars to grotesque howls. His voice, as demonic and burdened by effects as it may be, is the closest thing to humanity that Ævangelist are willing to offer. They eschew the occult ephemera of so many others in favor of the much more frightening gods of emptiness, nothingness, and despair. The hell they inhabit was created by an uncaring and blood-drunk shadow, but their end-time visions are not biblical; they prophesize that most wretched of ends, one of slow decay, sinking earth, and enfeebled dissolution wrought by man and machine.</p>
<p>For all its intensity, the album is no short sharp shock. Your punishment is meted out in measured blasts. Meaning, alas, it is long, painfully long—the torment stretches on and on, prolonging the agony past an hour’s time, further proof that these men want you to suffer as they suffer. Hell, they probably want you to suffer far more, though some editing would've provided a more impressive display of their unique aural violence.</p></div>"|18776.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18776-vangelist-omen-ex-simulacra/|7.0|Kim Kelly

Kelly</a> never really went away, but in 2013 he has crept back into pop culture nonetheless. He spent the summer headlining large summer festivals, basking in the glow of fans singing his discography back to him. He managed to—if even for a moment—usurp <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a> at Coachella <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50321-listen-to-r-kelly-perform-with-phoenix-at-coachella/"" target=""_blank"">during the encore of Phoenix’s closing set</a>, belting out the opening notes of “Bump N’ Grind” to a dead silent crowd waiting for a curtain to drop and reveal a giant pyramid. He would then appear on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51898-listen-r-kelly-and-phoenix-trying-to-be-cool-remix/"" target=""_blank"">remix of the Frenchies’ “Trying To Be Cool”</a> and later on tracks by Justin Bieber (“PYD”) and Lady Gaga. The latter collaboration—the deliciously slinky “Do What U Want”—was a runaway hit that led to appearances on SNL and the American Music Awards, both of which were easily Kelly’s most high-profile television looks in half a decade.</p>
<p>It has been a fun year for the 46-year-old, an unexpected and smooth resurgence at a time when it looked like he was content to rest in the soft embrace of R&amp;B radio and sold out 5,000 capacity theaters. The nightcap is his 13th solo album <i>Black Panties</i>, which tosses aside the classic soul of his previous two albums (2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14967-love-letter/"" target=""_blank""><i>Love Letter</i></a> and last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16797-write-me-back/"" target=""_blank""><i>Write Me Back</i></a>) for a deep dive into the sounds of contemporary bumping and grinding. For much of the past 10 years, Kelly’s career has been defined by trying to balance his traditionalist roots with a desire to continually update his sound. He has more or less been able to maintain that balance, like on <i>TP3 Reloaded</i> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10293-double-up/"" target=""_blank""><i>Double Up</i></a>, two albums that feature a number of regrettable collaborations (The Game? Kid Rock??) but also a handful of his most indelible tracks. But we also saw the singer reek of desperation on 2009’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13790-untitled/"" target=""_blank""><i>Untitled</i></a>, a drab and misguided album slathered in AutoTune that is inarguably the low point of his career.</p>
<p><i>Black Panties</i> establishes a third position. There is no “I’m a Flirt (Remix)” or “Same Girl” or “Trapped in the Closet” here, standout singles that rejigger his entire career. There are also few if any profoundly novel album cuts—be it anything as truly outlandish as “The Zoo” or effortlessly tuneful as “Kickin’ It With Your Girlfriend” or “Freaky in the Club”—that quietly register as some of his best work. Instead, <i>Black Panties</i> is thematically coherent and consistently listenable, not unlike <i>Love Letter</i> in that sense, though of course different in just about every other.</p>
<p>The album is almost exclusively about pussy—which, duh, R. Kelly. No one has sung as prolifically about pussy as the man whose debut album sports a nearly seven minute long song called “I Like the Crotch On You"", and perhaps no one will in our lifetimes. On the one hand, Kells reinforces his identity here: for him, comparing pussy to a cookie (on, well, “Cookie”) is not a one-bar metaphor. It is instead an entire song in which he sings about “lick[ing] the middle like an Oreo.” This is the power of R. Kelly: it will be impossible to eat an Oreo for a while without thinking of cunnilingus. He has fundamentally altered your existence.</p>
<p>There is also something undeniably great about a song like “Marry the Pussy,” in which Kelly gives the song’s subject an entire persona: “Pussy talk to me/Pussy sing to me/ Yeah, so much joy it bring to me.” With a song like this, Kelly allows himself to be more human than the rest of us. It is not ridiculous that he wants to marry a pussy—that level of carnality exists somewhere in all of us, male or female. His brilliance is in routinely bringing out into the open the things that—with good reason!—stay in the darkest corners of our minds. In disrupting the social order, maybe his music helps preserve it as well.</p>
<p>But, in the context of his own discography at least, <i>Black Panties</i> isn’t as gleefully absurd as we’ve come to expect from him. It’s not exactly that every R. Kelly song needs to construct an entire fable (<i>TP3</i>’s “Sex Weed” is a good example of him losing the plot), but that at its best his dirtiest tracks have the frission of the legitimately unexpected—each song has the potential to be its own developed story, or to shock the public anew. With <i>Black Panties</i>, what you see is mostly what you get.</p>
<p>What we get <i>is</i> a pretty good modern R&amp;B album, but it’s also one that feels just a bit fossilized. With its undulating synths, abundance of screwed vocals and slowly churning tempos, <i>Black Panties</i> sounds suspiciously like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"" target=""_blank"">the-Dream</a>’s first two albums. Tracks like “Throw This Money On You” (which is still pretty great) and “Genius” (which is not) sound ripped almost wholesale from the album in which the-Dream wrote a song called “Kelly’s 12 Play"", where he obsessively details fucking to Kelly’s debut album. At times, listening to <i>Black Panties</i> can be like watching the snake eat its own tail. There are also a number of tracks in which Kelly collaborates with current stars like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31455-migos/"" target=""_blank"">Migos</a> (“Show Ya Pussy”) or DJ Mustard (“Spend That”), and though none come off anywhere nearly as poorly as his song with OJ Da Juiceman, there is also an instant loss of individuality that renders them a bit useless.</p>
<p><i>Black Panties</i> concludes with “Shut Up,” in which he condemns critics, haters and ex-friends who declared his career dead. Considering his numerous past transgressions with minors, the song (which is actually about his vocal surgery) is rather tone-deaf, though that is not exactly a new development either. But it does end the album on a defiant note that is as jarring as it is energizing. The Pied Piper of R&amp;B finds himself head over heels in love with pussy, yet he refuses to settle down. Or maybe, that is precisely why he won't.</p></div>"|18812.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18812-r-kelly-black-panties/|6.8|Jordan Sargent

But when <i>Blues People</i> was published, those secular styles—and in particular R&amp;B—were reaching a tipping point. Former gospel artists like Sam Cooke and Aretha Franklin had opened the floodgates for spiritual singers to cross over into the pop market, an exodus that decimated the ranks of the gospel industry. That gospel had become an industry in the first place owed much to various DJs, promoters, and labels like Nashville’s Nashboro Records.</p>
<p>If the new four-disc anthology <i>I Heard the Angels Singing: Electrifying Black Gospel from the Nashboro Label, 1951-1983</i> proves anything, it’s Baraka’s claim that gospel could hold its own against its rivals in terms of intensity and beauty—especially when Nashboro was reaching its own peak. The label was launched in 1951 by jukebox vendor and vinyl retailer Ernest L. Young, who piggybacked on Nashville’s thriving gospel scene (the Grand Ole Oprey’s legendary first home, the Ryman Auditorium, first served as the stomping ground for many of Nashboro’s gospel hitmakers). Three of Nashboro’s first singles—the Silvertone Jubilee Singers’ “Since Jesus Came into My Heart"", The Skylarks’ “There Must Be a City"" and the Cross-Road Singers’ “Sing till the Power of the Lord Comes Down,” all from 1951—already show a range, from skeletal, guitar-and-harmony testimonials to get-happy boogie to striding proto-doo-wop.</p>
<p>Nashboro hit its stride, though, in the late 50s, when rock ’n’ roll augured a new era in the adaptation and acceptance of so-called race music. Branching out quickly to sign acts from all corners of the U.S., the label grew to prominence by sidestepping the limitation of being a strictly regional label—before Motown and Stax proved just how internationally profitable a regional identity could be—and by proactively poaching artists from other gospel labels. Gospel became a business, and Nashboro navigated these deeper waters without diluting their output. One of the label’s cornerstone groups, Philadelphia’s the Angelic Gospel Singers, are represented, albeit sparsely, by the 1958 organ-drenched hymn “I’m Getting Nearer, Pt. 1”; meanwhile another of Nashboro’s top outfits, Miami’s the Consolers, weigh in with their 1957 rendition of “This May Be The Last Time"", an infinitely more bouncy and upbeat take on fatalistic resignation than the Staple Singers’ atmospheric, Rolling Stones-approved version.</p>
<p>The rise of R&amp;B-infused rock ’n’ roll—not to mention R&amp;B itself—in the early 60s resulted in a feedback loop with gospel. By the end of the 60s, though, that loop had become a one-way street; gospel now struggled to catch up and remain relevant in the face of a predominantly churchless youth culture. But rather than sounding like compromise, Nashboro’s output from the 60s split the difference between gospel and soul. Foregoing the word of God altogether, Jonathan Greer’s 1968 instrumental “Gospel Train” relied instead on an exultant, predictably locomotive chug that bristles with fervid devotion. As Nashboro settled into its old age in the late ’70s and early ’80s, tracks like 1973’s “Jesus is My Keeper” by the Morning Stars of Savannah circled the wagons, drawing strongly from the Impressions’ decade-old, gospel-fueled hit, “People Get Ready.” By the time 1977’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DTP4dGLx9w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“It’s Time to Serve the Lord”</a> showed the Bright Stars to be a lightly funky, would-be alternative to a wave of secular R&amp;B that proffered the discotheque as church, Nashboro’s gospel had begun to smell of mothballs—but that doesn’t detract from the stately grace of Willie Neal Johnson and the Gospel Keynotes’ “Bless Me,” the 1983 song that closes <i>I Heard the Angels </i>on an uncharacteristically lush, sumptuous note—a silky, soulful, orchestrated ballad that predicts the gospel-pop crossover that Isley-Jasper-Isley would enjoy two year later with “Caravan of Love"". Nashboro wouldn’t survive to witness that major-label coup, but it couldn’t have happened without the groundwork Nashboro laid.</p>
<p>Not that Nashboro itself didn’t shelter its share of future stars. The Jewel Trio—whose 1958 single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvYAhOjYfPs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Too Late""</a> is included here, transferred from 45 with a hair-raising aura of chanted pleas and crackly groove-dust—features a young Canzetta Staton, yet to find fame on her own as Candi Staton. And Lou Rawls pops up on no less than three tracks by his group the Chosen Gospel Singers: “Trouble of This World’s Condition” from 1956, “Lord Shine on Me” from 1958, and “Let Your Life Speak Out” from 1962. All showcase Rawls’ tender growl, but it’s the last of the three that employs propulsive percussion and lunging passion in a way that makes Rawls’ defection to the secular world all but preordained—as is <i>I Heard the Angels</i>’ success as a single, searing, dynamic sermon, preached at whatever congregation will have it.</p></div>"|18810.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18810-i-heard-the-angels-singing-electrifying-black-gospel/|8.1|Jason Heller

Great, ok, let's get you started. Basically, here are your two options: You can plug that into something (keep it cheap) and warble angrily. Or, you can go acoustic and warble gently. Some people around here, like <a href=""http://davidnovick.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">David Novick</a>, even do both. As a member of San Francisco Water Cooler, he plays abraded, candy-colored garage rock. But last October, he slipped 100 copies of this little self-titled record into the world, under an imprint called Sun Sneeze. It was a small psych-folk Valentine, an ant's cough in the vast universe; recorded on four and eight-track, it was so muffled it barely seemed to exist. But it radiated a strange, beatific energy, the kind that is supposed to be native to this little patch of lysergic territory Novick's tilling, but is often missing. Novick, clearing his throat somewhat, is reissuing it, on the slightly-less-tiny God? imprint, a subsidiary of Drag City. Maybe twice as many people will hear it this time.</p>
<p>In any case, those trying will have to lean forward slightly. The sound is so muffled it appears that it was accidentally recorded in a back-pocket iPhone rather than captured with any degree of intention. Novick's vocals on ""Undo the Knot"" sound like a hesitant early take, done while he was still negotiating how the phases matched up with the changes. Nope; that's it.  </p>
<p>This home recording technique usually tricks us into hearing amateurism—it's an aesthetic, sure, but it's also a handy way to camouflage actual chops. But Novick's guitar playing, emerging from beneath the sonic horse blanket, is inventive, fluid, and often beautiful. The instrumental ""Silver"" builds in layers, adding every eight to 16 bars to its complicated base chord progression, blooming into a gently smudged guitar lead. Despite the sketchy sound and brevity (it's over in less than two minutes), it's one of the most memorable melodies on the album. Even when he's just relaxing in a glimmering pool of reverb, like on the little murmuring instrumental ditty ""Ashtray"", you can hear his fingers thinking.</p>
<p><i>David Novick</i> runs seven songs and less than a half hour, a quickly dissipating smoke ring that you are just getting a whiff of by the time it passes. Novick seems like a devotee of the late-60s British folk underground, the kind of dazed, wispy weirdness that piled up on loving comps like <i>Gather in the Mushrooms</i>. There is plenty of precedent for what Novick is doing right now, too; You can hear hints of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28957-white-fence/"" target=""_blank"">White Fence</a>'s gentle surrealism and Kinks love in ""Undo The Knot"", some of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30852-jessica-pratt/"" target=""_blank"">Jessica Pratt</a>'s pastoral stillness in the becalmed ""Rain."" But Novick stands out even in a glut. Underneath the haze, you get a hint of the cosmic thoughts floating through his mind: ""We are as much of a mystery to Death as God is to us,"" he sings on ""Undo the Knot"". It’s barely audible, but it commands you to lean forward to catch more. </p></div>"|18808.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18808-david-novick-david-novick/|7.1|Jayson Greene

His <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/8901-number-25/2/"">art</a>'s adorned the cover of scores of albums in the past few years, from the underground electronics of the <a href=""http://editionsmego.com/releases/spectrum-spools/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spectrum Spools</a> label to bigger indie releases by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18537-oneohtrix-point-never-r-plus-seven/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16737-lucifer/"">Peaking Lights</a>. His solo project <a href=""http://www.mountaain.com/threeleggedrace/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Three Legged Race</a> put out an excellent debut full-length called <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17485-persuasive-barrier/"">Persuasive Barrier</a></i> earlier this year, followed by another strong <a href=""http://typerecords.com/releases/mercurial-rites-2-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">effort</a> from his long-term noise trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2016-hair-police/"">Hair Police</a>. But until now nothing featuring Beatty’s own music has been released under his given name.</p>
<p>It’s interesting, then, that he chose <i>Soundtracks for Takeshi Murata </i>to be the first official Robert Beatty album, since it’s essentially a collaboration. He made all the music himself, but crafted it to accompany the films of “digital video glitch pioneer” <a href=""http://takeshimurata.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Takeshi Murata</a>. Having to keep Murata’s images in mind would presumably force Beatty to react and stretch, depriving him of complete control. To some extent that is the case: the music here has a less defined and distinct personality than that of Three Legged Race.</p>
<p>But in a way, that’s why it makes sense to label it as the work of Robert Beatty. Where Three Legged Race focuses on a narrower range, <i>Soundtracks for Takeshi Murata </i>gives a greater sense of what Beatty is capable of sonically and thematically. And where <i>Persuasive Barrier </i>was often about restraint,<i> </i>the music here is bigger and broader, painting aural images in bolder, thicker colors. There are solid drones, dense atmospheres, undulating synths, and sound effect-like events that grab attention. There is some restraint too–one track, “Escape Spirit Videoslime”, plays like distant space transmissions–but most of <i>Soundtracks</i> is right up front, ready to fill your ears.</p>
<p>It’s also ready to fill your eyes, or at least the ones in your mind. Beatty, who also makes films and installations along with his prolific cover artwork, has a visual sensibility that’s as strong as his musical instincts. Here that comes across in the way images and motion seem to leap from his sounds. In opener “Cone Eater”, whirring tones and low rumbles conjure a silvery, metallic skyline, while on “Untitled (Silver)” (whose Murata film can be seen <a href=""http://www.ubu.com/film/murata_silver.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>) voice-like echoes and jolts of noise evoke a surreal, burned-out war zone.</p>
<p>What’s particularly impressive about that vividness is the way Beatty achieves it without mimicking Murata. It must’ve been tempting to cut up sound busily in response to Murata’s glitches, but Beatty opts to dole it out in waves, responding more to the fluidity of Murata’s films than their activity. That’s clearest in the album’s centerpiece, a 20-minute accompaniment to Murata’s “Untitled (Pink Dot)”. Starting with a simple, nursery-rhyme-like pattern of notes, Beatty slowly fills the track with ripples and repetitions until it becomes epic, somewhere between the expanses of a deep-space sci-fi film and the sleepless minimalism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>.</p>
<p>That kind of vast sound makes <i>Soundtracks </i>one of Beatty’s most widescreen works, but it’s also–paradoxically, perhaps–relatively limited in its potential appeal. Where Three Legged Race often offers hooks here and there to latch onto, <i>Soundtracks</i> is more suited for listeners inclined toward abstraction. But as an indication of how limitless Beatty’s palate is–and how much further he could take his music–<i>Soundtracks for Takeshi Murata </i>is as valuable as anything he’s done.</p></div>"|18742.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18742-robert-beatty-soundtracks-for-takeshi-murata/|6.9|Marc Masters

Whether working in music, painting, or poetry, perhaps you can only effectively leave out as much as you've previously put in. Norwegian house music producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5368-bjorn-torske/"">Bjørn Torske</a> has been at it since the late 1990s, and it shows in his advanced level of idiosyncratic understatement. He builds enveloping, vividly fluttering shapes from the merest scraps of musical information—a plucked string, a smear of organ, a dollop of bass—which are deeply syncopated around contoured absences, where the more overt gestures of house music should be. Torske's constructions sound at once impossible and effortless, as if lightly carried along by their own oddball physics, and he treats 4/4 time like a curio cabinet that hides infinite compartments of different shapes and sizes.  </p>
<p>In recent years, Torske has been making what are essentially loose disco edits of his own instrumental recordings. Organically shambling but mechanically repetitive, the style sounds more like deceptively simple psychedelic pop (Moondog is frequently invoked by way of comparison) than dance music. 2010's <i>Kokning</i> was soft and shaggy, with a warm acoustic glow, and seemed much more concerned with gently nudging around time and space than moving bodies. Some quirky programmed rhythms cast thin tethers to the dance floor, but even those fall away on the <i>Kok </i>EP, which was recorded during the same studio sessions as <i>Kokning</i>. You can certainly hear the tonal and instrumental continuity, with lots of ultra-minimal funk guitar slowed down to a canter and lush, sharply glinting organ tones<i>. Kok</i> winds up like a concise alternate version of <i>Kokning</i> mixed purely with headphones in mind.</p>
<p><i>Kok</i> seems at first like it might shape up as little more than <i>Kokning</i> outtakes, a pleasant if not exactly thrilling proposition. The opening prelude is a just brief cinema theme for walking bass, organ, chimes, and scatted claps. The following ""Assistenten"" has a nice taut build around an off-center pulse, expanding the established sound palette with slapping percussion and what sounds like a tiny elephant trumpeting. But Torske is still just warming up, and the final three pieces feel like more than practiced vamps. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16362-setter/"">""Setter""</a> braids together stuck string figures, shivery drones, and jittery percussion into one striated mass. On ""Totem Expose"", wowing frequencies bore urgent rhythms through a metallic noise cloud that gradually turns inside out, ending as an organist's hymn. And mesmerizing finale ""Nestor"" sends a filtered curlicue slowly arcing through a cold cosmos of rangy, oblique counterpoint. Though less fleshed-out and essential than <i>Kokning</i> or its predecessor, the delightful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10458-feil-knapp/""><i>Feil Knapp</i></a>, this final entry in Torske's ""to boil"" trilogy (counting last year's <i>Oppkok</i> remix 12"") has more than enough simmer to warrant the concept.</p></div>"|18790.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18790-bjorn-torske-kok-ep/|6.5|Brian Howe

<p><i>7 Days of Funk </i>makes it immediately clear that it doesn't. Far from ridiculous, it's actually the most natural thing in the world, work from two musicians who grew up on the same sounds and were born less than a year apart. Snoop, recording as “Snoopzilla” as a conscious homage to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=husf6po76mU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the influence of Bootsy Collins</a>, is in top laidback mode here, the self-assured smoothness that made him a star gliding along whether he's (serviceably) singing or (engagingly) rapping. D<span id=""docs-internal-guid-238105ee-be0e-2440-d163-fc1ecc41ea9b""><span>â</span></span>m-Funk's thing is revamping and renewing the classic synthesizer melodies, electronic basslines, and digital drums that coursed through funk both before and after they attached the “g-” to it, a triple-layered take on 80s electro-boogie, 90s West Coast hip-hop, and contemporary nu-funk that helps the music work on all these different levels. And with both artists' stated mission to do this project as a fuck-the-radio labor of love—home-recorded and assembled quickly, with a rush owing more to easy inspiration than stressful deadlines—the easygoing nature shines, even through the cuts that wax ambivalent about love or challenge rivals to step up.</p>
<p>The leadoff cut “Hit Da Pavement” pulls off this vibe from the word go, the titular refrain initially reading like a duck-down threat on paper but evoking that other meaning of hitting the pavement; Snoop's “you don't work, you don't eat” language acting as the prime motivator. He pulls off romantic appeals without sounding syrupy (“I'll Be There 4U”) and breakup ruminations without sounding antagonistic (“Faden Away”)—the kind of unflappable ease that still sounds satisfied with his vet-status years instead of bored by them. He's not Nate Dogg or anything, but his workmanlike singing voice is smooth enough to mesh with the piled-high space-flight chords D<span>â</span>m-Funk uses to buoy it. It's late-night party music that sounds equally calibrated for winding down or getting worked up, and D<span>â</span>m's typical propensity to let rhythms and riffs soak for a bit before taking off into solo turf keeps it moving.</p>
<p>It's a strong mode to be in, but <i>7 Days of Funk </i>doesn't change or challenge things—it's a brief LP, even accounting for bonus tracks, and with everybody firmly in a comfortable lane there's not much surprise. There's Steve Arrington again, following up <i>Higher </i>with an engagingly quirky spotlight turn on “1Question?” that makes Snoop sound like a guest on his own track. <i>Toeachizown </i>highlight “I Gots 2 Be Done Wit' U” repurposed and given a new squiggly outro solo for “Do My Thang”. And the smooth-rolling vibe is so seamless and immersive that even the slightest deviation from it sounds jarring—Kurupt's verse on “Ride” is perfunctory though not terrible, and yet over that backdrop he sounds so far out of the pocket you'd need a chain wallet to bring him back. This isn't the out-of-nowhere clash of strange bedfellows that some people might imagine from a “Snoop on Stones Throw?!” expectation—in fact, it feels practically inevitable. Without the element of surprise or clashing styles forced to compromise, though, all you've got is a solid record that does exactly what you'd hope it does, nothing you think it shouldn't, and not quite enough to make you feel like they've explored every idea they could.</p></div>"|18801.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18801-7-days-of-funk-7-days-of-funk/|7.0|Nate Patrin

These past 12 months did offer a fine new EP and an okay-enough album—their fourth since early 2012—from the reunited <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"" target=""_blank"">Guided by Voices</a>. But it's become increasingly clear that a classic on par with the lo-fi legends' peak-era material might've been a little too much to ask for. Then there was the late-summer tiff between Pollard and drummer Kevin Fennell, whose unsuccessful attempt to peddle the beaten-to-shit drumkit he'd recorded many GBV classics on got him publicly shamed and subsequently fired by his old pal Bob. Bursts of drama notwithstanding, shows were few and far between, and side-hustles have been scant and largely of little consequence. The lone bright spot came this summer, when Pollard issued the rich, graceful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18249-robert-pollard-honey-locust-honky-tonk/"" target=""_blank""><i>Honey Locust Honky Tonk</i></a>, instantly cementing itself as one of the best records under his own name. Now, Pollard's closing out this weird year with <i>Blazing Gentlemen</i>, a headier, rockier counterpoint to the unfailingly sweet <i>Honey Locust</i>.</p>
<p>For a guy who's made records every which way, the approach Pollard took with <i>Gentlemen</i>'s construction is especially peculiar. Instead of appliquéing words onto melodies, he built these songs from the lyrics up, scouring his notebooks line-by-line for titles and lyrics, then writing melodies—and then chords—around those. Pollard's always been a collagist—sometimes quite literally—but this method feels especially piecemeal; every few lines, the underriding melody seems to shift, leaving behind any sense of continuity. Much of Pollard's best work has taken a similarly attention-deficient tack, although <i>Gentlemen</i>'s disjointment is at the micro level, all mismatched segments and jarring transitions. And, given the wide range in quality between one segment to the next, your time with Gentlemen's spent waiting around for the good part, only to find it gone before you've been properly introduced.</p>
<p>Ramrodding through 16 songs in 32 minutes and change, <i>Gentlemen</i> may be the least classically pretty Pollard in ages; ballads are scant, distortion's applied liberally, and while the fidelity's fairly high and the instrumentation consistent, the collection—throwing <i>Honey Locust</i>'s carefully considered lushness in stark relief—opts for the quick and dirty. Pollard and <i>Gentlemen</i> cohort Todd Tobias—together, responsible for every sound you hear on the record—have certainly arranged a plaintive melody or two in their day, but <i>Gentlemen</i> largely leaves these overexcitable songs to their own devices. Opener ""Magic Man Hype"" is held together by sheer inertia, rumbling through chord after oddball chord. The title track matches a sludgy verse to a towering chorus, which would be fine, if an out-from-nowhere bridge didn't pop up to derail the forward motion. ""His passionless kisses are real hits and misses,"" Pollard sings on ""Blazing Gentlemen"", and that pretty much sums it up: song for song, Pollard records are typically a hodgepodge, but the eternally jumpy <i>Gentlemen</i> whittles that inconsistency down to a second-by-second basis.</p>
<p>Whenever Pollard can keep an idea in his head for more than a minute at a time, <i>Gentlemen</i> starts to click. The cowbell-imbued ""Faking the Boy Scouts"" sports the set's stickiest hook; sure, its verses are a tad on the jittery side, but unlike much of <i>Blazing Gentlemen</i>, they at least seem to be acquainted with the chorus that follows. ""Tea People"" is one of those effortlessly catchy, totally stupid stompers only Pollard can get away with, and again, its verse and chorus seem to have been in the same room before. But for every song that seems to have been conceived as a piece, there are two more assembled from whatever they had lying around. ""Tonight's the Rodeo"" is elegant enough at first, but its chorus—all three seconds of it—is given neither time nor space to develop itself as anything but a nuisance. The lyrics are just as scatterbrained as the music, notebook dumps turned not-so-exquisite corpses; Pollard-logic is never an easy path to follow, but <i>Gentlemen</i> gets your head spinning in a fashion that'll have you swearing off the stuff the next morning.</p>
<p>Are two half-formed ideas as good as one complete thought? <i>Gentlemen</i> seems to think so. But, for all of <i>Gentlemen</i>'s nervy shapeshifting, its fitful thrills never quite make for a satisfying whole; it's too restless, too scattered, too gangly. Even the record's more-consistent-than-usual sound can't help hold these spasmodic, shapeshifting songs together for more than a couple minutes at a time. Some fans will no doubt revel in <i>Gentlemen</i>'s endless discrepancies; after all, part of being a Pollard obsessive is learning to take the bad with the good. But, on <i>Gentlemen</i>, the bad and the good are so manically intertwined, it gets to be a little tough telling them apart. <i>Gentlemen</i>'s about as interesting as middling Pollard records get, but it's middling all the same, a fittingly abnormal end to a most unusual year.</p></div>"|18802.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18802-robert-pollard-blazing-gentlemen/|5.7|Paul Thompson

If there's a thread that links the label's eclectic past and present roster—including artists such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29994-julia-holter/"">Julia Holter</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28951-sun-araw/"">Sun Araw</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28910-stellar-om-source/"">Stellar Om Source</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30806-holly-herndon/"">Holly Herndon</a>—it's in the clarity of vision they all possess. When an RVNG album arrives, the music on it usually feels fully formed, even if it's part of a musician's earliest output. There's room for experimentation too, notably on the label's series of FRKWYS releases. Gardland are the Australian duo of Alex Murray and Mark Smith, who release electronic music by an array of artists on their own <a href=""http://hunter-gather.it/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hunter Gatherer</a> label. Here on <i>Syndrome Syndrome</i>, their debut album, there's a freeform feel that has more in common with the FRKWYS work than RVNG's regular releases.</p>
<p>Most Gardland tracks are open-ended, resembling fragments of ideas that could easily double or halve in length and not necessarily end up in a different space. <i>Syndrome Syndrome</i> offers a full set of immaculately sequenced instrumental works, most of which bear dark surface textures that glide over understated beats. This is techno as a head trip rather than something to dance to, although it's possible to trance out to the cheap acid burbles of ""Magicville"", or feel a surge of energy in the unexpected callback to the ""clonk"" sound of Sweet Exorcist's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOzWrJ6nPIo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Testone""</a> on ""One in None"". Essentially most of the material here is resolutely backward looking, recalling the downtempo bleeps and beats of IDM, all shaped by a duo who have a clear affection for those times.</p>
<p>""Nothing But Not Zero"" is the archetypal Gardland track. It begin with an abstract sound repeated and contorted over and over while a beat builds behind it, ultimately drifting into quieter terrain following a great pile-up of noisier elements. Only occasionally is there a real sense of purpose behind the music, with Murray and Smith seemingly just trying stuff out to see how it fits with their wide-open structures. With a runtime of over an hour (including bonus tracks) it makes <i>Syndrome Syndrome</i> a trying proposition at times, especially when the ideas start to circle around on themselves. On a track like the rippling ""Katarakt"" there's clearly some excellent editing at work, with each part expertly cut in place. It's too bad that kind of thinking didn't stretch to the overall album, which could have benefited hugely from the trimming of fat.</p>
<p>Part of the stated intent behind Hunter Gatherer is to embrace music with ""flaws and idiosyncrasies, chance and spontaneity."" <i>Syndrome Syndrome</i> more than meets those goals, although its brightest moment comes tucked away in the bonus cut ""Reak"", a relatively straightforward piece of slamming techno that dispenses with most of what came before and simply heads to the dancefloor. There's a stronger sense of design at work there, coupled with a feeling of joy that’s strangely absent elsewhere, considering how powerfully it emerges at the end of the album. It lends an imbalance to the record, adding to the feeling that <i>Syndrome Syndrome</i> is more a testing ground for ideas than a fully developed project, especially as Murray and Smith have only been making this music for a year. <i>Syndrome Syndrome</i> offers some rewards, but it may have been a fraction too soon for them to make their first move.</p></div>"|18648.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18648-gardland-syndrome-syndrome/|6.3|Nick Neyland

The Seattle black metal duo had been quiet for several years before its release; since then, though, they've thrown themselves into the business of being a full-time band. Their recent signing to major indie Season of Mist is a satisfying notch on the bedpost for vocalist/guitarist Dagon and drummer Incubus, who've reacted to their alliance with a “big label” by changing nothing whatsoever about their music or their approach towards occult exploration. Fans never expected them to react any differently, and the great wailing and gnashing of teeth that usually accompanies the announcement of a beloved underground band stumbling into the spotlight has been absent. After all, as even the webboard warriors seem to know, a new album is another opportunity for the band to stalk in and show everyone else how it’s done.</p>
<p><i>Obscure Verses for the Multiverse</i> picks up where its predecessor left off. As usual, Dagon’s guitar work blends seamlessly with Incubus’ drums, and they remain merrily bass-free. Like some bizarro-world version of (until recently) bassless grind savants Pig Destroyer, they’ve hit upon and perfected a formula that would leave a lesser band sounding flat and soulless. Inquisition built their reputation upon a small selection of ironclad riffs and dynamic devices—every note follows a predetermined script, one that they’ve had memorized for decades, and it works.</p>
<p>Consider “Darkness Flows Towards Unseen Horizons”. A characteristic down-tempo melody opens the song, which hurtles immediately into a relentless blast, then back again. The band’s fondness for a good mid-song tempo shift has become one of their calling cards, and an Inquisition tune bereft of its appearance feels a bit off-kilter. Groove-laden tracks like “Master of the Cosmological Black Cauldron” and “Inversion of Ethereal White Stars” are beefy head-nodders that feature some of Dagon’s best guitar work as he manipulates and torments his strings into all manner of eerie tones. Outside of his propensity for note-bending, it’s worth noting the man’s uncanny knack for molding a gloomy shred of melody into an improbable earworm. While there are no obvious “hits” like on <i>Ominous Doctinres</i>, the album is still about as catchy as a pure black metal record has any right to be. A triumphantly powerful melodic break forms the centerpiece of a “Spiritual Plasma Evocation”, a track that despite its lack of ravens or winterdemonry, emphatically gives legs to the Immortal comparisons that have dogged the band for years.</p>
<p>The songs’ carefully cultivated atmosphere and aim towards an organic-sounding production leaves plenty of room for Dagon’s esoteric tales of space, time, and the Devil to unfold. This album is focused even more heavily on the cosmic and the metaphysical than past efforts, and the lyrics are an absolute trip. As the title track goes, ""Only darkness in the skies/ When you came light was shined/ Wisdom from cosmic snakes of dimensions you create/ Spawning humans as a slave serving kings of astral thrones."" Here’s hoping you can understand them, though, since Dagon’s infamous vocals are in full display.</p>
<p>His froggy croak may sound like a direct descendent of Abbath’s own strangled ribbeting, but comes from a far more evil place; it’s the former’s effort to sound as inhuman and alien as possible to accompany their occult cosmic ceremonies. In truth, though they began life as a thrash band, Inquisition still predates Immortal by several years. While the two bands developed and released their first important works during the same time period, it’s worth noting that Dagon was already croaking up a storm before Abbath even donned the paint. It seems almost passé to make a reference to the Norwegian demons here, but the parallel between the two entities’ melodic make up (not to mention that voice) is undeniable.</p>
<p>As the story goes, Inquisition originally formed while Dagon was living in Colombia in 1989, predating the famed Second Wave’s most active period and ensuring that the band’s early days would be spent learning from greats like Reencarnación, Blasfemia, and Parabellum. They’ve been there since the beginning, and will be here making outstanding records long after the rest of their peers have given up the ghost. Dagon’s 1996 move to the United States only aided them in their mission, and now, it seems as though this cult favorite is finally beginning to reap the rewards of a lifetime of hard graft and black magic.</p></div>"|18620.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18620-inquisition-obscure-verses-for-the-multiverse/|8.1|Kim Kelly

(The track is song is called ""Paper Rock, Scissors,"" suggesting how they settled the issue.)  The two rappers—Starlito from Nashville, Don Trip from Memphis—enjoy a bond unusual among solo artists and particularly unique among rappers. (I recommend reading <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2013/10/23/interview-starlito-and-don-trip/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">some</a> <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2013/10/starlito-don-trip-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviews</a> with the two of them if you need to feel good today.) The two met in 2010, when they were both were fairly recent castoffs from major labels; Don Trip had a cup of coffee on Interscope, while Starlito submitted his talents to the ruthless Cash Money grinder for years. Both of them were in the throes of building the kind of midlevel regional careers that ensures you'll always have fans but might never have money. They clicked. </p>
<p><span>The mixtape they made, 2011's </span><i>Step Brothers</i><span>, took its title from the then-three-year-old Will Ferrell/John C. Reilly vehicle. ""[I was drawn to] the concept of the camaraderie between two strangers that were so quirky in their own regard that they wouldn't gel with anyone else,"" Starlito told <i>The Fader</i>. It was the most popular thing either of them had ever released; fair or not, they learned the world paid more attention to them together than to either of them alone.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Other rappers might have rushed out a sequel within six months, to strike while the iron is hot. But Lito and Trip are shrewd and deliberate, which means that <i>Step Brothers 2</i> is out now, two years later, and unlike its predecessor, it's available for retail. They spent money on beats from Drumma Boy, Sonny Digital, and other in-demand producers, and honed their songs and concepts. What you don't get this time around: the bottled-lightning sound of two rappers falling in love with each other's ideas in real time. What you do get: Two of the most honest writers in rap working together at maximum comfort and confidence.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As with the first <i>Step Brothers</i>, Lito and Trip largely don't bother with hooks. ""No chorus but it's goin' on like four minutes,"" Starlito says wryly on ""Paper, Rock Scissors,"" and many of these songs just go on and on, in the best and most exciting sense, both rappers dreaming up vivid phrasing and rapping for audiences of one. ""My ink pen drip icicles,"" Don Trip says on ""Paper, Rock, Scissors"". ""Servin, servin like we never heard of cops/ Prefer to handle my business personally -you want this work or not?"" raps Starlito on ""28th Song"". They elbow out the beats, blotting out the empty spaces, rap for 32 bars or more; they have too much to say, and it's exhilarating.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For the friendly-competition purposes of <i>Step Brothers 3</i>, I'll observe that Lito gets Trip on this one, just barely. Trip makes his way from point A to B by stringing sometimes-dumb puns together, as in ""Life is sweet, but still sucks, like a Sno Cone"" (""4x4 Relay""), while Lito raps in gorgeously accumulating run-on sentences, dotted with musical phrasings and internal rhymes. Following along with the long ""O"" sounds in a stretch of rhyme like ""On the low I been unfocused, I'm just hoping no one notices/ Trying to play my cards right, but things got wild as the Joker is/ The things I love I kill for, call my bluff with no poker chips/ got this chip on my shoulder which/ Brings me to this lick I'm about to hit"" (from ""Caesar and Brutus"") points you toward the subtlety of Lito's writing, which never halts the force of his rapping.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Starlito has had a quietly triumphant year; <i>Step Brothers</i> 2 is his <i>third</i> stellar full-length of 2013. His musing, wry style has gathered resonance as he's developed as an artist, and this year, every off-the-cuff thought he shared cut to the bone. On <i>Funerals &amp; Court Dates</i> from last winter, he talked ruefully about not finishing college, simply because ""shit's expensive."" On <i>Cold Turkey</i> from this summer, he told us to call our grandmother to ""see how her day went. ""This advice come with experience, you ain't gotta take it,"" he shrugged.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> It's this unforced honesty he shares with Don Trip, whose biggest song, ""Letter To My Son"", was a powerful lament about struggling to visit his child that lingered over details like court-appointed visitation rights. His adlib is a high-pitched, braying cackle, the sound of someone's soused uncle laughing at his own off-color joke; he's a good foil for the subdued Starlito, who can get lost in his own mind occasionally. <i>Step Brothers 2</i> was financed by the tour that the two rappers booked themselves, without a team of promoters. Hopefully, it will inch the career of both rappers a little further up the ladder.They deserve a dedicated cult fanbase in every major American city.</span></p></div>"|18803.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18803-don-trip-starlito-step-brothers-2/|7.7|Jayson Greene

Captured at a February 2012 gig in London, <i>Brixton</i> finds the Georgia prog-sludge mainstays barreling through 23 choice cuts from their five good-to-classic LPs, 2002's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5142-remission/"" target=""_blank""><i>Remission</i></a> through 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15880-the-hunter/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Hunter</i></a>, a typically remarkable performance from a band whose live prowess rivals their in-studio wizardry. Like most overviews, the song selection's arguable, the impact of even the highest highs altered in their uprooting. But <i>Brixton</i> does the same rep-cementing, catalog-calcifying work a good hits comp is supposed to, further solidifying Mastodon's spot among the greatest big-ticket metal bands going.</p>
<p>Some bands make records; from the start, Mastodon have been turning out capital-A albums. From <i>Leviathan</i>'s seafaring to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12872-crack-the-skye/"" target=""_blank""><i>Crack the Skye</i></a>'s out-of-body postmortems, they're three for five on concept LPs; even their 2002 debut <i>Remission</i> hinges loosely around that most classically metal of the Aristotelian elements, fire. <i>Skye</i>, with its overlong runtimes and a particularly convoluted concept, sagged a little under the weight of its own pretensions: no easy feat for a band whose best album gave a close read to a 19th century novel about whaling. The Mike Elizondo-produced <i>Hunter</i> was a hard swing in the the other direction: reeling in the complexities of their previous work, <i>Hunter</i> felt concise yet rudderless, occasionally slick to the point of sterility. <i>Brixton</i>, understandably, is heavy on the then-new <i>Hunter</i> material. But onstage, stripped of Elizondo's radio-ready production and slotted in amidst the burlier stuff from their earlier classics, it feels redeemed, finding a heft and grit they couldn't quite locate in the studio.</p>
<p>I first saw Mastodon in early 2004, warming up for Clutch at some shithole club several months before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5143-leviathan/"" target=""_blank""><i>Leviathan</i></a>'s release. Even then, they seemed 15 feet tall. The show at the 4,000 capacity Brixton was, at the time, their largest-ever headlining gig. They make the most of it, tearing through 97 mostly uninterrupted minutes for a ravenous crowd. Live and on record, Mastodon's strength lies in playing the angles; they're progressive but accessible, hard to pin down yet instantly recognizable, hooky without sacrificing aggression, ""literary"" without getting too nerdy with it; I'm told Troy Sanders is <a href=""http://blastbeat.us/?p=3768"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">easy on the eyes</a>. Onstage, they aren't the kind of band to blow shit up, or waste any time with banter; at <i>Brixton</i>, they perform with minimal (albeit effective) lighting in front of a large <i>Hunter</i> banner, and only speak to the crowd as the encore-capping ""Creature Lives"" winds down. These songs—particularly the pre-<i>Hunter</i> numbers—are performed with mystifying precision, holding close to their recorded counterparts; a particularly fiery solo from Brent Hinds leads ""Circle of Cysquatch"" into ""Aqua Dementia"", and he sneaks some bonus guitar harmonics on ""Sleeping Giant"", but where extras are concerned, that's about it. Still, just seeing these knotty songs through an hour and half of entanglements is more than enough with got several thousand watts—and the screams of 4,000 devotees—helping them. The video portion of <i>Brixton</i> spends a not-inconsiderable amount of time behind Brann Dailor, and with good reason; in a band with no shortage of virtuosos, the lithe, batteramming Dailor's the best of the bunch, and he seems to get a good hour into <i>Brixton</i> without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>There's not much point in rehashing the finer points of the songs from <i>Leviathan</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9426-blood-mountain/"" target=""_blank""><i>Blood Mountain</i></a>, Mastodon's take-your-pick classics, both generously represented here; suffice it to say, even after dozens upons dozens of listens, their technical prowess and continued unpredictability still astonish. The <i>Remission</i> material—""Where Strides the Behemoth"" and ""March of the Fire Ants""—feels particularly fierce, a grinding, thrashing, death metal-imbued ruckus fine-tuned on their early singles and all but perfected on that first LP. They pare down <i>Skye</i> to just ""Ghost of Karelia"" and its title track, mercifully leaving the 10+ minute slogs and the why-would-you-do-that banjo of ""Divinations"" for another night.</p>
<p>Again, though, it's <i>Hunter</i> that benefits the most in <i>Brixton</i>. Those songs—rife with classic-rock affectations, finely tuned harmonies, and uncharacteristically pristine production—felt compromised on record. Onstage, they're brought surging to life; the tempos seem turned up a few notches, the production tics are largely lost to the full-on assault, and Hinds and Sanders lend the vocals a gruffness more in line with their earlier work. <i>Hunter</i> detractors (and I count myself among this group) would be right to expect a dip in energy and/or quality when those songs start up, but that's only slightly true; the newer songs help play up the Georgia roots in the older material, while the pre-<i>Hunter</i> wildness ramps up a forward motion even ""Bedazzled Fingernails"" can't seem to scratch.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Brixton</i>'s still dogged by a few of the issues plaguing almost every live album. Turns out, 97 minutes is a hell of a lot of Mastodon, and since they're not exactly the most demonstrative band, getting through the whole thing in a single sitting's not easy without running to the fridge for another beer. Flattering as these performances are to <i>The Hunter</i>, after a few spins of <i>Brixton</i>, the next time you've got an hour and a half to spend on sludge, you're more than likely going to return to that familiar <i>Leviathan</i>/<i>Blood Mountain</i> twofer. But, as a celebration of Mastodon's impressive catalog and incredible live prowess, Brixton can afford to be a little overgenerous. They've been one of metal's sharpest, flat-out exciting bands for more than a decade now, and <i>Brixton</i> plays to their strengths while bowling over any minor missteps from their recent LPs. <i>Brixton</i> ends with the Dailor-sung lighter-flicker ""Creature Lives"", arguably the weakest of <i>The Hunter</i>'s weak spots. A few seconds in, the band are joined by then-tourmates Red Fang and the Dillinger Escape Plan, helping lead the crowd in a massive singalong. It's a real brothers-in-arms moment, exactly the way the song—oddly out of place on record—was meant to be heard. It's a triumphant moment, the last of many on <i>Brixton</i>.</p></div>"|18800.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18800-mastodon-live-in-brixton/|7.6|Paul Thompson

It proved to be a schtick they continued to milk into the present, be it in cinema, on-stage in a pyramid or on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories/"" target=""_blank""><i>Random Access Memories</i></a>, but the robotic novelty was only evocative stateside. Had one come of age in Europe during the 1970s, one could have come across any number of musical acts on television not named Kraftwerk perpetuating their man-machine sides, either <a href=""http://youtu.be/nokkQj8E2ZY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dressed in space suits</a>, <a href=""http://youtu.be/FvO39SPwbdk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">with painted silver faces</a>, <a href=""http://youtu.be/MzDsPRSRC3s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">or perhaps with silver faces and chain mail spacesuits</a>.</p>
<p>This curious decade, wherein progressive rock musicians and studio whizzes obtained futuristic synthesizers and otherworldly effects to imagine new cosmic vistas (<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2013/nov/14/giorgio-moroder-i-feel-love-video-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">or else they just went and checked out <i>Star Wars</i> at their local Cineplex and saw the future of music</a>), gets documented on the new compilation <i>Cosmic Machine: A Voyage Across French Cosmic &amp; Electronic Avantgarde (1970-1980)</i>. Within this set’s shiny silver carapace lie the roots of acts ranging from Daft Punk and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2223-justice/"" target=""_blank"">Justice</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14576-todd-terje/"" target=""_blank"">Todd Terje</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2619-lindstrom/"" target=""_blank"">Lindstrøm</a> and any number of analog synth enthusiasts working on 21st century electronic music.</p>
<p>At its most interesting, <i>Cosmic Machine</i> shows the mercenary-like tendencies of these European musicians, changing from tweed to chiffon to tinfoil as the trends occurred. The warbling soft focus synths that open the set come from Patrick Juvet, a Swiss pop vocalist who finally achieved chart success only when he began copping space disco moves later in the decade. Same goes for composer Didier Marouani, who dabbled in French chanson and pop balladry before adding starbursts, analog squelches and melancholic vocoders to 1979’s “Temps X"".</p>
<p>Which isn’t to suggest that everyone represented here was just cashing in. Prolific soundtrack composers like François De Roubaix, Alain Goraguer and Jean-Jacques Perrey kept abreast of such trends and technology, folding these extraterrestrial tones expertly into their works. One of the set’s surprises comes from Serge Gainsbourg—always known to push both envelopes and buttons—contributing an anxious slice of instrumental synth pop that brings to mind the throb of early Suicide as much as it does New Romanticism.</p>
<p>Some of the sounds here are glorious, fusty <i>fromage</i>, for synth aficionados and few others, as on tracks such as the Rockets’ “Rocket Man” and Pierre Bachelet’s “Motel Show"". But where the set excels is in showing how the booming percussion of progressive rock would soon become breaks fodder, be it in the huge kicks of Jean-Michel Jarre’s “Blackbird” and Cerrone’s tom-delirious “Générique (Début)"". In hindsight, the arrival of disco’s 4/4 backbeat tightened up almost every experimental synth noodle on here, making a star out of the likes of the aforementioned Cerrone and turning Space’s arpeggio-heavy “Magic Fly” into a NYC club staple for years.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p>Another name for the set could have easily been “The Roots of Daft Punk” as the duo’s sense of play comes through in almost every one of the set’s twenty tracks. One track entitled “Aqua”—featuring synths as airy as popcorn, ludicrous vocodered vocals and perky live drums—in particular seems to presage Daft Punk’s own muse. Credited to DVWB, it turns out to be the handiwork of Daniel Vangarde, a famous French session musician/arranger/ producer responsible for an innumerable amount of French music from the 1970s and 80s. But of course, he’s best known for being the father of Thomas Bangalter.</p></div>"|18782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18782-cosmic-machine-a-voyage-across-french-cosmic-electronic-avantgarde-1970-1980/|7.6|Andy Beta

Is it a body of water? Or, does it encompass Taking Back Sunday, Straylight Run, Brand New and perhaps Glassjaw? After </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4261-bleed-american/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bleed American </i></a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">broke emo onto alternative rock formats in the early 2000s, the aforementioned Islanders (and assorted New Jerseyans) took things to a colder, edgier place on the East Coast: more rooted in punk, but with slicker, sharper production, more verbose and venomous. And at least in their earliest incarnations, these acts had an discomforting tendency to invert the previously accepted gender dynamic, using their lyrics to make preemptive strikes rather than penning postmortems of heartbreak. So the above will probably do a lot to frame your opinion of <a href=""http://www.ironchic.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Iron Chic</a>, because the Huntington Station quintet aren’t hiding their lineage—they recently opened for Garden State spiritual brethren Saves the Day and their second LP (and first on punk stronghold Bridge Nine) </span><i>The Constant One </i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">is filled with bracing, explosive hooks, unresolved sexual and spiritual tension and very meaningful “whoa”s. But it fortunately lacks any accusatory overtone, and welcomes far more people than it initially lets on: underneath the pop-punk veneer is one of the most flat-out fun indie rock guitar records of recent vintage.</span></p>
<p>This isn’t complicated stuff, burly, beery and well-meaning like Iron Chic themselves even when they’re worrying themselves into a state of hypnosis (“Wolf Dix Rd""). Their reference points are not esoteric: the dashboard-pounding opener is titled “Bogus Journey”, a Game Boy chiptune rendering of “Spooky Action at a Distance” serves as its own intro and the most meta moment involves “Hey Jealousy” karaoke. And though I’ve only heard things about what an Iron Chic show is like, I’ve still<i> heard things</i>: dudes in flannels not so much singing along with Iron Chic as singing back <i>at them</i>, with much gesticulating, finger-pointing, fist-pumping and so forth. These are the stories you hear a lot these days as community-galvanizing pop-punk and emo are getting more attention, and typically, you need a preface on the band’s roots and ideals to get the full picture of why kids lose their shit. <i>The Constant One</i> is a rare time where you can say “it leaves nothing to the imagination” as a compliment. Or, to frame it another way, Iron Chic are holding nothing back and do their damnedest to make you feel less alone if you happen to be in the parts of the country they haven’t reached yet.</p>
<p><i>The Constant One</i> unwittingly serves as its own listening guide: Jason Lubrano‘s vocals are often doubled or tripled, if not group-hugged by the 15-deep “Iron Chic Solid Gold Singers.” Even solo, there’s a throat-straining grit and grain that still makes it sound like he’s ad-libbing over himself. Either way, you’ve learned how a group chant of Iron Chic lyrics sounds like, so go ahead and shout along in your car or your cubicle. Because they’re fun as hell anyway—“I don’t...I don’t fucking know!” “You had a heart of gold/ I know because I fucking sold it!” “get high/ say ‘fuck the world’ when we’re done with that!” “I can’t feel a fucking thing!” The lack of a Parental Advisory sticker should be inexplicable, except for the fact that <i>The Constant One</i> spends 40 minutes recalling the exact opposite of parental advisory; I’m pretty sure the first time your folks let you fend for yourself over a weekend, you heard the pick slide on “Bogus Journey” the moment their car left the driveway.</p>
<p>Quite often, “pop-punk” gets used to describe something that’s actually indie rock (see: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30624-swearin"">Swearin’</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids/"">Japandroids</a>), which can trigger a lot of negative biases amongst people who are fairly certain they’re not into the former. The difference lies in tone: pop-punk evokes palm-muted power chords with clean distortion and nasal vocals, whereas indie rock is most associated with shambling, jangly and fuzzy guitars with drawling vocals. Iron Chic gives you <i>both</i>. At their core, each of <i>The Constant One</i>’s ten proper tracks builds on revved-up progressions of three or four chords, spaced out for broad melodies and strummed almost exclusively in air-guitar accommodating 16th notes. During the relative jams of “Spooky Action at a Distance”, “Bogus Journey” and “Wolf Dix Rd.”, you get <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"" target=""_blank"">J. Mascis</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill/"" target=""_blank"">Doug Martsch</a> leads shaved and bathed—they’re not quite riffs, not quite solos and they can melodically support the song for minutes at a time. Though it’s sonically aligned with the likes of axe-wielding party/shit-starters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31392-diarrhea-planet"">Diarrhea Planet</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31229-so-so-glos/"">So So Glos</a>, Iron Chic are more sincere than snotty, thus their closest analogue is probably Japandroids—while I sorta hope they tour together at some point, I also worry about some sort of class action suit from ticketbuyers who whoa’d themselves into weeklong hangovers.</p>
<p>Because while <i>The Constant One</i> is metric tons of fun, it’s kinda the same variety of fun throughout. Even on the most puritanical melodic pop-punk/emo records of this sort, you’ll get a token ballad, your <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eE-SnlkE3M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Freakish”</a>, your <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_NHy7LRsFw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“New American Classic""</a>, your <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pQo9OQlIB8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Hear You Me”</a>, your <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spy-zkWHO4Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“The Devil In My Bloodstream” </a>and it’ll probably be the sixth song. Perhaps the first minute of “A Serious House on Serious Earth” counts, but the outliers on <i>The Constant One</i> are actually <i>faster</i> than what surrounds them. The constancy can make things a little blurry towards the end, and without the spoken word samples and goofy titles, it’d be tough to remember which song went was about the end of the world and which one was about the Gin Blossoms (that would be “True Miserable Experience”). Which makes a lot of sense for a record that all but affixes a foam dome to your head, so it's a same quibble. Look, it ain’t gonna change your life. Not by itself.  It just serves as a potential soundtrack for a night that you’ll remember for the rest of your life if you can remember it the next day.</p></div>"|18737.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18737-iron-chic-the-constant-one/|7.9|Ian Cohen

But “cinematic” has become such a cliché that lately I’ve tried to block images out of my head when I listen to wordless music, in hopes that I’ll absorb and think about the sounds on their own–or at least not call them “cinematic”. I keep trying to do that with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28308-noveller/"" target=""_blank"">Noveller</a>’s <i>No Dreams, </i>and I keep failing.</p>
<p>I doubt that Sarah Lipstate, who records as Noveller, would have a problem with that, nor would she object to <i>No Dreams </i>being described as “cinematic.” She’s been working with film about as long as she’s been a musician, and lately she’s ramped up that side of her art significantly, crafting soundtracks for feature films and performing live scores on <a href=""http://www.radiolab.org/live"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Radiolab</i>’s tour</a>. So she must have had some moving images in mind when she created the evocative, picture-worthy sounds on <i>No Dreams</i>.</p>
<p>What makes <i>No Dreams </i>more than just “cinematic” is the way Lipstate straddles the line between literal and abstract. Her sounds drift from moments that conjure vivid mental movies to something more amorphous and undefined—more visceral than visual. According to <a href=""http://importantrecords.com/imprec/imprec389"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">press materials</a> for <i>No Dreams, </i>these songs explore “blurred perception of reality and hallucination in the twilight of sleep and awakening.” The result is intoxicatingly hazy music, more fit for a half-remembered nightmare than a movie, with images flickering in and out of focus inside Lipstate’s shadowy soundscape.</p>
<p>Previously, Lipstate built her soundscapes just with guitar and effects, but this time she’s added synth, beats, and other instrumental elements. Perhaps that’s why her music sounds a little denser and darker now, but really, those added elements are more accents than features. Guitar is still the only star of her show, and on <i>No Dreams</i>’ best tracks it becomes a kind of God around which other sounds congregate. On tracks such as the harrowing “Mannahatta” and the mournful “Gathering the Elements,” Lipstate coaxes high, celestial tones from her strings, at times making them sound like a kind of interplanetary bagpipe. That move becomes a motif, as many tracks crest whenever she ascends into trebly drone. It doesn’t quite create the narrative thrust that the last Noveller album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15620-glacial-glow/"">Glacial Glow</a>, </i>possessed. But it ties album into a focused, cohesive sonic whole.</p>
<p>That brings up another cliché that I’m tempted to use to describe <i>No Dreams</i>. It’s as much atmospheric as it is cinematic, as much an environment to get lost in as a soundtrack to imagine pictures to. At this point “atmospheric” is an even more hackneyed descriptor than “cinematic,” but sometimes clichés are right. Sarah Lipstate creates miniature musical worlds, places that you feel like you’ll never leave long as the record is playing. Maybe her continually-strong work as Noveller can give some clichés a good name again. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p></div>"|18746.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18746-noveller-no-dreams/|7.2|Marc Masters

There are imprecations hurled in both English and Spanish and floods of sound so caustic and strong they rattle both brain and core. But the real shock of <i>Within the Walls</i>, the group’s first LP in seven years, comes at the start of the final track. Through a layer of squall and around the calm narration of Bloodyminded leader Mark Solotroff, a gently eerie keyboard line arrives like a glowing ghost. It’s only a few lurid notes, set to repeat and distend slowly into a blur. It’s also one of the most reserved and beautiful sounds in Bloodyminded’s two decades as a group—a sudden, surprising melody surrounded on all sides by madness. Played by heavy metal producer Sanford Parker, the little synthesizer theme eventually gives into Bloodyminded’s power electronics din, battling the squall in both volume and insistence. But make no mistake: It's a successful attempt from long-running noise veterans to use a new trick. It works.</p>
<p>The coda is actually a cover of “Inverted Ruins”, a Locrian number under which Solotroff hissed the same words on that group’s great 2010 album, <i>Territories</i>. The Bloodyminded reworking is faithful enough, using the same slow crawl toward chaos but promoting his vocals to the position of overlord. The choice to include the cover is an apt one; in the past few years, harsh electronic music has wormed its way closer toward indie rock’s core, thanks to the likes of Prurient, Pharmakon, Wolf Eyes, and, in some capacity, Locrian, too. “Inverted Ruins”, then, makes the precursor position of Solotroff and Bloodyminded clear. They are pioneers to a scene that has sprawled. Indirectly, it also reinforces the group’s fiercely prolific nature, no matter how slow the group’s proper output or live appearances have become. Member Pieter Schoolwerth helms Wierd Records, for instance, while Solotroff and his fellow vocalist Isidro Reyes have pumped out more than a dozen volumes in less than seven years under the name Fortieth Day. Bloodyminded itself has slowed, but its members have necessarily not.</p>
<p>What’s more, the time between <i>Within the Walls</i> and 2006’s <i>Magnetism</i> has only seemed to condense the band’s strengths, as these 13 songs consolidate what’s often been best and most intriguing about Bloodyminded’s output. For instance, <i>Gift Givers</i>, from 2005,<i> </i>pitted Solotroff’s clipped English phrases against the French lyrics of Xavier Laradji. <i>Within the Walls</i> instead works with Solotroff’s words and the Spanish lyrics of Reyes, who often hurls them out beneath the dominant tongue. Two scripts in two different languages might sound disorienting, but this multilingual approach actually makes <i>Within the Walls</i> a truly multivalent listen, the sort of thing you’ll want to hear again and again in order to tease out the nuances of what they’ve made. How do Solotroff and Reyes’ interconnected lyrics relate, and how do they work against the shifts around them? During “Fatal Breath”, for instance, Solotroff seethes about the inevitability of destruction, about systems that fall apart simply by existing; meanwhile, Reyes lurks beneath him and then occasionally jumps in front, retrenching the invective with his own views on corruption, oblivion, and unavoidable anguish. The sound is a nightmare. They complement and contradict one another throughout the record, constantly reinforcing the music’s tumult.</p>
<p><i>Within the Walls</i> alternates between long, ponderous poems shouted into or against the noise vortex and five ruthless bursts of pugilistic feedback and static lasting between nine and 68 seconds each. Bloodyminded has often used this see-saw technique in the past, onstage and offstage, but here it’s more deliberate and careful, meant to break up the verbose musings as much as it to show the group’s sonic willpower. More than anything, however, the ebb and flow appropriately spotlights the depth of Bloodyminded, a group whose very power and antagonistic nature <i>could</i> make their records monolithic and paradoxically sedate. But once again, they’ve found new ways to shock and enthrall, even if that requires a vivid recollection and recombination of the past.</p></div>"|18744.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18744-bloodyminded-within-the-walls/|7.5|Grayson Currin

<p>Unsurprisingly, it’s a third, less fantastical option—it’s Conor Oberst, Maria Taylor and friends (Andy LeMaster, Mike Mogis, Jake Bellows, Blake Sennett, et al.) doing fairly straightforward versions of both public domain and contemporary Christmas songs. But it’s still <i>something</i>. It’s a sensible project in retrospect, after all, many noted how <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10095-cassadaga/"">Cassadaga</a></i> single “Four Winds” sounded a hell of a lot like “Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"". The latter chestnut isn’t included so as to make the connection easier, though “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen” is given a minor-key, stomp-folk treatment that would’ve fit quite nicely on that LP. And look, this can’t possibly be a review of the source material. What could you possibly say? “Yeah, ‘Silent Night’ could really use a middle eight,"" “‘Away in a Manger’ is second tier Yule-wave”, “‘Blue Christmas’ is some navel-gazing, ‘woe is me’ bullshit”? It’s not even a question about whether Oberst, Taylor or anyone else involved here can do anything <i>new</i> with these songs. Can <i>A Christmas Album</i> give us an idea of what the holiday season means to them?</p>
<p>Based on that metric, <i>A Christmas Album</i> is about as effective and enjoyable as something like this can be. I’ve never been to Omaha. The vast majority of Bright Eyes’ output prior to <i>Lifted</i> (and really that of Saddle Creek) made this fact irrelevant, as Oberst and producer Mike Mogis always managed to allow their surroundings to infiltrate the music in a palpable way. And my guess is that the biggest city in Nebraska is just an extrapolated version of where many of us grew up and experienced the holiday season during our formative years. As Adam Duritz once put it, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjtbH0rOlRU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“somewhere in Middle America”</a>, a largescale suburb without much internal culture, where gentrification meant chain stores, T.G.I. Friday’s and indistinguishable housing plots.</p>
<p>More germane to <i>A Christmas Album</i>, as with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16532-bright-eyes-fevers-mirrors-there-is-no-beginning-to-the-story-ep/"">Fevers and Mirrors</a></i>, it captures the experience of being in Omaha on account of its performers sounding like they’re very, <i>very</i> cold. Beyond Oberst’s shivering vocal affectations, Bright Eyes songs occur in stuffy, artificially heated apartments, parents’ houses or the dark, empty expanses of corn fields at night. It’s no different here, as <i>A Christmas Album</i> often sounds like a field recording from chilly church basements or the dark, flat expanses of the Midwestern plains, barren, frozen, howling winds in the distance and the occasional flicker of light coming from Christmas decorations. <i>A Christmas Album</i> is composed of respectful, spare arrangements dotted by theremin-like effects, the clatter of found sound, choruses sung by huddled masses. It’s the warm feelings of the “season” mixed with the remembrance of freezing your ass off during winter.</p>
<p><i>A Christmas Album</i> is a thoughtful record beyond the mere production. The relatively contemporary “Blue Christmas” gives the original’s tale of unrequited love a properly Oberst-ian performance, Elvis’ croon traded for a stagy, sniveling sneer. It now sounds like a typical Bright Eyes song and of course, it was included on the “Chrismukkah” episode of ""The O.C.""  You can absolutely get this stuff wrong too and the only real dud on <i>A Christmas Album</i> is “Little Drummer Boy"". It’s a song that lends itself to reinterpretation—the onamatopoeiaic hook, the imagery, the imprint of seeing it performed by <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiXjbI3kRus"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bing Crosby and David Bowie</a>, whose unnerved glazed expression renders “white Christmas” a double entendre. But here, both Oberst and Taylor’s vocals are turned into black ice, piles of dirty, distorted slush battered by broken, erratic breakbeats. In other words, “Little Drummer Boy” got used as a test run for Bright Eyes’ 2005 album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11683-im-wide-awake-its-morning-digital-ash-in-a-digital-urn/"">Digital Ash in a Digital Urn</a></i> and as it turns out, that sort of mode is far more amenable to Oberst’s drug-fueled paranoia.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-60dac6f4-a5b3-18bf-2abc-b3b95188f1e6""><span>Maybe it’s just the timing, but </span><i>A Christmas Album </i><span>feels more attuned to the commonly, if dubiously, coined “Friendsgiving"", i.e., where people in their early 20s can’t get home for the holidays and serve as each other’s family, putting together a loving, low-stakes version of an affair that mostly finds everyone fraught and freaking out.

And </span><i>A Christmas Album </i><span>is something that can be considered on its own terms outside of the diehards it might appeal towards. If you somehow like everything about early Bright Eyes’ music except for the lyrics, it’ll be your favorite record of theirs. If, more likely, you’re a hardcore fan that was somehow unaware of its existence or didn’t shell out for the 180g white vinyl in 2009, it equally balances Yuletide memories with nostalgia for a time when Saddle Creek’s roster was still operating as a vibrant, and prolific artistic community. </span></span></p></div>"|18787.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18787-bright-eyes-a-christmas-album/|7.0|Ian Cohen

That has been the implicit mission in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/730-rhys-chatham/"" target=""_blank"">Rhys Chatham</a>'s music ever since he introduced <i>Guitar Trio</i> to the world in the late 1970s. The reaction many people have to hearing Chatham for the first time is some variant on ""I didn't know this existed."" ""This"" being an idea about the uniting power of pure sound, and the way it leaps over low borders set to contain it. Sounds, when they are powerful enough, rip through flimsy fabric, and how we feel about them, the arguments and justifications and rules we invent in their wake, are mere spasms, just a post-mortem.</p>
<p>Such are the lofty thoughts, anyway, you might find yourself encouraged to entertain while listening to one of his oceanic guitar works, often set for mighty, taking-of-Helm's-Deep-style  forces—100 guitarists! 400! His <i>Guitar Trio</i> is so iconic it's become a traveling revue of sorts, lighting up audiences of faithful everywhere it goes. The piece is so schematically simple Chatham can teach it to a new group, he claims, in a few minutes. But it generates layered, immense feelings of peace, contentment, exhilaration, conjuring the primal sensation of the first moment anyone ever plugged in an electric guitar and strummed, before any actual<i> learning to play</i> occurs. It represents some of the most transcendent and powerful work a single E chord has ever done. </p>
<p>Chatham's material scales upward into vista and back down into pinprick, depending on the work at hand. His latest release <i>Harmonie du Soir</i>, resides peacefully somewhere in the middle distance. The title work is set for an ensemble of six guitars and drums, his first such piece for this configuration since the mid-80s. The piece opens chiming on the root and fifth of an A chord, which is where it calmly stays, for eight minutes or longer. Marc Masters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18767-phill-niblock-nothin-to-look-at-just-a-record/"">wrote movingly</a>, earlier this week, about the curiously individual qualities of different kinds of drone, and he's right; there are <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13215-rated-o/"">drones that summon feelings of elemental horror and awe</a>, drones that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18425-bitchin-bajas-bitichitronics/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">feel like the wheeze of a timeshare air conditioner</a>. All of them have a quality that lures us toward them, a blank beam of light we can't help but stare into. Because it resides so firmly in the nonverbal realm of sound, it proves difficult to isolate, but allow me to try: Chatham's drone has a fluid sense of motion it, a dynamic sense. To use a metaphor from an earlier age of media, Chatham's guitar works have always sounded to me what the tape head cleaner might actually be playing if I just turned it up loud enough. Good drone music is body music; it just <i>feels</i> good. </p>
<p><i>Harmonie du Soir</i> eventually snaps into a second section—an E Chord, surrounded by drum fills, which eventually clarifies into a metronomic and deliberate riff. It sounds like the intro to a classic Television song that suddenly backed itself into a corner and became afraid to move. You might think about any number of things while the piece continues chiming in your headphones for the remaining 10 minutes—you might think about groceries that you need to pick up on the way home, or the third Pretenders studio album, or how certain ideas about music and sound never seem to lose their resonance, no matter how dated they might sound on paper.</p>
<p>The other two pieces on <i>Harmonie Du Soir</i> approach Chatham from different angles. <i>The Dream of Rhonabwy </i>is set for a 70-piece brass ensemble—minutes on end hang on nothing but brass drone, which, due to the vagaries of human breath, simply don't stay in tune. They move in and out of sour, beating semitones and waver back into unison, a drumbeat intruding occasionally onto the reverie. The piece swells, quietly, into some of the most harmonically sensual writing Chatham's done in awhile. And <i>Drastic Classicism Revisited</i> is exactly what it says it is—a screeching, clawing tear through a work that, along with <i>Guitar Trio</i>, more or less secures Chatham's legacy. The performance on this album, from 2012, has an anarchic propulsion, the drumming positively gleeful, near-sloppy at the edges. It is a primal wallow in how noise-rock feels, if not necessarily an example of noise rock as we know it. It is the uncooked stuff of rock music stretched out into infinity, what the best three seconds of every rock song you've ever loved felt like, and it hits a platonic spot in your mind. </p></div>"|18799.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18799-rhys-chatham-harmonie-du-soir/|7.5|Jayson Greene

Singer/songwriter Leanne Macomber also plays with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28027-neon-indian/"" target=""_blank"">Neon Indian</a>; multi-instrumentalist Joel Ford is one-half of production team <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29470-ford-lopatin/"" target=""_blank"">Fo</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29470-ford-lopatin/"" target=""_blank"">rd &amp; Lopatin</a>. Their debut album, <i>Dominae</i>, is stuffed with plenty of shiny, slinky sounds to score a neon-lit nightclub or a contemplative after-dusk drive. Making note of such an obviously appealing creative pedigree with a reflexively raised eye—they played their first concert during last month’s CMJ Marathon, by the way—wouldn’t be out of the question for listeners who’ve become deadened to the relentless cycle of new bands you've just got to hear. But Ejecta go beyond surface poise and artifice by building a complex world out of an imagined narrator’s deepest longings, imbuing an at-times generic sound with real emotional weight.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>At face value, <i>Dominae</i> mostly follows a template: Macomber’s voice is usually locked in at “breathy,” each song can usually be described as “synthpoppy,” and if you close your eyes, the whole thing might zip by as an amorphous lump of gliding synthesizers, electronic squiggles, and percussion bounces. But Ejecta is more than a name that sounds like it could’ve been yanked from any number of medium talent trip-hop acts from the 90s—it’s a character, one who Macomber has described as a release valve for her deepest impulses and someone who must always appear nude to further double down on that transparency. It makes sense when you focus on her lyrics, in which she admits feelings of shame, elation, lust, and despair. The exact scenario of what's got her twisted is sometimes vague, but the lack of descriptive detail</span> creates a distance befitting of powerful emotions reduced to their essence. (One might suggest that Macomber hardly needs to invent a character to project this kind of nakedly honest songwriting, but a sales pitch is a sales pitch.)</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Where the concept of Ejecta best manifests itself, though, is in Macomber and Ford’s wholehearted embrace of sounds that might scan as completely cheesy if paired with more banal sentiments. Two examples are the glistening introduction to “Mistress”, which sounds like an outtake Styx might’ve recorded on some beautifully coke-dusted summer night, or the sparkling disco of <span>“</span>Jeremiah<span>”</span>.  </span>If you’ve yet to be convinced of the spiritually purifying effect a synthesizer can have, this might not be the record to do it, but what the duo accomplish with a tonally consistent palette is at times astonishing. “It’s Only Love” navigates the complex balance of power and intent in any complicated relationship as Macomber finds the midpoint between coy and chilly over a crystalline instrumental. “Afraid of the Dark” opens on her voice as she solemnly narrates what sounds like a bittersweet breakup—again, the details are vague—and slowly builds momentum until you can imagine the band in blurred, beatific motion as she repeats a phrase that might function as Dominae’s thesis: “This warm heart's afraid of the dark/ Never gonna stop, I’m never going to conquer.”</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-54c89314-4e24-0fa4-5e32-c938804a5887""><span>Through the album, Macomber sings of love as an almost physical currency, something that’s taken or given with intentions that aren’t always on the level. There’s more to admitting your deepest desires and fears than just saying them out loud, of course, and the record’s most affecting moments are when it fully commits to its confessions—when you can believe that she, or Ejecta, is singing as truthfully as possible without drowning. It might take a moment to sink in, but it's there. </span></span></p></div>"|18739.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18739-ejecta-dominae/|7.0|Jeremy Gordon

Many comparisons were made between </span><i>GLAQJO XAACSSO </i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">and golden era Warp, and though patten’s reference points were mostly contemporary—up-to-date strains of hip-hop, house, and techno—he displayed a similar urge to push the parameters of these styles to the edge of chaos, perpetually striving for greater density, volume, abstraction. (He has also spoken about trying to work “in a subliminal state between waking and sleeping,” echoing </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Aphex Twin</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">’s notorious</span><i> </i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">sleep deprivation method). The resultant music was fascinating and often highly inventive. But it could sometimes feel like the sheer intensity of it all was concealing a basic paucity of material—that, as with those Wiki links, what we were dealing with was a diverting but rather shallow engagement with the subject matter at hand.  </span></div>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Perhaps it’s just that patten’s music doesn’t benefit from prolonged exposure. Certainly, condensed into 23 minutes on the <i>EOLIAN INSTATE </i>EP, the producer’s signature style<i> </i>is far more palatable. The tracks on this, his debut release for Warp, are a touch more incisive, although in other respects it seems that little has changed for patten in the past two years. The sound<i> </i>remains much the same—a pulverised form of electronica tempered with a subtle melodic glow—and passing comparisons can still be made to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28985-actress/"" target=""_blank"">Actress</a>’ heat-warped techno, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a> at his most fervidly psychedelic.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">In places the familiarity is welcome. Opener ""Aviary"" starts out near-impossibly dense and heads upwards from there, patten piling on ever more layers of gauzy texturing. ""Obsidian Alms (mid-saccade)"", a bracingly abstract take on warehouse techno, pushes this logic even further. But elsewhere it becomes clear that, in spite of its brevity, this is not an all-killer package. There’s pleasure<i> </i>to be found in the subtleties of ""Towards infinite shores"", but as a whole the thing feels rather desultory. And ""oea/Catalogue""'s steady accrual of material begins to feel workaday after about minute four, in spite of the peppy surface edits.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Fortunately, the loping ""Sixth seven"" shows that patten has a few new tricks up his sleeve. In this case it’s stripping things back. Given space to breathe, the vivid strangeness of each layer of material, and the way in which they fit together to form a single skewed mechanism, becomes all the clearer. Perhaps patten is learning, finally, that everything-all-the-time isn’t the only way to go<i>.</i></span> </p></div>"|18792.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18792-patten-eolian-instate-ep/|6.9|Angus Finlayson

<p dir=""ltr"">Fisher's greatest strength is his easy way with melody, and the rhythmically simple, luxe grooves that he carves out on <i>Non-Drowsy</i> are fine showcases for this talent. Simple, staccato basslines, reverberating vocal samples and gassy pads are neatly deployed and retracted. The album feels like classic dance music even when its direct antecedents are difficult to place. I think this might have been the point: to recreate and explore without ever getting too personal. The approach works best when Fisher chops up vocal samples into micro-melodies, as on ""Coffee"" or during the end of ""Huminbeen"". It's an approach that recalls both old-school sample scientists like Marc Kinchen as well as contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>. The haunted, tense piano chords that dominate ""Leonia"" and the queasy synths that oscillate in the background of ""4:21"" are excellent facsimiles. Nothing on <i>Non-Drowsy</i> sounds out of place.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This approach highlights one of the chief frustrations of listening to <i>Non-Drowsy</i>: it never feels explicitly retro <i>or</i> modern. It's a slippery album, one that's agreeable when it's on but fails to leave an impression. The tracks get no help from their mastering; <i>Non-Drowsy</i> is sonically mushy, its mids and highs bleeding into one another, its bass and drums failing to provide any real punch or grit; the arrangements glide by unmolested. This is a problem in part because the era and style of dance music that <i>Non-Drowsy</i> references was often expertly produced, its frequencies and arrangements optimized for maximum dancefloor impact. And while it's possible that this was done for effect—as a commentary on club music, or on the listeners who push it through plastic earbuds and muffled laptops—it doesn't aid the music (and your mileage on the validity of that theory will and should vary).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But <i>Non-Drowsy</i> isn't disappointing because it's not perfectly executed club music. It's disappointing because it's difficult to reconcile the creativity that Fisher displays in his videos, remixes, and (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/9013-the-worst-album-covers-of-2012/"" target=""_blank"">admittedly bad</a>) album artwork and the polite, uninteresting dance tracks on offer. Recognizing that Fisher has talent and maybe a unique voice is easy; finding that voice in <i>Non-Drowsy</i> is hard. Fisher remains a young artist—<i>Non-Drowsy</i> is just his second conventional release, and it's a free seven-track EP—so some growing pains are to be expected. Fisher has worked hard to present himself as a batshit urban cowboy with great taste and cool friends; the moment he starts sounding as such should produce some pretty interesting tracks, in whatever style has caught his fancy that day.</p></div>"|18781.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18781-physical-therapy-non-drowsy/|5.9|Andrew Gaerig

It's not hard to imagine him holed up in a studio into the wee hours, relentlessly tweaking the band's sound until he gets it just right. His group's desire to pull so many styles into their music calls for that level of detail<span>—</span>without it they'd be wading through a morass of overlapping genres with no central unified force to lean on. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31773-beedeegee/"">bEEdEEgEE</a> is DeGraw's solo guise, but it's not so different to his work elsewhere. <i>SUM/ONE</i>, his debut LP under this name, has an air of familiarity, with DeGraw's fondness for splicing up musical juxtapositions executed with the same feel of floaty optimism that pervades the most recent Gang Gang Dance records.</p>
<p>What's most surprising about this album is how little it strays from DeGraw's tried and tested formula. There are snatches of feel-good balearic house getting scuffed up by grime and trap-influenced beats, often layered over with the kind of sheer synth lines that surfaced often on 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15403-eye-contact/""><i>Eye Contact</i></a>. <i>SUM/ONE</i> feels very much a part of the Gang Gang eco-system instead of a branch away from it, ultimately resembling a natural extension of work undertaken in his day job instead of a chance to try out new ideas. If there is a difference it's in the lack of cohesion. The best Gang Gang Dance songs tend to find a point where ragged post-punk thinking can sit comfortably with hippy idealism. Here, on idea-packed tracks like ""Helium Anchor"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16161-bricks/"">""Bricks""</a>, the transitions are less fluid, the movement more blocky. There's a sense of ill-fitting pieces not quite finding the right space in which to come together.</p>
<p>Fortunately there are plenty of moments here when DeGraw eases up on the clutter, giving <i>SUM/ONE</i> an acre or two of room to stretch out into. ""Like Rain Man"" is the most successful collaborative track, perhaps because it's with his Gang Gang bandmate Lizzi Bougatsos, but also due to its slow-reveal nature. Elsewhere, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"">Hot Chip</a>'s Alexis Taylor has the effect of turning the sound a little too close to his own band, while a couple of attempts at working in a pure pop template fall flat. Even those ventures feel anchored in DeGraw's other world, with customary raindrop keyboard sounds stirred into the mix, coupled with a bout of genre hopping through a diverse, if slightly predictable, array of styles. It doesn't add much to what DeGraw has achieved elsewhere, but the overall feel is of a welcome gap-filler for anyone looking for a fix in between albums by his other band.</p>
<p>In a sense <i>SUM/ONE</i> suffers because of the higher standards DeGraw has already set. A track like ""Overlook"" is a decent halfway point between stuttering rhythms and sunshine pop, but it doesn't naturally sit with much else here until he loops back around to something resembling it with the closing ""Quantum Poet Riddim"". Gang Gang Dance records function as tight, intransigent worlds, but here there's too much fraying around the edges, too many loose ideas left to flap around in the breeze. It resembles a users guide to the building blocks DeGraw utilizes before he stitches his ideas together, almost feeling instructional in tone. This is a set of arrangements looking for a song, ultimately lacking the emotional dark/light contrast that DeGraw can usually divine from the source material he plunders. It's an intermittently thoughtful album, but one that doesn't stray far from offering process-laid-bare insight into the beautiful pile-up that is Gang Gang Dance.</p></div>"|18788.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18788-beedeegee-sumone/|6.8|Nick Neyland

Starlite’s pop is poised and unhurried, without being particularly flashy; vocally, thinking of a more soulful Peter Gabriel won’t take you far from the mark. And though the quality of his small catalogue has certainly lived up to, if not surpassed, his more well-known <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10761-oracular-spectacular/"">classmates</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10805-all-hour-cymbals/"">music</a>, its understated tone and the rather mysterious nature of its frontman kept Francis relatively off the radar. Though it’s been some time since Francis and the Lights delivered the promising 2010 debut <i>It’ll Be Better</i>—an album stocked with pop gems like “Knees to the Floor” that would have slayed in a different era but were hard to tack to a contemporary style—it’s a release that holds up because of that same timelessness. Save for some production work on Drake’s <i>Thank Me Later</i>—the slow-burn “Karaoke”—and the occasional high-concept <a href=""http://empac.rpi.edu/events/2011/fall/white-room"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">performance piece</a>, it’s been a quiet couple of years for the Lights.</p>
<p>Though Francis’ new EP <i>Like a Dream</i> is a brief outing—four songs that clock in, collectively, a few ticks shy of 14 minutes—it serves as  a satisfying end to the silence. Though nothing here approaches surefire radio smashes or really anything that’s going to hit you like a load of bricks, songs like collection-closer “ETC” and breezy opener “Like a Dream” hint at interesting new directions. The former feels like wading through a fog compared to Francis’ usual rather-direct approach, bouncing Starlite’s voice off itself to create one of the spacier, funkier atmospheres he's inhabited so far. Though something like “Like a Dream” is a breezy track whose complete lack of edge might rub you the wrong way—”This could be in a commercial!” a coworker brightly remarked—its gentle electric throb gets in your head.</p>
<p>The other songs on this collection, “If They Don’t Come Tomorrow” and “Betting on Us”, don’t exactly move the ball forward, but they aren’t necessarily worse off for their lack of inventiveness—they could easily be tacked onto the already-too-short <i>It’ll Be Better</i> and no one would blink. “Betting on Us” in particularly best channels that 80s-Gabriel-uplifting-pop thing that I can imagine most people will hear, which is to say that its bones are solid if not a touch generic. (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j379JbL-xM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You probably couldn’t blast it through a window, </a>unfortunately.) “If They Don’t Come Tomorrow” is another example of Francis treating his vocals more than his audience might be used to, but outside of a few nice vocal runs and a hook or two, it’s relatively aimless.</p>
<p>Though it’s dangerous to think of these pocket-sized releases as “appetizers,” <i>Like a Dream</i> is something that certainly primes the listener for the main course. Though it’s all relative when it comes to Francis’ tight, deliberate sound, the EP gives a glimpse of what <i>It’ll Be Better</i>’s follow-up might entail. Also, to be sure, <i>Like a Dream</i> also succeeds in re-injecting Francis into the conversation when the timing is a little better—though many soldiers have entered the borderlands of R&amp;B and singer-songwriter pop in recent years, it just might be that Francis is the most natural talent of all of them. (Just saying: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqhaMewA2K0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">He’s a memorable dancer</a>). But though nice moments speckle <i>Like a Dream</i>, it plays like a pleasant dream you can't quite recall.</p></div>"|18791.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18791-francis-and-the-lights-like-a-dream-ep/|7.0|Corban Goble

The Montreal singer/songwriter/producer arrived on the scene back in 2010 with his proper debut LP <i>Palinopsia</i>; the record's mix of swirling synths and emotive crooning captured a few zeitgeist points in North American underground music culture—the still-going integration of R&amp;B signifiers, the return of new age and kosmiche's starry-eyed tranquility, and a post-9/11 fixation on Eastern influences (in d'Eon's case, derived from his time spent in a Himalayan monastery). The following year saw a split release with perpetually of-the-moment fellow Canadian Grimes, <i>Darkbloom</i>, just as her star was on the impressive rise, while 2012's <i>LP</i> and his ongoing <i>Music for Keyboards</i> series found d'Eon pushing the new age triggers deep into the red. <i>Arc of Fire</i>, the debut EP from his new Kallisti project, is loaded with breakneck moments derived from 'ardkore and jungle's heyday—coincidentally, in a year where some of dance music's most accomplished producers have struck gold mining similar sounds.</p>
<p>A million miles away from the glistening, melismatic synth-pop of his previous releases, <i>Arc of Fire</i>, seemingly signals a 180 turn, creatively, for d'Eon. This isn't entirely true, though: d'Eon's FACT mix from last year, comprised almost entirely of new material, placed the high-BPM stuff amidst other, less intriguing genre-jacking attempts, presenting d'Eon as a prolific artist willing to try his hand at any sound regardless of how it fits him. Precedent aside, <i>Arc of Fire</i> does feel like a distinctive, and necessary, shift for the artist, as d'Eon's oft-pained vocals and diaristic lyrics, along with his dorm-room-bull-session conceptualism, are largely absent here. (The latter element isn't entirely gone: the name Kallisti references an element of Greek mythology that represents, according to a press release, ""Vanity, discord, and chaos,"" the knowledge of which proves inessential in enjoying what d'Eon's done here.)</p>
<p>The Kallisti project may be rooted in genre pastiche, but d'Eon wears these new-for-him sounds quite well, making <i>Arc of Fire</i> his strongest and most cohesive release yet. The inescapable rush and psychedelic rhythms packed into the EP's most engaging moments, tempered with a few gorgeous melodic passages, suggest that d'Eon is a capable student of the sub-genre of dance music that he is so dutifully referencing.<i> Arc of Fire</i> is the second release for NORELATION, an offshoot of NYC label UNO, an imprint that has made a name for itself in 2013 with an increasingly intriguing roster of producers making dance music that falls far left of center, from SFV Acid's ramshackle analog haze to the distorted, eraser-in-your-ear techno favored by Gobby. <i>Arc of Fire</i> scratches a similarly niche itch, but its straightforward approach to the past is less ingenious by design than other releases on the label. (If anything, there's more in common here with the artists responsible for NORELATION's first release, defunct California duo LOL Boys, who similarly struggled to carve out an individual voice during their short, intermittently intriguing run.)</p>
<p><i>Arc of Fire </i>may lack fresh ideas, but d'Eon does pull a few surprises out of his bag—notably, on ""Millennial"", which features the collection's boldest sample choice: the chorus to Backstreet Boys' 1998 mega-hit ""I Want It That Way"". d'Eon chops up the once-ubiquitous single's chorus, pitching the vocals down and throwing drum-machine detritus into the mix before launching into a smooth traditionalist jungle break. Reasonably, the use of what could be considered as pure kitsch as sample material carries the potential to rub discerning listeners the wrong way, especially in the post-quality flood of ephemera that threatens to strangle much of digital culture; it's a testament to d'Eon's talents, then, that he's able to wring pure pleasure out of what could have been a toxic conceit, with the results ending up not dissimilarly to Chicago footwork legend DJ Roc's Robin Thicke flip ""Lost Without U"".</p>
<p>As a whole, the EP is a considerable leap from an artist that was on the verge of being written off as one of the constantly burgeoning Montreal scene's also-rans, which makes d'Eon's next artistic move specifically crucial. An irritating development in North American experimental electronic music over the last several years—especially in regard to those young artists who fall into the ""bedroom producer"" grouping—has been a willingness to shift from style to style, often foregoing personal refinement in favor for whatever sound is currently in vogue. Some interesting music has come from this widespread try-anything-once attitude, but a dangerous by-product has been an overall lack of distinctiveness from the artists involved. If d'Eon continues to push himself in <i>Arc of Fire</i>'s promising direction instead of becoming distracted by whatever comes along next, he could end up with something even more substantial–and, more importantly, new-sounding.</p></div>"|18814.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18814-arc-of-fire-ep/|6.7|Larry Fitzmaurice

On Twitter, he’s suffered slings and arrows from both <a href=""https://twitter.com/1000TimesYes/status/276407069983268864"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the senior editor of a major music site</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/_moonb_/status/394483591897288704"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an obscure beatmaker alike</a>, which seems strange given he’s released primarily a string of cassettes and CDRs in microscopic editions before releasing a proper debut on the PAN label in 2011. But with Warwick’s chintzy synths deployed for live performance—not to mention his glasses and his shirt tucked-into his khakis—perhaps it’s simply a matter of high school bullying the geekiest kid in the classroom carrying over into adulthood.</p>
<p>For his second PAN release, <i>Re-Engineering</i>, Warwick draws on a wide range of influences, be it his own art exhibition at the Kinderhook &amp; Caracas gallery in Berlin, avant-garde dance music, or an overheard snippet of a street busker belting out an Oasis cover on public transport. The opening title track “Re-Engineering” takes a stomping beat, dilutes it with a watery keyboard line and then introduces a vocal from fellow multi-disiplinary artist Hanne Lippard. In her chilliest voice, Lippard recites text featured in Warwick’s aforementioned <a href=""http://kinderhook-caracas.com/sicherheitsdienst"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">exhibit</a>, a cluster of catchphrases ranging from “Gay Google” to “A poem is a machine made of words” to the Darby Crash adage “What we do is secret,” the cumulative effect feeling nonsensical or that meaning could only be gleaned were you to have been at the opening.</p>
<p>“E-Scape” uses warped undulating keyboard lines to mesmeric effect, sounding not wholly dissimilar to Pac-Man in Ouroboros mode. The third track, “Mimosa"", also accentuates the cheap textures of Warwick’s synthesizers, adds in some saxophone warbles and subliminal murmurs, looping it all so that it drifts into something kin to African composer <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Francis-Bebey-African-Electronic-Music-1975-1982/master/496345"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Francis Bebey’s whimsical electronic explorations</a>. Both are low-key but charming.</p>
<p>Intellectually sophisticated but prone to using primitive musical effects to convey such messages, Warwick’s results vary wildly after that. Balancing between the two extremes is a hard trick, one that even the most garlanded producers have trouble maintaining, be they <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/980-matmos/"" target=""_blank"">Matmos</a>, Terre Thaemlitz or Matthew Herbert. (This writer would also contend that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a> was better served hinting at queer theory circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4590-silent-shout/"" target=""_blank""><i>Silent Shout</i></a> rather than being overt on this year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17847-the-knife-shaking-the-habitual/"" target=""_blank""><i>Shaking the Habitual</i></a>.) A samba guitar powers “Watermark"",” but again Lippard’s vocals act as simulacra of a voiceover on promo CDs. “Speculative” features the sort of driving beat, finger snap, stand-up bassline, closed hi-hat ticks and echoing cello combination that reminds me of many thrilling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"" target=""_blank"">Arthur Russell</a> dance sides, but the vocals of Jesse Garcia --plainspoken and dry like Russell’s own vocal delivery—favors multisyllabic and verbose mots like “gelatinous” “bifurcation” and “congealing” undercutting what’s otherwise a decent dancefloor track.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p>Not that one should expect ecstatic vocal house from the Heatsick project, but almost whenever vocals do appear on the album, they distract rather than serve the track in question. Only on the playful thump of “Dial Again"", again using Garcia’s vocals in a far more campy setting, does the vocal elevate the track, as here the line recalls many an early Italo and house track. Were the beats stronger elsewhere, it would even out, but even on something with a propulsive beat like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16317-clear-chanel/"" target=""_blank"">“Clear Chanel""</a>, that pulse gets buried in iridescent synth layers to where only the snare really gets through. But on standouts like the gurgling “Après-Moi, Le Déluge!” and the acid-tinged pistoning of “Emerge,” Heatsick shows that he can craft smart yet sinuous tracks that can make both lovers and haters move.</p></div>"|18786.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18786-heatsick-re-engineering/|6.8|Andy Beta

Two of its members, bassist Toby Driver and guitarist Kevin Hufnagel, have logged recent time in some of heavy metal’s more dense and complicated units. Hufnagel counters Luc Lemay in the relaunched version of Gorguts and plays guitar with perpetually knotty instrumental trio Dysrhythmia. Driver, meanwhile, is the mastermind of the ever-recondite <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2394-kayo-dot/"" target=""_blank"">Kayo Dot</a> and a survivor of the wonderfully exploratory maudlin of the Well. The pedigree of the band’s other half—drummer Charlie Schmid and leader, vocalist and guitarist Josh Strawn—is less metallic but nevertheless impressive and important: They both played in the lightly gothic Religious to Damn. That band’s hypnotic rock mirrored, at least in part, Strawn’s chilling post-punk standouts in Blacklist. So, just how intricate and truculent can Vaura be?</p>
<p>No matter what the credits might suggest, <i>The Missing</i>—Vaura’s second album in as many years and first for Profound Lore—is not altogether intimidating, either stylistically or technically. Sure, there are blast beats and wave-of-treble black metal guitars. There’s some doom lurch and even a touch of industrial disorientation. And the compositions aren’t exactly simple. “Passage to Vice” is a Rube Goldberg contraption of rhythms, with pianos and drums, guitars and vocals bouncing off of one another at just the right angles and moments to bloom into a chorus. During a late-song break, “Incomplete Burning” sprints down a spiral staircase of complication, colorful riffs wrapping like quickly growing vines around the structure. The eight-minute closer moves through slinking post-rock and pulsing New Wave, with Strawn lifting lyrics liberally <a href=""http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/Metamorph6.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">from Ovid’s <i>Metamorphoses</i></a>. But there’s a core of incandescent pop at the center of <i>The Missing</i>, too, an anchor that pulls its songs together as Vaura bridges post-punk and black metal, feathered atmospherics and cavalier dexterity. Though <i>The Missing</i> is intense enough to remind you of its members’ respective histories, it is at times disarmingly catchy and surprisingly bright.</p>
<p>There’s perhaps no better summary of Vaura’s success here than “Passage to Vice”, a tune so metrically poised that every piece seems to move in reaction to another. But Strawn speak-sings his way through the verses and stretches out in the hooks. He handles the words with the sort of cool aplomb that suggests the best work of Pinback. Gloom notwithstanding, you’ll want to follow him through the various slinks and soars, to sing along. And there’s “The Fire”, which shrieks open after a lengthy introduction with the most aggressive guitar layers and drum blitzes on the album. The beat is heavy during the verses, but it flares upward as it enters the chorus, dual guitars retrenching the obsidian escalation—that is, the parts you’d normally expect to be the most abrasive and potentially off-putting only bolster Strawn’s exquisite refrain. It’s not a novel technique, as you can hear similar moves from most every atmospheric black metal act. It does, however, illustrate Vaura’s aim of accessibility on <i>The Missing</i>. Alternately, “Incomplete Burning” eases up on its torrent of drums and guitars as it enters the chorus, finding an unexpected middle point between metal and mid-90s college rock. It does not sound altogether unlike the Gin Blossoms’ “Hey Jealousy”.</p>
<p><i>Selenelion</i>, Vaura’s very good 2012 debut, was a touch longer than <i>The Missing</i>, in part because it incorporated more disparate elements. There was downtrodden folk and a little Sonic Youth-style squall, unabashed deathrock homage, and a touch of tech-metal maul. It felt almost like a DJ mix of its members’ interests, pivoting from one look to another competently, but without too much worry about making it all work as a whole. <i>The Missing</i> not only better integrates these elements but dispatches with some of the more superfluous ones. There’s no folksy interlude, and there are no unnecessary solos. As the record pushes toward its more doleful back half, Strawn’s gothic past wedges toward the spotlight, especially on the excellent and gray “The Things That We All Hide”. It doesn’t feel abrupt. Rather, without those previous distractions, all of these pieces fit into a more cohesive picture, and the melodies ring out that much clearer.</p>
<p>Watching the rollout of reactions to <i>The Missing </i>has offered an intriguing look at the expectations placed upon artists because of their past. To wit, <a href=""http://www.metalsucks.net/2013/10/25/theres-plenty-missing-vauras-new-album/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Metal Sucks </i>dismissed</a> <i>The Missing</i> outright for its seeming omission of heaviness, decrying its “fake smoke and eyeliner, lacking any of the blood and sweat and grit that infuses raw life into metal.” But at <i>Echoes and Dust</i>, <a href=""http://echoesanddust.com/2013/10/vaura-the-missing/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a reviewer commended</a> the hints of the National and U2 nestled into its heaviness. Writing for <i>Decibel</i>, <a href=""http://www.decibelmagazine.com/featured/sucker-for-punishment-go-big-or-gtfo/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Adrien Begrand lauded</a> its ambitious mix of post-punk and black metal and Strawn’s “high-gloss 1986-87” gothic tendencies. He called it a “challenging listen,” though, but here I am mentioning Armistead Burwell Smith IV, the Gin Blossoms, and Mogwai. <i>The Missing</i>, then, seems like a meticulous collage, where the parts that mean the most to you are the parts you’ll find the fastest. Maybe there won’t be enough metal or enough solos or enough eyeliner, or maybe there will be too much of all of it. I sometimes wish it dipped down into mid-tempo trods a bit less. Still, on <i>The Missing, </i>Vaura’s stylistic composite is decisive and deliberate, putting those pedigrees to use in a surprising and somehow entirely sensible fashion. </p></div>"|18545.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18545-vaura-the-missing/|7.5|Grayson Currin

The primary narrative was, of course, the Great Black Flag Debacle of 2013, a yearlong mire of dueling reunions, media mudslinging, a failed lawsuit and—less than a week prior to the record's street date—a face-palm-inducing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53155-ron-reyes-leaves-black-flag/"" target=""_blank"">fallout with vocalist Ron Reyes</a>, who appears on the album. In this tabloid-ready context, it wasn't surprising that advance press for <i>What The...</i> took the form of a web-wide snarkfest over the album cover rather than a serious look at three advance singles, the first new music in 28 years from one of the great American rock bands.</p>
<p>The dwarfing of Black Flag's output by their legend is nothing new. At this stage, any casual indie-rock fan can recount the saga: the police scuffles, the grueling practice regimen and trailblazing cross-country tours, that indelible Raymond Pettibon logo. Even the band's evolution from anthemic hardcore crew to sadistic sludge collective—encapsulated on the once-controversial, now-canonical second side of the <i>My War</i> LP—has become part of their mystique. Miraculously, the music retains the power to shock. Could this scrappy SoCal punk band really have produced, in just 10 years, such a weird cornucopia of sounds? The fist<i>-</i>meets-mirror blow of<i> Damaged</i> is one thing, but what about the frenetic sass of <i>Nervous Breakdown</i>, the feel-bad art blues of <i>Slip It In</i>, and the DIY-fusion instrumentals of <i>The Process of Weeding Out</i>?</p>
<p>Henry Rollins became Black Flag's poster boy, but the man responsible for their maverick trajectory was Greg Ginn, a musician justly renowned as hardcore's greatest instrumentalist. He complemented his guitar concept—queasy, untameable, calculatedly <i>wrong</i>; the perfect aural translation of Black Flag's unraveling-mind narratives—with a resolute aesthetic restlessness. Ginn played a game of chicken with his audience up through Black Flag's 1986 break-up and then just kept right on going, segueing into more than quarter century of self-indulgent endeavors, some intermittently inspired (Gone, Jambang, the Killer Tweeker Bees), some severely patience-testing (Mojack, Hor, El Bad), and nearly all completely ignored by both the punk orthodoxy and the jam-band and electronica scenes he began looking to for inspiration. That trend continued right up through 2012, when Ginn was still touring with the Royal We, a solo project in which he plays guitar and theremin along with minimal digi-funk backing tracks.</p>
<p>It's in this context that the flawed yet fascinating <i>What The…</i> begins to makes sense. The record's designation as a Black Flag comeback feels completely arbitrary. Sure, its contents bear a superficial resemblance to phase-one Black Flag: it is, in the most general sense, a record of brief, blaring ill-tempered punk songs. In reality, though, it's simply another Greg Ginn brainspew—the latest dispatch from a mercurial, hyperprolific genius who has never had much use for self-editing. Consider this Robert Pollard-ian statistic: on February 26, 2013, just as the Black Flag/FLAG controversy was heating up, Ginn released no fewer than three new, totally unrelated records—the latest dispatches from the Royal We and Mojack, and <i>Life Is Too Short to Not Hold a Grudge</i> (the debut by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31155-good-for-you/"" target=""_blank"">Good for You</a>, Ginn's collaboration with vocalist and pro skateboarder Mike Vallely), a respectable album that serves as a more logical sequel to the final first-generation Black Flag LP, <i>In My Head</i>, than <i>What The…</i> Former Black Flag bassist Kira Roessler made the shrewdest-yet statement on Ginn's current reboot of the band when she pegged him as a perpetual ""moving target"" in an <a href=""http://doublecrossxx.com/kira-roessler-discusses-the-current-state-of-black-flag/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with the hardcore blog Double Cross last May. The names Ginn assigns to his projects—even something as seemingly momentous as a new incarnation of Black freaking Flag—are just details; the point is the unforgiving pace, the neverending assembly line that is his creative mind.</p>
<p>Still, to an extent, we have to take <i>What The…</i> at face value, which means considering it in the context of the existing Black Flag discography and coming to terms with why it doesn't measure up. Part of the problem is a simple human-resources issue. In the past, the band worked best when strong personalities—bassists Roessler and Chuck Dukowski, drummers Robo and Bill Stevenson, frontmen Rollins and Keith Morris—counterweighted and clashed with Ginn's snarling riffs and frayed leads, both impressively undiminished and easily the strongest features of <i>What The…</i> Vocalist Ron Reyes, who fronted Black Flag for a brief but fruitful period in 1979-80 turns out to be a surprisingly compelling Ginn foil. The rudimentary, uninspired rhythm section—Ginn himself on bass, appearing under the Dale Nixon pseudonym he used on <i>My War</i>, and his longtime collaborator Gregory ""Drummer"" Moore—is another story. But iffy execution isn't the main culprit. The record's greatest weakness is its stunted vision: <i>What The…</i> contains flashes of brilliance, but there simply aren't enough good ideas here, musical or lyrical, to sustain a 22-song, 42-minute record.</p>
<p>To its credit, <i>What The…</i> has a consistent sound and mood. It's a hectic, seemingly willfully grating album with a madcap, almost cartoonish feel, epitomized by Ginn's theremin, which turns up frequently as a kitschy accent. The style of the record might be called punk, but it's a punk that feels distinctly 90s, with loud, funky, extroverted bass and swaggery, cornily danceable cadences. (For a representative sample, spend 98 seconds with ""Shut Up."") In fact, the most Black Flag-ish aspect of these songs might be the way that—in keeping with the album cover—they defy the dumbed-down caricature of the band as the quintessentially angsty first-wave hardcore outfit, opting instead for a cocky flamboyance that's at odds with the lyrics' generic harangues against fools and fakers.</p>
<p>As baffling as the record's aesthetic is, it yields a handful of really good songs. These make up roughly a third of the album's 22 tracks; issued as an EP, they would've made a much stronger impression than the precariously bloated package that is <i>What The...</i> The crowning jewel is ""The Chase"", an uptempo two-minute rager propelled by a series of lean, vicious Ginn riffs, each crisper and more catchy than the last. The guitarist's instrumental expression once seemed like the work of an antisocial sadist, but here, as is often the case on <i>What The…</i>, it registers more as the expression of an unflappable stuntman—closer to Dick Dale than Sonny Sharrock. Ginn is similarly incendiary on ""Down in the Dirt"", where he combines spiky eccentricity with no-nonsense rhythmic drive, illustrating anew his wizardly ability to propel a band while at the same time indulging his twisted imagination. Here, his lines act as a kind of shadow lead vocal, augmenting and enhancing Ron Reyes's squalid narrative.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Reyes is the unlikely star. For much of the album, he capably portrays the malcontent manchild that is the immortal Black Flag Narrator; on certain tracks, though, he puts his own stamp on the role, summoning a histrionic swagger that's well-suited to the material. On ""Now Is the Time"", he practically croons, nodding to Iggy Pop's stagy baritone. During ""Off My Shoulders"", egged on by Ginn's raunchy crunch, he takes the act a step further, verging on Glenn Danzig's curled-lip machismo.</p>
<p>Convincing moments aside, the experience of listening to <i>What The…</i> is mostly a matter of sifting through numbing tedium in search of the next misshapen Greg Ginn pearl: the masterfully scribbly solo in ""My Heart's Pumping"", the noxious noise bridge in ""Slow Your Ass Down"", a series of strangulated stun bursts in ""Lies"". Ginn and Moore's rhythm section is a constant stumbling block. They have exactly two settings—a leaden half-time strut and a cowpunky double-time bounce—and zero dynamic range. The record's lopsided mix, in which a deafening field of guitar drowns out the bass and already puny-sounding drums, only foregrounds this deficiency.</p>
<p>Much of the musical material is equally rickety. Too many songs here feel like aggregations of quirky, tossed-off riffs. Tracks like ""I'm Sick"", ""This Is Hell,"" and ""Wallow in Despair"" are at once so busy and so inert—borderline nauseating in their repetitiveness and indistinguishability—that their titles seem meta. As any fan of mid-to-late-period Black Flag knows, Greg Ginn has never been one to shy away from an aural staring contest; on <i>What The…</i>, though, the perversity of the music often sounds like the result of rushed songwriting rather than purposeful provocation.</p>
<p>The same is true of the lyrics. To peg them as generally bad is close to an objective statement of fact; to single out representative examples seems almost cruel. Henry Rollins shouted innumerable clunkers during his tenure in the band, but lines like this, from ""Blood and Ashes,"" represent a new low: ""Will you concede to my carnal desire?/ Or will you condemn me for what I aspire?"" Then there's the spoken monologue on ""Lies""—""I live with my anxiety and my angst/ I'm okay with my fear and my doubt/ It's just that I despise what <i>you</i> possess""—which could easily pass as a Fred Armisen-style parody of overserious hardcore. It could be the case that Ginn and Reyes are putting their listeners on throughout <i>What The…</i>, satirizing the staleness of punk rock's middle-finger stance. But it's more likely that the antisocial bluster Reyes yowls on ""The Bitter End"", ""Get Out of My Way"", and countless other songs here was—as much of the music on <i>What The…</i> seems to have been—simply the first thing that came to mind.</p>
<p>In a way, the saddest thing about <i>What The...</i> isn't its glaring shortcomings; it's the fact that, in spots, the record shows real potential. The handful of strong songs have heart and spunk and direction—about as much as one could hope for from the renewed collaboration of two ornery vets such as Ginn and Reyes. Given some time to jell, this version of the band might've eventually developed its own special chemistry, added its own wrinkle to Black Flag's convoluted timeline. But in light of Reyes's departure, <i>What The...</i> will forever be remembered as a stillborn curiosity, a memento of the year that the Black Flag legacy exploded.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what Ginn's next move is, but chances are, whether he's operating under the Black Flag name or one of his countless other brands, his M.O. isn't going to change much. (Case in point: on the same day as <i>What The...</i> drops, Ginn's SST imprint is re-releasing the Good for You LP with no fewer than 29 bonus tracks.) Will the inevitable meteoric thrills be worth the equally inevitable stretches of boredom and bafflement? That's for each listener to decide. Just as it always has, this target keeps on moving.</p></div>"|18763.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18763-black-flag-what-the/|4.9|Hank Shteamer

A subsequent collaboration seemed natural, so earlier this year Flume and Faker, aka Nicholas Murphy, holed up on Australia’s South Coast for a week of recording that culminated in the three-track <i>Lockjaw</i> EP.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"">Postal Service</a> imitation ""This Song Is Not About A Girl"" (the title says it all, but the briskly driving hi-hats and light vocal effects certainly don’t help) is the EP's only misstep, which admittedly means more in the context of three songs than it would on a full-length. Still, <i>Lockjaw</i> is a solid statement of intent. Streten hasn't ruled out the possibility of a future album with Murphy, and the excellent singles ""Drop the Game"" and ""What About Us"" give listeners an idea of what that would look like. Despite Streten's insistence that the songs aren't like anything either has done before, not to mention both artists’ versatility—Flume <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymIseyI4OHU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remixes bangers</a> for Mad Decent as easily as he builds pretty, twinkling tracks like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14617-star-eyes/"">“Star Eyes”</a>, and Murphy adeptly covers both <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfFA8-RaHQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“No Diggity”</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMIF93jqRN8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Archangel”</a>—<i>Lockjaw</i> succeeds when it doesn’t stray far from the template set by “Left Alone”.</p>
<p>""Game"" is probably the most fully realized track on the EP, complete with a <a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2013/11/18/245487762/first-watch-chet-faker-drop-the-game"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">painstakingly stylized video</a> featuring Brooklyn dancer Storyboard P, whose unnervingly fluid stop-motion movements in a deserted nighttime warehouse district is a good visual representation of Flume and Faker's collaborative relationship: he moves to the beat and sometimes mouths Murphy's supple tenor, which catches and flows in all the right places over Streten's stuttering drums. ""What About Us"" showcases both artists' ranges, opening with the crackle of an old recording and Murphy's falsetto, eventually incorporating a saxophone bursting forth like an afterthought during the closing piano chords.</p>
<p>It's no coincidence that the titular question of that song is a point of contention or forward motion in most relationships, including Flume and Chet Faker's. They work best together when Streten foregrounds Murphy's soulful intonation, which cultivates an intimacy that's made his opening slot on Flume's most recent tour more inviting than the headliner, who keeps graduating to bigger venues and drop-hungry audiences. When Flume's production dominates on <i>Lockjaw</i>, as on ""This Song"", it disrupts the EP's sultry, slowed-down aesthetic. Like any good producer, Streten has an ear for appropriate melodies and more often than not knows when to step back and let Murphy take the spotlight. And there's nothing wrong with experimentation this early in the game, so to speak—just as long as they don't drop it.</p></div>"|18798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18798-flume-chet-faker-lockjaw-ep/|7.0|Harley Brown

The effect is like hearing a guitar player’s fingers slide across strings: It reinforces the idea of the voice as a physical instrument, limited by the body that creates it and unadulterated by any studio adjustments. Including and accentuating those breaths is an easy yet effective vocal technique to convey intimacy and spontaneity, as though you could play “My Beloved” again and it might sound subtly, eerily different.</span></p>
<p>“Spontaneous” is the key word there. <i>Blood/Lines</i> is White’s fourth album in four years. She pieced these nine songs (eleven, if you count the two bonus tracks on the U.S. version) from more than one hundred song sketches penned during a 22-month period, and she recorded them with a small group of collaborators that includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3108-marissa-nadler/"">Marissa Nadler</a>. Those are her ""oohs""in the background of “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16262-faster-than-the-devil-ft-marissa-nadler/"">Faster Than the Devil</a>”, adding a lush cushion for the thundering two-note guitar line and White’s race with her own demons.</p>
<p>By its very Frankenstein nature, <i>Blood/Lines</i> doesn’t hold together quite as well as White’s previous albums. It sprawls and stretches, prizing sustained melancholy over concise arrangements. And yet, that rocky quality only reinforces the volatile emotions embedded in her lyrics and underscores both the vulnerability of her vocals and their prickly resolve. Those two extremes, along with her downcast arrangements and breathy vocals, have earned White endless comparisons with Hope Sandoval and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"" target=""_blank"">PJ Harvey</a>, two musicians who have proved especially influential to subsequent generations of female musicians. Yet, in its personal scope and its emphasis on a live sound, this music is resolutely Californian in nature, a bleaker version of West Coast country rock: Big Sur goth.</p>
<p><i>Blood/Lines </i>is best when White finds different ways to achieve that darkly dramatic sound. She drapes these songs in a heavy tapestry of reverb, which threatens to swallow the instruments whole. As a result, the guitar sounds especially sinister, the cello sloshes like rising water, the piano needles and cajoles the listener. The synths and especially the chimes, on the other hand, come across as rote, obligatory: shorthand for easy melancholy. “Wake”, one of the more musically involved numbers, stops cold to indulge some doo wop vocals on the bridge, and the transition is jarring in the best way: unexpected, yet apt, which throws the song in sharp relief. Rather than explore those contrasts, however, the song simply reverts to form, building gradually to a fairly predictable organ-drenched climax.</p>
<p>On its lengthy intro “My Beloved” lets every instrument—guitar, cello, piano—take turns with the lead, as if each is an actor taking a bow. It’s another way to reinforce the live quality of the music, and the friction it creates between the distancing reverb. White alternately invites listeners into her world and keeps them at arms’ length, and that toggling between direct confession and emotional opacity illuminates the best moments on <i>Blood/Lines</i>. She comes across like an artist who makes music by constantly calculating what to give her audience and what to withhold. </p></div>"|18797.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18797-emily-jane-white-bloodlines/|6.6|Stephen M.

The band had come to a more gradual, quiet ending. ""I was the only person living in San Francisco. ... We were getting together when we could,"" he <a href=""http://www.mtvhive.com/2013/10/14/sic-alps-mike-donovan-band-breakup-solo-career/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. That information is interesting when you consider the relative minimalism of 2012's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17030-sic-alps/"">Sic Alps</a>. </i>Their final full-length featured some solitary moments from Donovan, like on ""Thylacine Man"" or ""Lazee Son"". (The album also featured more full, garage-resembling tracks like ""Moviehead"".) Earlier this year, the band released their last statement, the <i>She's on Top </i>EP—three muscular rock songs accompanied by three music videos. ""I was super happy with that last version of the band,"" Donovan said. ""And I think the end is important, so it seemed like a good time to end it."" On the last date of their subsequent tour, Donovan told the audience that it was Sic Alps' final show.</p>
<p>On the outside, it felt like an oddly definitive move for Sic Alps, which had been a constantly shifting, amorphous entity. But separated from his band, Donovan had found an available collaborator in his old friend Eric Park. Donovan, Park, and John Dwyer had a band for a while called <a href=""http://www.thestranger.com/lineout/archives/2011/10/28/today-in-jon-dwyer-yikes-a-rare-jon-dwyer-incarnation"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yikes</a>. Understandably, when Donovan approached Park to start a new band, he was expecting to make some ""far-out"" weirdo music. Instead, the two started bonding over Bob Dylan and Merle Haggard. So they set up in the studio, two dudes with two acoustic guitars, and made <i>Wot</i>. Their songs smack of Sic Alps more isolated material, which is good—<i>Sic Alps</i> showed that Donovan can thrive in more stripped down moments.</p>
<p>But then <i>Wot</i>'s opening track offers more of a ""campfire jam"" vibe. At times, Donovan and Park tempt hokiness, which is potentially a huge problem. In the worst instances, having multiple acoustic instruments ring out at the same time can feel saccharine. (Think <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SMLz32Axd4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the New Christy Minstrels</a>.) ""New Fieldhand Bop"" sounds almost overwhelmingly sunny at moments, especially when he hits the bridge: ""Don't want money, 'cause I got some melodies."" The sentiment feels reminiscent of Patton Oswalt's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1otPZdd1TnQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">impression</a> of Austin and Portland expats: ""You mean I can't pay for sandwiches with a song?""</p>
<p>Thankfully, as the album continues on its acoustic drive, the two guitarists aren't bogged down by optimism or too-cheerful melodies. The ballads here are arguably some of the best moments. And they're wise enough to keep <i>Wot </i>sonically diverse. It's actually a relief when they go electric on ""Do Do Ya?"" (though the song is still paced and minimal, of course). And they're really good at playing guitar: At the beginning of the all-instrumental ""Baroque Ass"", the two men finger-pick two opposing, complex, and somehow complementary melodies. Then, they soften the flashy stuff with a gentle harmonica solo. </p>
<p>Donovan's voice isn't especially booming, deep, flashy, or cartoonish. It's subdued, earthy, and oddly calming. He can spit out lyrics with an effortlessly cool repose, occasionally spilling his words with a Bolan-esque warble. It's a voice that sounds really good next to a loud acoustic guitar—since it's more reserved, the vocals and instrumentals consistently have equal footing.</p>
<p>As the first outing recorded under his own name, <i>Wot </i>puts Donovan in two difficult positions. Not only does it have to live up to the catalog and reputation of his old band, but it's a singer/songwriter album being released by Drag City—the label that puts out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"">Callahan</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/351-bonnie-prince-billy/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Oldham</a> records. Occasionally, Donovan will sing something like ""roll away the stone,"" and his well-tread imagery tends to land with a thud. Perhaps the idea here was to write songs that are earnest and universal like old country ballads. ""Still in Town"", for example, is a complete heartbreaker akin to a George Jones song. Sometimes, though, his sentiments are packaged too tidily; it's difficult to pinpoint the central character and beating heart behind <i>Wot</i>. It's consistently sonically impressive and captivating, especially when he ushers in a horn section or backs an instrumental track with a haunting whistle. But <i>Wot</i> doesn't feel like an especially personal outpour—it's a well-crafted record that's lyrically dwarfed by the old emoting masters.</p></div>"|18659.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18659-mike-donovan-wot/|6.4|Evan Minsker

Capsule, his personal outfit alongside singer Toshiko Koshijima, racked up critical accolades while his more mainstream projects changed the nation’s pop landscape. Recently, his influence has spread across the sea—North American artists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26765-passion-pit/"" target=""_blank"">Passion Pit</a> cite his sound as an inspiration, while his fill-every-second-of-the-track approach predicted the booming EDM sound (popular producer Zedd has mentioned Nakata in interviews).</p>
<p><i>Caps Lock, </i>Capsule’s 14th studio album and first for Warner Music Japan, could have been his opportunity to jump into the EDM scene he helped shape and turn the spotlight on himself. Instead, he’s made an album thematically structured around a computer keyboard. This is Nakata’s most spacious creation yet, a recording that finds the usually manic Nakata taking time to let ideas develop slowly and indulge in some experimentation. He’s chasing down his own artistic ideas—after spending so long developing others—and ends up with a muted full-length. It isn’t his best work, but it’s among his most interesting.</p>
<p>Nakata's decision to mix things up isn’t a huge surprise, however. Capsule has always been a shifty group sonically, originally working with the globe-hopping sounds of Shibuya-kei, a late-90s style popularized by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/832-cornelius/"" target=""_blank"">Cornelius</a> and Pizzicato Five. Those artists jumped to pounding, club-friendly electro-pop, which the pair explored up until the more headphone-friendly <i>Caps Lock</i>. Nakata has included one excellent gateway into his music here with “Control"", a busy number highlighting the cornerstones of his production style. Save for a sparse intro, “Control” bounces forward on a cascade of synthesizers and Koshijima’s digitally warped vocals. He even stuffs in some laser sounds, a nod to his earliest constructions. </p>
<p>Yet nearly everything else on <i>Caps Lock </i>finds Nakata entering new territory. Whereas nearly all his past work burst into life right away, the songs here take their time to develop. “Delete” and “Space” start as minimalistic chugs, Nakata introducing new sonic elements slowly as each plods ahead. His newfound interest in delayed gratification is intriguing, but Nakata still needs to work on finding a climax, as both “Delete” and “Space” press forward without ever reaching a real payoff. It brings to mind the similarly aimless work of (frequent Capsule comparison) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a> on the <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14938-tron-legacy-ost/"" target=""_blank"">Tron: Legacy</a> </i>soundtrack.</p>
<p>Nakata also shows off a newfound interest in sampled sounds on <i>Caps Lock. </i>A ticking clock appears during the first leg of “Delete” and plays a more prominent role on “Esc"". The latter track is the most left-field work he’s ever done, less a song and more a field recording of a haunted attic complete with footsteps and whispers. “12345678” places sampled sounds of floorboard creaks and a car horn into a more conventional song structure, and this collage approach makes for an interesting three-minute experiment. Unfortunately, the song lasts just over six minutes, and Nakata’s charming approach soon turns tiring.</p>
<p>Of all the changes to Capsule’s music on this album, the only big misfire is Nakata’s decision to rely on Koshijima’s voice less in his final mixes. She only appears on half of the songs here, and in two instances she’s reduced to nothing much more than single-syllable topping, her addition failing to add much to either “Delete” or “Space"". It’s not that Koshijima boasts great chops—every singer Nakata has worked with gets put through layers of digital manipulation. Yet the processed singing fits in seamlessly in Nakata’s buzzing tracks, and add warmth to his songs. The two best songs on <i>Caps Lock </i>are the ones that let Koshijima linger; on a song like “Shift"", Nakata slices up his singer’s words thin but also rearrange them into catchy android speak.</p>
<p><i>Caps Lock </i>is the sound of a producer who has spent the last few years dealing almost exclusively with the demands of pop songwriting getting the chance to dump a bunch of ideas out of his head at once, resulting in an album that’s all over the place. It’s a strange, albeit brave, album, given Nakata's current visibility. <i>Caps Lock </i>isn’t the easiest entry into his music, but features enough great moments to hopefully make people dig into his rich past.   </p></div>"|18654.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18654-capsule-caps-lock/|6.1|Patrick St. Michel

It was the rare album of theirs to favor vaporous, smoke-ring ambience over the band’s notorious gavel-crushing wallop, and drifting, abstract lyricism over Cave’s usual scripture-scaled narratives. But it’s not like this risky low-key detour hurt their live draw: the Bad Seeds’ spring 2013 tours saw them selling out soft-seaters worldwide, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53030-nick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds-announce-north-american-tour/"" target=""_blank"">a recently released 2014 itinerary</a> sees them returning to many of the same markets at even bigger venues. Of course, it helped that Cave and co. amplified and adrenalized <i>Push the Sky Away</i>’s hushed tones with the assistance of guest string sections and children’s choirs, thereby placing the new material on equal footing with the old warhorses. But to prove just how on their game Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds were in 2013, the band offer us a portrait not of a typical night on the job, but of what they can do when chillin’ on a day off. </p>
<p><i>Live From KCRW</i> was recorded last April during the week separating the Bad Seeds’ two appearances at Coachella (where Cave, Warren Ellis, Martyn Casey, and Jim Sclavunos also pulled double duty with the their bastard-son band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5203-grinderman/"" target=""_blank"">Grinderman</a>), before a small studio audience at the station’s famed Santa Monica studios. And though the Bad Seeds discography is hardly lacking for concert documents—this counts as the fourth—<i>Live From KCRW</i> is, much like <i>Push the Sky Away</i> itself, something of a wild card among them. The Bad Seeds are without a doubt one of the most consistently exhilarating live acts in the biz, a band worthy of any discerning rock fan’s bucket list. But they’re also guilty at times of being a predictable one. Their setlists tend to showcase whatever new album’s being promoted alongside a familiar greatest-hits revue of their most canonical songs from the 1980s and 90s; to see the Bad Seeds on tour this year, you’d think <i>Push the Sky Away</i> was their first album since 1997, their shows rarely touching upon the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15476-let-love-in-murder-ballads-the-boatmans-call-no-more-shall-we-part/"" target=""_blank"">totemic works released</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15476-let-love-in-murder-ballads-the-boatmans-call-no-more-shall-we-part/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16884-reissues/"" target=""_blank"">in the interim</a>.</p>
<p>So Live From KCRW is distinguished not just by its loose, casual vibe—with Cave good-naturedly honoring audience requests, provided they’re “on this very short list”—but by its welcome variations from the standard Bad Seeds script with a healthy selection of deep cuts that don't get aired out that often. It begins with <i>Push the Sky Away</i>’s hazy-headed pocket history of modern civilization, “Higgs Boson Blues”, whose Miley Cyrus name-drops elicit audible giggles from the studio attendees. Its appearance here underscores just how perfectly Cave predicted her year, with the line “Hannah Montana/ Does the African Savannah” standing as an almost biblical prophecy of twerk-gate. And the song establishes a marked contrast here between the playful audience interaction and the solemnly reverential readings of some of the most understatedly devastating songs in the Cave songbook. The four <i>Push the Sky Away</i> selections find complementary counterparts in the sublimely sinister <i>Your Funeral My Trial</i> standout “Stranger Than Kindess”, the hymn-like title track to 2001’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15476-let-love-in-murder-ballads-the-boatmans-call-no-more-shall-we-part/"" target=""_blank""><i>No More Shall We Part</i></a>, and two selections from Cave’s other “quiet” album, <i>The Boatman’s Call</i>: the bittersweet anti-anthem “People Ain’t No Good” and an absolutely stunning “Far From Me” that allows more room for Conway Savage’s funereal organ lines to shine, transforming it from a simple break-up song to a requiem for the ruined relationship chronicled within. </p>
<p>The set’s meditative spell is broken only by the farewell dusting of the old <i>Henry’s Dream</i> rager “Jack the Ripper”, which is revelatory not just as a display of the Bad Seeds’ bruising muscle, but how much effort it takes to flex it. In concert, the Bad Seeds routinely perform with all the cocksure confidence of a band that’s seemingly never had an off night, but the amusing 90 seconds of banter that precede “Jack the Ripper”—wherein Cave confers with his mates about the proper chords and key—betrays a rare, up-close glimpse of the volatility at the root of their imposing sound. At the same time, <i>Live From KCRW</i> shows that the Bad Seeds’ power isn’t entirely dependent on volume. The set’s highlight is a skeletal, piano-based rendition of signature showstopper “The Mercy Seat” that shirks the original’s stormy, cinematic sweep to take us deeper inside the fragile psyche of the song’s electric-chair-bound protagonist; he may claim he’s “not afraid to die,” but the repeated, intensifying incantations of the chorus make his underlying sense of panic all too palpable. It is therefore no coincidence that, instead of a performance shot, the record's front cover photo shows Cave sitting by his lonesome in the studio amid a sprawl of equipment and road cases. The recordings within reveal the rationale: Even when the Bad Seeds perform in stripped-down mode, there is still much heavy lifting to do. </p></div>"|18760.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18760-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds-live-from-kcrw/|7.8|Stuart Berman

First, it wants your time: most of his albums are long (the five he’s made for Touch include three 2xCDs and a 3xCD set) and so are the individual pieces (of the 47 currently in my iTunes, 28 last over 20 minutes). The music itself is also demanding, comprising held tones without percussion or anything else conventionally used to mark time. (Niblock doesn’t actually play any instruments; instead he picks notes, records musicians peforming them, then edits and layers the results into drones.) Things change and progress, but it’s slow and subtle; you might not notice unless you skip around a track. So not only do you have to commit substantial time to a Niblock piece, you have to hang in when it feels like it’s taking a lot more.</p>
<p>Early on, Niblock made another demand: that you listen to his music at massive volumes in large spaces that create rich overtones. This wish meant that, as critic Bill Meyer put it, “It makes no more sense to play [Niblock albums] on earbuds or little computer speakers than it would to look at a reproduction of a Rothko on your mobile phone screen.” At first, this restriction kept Niblock from making records altogether. He started composing in the early 1970’s, but didn’t release his debut album, <i>Nothin' to Look at Just a Record</i>, until 1982. As he explains in the liner notes (reproduced in Superior Viaduct’s reissue), he didn’t want to “relinquish control,” but acquiesced in order to “reach all of the people that I would like to have experience the music.” He also added, in bold: “PLEASE PLAY THIS RECORD LOUD.”</p>
<p>So why are Niblock’s drones worth this much time and effort? What makes them better than others? It seems like it’d be an easy question, since minimalist drone on the surface is pretty uncomplicated. Yet, paradoxically, the simplicity of tones and apparent lack of change makes drone tricky to analyze. With most other music, you can point to hooks or shifts or moments that give a song unique power. With drone, pretty much the most you can say is that it moves you.</p>
<p>For me, that’s always been true of Niblock’s music. There’s a thrust to his drones; they never float or drift, always moving forward and often at high speed. Technically, that’s an illusion, since the music doesn’t have measurable pace. But on <i>Nothin' to Look at</i>, both sidelong pieces sound like they’re in perpetual motion. Sometimes they roll in waves; at other points they pulse like a buried heartbeat. There’s also a sense of ascent, especially on “A Trombone Piece”, which scales a sonic wall. That’s bit of an illusion too, since Niblock pre-planned his edits before he spliced the tapes, and thus could only guess at their effects. But I imagine he feels it too when he listens to his final compositions.</p>
<p>Once Niblock traded his tape splicer for computer software, he began to compose while editing rather than writing the pieces beforehand. That’s how he constructed the first disc in his new album, <i>Touch Five</i>, which contains two tracks: “Feedcorn Ear”, played on cello by Arne Deforce, and “A Cage of Stars”, which utilizes Rhodri Davies’ harp. Both are enveloping pieces whose only overt difference from what Niblock made 30 years ago is fidelity. They’re clearer and more detailed—easier to hear and focus on—than the rougher tracks on <i>Nothin' to Look at</i>. But they’re just as moving.</p>
<p>Even more exciting is <i>Touch Five</i>’s second disc, which uses a newer Niblock process: scores performed by musicians rather than created from their recordings. “Two Lips” is actually two scores with 20 parts total, all “distributed randomly amongst the musicians.” So the permutations could be infinite, especially since the piece is presented three times by three different guitar quartets. It’s not hard to hear the basic differences between the Zwerm Quartet, the Dither Quartet, and the Coh Da Quartet. What’s more complex is how each lineup creates a different atmosphere. The way each version conjures feelings and images (Niblock himself is a filmmaker, sometimes making films to accompany his music) shows how multi-dimensional his compositions are.</p>
<p>Which ultimately is what makes Niblock’s demands not only worth it, but somewhat irrelevant. You don’t have to accept any of them to enjoy his music. I’ve spent lots of time listening to his work on earbuds or computer speakers, and jumping around tracks rather than listening to each in full. Yet I’ve never left feeling unmoved. His drones are potent because they’re adaptable–whatever time or effort you put into them, you’ll always get something back.</p></div>"|18767.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18767-phill-niblock-nothin-to-look-at-just-a-record/|7.4|Marc Masters

Once upon a time, the Kansas City-bred musician was based in Brooklyn, playing in groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27672-woods/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">Woods</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28076-the-babies/"" target=""_blank"" title=""This external link will open in a new window"">the Babies</a>. Now, he lives in Los Angeles and has written <i>Harlem River</i>, a love letter to New York City that transforms its eponymous subject's long stretch of water into a metaphor for a wandering heart. </p>
<p>Within Woods’ discography, Morby's bass-playing wasn’t necessarily meant to suggest the existence of a richly detailed interior. Meanwhile, the Babies were formed from an inside joke and <a href=""http://www.pitch.com/kansascity/the-babies-our-house-on-the-hill-riot-room-november-2012/Content?oid=3069107"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>have been self-described</span></a> as a party band. <i>Harlem River</i> has the same emotional looseness as those groups, but its instrumental texture is more focused: it’s made up of intricately plucked acoustic guitars, shimmering organs, and electric guitars cutting through the negative space like a foglight. And, given the proper room to breathe, Morby’s voice reveals its lazy-day Kansan cadence, sounding not unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2714-cass-mccombs/"" target=""_blank"">Cass McCombs</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"" target=""_blank"">Kurt Vile</a>, or any guy with a guitar who’s got something to tell you.</p>
<p>What Morby has to say is unspecific, but no less true. On “Miles, Miles, Miles,” he alludes to the darkness the song’s protagonist has come from, while offering a wishful portrait of the place he’d like to be. The title track is slow and ponderous, Morby’s voice reduced to a muted creep as he seeks answers from a path showing no end. On “Slow Train”, he sings of not wanting to be destroyed by his temperament while wondering if he’s already missed his chance at redemption. That title, borrowed from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_Train_Coming"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the most spiritual of Bob Dylan albums</a>, is surely no coincidence. The song features Cate le Bon, a similarly-minded singer who on her most recent album offered the mournful admission: “I forget the detail/ but know the warmth.” That, more than anything, functions as an explanation of Morby’s creative ethos.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-37e7963e-9288-b32e-9c62-bc652e0535bd""><i>Harlem River </i><span>is mostly concerned with different shades of subtlety, which makes the rare overt moments stick out like </span><a href=""http://www.caprishop.com/images/toppa_anarchy.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>an anarchy patch</span></a><span> on a wedding dress. This is an album which references <i>Easy Rider</i> and Bob Dylan and has the temerity to sing a song called “Wild Side” (which is largely concerned with walking) in a recognizably Reedian drawl. That also means Morby’s perhaps quixotic intent to refashion himself as a 60s-era nomad is sometimes undercut by the limitations of his arrangements: the repeating breakdown in “Wild Side” is rhythm-disrupting brittle, and the cowpoke shuffle of “Reign” is a little too on-the-nose in its attempt to tell a modern outlaw tale. But those moments aren’t too distracting. Morby largely succeeds at taking us on his journey, imploring that the big ""Where am I going?"" question isn't so daunting so long as you keep collecting suggestions.</span></span></p></div>"|18796.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18796-kevin-morby-harlem-river/|7.0|Jeremy Gordon

By that metric, Bristol's Guy Middleton—who records as Guido—is knee-deep into a third reprise since his debut full-length dropped. While that particular strain of dubstep has fallen so far out of fashion in the interim as to be a virtually non-existent facet of the wider conversation, this affords favorable conditions for a follow-up. Neither long-since-advanced compatriots nor the decomposing remnants of a scene connive to make the sophomore effort look like a sore-thumb relic. On <i>Moods of Future Joy,</i> the only thing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28086-guido/"" target=""_blank"">Guido</a> is up against is himself. But that amounts to a tougher battle than expected. </p>
<p class=""p1""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14270-anidea/"" target=""_blank""><i>Anidea</i></a> was graceful, accessible, infectious, and above all immensely fun; a superb record that still stands up as perhaps the peak statement of a short-lived era. The marriage of surging bass swells and enormous hooks, sketched in tones cribbed from R&amp;B and bastardised P-funk, radiated color and not just the ""purple"" sound with which it become synonymous. That tag came to hamstring Gemmy and <a href=""%20http://pitchfork.com/artists/22494-joker/%20"" target=""_blank"">Joker</a>, fellow Bristolians in the triumvirate, whose blatant desire to shift away resulted in ill-fortune—total stasis in the case of the former, misguided crossover hybrids aimed at U.S. gamers in the case of the latter—something unwisely attempted in the sagging middle of <i>Moods</i> with the third rate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30305-tnght/"" target=""_blank"">TNGHT</a> blare of ""NRG"". During the heat of widespread interest, when sparkplug Joker was leading the pack with jagged bombast, Guido appeared more content to mosey behind, eyes fixed toward the sky, conjuring up moments of opulence, clarity and downright loveliness. Those exist here, but are populated more sparsely, and often take dull slogs to prise out.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Traditionally, Guido's classically-attuned ear has helped push his songs beyond the limitations of a relatively rudimentary digital setup. The healthy balance struck between floor-filling and after-hours appeal is an uncommon trait when juxtaposed with the sawtooth aggression of his then-peers. So it's disappointing to find <i>Moods</i> padded with a clutch of amateurish numbers that wouldn't warrant more than brief pause during any given Soundcloud trawl. The aforementioned ""NRG"" is one; the underwhelming ""Midnight Savannah"" another. Both vocal tracks prove to be missteps: Lead single 'Green Eyed Monster''s snaggy synth and lowpass scree make an awkward fit for Emma-Lou's undercooked contributions, and ""Letting Go"" would provide better support for her thin voice were it not for the lack of dynamism, letting flat beats topple weakly.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Guido's approach to embellishing tracks has lost some of its nuance, supplanted by a more clumsy approach to gluing certain elements together. Full-bodied percussive timbres, subdued pads and an echo-drenched guitar lead all build to a thrilling climax on ""Afrika Pt.2"", but only after a leaden UK funky beat is allowed far too much time to calcify while nakedly exposed, negating the final triumph. It's a recurring problem, weakening other strong set-pieces across the board. The grin-inducing bridge on ""Heartful Dodger"" evokes sinking into Super Mario pipes, but only as an escape mechanism from vocoder'd lyrics that fall worrying close to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/909-chromeo/"" target=""_blank"">Chromeo</a>'s whiny talkbox. Confusingly, the same cheap effect is utilised in a similarly irritating manner on ""Lucky Git"", distracting from a bouncing bassline and pensive synth lead that wouldn't sound out of place in an unearthed 2-step treasure from 1997. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Only two cuts<i> </i>really shine outright, and its no coincidence that both map out a softer deviation. Grandiose tom rolls bring the immensely cheery lead on ""Same Road"" crashing through stained-glass windows, working in a classic Guido lineage that feels like a familiar hand on your shoulder. It shares a dainty atmosphere with the germane standout ""Kalm"", a billowy number that melds a gooey centre with hobbling, plucked strings that leave delicately textured contrails as they fade. It would round proceedings off tastefully, but the serenity is allowed no time to manifest before the thick, adventurous ""Squeaky Jungle"" storms through. It's a decent track in its own right, but a perplexing choice to close the album out.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Nothing on <i>Moods of Future Joy</i> is overtly bad, but there's scant to get especially excited about. Guido is still an adept producer with a canny knack for a pleasing melody, but treads water far more than he should. On <i>Moods Of Future Joy </i>he settles for a middle ground, diluting a winning formula. In doing so, he repositions the remaining streaks of brilliance as frustratingly slippery.</p></div>"|18795.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18795-guido-moods-of-future-joy/|6.3|Gabriel Szatan

She's easily the label's most surprising addition yet, though her smoky atmospherics are of the mood music variety preferred by many of the crew. A member of downtempo trio Jahcoozi (alongside producers Robot Koch and Oren Gerlitz), you might otherwise recognize her sultry tones from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2978-modeselektor/"" target=""_blank"">Modeselektor</a>'s ""Silikon,"" back when she went by given name Sasha Perera. But on <i>Everlast</i>, her solo debut, she mostly abandons the smooth electronica of her past in favour of a gothic atmosphere that actually kind of sounds like it was recorded in a frigid castle, her vocals echoing through chambers of cold stone.<br/></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Perera has the kind of breathy, sighing tone that complements well-groomed, trip-hoppy electronic music—the kind you'd expect to hear in the background at a public place, unobtrusive and pleasing to the ear. But laid naked on <i>Everlast,</i> there's a spooky and beguiling quality to it. The album opens with the bluesy strum of ""Drunk Man"", where her vocals are appropriately slurred so you can just barely make out the words. Her quiet voice is accompanied by steady drums and a distinctly wooden thump of a bassline—earthy sounds with sanguine accents that feel like a deliberate reaction to the perfect production of her other work. It's not very often you hear of an expat in Berlin who tries so hard to sound acoustic.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Not that the production is an afterthought; every element is touched with some level of reverb and so neatly placed that you'll wonder which are judiciously-chosen samples, and which were actually played by hand. Hard-panned multitracking and other stereo spectrum tricks makes the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28603-gonjasufi/"" target=""_blank"">Gonjasufi</a> duet ""Giddy"" captivating in spite of its stupor, and pitch-shifting on ""Shady"" lends it an ethereal feel underpinned by implacable noises that sound like guitar strings being melted and stretched like taffy. She even plays off a  ghostly, masculine version of herself on ""Carousel,"" whose simple chorus echoes the bare desperation of Neil Young's Ditch Trilogy—it's amazing the amount of emotional mileage she can get out of merely repeating and enunciating a single word, especially when she's doing it over guitar chords that drip with anguish.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Indeed, as thoughtful as the production on <i>Everlast</i> might be, it's simplicity that's key. Album highlight ""Dreamt That Dream"" isn't much more than a few mantra-like phrases stuck together and rolled off Perera's tongue almost carelessly, but it proves intoxicating in the album's walk-in freezer of an echo chamber. It works the same magic on the heavy-handed political didactic (and first single) ""Bizarre"". Her lyrics (""money's running everything/ the same ten families that run the show/ friends with the president and friends with the Pope"") amount to high-school-level social commentary, but set against a distant synth whine and decisive acoustic guitar, it's like a 60s protest song dressed up in modern clothes. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Most of all, Perera Elsewhere’s debut is a defiantly quiet record in a scene of maximalism; compare it to the oversaturated landscapes of her labelmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28501-shlohmo/"" target=""_blank"">Shlohmo</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30635-suicide-mission-ft-baths/"" target=""_blank"">Groundislava</a>, or the rhythmic attack of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29376-salva/"" target=""_blank"">Salva</a>, and she's an obvious outlier. But not <i>that</i> much of an outlier; Friends Of Friends has always had a knack for finding artists whose sense of pathos borders on maudlin but usually end up on the right side of the divide. The same goes for <i>Everlast</i>, where even the most earnest moments, like the baroque ""Light Bulb"" or the self-consciously trippy ""Bongoloid"", become captivating thanks to her unforgettable voice and cultivated ethereality. It’s a short but penetrating record of far-away, foggy reveries that’ll burrow its way into your consciousness until it haunts you, one breath after another.</span></p></div>"|18618.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18618-perera-elsewhere-everlast/|7.8|Andrew Ryce

""What's the one I need?"" I will ask, seeking to get a hold of a discography as pervasive as mist. ""Oh, they're <i>all</i> good,"" comes the too-often, earnest reply, as my heart sinks. They're <i>all</i> good? That's not an answer; that's a ""Keep Out"" sign. There are mediocre Beatles LPs, unnecessary Miles Davis records, lesser works by Mozart and Beethoven. How can they <i>all</i> be good?</p>
<p>For their devoted followers, though, Thee Oh Sees have become the only band they'll ever need. This is a tremendous achievement, requiring a demented level of commitment, both to a glass-eating touring and release schedule and to a narrow aesthetic. Dwyer's got both, in spades, and it has brought him to where he is now: ""It took me 35 years, but I was able to make art for a living,"" he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/5-10-15-20/8895-thee-oh-sees-john-dwyer/"">told Evan Minsker</a> in 2012. The <i>Singles Collections</i> are a periodic Hoover vac-ing of the couch-cushion change that tumbles from view during John Dwyer's frantic music dispersal, but they are also a service to people on the sidelines like us. They make an excellent tasting-platter way to engage with a band that usually demands steak-for-two (for one) levels of commitment.</p>
<p>If you can make generalizations about John Dwyer's output with Thee Oh Sees, it's that he likes the sound of bad feelings, cheerfully expressed, and he's drawn to explore the spot where vamps harden into palsies. You can hear both of these preoccupations at work in the ten songs here (plus one live cut), collected from Flexi discs, split 7""s, artist compilations, and elsewhere. A few of the songs on this collection are recognizably ""singles"" in tone and form— ""Ugly Man,"" ""Wait Let's Go,"" ""Always Flying,"" ""Devil Again"" all have at least three chords, run four minutes or less, and have ""ba-ba-ba"" choruses. But most of them head directly into that kinked-up corner of the song that repeatedly pulls at Dwyer's imagination, the spot where the song's narrative action swings shut and the groove hinges open.</p>
<p>The vamp is where the action is for Dwyer, and Thee Oh Sees have as many different ways to vamp as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National</a> have to sound regal, as Richard Pryor had to say ""motherfucker."" ""What You Need"" is jerky and brittle, evoking the neural-damage sense of ""rocking."" ""Burning Spear"" creaks and protests like a rusty mattress coil. ""FB12"" rides a repeating bass-note octave like a low-grade migraine. The vamp is Dwyer personified: A mixture of mania and stasis, a way of pacing while standing still. For Dwyer, it's a reason for living.</p>
<p>It's also a template: If you are given to maintaining a breakneck and frankly absurd creative clip, keeping a mental catalog of vamps proves handy—a few of the biggest, boldest lines are already down when you start working. The album concludes with two ten minute pieces—""Block Of Ice (Live at the SF Eagle)"" and a live version of ""Destroyed Fortress"" from 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12981-help/"" target=""_blank"">Help</a>—</i>that boil Thee Oh Sees all the way down to their purest essence. The drums thump a back beat with the determination of a toddler wielding a toy hammer, the bass line jigs in place, and Dwyer rips open his guitar to the skies. The idea of ""song"" disintegrates, and the long straight line of the vamp takes over. For him and for his faithful, it's a gathering place. </p></div>"|18783.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18783-thee-oh-sees-singles-collection-volume-three/|7.8|Jayson Greene

Formulating a signature musical language is especially impressive within the abstracted terrain of ambient drone and wordless dream-pop, where they've each made some of the most distinctive sounds of the past decade. Harris, with her analog and oft-depressed toolbox of charcoal drones, acoustic strums, and ethereal singing, has arguably been the most prominent artist working in this realm. But Cantu-Ledesma, also of San Francisco post-rock band Tarentel since the 1990s, is a fixture in his own right, having delivered around two-dozen releases for labels like Type, Blackest Rainbow, and his own, Root Strata. Cantu-Ledesma's drones are dense, bright, and harsh, most cohesively captured on 2010's compulsively listenable <i>Love Is a Stream</i>—a properly mesmeric attempt at teasing the ecstatic essence from <i>Loveless</i>-style shoegaze noise, amping his deconstructions into the red while capturing the blissed out totality of real love.</p>
<p><i>Event of Your Leaving</i>, a project in-process for at least two years, proves just how complementary these seemingly conflicted aesthetic spirits can be. Where Harris makes subtle, interior, and dread-laced music that often sounds buried underground—it can feel embedded with existential questions of mortality and death, and did so explicitly on this year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17571-the-man-who-died-in-his-boat-dragging-a-dead-deer-up-a-hill/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Man Who Died in His Boat</i></a>—Cantu-Ledesma makes blown-out, skybent music, with the affect of something heavenly pouring down. Where Grouper works with images of the natural world and somber moods, Cantu-Ledesma's beaming washes of pastel-shaded white noise are optimistic; his song titles have included ""White Dwarf Butterfly"" and ""Stained Glass Body"", carrying the romance of a love poem or emergency meditation. Grouper's music can recall the tapestry of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/302-william-basinski/"" target=""_blank"">William Basinski</a>'s decaying tape loops, but Cantu-Ledesma's radiates as if possessing regenerative power. If Grouper is the inexplicable feeling just after loss, Cantu-Ledesma's is recovery. Both produce emotionally overwhelming drone abstractions with unconventional beauty. They use idiosyncratic tones to articulate things that are unspeakable.</p>
<p>This duality is absolutely crushing on Side A. Cantu-Ledesma's blistering noise allows crevices of space to fill in and contribute a certain brightness and color, as if poking holes so that rays can shine through, while Harris' drones ground the sound. It is damaged and euphoric, and often sounds as if there is a steady wind churning through while the sun beams down, capped with the somewhat confounding angelic or supernatural aura that is quintessential of Grouper. The repetition of 13-minute opener ""In Stellar Orbit"" is like a massage for your brain cells—the gentle, circling abrasion underpinned by light and occasionally skull-piercing noise, gorgeous and grating as it floats off. ""Blood Moon"" is the energetic epitome of the project, reaching the record's visceral peak while simultaneously managing to amp its grace. The defining characteristics of Cantu-Ledesma's sound are here, coupled with layered drones that could be a distant choir. </p>
<p>A noticeable sadness marks <i>Event of Your Leaving</i>'s second side. The cinematic title track is the record's shortest, and seems to function like an overture. The light is drained as a swell of downcast drones are marked by minor piano keys and oscillated vocal parts that recall Grouper's earlier records. The flecks of piano are brighter on ""In Held Company"" and there are sublime negotiations throughout, between the severity of the austere instrumentation and featherlight vocals—and later, between the track's considerable white space and a soliloquy of drone. An anxious, distressing rumble permeates the record as it closes, and though the album imposes no narrative, there is an undeniable trajectory from innate hope to total loss of vitality. <i>Event</i> shows this process with no resolution, just honest closure fading into silence.</p></div>"|18784.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18784-raum-event-of-your-leaving/|7.9|Jenn Pelly

This makes a Shearwater covers album an intriguing proposition and also a risky one: can anyone else’s songwriting survive in these conditions? So it’s even more interesting that this collection is called <i>Fellow Travelers</i>; sure, it’s taken from Trotsky, but all the same, it lets you know who Shearwater see as not only their role models, but also their peers. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"">Coldplay</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"">St. Vincent</a>? Sure. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4683-xiu-xiu"">Xiu Xiu</a>? Well, Meiburg has collaborated with Jamie Stewart in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14701-blue-water-white-death/"" target=""_blank"">Blue Water White Death</a>. Folk Implosion? <i>Um</i>.</p>
<p>But any discussion of <i>Fellow Travelers</i> needs to begin with “I Luv The Valley OH!” It’s not only the definitive Xiu Xiu because it’s the best song Jamie Stewart has written. It’s also a song that couldn’t be written or <i>performed</i> by anyone besides Jamie Stewart, at least not effectively. Even beyond the music itself, a perverse mocking of glimmering, hopeful alt-rock, the vocals are <i>sui generis</i> Xiu Xiu where you can’t tell if it’s a legitimate cry for help or Stewart prank calling the suicide hotline. If you don’t have his track record, it’s a lot tougher to pull off lines like “there’s a razor, make a million billion threats” and “my behind is a beehive/ there's a buzz in my backside,” while slipping into incorrect French. Shearwater’s take is over-the-top in its own way—it just turns “I Luv The Valley OH!” into a goddamn stadium anthem with swooping bass and a constant, reverbed kick drum replacing the erratic, mortar rounds that punctuated the original. Sheared and watered down, the palpable danger of Stewart’s performance is replaced with cocksure pomp—while the exclamatory cry of the title in the original is one of the most harrowing, cathartic yells ever caught on tape, Meiburg’s haughty, oratorial style makes it sound like high school Shakespeare or just any old “oh”. I think Meiburg’s heart is in the right place here, but you take Jamie Stewart out of “I Luv The Valley OH!” and you’re just left with a song that has a nice melody.</p>
<p>As it turns out, Shearwater can somehow take the edge off a Coldplay song as well. “Hurts Like Heaven” was indicative of Coldplay’s pure-pop ambitions on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15953-mylo-xyloto/""><i>Mylo Xyloto</i></a>, giving Chris Martin’s vocals Autotune tweaks and the rhythm section a blinding sheen. Here, it’s a pretty, weightless piano ballad that’s closer to the stereotyped ""Coldplay"" <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwhhNgjxkp8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that gets played for cheap laughs in major motion pictures</a>. On the other hand, St. Vincent’s “Cheerleader” and Folk Implosion’s “Natural One” are given straight, respectful covers, but once again make a great case for the necessity of character. “Cheerleader” loses its lyrical bite without the context Annie Clark had created throughout her body of work, and while “Natural One” was included in the most <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113540/soundtrack"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">absurdly grim movie about teenage sex ever made</a>, Lou Barlow managed to capture the occasional fumbling and pure lust behind it all. A key line is “when mama’s not around, there’s no telling what we’ll do when we’re free.” Meiburg’s imperious vocals can evoke the mating rituals of majestic condors, but not that.</p>
<p>When Shearwater don’t have to compete with an original's familiarity or strong personality, <i>Fellow Travelers </i>succeeds by doing a service for overlooked artists. In its original form, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/624-david-thomas-broughton/"">David Thomas Broughton</a>’s “Ambiguity” was the sort of thing that typically becomes an artist-beloved lost treasure, a gut-wrenching sentiment wrapped up in a six-minute, static-laced avant-folk song. It benefits from Shearwater’s immaculate, harp-led arrangement, which foregrounds the melody and lyrics. The same goes for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/291-baptist-generals"">Baptist Generals</a>’ “Fucked Up Life”; Shearwater’s fellow Dentonites list a litany of relatable punishments and while it’s not that far off in subject matter from  “I Luv The Valley OH!”, Meiburg’s performance is much more suited to the source material.</p>
<p>Most revelatory of all is “Tomorrow”. It was the second single from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/779-clinic"">Clinic</a>’s 2008 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11335-do-it/""><i>Do It!</i></a>, which found the band well into a stage of their career that Shearwater is just entering: where you’re perceived to have a “thing” and that thing is kinda taken for granted. If you didn’t recognize “Tomorrow”, it’s much easier to spot its Clinic tics after the fact—the circular bassline, the pinch melody. The cover here gives a mutual benefit, opening up Shearwater’s sound in subtle ways while putting a focus on Ade Blackburn’s actual songwriting acumen, which is rarely given a close reading.</p>
<p>Shearwater never sound like a band that does things for the hell of it, though you can understand how they’d benefit from <i>Fellow Travelers</i> regardless of the outcome. Last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16277-animal-joy/""><i>Animal Joy</i></a> showed a band trying to let loose, just a little, even if they can’t truly sound like anyone else as long as Meiburg is at the lead. But it did at least show the group <i>trying</i> to rock, <i>trying</i> to groove. <i>Fellow Travelers</i> can be seen as Shearwater showing their scratch work, and while great cover albums can be a revelation or an embarrassment, most end up right around here: which is to say, admirable and flawed. Few things can be tougher for an artist than to purely express themselves. Expressing what they like about another artist is often one of them.</p></div>"|18785.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18785-shearwater-fellow-travelers/|5.8|Ian Cohen

Playing in Beachwood Sparks was a means of “shaking loose the indie rock shackles,” writes Rademaker in the liners to </span><i>Desert Skies</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, which the band recorded in 1997 as its debut but is only now getting around to releasing. Theirs was a very calculated and deliberate move to West Coast country pop; trading </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"">Dinosaur Jr</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> for the International Submarine Band and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2655-stephen-malkmus/"">Stephen Malkmus</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> for Gene Clark was an emancipation of sorts from the strictures of indie-rock distortion and obscurity. Their music featured pedal steel and peaceful easy choruses, not to mention vintage western shirts, rodeo denim, and well-worn Wallabees.</span></p>
<p>These five dudes—along with percussionist Pete “Sleigher” Kinne—embraced both the music and the lifestyle with the fervency of acolytes. They were not only defining themselves, but also defining in even more emphatic terms what they were not. Beachwood Sparks was not another indie rock band. They had something like a mission, and it went well beyond, as Rademaker writes, “to get high and play music; and to get high and listen to music.” They were reviving Los Angeles as a rock-and-roll town, shifting the focus from post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3954-stone-temple-pilots/"">STP</a> trend jumpers to a scene rooted in the region’s pop history. Whatever subversive quality that goal might have possessed in 1997 is lost in 2013—not only because L.A. has a pretty bustling indie scene but also because the Beachwoods has seemingly sparked so many other acts, some <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5653-fleet-foxes/"">great</a>, others <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6549-the-donkeys/"">not so much</a>. Cosmic American music has never sounded quite so earthbound as it does this far into the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>At the tail end of the twentieth, however, the members of Beachwood Sparks were only just learning the language of West Coast country pop. Steeping themselves in <a href=""Gram%20Parsons"">Gram Parsons</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22337-buffalo-springfield/"">Buffalo Springfield</a>, and <i>Bradley’s Barn</i>-era Beau Brummels, they had not yet figured out how to put their own stamp on the music, or even what they’re stamp would sound like. Instead, at this stage they were primarily mimics, more intent on re-creating a particular sound than on putting it toward sturdy songs. On “Make It Together"", the theremin sounds like it has quote marks and a footnote attribution to “Good Vibrations.” Dutifully, the guitars chime and riff like the <a href=""Byrds"">Byrds</a>; the voices harmonize like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14474-crosby-stills-and-nash/"">CSN&amp;Y</a>. Only on the four relatively lo-fi bonus tracks does the music retain any real urgency or revel in its rough edges.</p>
<p>On the other hand, should we expect anything more than that from any band at this stage in its development? There is something commendable about the rambunctious energy they bring to the title track and the reasonably spacey “Canyon Ride”, even if it’s routinely undermined by the retreating vocals and their crate-digger reverence. Despite their L.A. origins, Beachwood Sparks isn’t a troupe of actors staging a period piece. They’re trying to revive this style of music, to prove it can say as much in 1997 as it did in 1970. Opinions vary as to whether or not the band ever managed to make this sunbaked sound their own. Sixteen years after these initial sessions—ten of which they spent on hiatus—they remain a surprisingly divisive band, with detractors accusing them of imitating rather than innovating. <i>Desert Skies</i> does absolutely nothing to answer that criticism, but it does provide a useful point against which to measure their later efforts. Compare this release to last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16755-the-tarnished-gold/""><i>The Tarnished Gold</i></a>, which was heavy with comedown melancholy, and it’s not hard at all to see how far they’ve come. </p></div>"|18758.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18758-beachwood-sparks-desert-skies/|5.0|Stephen M.

The Brooklyn-based duo of Lauren Dillard and Lauren Flax showed promise with their 2010 single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/40884-listen-creep-with-the-xxs-romy-madley-croft/"">""Days""</a>, only to find their momentum diluted by a <a href=""http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2010/10/the_horrifyingl.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">minor controversy</a> and an affiliation with a fly-by-night <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_house_(music_genre)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">genre</a>. That song was a joint effort with Romy Madley Croft from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"">the xx</a>, who was the first in a string of collaborators to come on board with Dillard and Flax to help flesh out the band's sound. CREEP have surfaced intermittently over the last three years, often as remixers, but also with occasional advances on their own take on trip-hop. Some of the artists they helped remix come on board as collaborators here (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4850-planningtorock/"">Planningtorock</a>, Alejandra Deheza of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7374-school-of-seven-bells/"">School of Seven Bells</a>), on an oft-delayed album that plunges into the darkness and never looks back, pulling in a mix of old and new tracks on the way down.</p>
<p>If nothing else, <i>Echoes</i> is a timely release, coming at a point when artists such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30594-arca/"">Arca</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"">FKA twigs</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30186-dropxlife/"">DropxLife</a> are developing a potent strain of 21st century trip-hop. Where those artists take the genre as a starting point, CREEP remain fully immersed in the sound, siphoning off some of its dingiest moments as a primal source. As such, <i>Echoes</i> is more <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Massive+Attack/Mezzanine"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Mezzanine</i></a> than <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Massive+Attack/Blue+Lines"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Blue Lines</i></a>, recalling the point where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"">Massive Attack</a> sucked any remnants of optimism out of their sound. For a collection of tracks culled from such a long period of time, and with a different guest vocalist on each, it's a surprisingly coherent and linear album. ""Days"" doesn't sound out of place from (presumably) more recent recordings, such as the mournful ""Vertigo"", which features the welcome return of <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Lamb"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lamb</a> singer Lou Rhodes.</p>
<p>In among the shade there's a sense of drama forcing through the fog, with most tracks shaped by sparse arrangements and echo-y vocals. It has the unfortunate effect of making CREEP sound like they're trying too hard to make a bold statement with every turn they take, perpetually searching for a spine-chilling moment that's just beyond their reach. Mostly the execution is lacking—the beats on ""Empty Church"" are ghostly thin, the synths on ""Jessica King"" are set to the ""plume of smoke"" preset for the nth time, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4058-sia/"">Sia</a>-featuring ""Dim the Lights"" rubs stodgy strings up against a too-predictable music box sound. The guest vocalists occasionally shine despite their surroundings. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4285-tricky/"">Tricky</a>'s turn on ""Call Her"" is particularly notable, reaching whispery <i>Maxinquaye</i> peaks while Deheza works up perfectly floaty harmonies behind him.</p>
<p>What binds the original trip-hop artists, who were reluctant (to say the least) to be grouped together under the banner, was a sense of people digging deep into introspection, often reaching a point that was uncomfortably personal. There was a grit to what they were doing, a sense of beats that had been labored over for months, of samples that had been endlessly tweaked through the night. <i>Echoes</i>, despite its long gestational period, resembles the work of a couple of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Twin Peaks"" </a>freaks playing trip-hop dress up, even going so far as to channel David Lynch collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29150-julee-cruise/"">Julee Cruise</a> on ""The Key"". Their best moment is still the skittering ""Days"", but sticking a song from 2010 on an album from 2013 feels like the actions of a band who are coming up short of ideas on how to move forward.</p></div>"|18759.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18759-creep-echoes/|6.0|Nick Neyland

As details slowly congealed leading up to the release of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30273-rhye/"" target=""_blank"">Rhye</a>’s excellent debut album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17693-rhye-woman/"" target=""_blank""><i>Woman</i></a> this past March, many listeners were introduced to Michael Milosh, the man—and yes, many were reluctant to believe, that’s totally a dude—who was effortlessly braiding his voice through Robin Hannibal’s silky tracks. Milosh has been producing and releasing his own music for nearly a decade via L.A.’s Plug Research, a label with an aesthetic of high-polish adult contempo grooves personified by the Toronto transplant. That same voice is in peak form on <i>Jetlag</i>, but if you discovered Milosh via Rhye, don’t expect to hear it surrounded by the same kind of sultry soul. Left to his own devices, Milosh prefers chillier confines.</p>
<p>First, a word on that voice, which—stay with me here—reminds me of no less than Michael McDonald, in a specific and positive way. The two evoke different types of soul—McDonald’s furry baritone is a simulacrum of church-trained 60s and 70s belters while Milosh’s lithe countertenor owes much more to the hushed tones of Quiet Storm legends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade/"" target=""_blank"">Sade</a> and Anita Baker—but they’re equally transfixing, in a way that suggests an uncannily human android programmed to the “soul” setting. Each voice doesn’t sound like the product of training as much as something that automatically emanated the first time they set themselves to try and sing. Much in the same manner that McDonald manifested his alien instrument as a radiant background production cog on Steely Dan’s <a href=""http://youtu.be/waIBA6_0GQc?t=6m19s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">infinitely layered productions</a><i>, </i>Milosh prefers to highlight the otherworldly affects of his voice. At several points on <i>Jetlag</i>, he ceases singing words and simply weaves his wordless croon amidst the other ProTool layers, creating the sensation that you’re driving past his voice as it sits on the side of a highway at night. Milosh’s skill in twisting and stretching his voice is his greatest gift as an artist. The way he and Hannibal gently interweave layers of these feather-light sighs at the start of “Major Minor Love"", for instance, is a highlight of the Rhye LP. </p>
<p>Milosh’s crisp electronic soundscapes work mainly as contrast, immaculate bedding designed to melt away as his warm voice slithers in. At his best on <i>Jetlag</i>, Milosh builds up his tracks in the simple interest of pulling them back to let the vocal take over. The first minute of “Hear in You” is a perfect example of this. The first minute of the song is pieced together from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2229-junior-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Junior Boys</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/195-apparat/"" target=""_blank"">Apparat</a> template of chilly electro-pop, but merely serves as walk-on music for the dramatic reveal of the track’s simple hook, on which Milosh stretches a syllable—the “ohhh” at the end of “know”—at just the right time, for just the right duration, and repeats it over and over. The effect is a specific kind of listening pleasure, of the late-90s/early 2000s post-Portishead/Massive Attack moment, when groups like Zero 7 and Morcheeba boiled off trip-hop’s sense of danger, leaving it with a glut of sticky mood. When songs from that “chillout” moment of electro-R&amp;B are done well—like Zero 7’s shimmering “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INn1C6ImJKg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Destiny</a>,” say—they nail a perfect middleground between passion and propriety. “Hear in You” finds itself in that orbit, as does “Don’t Call It”, on which Milosh dips into his more gutsy lower register amidst what sounds like an adult-contempo remake of Radiohead’s <i>Amnesiac</i>.</p>
<p>The passion and yearning of “Destiny” was of a particular sort, Sia Furler opening the song by admitting to watching porn in her hotel dressing gown. This style of longing for human contact to counteract the cold, sterilized distance of travel is all over <i>Jetlag</i>, recalling another turn-of-the-century groove-based album: Thievery Corporation’s <i>The Mirror Conspiracy</i>, a cosmopolitan soundtrack for a specific kind of jetsetting rich guy—“<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYv2PhG89A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Smooth Operator</a>”s trust-funded step-son. <i>Jetlag </i>draws from this DNA, though Milosh evokes a starker, more purposefully mundane scenario: a design firm executive coldly shuffling a leatherbound portfolio through people movers in stark-white airports, and glassily staring into the near distance. It’s impossible for Milosh’s voice not to signify desire, and <i>Jetlag</i> is an album on which the glow of intimate passions arises from immaculate interior design.</p></div>"|18761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18761-milosh-jetlag/|6.0|Eric Harvey

Throughout his career as a band member and solo artist, but especially on his new album <i>Don’t Tell the Driver, </i>the Australian guitarist favors listing rhythms and loose meters that suggest unrehearsed spontaneity but also tribulation, peril, even a touch of seasickness. “All Gone"", which opens <i>Driver,</i> builds from a hard rustle of drums and shakers, then adds a scrambling guitar riff that sounds like it’s trying to shake itself free of the undertow. It’s a compact, concise musical drama, impressionistic in its action yet specific in its desperate, determined mood. It’s not difficult to imagine the story, such as it is, unfolding within the frame of the seaside landscape on the album cover, which Turner himself painted.</p>
<p>Best known as one third of the Melbourne-based instrumental band the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1089-dirty-three/"">Dirty Three</a>, Turner also has also hired out (with Dirty drummer Jim White) as a backing band for such artists as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"">Cat Power</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3003-nina-nastasia/"">Nina Nastasia</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"">Nick Cave</a>. Over the course of a twenty-five-year career, he has learned to strike a very careful balance: On one hand, he has developed a distinctive playing style, one that draws from a range of styles, yet he can become dutifully invisible behind a charismatic vocalist or lead instrumentalist. As a solo artist, he proceeds slowly but not hesitantly; <i>Don’t Tell the Driver</i> is his first in six years. In between projects, he worked on these songs for about four years, recording in fits and starts at Big Moth Studio in Melbourne. Yet the album never sounds labored or unfocused.</p>
<p>Turner has hinted, perhaps in jest, that <i>Don’t Tell the Driver</i> is intended to be a “post-rock opera,” which is way too much clever concept than the music can shoulder. Its emotional palette is too subdued to be described as operatic, and if there’s any narrative stretching between these eleven songs, it’s implied rather than stated, conveyed through that musical lurch than through the usual plot points and sung exposition. <i>Driver</i> is, however, his most vocally oriented solo album to date, featuring Melbourne-based musician and visual artist Caroline Kennedy-McCracken on nearly half the songs. Even as she settles into the protagonist role, her voice proves far more interesting as a musical instrument than as a device to convey lyrical meaning. On “Here’s a Way”, she toggles between a traditionally melodic verse and a chorus bends her syllables and dissolves them into the hums and moans of the music, creating a starkly dreamy contrast. On the title track, however, Kennedy-McCracken breaks the words down to their barest syllables and sustains her notes steadily, mimicking the straight brushstrokes of the horns to suggest a moment of calm amid the storm of music.</p>
<p>Thanks to the presence of McCracken and classical vocalist Oliver Mann, who sounds like Neptune himself on “Over Waves"", it’s easy to forget that <i>Driver </i>is a guitar player’s album. Turner often takes lead, but just as often he hangs back in the tangle of music. His playing is subtle and varied, ranging from pensive electric notes to knotted acoustic rhythms. The aptly titled “The Last Song” builds patiently to a series of crests and troughs, pitting Turner’s shimmery guitar against Ian Wadley’s frayed snare rhythms, yet the mood is not triumphant or climactic but reflective. In fact, the song seems to fall apart in the process of playing it. Perhaps that what Turner means when he calls <i>Driver</i> a post-rock opera, yet overall it plays as something much less ambitious yet much more useful to a listener. It’s a fluidly cohesive album that develops its music themes—that nautical lurch, that calming lull—over eleven carefully yet imaginatively arranged songs. </p></div>"|18695.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18695-mick-turner-dont-tell-the-driver/|7.8|Stephen M.

If you’re familiar with the Fullerton, Calif., garage-rock stronghold, pretend you aren’t and put yourself in the position of a person who only knows that the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30203-gap-dream/"">Gap Dream</a> frontman is living inside of a record store that also happens to be his label's office. And not even one of those 90s mega-chains like Tower or Sam Goody that could pass for a luxury apartment. It’s not even Amoeba. It’s the kind of place that tends to thrive in the current economy, a nationally recognized local joint that caters to a faithful and specific demographic. But consider the logistics: does a Burger Records patron that’s just looking for an Unkle Funkle cassette run the risk of bumping into a shirtless, hungover Fulvimar if he happened to have a long night? Does he have a security deposit? Are you liable to find an opened box of Cookie Crisp in the vinyl section?</p>
<p>Jokes aside, Fulvimar’s current home address is the first step in establishing a narrative that steers you towards an optimal conclusion: the guy literally lives inside of a record collection! And it’s true, his new LP <i>Shine Your Light</i> does span the gamut of styles you’d expect from a “record store guy”, i.e., Beach Boys, Eno, Can, Velvet Underground, and tons of forgotten bands that were influenced by them. More importantly, you get the sense of what kind of guy would actually go through the hassle of living in such a place, as <i>Shine Your Light</i> aligns Fulvimar’s musical ambitions with a total lack of <i>personal</i> ambitions, doling out endearing songs about arrested development and short-term solutions that end up causing more problems in the long run.</p>
<p>As with Burger alums <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29648-king-tuff"">King Tuff</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall"">Ty Segall</a>, you can apply the general tag of “loner power-pop” to Gap Dream, though unlike the aforementioned, it’s Fulvimar’s main thing rather than an aspect of his overall M.O. You can sense his ear for the canon: the unwholesome “Love Is Not Allowed” perverts the preciousness of round-like harmonizing in the style of <i>Here Come the Warm Jets</i>, the more rhythm-focused tracks make lo-fi approximations of T. Rex’s pretty vacancy, and you can hear a fake-it-til-you-make-it Kinks homage on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15934-gap-dream-shine-your-love/"">“Shine Your Love”</a>, where a regal horn chart is hilariously impersonated by MS-DOS synths more suited for <i>King’s Quest</i>. But for the most part, he’s more of a melody-first guy who demonstrates ingenuity over innovation and you never lose sight of how low the stakes are. The tools are crude and minimal—vintage drum machines, even more vintage keyboards, and underlying fuzz-rock guitars that put him well within Burger’s wheelhouse (or, garage).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, though <i>Shine Your Light </i>was inspired by Fulvimar leaving a go-nowhere life in Ohio after receiving an invitation to hole up in Fullerton, well...he’s arrived and “go-nowhere” means something a bit different. Judging from the majority of the lyrics, it appears that just about any personal intrusion or interaction with the outside world is too much for him to handle and he’d rather kick it alone. A new pair of boots gets Fulvimar in the mood to strut a little on “Fantastic Sam”, which is still presumably named after the sub-Supercuts hair salon chain. One song later, he admits on “Immediate Life Sentence” to getting out of the house for no other reason than to move his feet. He spends the rest of it haranguing a woman who tries to socialize him, snarling “you’re the kind of girl that wants to kill all my time,” even if the petulant tone makes him sounds like a guy who’s an expert time assassin. Note how the cruelest indignity is paying $7 for a beer, at which point Fulvimar vows “I don’t need to get laid that bad/ I’ll just stay home and get high.” Two songs later on “Shine Your Love”, that misanthropy has metastasized into full-blown nihilism—his voice curdles into a bratty snarl of “there is no past and there is no future,” and he proceeds to get blotto on a bottle of gin that itself probably cost $7.</p>
<p>More life-reflecting than life-altering stuff for sure, but the approachability (if not admirability) of Fulvimar’s P.O.V. establishes a personality that serves as a hook when the songs themselves don’t do much to distinguish themselves. <i>Shine Your Light</i> never gets oppressive, though during its final third, it does suggest what living in a record store might be like after the novelty wears out—kinda lonely, a little bit stuffy, and leaving you subject to others trying to tiptoe around, “you’re gonna move out eventually...right?” That remains to be seen, but for the time being, Gap Dream is Fulvimar’s means of  “trying to find a chill spot just to organize my mind.” The song from whence it came is, naturally enough, “Chill Spot”. Consider it his way of saying “mi casa es su casa.”</p></div>"|18729.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18729-gap-dream-shine-your-light/|6.7|Ian Cohen

Nick Weiss and Logan Takahashi's subsequent successes, from an irreverently dance-y <a href=""http://www.earmilk.com/2010/07/13/teengirl-fantasy-cd-r/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2009 CD-R</a> to a couple of solid full-length releases, can be largely attributed to this ability. Their records—including the foggy 2010 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14635-7am/"" target=""_blank""><i>7AM</i></a> and 2012's more new age-y <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16939-tracer/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tracer</i></a>, which featured assists from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18661-kelela-cut-4-me/"" target=""_blank"">Kelela</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28822-laurel-halo/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"" target=""_blank"">Laurel Halo</a>—offered glimmers of potential and delivered the occasional standout (three years later, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11950-cheaters/"" target=""_blank"">""Cheaters""</a> is still something to behold), but in 2013, it still feels like they're searching for their own individual sound.</p>
<p>Released in anticipation of their third album, their new EP, <i>Nun</i>, finds them continuing this trend. Using <i>Tracer</i> as something of a launching pad, <i>Nun</i> finds Teengirl brightening familiar color pallettes in more noticeably energetic ways and heading in an even more dance-oriented direction with a look not dissimilar to the aesthetic developed by the UK label Night Slugs.<span> ""Eric"", in particular, is a zippy track with cascading twinkles and manic, breaking drums; it's one of the most futuristic-sounding tracks Teengirl Fantasy have made.</span><i> </i></p>
<p><i>Nun</i> also marks the first time Weiss and Takahashi have put out a release without any vocal contributions. While their integration of the human voice into their aesthetic is one of their stronger suits (see their <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4qgD9fl428"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">re-work of Mariah Carey's ""Touch My Body""</a>), their atmospheric lushness is enough here to stand on its own. <span> The title track</span><span>, for instance, is a fragile-yet-limber piece that, with aqueous bell tones and drainspout plunks, provides a heady but subtle little dancefloor treat.</span></p>
<p>All that said, to call the 13-minute <i>Nun</i> an EP feels a little disingenuous—it's more a double-sided single padded with two toss-offs tagged as ""bonus"" cuts. Those bonuses make for nice daydreams, and are certainly pretty, but they're ultimately inconsequential atmosphere exercises. So, as a band that's built a modest career on ""promise"" as opposed to ""execution,"" it's safe to file <i>Nun</i> under ""for fans only."" But, judging from the proper tracks ""Nun"" and Eric"", it also suggests that, once again, Teengirl Fantasy deserve a bit of space on your radar.</p></div>"|18775.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18775-teengirl-fantasy-nun-ep/|6.7|Zach Kelly

Nocando’s Hellfyre squad includes long time Project Blowed affiliate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/512-busdriver/"" target=""_blank"">Busdriver</a>, Midwest emigre Open Mike Eagle, and newcomer milo alongside a cadre of MCs and producers from in and around Blowed and L.A.’s beat scene. They've connected for <i>Dorner vs. Tookie</i>, the latest in a series of collaborative mixtapes showcasing a groupwide penchant for tongue-in-cheek self-flagellation and confessional storytelling that quite often metes out both at once.</p>
<p>The four MCs at Hellfyre Club’s core are responsible for the bulk of the songs here, and <i>Dorner vs. Tookie</i> is as much a case for their individual talents as their recombinant interplay. Nocando brings the hysterics, Busdriver is the ace technician, Open Mike Eagle’s a whiz with matching easy-going hooks to intimate personal reflection, and milo is the resident free associative poet. Each shines on a solo cut or two, but it’s when they pair up that the mixtape starts to cook. Busdriver and Nocando reunite as Flash Bang Grenada on “Pet Alligators”, which imagines the <i>10 Haters</i> of their 2011 debut multiplied a thousandfold and ticks off the ridiculous ephemera they’d blow their money on if they struck it rich (giraffes, exotic birds, big cats). <i>Dorner vs. Tookie</i> routinely weaponizes rap braggadocio against itself, most snarkily on the Mike Eagle solo cut “Qualifiers”, where the competition is advised: “We the best mostly/ Sometimes the freshest rhymers/ We the tightest kinda/ Respect my qualifiers.”</p>
<p><i>Dorner vs. Tookie</i>’s operative mode is humor, but its darts are often stealthily laced with pathos. “Manchester” bounces a chorus about not being impressed with other rappers’ on-wax grandstanding off of verses from milo and Nocando about maybe not being all that conventionally cool themselves. Mike and Busdriver’s “Degrassi Picture Day (Hellfyre Jackets)” is all about dressing up and feeling fresh... for an elementary school picture day. (“My wallet’s bulging, 25 bucks/ I’m coming home with that envelope from Life Touch!”) At first pass it plays like a send up of swag rap’s gear obsession, but the childhood reminiscences in Mike’s verses are too pure to work in service only to sarcasm. Likewise for “Apologies”, Mike’s interlude of affirmations where his asking penance for minor infractions like copying a buddy’s haircut and holding onto unused beats too long runs both silly and contemplative, a twelve step retribution campaign for tour bus indiscretions.</p>
<p>Hellfyre Club’s songwriting retains fluidity despite the disparate voices at work throughout, but there's still the odd speed bump in the tracklist. Barring the early posse cut “DVT”, the bruisers here can grate. “We On” and “Give a Fuck” both drag the mixtape down around the midsection. Neither’s wound too tight, and purposefully so, but it’s one of few areas on <i>Dorner vs. Tookie</i> where you can feel the crew straining for laughs rather than confidently teasing them out of the listener.</p>
<p>Even so, <i>Dorner vs. Tookie</i> is far less of a bumpy ride than its label comp mixtape format lets on. It owes its cohesion both to the years of experience racked up by Nocando's band of brothers both together and apart and a spate of productions that adorn these offbeat musings in blippy, drippy soundscapes. Hellfyre Club's rappers and producers actually get each other; they're a fully functioning unit, not a dream team of hired guns, and their collaborations carry a spirit of fun and competition borne out of genuine chemistry. It's a lesson to the vanity label curating rapper barons of the era. You can buy your roster, but your money's not guaranteed to make them click.</p></div>"|18738.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18738-hellfyre-club-dorner-vs-tookie/|7.5|Craig Jenkins

And yet, it’s not an exaggeration to say that no one sounds quite like Dan Bejar—in classic sum-is-greater-than-the-parts fashion, he’s emerged over the past 15 years as one of indie-rock’s most unique and idiosyncratic voices, forging an identity so distinct, he’s even spawned <a href=""http://exclaim.ca/News/destroyers_dan_bejar_gets_his_own_online_impersonator"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">doppleg<span id=""docs-internal-guid-4318a8cc-80c0-61ec-9753-f894b105aa94""><span>ä</span></span>ngers</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/ShitDBejarSays"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter lyric generators</a>. His latest release offers further edification, by proving that Bejar's peculiar presence is unmistakble even when he’s singing someone else’s songs in a foreign tongue. </p>
<p><i>Five Spanish Songs</i> is just that, though there’s a more altruistic impetus to this endeavor than that throwaway title would suggest. Traditionally, when Anglo pop acts opt to record in another language, the motivation is usually opportunistic, a calculated attempt to engender goodwill—and, it follows, sell more records—in overseas countries. (“<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVF-WyrwPI8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sie Liebt Dich yeah, yeah, yeah!</a>”) <i>Five Spanish Songs</i> is, likewise, a means to promote an underappreciated artist in an untapped market, but that artist isn’t Bejar: more than try to make Destroyer a star in Spain, the EP serves as a North American introduction to Seville songwriter Antonio Luque, a prolific Gainsbourgian cult-hero whose long-running band <a href=""http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sr._Chinarro"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sr. Chinarro</a> originally recorded the tracks Bejar covers here. </p>
<p>The EP also presents an opportunity for Bejar to celebrate his own Spanish heritage, which has never really factored into his work before (though, given his tendency to overstuff his songs with verbiage to the point of bursting, it makes sense that he'd want to reconnect with a culture where the words for things like “heart,” “nap,” and “thanks” unfurl over multiple syllables). Bejar’s reverence for Luque is evident through his measured, carefully considered diction, which is less flamboyant than it once was, though several degrees warmer than the hushed sing-speak tones heard on 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15034-kaputt/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kaputt</i></a>. But if Bejar is faithful to the originals’ melodic structures (despite boasting a voice that’s naturally higher than Luque’s weathered croon), he takes great liberties with their presentation, dressing up each song in a familiar Bejarian guise.</p>
<p>The beatific opener “Maria de las nieves” is a languid, moonstruck lullaby worthy of <i>Destroyer’s Rubies</i>, while presenting Bejar with a new mysterious female muse to join all the Jackies and Christines that populate his songs. “El rito” is transformed from a breezy folk serenade to a glitter-rock fist-pumper that would be right at home on the New Pornographers’ next tour setlist. And though Bejar closely follows the upward, string-swept arc of Luque’s tense, Tindersticksian turn “Babieca”, the added luster and bluster suggest the after-hours discotheque decadence of <i>Kaputt</i> imported to a yacht race on the Mediterranean. </p>
<p>And yet even in its less flashy gestures—the busker-ready ditty “Del Monton”, and the melancholic acoustic strip-down of the sprightly, Smiths-ian jangle-pop number “Bye Bye”—<i>Five Spanish Songs</i> never feels like an vanity-project indulgence, but rather a clear, concerted effort on Bejar’s part to communicate why Luque’s songs are so special to him. The overall meaning of these tunes may fly over the heads of non-Spanish speakers, but hey, that’s the case with a lot of Bejar’s <i>English</i> songs, and as with those, certain turns of phrase pop up from the conversational crossfire and knock you out with their stunning clarity; at times, it almost feels as if Luque wrote perfect, scene-setting lines like “Si, la fiesta terminó” in anticipation of Bejar’s sardonic delivery. To that end, even if your familiarity with Spanish doesn’t extend beyond reading the menu at your local taco joint, the experience of listening to <i>Five Spanish Songs</i> is really no different than that of any other Destroyer record. </p></div>"|18769.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18769-destroyer-five-spanish-songs/|7.9|Stuart Berman

The chart-topping, synth-heavy pulse that came out of the Twin Cities in the 80s still seems, even to most music fans short of the local veteran scenester, to be an abrupt fluke of auteurist proficiency and creativity, largely credited to the braintrusts of everything-man superstar <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a> and the songwriting/production juggernaut of Jimmy Jam Harris and Terry Lewis. The groups these three names cut their chops with have been hinted at by music historians, and the peers they shared a scene with got some acknowledgment here and there. But little of this information has ever really been put into the wider context of what Minneapolis sounded like before the Minneapolis Sound. How could the scene that gave us <i>1999 </i>and <i>Control </i>have such an underknown history where its pre-eighties R&amp;B roots are concerned?</p>
<p>Thanks to the deep knowledge base and research that went into Numero Group's <i>Purple Snow </i>compilation, it's made clear just why that is—and why, in a fairer world, it shouldn't have been the case. A large metro area split between the rival identies of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, the Twin Cities had plenty of pitfalls for touring bands. It's a long drive to just about everywhere—more than 300 miles to Milwaukee, 400 to Chicago, and 700 to Cincinnati. Staying home, meanwhile, meant a relatively small support group to break bands on a wider scale before they had the buzz to go national. Booking for funk and R&amp;B bands was constrained to a small circuit of clubs, including venues like the Nacirema and the Cozy Bar, that had vanished by the time First Avenue served as the setting for <i>Purple Rain</i>. There weren't any nationally-distributed, Minneapolis-based indie labels that supported the sound on the level of the garage-pop powerhouse of Soma in the 60s or the punk/new wave stronghold of Twin/Tone in the 80s. What few radio stations supported the format were low-wattage and under-the-radar, while the local press was more fixated on finding the next breakthrough folkie to emerge from the campus coffeehouse circuit like Bob Dylan a decade before.</p>
<p>By now, that one Chris Rock joke might be coming to mind—that the only two black people in Minnesota are Prince and (the now late) Kirby Puckett. Which is hyperbole, of course, but not by much. Despite the presence of strong black communities in both Minneapolis and Saint Paul dating back generations, there was still enough of a widespread passive-aggressive animosity from forces outside the community that manifested as a cold shoulder to deeper integration. In 1978, the same year Prince released his debut album <i>For You</i>, Twins owner Calvin Griffith was caught stating that the reason he picked Minnesota as the destination city for the Washington Senators' 1961 relocation was because “we found out you only had 15,000 blacks here.” The music scene wasn't much easier—more than one musician in the liner notes to <i>Purple Snow </i>mentions that groups couldn't get booked unless there were at least a few white faces in the band. Between prejudice, lack of resources, and a geographically isolated and constrained locale, there was only one way a funk scene could thrive in the Twin Cities: people had to stick together and network, even as limited resources meant stiff competition.</p>
<p>For the better part of the 70s, that meant a lot of woodshedding, experimentation, personnel crossover, community outreach, and evolution—but not a signature style. Most of the material on <i>Purple Snow </i>that dates from the early-mid 70s pre-synthesized, pre-disco funk era could come from just about anywhere, so long as that anywhere had a bunch of talented kids who dug Curtis Mayfield and Isaac Hayes. Many of them typically followed those artists' opulent musicianship, albeit with tighter budgets and dimmer spotlights. Haze, a St. Paul band who predated Prince by having some Purple in their identity until they figured the Hendrix estate wouldn't approve, recorded an excellent debut album in 1974. Two cuts from that self-titled LP—the minor-hit ballad “I Do Love My Lady” and the uptempo conga funk of “Waiting for the Moment”—emphasize the close harmonies, purring organ, and swirling, liquid wah-wah guitars that play up their psychedelic-soul bonafides. Prophets of Peace, who did everything they could to land gigs but saw their ambitions thwarted by the Cities' constraints, were a big horn-driven unit in the tradition of War or Mandrill; what the selection “Get On” lacks in deep messaging (“hey everybody, we wanna party/ all night long”) it makes up for in the kind of crowdpleasing tightness and groove that heated every undersized dancefloor it was pointed at.</p>
<p>And then there's the Family—not to be confused with the mid-80s Prince offshoot of the same name that recorded “Nothing Compares 2 U” five years before Sinead did. A tight-knit crew of musicians who changed their name from Black Magic after some interloping Chicagoans (and, more damagingly, the media) mistook their community center homebase for a turf-war locale, the Family—here billed as Music, Love &amp; Funk—contribute a sweaty yet sophisticated Ohio Players-caliber seven-plus-minute jam called “Stone Lover”, recorded in 1976. By then, Spike Moss and the neighborhood resource that was The Way community center had become a nexus for North Minneapolis youth to hone their playing, and the opportunity to record at the legendary Sound 80 studios of <i>Blood on the Tracks </i>fame drew in a grip of local musicians to join the chorus.</p>
<p>One of the voices to jump in on that cut was one Prince Nelson, then a teenager on the verge of dropping his last name as he got his session-rat studies in at Chris Moon's busy Moonsound Studios. And if there's one thing that <i>Purple Snow </i>makes clear, it's that Prince was practically <i>everywhere </i>in the scene during the late 70s, a prodigial player who learned from everybody and subsequently lent his credits to groups like the Lewis Connection (background vocals and guitar on the silky slow jam “Got to Be Something Here”) and 94 East (the pool-party smoothness of “If You See Me"", where his taut chicken-scratch lead guitar riff barely reveals the virtuoso lurking beneath the hired-hand pro). It's a bit odd to hear him primarily in the context of just another piece of a bigger puzzle, even if his burgeoning talent is attested to frequently in the album's liner notes. (A <i>Minnesota Daily </i>quote, inspired by observations of him at work at Moonsound: “He's got his program pretty well worked out and the wheels are in motion... it's only a matter of time.”) But it goes a long way towards explaining just how and why he managed to dominate the Minneapolis scene: not merely with outrageous style, crossover aspirations, or courting controversy, but by working his ass off.</p>
<p>The only artists to rival Prince's proficiency at the time were, of course, Jimmy Harris and Terry Lewis. As inseparable as their identities have become, <i>Purple Snow </i>makes a point of outlining how divergent their parallel paths really were before they joined forces at the turn of the 80s. Harris put drumming first—he did gigs with his father, “Cornbread” Harris, in a jazz trio before he hit his teens. Then he auditioned for a band at age 13 and found himself outclassed behind the kit, so he joined as a keyboard player instead and cut his teeth on an electric piano borrowed from his dad. By high school, Harris' ear for Philly soul and knack for songwriting led him to become the keyboardist, writer and arranger for a group called Mind &amp; Matter. That band's material here is commercial-friendly to a point—Lewis's Gamble/Huff nods are savvy, and catchy as all get-out—but with the circa-1977 equipment at his fingertips, Lewis' budget-minded substitution of synthesizers for string sections is a bit prescient. Sadly, not prescient enough to find an audience—though they more than held their own in warmup gigs for disco-soul bands like Pleasure and Brass Construction.</p>
<p>Terry Lewis was clued in to Harris's talent, but wasn't able to recruit him into the own thing he had going for a while: a Funkadelic-inspired band intially known as Wars of Armageddon before they changed their name to the less-apocalyptic, Donald Byrd-inspired Flyte Tyme. (The photo of this band in full Mothership-stowaway regalia is worth the price of the collection alone.) Flyte Tyme were more defiantly funky than some of the smooth-soul bands they shared the city with, and powerhouse enough to reportedly upstage Prince when he played his first hometown headlining gig at Minneapolis' Capri Theater in February 1979. In the songs included here from a 1979 Flyte Tyme session—“It's the Things That You Do” and “I've Got You on My Mind”—there's a polished yet gutsy momentum that pairs slap bass and synthesizers to evocative (and scene-definingly familiar) effect. Fatefully, one of the band's most crucial components at the time was singer Cynthia Johnson, who boasted the kind of outer-space glamour and Chaka Khan chops that could've made Flyte Tyme huge. But in jumping ship from Flyte Tyme to record the vocals for Lipps. Inc's “Funkytown”—one of the first hits for the Minneapolis Sound and one of the last of the disco era—another identity change for the band was necessary. As fate would have it, Harris's gig with Mind &amp; Matter wasn't panning out, and the side work he was getting in the studio— including playing all the synthesized instruments and drums on Michael A. Dixon &amp; J.O.Y.'s 1980 electro-gospel curiosity “You're All I Need”—wasn't enough. So the man his DJ gig christened Jimmy Jam became Flyte Tyme's second keyboardist. The Flyte was eventually grounded, leaving them as the Time.</p>
<p>With those enduring luminaries at work, it's still worth acknowledging some of the groups that either fell through the cracks or found minor stardom on a modest scale. While the Minneapolis sound comes across on the surface like an <i>e pluribus unum </i>nucleus where everyone eventually benefited from the stratospheric rise of a few, the expectations and associations of being in with Prince and company could wear an artist down. Some defied it, like the velvety quiet storm stylings of Rockie Robbins (“Together”) or the straightforward disco-flavored groove of Band of Thieves veteran guitarist Orville Shannon (“One Life to Live”). Others were drawn into the inner circle, only to be steered towards something they didn't quite fit, like Sue Ann Carwell, a self-proclaimed “little ghetto chick just hanging around town” whose tenuous Prince connections led to a Warner Bros. contract. Her self-titled 1981 debut, produced by Pete Bellotte in a half-assed compromise between Minneapolis and Italo-disco, bricked big-time, while a truer-to-the-style 1982 track, “Should I Or Should I Not"", was shopped around A&amp;Rs to no avail. And while the early works of the more familiar names here are intriguing, there's the feeling that they should've led to more than just famous affiliations. Alexander O'Neal, the charismatic, rangy-voiced post-Johnson frontman for Flyte Tyme until Morris Day replaced him, would notch a string of hits that early indie cuts like the squiggly get-down jams “Borrowed Time” and “Do You Dare” promisingly anticipated while proving that his success as a performer wasn't entirely dependent on Jam/Lewis. And Andre Cymone's minimalist, funky synthpop/new wave concoction “Somebody Said” makes it worth noting that his career encompassed far more than being one of Prince's longest cohorts and playing bass for the Revolution, even if that's how his mid-80s solo albums were pigeonholed.</p>
<p>Then again, few shadows were harder to escape than the one of Minnesota itself. Longtime residents and scenesters might flip through the booklet of <i>Purple Snow </i>and note the way these artists positioned themselves among local landmarks—Prophets of Peace lined up among the lavish foliage of the Como Park Conservatory; 94 East lounging in the shadows of Charles Ginnever's jagged modernist sculpture 'Nautilus' outside the Walker Art Center; Mind &amp; Matter raising disco fingers to the sky perched atop the mushroom-like brutalist platforms of Peavey Plaza. The musicians position themselves like they're unusual presences in these Twin Cities landmarks, even though they're established local artists. Maybe they felt out of place, crowded out, even unwelcome. And whether the emergence of the Minneapolis Sound in the 80s changed all that is still somewhat uncertain; alt-country and bluegrass acts currently overwhelm up-and-coming R&amp;B and hip-hop artists in sheer number and opportunity. But the precedent that <i>Purple Snow </i>traces led to something special: a situation where a core of artists were given an inch and wound up taking a mile—not out of greed, but of necessity.</p></div>"|18658.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18658-purple-snow-forecasting-the-minneapolis-sound/|8.4|Nate Patrin

<p>By a good distance the best song here, “Waking Up Dead”, is the closest Grainger gets to recalling his old band in both content and delivery. Feeling like shit about a busted relationship and knowing you deserve to feel that way was basically <i>You’re a Woman</i>’s emotional baseline and despite its zippy, glossy latter-day <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes"">Strokes</a> facade, “Waking Up Dead” is a domestic drama given a gut-level punch. After another night of getting wasted and forgetting anything he might’ve said, Grainger yelps “I woke up in an empty bed/ you left for work/ I thought you left for good”, and yeah, we’ve all been there. The chorus also boasts an immediate hook, albeit one that starts out strong for its first couple of bars before taking too many indecisive turns. Still, “Waking Up Dead” is the peak of <i>Yours to Discover</i> and the last time it ever bears some resemblance of a relatable human moment. It’s also the second song, and the first is an instrumental “Overture.”</p>
<p>This is problematic since <i>Yours to Discover</i> is an album of presumable love songs. Not only that, there’s more than a few <i>lovemaking</i> songs, which in a roundabout way has the album picking up where DFA 1979 left off. It’s just an alternate reality where “Sexy Results” turns out like Sugar Ray’s “Fly”, a jumping off point rather than the previous album’s total outlier of a closer. Sure, many people love “Sexy Results” (myself included) and DFA 1979 might still be living off some of that <a href=""http://www.splendad.com/ads/show/88-Motorola-Q-Let-me-show-you-how-I-work"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Motorola Q money</a>, but it benefitted greatly from humor (in both the lyrical construct and Simpsons reference) and context within a caustic, self-flagellating record. <i>Yours to Discover</i> has neither qualities aside from a few casual remarks about becoming a greying letch. And as such, all that remains is the smooth talk and the smoother corporate rock sheen. For the latter, don’t think of Toto, but rather latter day <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer"">Weezer</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1544-fountains-of-wayne"">Fountains of Wayne</a>, assembly line pop-rock incapable of inspiring any emotion except for the nagging sense you’re being sold something.</p>
<p>In this event, it’s non-descript civic planning over lukewarm funk on “The Streets Are Still a Mess”, demo-quality disco more akin to the <i>other</i> DFA (“Let’s Move To NYC”) or, most often, Grainger himself (“I Want Sebastien Grainger”). Grainger’s usually selling himself in the figurative sense, as a power-pop craftsman, and some of these songs are actually pretty catchy. But they stick for the wrong reasons, whether it’s an awkward melodic turn or, more often, an unconscionably lazy lyric. Over a dorm-room acoustic strum, “I'm Looking For A Hand” oozes fake strings and even faker sentiments—“How many times have I gone missin’/ looking for a girl in a world of women/ I tell it to you, <i>ma-ha-ha-an</i>/ I’m looking for a <i>ha-ah-ah-and</i>.”</p>
<p><i>Yours to Discover</i> never feels like a dishonest record, just one where it’s incredibly hard to grasp the intentions or ambitions of its creator. Are we to take the title, cover and solo attribution of <i>Yours to Discover </i>as a sign that it's meant to be heard as a transmission from Sebastien Grainger rather than ""Sebastien Grainger's new project""? Or, does the plasticine production and rigid verse-chorus structure of these songs give you a sense that Grainger hears it as a star turn of sorts, albeit in an aesthetic that has no currency whatsoever? The bigger issue and really the only one, is that for an album so obsessed with physicality, none of its twelve songs operates from the brain, heart or groin. So while Grainger didn’t make a record that tops<i> You’re a Woman, I’m a Machine</i>, he did make one more deserving of its title.</p></div>"|18750.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18750-sebastien-grainger-yours-to-discover/|3.9|Ian Cohen

With <i>Bible Eyes, </i>his 2011 debut album as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29413-egyptrixx/"">Egyptrixx</a>, Toronto-based producer David Psutka took a widescreen approach to his mining of the fertile, boundary-less ground of London dance music label <a href=""http://nightslugs.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Night Slugs</a>. <i>Bible Eyes </i>ran the gamut from lush to harsh, juxtaposed bass and synth in various contortions, and even toyed with guest vocals. Most importantly, it established his knack for seemingly effortless, deeply evocative arpeggiated melodies. </p>
<p>On <i>A/B til Infinity</i>, he flips the mode to zoom. The album focuses in on a specific realm—one he hinted at but abandoned with <i>Bible Eyes</i>’ opener “Start From The Beginning”—and comes off like a study or a soundtrack. Repeated motifs of rain and sirens, metallic surfaces and a sense of impending doom, point to a space between film noir and dystopian sci-fi. It is an underbelly world he traverses, one caught between the audible fizz of digital distraction and the sharp demand for material possessions. Water drips, signals fail, desires echo. </p>
<p>The album’s evocations are overwhelmingly literary, if somewhat familiar. The subdued grandiosity of “Bad Boy” calls to mind Alan Moore’s iconic graphic novel <i>Watchmen, </i>while its sister “Adult” invokes the dual feeling of intrigue and unease that is central to the work of J.G. Ballard. The synthetic choral voices of “Disorbital” stir a feeling of absence, one that <i>Blade Runner</i> fans might associate with the replicant’s fate to mourn memories it never had.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p>That’s not to say <i>A/B til Infinity</i> doesn’t have musical bedfellows. Atmosphere-wise, lines can be drawn to Kuedo’s majestic <i>Severant </i>(which also riffed on some of the same themes), while “Adult” feels in conversation with the taut conceptualization of Night Slugs comrade Jam City’s debut <i>Classical Curves. </i>While <a href=""http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/magazine/egyptrixx-black-metal-feature"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Psutka’s self-proclaimed love of black metal</a> and his recent experience as one half of experimental post-rock/psychedelic duo <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/hiawatha-music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hiawatha</a> aren’t exactly strikingly evident on this second Egyptrixx album, there is a newfound single-minded moodiness that could be credited to the influence of both. There’s no question that <i>A/B til Infinity </i>marks a distinct evolution: it has a stronger, more cohesive identity than <i>Bible Eyes</i>, but where it falls down is when it wallows in that guise. Both “Water” and “My Life is Vivid, My Eyes are Open” feel a little sludgy: their pulse is quicker but the blood runs cold. </p>
<p>Rather, in keeping with the titular theme, the record’s crowning glories are two sides of a flipped coin: the title track’s searing arpeggio that swims closest to the exquisite melodies of <i>Bible Eyes</i> (“Rooks Theme” and “Naples”) and the ambient elevation of final track “A.C.R.R.”. The latter closes the circle on the film noir ambience, shutting out the rain to embark on an internal journey. There is a sense of limbs and lungs stretching, followed by the triumphant punch through to a higher plane. </p></div>"|18768.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18768-egyptrixx-ab-til-infinity/|7.8|Ruth Saxelby

(I recently found out that “ambient gabber” is an actual thing that people are making, as mind-bendingly improbable as that sounds.) What’s notably bold about what the duo (Austin Wilkinson and Elvis Craig of Nashville, Tennessee) are up to isn’t that it hasn’t been done before—it has, a bunch. What makes it a real aesthetic risk is that in the past it’s been done so badly.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">At its most basic, <i>Stealth of Days</i> is R&amp;B from the period during the late 70s and early 80s where the form first fell hard for synthesizers mixed with the smooth, chilled tones of the more self-consciously tasteful end of the late-90s dance music boom. Wilkinson and Craig like to cite the clean-lined works of Ryuichi Sakamoto and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"" target=""_blank"">Christian Fennesz</a> as inspirations. A lot of musicians who were working in the late 90s attempted exactly the same thing, and ended up producing the kind of generic, enervated electronic soul that you mostly hear as background music at restaurants that are trying way too hard to project a hip atmosphere.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>One of the things that keeps the album from following a similar formula is the pair’s ability to steer just shy of the point where tastefulness starts to suffocate a record. <i>Stealth of Days</i> is full of little touches that keep things slightly unbalanced, and therefore compelling. The album-opening “Rain Code” puts a choppy beat behind a satiny R&amp;B vocal melody. “Six Senses” piles layer upon layer of grainy reverb and delay over a two-step beat that in other hands might sound blandly crisp, and occasionally spaces out into brief ambient passages. Throughout the bass synths are dialed a notch or two past “funky” and just into “rude.”</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There are actually enough interesting little quirks like these that you can easily get distracted from the fact that <i>Stealth of Days</i> is at heart a pop record. The compositions are complex, and so fastidiously arranged that you might get sucked into trying to pick out some kind of flaw. Sometimes it’s a little harder to overlook—on “Light Through Lace” and the late-album standout “Under the Rose” you can hear Ryuichi Sakamoto’s influence in the crystalline textures and immaculately composed percussion, but strip all that away and the the tracks on <i>Stealth of Days </i>sound pretty much like they could be New Edition songs.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>During the recent CMJ Music Marathon, Jensen Sportag was booked to perform live at the Cascine Records showcase, but Craig was too sick to perform. Instead, Wilkinson simply DJed their original compositions alongside remixes that they’ve done for other acts. You could tell that it was a hastily assembled fix, and the fact that Wilkinson wasn’t blending the tracks but rather pausing between them to introduce each one made it an awkward experience.

Sent by post, the 22-pound compendium comes in a wide and thick cardboard box, with the name and address of Paramount’s parent enterprise, the long-extinct <a href=""http://paramountshome.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=127:remembrance-on-the-wisconsin-chair-company&amp;catid=48:wisconsin-chair-companyoral-histories&amp;Itemid=54"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wisconsin Chair Company</a>, branded on the side for the sake of authentic anachronism. Inside, two-inch walls of Styrofoam and a plastic sheath protect what Third Man and Revenant Records, the project’s operational partners, call The Cabinet of Wonder.</p>
<p>The hinged-and-clasped oak Cabinet bears Paramount’s iconic medallion on the outside, an eagle with its wings spread and head cocked, talons locked into the label’s name and positioned in front of a grooved record that suggests a morning’s rising sun. The set smells of varnish and glue and furniture—sweet but a little sour, too. Clasp popped, five distinct layers of wonder follow: a batch of six marbled brown LPs housed in an old-fashioned wooden binder; a velum envelope containing replications of ephemera from the earliest days of the recording industry; a hard-cover volume that tells the story of that troublesome start and its biggest stars; and a phone-book sized catalogue that does its best to detail nearly every performer included and, for the first time ever, name each of the thousands of records Paramount released in its two-decade lifespan.</p>
<p>The littlest doll, wedged into a specially cut hole in the green felt platform that lines the box, is a tarnished brass flash drive, playfully dubbed a Jobber-Luxe. The contraption is crafted to look like <a href=""http://www.razzarsharp.com/Phonographs/aIdentify.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the reproducer-and-needle assembly</a> of one of the Wisconsin Chair Company’s Vista Talking Machines, the reason they got into the nebulous and uncertain business of selling records, anyway. It is the ultimate fulfillment of the set’s creative anachronism. The drive contains 800 songs culled from Paramount’s first decade, a fitful and suddenly fertile period that, in many ways, shaped the landscape for the rise of a recording industry anchored on jazz, rock ’n’ roll, and country music. Taken together, these recordings are no less than one blueprint of what has become American music.</p>
<p>Through scrupulous research, audacious design, and ostentatious packaging, this two-volume collection’s first installment does precisely what the best box sets intend to do—add proper deference and context to music that remains vital and significant. Retailing for $400, <i>The Rise and Fall </i>is no doubt expensive, especially considering that there’s a second and complementary volume forthcoming. But at once, it’s a history lesson, a dance hall, a bandstand, and a smoky blues parlor, all tucked neatly into one sturdy box. This is the Cabinet of Wonder, indeed.</p>
<p>The Paramount Records story is one of American entertainment’s great musical curiosities and catalysts. The label started slowly and without certainty, publishing cheap singles so that the people buying monolithic turntables from the Wisconsin Chair Company would actually have something to hear. The label operated with eternal economy, using talent scouts instead of investing in field recording equipment, forgoing demos, and working in cheap studios where even some of the best takes were of mediocre quality.</p>
<p>But the real jolt to the company—and the reason this set so closely mirrors the sound at the start of its country’s music industry—came with the arrival of Mayo Williams. A proud and cunning black man and former professional football player, Williams had gone to Brown and worked a stint as a salesman for the blues-and-jazz-heavy record label Black Swan. When Paramount purchased Black Swan, he traveled to Wisconsin from Chicago in 1923 to ask for a job; he emerged as a talent scout, a talent manager, and the true pioneer of the short-lived empire that pushed Paramount toward the front of <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/jazz/exchange/exchange_race_records.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the emerging “race records” industry</a>—that is, recording black music to sell to black listeners.</p>
<p>“There’s 14 million Negroes in our great country and they will buy records if recorded by one of their own, because we are the only folks that can sing and interpret hot jazz songs just off the griddle,” Mamie Smith’s impresario, <a href=""http://www.planetslade.com/black-swan-blues3.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Perry Bradford</a>, had said in 1920. Mamie had happened upon a hit for Okeh; the year Williams arrived in Wisconsin, Bessie Smith had done the same at Columbia. Williams’ professed specialty had become a suddenly hot commodity and his subsequent discovery, advocacy, and management of his artists made stars that, in turn, made movements. With Blind Blake and Blind Lemon Jefferson, Ma Rainey and Ethel Waters, Williams turned Paramount into an artistic institution if only by sheer commercial willpower. Williams left the company in 1927, the year that this volume—which documents the rise of Paramount just before its Depression-abetted fall—ends.</p>
<p>The structure and sound of many of the songs found throughout <i>The Rise and Fall</i> and within the archives of Paramount’s peers proved foundational to the shape of modern music. But pondering the historical implications of Papa Charlie Jackson’s acrid wit and aggressive playing or the twinkling roar of Jimmy Blythe’s piano runs the risk of ignoring this set’s most incredible invitation: to let these songs simply play (on vinyl, in iTunes, or through the customized and customizable playlists included on the Jobber-Luxe) and to immerse oneself in some incredible, make-or-break performances. It’s tempting to get lost in the high-design grandeur of the Cabinet of Wonder, but this music—gathered piecemeal from the collections of enthusiasts all over the world, fighting always through a scrim of static on these remastered recordings—is the <i>raison d’être</i>, the heart of a box alive with history.</p>
<p>When these songs were made, they existed on the bleeding edge of entertainment and society, with black suddenly meeting white, farm suddenly meeting city, sound suddenly meeting cylinder. Indeed, many of the performers here, such as Ma Rainey, represent the coming senescence of their chosen forms, while folks like blues patriarch Blind Lemon Jefferson, plainspoken country singer Ernest Stoneman and the incredibly versatile pianist Lovie Austin, all included here, represent the development of their own respective frontiers. <i>Rise and Fall</i> lets you slip back into that moment, to pretend that these blues and sermons and silly songs are your vernacular, too.</p>
<p>Allow that, and the Wonders come quickly. Jelly Roll Morton and Ma Rainey, James P. Johnson and Blind Blake, the North Carolina Ramblers and Fletcher Henderson: They’re among the popular standbys represented here. But the real joy of these 800 tracks comes with the personal discoveries. Alabama bluesman Ed Bell recorded only four songs for Paramount in 1927. All included in this box, they share a childlike sense of rhythm, with Bell starting and stopping and bounding between tinny notes in fits of whimsy. His voice is not as heavy or as haunting as those of his Southern contemporaries, giving it a singsong approachability. There are two 1924 tunes from Ukulele “Bob” Williams, where social provocation supporting the then-jailed Marcus Garvey and Republican public policy takes the guise of jaunty little numbers for four strings and a jubilant voice. The Norfolk Jubilee Quartette delivers wonderfully woozy harmonies, particularly on the stepwise and springy “Pleading Blues” or their torpid and bass-anchored “Swing Low Sweet Chariot”. Over swiveling horns and simple piano, Baltimore’s Viola Bartlette winks and smiles as she sings of the archetypal dilemma between welcoming a new lover and not disappointing old dad, either. Trixie Smith takes a decidedly less reserved approach on “My Man Rocks Me (With One Steady Roll)”, a salacious tune about sex that lasts for the better part of a day (13 hours!) and treats double entendre and suggestive rhymes as conscripts. “There’s no slippin’ when he once takes hold,” she purrs, pointing a direct arrow toward the radio dial nearly a century later.</p>
<p>But <i>The Rise and Fall </i>is not just a glob of music. One of the most carefully considered sets I’ve ever seen, it<i> </i>puts these 800 tunes and the entire Paramount picture into a multidimensional context. Due to a lack of proper record-keeping, many of these sessions, songs, and musicians still hover in a cloud of mystery. Who played what on a session? When were they recorded? What songs are still left to be discovered? Thanks to an encyclopedic ream of research done by some of the most dedicated names in this particular act of audio archeology, <i>The Rise and Fall</i> works in earnest to tell the stories behind it all. The set includes hundreds of advertisements rescued from the era and recreates <i>in toto</i> a 1924 Paramount catalogue and <i>The Paramount Book of Blues</i>,<a href=""http://www.mainspringpress.com/blues_bob.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> a 1927 guide</a> to the label that featured several laughable dossiers of the artists and bunches of sheet music.</p>
<p>Aside from hours of intrigue, such materials also make it clear that not much has changed during 90 years of the music industry: Just as Third Man proprietor Jack White and Black Keys singer Dan Auerbach <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/jack-white-dan-auerbach-beef-karen-elson-emails/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">feud in public now</a>, so did diametric vixens Alberta Hunter and Ethel Waters then. Just as big labels seek the next trend on which to turn a fast dime now, Paramount’s pursuit of black musicians stemmed from surprise hits on other labels then. And just as social media now attempts to lure listeners via must-click-here promotion, Paramount’s illustrated advertisements <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Defender"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in the <i>Chicago Defender</i></a> and its insistence that it had discovered singers then practically demanded that regular folks spend more on their records than anything else in life. “Race’s Favorite Stars on Paramount,” read one 1923 promotion. “Every Christian home will prize this record,” read another, stopping just short of suggesting that <i>not</i> buying that particular Norfolk Jubilee Quartette single would guarantee eternal damnation. The music industry, it seems, always begot high stakes.</p>
<p>In the beginning and, really, throughout most of the label’s history, the executives at Paramount and its parent company did not seem to understand the important trove they were building. During half of the era covered in this volume, for instance, the label released lots of baubles and bores, patriotic songs and symphonic recordings that simply didn’t excite like what came later. The possibility of music hadn’t occurred to them. And even when Williams was leading the race record series to dizzying sales and helping fuel the sound of a nation now suddenly listening, he wasn’t on salary. Otto Moeser, the president of the whole operation, once instructed Williams to take the freight elevator to a meeting in a lavish Chicago hotel. This was the 20s, after all, and Williams was a black man marketing records to black customers. That same oblivion resulted in the incomplete records and the destruction of the<a href=""http://www.mainspringpress.com/nyrl.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> label’s archives </a>when it went belly-up, a scene vividly limned by Scott Blackwood in the wondrous liner notes. Such retrospective ignorance makes the trove of <i>The Rise and Fall </i>that much more remarkable, valuable, and edifying. This is almost-lost history, faithfully restored.</p>
<p>But Third Man and Revenant seem to have the opposite—if notably less problematic—quandary: They truly understand the cultural and historical cachet of what they have gathered, and they present it with a clear respect. That’s something that Paramount itself, with its budget materials and condescending advertisements that played fast and loose with social stereotypes, certainly did not. But now, the riches come tucked away in a new oak box, lavishly packaged and highly priced so that mostly only <a href=""http://www.fuse.tv/2013/10/why-i-paid-37100-for-one-record"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the rich old men </a>who already have an enthusiasm for this stuff will have access to it. It’s a reissue cycle that seems to push the music only another decade or so away from extinction. These Cabinets of Wonder, however impressive, will slowly but almost certainly become Coffins of Disuse, limited to the 5,000 people who hoard them.</p>
<p>“If people only want the songs, there are probably are other sources for most of it,” Dean Blackwood, who co-founded Revenant with his management client and friend John Fahey in the mid 90s, told me recently. “This is more about people with a fascination for the tactile and sensory world. That just can’t be replicated in the digital realm.”</p>
<p>But it doesn’t need to be that way. With a sigh, Blackwood adds that selling the 5,000 manufactured copies of each volume will essentially make <i>The Rise and Fall</i> effort a break-even enterprise, despite the decade of work and global contributions that went into it. Why, then, not pad the income a bit by making the music accessible to those who can’t plunk down a car payment on a box set, perhaps by selling the USB drives for $100 or streaming the assets through a subscription service, such as the one provided to the press for this release? If the point of this labor is to give the music included both reverence and eternal life, as its mere existence suggests, is there any better end than making sure as many people as possible hear it? Why save something only to let it sink into sure atrophy?</p>
<p>Almost a century ago, the miserly folks at Paramount would have found a way to make sure more people heard these tunes, if only to make yet another dollar. There’s something commendable about <i>not </i>doing that, but you can’t really hear that, can you?</p></div>"|18703.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18703-the-rise-fall-of-paramount-records-volume-one-1917-1932/|9.2|Grayson Currin

Such drama, if it can be called that, is perfectly fitting for this band, who seemed to arrive with a weight of experience on their shoulders after forming from the ashes of </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphalt_Ribbons"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Asphalt Ribbons</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> in the early 1990s. On their earliest singles Tindersticks were a mesh of low production values and awkward transitions, while their vision for the band was strung somewhere between the underground and the orchestra pit. It's a feeling that remains intact despite higher production values and work with actual orchestras. There's an awkwardness to Tindersticks' confessionals that make their songs deeply personal despite the grander scope they sometimes operate within.</span></p>
<p>This album, a series of reworkings of previously recorded tracks, plus a couple of solo compositions by singer Stuart Staples, skips the earliest period of the band altogether. None of those nascent singles feature, nothing from their imperious first album is picked over<span>—</span>if this is a birthday celebration, it's one that quietly slips the yellowing baby pictures into a bottom drawer. The overhauls are light, for the most part. Sometimes there's a touch of confidence in Staples' vocal that wasn't there before, or a horn part replaces a string section. The presence of multi-instrumentalist Dickon Hinchliffe is missed, as it has been since the lineup change in late 2006, but sometime collaborator <a href=""http://www.terryedwards.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Terry Edwards</a> makes a more than capable replacement, scattering trumpet and saxaphone over a handful of songs to bring out an extra dimension or two.</p>
<p>Tindersticks suffered from being so fully formed on their inception, making a debut album that continues to tower over most of their output. Their ""imperial phase"" (to borrow a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/poptimist/7811-poptimist-29/"">Neil Tennant-ism</a>) continued through their second record, taking in highlights that included a couple of superior live albums. Things begin to taper off after that, only recovering on the surprise return to form with last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16307-tindersticks/""><i>The Something Rain</i></a>. The earliest work featured here is from their second record, the highlight of which is a subtly tweaked ""Sleepy Song"" that maintains the original's cacophonic bloodrush of instrumentation in its final third. Tindersticks often face <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26031-nick-cave-the-bad-seeds/"">Nick Cave</a> comparisons, but the gloomy bedsit pining of a song like ""A Night In"" highlights a contrast between the two. Cave may have been cheated by love, but he's also cocksure and successful at it. Staples is all crumpled suits and apprehension, consigned to his fate instead of rising above it.</p>
<p>What's most interesting about Tindersticks' career arc is how they retain their sense of vulnerability throughout. Even a track like ""Say Goodbye to the City"", originally from 2003's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8071-waiting-for-the-moon/""><i>Waiting for the Moon</i></a>, has the air of someone spilling a cheap cup of tea over a moth-eaten <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2903-ennio-morricone/"">Ennio Morricone</a> sleeve as they attempt to emulate him in a gloomy North London practice space. There's a touch more swagger to this version, but Staples hasn't lost the frailty in his voice. This is a band that appropriated popular paintings found in U.K. thrift stores for their earliest record covers, and there's still an aspect of that mindset at work, a feeling of rummaging through borrowed memories and once treasured artefacts. No matter how big they aim there's always a remnant of their origin story tugging at their sleeve, bringing them back to Mike Leigh territory even when they’re reaching for Leone.</p>
<p>For <i>Across Six Leap Years</i> Tindersticks convened in Abbey Road, along with a host of guest musicians. There's a little extra room in the sound, giving keyboard player David Boulter, always the most dapper member of the band, a chance to shine. The subtle chime of his Rhodes playing beautifully underpins the band's second stab at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey_(band)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Odyssey</a>'s ""If You're Looking for a Way Out"", while tingling dual piano motifs on ""What Are You Fighting For?"" help lift an otherwise by-the-numbers Tindersticks tune. If there's a criticism here it's in the way these songs don't stray far from the original pieces, instead working as tasteful updates that add a dab of cohesion that was never needed in the first place. It's a treat for fans, which is really all a project like this is ever going to be. But it also highlights a continuity in their work, where Staples' small, sad stories don't usually end up in a better place, or any place other than where their protagonist started out. Instead, Tindersticks simply grapple with how it is to be.</p></div>"|18755.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18755-tindersticks-across-six-leap-years/|7.4|Nick Neyland

Unlike conventional songwriting, whose intentions are usually pretty clear, the any-sound-goes approach often provokes the question “why are you doing this?” For some artists, seriousness of intent and dedication to craft are self-evident answers. But others also see the question as a chance to play, to be humorous or ridiculous or twisted or confusing. In other words, to laugh and make you ask again. At its most absurd, that kind of experimental music is like a trippy cartoon, dizzyingly unpredictable and fearlessly free. That’s why <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4725-john-zorn/"">John Zorn</a> found so much inspiration in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Stalling"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carl Stalling</a>, whose zany mash-up compositions scored many Warner Brothers cartoons.</p>
<p>Absurdity has shown up in the individual work of experimenters C. Spencer Yeh, Okkyung Lee, and Lasse Marhaug, so their collaboration as part of Software’s SSTUDIOS series seemed likely to spark humorous fireworks. It did: <i>Wake Up Awesome</i> is a bubbling, restless sonic fun house, filled with comic samples, oddball turns, surreal transitions, and enough activity to power a jet engine. It’s not novelty music—many moments, especially those involving Lee’s expressive cello improvisations, are as compelling as the gravest experimental music. But the trio is unafraid to sound novel, silly, or absurd—and that’s what makes listening to them so much fun.</p>
<p>Their attitude is evident right on the surface, in tongue-in-cheek song titles like “Serious Cat’s Milk”, “The Mermaids of Extended Technique”, and “Tonight We Sleep Like Empty Hard Drives”. Those recall the goofy monikers of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19280-boredoms/""><span>Boredoms</span></a><span> songs, and in fact some of the music evokes Boredoms too, minus the psycho shrieks of Yamataka Eye. Both groups create a sense that anything could happen, and that the participants are always eager to surprise. In the case of Yeh, Lee, and Marhaug, that eagerness creates moments that might make you laugh out loud. On “Anise Tongue and Durian Wet Dream”, a sample that sounds torn from a rickety player-piano loops around drools and gargling, while synth squiggles in “Mission: Possible” sound like Pac Man dying. Perhaps funniest is “Throw Down the Fishcake”, whose messy percussion is like a pile of overlapping punch lines.</span></p>
<p>What makes <i>Wake Up Awesome</i> more than just a joke is the way the trio mixes laughs with tension and drama, sometimes simultaneously. That’s most evident in Lee’s cello, which seems able to emit any tone and convey any emotion imaginable. On the aforementioned “Mermaids,” she scrapes out chilly notes that match the grind of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18240-okkyung-lee-ghil/""><span>Ghil</span><span>,</span></a><span> her excellent solo album from earlier this year (which Marhaug helped conceive and record). On “Ophelia Gimme Shelter,” her slow lines are mournful, while on “Mission: Nothing” similar figures are majestically stoic. Cut those moments with Yeh and Marhaug’s punchy interruptions and jarring juxtapositions, and you get a record that can sound like multiple albums playing at once.</span></p>
<p><span>That effect was one of the promises of sample-heavy experiments like turntablism, which seemed capable of smashing hundreds of styles into seconds of music. But outside of the hyper-cut </span><a href=""http://www.plunderphonics.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>""plunderphonics""</span></a><span> of </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Oswald_(composer)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>John Oswald</span></a><span>, much of it stuck to a narrow sonic range, and got predictable pretty quick. Yeh, Marhaug, and Lee avoid that fate by leaning on their well-honed improvisational skills, injecting gravity into </span><i>Wake Up Awesome</i><span>’s airy playfulness. Thus an album spilling with ideas still manages some containment—though when the final track cuts off abruptly, you get the sense that, like kids at recess, this trio stopped playing only because they had to.</span></p></div>"|18728.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18728-okkyung-lee-c-spencer-yeh-lasse-marhaug-wake-up-awesome/|7.2|Marc Masters

Though its punk scene is vibrant and tight-knit, to the point of being kinda quaint, a band looking to break out on a national level needs an almost pathological level of ambition. Of course, you need great songs as well and Title Fight have plenty of those. But as a melodic punk band that functions within a realm that doesn’t have much use for typical signifiers of compositional ambition, their drive is trickier to quantify, a “most likely to succeed” kind that can smack as careerism in the wrong hands. The quartet are productive, they respect their elders (Quicksand/Rivals Schools’ Walter Schreifels produced their proper debut LP, 2011's <i>Shed</i>), they roll with the winners (collaborators and tourmates such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31541-balance-and-composure"">Balance &amp; Composure</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31567-touche-amore/""><span>Touché Amoré</span></a>), they’ve been on three different labels amenable to their sound at the time and they tour relentlessly. That and they have no time for bullshit—Title Fight’s <a href=""https://twitter.com/titlefight"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter account</a> has over 32,000 followers and zero ""followings"", which makes them look far more focused than antisocial.</p>
<p>So, it’s interesting to see their <i>Spring Songs</i> EP called “ambitious” by onlookers, as if that's a new quality for Title Fight. In a way it’s backhanded, suggesting that their previous influences such as Lifetime or Jawbreaker or Saves the Day were necessarily stepping stones to the trad indie-rock sound captured here. But it’s worth keeping in mind that Title Fight are still barely out of their teens, and you know what? That’s not an atypical listening progression for someone who’s growing up right along with Title Fight. And so <i>Spring Songs</i> does manifest a new kind of ambition, which is the band staking out different territory and hoping their fans come along.</p>
<p>The arrangement makes for a tidy introduction: two songs on two sides, split equally between their two vocalists, Ned Russin and Jamie Rhoden.  Moreover, half of <i>Spring Songs</i> finds the vocals lunging out from the newly warm and analog production, the other have them more nestled within the handsomely textured, melodic guitar leads. The permutations allow Title Fight the ability to show just how little they needed to change their overall approach to edge into a new aesthetic. The Rhoden-led <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15874-be-a-toy/"" target=""_blank"">“Be A Toy”</a> susses out the musical currency existing between early-90s Merge and mid-90s pop-punk as well as the emotional underpinning—I mean both cohorts were accused of being “slackers,"" right? And “Be A Toy” finds common ground in a line like “do you regret being used/are you used to it yet?”, trying to get your rocks off while feeling like crap. Meanwhile,  “Blush” counters with the rawer-voiced Russin raging over sour guitars for an effect that’s hooky and also jagged—it’s probably what A&amp;Rs had in mind when trying to find that bridge between <i>Nevermind</i> and <i>Dookie</i>.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">In most aspects, <i>Spring Songs</i> is the loosest Title Fight recording. Ranging from 2:30-4:00 and removing the BPM and rhythmic strictures of punk, these would all be among the longer tracks on previous LPs <i>Shed</i> and <i>Floral Green</i>. Yet, it’s their tightest, most hook-focused songwriting yet. The spare, midtempo “Receiving Line” gives Russin’s lyrics more sonic space to be heard and as a result, a typically topical Title Fight song allows the listener more freedom of interpretation. You sense the emotional tenor when Russin sings “we drove my car that weekend/ 100 miles barely speaking,"" and with an understated economy of words, he gives just enough inside information to pique interest rather than full disclosure “‘I’m sorry for your loss’/you probably get that a lot/we didn’t have to talk/you probably get that.”  “Evolution” feels like the proper term here, as Title Fight are simply teasing out certain aspects that were present of their previous two LPs, particularly <i>Floral Green</i>. And if there are any qualms to be had, it’s in the sense that you’ll be hearing these again soon, that <i>Spring Songs</i> is a teaser rather than a standalone for a band that would probably feel very lazy if they ended 2013 without a proper release.</p>
<p>But <i>Spring Songs</i> does leave a lot to the imagination and not simply in the matter of “what will the next Title Fight album sound like?” Here we have a rock band on an independent record label, whose sound and work ethic are unmistakably punk. And yet, you’re more likely to hear electro-pop or major-label bands such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30747-chvrches/"" target=""_blank"">Chvrches</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"" target=""_blank"">Haim</a> called “indie” more often than Title Fight. How is that? Is it because most of time, genre tags are used to described the perceived fanbase than the music itself? If that's the case, Title Fight really <i>are </i>going indie rock on <i>Spring Songs. </i>But even if it reaches people who aren't familiar with their past work, <i>Spring Songs </i>helpfully shows Title Fight as pretty much the same thing they've always been: an ambitious band that makes very good songs.</p></div>"|18694.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18694-title-fight-spring-songs-ep/|7.2|Ian Cohen

There is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10905-cassie/"" target=""_blank"">Cassie</a>, the one-hit wonder who eventually achieved near-idol status amongst electronic producers enchanted by the icy sensuality of her music, and there is Brandy, whose voice is much richer but who nonetheless found her songs being clipped and looped by the same sort of producers (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a>). There is someone like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5068-ciara/"" target=""_blank"">Ciara</a> and, of course, there is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10601-aaliyah/"" target=""_blank"">Aaliyah</a>, revered now like a goddess thanks to the crushing emotionality of a voice that put her far out of step with the divas of the 90s.</p>
<p>It is even easier to see how the recent adoration for these singers—not just from British boys clicking through Logic, but also from stars like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> (who has an Aaliyah tattoo) and Chris Brown—may have provided a perfect incubator for an artist like Aiko, whose music attempts to hit you in precisely the same way. And it is true: the sustained interest in this sound has likely contributed to her rise, which culminated in <i>Sail Out</i> debuting in Billboard’s Top 10 debut. But more importantly, as the sound of popular rap has continued to take on a form (in mood if not always in sound) mutated from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"" target=""_blank"">Kanye West</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12498-808s-and-heartbreak/"" target=""_blank""><i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i></a>, Aiko’s malleable and far from overpowering voice has become a frequent accompaniment.</p>
<p>In 2013 she has starred on Big Sean’s hit single “Beware"", snaking her way through the track’s ample empty space, and on Drake’s “From Time""  joining Alicia Keys, Nicki Minaj and Rihanna as the only women to appear on any of his albums. (She is also currently opening for Drake on his American tour.) Despite not being a megawatt name, her inclusion on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18511-drake-nothing-was-the-same/"" target=""_blank""><i>Nothing Was the Same</i></a> almost felt like a foregone conclusion: no current vocalist—male or female— better accentuates the damp throb of Drake’s music. If you lie in bed at night in a pitch black room aglow only with the light of an iPhone, Aiko’s voice is the one that might feel the most appropriate.</p>
<p>But being asked to help solidify the mood of a song is an altogether different task than carrying an entire project. Aiko has been around the industry for almost a decade, signing a record deal with Epic as a teenager and eventually surfacing on a number of Black Hippy projects, a pairing that makes perfect sense when you consider that Kendrick Lamar would eventually build a track out of a Janet Jackson sample. But in that time she’s put out only a single full-length, the 2011 mixtape <i>Sailing Soul(s)</i>, which nonetheless featured contributions from Kendrick, Drake, Miguel and Kanye West. <i>Sail Out</i> is Aiko’s first release with the world watching.</p>
<p>Though it is easy to grasp the broad appeal of Aiko’s music, it’s harder to decipher whether the songs are more appealing than the mere atmosphere they create. One issue she doesn’t have is establishing a clear point of view: on <i>Sail Out</i>, she sings exclusively of contentment being just out of her grasp, be it because a relationship is fractured emotionally (“3:16 am”, “WTH”) or by distance (“The Vapors”), or because she has to continue with the motions required of her profession (“Bed Peace”). Regardless, there is an unavoidable longing at the heart of this EP, one that seems connected to her fixation with weed. On “Bed Peace” she sings of a desire to wake up in the middle of the day and light a blunt, but the idea of intoxication is a metaphor she returns to often. On “WTH” she steps back from a sputtering relationship and realizes that she ""might've got way too high"" and on “The Vapors” she links drugs and sex, repeatedly singing “Can I hit it again?”</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem like a coincidence that there is also a distinct numbness to <i>Sail Out</i>. The production—handled by Fisticuffs, a duo that worked heavily on Miguel’s first album—is downtempo and unobtrusive, with percussion coming from drums that are no louder than a snap or a clicking lighter and keyboards that offer a soft bed for Aiko’s vocals. Those vocals are often emotionless; Aiko sings with a medicated distance, never getting too up or too down even when she sings of despair.</p>
<p>It is here where <i>Sail Out</i> is likely to leave some cold. Vocalists like Cassie or Aaliyah were able to convey a spectrum of emotions within a limited vocal range, summoning strength or giddiness or compassion when necessary. Aiko has yet to display this ability, and <i>Sail Out</i> leaves you searching for emotion where it isn’t. Instead there is a glazed-over blankness to her delivery that does these bare-by-design songs little favors.</p>
<p>The EP’s best track is also its outlier. “Bed Peace” is powered by a bouncy, bright guitar strum that blossoms into a chorus of fluttering keyboards, radiant backing vocals, and screwed vocals that bob and weave with Aiko’s own singing. It is the most fully developed track, but more importantly the bliss seems to draw her into easing smoothly into a higher register. It is a subtle shift that feels too much like a revelation.</p></div>"|18777.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18777-jhene-aiko-sail-out-ep/|6.1|Jordan Sargent

After all, he makes music with supreme restraint that seems to unfold with an almost meditative calm, every silence, every reverb tail painstakingly considered. This isn’t a quality commonly associated with grime. But while, at this point, it may be tempting to declare its co-ordinates firmly triangulated—Dizzee, Wiley, Musical Mob’s <i>Pulse X</i>—over the past year a new generation of producers has<i></i> shown that there's still territory left unmapped in this decade-old style.</p>
<p>The London-based James Parker co-runs Boxed, a regular club night that's become something of a hub for this globally dispersed scene. But unlike many new grime artists—the likes of Visionist, Wen, Inkke and countless others—Parker doesn’t bring a youthful vigor to bear on the form. In fact, he’s something of an old hand: his love affair with UK dance music goes back to the late 90s and jungle; by the mid 2000s he was a devotee of legendary dubstep nights FWD&gt;&gt; and DMZ, whilst avidly absorbing grime through pirate radio.</p>
<p>Dubstep singles credited to Logos appeared as far back as 2008, but it wasn’t until last year that Parker would make a splash with the <i>Kowloon</i> EP. Its conceptual conceit was simple—Parker took Wiley’s remarkable and oft-referenced Eskibeat sound and jettisoned it into the cold void of space—but the results were surprisingly rich and absorbing. <i>Cold Mission</i> is Parker’s first solo release since that EP. So while it is, in a sense, one of the first major LPs to emerge from recent currents in grime—and certainly the best—it also belongs to an earlier moment. Parker’s focus on space and the careful application of pressure seems inspired by dubstep. He also invites parallels with other producers who grew to prominence after the style’s demise: ""Ex 101""'s gorgeous warped chords are strongly reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30014-jam-city/"" target=""_blank"">Jam City</a>’s ""Club Thanz"", for example. </p>
<p>Mostly, however, Parker works at the coalface of grime. ""Surface Area (Main Mix)"", with its shattered glass percussion and fanged bass pulses, follows <i>Kowloon</i> in its ultra-minimalist deployment of grime signifiers. The drums function more as interjection than propulsion, and a pervasive ground hum rears up in the in-between spaces, as if we’re hearing the amplified sound of a studio left idle between sessions. Elsewhere this familiar toolbox of sounds is turned to more aggressive ends: in ""Seawolf"", baleful square wave motifs and gun-cocking samples; in ""Menace"", downpitched strings and hovering-UFO bass. In each case Parker’s treatments manage to be both incendiary and wonderfully graceful. It’s like observing some sort of martial art in action, deadly but balletic.</p>
<p>It’s a hackneyed comparison, but Parker’s sonics often evoke rainswept urban dystopias of the <i>Bladerunner</i> variety; or, more specifically, Vangelis’ soundtrack to that film as channeled through the Akai samplers of countless jungle producers (think Dillinja’s evergreen ""The Angels Fell""). Often, in fact, these tracks could be moody jungle breakdowns shorn of context, left to mark time in a state of infinite suspense. It’s an approach that recalls another explorer of rave’s hinterlands, Burial. But unlike his forebear, when Parker pays homage to the nocturnal spaces of his city—""E3 Night Flight"" references an East London postcode—it’s not to mourn but, furtively, to celebrate (the track’s twinkly synth swells reach almost Oneohtrix proportions in the latter half).</p>
<p>As with any truly gifted producer, Parker folds all of these points of reference into an aesthetic that is fascinatingly, unmistakably his own. The only flaws in <i>Cold Mission</i>, in fact, come from the outside. ""Swarming"", with Houston newcomer Rabit, is a macabre delight, but two other collaborations sit like thorns in the album’s side.<i> </i>The fidgety bell-like motif on ""Alien Shapes"", featuring Keysound label bosses Blackdown and Dusk, feels almost painfully literal compared to the artful abstraction found elsewhere. ""Wut It Do"", meanwhile, is one of a string of collaborations between Parker and Mumdance: a body of work with its own internal consistency, but whose ruffneck intensity feels thoroughly out of place here. Still, Logos redeems himself at the close. The “limitless” mix of <i>Kowloon</i> highlight ""Atlanta 96"" sets those ornate synth riffs billowing across gorgeous, glistening, devotional space. It’s as if Parker is drawing a throughline from his past work, via the present, into some unknown future. While it’s not quite perfect, <i>Cold Mission</i> should give us all cause for optimism.</p></div>"|18743.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18743-logos-cold-mission/|8.1|Angus Finlayson

Rhythms, loops, and accents constantly overlap and build. The precision of those intersections is obvious in his clean production style, which gives every element sharp focus. In fact, there are so many fascinating trees in Donoso’s songs, it should be easy to miss the forest. But after I’ve listened to one of his records, I rarely remember something like an pulsing bass line or phrase-turning beat. What sticks is the tone and aura–the atmosphere the music creates and the feelings it induces.</p>
<p>I’m impressed by how much that’s still the case with his latest full-length, <i>As Iron Sharpens Iron, One Verse Sharpens Another</i>. Not that I didn’t expect it—his two previous solo albums, <i><a href=""http://digitalisrecordings.bandcamp.com/album/progress-chance"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Progress Chance</a> </i>and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17241-assimilating-the-shadow/"">Assimilating the Shadow,</a></i> were enticingly atmospheric (the latter is a masterpiece). But compared to those efforts, the eight songs here—split across two vinyl EPs, but released together digitally— are a bit generic. There are more sounds that I’ve heard before or could imagine done by someone else, and there are more overt dance moves where before there were shadows of techno and intimations of house. Yet despite this relative decrease in sonic uniqueness, the effect of Donoso’s music remains powerful. His ability to cast a spell is apparently independent of the specific sounds he uses to do so.</p>
<p>The aura that entrances this time around represents a slight shift as well. <i>Assimilating the Shadow </i>had undercurrents of tension, but for the most part it was hypnotic and dream-like. <i>As Iron Sharpens Iron's </i> tone is darker and more urgent. Rhythms hit harder and more pointedly, as if Donoso wants to stab ears as much as massage them. Where before<i> </i>you could imagine dawn rising to his  flowing waves, here the sun is either on its way down or has been out of the picture for a while. As a result, most of the tracks dare you to listen further as the mood blackens and the mystery thickens.</p>
<p>Donoso’s best songs achieve that effect while cycling through many sounds. In the album’s first half, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16128-the-sphinx/"">“The Sphinx”</a> stands out with puncturing bass and violent melody, but the next track, “Diagonal Environment”, nearly matches it with a synth ripple that tears the air. The second set of tracks has a more linear ascent: the drifting “The Redeemer” leads to the quivering, horror-film-worthy “Open Drawer, Full of Masks"", which in turn births the dark-highway cruise of “The Child Primitive"". Soon enough, Donoso has crafted a narrative arc out of what at first seemed simply like consistent music.</p>
<p>All of this leads to the rare kind of closer that’s truly a culmination. Donoso knows how to create a climax that sums what’s come before while surpassing it. “The Master Game” uses repetition as a weapon, pounding the ground in order to rise toward the sky. Momentum seems an inadeuqate word to describe it–the build achieved by all the gathering sonic threads is beyond tidal. <i>As Iron Sharpens Iron, One Verse Sharpens Another </i>may not be Donoso’s best album, but when “That Master Game” floods the stereo, it feels like his high watermark.</p></div>"|18745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18745-ricardo-donoso-as-iron-sharpens-iron-one-verse-sharpens-anther/|7.2|Marc Masters

The tag implies a nebbish attitude that contrasts starkly with the infinitely entertaining Ron Morelli, head honcho of standout label L.I.E.S.and <i>de facto</i> ringleader of this scene, as well as Dutch wizard of 'wares <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29894-legowelt/"">Legowelt</a>, a producer who even-handedly balances menace and mischievousness. Fellow L.I.E.S. affiliate William Burnett is perhaps the most obvious disciple of Legowelt's encompassing philosophy, pushing out a broad array of electronic oddities at a similarly frantic clip, standing outside convention and away from trends. <a href=""http://sexliesmagnetictape.bandcamp.com/album/willie-burns-presents-land-vs-air"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Land vs Air </i></a>rounds up material Burnett has yet to release, but could have realistically come from any time in the past 20-odd years.</p>
<p>For 14 obtuse pieces smeared across five aliases, there is a peculiar unity to <i>Land vs Air</i> that belies Burnett's scattershot approach. Although the messy nature of the music sidesteps categorization, it's not explicitly difficult to compartmentalize: Black Deer's introductory spate throb with a soft menace; the unhinged Grackle set that follows, conceived during Burnett's self-proclaimed ""dark phase,"" significantly ratchets up the lingering sense of dread; those tracks under the name Willie Burns, as well as new monikers Phobian and Monobol, continue down a more familiar house-leaning route. Ultimately what binds the ragtag assortment of tracks is the lack of clear reference points, making them all the more intriguing; very little here panders to any one extreme. There are no sub-3 a.m. amorphous abstractions to be found, nor eviscerating sheets of noise, nor motorik rhythms. The mixtape as a whole is devoid of color, an abandoned lab in a desolate wasteland where source material has been siphoned off and set to curdle under flickering lights. </p>
<p>That <i>Land vs Air</i>'s physical release comes via Belfast-based cassette emporium Sex Lies Magnetic Tape is apt, a perfect format to airlock the caustic experiments that fill the first half. Given that you have to go six tracks deep to hear a kick drum, the second half represents an about-face, healthy concessions offered to the dancefloor. ""Too Hott"" and ""Honey Let Me"" wrap inviting vocal samples around the kind of interlocking melodic leads and blippy basslines that hark back to the crude 707 heaters of Chicago innovator Steve Poindexter, or falls directly in line with more contemporary proponents like D'Marc Cantu. Burnett continues to consciously stray from the herd, spilling 909 claps out like tacks onto a marble floor across ""121242"", but these tracks remain eminently danceable in spite of their innate weirdness; pleasingly primitive club tools that invite you to loosen up after the unnerving opening run.</p>
<p>While not an especially easy listen, the stridently experimentally-minded <i>Land vs Air</i> grows into its own, gradually dropping the veil and allowing grooves to emerge from underneath the floorboards. Burnett develops his music in a non-linear fashion, rarely holding firm even when hitting on a rewarding streak, but is hardly a sadist. It is unlikely many of these tracks will find a way out of bleary witching-hour sessions, but in pandering to the panda-eyed, Burnett continues to veer further off the map than most, pointedly advancing the ethos that lured people towards the gurgling machinery and analog dissonance in the first place.</p></div>"|18774.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18774-willie-burns-land-vs-air/|7.4|Gabriel Szatan

There were a few other bands slinging the sludgy sound that would soon be known to the world at large as grunge, but those groups—chief among them Soundgarden’s Washington State neighbors Green River, Malfunkshun, and the Melvins—barely shared characteristics. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28049-alice-in-chains/"" target=""_blank"">Alice in Chains</a>, meanwhile, were just finding their feet at the time.) The most striking element that set Soundgarden apart was their commercial viability: Of their peers, Soundgarden had the catchiest songs, the sexiest frontman in Chris Cornell, and the most conventional approach to making music. Catchiness, sexiness, and conventionality were all things grunge would eventually, if briefly, pretend to refute. From the start, though, Soundgarden’s music envisioned—if not promised—a nation of arenas full of flannel.</p>
<p><i>Screaming Life</i> is proof. Along with its 1988 follow-up, the <i>Fopp</i> EP, it’s being reissued by Sub Pop—only this time with a needed Jack Endino remastering job and one bonus track, the jokey throwaway jam “Sub Pop Rock City”, drawn from 1988’s <i>Sub Pop 200</i> compilation. The latter is sheer filler, as is the six-minute dub version of <i>Fopp</i>’s title track and the passable, unremarkable cover of Green River’s seminal “Swallow My Pride”. That leaves eight songs out of 11 worth listening to on the reissue—some more than others. Revisionists tend to gauge Soundgarden solely in the context of grunge, but <i>Screaming Life</i>—and the two songs on <i>Fopp </i>worth listening to, “Fopp” and “Kingdom of Come”—have more in common with what was truly going on in alternative metal circa 1987 and 88: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2166-janes-addiction/"" target=""_blank"">Jane’s Addiction</a>, the Cult, and even Living Colour, each of whom sought to expand the tropes of metal by cross-pollinating it with other styles—not to mention weaving a shroud of alluring otherness in the face of bad-boys-next-door like Mötley Crüe or Poison. The fact that “Fopp” is a thickened cover of the Ohio Players’ 70s funk classic shows that, in a parallel universe, Soundgarden could just have easily turned into Faith No More.</p>
<p>But they didn’t. Soundgarden wound up drawing from a broad palette while avoiding the funk-metal trap that so many of their contemporaries succumbed to. Even their breakthrough albums—1991’s <i>Badmotorfinger </i>and 1994’s <i>Superunknown</i>—owe more to progressive rock and psychedelia, respectively, than to grunge. Some of that structural oddness and swirling murk can be heard on <i>Screaming Life</i>, albeit sporadically. If anything, <i>Screaming Life</i> comes on like gothic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"" target=""_blank"">Led Zeppelin</a>. “Hunted Down” is cavernous and “Immigrant Song”-like in its pseudo-mythic chug, while “Tears to Forget” echoes the metallic gallop of “Communication Breakdown”. Cornell’s voice veers from Robert Plant majesty—steeped, though, in deeper shadows—to a scalding screech that he’d soon ditch in favor of a more melodic wail. “Entering” starts out with a drumbeat that resembles, of all things, Bauhaus’s “Bela Lugosi’s Dead” before morphing into lesser groove-rock aerobics. Finally tapping into the Black Sabbath wellspring that came to be a grunge stereotype, Soundgarden turns “Nothing to Say” into a ringing, doom-laden drone. “Little Joe” is <i>Screaming Life</i>’s lone disposable track, another foray into stiff-necked quasi-funk that feels squishy and unformed, as do Cornell’s monotone histrionics.</p>
<p>He’d get better from there, as would all of Soundgarden. Not that you’d know it listening to “Kingdom of Come”—a would-be party anthem complete with douchey double entendre that wastes the talent of Kim Thayil, turning one of the most subtly inventive guitarists of his generation into a vending machine for riffs. It in no way predicts what the band was about to accomplish on its brooding, full-length debut for SST, 1988’s <i>Ultramega OK</i>, let alone during its stunning major-label years. Soundgarden would go on to become the most challenging of the mainstream grunge titans; 1996’s <i>Down on the Upside</i> is every inch as dense and harrowing as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18517-nirvana-in-utero-20th-anniversary-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>In Utero</i></a>. But in 1987, Soundgarden had no way of knowing that rock as they knew it was about to radically change around them. Grunge has long been touted as the revolutionary insurrection that rendered hair-metal obsolete. But <i>Screaming Life/Fopp</i> is music that seemed to want to <i>save </i>hair-metal, not do away with it. And in that sense, it’s a halting, hesitant half-triumph.</p></div>"|18756.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18756-soundgarden-screaming-life-fopp/|6.7|Jason Heller

The Brooklyn group’s 10-year career is studded with songs that lope and drift. They often float around some elusive target for a while before landing on it—or, just as often, missing it completely (and compellingly). At best, the tactic is mind-bending. It sneaks hooks, melodies, and climaxes past your brain’s pattern-detector, directly warping your passive receptors like a drug. Even when direct hits aren’t scored, the group’s wandering can be fascinating on its own, encouraging anticipation and sounding like little other music of the past decade.</span></p>
<p>You might expect Excepter’s new EP, <i>Christisland</i>, to be another step along this dizzy path, since its two songs both last over 10 minutes. And to be sure, these aren't tight compositions with crystal clear goals. But they both center on simple, relatively straight-forward beats that persist from beginning to end. It’s not a totally new move for the band, but usually with pieces this long they shift gears a few times, fusing disparate parts or diverging into tangents. In that way Excepter is kind of an electronic jam band, which I guess makes <i>Christisland </i>their krautrock: steady beats that reach lysergic highs like a desert road leading to a blinding sun.</p>
<p>So how much tension and surprise is left when Excepter stick to one rhythm? Still quite a lot, it turns out. Both tracks on <i>Christisland </i>pile many sounds on top of their pulses, which are like heartbeats in the middle of a hurricane. Side one’s title track is the windier and wetter of the two. The group pelts its beat with whirring chords, slippery synths, overlapping babble, and skewed percussion darting around the beat. At points it replicates the sky-seeking build of Excepter’s live shows, but it doesn’t really <i>feel </i>live, as overdubbed elements add a surreal sheen.</p>
<p>On the flipside, “Beargarden” plays like the come-down after “Christisland”’s summit climb–or perhaps like the next morning’s hangover. Slow, creepy, and dense, it has a distinctly nightmare-ish vibe. Yet a rising organ-like tone makes it also hymn-like, as if the horror movie it’s soundtracking was set in a big, cavernous chruch. At times, the trudging beat and stirring chords converge so snugly that “Beargarden” becomes one of the most conventional-sounding things Excepter has done.</p>
<p>Still, <i>Christisland </i>is perhaps best appreciated by aficionados, who’ll hear echoes of Excepter’s previous work haunting both tracks. Typically, the band themselves have already moved on: a <a href=""http://www.excepter.net/Discography.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">full-length</a> due in January features shorter songs and clearer, more present singing. Perhaps Excepter doesn’t get enough credit for how often they vary their attack, something that’s easy to miss inside all improvised meandering. From that perspective, <i>Christisland </i>may ultimately rank as an intriguing side-step. But when it’s actually playing, it sounds like feet firmly planted in new turf.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p></div>"|18725.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18725-excepter-christisland/|6.9|Marc Masters

On their new, self-titled mini-LP,  they've connected with Brooklyn noise-rock Svengali Ben Greenberg: As a result, they sound loose, sloppy, careening, <i>serious—</i>you know, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29754-the-men/"" target=""_blank"">the Men</a>. The Men's influence in the underground rock community has grown to a near-deafening peak, and Greenberg, through his work with bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30538-sleepies/"" target=""_blank"">Sleepies</a>, Pampers, and <a href=""http://pythonpatrol.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">countless others</a>, acts as its chief proselytizer. There is a minor mini-Albini effect to his studio presence: Bands that work with him don't necessarily come out sounding like the Men, but his touch tends to locate a certain something—a pile-driving, sweaty intensity. <br/><br/>At any rate, Fins sound surpassingly great right now, a thrillingly noisy three-piece finding their voice and footing. Under Greenberg's watch, their sound is more anchored and twice as explosive, a cathartic skid that doesn't match up point-for-point with any specific strain of punk. In <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZerCmRtIen8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a charmingly terrible local interview</a>taped in a Connecticut basement, all three members mention <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8693-husker-du/"" target=""_blank"">Hüsker Dü</a> and Rites of Spring (oh, and R.E.M.), but you can also hear <i>Bleach</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a> in the queasy sludge bass line that opens up ""Passing"". Their attack is nervy and excitable, hitting a cluster of potent feelings located all along the hardcore/punk/emo axis—triumph, anxiety, panic, exhilaration, defiance.</p>
<p><i>FINS</i> register on first contact like a clawing blur, just like a punk tape should. Vocalist and lead guitarist John Lydon screams every word with knee-buckling intensity, and drummer Nate Sadowski belongs to my favorite school of punk drumming, that of the unerringly precise-wild-eyed flailer. But the longer you spend with the songs, the more they begin to slow down and breathe.  In a scraped-raw power trio lineup like this, the instruments have to do a lot of economic work, and bassist Scott Bowers-DeFino might be their secret weapon. He imbues every scraping din with its melodic glint: His four-note riff on ""Passing"" might be the album's catchiest melody, and his bass lines on ""Sockets"" and ""Branches"" are those songs' chief hooks. If you're humming something from this record, in fact, there is a ninety-percent chance Bowers-DeFino played it.</p>
<p>It's unclear what Lydon is getting off his chest here without a lyric sheet, but it's pressingly obvious that it's life-or-death important to him. His  scream has a little bit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Cloud+NOthing"">Dylan Baldi</a>'s jagged, void-everything edge to it, and when he gets a hold of a good word, he shreds it to pieces —the word ""suggestions"" leaving his throat, on ""Sockets,"" feels like it is carrying bits of internal organ out along with it. His euphoria feels real, and galvanizing, and it gets ahold of your fight-or-flight receptors. His neurochemical message is clear:  He's vulnerable, he's invincible. Or, as he screams in a rare intelligible moment on ""Shattered"": ""I'm standing upright/ I'm standing, alright/ I'm feeling shattered.""</p></div>"|18740.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18740-fins-fins/|7.5|Jayson Greene

It’s easy to understand why people get offended by their dick moves, both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/48035-listen-to-death-grips-no-love-deep-web-now/"">literal</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51748-death-grips-didnt-show-up-to-their-lollapalooza-aftershow-fans-destroy-bands-equipment/"">figurative</a>. But for anyone invested in the group as an artistic entity, all of this retro and regressive Punk 101 chicanery serves as a distraction or a depletion from music that derives a purer shock value by sounding like it has no real precedent. If nothing else, their fourth album <i>Government Plates</i> is a reminder that, right, Death Grips make music! And it drops without any narrative context or controversy about its packaging, its label situation, or their disappearance from social media—like your parents, Death Grips have a Facebook page and unlike <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17216-no-love-deep-web/"">NO LOVE DEEP WEB</a></i> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18681-sky-ferreira-night-time-my-time"">Sky Ferreira’s album</a>, <i>Government Plates </i> boasts a cover that won’t get you temporarily booted off the site. With a lack of external talking points and most of indie rock's ire currently being directed elsewhere, <i>Government Plates </i> loudly reestablishes Death Grips as a group freed by having no ideals whatsoever, making music without a past about a present with no future.</p>
<p>And here’s the squalid moment in which Death Grips find themselves: a bottle breaks, an air raid siren serves as MC Ride’s alarm clock, and he defaces his scrambled, arrhythmic rapping with batshit shrieking. Is it meant to suggest that he’s waking up from a bad dream? Or is he just being tasered mid-verse? As you might expect, <i>Government Plates</i> spends about half its time expressing its paranoia and the other half justifying it; enforcers are shadowy and lurking, their use of power always theoretical and impending, spelled out in the titles for people who have no interest in engaging with the thrilling music herein. But are we to cut through the battered radio soundclash of “Bootleg (Don't Need Your Help)” and the mesmerizing drones of seven-minute closer “Whatever I Want (Fuck Who’s Watching)” with Occam’s Razor and assume it’s all directed at Epic or concert promoters?</p>
<p>You could do that, though <i>Government Plates</i> functions as a Rorschach and not just because many of these songs are ugly, amorphous inky splatter. Throughout, Ride smears words and multiple meanings unwittingly tease themselves out—darting over and through Zach Hill’s drums like they're a tire maze, Ride mutters “L.A. creeping under my skin,” or possibly “scales.” This is from “Big House”, so is the title an understood synonym for prison or a reference to how <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49045-watch-death-grips-short-film-for-come-up-and-get-me-shot-last-year-at-chateau-marmont/"">Death Grips blew Epic’s money by living at the Chateau Marmont</a>? During “Birds”, is Ride saying “I got higher, I got fake”? Or is it, “I got hired, I got fake?”  “I got hired, I got paid”? Is it a critique of drugs, of corporate influence or a boast about how Death Grips have made a career largely out making people who give them money look stupid?</p>
<p>It’s easy to assume something this purposefully noided is Death Grips crafting a response, that they’ve been cornered by the music industry, expectations of fans, something on the outside. But to conclude that Death Grips are reacting to anything strips them of their unique power. You will learn nothing about how they feel about, say, about Obamacare, the NSA or <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus"">Yeezus</a></i>, a record that may have not been directly influenced by Death Grips but was likely aware of their existence. Death Grips may have endured a tough year, but they brought almost all of it upon themselves, and<i> Government Plates</i> is a pointedly <i>proactive</i> record that seeks out its own stimuli; and that’s why their pranks are nowhere near as interesting as their self-inflicted stunts. As with Bikram yoga or a hunger strike, artificially heightened circumstances help them realize internal purity.</p>
<p>So <i>Government Plates</i> isn’t defined by dissonance, volume, or abrasion so much as discomfort, Death Grips trying to figure out how to advance a sound that won’t stay still. “You might think he loves you for your money but I know what he really loves you for it's your brand new leopard skin pillbox hat” is a good place to start. That’s an unwieldy title that at least has room to say everything it needs to. The song itself cramps what could otherwise be a wubbed-out dubstep appropriation into a gawky 6/8 meter. Ride discovers a staggered cadence that works between corroded pinwheel synths and drums that evoke the crunch of a stomped cockroach during “Anne Bonny”. Then the beat switches just to see if he’s willing to contort himself into its spaces (he accepts).   </p>
<p>You can certainly project anger onto Death Grips, it’s tough to imagine happy people making this kind of music.  But hey, might as well party at ground zero. Death Grips can actually be fun, or at least promise a payoff to all this stress. In that way, it recalls <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16512-death-grips-the-money-store/"">The Money Store</a></i>, which in retrospect was the kind of album a major label would’ve been very pleased with after signing Death Grips, i.e., one with actual bars-and-hooks songs. <i>Government Plates</i> is also filled with hooks, if you remember that the word is also a synonym for a boxer connecting flush with your face. MC Ride is every bit as percussive as Zach Hill, and Zach Hill’s drums can prove to be a mouthpiece that’s more fluent and expressive than its human counterpart. “Two Heavens” and “Im Overflow” in particular are hip-hop as survivalist minimalism, merging little more than vocal texture and percussion into chest-puffing B-boy boasts.</p>
<p>And hell, Death Grips can be kinda funny, too. You can’t be this premeditated with knowing what people think about you and if it wasn’t clear that a) there is a joke and b) Death Grips is in on it, there’s a song called “This is Violence Now (Dont get me wrong)”. Remember when MC Ride namedropped <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> curiosity “Blue Jay Way” and Santana’s <i>Abraxas</i> on <i>The Money Store</i><i>?</i>  If not, the first song on <i>Government Plates</i> is a Bob Dylan reference. If a Dadaist Death Grips nursery rhyme sounds hilarious in concept, that’s because <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15927-birds/"">“Birds”</a> is pretty much just that. Ride sneers “I cop this attitude at all times,” in a posh, flippant accent, the kind attributable to someone vapid enough to say “I cop this attitude.”</p>
<p>An awkward one-off upon its original release, “Birds” serves as a pivot for <i>Government Plates</i>, the point where “new Death Grips” starts to become Death Grips doing something legitimately new. Some parts of <i>Government Plates</i>are actually pretty and not in that perverse, S&amp;M way. And during the second half, they get awfully close to proper dance music, or at least its rigorous structure and of course, this formalism makes for even more interesting tension. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">“Feels like a wheel” is Death Grips’ take on HI-NRG drum and bass, which is to say, it focuses less on emotional ecstasy than the artificial components and side effects of the club drug, the toxic chemicals and fried nerve endings.</span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> The only intelligible lyric is “let me live my life,” which turns the title into a double entendre, it could mean “rolling” or just being stuck. “Im overflow” about sums up how Death Grips react to stability and yet it hinges on Ride’s most straightforward battle rapping, punctuated with a yell of “hot shit!’  </span></p>
<p><i>Government Plates</i> isn’t here to teach you a lesson. When Death Grips are overt about what they think, they often come off like bratty teenagers, acting out against people who want to help them. Unlike the blunt, confrontational <i>NO LOVE DEEP WEB</i>, <i>Government Plates</i> lets you think for yourself and even if it doesn’t have an agenda, that doesn’t mean it’s nihilistic.  It’s music that doesn’t care about how you feel, just how you react to it. All the same, it doesn’t exist in a vacuum and when Death Grips interact with the public, they can produce something elemental, in a literal sense where the periodic table can take violent turns: oxidation, sulfur fumes, nitrous, horrible fluorescents and neon, fossil fuel. Or, maybe a hydrogen bomb, with all of its attendant amorality: Death Grips provide the power, you provide the politics.</p></div>"|18779.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18779-death-grips-government-plates/|8.4|Ian Cohen

It’s an appropriate seven tracks, arranged to be reasonably cohesive across a half-hour, and concerned only with a handful of musical ideas, which it teases out intelligently and patiently. So far so good. Bird fashioned the release around a single song, “Pulaski at Night”, which he wrote but did not want to hold until he had enough for a full-length. Instead, he composed a handful of instrumentals to form lengthy prologues and epilogues to “Pulaski”, comparing it to soundtracking a film. So think of the EP as the director’s cut of the main song. Or an extended mix. Or a short suite. Think of it as an EP, however, and it feels slight—never quite the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>“<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52871-listen-andrew-bird-pulaski-at-night-from-new-ep/"">Pulaski at Night</a>” is prime Bird: tightly crafted, lyrically witty, understated yet sophisticated in its arrangement of loops and plucks and thrums and whistles. “I paint you a picture of Pulaski at night,” he sings on the chorus. “Come back to Chicago, city of light.” The galloping violin strums give that sneaky hook its subdued grandeur and steady insistence, Bird’s bow tracing the topography of the Midwestern landscape. It sounds as though he’s trying to erase the many miles between him and the person he’s addressing, who is clearly far away. <a href=""http://youtu.be/Gb5O71O5llU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">At one of his Gezelligheid shows last winter</a>, Bird explained the song’s origins and specified which Pulaski inspired him, but there’s something so teasingly vague about the song's shadowy “you” that it’s better left unexplained. On its own, the song could be about a departed friend, a distant lover, or every fan who isn’t in the town Bird is playing that night. </p>
<p>If “Pulaski at Night” is Bird at his most dependably and stalwartly Romantic, the rest of the EP is just Bird. There is, admittedly, a warm familiarity to the plaintively whistled theme of “Lit from Underneath”, to the staccato plucks of “Hover 1”, to the evocative bowing on “Hover 1”. As well, a few unexpected flourishes illuminate some of these songs, such as the loose-limbed raga rhythm on opener “Ethio Invention No. 1” and the quickly fading notes that arc across “Logan’s Loops”. At times that familiarity curdles into predictability, and nothing else carries the sense of purpose and longing as the title track. Not that Bird needs to reinvent himself on a minor release like this one, but an EP is an ideal medium for indulging new experiments and rethinking one’s approach. The most innovative and intriguing aspect of <i>Pulaski </i>is not its music, but ultimately its not-quite-definable form. </p></div>"|18753.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18753-andrew-bird-i-want-to-see-pulaski-at-night/|6.5|Stephen M.

As a literal reflection of Kirby's musical shifts, it couldn't be more appropriate. This is, after all, a guy who has recorded under the names Notorious P.I.G. and Billy Ray Cyrix. He's best known for two projects—the bizarre cut-ups he conducted as V/Vm, and his work as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29716-the-caretaker/"">the Caretaker</a>, whose <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15518-an-empty-bliss-beyond-this-world/""><i>An Empty Bliss Beyond This World</i></a> repurposed old 78 rpm recordings to beautiful effect. The latter was a triumph of content over concept, suggesting there's more to Kirby than the arch prankster, laughing into his sleeve while smearing blood and vomit over memories of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0ofp0a-Qwk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chris de Burgh</a>.</p>
<p>The Stranger picks at a thread Kirby started on the Caretaker records, once again returning to an area that loosely grapples with memory, loss, and fear. His work has peers<span>—</span>even the idiosyncratic approach to V/Vm wasn’t too far removed from artists such as <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=stock+hausen+and+walkman&amp;oq=stock%2C+hausen&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l2j69i60j0.3851j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stock, Hausen &amp; Walkman</a> and <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Kid606"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kid606</a><span>—</span>but <i>Watching Dead Empires in Decay</i> is his first record that feels like it's slotting into a scene instead of operating on its fringes. It's cast into a similar shadow to the one artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-mirror-reflecting-part-2/"">the Haxan Cloak</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30862-raime/"">Raime</a> are working under, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/"">Demdike Stare</a> before them. The Stranger's music carries a similar air of reimagined nightmares, depicted as places full of precipitous surfaces and figures endlessly plodding through violent terrain.</p>
<p>By working in this area Kirby is continuing his fascination with memory, arguably taking it even further out into the abstract than he has before. Where <i>Bliss</i> was all faded glamor and ruminations on a time long passed, <i>Dead Empires</i> dwells harder on the darker subconscious, giving it a tactile edge that replaces the suggestive ambience of the Caretaker material. There's also a greater reliance on drama and narrative. The way the skeletal beats of ""Spiral of Decline"" build is suggestive of a particularly unpleasant turn in a movie, and the standout ""Where Are Our Monsters Now, Where Are Our Friends?"" is driven by powerful slabs of electronic noise that highlight Kirby's ear for suspense.</p>
<p>Where Kirby succeeds over some of the lesser artists currently plowing this field is in the detail he lends to his work. There's a grain to his samples, perhaps inspired by his work with surface-noise textures on <i>Bliss</i>. ""We Scarcely See Sunlight"" is driven by sparse layers that resemble someone bashing pipes in a dank basement, but it's the swirl of hiss around the sound that gives it an air of menace, with Kirby repurposing lo-fi for his own evil needs. On ""Ill Fares the Land""<span>—</span>a title that taps into the current horror fad for mining old English folklore for chills<span>—</span>he heads in the opposite direction and floods the track with sound, piling up chaotic layers of pistons to the point of combustion.</p>
<p>There's some beauty here, although it’s decidedly muted in tone. Kirby just leaves faint traces of it trailing through tracks<span>—</span>a spindle-thin keyboard riff, or a sample of strings rising and falling. <i>Dead Empires</i> isn't an album that deals in hope much, instead approaching the chaos and confusion of memory and scattering it into the open. There's something more human here than the work of, say, Raime, whose world is far colder than that of the Stranger. Kirby's fondness for disorder is a perfect fit for this type of material. Dream states rarely make sense until you plunge deep into them, and <i>Dead Empires</i> throws up thousands of different routes to get tangled up in on the way down there.</p></div>"|18686.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18686-the-stranger-watching-dead-empires-in-decay/|7.6|Nick Neyland

Both had brushes with mainstream success as MTV-approved alt-rock acts in the 90s. Both eschewed any laurel-resting and stretched those fleeting moments of pop-culture prominence into lengthy careers that have creatively eclipsed (or at least matched) their early work—so much so that they’re now known by many more for their output in the aughts than those angsty beginnings. Both have chipped away at that angst over the years, mellowing and polishing as they’ve matured. The pair’s new band, <a href=""http://minoralps.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Minor Alps</a>, is a predictable stroll along that same well-trod road, and their debut, <i>Get There,</i> files down any remnants of jagged alt-rock edges even further.</p>
<p>Caws and Hatfield have similarly thin but satisfying voices, and they blend remarkably well—so well, in fact, that they chose to double each other on almost every line of every song. There’s no sense of “This one’s his song” or “This one’s her song” on <i>Get There</i>. They co-wrote all the lyrics and played all the instruments, minus some drums. It’s a true collaboration. The vocal blend, though, is a little too perfect. Caws and Hatfield fortify each other’s shared strengths without filling in the gaps. At first it’s a fun novelty. Putting the singers in front of the mic at the same time, all the time, creates one mega-smooth vocal, but the subtleties that can only materialize when someone sings alone, out in front of a song, are lost.</p>
<p>Then there’s the formula factor. Minor Alps seem content to peddle pleasant but not particularly memorable pop-rock. Quiet verses lead into louder choruses with big drums and whitewashed guitars as Caws and Hatfield repeat a phrase that, depending on the song, becomes either more meaningful with each cycle (e.g. “Lonely low”) or collapses under the weight of repetition (e.g. “I don’t know what to do with my hands” and “If I wanted trouble I could find it”).</p>
<p>It’s never a good sign when a band sounds like they're in a rut on a debut, but the formulaic aspect alone doesn’t damn the collection. Some formulas work just fine. This one works well enough to be genial background music, but not enough to keep your ears cocked for 11 songs, especially when <i>Get There</i> is so lyrically spotty. “Maybe the phone will ring/ and then I’ll get to answer i-i-it” grates the most. It feels especially lazy and forced since the line doesn’t even need to rhyme. It’s hard to know why Hatfield and/or Caws didn’t rework i-i-it. There are other throwaways, too, like, “I really gotta get to you/ I really don’t know what to do.”</p>
<p>“Mixed Feelings” attempts to inject punk energy into the middle of the record to mixed results (a welcome change of pace yet still feels neutered), but the best parts of <i>Get There</i> are the mellow moments, which also tend to coincide with Minor Alps breaking up the anonymous guitar/drums/bass sounds with computerized beats and other digital detritus. Lead-off track “Buried Plans” initially got me excited about this record with its drum-machine groove, gorgeous harmonies, and loose structure. Caws channels Elliott Smith on the lovely fingerpicked, acoustic number “Maxon”, singing on his own (albeit briefly) about an amble to the store for a 9-volt battery, which turns into a meditation on transition and the pace of life. “I should hurry but I take my time,” he sings. “It keeps the panic level low.” An unhurried, casual nature is part of what makes <i>Get There</i>’s softer material pretty, but it could also be the thing holding Minor Alps back from writing truly great, uptempo rock songs. Upping the panic level and injecting urgency would help Minor Alps feel more like a rock band and less like a side project formed over afternoon tea.</p></div>"|18690.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18690-minor-alps-get-there/|4.9|Joel Oliphint

Gentle electric guitars duet around a distant drone, falling in and out and eventually adding a touch of menace just as a steady cymbal splash rises to meet them. The full kit kicks in, and the quintet holds steady for a moment. Then, in prototypical Skeletonwitch form, they rage, plowing delightedly headlong through an uneven mix of thrash, black, and death metals. “This darkness gives me reason,” growls Chance Garnette, his voice lathered with experience. “From this evil I draw strength.” Skeletonwitch swivel around a laser-edged riff and lean hard into chest-quaking, double-kick drum runs. Garnette continues with his perfect series of power-of-metal credos: “If I must go down, I will go down fucking hard,” or “Triumph only comes to those who possess the will/ to confront, annihilate the enemy.”</p>
<p>If all this sounds very serious, know that Garnette’s braggadocio scans more like a smile than a threat. (Remember: Their name is Skeletonwitch, which begs as much of a grin as a wince.) In fact, though <i>Serpents Unleashed</i> overruns with lyrics about “crush[-ing] the weak and feeble” and commands to self-immolate, Skeletonwitch seem to thrive on the fun they have as a band. Their mix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28432-immortal/"" target=""_blank"">Immortal</a> and Exodus, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26979-amon-amarth/"" target=""_blank"">Amon Amarth</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2144-iron-maiden/"" target=""_blank"">Iron Maiden</a> is nothing if not excitable, never more so than on this fifth record. This music has become their lifestyle, after all, the thing that’s kept them on the road most of every year for most of the last decade. “More Cruel than Weak” feels like an internal memo that’s been made public, a reminder to stay mean while smiling and vice versa. All of <i>Serpents Unleashed </i>seems to chase that aim: The dual, often-dueling leads of Scott Hedrick and Nate Garnette are zealous and excitable, with solos that shoot out like solar flares and synchronized leads that feel like well-timed high fives. The rhythm section is equally emphatic; drummer Dustin Boltjes, who stands out on his second album with Skeletonwitch, finds a groove and then abuses it, racing to add extra hits in unexpected spaces. During the early-album pairing of “I Am of Death (Hell Has Arrived)” and “From a Cloudless Sky”, he pivots from black metal sustains to classic hard rock patience, never forsaking the pneumatic precision that’s become a hallmark.</p>
<p>In the best way, Skeletonwitch have begun to flirt with artlessness, delivering their distillation with a chutzpah that makes you hope they never try anything else. Despite that consistency, Skeletonwitch have changed producers for each of their albums, working with grunge survivor Jack Endino for 2009’s <i>Breathing the Fire </i>and major label veteran Matt Hyde on their most recent album, 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15923-forever-abomination/"" target=""_blank""><i>Forever Abomination</i></a>. The results of those changes have been minimal; they sounded a bit slicker and streamlined on <i>Forever Abomination</i>, and they seemed to have a slightly wider stylistic range on its predecessor. “We show up ready to go,” Hedrick <a href=""http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2012/11/interview-skeletonwitchs-scott-hedrick/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">admitted to Invisible Oranges</a> late last year. “Typically very little gets changed in the studio.” But working with Converge guitarist and amplified egghead Kurt Ballou seems to have afforded Skeletonwitch’s sound extra depth. During the turnaround of “Beneath Dead Leaves”, for instance, Evan Linger’s bass pops like it never has before. The looming, mid-tempo throb that precedes the inevitable barrage of “Unending, Everliving” provides not only a break in the hyperactivity but shows that, for a band so locked into an approach, they can convincingly (even if only momentarily) push out of it, too. There’s more space between the guitars as well, giving the riffs and counters more room to work. These are simple touches, sure, but they stretch the bounds of Skeletonwitch just enough to notice.</p>
<p>Skeletonwitch have forever been known as a “live band,” a fitting if somewhat unbecoming turn for an act whose records have served mostly as advertisements for incredible live shows. On stage, Skeletonwitch are fun and somewhat jocular, a band that laces punishment with personality. In the studio, though, that’s generally been lost in the relentless of their 40-minute barrages. <i>Serpents Unleashed</i> doesn’t really amplify that aspect of the band, either, and their preferred form of power does occasionally blur into its own monolith. But it does add force and pacing, tweaks that help these 11 songs stand independently of the need to see them played live. That’s an added bonus, then, to Skeletonwitch’s familiar and unfussy sound. </p></div>"|18617.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18617-skeletonwitch-serpents-unleashed/|7.5|Grayson Currin

The solo guitar piece ""Calling Out of Work"" is closest to the Vile we recognize today—the chord progression is meandering and gently sad, the electric guitars at the top of the track trail occasionally into firefly wisps. It goes on, unnecessarily, for six minutes, but the late-summer-sky light rays of Vile's breakthrough <i>Hitmaker</i> peek through, in shafts and glints.

The sonic aesthetic she’s pieced together—a crackling experimental streak with potent pop hooks—is deeply pleasurable, and though she hasn't recorded anything as monumental as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15264-house-of-balloons/"" target=""_blank""><i>House of Balloons</i></a>, people have increasingly taken notice. It's unknown whether or not Solange was attempting to claim the credit she’s owed while curating her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52734-solange-announces-rb-compilation-featuring-cassie-kelela-sampha-jhene-aiko-more/"" target=""_blank""><i>Saint Heron</i></a> compilation, but listening to it, it certainly has that result. Although most of its songs are previously released, she’s assembled them into a coherent piece that transcends the usual odds-and-sods nature of the compilation format. It's an aesthetic manifesto of a specific corner of a rapidly expanding scene—the <i>Flex Your Head</i> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2105-no-new-york/"" target=""_blank""><i>No New York</i></a> of ambitious, minimalist R&amp;B that possesses considerable mainstream ambition and appeal.</p>
<p>Those loose parameters contain a broad range of sounds and styles. B.C. Kingdom’s album-opening “Lockup” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28578-kingdom/"" target=""_blank"">Kingdom</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15204-bank-head-ft-kelela/"" target=""_blank"">“Bank Head”</a> (featuring vocals by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31712-kelela/"" target=""_blank"">Kelela</a>, whose “Go All Night” also appears) both give off a stiffly robotic funkiness—the latter through a juddering bass synth, and the former via the tasteful application of <i>Robocop</i> noises. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31502-sampha/"" target=""_blank"">Sampha</a>’s “Beneath the Tree” is a jazzy piano ballad set to drum programming that combines elements of two-step, footwork, and Burial-style found-sound beats. Jade de la Fleur’s “Jaded” has the brutally stripped-down arrangement and smoky paranoia of a top-tier Tricky song. Spanish producer Pional's remix of South African artist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30631-petite-noir/"" target=""_blank"">Petit Noir</a>'s “Noirse"" clears away the comp’s nocturnal moodiness with bright, syncopated staccato melodies passed down from township music.</p>
<p>Despite their different approaches, the tracks all share a few basic commonalities: deep bass unimpeded by fussy arrangements, stoner-friendly electronic textures, and a willingness to borrow from pretty much any musical style that can project stylishly understated sexiness, whether it’s post-dubstep or 4AD-style atmospheric goth. Above all, these songs are also song-focused—the artists assembled here may all have deep experimental streaks, but they never ignore pop’s pleasure principle, and there are hooks all over the place on this near-flawlessly sequenced compilation.</p>
<p>Solange wrote and co-produced her own wryly titled contribution, “Cash In”, and the track's one of the most aesthetically conservative songs on the compilation, featuring a straightforward beat, a relatively lush arrangement, and the kind of gracefully building, inspirational melody that slow-jam R&amp;B hits are made from. It's the one song on <i>Saint Heron</i> that I could see getting radio rotation, a swaggering, graceful power move. It may have taken her a while to get to the point where she can pull such a gesture off, but in this insurgent territory, Solange reigns supreme.</p></div>"|18778.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18778-saint-heron/|8.1|Miles Raymer

And there you'd be, effectively on stage improvising in the eye of a violent noise jam with Pete Nolan going ape on his drums and former bassist Leah Quimby punching her bass beside you. You would’ve been apart of Magik Markers’ unformatted anti-songs, whose structure and shape could hardly be charted in the moment. They'd maybe make more sense later on one of the over 50 releases they put out on LP, cassette, and CD-R and hawked at the merch table after the show. There was a time when Magik Markers didn’t put much stock into the idea of “songs,” whether as a dialectical comment on performer vs. audience, as an act of political dissidence, or because they simply loved making noise music.</p>
<p>Truth is, they were just being honest. Read any interview with Ambrogio over the years, and one of the recurring themes is an all-eclipsing necessity to tell the truth with her music. Earlier this year, she <a href=""http://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/magik-markers?page=show"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>, “…telling the truth has the potential when done right to communicate a massive experience: the smaller and more precisely an honest human thing is rendered, is the more common it becomes.” This is somewhat tautological (few artists ride hard for “lying”), and it’s hardly a revelation in the big scheme of creating art, but the decade-long journey from the early days of Magik Markers to <i>Surrender to the Fantasy</i><i> </i>is largely about mapping how they express themselves as performers and songwriters. And while intentions can be dubious, what emerges in Magik Markers' first album in almost four years is their formerly hidden songcraft, at once small and precise.</p>
<p><i>Surrender</i><i> </i>has been fermenting on two-inch in the years following 2009’s <a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13004-balf-quarry/""><i>Balf Quarry</i></a>. Recorded partially in J Mascis’ Attic in Amherst, MA, partially at Ambrogio's dad’s basement in the band’s hometown of Hartford, CT, and at many East Coast practice spaces in between, the band takes the focused quality of their recent output and at long last adds warmth. For all the different environments that Ambrogio, Nolan, and new bassist John Shaw recorded in, they managed to sedate chaos into 45 minutes of form and shape. These are more “songs” like the band has been making since 2007's <a href=""pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10700-boss/""><i>BOSS</i></a>, but for semantic’s sake, the band hasn’t been writing “songs” since <i>BOSS</i><i> </i>so much as they’ve been better at whittling down what they’ve always done, being sure to leave all the knots and lathe marks in the final product.</p>
<p>They've finally and cautiously surrendered themselves fully to melody. Ambrogio opens the album on “Crebs” singing sweetly, “Everything about me feels so free” and the following songs stick pretty close to that sentiment. It's a natural step-though, and if you factor in Ambrogio’s bare songs as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16018-200-years-200-years/"">200 Years</a> (her collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3807-six-organs-of-admittance/"">Six Organs of Admittance</a>'s Ben Chasny) and the band's recent friendship with labelmates/tourmates/split-EP-mates <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/19365-sic-alps/"">Sic Alps</a>, the math checks out. “Mirrorless” has a cool desert look, riding on red-eyed fuzz and reverb, while the beautiful ""Young"" features little more than an acoustic guitar and a cello.<span> T</span>he tenor of these songs are a far cry away from when Ambrogio sang, “This gun was made to pull the trigger” in 2007. </p>
<p>All the violence and spit of early Magik Markers now manifests itself in subtler ways than broken amplifiers and feedback squalls. They dip into amphetamine-surf rock with ""Bonfire"", fully booted Neil Young explorations in ""Acts of Desperation"", and shredded Shaggs via closer ""WT"". The heart of the album, however, beats in the near-seven-minute treatise ""American Sphinx Face"". Like Patti Smith and Kathleen Hanna before her, Ambrogio's fearless stream of conscious delivery is a coil of surrealism, politics, and intense love. Whereas much of <i>Surrender </i>takes a more conventional lyrical approach (the pointed platitude of ""Youth"" goes, ""The worst part about being young/ Is thinking nothing ever comes”), Ambrogio's words on ""American Sphinx Face"" are delivered unsung, unadorned behind some proto-Markers psych-improvisation. ""I intend to be loved and see how it goes,"" she says dryly. As the noise of the song grows wider and wider, Ambrogio sharpens her tongue: ""In America every man is a king/ No good king but a dead king."" The towering song gives shape and meaning to the tender pieces that surround it.</p>
<p>The risk to explore more ""pedestrian"" forms—to lay bare songs into the common world of structure, hushed melodies, and harmonies—gives <i>Surrender </i>a varied topography. The tiny moments of vulnerability in Ambrogio's voice or Nolan's barely-there drumming are buoyed by their noisy nature and their surreal sketches. More than any Markers record before it, the trio seem to be communicating deep within the subconscious, tapping into soul that's been hiding behind the noise for years. <i>Surrender </i>could be viewed as a kind of acquiescence to plots and narratives, the kind Ambrogio was so opposed to when she started the band, back when chaos ruled. But to me this is leaning closer toward a more universal expression told in the Markers' own way—a set of honed truths that communicate on grand scales.</p></div>"|18700.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18700-magik-markers-surrender-to-the-fantasy/|7.9|Jeremy D.

From one perspective, Peryman’s music as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31756-fis/"" target=""_blank"">Fis</a> is an offshoot of the contemporary drum and bass scene, taking up a set of propositions set out by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31550-dbridge/"" target=""_blank"">dBridge</a> and Instra:mental’s Autonomic project at the turn of the decade and coming back with<i> </i>fascinatingly illogical conclusions. From another, Peryman is a singular figure whose avant-garde rhythmic constructs have converged only briefly with a wider movement.</p>
<p>Peryman’s activities so far have lent weight to the former theory. Discovered after handing a CD to the boss of New Zealand’s bastion of innovative drum and bass, Samurai Records, the producer has since released music on Samurai’s experimental sublabel, Horo, and dBridge’s Exit Records. His work tends to occupy the 170bpm tempo range common to the style, and explores, however obscurely, the same highly poised interzone between frenetic doubletime and its halftime counterpart. Often, too, his claustrophobic grooves bear traces of the DnB’s well-worn signifiers: the clipped snarl of a Reese bass, submerged echoes of ragga rudeness.</p>
<p>But the recent <i>Homologous</i> EP felt like Peryman was in the process of uncovering an altogether new rhythmic grammar. The producer has long ignored the quantizing function of his music software, preferring to work off-grid; lately, he says, his rhythms have been drawn from “what I hear and see from my body during meditation.” Appearing through Void Coms—a new label in which Peryman has a hand—and accompanied by an Yves Klein-derived manifesto about achieving a state that is “void of worldly influences,” the EP was still distinctively, inimitably FIS—but it was difficult to claim any link to drum and bass.</p>
<p>The appearance of Peryman’s latest, the <i>Preparations</i> EP, through Brooklyn label Tri Angle, further complicates matters. Suddenly it’s tempting to hear parallels with the darker fringes of the label’s trans-genre roster: Vessel’s scorched techno perhaps, or Howse’s dreamy footwork abstractions. Certainly, there is a forlorn melodicism to some of Peryman’s music which may initially have caught label head Robin Carolan’s ear—although it’s only a fleeting presence on the <i>Preparations</i> EP. </p>
<p>In fact, this EP hinges around a rather old FIS production, and one that finds him at his most conventional. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16133-dmt-usher/"" target=""_blank"">""DMT Usher""</a>, which received a vinyl-only release through Samurai Horo in 2012, is Peryman’s equivalent of a crowd pleaser, centred around a<i> </i>single downsliding bass tone that sputters and wheezes like<i> </i>a<i> </i>damaged strimmer. As always with a FIS production, the thrill is in the small things: the uncanny weft of the sounds, the micro-rhythmic push and pull of the percussion. But, arranged according to fairly rote build-and-drop dynamics, the track isn’t his most thrilling work.</p>
<p>Better is ""Mildew Swoosh"", which pushes that halftime-doubletime dichotomy to a breaking point: pulling one way is the scrabbling insectoid percussion and scintillating synth arp; against them, drifting, somnolent pads. But Peryman really thrives when he explores greater extremes of abstraction. ""Magister Nunns"" and ""CE Visions"" are ominous beasts, their grooves buried, protean, and beset by spumes of cavernous reverb. The former, in particular, seems to crumble as it hits the air, as if we’re hearing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17064-the-disintegration-loops/"" target=""_blank""><i>Disintegration Loops</i></a>-style tape degradation in time lapse. It makes for an exhausting listen, but since when was starting from scratch easy?</p></div>"|18734.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18734-fis-preparations-ep/|7.7|Angus Finlayson

The thing that'll gall most Lefties is that this album is all but absent of synths, which lends an unrelenting aggression. This isn't an new move; although their last record had a handful of great keyboard moments—the glitchy noise of ""Failed Olympic Bid"", the electronic blasts of ""Polymers Are Forever""—Future of the Left have been steadily moving away from the ""synth"" part of synth-punk for years now, refining the menace of the guitar/bass/drums setup. Apart from the acoustic reprieve on ""French Lessons"" or the gothic-country of ""Why Aren't I Going to Hell?"", <i>How to Stop Your Brain</i> is like a flurry of damning punches bludgeoning your face. It's their toughest, meatiest record to date.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Future of the Left's constant is Falco's voice, sung in an impish sneer, casting himself as the mischievous Puckish figure, the only one who knows what's really goin' on, though you are never sure what's sincere and what's sarcastic. Wit has always been part of Future of the Left's appeal, but it's also the kind of distancing sneer of someone you've always wanted to impress, but on some level, know you never will. The sneer of the smartest guy in the room.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Here, that humor is very much intact. On ""Singing of the Bonesaws"", Falco's vocal twists into the voice of a 1960s BBC newsreader, matter-of-factly reporting the decay of civilisation as if reporting the weather. Reportedly it was written in the span of a lunch-break and it sounds as much, playing out like a lucid stream-of-consciousness diatribe over a simple rhythm that shames just about everyone. But once it's beaten you into submission, you begin to feel capable of throwing a few punches of your own, and <i>How to Stop Your Brain</i> offers up one hell of a hit list: record companies, the music industry hype machine, the pedos who run the BBC and sleazy, aging DJs.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If the album has a coherent theme, it's laid out in the opening track: ""I'm just a man/ A simple thing."" The album has something to say about what it means to be masculine in 2013, and boy, men do not come off looking great. On ""Donny of the Decks"", the bruised meat of the issue is churned through the grinder of a slimy radio DJ well past his prime. Elsewhere, ""The Male Gaze"" asks ""The passing train has left me behind/ If you turn into an object on the second night/ Will my eyes get used to it? / Will your heart compete with it?/ After failure."" To talk about sex in these primitive ways—hunter and hunted, conquest and conquered—it's all so barbaric, but to deal with all the sex on here, you have to approach it on its own level.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album never really judges. Instead, it draws pathetic portraits of these sex-crazed worms and allows them to condemn themselves with their descent into sexual irrelevance. It's a particularly skilful form of torture and one Future of the Left do with frustrating regularity. They've all the trappings of a Band Who Could Be Your Life, from the name to their defiant energy to the state-of-affairs type lyrics. But their songs provide no model for a better society, no scripture, and no guilty verdict.  Even ""She Gets Passed Around at Parties"", a fairly straightforward story mirroring that 37-dicks scene from <i>Clerks</i> in which an insecure guy has to deal with his loved one's former promiscuity, doesn't make a call either way. Instead, Future of the Left know that we're all our own worst enemies, the most elegant engineers of our own miserable downfall, because we're the only ones who know how pathetic we truly are.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For however much of the album concerns itself with the festering axe wounds of our society and the confused lunks trying to crawl their way into 'em, it also doubles down on Future of the Left's trademark firebomb-throwing brutality. It's nasty and explosive and full of bile, a hard rockin' bare-knuckle blow to the temple that'll lay you flat out. In other words, <i>How to Stop Your Brain in an Accident</i> is just the thing for the modern man, those confused and angrily impotent brutes.</p></div>"|18683.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18683-future-of-the-left-how-to-stop-your-brain-in-an-accident/|7.4|Jake Cleland

The Barcelona producer's spent the last four years crafting and refining his own prismatic take on the dance sub-genre, fusing psychedelic sprawl with a sense of pop-like pacing in a way that has established his position as a crossover artist in an area of music that is typically a niche concern. Interestingly, his headier work has gained just as much, if not more, attention than his more streamlined material: ""Families"", his 2011 single with Los Angeles electro-pop auteur and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27809-glasser/"" target=""_blank"">Glasser</a> mastermind Cameron Mesirow, may be Talabot's most pop-refined cut to date, but it's ""Sunshine"", the hypnotizing 2009 single that served as his breakout moment, that still stands as one of his most widely beloved tracks.</p>
<p>Anchored around a sample of impassioned chanting that crests beautifully as tinkling bells swirl and lope around it, ""Sunshine"" bears resemblance to minimal techno legend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4505-ricardo-villalobos/"" target=""_blank"">Ricardo Villalobos</a>' masterful 2008 single ""Enfants (Chants)""—but that comparison could prove potentially misleading. What Talabot does isn't minimal, nor does he skew in the other, more boisterous direction; he's all about control, knowing when to let his vat of sounds gorgeously overflow and when to bring the pot down to a tight, focused simmer. Last year's astounding debut LP <i>ƒIN</i>, then, was a demonstration of his steady hand and mind, a jade-textured record that alternately—and sometimes, simultaneously—shimmered and pulsated with iridescent light.</p>
<p>Mixes don't always explicitly reflect a producer's artistic flair, but Talabot's entry in !K7's long-running <i>DJ-Kicks</i> series is different. An album-length stitchwork of euphoric moments and rich textures, the 75-minute mix proves that everything this guy touches can't help but turn mossy, earthy, groovy. Considering how much of this mix is other people's work reflected in Talabot's own visage, the overall continuation here of the sounds found on <i>ƒIN</i> is impressive and, for the impatient, quite handy. As Philip Sherburne noted in our review of that record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16249-fin/"" target=""_blank""><i>ƒIN</i></a> was the result of Talabot undergoing a nearly decade-long transformation as an artist, so who knows when we'll get the follow-up to that record—dance artists typically work in the singles format, so long-players typically are not a priority—which makes this <i>DJ-Kicks</i> mix a capable, reflective stopgap release.</p>
<p>In terms of selection, the mix is not too surprising taste-wise, a balanced breakfast of deep-house pulsers and percolating techno jams that keep the mood nice and steady. One track in particular, though, is worth highlighting for its revelatory nature: Mancunian dub-techno crawler Andy Stott's uneasy remix of British shoegaze outfit Maps' ""I Heard Them Say"", the first arguable peak that appears early in this <i>DJ-Kicks</i> installment. When I first heard this remix upon initial release, I was unimpressed—possibly because endless replays of Stott's commanding 2012 LP <i>Luxury Problems</i> has raised expectations for Stott-branded material a little too highly—but Talabot breathes new life into the track here, as it slithers and leaves a trail of glowing slime that sticks to the mix's opening third. The remix's inclusion also draws a previously unseen analogue between Stott and Talabot, two artists working with distinctly different approaches that nonetheless share a love for dipping their own contractions in layers of drowsy, clattery haze.</p>
<p>Artists from Talabot's Hivern label make appearances throughout, providing seemingly unreleased cuts and showcasing the collective's ear for glistening melodic dance music: Danish producer Round's ""Glass"" provides a particular moment of bliss with a classic structure and a slight sweep of tones, while Franc Sayol's Mistakes Are Okay project offers up the moody ""Night Watcher"" to serve as a darkly shaded interstitial cut. In the end, though, Talabot himself steals the show, bounding past <i>DJ-Kicks</i>' tradition of the compiling artist offering up an exclusive track by putting forth three new cuts he had a hand in.</p>
<p>There's ""Anagrama"", the tropical, woozy track from his and Genius of Time member Alexander Berg's Tempel Rytmik project, and the slyly anthemic ""Sideral"", a result of Talabot's team-up with Swedish producer Axel Boman (as Talaboman). The true stunner of the three, though—as well as possibly the big highlight on the mix—is Talabot's own ""Without You"", a big-room jam that wraps layers of shiny, winsome synth work around a muted vocal line like a barbershop pole. The track's yet another pristine example of Talabot's sense of pacing, as he dampens the beat midway through before bringing it back again to reinforce ""Without You""'s strong melodic backbone.</p>
<p>John Talabot's <i>DJ-Kicks</i> entry isn't the flashiest mix you'll encounter this year, and there's plenty of room for debate as to whether it ranks in the upper echelon of the series' many installments. Similar to <i>ƒIN</i>, though, it's an immersive experience that grows richer with every listen, as new details emerge from the throbbing green slurry that binds the tracks together. Talabot's ear for songs that walk the balance between trippiness and accessibility is his greatest gift, but this <i>DJ-Kicks</i> mix proves that his hidden strength is a keen sense of structure. The constant chug, a push-and-pull that gives as good as it gets, is not unlike pumping blood—and if you're in the right mindset, a deep listen to this solid collection will give you life, too.</p></div>"|18749.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18749-john-talabot-dj-kicks/|7.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

God wrote it.” From almost anyone else, that would come off ridiculous, a megalomaniac’s humblebrag, but from Hersh it’s part of the origin story, the one that’s been repeated in everything written about Throwing Muses from the 80s onward. Hersh has always held that she’s not a songwriter so much as a woman accosted by songs; her role, she says, is more like a transcriptionist, or a vessel. Anything an outside audience might hear in them, the story goes, is coincidental. But Throwing Muses’ music never sounded like it sprung from any outside source so much as one that’s deeply personal­­. The chords lurch like feelings would; and the lyrics make internal sense. A track like “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kJFm8-g0Bg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fish</a>” becomes far less surreal when you know that it’s referring to an actual fish nailed to an actual cross on Hersh’s actual apartment wall, but even then it’s like listening in on a few minutes of monologue, raw and untranslated, where the bits of dialogue, snippets of images, and the rest of the stuff of someone else’s inner life may well be a foreign language. There are plenty of Throwing Muses tracks that are oblique—and a lot more than the band gets credit for that are needle-direct—but few that explain themselves.</p>
<p>If this sounds at odds with finding a large audience, it’s because it is. Throwing Muses’ time on Warner in the 90s was neither pleasant nor lucrative. Hersh gave the label the rights to <i>Hips and Makers</i> to get out of her contract before releasing 1996’s <i>Limbo, </i>a title that now seems either prescient or biting. The Muses went on hiatus—or “disbanded,” which is both farther from the truth and closer to the practical reality. Hersh released solo albums on a fairly steady schedule, but Throwing Muses released only one more record: the triumphant <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8046-throwing-muses/"">Throwing Muses</a>. </i>That was in 2003. Hersh formed another project, 50 Foot Wave, around this time, but their last <a href=""http://www.kristinhersh.com/Releases/with-love-from-the-mens-room/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two</a> <a href=""http://www.kristinhersh.com/Releases/power-light/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">EPs</a> were released for free and quietly—as quietly, that is, as is possible for a band whose founding principle was “Throwing Muses, if they were faster, meaner and also swore a lot.” Hersh’s last solo album, <i>Crooked</i>, was self-released in 2009 nearly as quietly, supported mostly by house shows and smallish acoustic concerts. And though demos of <i>Purgatory/Paradise </i>existed online as early as <a href=""http://www.kristinhersh.com/cash-music-is-now/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2007</a> (a few were meant for <i>Crooked</i>), the audience they found was largely the same fans who crowdfunded the record. (Hersh was among the first to adopt the pay-what-you-want and subscription models Kickstarter and its ilk would later make inescapable.) While Throwing Muses did tour behind 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15781-throwing-muses-anthology/""><i>Anthology </i></a>compilation, it would have taken close attention to think new material was forthcoming.</p>
<p><i>Purgatory/Paradise</i>, as it turns out, is the Muses’ first album in 10 years, and “the work [the band] can die after releasing,” as Hersh jokes early in the commentary. (“We’re really looking forward to death. We work so hard to be allowed to die!”) But while 2003’s <i>Throwing Muses</i> was a comeback album in the familiar sense, roaring and tearing at all expectations from the first count-off, <i>Purgatory/Paradise </i>is more reserved. Of the Muses’ albums, it most resembles <i>Red Heaven </i>or <i>Limbo</i>, the forcefully aloof deep cuts of the Muses’ discography—but a shattered version, “like someone reached over our heads with a Looney Tunes mallet and slammed it into our record before we could stop him,” Hersh wrote. (Like <i>Crooked</i>, <i>Purgatory/Paradise </i>was devised both as a record and as a book, with essays by Hersh and art by Narcizo. It’s both a gorgeous standalone object—particularly the writing, considering 2010’s <i>Rat Girl </i>proved Hersh one of the best music writers around—and a sort of decoder for the album’s tracks.) Half of the album’s 32 tracks barely make it over two minutes. Some of them are reprises; sometimes the reprises come first. Some tracks are lopped-off bridges or choruses, or thoughts beginning with “and.” It’s even more disorienting for cuts like “Static” whose <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9MoGbbPaHM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">uncut versions</a> have been around long enough to memorize. This doesn’t necessarily seem odd for a band whose songs tend to skitter into <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1R8i38B7OU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">loping girl-group choruses</a> halfway or careen through <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsLm0ua-0-8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dozens of chords</a> that wouldn’t normally touch or scare-quote the entirety of some kid’s anarchy pamphlet <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReYu-qts2Dg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as an intro</a>, but <i>Purgatory/Paradise </i>really is unlike anything I’ve heard this year; it’s a little like someone read an old Muses review that talked about their songs switching gears, recorded what they thought that sounded like, then lost half the data to a defragmenting snafu.</p>
<p>Not that <i>Purgatory/Paradise </i>is difficult or inaccessible. The beginning fakes you out with the almost stately folk of “Smoky Hands”, but it’s just scene-setting before a song accosts you: a crash, then “Morning Birds”, an onslaught of shredding then pathos that’s as wrenching as anything on the first Muses record. “Sunray Venus”, the single, comes shortly after, and it’s as joyous as “Morning Birds” is visceral. Like Wild Flag’s “Romance”, it’s an exuberant ode to band chemistry that plays out like the Muses rediscovering all their hits (“leaving, that is limbo—hey, I remember you!”) and comes with a splashy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52765-video-throwing-muses-sunray-venus/"">video</a> full of wordplay and intertextual Easter eggs. Later on is “Sleepwalking”, a college-rock throwback where everything from the guitar lines to the glaze of the vocal processing seems imported from 1992. It’d be shameless if it weren’t so huge (and self-aware; the band calls it their “RC Cola song”), and it’s easy to imagine it on <i>Doolittle </i>or <i>Last Splash</i>—or for that matter <i>Throwing Muses </i>again; you can even trace out where Tanya Donelly’s harmonies would go.</p>
<p>But that’s the <i>second </i>version of “Sleepwalking” you hear: the first version is what would ordinarily be end of the song, a one-minute acoustic hangover. Songs come and go like this, or more specifically moments: bassist Bernard Georges’ sly lead on “Cherry Candy”, the spy riff and ballroom pirouette of a drum fill that introduces “Film” or the piano waltz it becomes halfway, the panflutes of “Folding Fire” (if any instrument’s unexpected on a Throwing Muses album, that would be it), certain melodies that recur or slip into the wrong tracks. The album, to its credit, rarely feels indulgent—only the two aimless “Curtains” stand out as possible edits—and the more you listen, the more a method emerges from the muddle.</p>
<p><i>Purgatory/Paradise</i>, more than any of Hersh’s records to date, is an album about loss, which might account for its fracturing. The closest thing to a traditionally built song is the bitterly determined “Milan”, about a neighborhood in New Orleans where Hersh's house was destroyed after Hurricane Katrina. Everything else is tentative: memories listed in order of disapperance. Sometimes the loss is literal, as in “Static”, written for a close friend who died; the arrangement tiptoes at first, then plunges straight into denial. Sometimes it’s almost funny: “Terra Nova”, about the Muses’ first breakup, is aimless and resigned, melodies delivered like shrugs, until it breaks out the “Bittersweet Symphony” strings. Sometimes it’s not funny at all, as on “Quick,” a song built uneasily atop a cello dirge, or “Bluff,” which is a curious lilting minute at first until its essay turns hazy into heartbreaking: “If you watch your friends carefully, sometimes you'll notice their features beginning to change: curling up into themselves, looking within rather than without, their senses dulled.” (The more I listen, the more it seems like a direct companion to “<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-2DwYIcC5w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Flooding</a>”, the saddest song Hersh has ever recorded.)</p>
<p><i>Purgatory/Paradise </i>isn’t an easy listen—expected enough from a band that’s repeatedly referred to the recording process as being “on a [desert] island"". If Throwing Muses didn’t explain themselves before, they’re certainly not doing so now, and for a comeback album, it’s so willfully at odds with any music consumption trend in 2013. Even as you imagine what these songs used to sound like, it’s hard to imagine actually listening to them that way, let alone shuffled in with anything else; its pieces are simply too small and elusive to listen to individually. They’d sound out of place on playlists, maybe bewildered in setlists. But as Hersh wrote to accompany “<a href=""http://www.kristinhersh.com/swollen/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Swollen</a>,” an album offcut (though the essay did become the introduction to the book), “It is not un-beautiful to be in pieces, as long as those pieces are fully realized.” It may be impossible for Throwing Muses to write anything that isn’t. </p></div>"|18660.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18660-throwing-muses-purgatoryparadise/|8.0|Katherine St. Asaph

But now that rock‘n’roll itself has become evermore disconnected from the contemporary popular-music landscape, the similarities between the New York and San Fran schools of late-60s psychedelia are more pronounced than the differences. Sure, the Velvets favored viscera over virtuosity, but they ultimately shared the same goal as their Pacific nemeses: to explode the parameters of the pop song through improvised, trance-inducing experimentation. But in case that connection isn’t explicit enough, we have <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5482-wooden-shjips/"" target=""_blank"">Wooden Shjips</a>, a band that, for the past six years, has been gradually folding the musical legacies of the east and the west, and the under- and overground, into one another. And <i>Back to the Land</i> marks the moment when they perfectly intersect.</p>
<p>The band’s fourth album heads further into the earthier direction of its 2011 predecessor, <i>West</i>, and casts even more radiant rays of Golden State sunshine onto the band’s once-foreboding hypno-drone-rock. Its eight songs still adhere to Shjips’ trusty game plan—get to the jam, stat. But if they’re sticking to the same procedural formula, they’re changing the inputs to achieve a more harmonious balance of light and dark, crossbreeding left-field figureheads with right-of-the-dial mainstays: the oscillating psych-blues swing of “Ruins” puts the Can in Canned Heat; “Ghouls” rides the Modern Lovers’ “Roadrunner” to the corner of Haight-Ashbury; “In the Roses” imagines Suicide headlining Monterrey; “Servants” flips the old rumor about Iggy Pop replacing Jim Morrison in the Doors by having the Lizard King front the Stooges.</p>
<p>However, the Shjips' firm grasp of their influences and inflexible M.O. essentially negates the possibility of this band ever really surprising you. All of these songs basically begin in full swing, and from the first moment, you can easily predict how they’re going to play out—formalities like verses and lyrics merely represent toll booths that are quickly bypassed en route to the open road. And yet, for a band that obviously wants to steer clear of pop-song structures, Wooden Shjips’ freewheeling guitar odysseys do little to disrupt or reshape their surroundings, and the more easy-going, smooth-sailing energy in effect here means the songs rarely make the leap from pleasant to powerful.</p>
<p>So it’s doubly ironic that the most conventionally rendered track on <i>Back to Land</i> is also its most revelatory: With the closing “Everybody Knows”, Wooden Shjips embark on their maiden voyage into melancholic (if still fuzzed-out) balladry, and it’s a rewarding one at that. As usual, frontman Ripley Johnson’s words are barely decipherable above the song's Crazy Horse haze, but the affecting, crestfallen feeling he invests in his performance cuts through loud and clear. Whether this breakthrough portends a change in course remains to be seen, but, at this point in their consistent-to-a-fault career, it's encouraging to hear Wooden Shjips draw the emotion out of their motion. </p></div>"|18720.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18720-wooden-shjips-back-to-land/|6.5|Stuart Berman

Sometimes it’s a small wooden cabinet filled with thimbles or spoons, or little magnets of all 50 states permanently fused onto the fridge door, or a binder full of basketball cards I can’t let go of just yet. For <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9328-cate-le-bon"" target=""_blank"">Cate Le Bon</a>, it may be something as simple as collection of coffee mugs that as time wears on becomes a museum on a shelf, endowed with tiny memories of the past. The Welshwoman sings on <i>Mug Museum'</i>s title track, “I forget the detail/ but remember the warmth.” </p>
<p>Le Bon’s understated and modest third album is in part a lament to the erosion of memories, all told with remarkable detail. These are small, graceful songs with deceptive amounts of depth, due in no small part to the circumstances surrounding writing the album. While in Wales last winter just as Le Bon was ready to move on from her 2012 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16179-cate-le-bon/"" target=""_blank""><i>CYRK</i></a>, her maternal grandmother died. The songs on <i>Mug Museum</i> were written during that time of reacclimation after grief, as Le Bon struggled with her loss and how affected her maternal role in her family.</p>
<p>Le Bon navigates these uncertainties with both poise and a kind of performed confidence, like someone just pushed her out on to the stage from the wings. Inspiration notwithstanding, it’s the most spritely album she’s released, though the songs themselves remain room-sized and unadorned. The band behind her, featuring guitarist H. Hawkline and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28957-white-fence"" target=""_blank"">White Fence</a> drummer Nick Murray, hit at some familiar folk garage signposts from her previous albums. Mostly, they're a tight, scrappy Euro beat band from the 60s held together by a dusty organ underneath, but sometimes they adopt more metro Television sound, or a carefree California psych group.</p>
<p>The main focus though is Le Bon, whose voice grows more and more singular and versatile with each release. The Nico comparisons still linger on perhaps only because the two are just biologically similar in their yawn-to-song delivery. But where Nico’s voice was alluring in a kind of siren way, Le Bon’s is more curious and diverse. Sometimes she sounds like the shyest member of a folksy sylvan choir and other times she rears up and belts out a high soprano note at the climax of “Duke”. These precise melodies are often performed without precision, or at least without consonants—something about her thick Welsh accent and tipsy elocution just makes her voice swirl around words rather than really land on them. When she sings, “split me like timber,” or, “beat me like egg yolks,” on “I Can’t Help You”, it’s less the emotion behind the sentiment and more the joy in hearing the words spill out.</p>
<p>And Le Bon revels in her language. For Le Bon, who is one of a small percentage of people in this world who can speak Welsh and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH93mp6ggeI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">frequently sings in it</a>, her love for words rarely feels ostentatious, and her gentle delivery rarely makes her words intrusive. There’s several simple turns of phrases on <i>Mug Museum</i> that are just captivating: the subtle transpositions in the chorus of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52068-listen-cate-le-bon-and-perfume-genius-i-think-i-knew/"" target=""_blank"">“I Think I Knew”</a>, sung in a classic duet format with the well-paired <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28685-perfume-genius/"" target=""_blank"">Perfume Genius</a>. There’s the tangled and desperate ""Mirror Me"" where she sings, ""Mirror me/ Like you want me to be/ Like I want you to see me"" (a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMeZCPbM6bA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">knowing inversion of Nico</a>, perhaps?). And there’s the emotional climax, “Sisters”, where Le Bon, now powerful in her lower register, proclaims, “I won’t die/ I’m a sister”, coated with denial and stuffed with subtext. We finally get a good look at her fear of mortality and sororal dread, and even then, it’s all boiling under her cool and collected voice.</p>
<p>The pen gets away from Le Bon a few times on the record, most notably on “Wild” where the band and Le Bon play with aggresive dissonance and purple prose, respectively. They don’t work especially well trying to fill spaces, they work better at sounding isolated in them. That’s what Le Bon does best: delicately amplify the tiniest moments that would otherwise go unnoticed. From H. Hawkline's erratic, trashy guitar on late-album psych highlight “Cuckoo Through the Walls”, to the creaking of the piano stool on the final track, <i>Mug Museum</i> accumulates hundreds of pieces of Le Bon's life to form an imperfect whole. By the end as Le Bon sings alone above a rusty piano, it sounds like she’s surveying the artifacts around her, her questions and worries laid out in great detail in the nine tracks that came before it. Most of <i>Mug Museum</i> is bare and direct, quaint and unassuming, but Le Bon makes a rather grand occasion out of it—<span>she's a </span>master curator and consummate immortalizer.</p></div>"|18716.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18716-cate-le-bon-mug-museum/|7.3|Jeremy D.

It can mean dependable, efficient, no-nonsense, consistent in quality. Given that work's the curse of the creative class, though, it can also mean boring, riffs-by-numbers, conventional, complacent. Atlana's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30150-whores/"" target=""_blank"">Whores</a> are definitely a “workmanlike” band, one that doesn't have a lot of fat and keeps things brief. So which definition do they fall under? Mostly the first—their latest album, <i>Clean</i>, is a set of songs influenced by AmRep, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5308-pissed-jeans/"" target=""_blank"">Pissed Jeans</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/"" target=""_blank"">the Melvins</a>. But it probably won't convert a lot of people over to noise rock: it's a standard noise rock record for people who already love the stuff.</p>
<p>Like their contemporaries in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30460-ken-mode/"" target=""_blank"">KEN Mode</a>, Whores are not afraid of low end. The bass, for instance, is the driving element of opener “Baby Bird”. That surprisingly hummable song was one of the tracks first released on the groups's Bandcamp page before the album came out—it's easy to see why. Even though he doesn't appear for 13 seconds, when bassist Jake Schultz comes, it feels like that's when the song actually starts. The bass also carries vocalist and guitarist Christian Lembach's verses of aspiring to be an urban threat. It's street-level creepiness that's part of noise rock's stark contrast to metal's tendencies towards fantasy and the esoteric. Another track, “Last Looks”, is defined by a bouncy, spidery bassline that also serves as the blood of the song. Schultz falls back on the rest of the album, and while those songs are not bad by any stretch, Whores are at their strongest when he takes the wheel.</p>
<p>“I Am Not a Goal Oriented Person” has strong Helmet overtones, with its crunchy main riff that, despite being on a record released in 2013, still sounds like it was too early to make an impact on hard rock radio. (Page Hamilton would be wise to have Whores write songs for him.) And while “I Am An Amateur At Everything” threatens to be just another stoner rock song, its verse riff has that nervous start-stop action that gives the song some extra energy.</p>
<p>So then, why is <i>Clean</i> a serviceable, not especially amazing record? Let's take a look at a few of the influences mentioned earlier. Pissed Jeans puts their humor front and center without being a “comedy rock” band. Whores could benefit for putting their perspective a little higher in the mix. Nobody can really be the Melvins—we're still figuring out how much of their success is persistence, and how much of it is that Buzz Osbourne and Dale Crover are freaks of nature who were meant for each other. KEN mode, perhaps the band whose shadow Whores live under the most, have that hunger and a willingness to tour (a lot) and endless ambition.</p>
<p>Honestly, the matches on <i>Clean</i>'s cover should be used to light a fire under someone's ass, because while this <i>is</i> a decent enough record, and Whores can clearly give a tune some life, they need a little more ambition to breathe life into this material. It doesn't push or expand the genre, and it doesn't feel like that's the point: it, more or less, feels like they wanted something to put on their merch table, and an excuse to ditch town for a week, and <i>Clean</i> is serving that purpose. Not the worst thing in the world, but also not the most inspired.</p></div>"|18687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18687-whores-clean/|6.4|Andy O'Connor

And yet there’s a place crucial to the band’s history that’s often left out of the narrative, probably because it doesn’t make for the most exciting <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgPUqMQU7Vk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rock Band</i> backdrop</a>: BBC Radio studios. The lasting images of Beatlemania are ones of constant motion: of airplanes and tarmacs, of screaming teens chasing the band down the high street, of limousines that act as decoys for other limousines. But in the midst of all that hysteria, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"" target=""_blank"">the Beatles</a> managed to record 52 BBC radio programs over the course of 1962 to 1965, and though they were mostly born out of promotional obligations, the frequent shows allowed the band to engage with their fanatical fans from a safe distance. The BBC was where The Beatles could perform for an audience of millions without struggling to hear themselves sing over primitive concert-hall P.A.s, and where—via mailed-in requests—they could interact with their many admirers without worrying about being trampled by the mob.</p>
<p>This much was evident on 1994’s <i>Live at the BBC</i> compilation, which functioned as a hermetically sealed time capsule of the Fab Four at their most innocent and fun-loving. The only evidence of the intense pressure the band were under at the time could be gleaned from the tracklist—with demand for new Beatles recordings far outstripping supply, the band’s BBC playlists were stacked with as many Reeperbahn-tested covers as Lennon-McCartney originals. <i>Vol. 2</i> offers a similarly proportioned mix, with the now-familiar variations in fidelity that go with it. And it actually works within an even tighter timeframe than its predecessor, which reached far enough into ’65 to feature the proto-psychedelic jangle of “Ticket to Ride.” <i>Vol. 2</i>, by contrast, sticks to 1963-64; the tracklist reaches as far as <i>Beatles for Sale</i> cuts “I’ll Follow the Sun” and “Kansas City/Hey-Hey-Hey!” but stops short of showcasing the more reflective, emotionally invested songcraft that would define that album, and the Beatles catalogue from that point forward.</p>
<p>Like most sequels, the new compilation presents a case of diminishing returns: where the first BBC collection yielded 30 songs that never surfaced on any of the Beatles’ proper albums, the new set features but two (in the form of Chuck Berry and Tony Orlando covers) and about one third of the tracklist overlaps with the first set (albeit with the recurring tracks pulled from different sessions). But, approached on its own terms, <i>Vol. 2</i> is still a pleasure to behold. While it’s designed to evoke a bygone era when congregating around the living-room radio was British-household ritual, the grab-bag sequencing and strategically stitched between-song banter lend the collection a frenetic, cut-and-paste momentum that’s remarkably attuned to modern listening habits.</p>
<p>Here, the Beatles sound less like legends-in-the-making than four school chums goofing off on an extended holiday, giving shout-outs to various Liverpool landmarks, playfully jousting with their straight-man hosts, and accepting offers of jam butties from listeners. And, further to this demystifying process, the recordings serve as a reminder that, like any aspiring group, the Beatles were initially a sum of obvious influences: the dirty lo-fi rip through “I’m Talking About You” serves as a test run for “I Saw Her Standing There”; a winsome rendition of Buddy Holly’s “Words of Love” points the way to “Do You Want to Know a Secret"" And yet, when you hear the band’s obvious affections for 50s hot-rod rock ‘n’ roll and Everly Brothers-style harmony-folk collide into perfectly formed pop salvos like “She Loves You"", “From Me To You"", and “I Want to Hold Your Hand"", it’s still hard to believe such a pure, crystalline sound could be produced by four exhausted guys playing live off the floor into mono mics. These songs may not form the basis for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9669-love/"" target=""_blank"">Cirque du Soleil revues</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43aLbo-Y_W0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">elaborate jukebox musical films</a>, but, as fans from <a href=""http://www.3ammagazine.com/litarchives/2002_feb/interview_billy_childish.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Billy Childish</a> to <a href=""http://nirvana.wikia.com/wiki/Kurt_Cobain's_Top_50_Albums"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kurt Cobain</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/5-10-15-20/9207-franz-ferdinand/"" target=""_blank"">Alex Kapranos</a> have attested, there’s a case to be made that The Beatles peaked as a band in 1964. </p>
<p>In the absence of a rare-cuts windfall, <i>Vol. 2</i>’s most novel attraction is a series of one-on-one interviews conducted with each individual band member over the course of 1965-66, a good year removed from their most breakneck period. But beyond all the deliciously prophetic anecdotes—John pondering the place of politics in his life, George positing that the future of music lies in more sophisticated production, Paul recounting his experience attending a Stockhausen gig—the interviews are emblematic of a moment when not only were the Beatles maturing, so too was the very medium of music journalism; while the interviews are dotted with celebrity-tabloid-level queries like “how big is your house?” the conversations eventually drift into deeper ruminations on familial responsibility and, given the expected short shelf life of pop groups at the time, what the lads plan to do when the Beatles go bust. But even when faced with this more personal line of questioning, the Beatles sound as relaxed, confident, and in their element as when they were knocking out “There’s a Place” or “The Hippy Hippy Shake” earlier in the set. Though The Beatles’ regular BBC visits would become much less frequent as the band embarked upon their most sonically adventurous phase, these sessions underscore the impetus behind it: this band was always so much more comfortable in the studio than on the road.  </p></div>"|18752.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18752-the-beatles-on-air-live-at-the-bbc-vol-2/|7.2|Stuart Berman

They have two live shows, one a straight rock set, the other an elaborate, theatrical staged event featuring costumes and projections. Their image embraces both hemispheres of their heritage. And most importantly, their music itself has a dual nature, existing in a space between subtlety and overload, melody and noise.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Their impressive<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16097-yamantakasonic-titan/"" target=""_blank""> 2011 debut</a> was billed as a warm-up for a full-fledged rock opera, and where a lot of claims like that are quietly forgotten as a band gets into the swing of touring and making a follow-up, Y//ST actually came through, debuting the opera, titled <i>33</i>, last year in Toronto. They may yet make an album out of it, but for the moment, we get <i>UZU</i>, another compact, heavy album of what the band cheekily calls “Noh-wave” after the Japanese drama style and the 80s downtown New York art music scene. It’s common for the band to be labeled prog rock, and that’s true if we take prog to be shorthand for “unabashedly ambitious and conceptually rich,” but there are threads of post-punk, metal, and East Asian pop music running through it as well; the mix is unique enough that the band’s own term might be the most accurate label.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">If there’s a way in which <i>UZU</i> falls short of the band’s debut, it’s in the recording itself, which is a bit hazier this time out and consequently robs the music of some of the direct, visceral power it had on <i>Yamantaka // Sonic Titan</i>. That said, the songs and performances are good enough that it nearly doesn’t matter. If anything, they’ve broadened their range, and Alaska’s drumming still hits like a ton of bricks. Attwood’s sweet, melodic singing works as a potent foil to the music; picture Enya lost in a dark forest populated by carnivorous trees and you’ve just about got the sound of it.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The band works the central tension in their music skillfully. “Atalanta” is the fragile prelude to “Whalesong’s” monumental beat, “Seasickness pt. 1” provides a calm before the whirlwind of “pt. 2”, and the propulsive, wordless chanting and fuzz bass of “One” is balanced by the broken-down, psychedelic wash of album postlude “Saturn’s Return”. This attention to flow makes the album feel complete, and for a record with so few intelligible lyrics to feel like such a coherent statement is not a small achievement. Then again, this is a band that probably won’t ever do anything small, and they’re all the better for it.</p></div>"|18771.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18771-yamantaka-sonic-titan-uzu/|7.8|Joe Tangari

Look at the album’s cover illustration and you’ll see an angel-like creature carrying an orb of yellow light through the clouds; open the gatefold and you’ll see what appears to be a bird made of stars launching itself out of the ocean. Press play and be delivered into over two hours of mind-numbingly mellow music with titles like “Unicorns in Paradise” and “Tien Fu: Heaven’s Gate”. The structures are simple and the textures are light. Focusing too hard on it is like trying to remember a dream you just had: It will do nothing but piss you off. But like the right color paint on the walls or a thoughtful arrangement of lamps, good new age music feels both peripheral and essential: Something made not to be focused on as much as to remind people listening to it that focusing is only one way to experience the world.</p>
<p><i>Center</i> starts in 1950, about 25 years before the term “new age” existed in any kind of widespread way, and leads up to 1990, when the genre had devolved into factory-like repetitions of itself. (Steve Vining, who took over the pioneering label Windham Hill from its founder Will Ackerman, once said that running it was more like running Proctor &amp; Gamble than running a record label.) The picks here focus on private presses: Essentially, DIY labels operating outside conventional channels of marketing and distribution. If there’s any argument being made by Light in the Attic here, it’s that new age wasn’t just a multimillion-dollar industry engineered to relax middle-aged Americans rich enough to afford CD players in 1982 (when they cost the equivalent of about $1,600), but an underground scene as self-reliant and countercultural as the ones surrounding newer labels like Oneohtrix Point Never’s Software or Los Angeles’ Not Not Fun—labels whose artists have recast aspects of new age as a form of punk, or what Lopatin once called “quiet noise.”</p>
<p>Like any genre, the sound of new age varies. Some of the tracks here are acoustic; some are all electronic. Some—like the keyboardist Stephen Halpern or Brian Eno collaborator Laraaji—suggests a quiet, person-to-person connection that way a folksinger with a guitar might. Others—a like Iasos and Constance Demby—make cavernous music seemingly designed to remind us that we are but specks of dust in a cosmos too awesomely infinite for our mortal brains to ever possibly comprehend. (Iasos insisted that his first album was not made by him but <i>through</i> him; Demby once invented an instrument called the “space bass” that she has described as “a transdimensional communication device”—gestures that both assert new age ideas about spirituality but also reassert very old-fashioned ones about how the self can dissolve when it comes into contact with the sublime.)</p>
<p>Personally I prefer the less grandiose stuff, but the variety of <i>I Am the Center</i> is one of its best attributes: Instead of pigeonholing the genre by turning it into something overly specific, <i>Center</i> shows how artists with totally different approaches to sound and style can still be grouped together. Crucially, it does this without trying to stretch the Venn diagram of new age to include artists or styles with more cultural cache, like 70s classical composition or drone—music that shares new age’s interest in spirituality and repetition but that tends toward an intensity that, in the context of new age, seems damningly unchill. What you end up with is a compilation that stays true to its genre while also doing everything it can to demonstrate how varied that genre can be.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I suffered intense anxiety problems, which my mother tried to help me combat with a variety of cures: Exercise, homeopathic medicine, counseling, religion, and eventually, new age music. While other kids were being subjected to the Beatles on car trips, I lay on the carpeted floor of my room listening to cassettes with titles like <i>Celestial Journeys</i> and <i>Inner Sanctum II: Reclaiming the Inner Sanctum</i>. A few years later, when I started to get into punk and hardcore, I realized the best new age music wasn’t all that different: There was a similar purity of purpose, a similar rejection of societal values, and a similar unwillingness to bend, either toward more concrete rhythms—which can sometimes turn new age into chintzy, synth-heavy instrumental pop (e.g. the ubiquitous Kitaro)—or toward more complex compositions that might have leant their makers credibility but compromised the essentially relaxing quality that good new age promised never to disturb.</p>
<p>Still, I write this knowing that new age is among the most easily ridiculed genres of music that exists. Its practitioners can be somehow pretentious and weak-minded, ludicrously abstract and yet as sure of their discoveries as a scientist. “Music helps to concentrate oneself,” the liner notes to <i>I Am the Center</i> start. “To bring oneself to an inner state when we can assume the greatest possible emancipations. That is why music is just the thing which helps you too see higher.” The words—a quote from Thomas de Hartmann—say it all, which is to say that they don’t really say anything. Then comes the voice of Yoga Records founder and <i>Center</i>’s compiler, <a href=""http://waxidermy.com/features/pina-lecture-by-douglas-mcgowan/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Douglas Mcgowan</a>: “So many declarative statements to make on the subject of new age, and so little time. And yet,” he goes on, “we do have the time, and the best new age music shows us this.” It’s the kind of subtle, canny move new age acolytes aren’t exactly known for making: Accepting the occasional goofiness of what they do while reasserting its value at the same time.</p></div>"|18655.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18655-i-am-the-center-private-issue-new-age-music-in-america-1950-1990/|8.3|Mike Powell

Fewer listeners still know that since then he’s proven himself to be one of the only guitar heroes of the time who has fully embraced and adapted to the new technologies and techniques of the modern digital era. The album Medicine released earlier this year, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18320-medicine-to-the-happy-few/"" target=""_blank""><i>To the Happy Few</i></a>, was the first Laner recording I’d heard since 1995’s <i>Her Highness</i>, and while it stayed true to the fundamental sheets-of-guitar-noise spirit of the band’s earlier stuff, Laner’s production work (he’s produced all of the band’s albums) seemed heavily influenced by contemporary electronic music, and helped make the album a happily surprising success.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Laner’s well-regarded as a guitarist, but while he’s technically virtuosic, what he plays tends to pale in comparison to what he does to the signal leaving the instrument’s pickups. During Medicine’s first run that was running it through chains of overblown distortion and delay effects. Since then he’s expanded into digitally manipulating the sound, chopping it up and glitching it out in ways that resonates with the twitchier edges of the dance music scene. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Eno</a>, who he’s worked with in the past—and whose influence would be easy to pick up on anyhow—Laner combines an appreciation of rock’s formal outlines with a compulsion to fill them with the most whacked-out futurist noises he can make.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Considering the way that Medicine has always prioritized texture over melody, you might expect Laner’s solo material to push even further out than his primary project. However, <i>Nearest</i><i> Suns</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, like his previous two solo outings, draws its inspiration from the peak of rock’s baroque psych-pop days, with </span><i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> and </span><i>Pet Sounds</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> looming large over most of its songs. On “Nearly Hospital High,” he recreates the way that some of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5301-paul-mccartney/"" target=""_blank"">Paul McCartney</a>’s <i>Sgt. Pepper’s</i>-era material sounds like a swinging, big-band pop number just barely able to keep its head above a torrent of psychedelic flourishes. With its base of handclaps, hand drums, and acoustic guitar topped by multitracked vocal harmonies and backwards electric guitar licks, the album opener “Be Gone” feels like a campfire singalong with a cheerful hippie acid cult, but the computer-precise sequencing of the rhythmic elements and the squelching guitar distortion flickering between the speakers also adds an unexpected ravey element.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Stylistically, it’s well-trodden ground that Laner’s covering here. <i>Sgt. Pepper</i>’s and <i>Pet Sounds</i> have formed the bipartite god to several consecutive generations of psych-pop auteurs, and even the slightly transgressive tactic of contrasting their fairly well-mannered melodies and harmonies with intensely ugly distortion has been done pretty much to death. But Laner’s a decent songwriter, and even the compositions that don’t really work, like the Tropicalia excursion “Summer Rudder"", are worth hearing just for their production, which in this case involves chipper analog synth sequences set against fractally fuzzed-out guitar leads.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Nearest Suns</i> gets more interesting when it takes its attention away from psych-pop’s Big Two and some of the self-consciously retro flourishes that they entail. The best song on the record is also its simplest, composition-wise. “Equals Sky” has just one droning chord that shifts between acoustic guitar arpeggios, Laner’s vocal harmonies, and heavily modified electronic noises that at times resemble a tape delay on the fritz. Behind the spare melodic elements there’s a weird rhythmic part consisting of some kind of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6215-john-cage/"" target=""_blank"">John Cage</a>-like prepared drum fed into a sampler and chopped up into an unstable loop that constantly seems ready to collapse. Without Laner’s production there isn’t much to the song, but the way he arranged and recorded it gives the track the feel of a musician and his gear in a tight symbiotic relationship, all falling apart together.</p></div>"|18723.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18723-brad-laner-nearest-suns/|6.3|Miles Raymer

Every stumbling drum fill, fuzz blurt, vocal affectation, and slightly detuned guitar chord on <i>As Plantas Que Curam</i> is the sound of two boys punching psych-pop in the arm, tipping its chair back with their feet because they're mad they can't stop thinking about it. </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Their spirit remind you of another breakout 2013 band with a goofy name: The currently-beleaguered, possibly-shipwrecked </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30523-foxygen/"" target=""_blank"">Foxygen</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, whose still-great </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17552-we-are-the-21st-century-ambassadors-of-peace-magic/"" target=""_blank""><i>We Are The 21 Century Ambassadors of Peace and Magic</i></a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> did a similar pirouette between mockery, pastiche, and loving tribute. Like Foxygen, the kids in Boogarins have spent several years in thrall to the sounds of 50-year-old records, and they have also self-recorded their efforts, paying close attention to how they might achieve the just-right abraded sounds.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">That they assembled an album that sounds </span><i>this</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> good while working in their parent's basements says a lot about their talent. They have good taste in other people's records, but they also have the innate musical smarts to pull similar sounds out of their own: </span><i>Boogarins </i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">is rich, heavy, and sonorous, the guitar tones sensually warm and the vocals and drums sent through several treatments to blur them and lift them off the ground. On ""Eu Vou"", the vocals swim through liquid silence, tiny rippling mouth pops and a faraway synth the vocal track's only distant companions. It might be their tribute to </span><i>Marble Index</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">-era Nico; it channels a similar empty vastness.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Almeida and Ferraz are Brazilian, and it is impossible to listen to the album' opening track, from its title of ""Lucifernandis"" to its gonzo, slightly out-of-time opening riff and not think ""Os Mutantes."" That group's gently antic spirit, and their secret sweet-tooth genius with pop melodies, presides over Boogarins like a loony-uncle figure who won't ever quite leave the garage.  There are a million other little touches of songwriterly wit and grace on the album, imported from other sources: the quote of the Kinks' ""Lazy Old Sun"" that strings together ""Hoje Aprendi de Verdade"", the lift of what appears to be the guitar line for Wilco's ""I'll Fight"" on ""Doce."" Almeida and Ferraz know good melodies when they hear them. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Even when they borrow material, though, they use the quotes like jumping-off points, self-imposed challenges to craft their own memorable songs around them.  Their ear for melody is much stronger and more sophisticated than most bands their age—the sleepy guitar line winding through ""Erre"" has been restarting itself endlessly in my mind ever since I heard it. Even their one-minute-long, doodled sound experiments, like ""Canção Perdida"", float by on a pretty melody. There is a sense that the classic-rock heritage they are wading around in is a big, thrilling game to them, each song a Sudoku puzzle for their songwriting. There is a goofy, loose feel to <i>As Plantas Que Curam</i></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, but it's a feint. Almeida and Ferraz aren't goofs; they're connoisseurs.</span></p></div>"|18652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18652-boogarins-as-plantas-que-curam/|7.1|Jayson Greene

Many are teens. A disproportionate amount are gay, lesbian, or transgender, shunned by their families or the world at large. Some close their eyes under trees in Central Park. Some sell sex downtown. Others go underground and lean their heads on the dulled metal of subway trains traveling along the ACE line, from the top of Manhattan to the bottom of Queens. According to <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/12/10/121210fa_fact_aviv"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Netherland""</a>, a harrowing <i>New Yorker</i> story from last year that chronicled the city's young, homeless, LGBT underground, the ACE is known to some lodgers as ""Uncle Ace's house."" This comforting nickname provides the title and inspiration for ""Uncle Ace"", a key track from singer/songwriter/producer Devonté Hynes' second album as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29639-blood-orange/"" target=""_blank"">Blood Orange</a>. </p>
<p>Starring the kind of battered-but-resilient souls who stroll through the city in the dead of night, the impressionistic song has Hynes switching between a low and high singing voice, subtly accentuating the androgynous characters within. It's mysterious, desperate, empathetic. ""Not like the other girls,"" he offers, possibly taking the purview of a woman who feels like a man, or vice versa. Hynes shines a careful light onto his vulnerable subjects, inhabiting their travails with grace, all while a disco pulse and smoky saxophones harken back to his beloved 80s, when Times Square was a misfit's home away from home. The outcasts that live inside of ""Uncle Ace"" are Hynes' people. As the London-raised, New York-based 27-year-old has hopped from project to project and style to style over the last 10 years, he's maintained the air of an outsider. With <i>Cupid Deluxe</i>, he channels those vagabond emotions into something universal and inviting—an album that tenderly details various heartaches through the language of longing. </p>
<p>Growing up, Hynes was bullied and beaten up enough to end up in the hospital on more than one occasion. He first directed his angst into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4389-test-icicles/"" target=""_blank"">Test Icicles</a>' spazzed punk as a teen before moving onto <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"" target=""_blank"">Morrissey</a>-style tragic confessionals with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5626-lightspeed-champion/"" target=""_blank"">Lightspeed Champion</a>. His first album as Blood Orange, 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15722-coastal-grooves/"" target=""_blank""><i>Coastal Grooves</i></a>, traded in Lightspeed's orchestral folk-pop for slick new wave and funk, streamlining his once-unwieldy songwriting in the process. But it wasn't until he co-wrote and produced two songs from last year—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26010-solange/"" target=""_blank"">Solange</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14364-losing-you/"" target=""_blank"">""Losing You""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30673-sky-ferreira/"" target=""_blank"">Sky Ferreira</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14138-everything-is-embarrassing/"" target=""_blank"">""Everything Is Embarrassing""</a>—that he found the most suitable vessel for his melancholic odes to expired love. Both tracks are propelled by springing 80s beats that are tugged down by minor chords and wounded lyrics; the upbeat drums suggest good times past, making the reality-check vocals hit that much harder. Given the blaring nature of modern pop, the subtlety of these hollowed-out songs was genuinely refreshing; not just ""indie"" for the sake of it, but affectingly human.  </p>
<p><i>Cupid Deluxe</i> largely (and winningly) follows the formula set forth by those modest hits, while bringing them forth on a full-length scale. Across the album, Hynes sings, writes, produces, and plays guitar, bass, keyboards, drums, synths. But this is hardly a solo act. In fact, one of the record's greatest strengths lies in its pitch-perfect deployment of guests. Not only does each member of the <i>Cupid Deluxe</i> team seem to fully understand the overarching wistfulness of the whole, but many of them show off heretofore unheard facets of their talent. While Hynes' girlfriend and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30016-friends/"" target=""_blank"">Friends</a> frontwoman Samantha Urbani and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28205-kindness/"" target=""_blank"">Kindness</a> leader Adam Bainbridge exhibited tentative skills with their respective groups' debut albums last year, they make the most of their spotlights here; Urbani often sounds like she's mimicking the sultry chirpiness of an absent Solange, but her clear chemistry with Hynes makes the substitution more than adequate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Projectors</a>' David Longstreth and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10351-chairlift/"" target=""_blank"">Chairlift</a>'s Caroline Polachek have never sounded more soulful. Typically ominous rap producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a> contributes light, skittering drums to the Longstreth showcase ""No Right Thing"", which could fit snugly into any <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">Vampire Weekend</a> setlist. Even the set's two rap cameos, from Queens' Despot and London's Skepta, are anything but your usual in-and-out 16-bar guest shots—both MCs are given plenty of space to weave tales that are tactile and intimate, while Hynes' vocals take on a more ghostly role on the tracks' edges. And while the inclusion of a bubble-funk remake of Britpop curio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2668-mansun/"">Mansun</a>'s pompously overwrought 2000 single <a href=""http://youtu.be/mEWFigyE8R0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Can Only Disappoint U""</a> sounds almost comically random on paper, Hynes' <a href=""http://youtu.be/mHoCR7u5NzY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fat Boys scratches</a> and Urbani's featherlight vocals make it fit into the album's loose after-hours milieu. Such awareness and selflessness consistently pays off, making all involved sound that much better.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Especially Hynes, who's in complete control. Each drum machine snap, snippet of errant barroom chatter, Malcolm McLaren sample, and moist-eyed, questioning chorus snaps together to form a midtempo mixtape for the high-school dance you never had. The first-blush glances. The slowed mirrorball twinkle. The push and pull. ""Baby are we on the line/ Tell me baby are you mine?"" he sings, knowing full well that if you have to ask the question, you probably know the answer.  </p>
<p>Like many Manhattan iconoclasts before him, Hynes holds director Jennie Livingston's 1990 documentary of NYC gay and transgender ball culture, <a href=""http://youtu.be/78TAbjx43rk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Paris Is Burning</i></a>, very dear. While everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2637-madonna/"">Madonna</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27895-lady-gaga/"">Lady Gaga</a> has taken inspiration from these events—one of the few safe havens for participants to revel in their true selves without having to worry about the judging eyes of society—they often focus on their more outrageous or empowering aspects (see: <a href=""http://youtu.be/GuJQSAiODqI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Vogue""</a>). But Dev Hynes' music is more suited to the film's beautiful and wrenching quiet moments, like when transgender model <a href=""http://youtu.be/UJe0RMnf4vk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Octavia Saint Laurent</a> confesses her desire to ""be somebody"" or is seen worshipping cut-outs of supermodels taped to the walls of her bedroom. The message comes full-circle on the Michael Jackson demo of a closing ballad, <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/news/52953-video-blood-orange-time-will-tell/"">""Time Will Tell""</a>, which repurposes some of Hynes' own lines while a refrain of ""and it keeps on running back"" underlines the repetition. Gay, straight, man, woman, black, white, or anywhere in between: Heartbreak is real. It won't stop.</p></div>"|18736.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18736-blood-orange-cupid-deluxe/|8.5|Ryan Dombal

So as not to muddy things, Paul Westerberg gave Dunlap a new nickname: Slim. Thus the legend of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1168-slim-dunlap/"" target=""_blank"">Slim Dunlap</a>, “the replacement Replacement,” was born. But that admittedly minor legend—plus the shadow of Stinson, who died in 1995—has obscured a couple of significant facts: First, the Replacements’ albums with Dunlap might not have that ol’ Bob fire, but they’re largely excellent. Second, Dunlap was an experienced, even pioneering guitarist and songwriter on his own long before pushing a broom around First Avenue that fateful day in 87.</p>
<p><i>Songs for Slim: <i>Rockin’ Here Tonigh</i></i>t is a new 2xCD tribute to Dunlap’s music—that is, his work outside the Replacements. In an ideal world, such a compilation would come about simply because Dunlap is Dunlap. Sadly, though, its impetus is less happy: In 2012 the notoriously sweet and humble guitarist suffered a debilitating stroke. The Replacements came out of retirement to raise funds for Dunlap’s medical bills with their <i>Songs for Slim</i> EP—which in turn led to a full Replacements reunion, understandably without Dunlap, this summer. But <i>Songs for Slim </i>is a more sprawling affair. First released as a series of singles, this new collection expands that selection of Dunlap covers, and the roster is formidable: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4314-jeff-tweedy/"" target=""_blank"">Jeff Tweedy</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4600-lucinda-williams/"" target=""_blank"">Lucinda Williams</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1283-steve-earle/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Earle</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/381-frank-black/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Black</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7532-craig-finn/"" target=""_blank"">Craig Finn</a>, Jakob Dylan, John Doe, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2015-patterson-hood/"" target=""_blank"">Patterson Hood</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2585-lucero/"" target=""_blank"">Lucero</a>, Soul Asylum, and the Replacements themselves are among the featured artists. That such a staggering array of moving parts came together so relatively soon after Dunlap’s stroke is a testament not only to the love the music community has for him, but to the of gumption of Peter Jesperson, co-founder of Twin/Tone, the indie label that housed both the Replacements and Dunlap’s rootsy new-wave band, the Spooks, in the early 80s.</p>
<p>The Spooks are represented here, but only by one track: “Laugh It Up (It’s All a Big Joke Anyway)”. The 1978 original is a Gram Parsons-esque pub-rock number, but it’s given a rousing strip-search by Peter Holsapple of the dB’s—and the plucky arrangement spotlights just how essentially adaptable Dunlap’s work has always been. By contrast, “The King &amp; Queen”—a cut from Dunlap’s first solo album, 1993’s <i>The Old New Me</i>—is given the loud treatment by Frank Black, who hoots across a stomping, bar-rock backing track by the Suicide Commandos, another one of the Spooks’ old-school Twin/Tone contemporaries. Patterson Hood’s version of “Hate This Town” and Steve Earle’s version of “Times Like This” are nearly interchangeable, but that owes as much to the two singers’ gritty, inherent similarities as it does to the keening reflection and roughhewn charm of Dunlap’s songwriting. </p>
<p>The heavy-hitters don’t slouch. Jeff Tweedy hasn’t been in an opening band for decades, but he downshifts into poignant underdog-ism on “The Ballad of the Opening Band”, the Platonic ideal of what song with such a title might sound like: twangy, bittersweet, and desperately hushed. Sure, it recalls the Replacements’ similarly-themed “Talent Show”—on which Dunlap played—a little too closely. But that only adds to its resonance, acting as either a sequel or a prequel to the better-known track. Lucinda Williams swaggers a little too shakily through “Partners in Crime”, but all those ragged edges add up by song’s end. “Little Shiva’s Song” is tackled by the Replacements’ close peers Soul Asylum, although its thin, tepid delivery is far outpaced by a younger native Minnesotan, the Hold Steady’s Craig Finn, who lends his shambolic bark to the raspy, scraping “Isn’t It”—and even manages to slip in a line from “Cruiser’s Creek” by the Fall, just for the fuck of it.</p>
<p>The Replacements themselves lead off with their sloppy, righteous, Bo-Diddley-stranded-at-the-roadhouse cover of Dunlap’s “Busted Up”, one of the tracks on the <i>Songs for Slim</i> EP. The original also hails from <i>The Old New Me</i>, which was Dunlap’s first record after the Replacements broke up in 1993 following their two Dunlap-era albums, 1989’s <i>Don’t Tell a Soul</i> and 1990’s <i>All Shook Down</i>. It’s clear why so much of the material from<i> Songs for Slim</i> is drawn from <i>The Old New Me</i>: Still wobbly from riding the rickety rollercoaster that Westerberg ran, Dunlap infused that album with a distinctly Westerbergian tilt—but drawing from his own Americana jones, a knack for sweet, folky observation and full-bore, blues-rock chug that predates Westerberg’s own foray into those areas by years. Tribute albums are beautiful things more often in sentiment than execution; that <i>Songs for Slim</i> not only rocks but educates means it pulls double duty. And like Dunlap’s tasteful, soulful licks themselves, it does so with ease and grace.</p></div>"|18751.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18751-songs-for-slim-rockin-here-tonight/|7.0|Jason Heller

The first is a pixelated smudge, a silhouette like a blocky comma, elegant in a way but subtly disturbing. The second, in high-resolution, reveals the image for what it is: a woman, back turned, skin bare and hair slick with fresh blood, defiant or defeated. It’s unsettling no matter which you look at first, and intentional or not, it’s eerily reminiscent of what made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16410-give-you-the-ghost/"" target=""_blank""><i>Give You the Ghost </i></a>one of 2012’s most unexpectedly complex debuts.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28643-gayngs/"" target=""_blank"">Gayngs</a> affiliate Ryan Olson produced that record with neither the kitsch nor alt-R&amp;B mimicry of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14188-relayted/"" target=""_blank""><i>Relayted</i></a>, but a sprawling, dense haze. Though <i>Ghost </i>had its own supergroup’s worth of personnel, including two excellent drummers (Twin Cities stalwarts Drew Christopherson and Ben Ivascu) given a soloist’s room to improvise, most of the instrumental parts were buried in the mix, at times sounding almost indistinct. This included vocalist Channy Leaneagh (Roma di Luna), a local star with torchy vocals smeared with reverb and Auto-Tune, sounding like she was singing brushstrokes not words. But when you listened close enough to hear what Leaneagh was actually saying, the songs became unsettlingly surreal, something bluntly masochistic—the closest <i>Ghost </i>came to letting light in was a track called “Leading to Death”, where Olson twists synth lines off-key at the last second and where lines like “I dream of you” end in “oh my strangler.” Close listening may reward itself by definition, but Poliça layered the haze on so thick it demanded it.</p>
<p>Where their new album <i>Shulamith</i> succeeds most is clearing that haze some while still maintaining the depth. The album doesn’t depart much from <i>Give You the Ghost, </i>but avoids the second-album stumbles of frequent comparisons the xx (sameyness) or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">the Weeknd</a> (self-indulgence). Mainly, <i>Shulamith</i> is more immediate; Poliça rein in the sprawl of their debut, bringing out higher highs, lower lows, clearer hooks. Even the midtempo cuts, like “Smug” and “Trippin”, simply <i>groove </i>more. At times you can trace the effect down to the track—the threatening Portishead skulk of “Very Cruel” evokes <i>Ghost</i>’s “Violent Games” with a heightened climax, while the rapidfire shudder of a drum solo that introduces and recurs throughout “Matty” is like its equivalent “I See My Mother”, except delivered with a viscerality that <i>Ghost </i>more often buried. Sometimes there’s no comparison at all, as in the bass-heavy, relatively upbeat synthpop of “Chain My Name”, the nocturnal throb and sparkle of “Spilling Lines”—which is as close to a straightforward dance track as Poliça’s ever come—or cavernous single “Tiff”, with an almost snide lyric, a subdued, vaguely menacing Justin Vernon feature, and unflinchingly violent accompanying video clip.</p>
<p>Another album in, Leaneagh’s vocals sound less like a gimmick and more just what Poliça do, but she too gets more moments of relative clarity, which reveals <i>Shulamith</i> as an equally bleak listen. The album is named for late feminist writer Shulamith Firestone, whom Leaneagh has called her “mentor and muse from the grave.” The last word may be key. Though Firestone is best known for the radical Marxist manifesto <i>The Dialectic of Sex, </i>she<b> </b>published one more book, her only other: the experimental memoir <i>Airless Spaces</i>, about her subsequent hospitalization and retreat from public life. The book, though comparatively obscure, was excerpted in a <i><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/04/15/130415fa_fact_faludi?currentPage=all"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The New Yorker</a> </i>remembrance last year:<i> </i>“She sometimes recognized on the faces of others joy and ambition and other emotions she could recall having had once, long ago. But her life was ruined, and she had no salvage plan.”</p>
<p>As such, Poliça’s invocation of Firestone is ambivalent, complicating itself even as it drops pullquote-courting lines. The most illustrative lyric isn’t the likes of “I don’t need a man” (an actual lyric, though thornier in context), but the very first line, from “Chain My Name: “So are we made just to fight all our lives?” Unlike <i>Ghost, </i>which for all its attention to detail had no real throughline, there’s a sense of careful sequencing here: the album begins with a fight and closes with the end of the fight. In Poliça’s telling, relationships are minefields, communication is elusive, and intimacy impossible. Emotions are either heightened, as in the breathless “Spilled Lines”, or, more often, numbed. Loss of identity is a recurring theme, usually in the form of losing one’s name, to marriage or otherwise; tellingly, the two tracks that address named people are either wry puns (“Tiff”, a name or an argument?) or sarcastic diminutives: “Matrimony” becomes “Matty”, a brooding track about a marriage broken from the start: “All this touching in the dark, I don’t think you ever heard me crying/ you’re not the first, you’re not the last.”</p>
<p>Perhaps most tellingly of all, the most explicitly feminist lines come in a resigned pair of tracks at the end of the album: “I Need $”, which starts with a twitchy rhythm section and lyrics spat in a defensive whir—“No one seems to stay, they just leave you cold…love what we need till the need grows tired”—and ends in exhausted synths and a resigned fade-out. The next track has its own slogan (“I don’t like when you tell the boys I’m your girl/ wear me round like a lucky charm with plastic pearls”), but the song surrounding it bleeds halfway through “So Leave”, a formless, disquieting closer that’s like Poliça’s sound unraveled, melodies becoming tatters and instrumental lines at polyrhythmic, distant odds. It’s among the most disturbing aspects of an album that already includes dystopian synths and videos of close-up waterboarding—yet it's the album’s one sprawling jam. <i>Shulamith, </i>in this way, demonstrates again Poliça’s greatest strength: making music that’s both an easy and a torturous listen. </p></div>"|18718.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18718-polica-shulamith/|7.5|Katherine St. Asaph

At present their audience is relatively small, setting up a marked contrast between where they find themselves and where they'd seemingly like to be heading. Their last LP, the <a href=""http://hipposintanks.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hippos in Tanks</a> release <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16829-exo/""><i>Exo</i></a>, wilted under the strain of ideas at times, ultimately forging an uncertain path between acid house-inspired club jams and a fondness for the bombast of rock. On the <i>Young Chronos</i> EP, a free Pirate Bay <a href=""http://thepiratebay.sx/torrent/9168415/Gatekeeper_-_Young_Chronos"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">torrent</a> that's also available for 300 USB tokens from the Italian label <a href=""http://www.prestorecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Presto!?</a>, they've kept the central tenets of their sound intact while solidifying their overall vision. This material is tighter and more expansive than what came before, with the sense of absurdity deliriously heightened.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If you've ever wondered what <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montserrat_Caball%C3%A9"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Montserrat Caballé</a> would sound like if she necked a fistful of pills and teamed up with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1809-a-guy-called-gerald/"">A Guy Called Gerald</a>, this is as close as you'll ever get. Operatic vocals are threaded in and out of the EP, along with enough dramatic élan for Hollywood to finally consider giving up on ""The Ride of The Valkyries"". Essentially this is the sound of Gatekeeper capitalizing on the closing track of <i>Exo</i>, ""Encarta"", where they blew everything wide open via imposing choirs, a healthy sense of pretense, and beats that sounded like they were storming the palace at Versailles. One of the tracks on <i>Young Chronos</i>, the fantastically titled ""Sword of the Gathering Clouds of Heaven"", begins with the kind of vigorous chanting that <i>Exo</i> closed out with, setting up a neat loop between one work and the other.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Another tie that binds this with prior Gatekeeper output is the feeling of high concept pranksters at work, albeit ones with a meagre budget compared to artists they’re obviously indebted to, such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26142-klf/"">the KLF</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15049-malcolm-mclaren/"">Malcolm McLaren</a>. McLaren even tried his hand at opera fusion on the 1984 record <i>Fans</i>, to uneven effect. The tracks here are anything but backward looking, instead taking elements of dance music's past (knotty twists of acid, thundering jungle-inspired drum programing) and spewing them out in an unholy mangle that's uniquely theirs. It works better as a representation of Gatekeeper's vision than <i>Exo</i>, partly because it's a quickie EP with half the tracks under the three-minute mark. But it's also because the pomposity is so well executed. There are grand plans here, hatched with a sense of ridiculous self importance, and humor.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The different shades of </span><i>Young Chronos </i><span>include patient builds (""Imperatix""), wonderfully ludicrous slow-burn tracks (""Flame of Displeasure""), and something that resembles incidental music from a lost arthouse feature (""The Soil Has Soured""). The highs and lows come rattling so fast that it's frequently disorienting, with ""Harvest"" and ""Hanseatic"" both dipping into disappointingly straight acid grooves just when they appeared to be leaning further into eccentricity. Fortunately, Arkell and Ross keep acting on extravagant ideas throughout, upping the sense of scale and ambition from </span><i>Exo</i><span> to a point where it's difficult to imagine how loud and wide they could go next time out. At the very least this is a strong step in the right direction. A search for the Pirate Bay torrent at the time of writing indicates </span><i>Young Chronos</i><span> has 11 seeds and one leecher. Such grandiose dreams need a far bigger stage than that. </span></p></div>"|18772.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18772-gatekeeper-young-chronos-ep/|6.4|Nick Neyland

But don’t dismiss them just yet. Nick Turco and Grace Hall take an overused sound palette and still make bewitching, genuinely sexy jams out of it. You might recognize Turco as the synth player for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"" target=""_blank"">Zola Jesus</a>, while Hall had turns in a number of punk-leaning bands before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12498-808s-and-heartbreak/"" target=""_blank""><i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i></a> stole her heart away. It’s almost too perfect of a scenario, but it helps that they’re both obviously talented; Turco’s synthscapes are huge and scene-stealing, while Hall’s husky voice strikes a glorious medium between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">Abel Tesfaye</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24891-sade/"" target=""_blank"">Sade</a>. Together, they’ve crafted a strong debut album that flirts with the hipster-R&amp;B zeitgeist without giving itself away altogether.</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The Weeknd’s influence haunts <i>The Room</i>. It’s unavoidable, seeping into the phrasing of the first two tracks, “2Nite” and “The Zone"". Fey and rigid at the same time, Hall squeezes syllables into a half-rap, half-sung cadence, letting them fly out in melisma at choice moments; when she commands “get my body on the floor” on the latter, she sounds like she’s doing her best Tesfaye impression. But Skin Town are friendlier than the Weeknd—less lecherous and more melodic—and the band can’t be boiled down to one single comparison. The rest of the time Hall sounds like no one but herself, and she’s a stunningly skilled singer who can try on the phrasing of the best of ‘em whenever she needs a quick thrill. That’s not even mentioning Turco, who blesses “2Nite” with synths that strike the backdrop like 3D glacier shards, appropriating the unnaturally bright sounds of vapourwave.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">For all the hallmarks they borrow from the public consciousness, there are plenty of moments on <i>The Room </i>that are all theirs. Hall’s cascading vocals on “Rain” are unforgettable over Turco’s surging synths, like a trance track stuck in neutral. “Hit Down,” meanwhile, zooms in on an aspect of 90s R&amp;B that’s too often forgotten, with a loose trip-hop style beat that’s somewhere between SWV and Spice Girls. “Ice Crystal Palace” is a gilded ballad full of lovesick instrumentation and larger-than-life adult contemporary synths, while the album winds down with its dramatic title track, where big booming drums compete with vamping funk leads.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The duo are still learning their way around songwriting, however. “Ride” is essentially a series of irresistible hooks each launching off the momentum of the last, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"" target=""_blank"">The-Dream</a> style, over one of the album’s most minimal beats. But then there’s the chorus—“Ride him like a bike/ Ride him like a bike” and elsewhere “Got me greased up babe/ Feel it deep inside”—which is startlingly blunt but way too graphic to be sexy. (This is coming from a band called Skin Town, after all.) Hall’s boldness is a large part of the album’s appeal, but it’s sometimes misplaced, like the halfhearted rapping in ""Throwin' Shade"", an attempt to sound menacing that comes off completely inert.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Minor flaws aside, the ground that Skin Town manage to cover on their debut is remarkable. Their album comes on Time No Place, the L.A. label home to acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29623-nguzunguzu/"" target=""_blank"">Nguzunguzu</a>, Rainbow Arabia and Coyote Clean Up, all artists who take various reference points and make pop culture soup out of them, usually in a way very slanted towards the electronic music world. Which puts Skin Town in an strange position—they're clearly an R&amp;B group, but they could easily be marketed as electronic auteurs with a good singer. However you take them, it's hard to deny that they make a great pair, and though they're still a little wet behind the ears, <i>The Room</i> shows that the past two years' explosion in gothic-tinted R&amp;B has some healthy fruits to bear after all.</span></p></div>"|18726.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18726-skin-town-the-room/|7.4|Andrew Ryce

The analogy became a lazy one, but its basis is understandable. Molina’s debut single under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26175-songs-ohia/"" target=""_blank"">Songs: Ohia</a> moniker, 1996’s “Nor Cease Thou Never Now”, was released on Oldham’s own Palace Records, and his quivering, sing-speak cadence bears an unmistakable resemblance to Oldham’s. That association endured—up to and including a 2002 collaboration between Molina and Oldham (plus Appendix Out’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3583-alasdair-roberts/"" target=""_blank"">Alasdair Roberts</a>) called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/148-amalgamated-sons-of-rest-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Amalgamated Sons of Rest</i></a>. But there are two other singing-songwriting contemporaries of Molina that make for equally apt comparisons: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18-ryan-adams/"" target=""_blank"">Ryan Adams</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"" target=""_blank"">Elliott Smith</a>. Adams’s <i>Gold</i> came out in 2001, and its unabashed ode to heartland-fueled classic rock emboldened a generation of punk-and-indie shitkickers to embrace their FM-radio roots. Smith had turned increasingly away from indie rock and toward a more organic classic-pop sound in the late 90s and early 00s—that is, until his suicide in 2003 cut that evolution short.</p>
<p>That year also marked the release of Molina’s best and most pivotal album: <i>The Magnolia Electric Co.</i>, which showcased his own strong shift toward rock populism. Imbued with a dust-under-the-fingernails weariness, the album is so representative of Molina’s sound and spirit, he subsequently took Magnolia Electric Co. as his new band’s name. Molina’s work on <i>Magnolia </i>wasn’t as cryptically oblique as Oldham, as stadium-sized as Adams, or as harmonically polished as Smith. It was, perhaps for the first time in his recording tenure, pure and full Molina. But the album installed itself into the American songwriter landscape circa '03 in a way that closed the circuit among his peers and secretly, quietly willed a pocket of the zeitgeist into being.</p>
<p>The 10th anniversary of <i>The Magnolia Electric Co.</i> is upon us, hence the obligatory 10th-anniversary reissue. The album would have called for the deluxe retrospective treatment even if Molina hadn’t died earlier this year, of organ failure related to his long struggle with alcohol. The respectful euphemisms have flown. The bottom line, however, is harsh: Molina drank himself to death.<i> </i>But<i> Magnolia </i>is not a drunk record, nor is it a drinking record. While legions of alt-country troubadours have drained the tear-in-my-beer song of much of its traditionalist proof, <i>Magnolia</i> is sharp, clear-eyed, and savagely focused.</p>
<p>Beginning the album with “Farewell Transmission” is more than an act of perversity. Molina lays out his blueprint not just for the rest of <i>Magnolia Electric Co. </i>the album<i>,</i> but for the rest of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2945-magnolia-electric-co/"" target=""_blank"">Magnolia Electric Co.</a> the band. What once was jittery and hesitant in his delivery is now howlingly powerful; gone is Songs: Ohia’s push-and-pull between intimacy and stridency. In its place is red-blood, full-throated, post-hippie country rock, right down to a name that evokes both Quicksilver Messenger Service and the Grateful Dead’s “Sugar Magnolia”. Only this is Cosmic American Music scorched by the heat of reentry, space-cowboy romance for the year of the Columbia shuttle disaster. “Must be a big star about to fall,” Molina rasps in awestruck wonder over amber waves of twang and pedal-steel majesty. The sweetheart of the rodeo now works at a truck stop somewhere on Route 66, handing out the men’s room key and smiling crookedly to hide her missing teeth.</p>
<p>Route 66 is mentioned by name on “John Henry Split My Heart”, and it’s more than just an obvious stab at harnessing American mythology. But it is that—an homage to the folk archetypes of a relatively young nation, yet one that hauls around so much weight. Calling Molina a death-obsessed singer-songwriter would be as off the mark as calling him a drunk singer-songwriter. Still, the gravity of “John Henry”—especially its bruising distortion and spiraling chords—hits like a Dust Bowl twister. And on “I’ve Been Riding with the Ghost”, a more hushed meditation on absence and regret builds into a stiff, inexorable shuffle toward death, complete with ghoulish backups by Molina’s frequent foil, Jennie Benford of Jim &amp; Jennie and the Pinetops (the group with whom Molina recorded the sparse <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7338-didnt-it-rain/"" target=""_blank""><i>Didn’t It Rain</i></a> in 2002). “Ghost” is almost Halloweenish in its spooky, oohing, voice-and-guitar refrain, but that dead-leaf brittleness raises gooseflesh. And when, on the churning threnody “Almost Was Good Enough”, Molina chants, “Almost no one makes it out,” it’s Crazy Horse galloping along the lip of a cliff. </p>
<p>For every act of negation—self- or otherwise—on <i>Magnolia</i>, there’s an imperative. “Just Be Simple” is Molina’s lone commandment, only he wields his Occam’s razor with a gentle subtlety, even as his arrangements are far more textured and complex than they let on. “Everything you hated me for/ Honey, there was so much more,” he sings softly and cleanly; meanwhile, what he doesn’t sing screams volumes. The obvious reference is to Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Simple Man”, only here there’s no external narrator, no motherly figure through which to filter homespun wisdom. This is a hard-earned, heart-damaged cautionary tale told far too late for caution to do any good, and Molina seems content to judge no one but himself. “Hold on Magnolia” also delivers an order, but again it’s directed inward. “You might be holding the last light I see/ Before the dark finally gets a hold of me,” he pleads over lonesome strums before adding doubtfully, “Hold on, Magnolia/ I know what a true friend you’ve been.” The eerie similarity between “Magnolia” and “Molina” isn’t lost on anyone.</p>
<p>The dark-horse tracks of <i>Magnolia</i> have only gotten better with age. Presented back-to-back in the middle of the album, “The Old Black Hen” and “Peoria Lunch Box Blues” feature guests vocalists—grizzled country singer Lawrence Peters on the former and British-born singer Scout Niblett on the latter. Both are excellent. On “Black Hen”, Peters drawls like molasses across a honky-tonk funeral waltz; “Peoria”, on the other hand, conjures a mystic, distorted-folk lope worthy of Sandy Denny-era Fairport Convention. More than just being strong on their own, though, this one-two punch gives Molina a breather from all the turned-earth bleakness—plus it describes the entirety of the spectrum he draws from: orthodox Americana on one hand and otherworldly atmosphere on the other.</p>
<p>When it comes to the bonus tracks, not a moment is wasted. The complete set of guitar-plus-vocals demos—originally included in a limited-edition run of <i>Magnolia</i> upon its first release—shows the bones of “Black Hen” and “Peoria” with Molina himself supplying the vocals, studies in haunted restraint that recall the Songs: Ohia of old. “Just Be Simple” is given the most felicitous treatment as a skeleton of its full-band self. Every crevice and shiver of Molina’s voice is allowed to hang in empty space, naked and aching. The pair of newly restored outtakes, “The Big Game Is Every Night” and “Whip Poor Will”, are essential to the album; hearing them in the context of the established track listing, it’s hard to imagine how <i>Magnolia </i>ever did without them. “Whip Poor Will” is light and sweet, a melancholic confection in which Molina plucks at taut strings and duets with Benford, whom Molina begs to “Sing it, sister, one more time.” Their harmonies on the chorus are jagged, uneven, vinegary, perfect.</p>
<p>But it’s “The Big Game Is Every Night” that truly astounds: 10 glorious minutes long, the song pulses like a severed vein, its rhythm slowly ebbing out as Molina sings, “The last thing I see/ Let it be me helping/ Honestly, let it be me working/ On being a better me.” Only Molina knew if he fulfilled that promise to himself before he died. Ultimately, that’s all that matters about <i>Magnolia</i>, regardless of its maker’s deserved place in the pantheon alongside Oldham, Adams, and Smith: the way Molina sank his roots so deep, they took up more than they could bear.</p></div>"|18704.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18704-songs-ohia-the-magnolia-electric-co/|9.0|Jason Heller

In that two year span, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4660-wolf-parade/"" target=""_blank"">Wolf Parade</a>—one of the most celebrated indie rock bands of the 2000s—announced their indefinite hiatus. Around that same time, Krug dissolved his much-loved <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4126-sunset-rubdown/"" target=""_blank"">Sunset Rubdown</a>, forged a new solo project called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28467-moonface/"" target=""_blank"">Moonface</a>, saw the end of a particularly intense romance, and left Canada for Finland. There, Krug linked up to Finnish rockers Siinai for the seething breakup record <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16495-moonface-with-siinai-heartbreaking-bravery/"" target=""_blank""><i>Heartbreaking Bravery</i></a>. Krug's pre-<i>Bravery</i> Moonface efforts—2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13899-dreamland-ep-marimba-and-shit-drums/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dreamland EP: Marimba and Shit-Drums</i></a> and 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15674-organ-music-not-vibraphone-like-id-hoped/"" target=""_blank""><i>Organ Music Not Vibraphone Like I'd Hoped</i></a>—found him training his focus on a particular instrument, a fascinating process that nevertheless yielded mixed results. Krug's maintained a commitment to making every Moonface record very different than the last, and with Siinai's help, <i>Bravery</i> was the closest thing to a full-on rock record he'd been part of since Wolf Parade's 2010 swan song, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14398-expo-86/"" target=""_blank""><i>Expo 86</i></a>. <i>Julia With Blue Jeans On</i>, his latest, is another sharp left turn: with nothing but piano and Krug's voice, it's the starkest, most gripping Moonface record to date, and one of the finest LPs of Krug's prolific, unpredictable career.</p>
<p>In his work with Wolf Parade and Sunset Rubdown, Krug, a classically trained pianist from a young age, shied away from the acoustic piano used throughout <i>Julia</i>. In interviews, he's claimed the choice to return to the piano was an attempt to refold some simplicity into his oft-knotty work and to bring more clarity and optimism in the wake of the ruminative <i>Bravery</i>. The stripped-back sound of <i>Julia</i> is never less than striking; Krug, whose agitated compositions and operatically addled vocals have often been marked by wild leaps and jittery flourishes, has never made a record this well-shorn. True, <i>Julia</i>'s got its share of dramatically cascading melodies and plenty of big chest-bursting flare ups; although Krug's claimed Julia's inspiration came from sources as disparate as modernist icon Erik Satie and Rachel Grimes' solo effort <i>Book of Leaves</i>, even the most serene songs here couldn't have come from anyone else. Still, it's not just <i>Julia</i>'s denuded piano-and-voice constructions that keep it feeling considerably less frantic than much of Krug's work; both lyrically and compositionally, he's not jamming as much information into every stanza, which makes every note—and every word—count.</p>
<p>""I am a barbarian sometimes,"" Krug sings a minute or so into the album's opening track, and time and again throughout <i>Julia</i>, Krug returns to this kind of brutal self-examination. Although the bile that underlined much of <i>Bravery</i> is gone, there's plenty of regret and self-loathing to go around. It's as though Krug, looking back on the relationship he spent <i>Bravery</i> deconstructing, has newfound perspective on just what went wrong, and rather than casting aspersions elsewhere, he's looked inward and found himself every bit as at fault for its downfall. ""I have a way of bleeding dry anything you'd call a rose,"" he sings on the album's title track; on ""Love the House You're In"", he likens himself to a ""well-intentioned demon"" and ""a ghost lighting up in the courtyard."" <i>Julia</i>'s lyrics find Krug—long fond of vaguely fanciful, sometimes impenetrable imagery—retreating from metaphor, retelling the story of love's end with often shocking clarity. A thread of Biblical imagery runs throughout <i>Julia</i>, but by Krug's standards, these allegories aren't difficult to parse. ""Everyone has to gather souls around them to feel useful, and loving, and loved,"" he sings on ""Everyone is Noah, Everyone is the Ark"", still trying to navigate the storm without a partner at his side.</p>
<p>Most of <i>Julia</i> is at least semi-autobiographical, albeit somewhat out of order; ""November 2011"" comes fairly close to a blow-by-blow recount, but spend enough time with the disc, and the narrative starts to fully unfold. Centerpiece ""Dreamy Summer"", the out-and-out loveliest of <i>Julia</i>'s 10 tracks, seems to describe a time before the troubles. On ""Barbarian"", Krug confesses ""darling, it's finally the fall, and finally, I've not destroyed anything at all."" But by the time closer ""Your Chariot Awaits"" rolls around, Krug admits ""we got way too close way too quickly."" Where <i>Heartbreaking Bravery</i>'s Siinai-assisted bloodletting pushed Krug's feelings outward, <i>Julia</i>'s quieter, more reflective sonics illustrate the time he's spent looking inward. ""Set fire to my music, it wasn't much good anyway,"" he sings on ""November."" That's far from true, but <i>Julia</i> is clearly Krug's attempt at burning it all down and starting anew.</p>
<p>Compositionally, <i>Julia</i>'s marked by a marvelously uncharacteristic simplicity. For every intricate right-hand construction, there's a series of blunt, forceful chords, better suited to enhancing emotion than inspiring awe. Krug's music has, in the past, sometimes felt overly showy, often using three notes when two would do fine, shifting rhythms and enjambing lyrics to onerous effect. On the whole, Krug's Moonface records—like the early Sunset Rubdown EPs, which also centered around a single instrument—are less dizzying than some of Sunset Rubdown's more circuitous work, but they've occasionally seemed more conceptually clever than genuinely captivating. There's an urgency at work throughout <i>Julia</i> that keeps convolution at bay, a sense that these songs had to come out this way, commanding and unadorned. On paper, the piano-centric <i>Julia</i> may appear to be another of Krug's experiments, stripping back as a means to stave off boredom. But Krug, in foregrounding his voice and minimizing the instrumentation, is clearly trying to limit the distance between himself and these songs, resulting in his most immediately gripping work in ages.</p>
<p>Chances are, you won't put on <i>Julia</i> very often; it's emotionally exhausting, 48 minutes of soul laid bare. Between the spartan presentation and the deep wells of longing, it's not an easy listen, not made for the background, which means you're going to have to find yourself in a mood a lot like Krug's to want to sit there and get swept up in it for the better part of an hour. Though <i>Julia</i> ends with a bit more optimism than it begins with, whatever streaks of hopefulness Krug promised after the frothing <i>Bravery</i> aren't easy to find here.

Perfect prep narrative (I mean, c’mon, even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">Vampire Weekend</a> don’t sail), pretty pop songs, that sort of thing. But perfect and pretty get boring after a minute, and the two have come to realize that. With their third release, the five-song <i>Small Sound </i>EP, Tennis complicate the easy breezy beautiful schtick with some positive results. </p>
<p>The effort works off last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16252-young-and-old/"" target=""_blank""><i>Young and Old</i></a>, which the Denver-based band recorded with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys/"" target=""_blank"">Black Key</a> Patrick Carney acting as producer. Carney helped Tennis park the boat in the garage, upping the fuzz considerably from debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15020-cape-dory/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cape Dory</i></a>. Here on <i>Small Sound</i>, producer Richard Swift helps Tennis grow. “Dimming Light” starts with a sour riff that evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30159-mac-demarco/"" target=""_blank"">Mac DeMarco</a>, but ends strong with straightforward piano layered atop a tense synth line; hearing its arrangement, it's easy to imagine Swift coming in and taking over. Even with his own music, Swift tends to wear his vintage influences on his sleeve. If this guy can make the <i>new</i> Shins groove, he shouldn’t have too much trouble infusing 1970s flavor to Tennis’ Brill Building aesthetic from a decade earlier.</p>
<p>But Tennis aren’t Fitz and the Tantrums or anything quite so gaudy. Moore, Riley, and drummer James Barone work within their limitations to create an EP that offers subtle twists to their throwback thing. What sounds to be bassoon immediately funks up “Cured of Youth”, while Moore actually gets an opportunity to belt on the standout track. Organ lines, too, are peppered throughout the EP, but never overpower. “100 Lovers” sees Moore recalling an ex who was a real heartbreaker, her astutely noting, “100 loves will make you bold, 100 more will make you cold.” It’s the stuff of 60s Girl Group gold, but it goes to show you that while the music can progress, the lyrics won’t necessarily follow.</p>
<p>At their worst, narrative-heavy buzz bands like Tennis are the indie rock equivalent of YouTube novelty songs. Lyrics about coconut groves are precious, sure, but it’s hard to feel like there’s a future in that. It’s not to say blissed-out guitar pop isn’t a viable path—look at where Beach House have masterfully taken their sound—but Moore will never have Victoria Legrand's vocal depth. She’ll always sound sweet and innocent, better cooing atop a retro riff than leading listeners into dark corners. Moore sounds positively determined on the EP’s single and strongest song, “Mean Streets”, but when she chants the line, “Born and raised on the mean streets/ That’s where she learned how to keep the beat,” it’s hard to imagine she’s speaking autobiographically. Only so much change can be achieved over two LPs and one EP.</p>
<p>To liken Tennis to the liquid state of being would be insulting, but they do seem to take on the shape of the container they’re in. Essentially, each producer adds something new to the sound. Maybe by the next LP, they’ll have built something with real dimension. </p></div>"|18713.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18713-tennis-small-sound-ep/|7.0|Jillian Mapes

Jasamine White-Gluz and Laura Lloyd pushed their vocals to the front of their compositions, turning amorphous layers of sound into reasonably intelligible, catchy hooks; on standouts like ""Hare Tarot Lies"" and ""Wrack Attack"", their silvery, melodic guitar lines scrubbed away sludge, leaving behind straightforward dream-pop songs. The band's new EP, </span><i>Pastel and Pass Out</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, is meant to coincide with an upcoming trek through Europe, and over the course of its three songs No Joy extends the new accessibility of </span><i>Wait to Pleasure</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> into a surprising spryness with structure, brevity, and dynamism.<br/><br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">The EP's playfulness begins with its title. </span><i>Pastel and Pass Out</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> is the perfect tagline for No Joy c. 2013: they're a band equally comfortable with soft-hued palettes and brutal knockout blows, like Mike Tyson waking up early on a dewy April morning to paint with watercolors. Lead single ""Last Boss"" conveys this message with impressive efficiency, as it moves from a simple marriage of melody and motorik chug into slugging, squealing riffs into a final, meditative section in just over three minutes. The band makes thoughtful use of volume and space to chop the song into these three discrete parts, and in doing so they amplify the size of the difference between said parts; we hear guitars massing like dark clouds on the horizon towards the end of the song's first minute, and in the next second we're thrown into the eye of the storm.<br/><br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">The other two songs on </span><i>Pastel and Pass Out</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> take the two faces of ""Last Boss"" and blow them up into distinct tracks in their own right. ""Starchild is Dead"" subjugates a rather pretty guitar lead with incredibly dense, crunchy waves of noise, the kind that compel listeners to zip over to cleaner songs just to make sure their headphones aren't broken. The arrangement's weight, and the appeal of the plumes of the melody that finally rise from the arrangement, are reminiscent of the chewiest work done by No Joy's shoegaze ancestors; when a single note escapes and starts roaring and squealing above the din, there's almost something classical about it.<br/><br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Meanwhile, EP closer ""Second Spine"" benefits from thoughtful sequencing and the band's understanding of rhythm and momentum. Coming on the heels of two ferocious performances, the band establishes tension with little more than slight upticks in rhythmic intensity, channeled through drum and bass volume. When the chorus comes and goes without a crushing wall of guitar sound, it becomes clear the listener has been subject to an artful feint, one that elevates a simply pretty song into an interesting one. <br/><br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Perhaps the most impressive aspect of </span><i>Pastel and Pass Out</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> is its economy: it takes No Joy less than twelve minutes to refine and expand on the musical ideas they first presented on </span><i>Wait to Pleasure </i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">earlier this year. With two sets of full-length albums and accompanying EP extensions, the band has established a dependable pattern of step-wise growth; </span><i>Pastel and Pass Out </i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">is a small but strong release that should tide fans over until No Joy's next major statement.</span></p></div>"|18707.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18707-no-joy-pastel-and-pass-out-ep/|7.6|Jamieson Cox

Listen the right way, and the music turns into this fantastic puzzle, or maybe an equation that works out just so: Hook the beat up, convert it into hip-hop form, write a rhyme, etc. There's a specific kind of hip-hop that tends to fit this mindset best, in which the lyrics are geared in equal parts toward head and record scratching, the beats put you in a zone, and the only possible reaction is turn to your (perhaps equally stoned) friend and say ""that's dope.""</p>
<p>That style is one that the Los Angeles-based label Stones Throw excels in, and MC/producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30131-jonwayne/"" target=""_blank"">Jonwayne</a> is more or less the label's archetypal practitioner. Coming from an electronic background inspired by hanging out as a teenager in L.A.'s beat underground during the rise of artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"" target=""_blank"">Flying Lotus</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28105-the-gaslamp-killer/"" target=""_blank"">the Gaslamp Killer</a>, Jonwayne has spent the last couple years staking out a claim as an MC with his series of <i>Cassette </i>mixtapes. His vibe is that of the friendly slacker dude who seems to always be hanging around in high school parking lots or dorm common rooms, eager to talk your ear off about some obscure psychedelia band or Wu-Tang deep cuts. With his proper debut, <i>Rap Album One</i>, he's upfront about what he's offering, cutting a Silent Bob or Dude-like figure in press photos and using a picture of a saltine cracker (wink, wink) as his album cover.</p>
<p>Pretty much everything about Jonwayne's approach to rap can be summed up in his lines from ""You Can Love Me When I'm Dead"", in which he explains, ""this is rap shit, recite banter with high standards/ cold-blooded art like a salamander on fine canvas."" His lyrics are clever and exactingly written, full of dense internal rhymes, and carefully thought-out punchlines. Although he offers some biography, particularly on ""The Come Up Pt. 1 and Pt. 2"", mostly he sticks to lyrical-bread-and-butter stuff that can't really be begrudged.</p>
<p>But while Wayne may be a rapper who seems primarily interested in technique, he's not a very technically interesting rapper. Almost all of his verses are delivered in a monotone, and he rarely varies his flow to sound any way other than steady and studiously composed. He raps slowly and deliberately, often taking a pause between bars, in a way that makes lines land like stoner proclamations or <a href=""http://www.deepthoughtsbyjackhandey.com/random2.asp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Deep Thoughts</a>. Lyrics like ""Shoes in the closet/ My stomach's got too many knots to justify tying laces and looking sharp"" seem profound but end up revealing themselves as aimless upon closer inspection. On the song ""Yung Grammar"", the sort-of funny idea of screwing down a hook about grammar skills is immediately undermined by the revelation that there's basically nothing that sounds more boring screwed than a list of the parts of speech.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, though, it's these types of experiments that yield the album's best results. Much of ""You Can Love Me When I'm Dead"" is simply a piano riff that leans heavily on the instrument's rarely used low end and a drum machine with the phrase ""every time I grab the mic I rock it just like that"" being scratched in different ways. It sounds cool, and it's easy to zone out to, a trip to the traditionalist rap fan's subconscious. On ""Zeroh's Song"", by far the album's best and most interesting cut, rapping is more or less abandoned as snatches of sung phrases flit in and out of the track. Wayne blurts out the screwed-down phrase ""they went back to moon!"", and counts in a sinister voice over meandering synthesizer plinks. It's totally weird and fun, connecting the dots between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a>, DJ Screw and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"" target=""_blank"">Chance the Rapper</a>, the moment when the album feels the least deliberate and the most playful.</p>
<p>The upside to Wayne's exacting approach throughout is that the production sounds fantastic, a clear indication of where his roots lie as an artist. His sound is minimal, in many cases relying on just piano and subdued drum pattern—live he uses just a sampler and a mic—which works to vivid effect. ""Sandals"", for instance, relies almost entirely on hi-hats, a perfectly calm match for Wayne's low-key style. While the rapping on <i>Rap Album One</i> can feel bogged down in thought, the production benefits from the almost mathematical approach (things get literally mathematical on the vinyl version, which, at 45 RPM, is designed to sound screwed down when played at a normal 33 ⅓ RPM). The album may be hard to connect to on anything other than a cerebral level, but sometimes that's the best way to connect.</p></div>"|18715.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18715-jonwayne-rap-album-one/|6.0|Kyle Kramer

These days it’s easy to feel skeptical about words like “deluxe,” “expanded,” “rebooted,” or any other focus-grouped synonym—particularly when they’re attached to the name of a record you could have sworn came out a few months ago. Blame the ever-accelerating nostalgia cycle, the desperate marketing tactics of a wheezing industry, or the everyone-on-the-team-gets-a-trophy mentality of our youth; probably just blame all three. But whatever the reason, we’ve gotten to a place where albums have Frankensteinian titles like<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Friday:_Roman_Reloaded_%E2%80%93_The_Re-Up"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i> Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded - The Re-Up</i></a>, and the extra, wait-wait-there’s-more material on these revamps often feels obligatory, forced, and better off back in the vault.</p>
<p>Leave it to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Grizzly Bear</a>, though, to be an exception to the rule. The Brooklyn-based craftsmen of sepia-toned chamber pop have a history of putting out non-album releases that are much better and more meticulously arranged than they need to be. Take, for example, their 2007 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10871-friend-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Friend </i>EP</a>: Judging from the tracklist, it might have seemed like an “expanded” version of the previous year’s breakthrough <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9365-yellow-house/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yellow House</i></a>. <i>Friend </i>featured alternate takes of old songs, a few covers <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">(some by the band themselves and some by contemporaries like </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/632-band-of-horses/"" target=""_blank"">Band of Horses</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4821-css/"" target=""_blank"">CSS</a>)<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, and a self-recorded demo. But when you listened, it was clear that this was much more than some half-assed stop-gap between proper albums. </span><i>Friend</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> now feels like an essential release in Grizzly Bear’s catalogue, home to a live staple (their creepy, cavernous reconstruction of the Crystals’ “He Hit Me”) and a pivotal moment in guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8906-daniel-rossen/"" target=""_blank"">Daniel Rossen</a>’s evolving and increasingly distinct style. The EP’s electric version of “Little Brother”—a six-minute, six-string supernova of a song—remains one of his finest recorded moments with this band.</span></p>
<p><i>Shields: Expanded</i> feels like something of a throwback to <i>Friend</i>, thanks in part to the refreshingly pragmatic way that Warp is releasing it. There is an “expanded edition” that contains the original album along with the bonus material, but people who already have <i>Shields</i> can just buy the 12” <i>Shields: B-Sides</i> (and people who don’t care about vinyl can simply buy the extras digitally).<i> Shields</i> was recorded after Grizzly Bear took their first short hiatus; after the time apart (Rossen and bassist Chris Taylor put out solo records; founding vocalist Ed Droste did some traveling), they reconvened in Marfa, Tex., for what would be an unexpectedly discouraging recording session. They worked on about 20 demos there, but none made the record. <i>Shields: Expanded</i> collects the best of these previously unheard Marfa tracks, which amount to captivating sketches, rather than scraps.</p>
<p>The swooping “Taken Down” is driven by Rossen’s babbling-brook finger-picking and an anguished vocal from Droste; “Everyone I Know” is an even sparser evocation of the same mood. <i>Shields </i>wasn’t exactly an upbeat record, but what’s surprising is how dark—at times even violent—these Marfa tracks are. Is this the sound of a band thrashing out their frustrations with an inert recording session, or their anxiety about trying top their past work? “Will Calls”, the best of the demos, definitely seems to be raging at <i>something</i>. Like a rougher-hewn version of <i>Yellow House</i>’s gorgeous finale “Colorado”, it wrestles between soft, somnolent moments and the closest thing Grizzly Bear can come to a genuine freak-out. The chorus—Droste’s unvarnished yelps and Rossen’s joltingly loud guitar—feels like a satisfying exorcism of bottled-up rage.</p>
<p>The last three songs here are remixes and they’re decidedly hit-or-miss. I’m not sure the world needed to hear what a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2619-lindstrom/"" target=""_blank"">Lindstrøm</a> remix of the effervescently proggy “Gun-Shy” would sound like, and the results are about what you’d expect: The neon-plastic track sounds like an unused instrumental the Norwegian disco producer had lying around, with Droste’s vocal track placed overtop about halfway through. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars/"" target=""_blank"">Liars</a>’ take on “A Simple Answer” fares a little better: Fragmented loops of “ahhs” and “oohs” build a misty, fogged-window atmosphere that dissipates once—pretty unwarrentedly—a driving beat interrupts two-thirds of the way through. Luckily, though, there is one straight-up gem in the bunch. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29422-nicolas-jaar/"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Jaar</a> doesn’t remix “Sleeping Ute” so much as toss it into to a zero-gravity chamber and watch each element drift around gracefully, asking you to examine it anew. Grizzly Bear’s music is as much about the notes as the spaces between them—and the dust mites floating ethereally in those spaces between. Jaar gets this; and given how carefully his own music conjures space, he’s an intuitive choice for this track. It’s enough to make you wish that he and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30070-darkside/"">Darkside</a> collaborator Dave Harrington would give <i>Shields</i> the same full-album treatment they recently gave <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories/"" target=""_blank""><i>Random Access Memories</i></a>.</p>
<p><i>Shields: Expanded</i> doesn’t stand on its own quite the way that the bar-setting <i>Friend</i> EP did. But as far as “deluxe editions” go, it’s so refreshing you (almost) want to call it special: Consistent from start to finish (especially if you end on the Jaar remix), exactly as long as it needs to be, and revealing without being unflattering. For fans, it will come as something of a relief. If the infamous Marfa material that the band thought disappointing was actually this good, then <i>Shields: Expanded</i> is a comforting assurance of how hard it would be for a Grizzly Bear record to actually suck.</p></div>"|18693.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18693-grizzly-bear-shields-b-sides/|7.4|Lindsay Zoladz

Though his catalog may paint him as a Thoreau figure who draws mana from the trees and moss, Elverum is a man wild with contradictions, just like anyone.</p>
<p>On last year's remarkable song “Through the Trees Pt. 2”, Elverum sang a simple non sequitur: “Mountains and websites.” These words could serve as a subtitle to the collection of songs on <span><i>Pre-Human Ideas</i>.</span><span> To be clear, these aren’t new songs. (Well, they're sort of new.) These are instructional demos Elverum made entirely on GarageBand, also seen on the cover art, specifically for the musicians on Mount Eerie’s 2012 tour. All of the vocal parts are sung by Elverum and filtered through an Auto-Tune setting, including the female vocals once sang by Allyson Foster on several cuts off </span><span><i>Clear Moon</i>, </span><span>now put through a “female voice” pitch-shift preset</span><span>.</span><span> The bulk of the album comprises songs from </span><span><i>Clear Moon</i>, </span><span>but includes three other songs from his back catalogue, and two analog organ drone pieces that bookend the album, which were “previously buried in other songs.”</span></p>
<p>Recontextualizing songs is familiar territory for Elverum, whose immense catalog essentially functions as a big flow-chart, with overlapping narratives of nature and mysticism, remixes and rereleases, part ones and part twos. <i>Pre-Human</i><span><i> Ideas</i> inserts a previously unheard digital element into Elverum’s ecosystem, with hopes that it will cohabitate with the analog. It’s good, too, that these songs are variations on the familiar, and not entirely new compositions, which would just be too jarring. Remember, this is the first time Elverum has ever multi-tracked anything on a computer, written drum parts and guitar parts that are just MIDI loops, and the first time he recorded vocals on his laptop using the tiny microphone on iPhone earbuds while at a layover at the Frankfort airport in Germany. Talking about this album is not unlike talking about Mount Eerie guitar tabs.</span></p>
<p>Elverum has also rewritten lyrics and added new sections songs, most notably on “House Shape” and the <i>Eleven </i><i>Old Songs</i> track “I Say ‘No’”. Though here, especially, it’s less about the content of songs and more the texture of them. These remakes can sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins"">Cocteau Twins</a> coded an album in MS-DOS, or perhaps more toward what Justin Vernon has been playing with in his adventures out of the cabin and into the Auto-Tune. The perversion of the natural has already been made by Kanye co-opting Bon Iver’s “Woods” into his own global pop oeuvre. But Elverum never wants to work on grand levels. These are insular songs that speak mainly to each other, all breathing the same air of Elverum's home in Anacortes, WA.  </p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The efficacy of these digital reinterpretations differ. There are some bits of goofiness on here, particularly the chintzy horn sounds on the otherwise remarkable version of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15991-lone-bell-pre-human-ideas-version/""><span>“Lone Bell”</span></a><span>, and even though there’s a whole new form and bridge to “House Shape” it still feels too precise and inhuman. It’s best to approach these songs with a cautious soft focus, because close listening too often reveals that, yes, these are at heart didactic GarageBand demos and that cymbal sounds stupid. But if anything, it’s more enlightening than your average remix album, or a set of actual demos or alternate takes that would normally be fodder on Disc 2 of a reissue. I may not prefer the pared down, pixelized version of “No Inside, No Out” to the skittering analog version, but I do prefer that ringing in Elverum’s ear to be “deep and wide” followed by a crash of digital doom guitars as opposed to its original lyrics “faint and high” followed by a tinnitus/dissonance drone on the end of “I Say ‘No’”. Your mileage may vary.</span></p>

To hear Temple tell it, <i>Good Mood Fool</i>, his first solo LP since Here We Go Magic's launch—his 2011 effort <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15726-dont-act-like-you-dont-care/"" target=""_blank"">Don't Act Like You Don't C</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15726-dont-act-like-you-dont-care/"" target=""_blank"">are</a></i> was recorded before the release of HWGM's debut—never would've made it as a Magic LP; had Temple tried to inject <i>Fool</i>'s synth-heavy dalliances with reggae, 80's R&amp;B and lite-funk into Here We Go Magic's twinkly kraut-folk, he would've found himself swiftly outvoted. (They might've talked him out of the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bbULF7KcGQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arby's slogan</a>-skirting title, too, but that's neither here nor there.) So Temple decamped to a cabin in New York and took up the task himself, with a little help from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Projectors</a> drummer Mike Johnson and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28415-glass-ghost/"" target=""_blank"">Glass Ghost</a> keyboardist Eliot Krimsky.</p>
<p><i>Fool</i>'s little more than drum machine, bass, a Juno-1 synth, and Temple's boyish, Paul Simon-ized vocals. This relatively spartan setup finds Temple sounding looser and more relaxed than he has in quite some time. Here We Go Magic's precision plinking occasionally leads to a kind of fussiness; though frequently gorgeous, their everything-in-its-right-place presentations occasionally outshine their underlying melodies. From the start, <i>Good Mood Fool</i>'s considerably more playful and less particular than anything Temple's done in years, its production more spartan, less finicky, its songcraft sharp but not nearly as exacting. Opener ""Hard Working Hand"" is a more than passable stab at smoothed-out reggae; on a Burning Spear record, it'd stick out like a narc, but it's sharp enough to nick the sound without attempting to cop the spirit. ""Katie"", the restless pop-R&amp;B rave-up in the Billy Ocean tradition, is even better; as he pitches falsetto'd woo to the gal on his screen, the camshow-enraptured ""Katie"" is Temple's anxiety-ridden take on ""Ayo Technology"". The limber late-afternoon funk of the slinky, strutting ""Florida"" is another winner, sleek without succumbing to stiffness. In light of Temple's tightly wound, fastidiously arranged back catalog, this diverse, limber opening trio feels a bit out of character. But that's precisely the idea; these were the left-turns Temple felt he couldn't take with Magic, and they lead him to intriguing places.<br/><br/>There's an undercurrent of bitterness behind ""Those Kids"" keeping it from quite reaching the heights of the songs that precedes it. Describing a meeting with an MTV bigwig, Temple expresses frustration that his music hasn't caught on with either the gatekeepers or the titular youths. ""Kids"" closes with a chorus of backup singers mewling ""they're all such idiots""; it's a little unclear whether he means the Viacom brass or the young people he's not reaching, but in either case, the hints of vitriol seem at odds with the song's honeyed harmonies. The squirrely, sputtering ""Jessica Brown Findlay"" also seems to lose something in the lyrics. An homage of sorts to the ""Downton Abbey"" actress, ""Findlay"" starts out sweet enough. But when Temple starts in on Findlay's ""pineapple hair and deli-counter chest,"" things quickly turn icky. Temple, for all his musical particularities, can be a somewhat inscrutable lyricist. But even his more innocuous wordplay's vastly preferable to the oddly-pitched tangents that pepper <i>Good Mood Fool</i>. And closer ""Hardest Working Self-Made Mexican"" is certainly the set's strangest digression. The industrious immigrant at the center of the song is broadly drawn, more caricature than character, which leaves whatever point Temple hoped to make feeling muddled.<br/><br/>Marital post-script ""Sue"" is lovely, a doleful, clear-eyed look at a relationship gone awry, easily the best song on the album's second side. But ""Terrified Witness""—a sort of <i>No Nukes</i> song sung in retrospect—feels underwritten, and, at six minutes and change, the rigid groove of ""Love Won't Receive"" overstays its welcome. <i>Fool</i> starts out rangy and playful, but by its last few songs, the tone turns somber, and its ideas seem stretched a bit thin. It's telling, perhaps, that these three songs are the closest thing<i> Fool</i> has to Here We Go Magic tunes; they're fine and all, but Temple doesn't feel quite as enlivened by them as he does throughout the rest of the disc. A few awkward moments aside, <i>Fool </i>is at its best when Temple sounds the least like the Here We Go Magic guy; its buoyant, unfussy front half, out of character though it is, is up there with Temple's best work. Here's hoping Temple can bring a little of <i>Fool</i>'s cavalier, hey-why-not spirit into whatever he does next.</p></div>"|18717.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18717-luke-temple-good-mood-fool/|6.5|Paul Thompson

It might not be an especially deep concept, but take a listen: His <i>Caramel</i> sound quickly introduces itself. The album's title track begins with a deep voice, which is pitched down and smoothed out for a flirtatious monologue in the vein of Barry White. ""Oh, and what is this?"" Then, there's a coy giggle before Mockasin delivers a gentle, melodic howl (""ah-oooooo"") over a soulful, beatific, far-away synth. ""Welcome, this is <i>Caramel</i> album,"" the voice says. In a stereotypical universe, this is the moment where you're prompted to pick up the album's sleeve. Welcome. Take a moment to study Connan's platinum hair, pencil-thin mustache, and averted gaze. There he is, <a href=""http://image.thehothits.com/608x456/backstreet_boys_i_want_it_that_way_608x456.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dressed all in white</a>, swaddled in pillowy fabric. His stainless world is both unsettling and fitting; everything on ""Caramel"" shines. Each new instrument seems to come out thick and globby, gradually dribbling out with an adult contemporary sheen.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old New Zealand psych pop virtuoso recorded his sophomore album in a Tokyo hotel, and this time around, he's feeling sultry. He closes out the bridge of ""I'm the Man, That Will Find You"" by cooing a mostly unadorned falsetto. After one careening moment of calm, he moans and launches into the belted chorus with its slinky R&amp;B groove. It's the perfect sort of pause to force anticipation in a love song—a calm before a storm, a gaze before a conversation. Throughout <i>Caramel</i>, he's ready to employ sonic examples of human emotion (like sobbing and moaning), and he doesn't make those details subtle. As he proved on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15716-forever-dolphin-love/""><i>Forever Dolphin Love</i></a>, he's not afraid to go theatrical. Like a cartoon madman, he delivered a warbling, wide-eyed plea on that record: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ1E3qxBuec"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Please turn me into the snat""</a>. The title track of that album featured over 10 minutes of cluttered, kinetic, continuously shifting music. Connan's clearly got it in him to create a sizable, at times unsteady odyssey. </p>
<p><i>Caramel</i> is an album that demands patience. With a concept in mind, Mockasin seemed to be taking his time, playing the long game, establishing a gradually mutating mood. His broad view seems especially evident with his five-song ""It's Your Body"" suite—16 minutes with one abstract narrative wherein Connan forces the listener to slow down for a few lengthy slow jams. It takes over two full minutes of soporific minimalism to break into the primary melody of ""It's Your Body 1"". Then, things come to a standstill with the respectively loud and quiet (and equally stagnant) instrumentals on ""3"" and ""4"", which feel similar to the dragging mid-section of ""Why Are You Crying"". Thankfully, there are moments where Connan springboards into some well-executed, catchy grooves, like on ""Do I Make You Feel Shy"" and ""I'm the Man, That Will Find You"".</p>
<p>At the end of the ""It's Your Body"" suite, the melody resolves into that familiar beatific synth line from the title track. There's a petite voice repeating the words ""thank you Connan Mockasin"". The subsequent reply is loud, bursting out in that same voice from the title track: ""<i>Ahhhh</i>. You're very welcome."" The echo from that last word is intentionally overemphasized, ending with two very blunt repetitions: ""COME. [beat] COME."" Then, album closer ""I Wanna Roll With You"" kicks in with some cartoonishly sexual moans. It's tempting in that moment to nudge Connan toward the novelty bin, but he never quite makes it there. Instead, he occupies a similar space as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a>—a guy with offbeat sonic inclinations, a loudly absurd sense of humor, and a knack for writing ultra-weird soul songs. From the hair to the warped yacht rock soundscapes, comparisons to Ariel seem inevitable. Both men are weirdos and self-recorded savants whose careers will likely continue to take them to far-out, primary colored spaces. </p>
<p>When the moans clear away on ""Roll With You"", Connan delivers some quiet, mournful vocals (followed by, yes, a spoken word monologue where he says, innocently, ""Please, roll with me""). The word ""caramel"" is most readily embodied by this music's sensual, flirtatious leanings. Unfortunately, sometimes it seems to just mean ""slow"", i.e. the pace of swimming through caramel.</p></div>"|18748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18748-connan-mockasin-caramel/|6.7|Evan Minsker

The yin-yang dynamic that defined Neu!—drumming madman Klaus Dinger and the more meditative guitarist Michael Rother—couldn’t last forever, and each man’s subsequent solo work continued in diametrically-opposed directions, Dinger’s La Dusseldorf project manic and thunderous, Rother’s solo albums placid and elegant.</p>
<p>Back in 2009, duo Gerhard Michel and Gordon Pohl released <i>Hand in Hand</i>, their first album as Musiccargo. Much like fellow Germans Kreidler, Michel and Pohl were indebted to their countrymen’s influence (their website calls Michel “a student of Klaus Dinger”). Their debut emphasized electro with a krautrock drive underneath it, courtesy of Pohl’s sequencers and hardware. A smattering of remixes followed, but in the intervening four years, Musiccargo have stripped away all of that electro sheen.</p>
<p>Judging by the cover and artwork for their second full-length <i>Harmonie</i>, they now seek to bathe everything in pure white light. Released by England’s Emotional Response imprint (which was responsible for last year’s sterling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17442-tropical-psychedelics/"">Secret Circuit compilation</a>), Michel and Pohl favor austerity here, the warmth of acoustic instruments over components, organic over the electronic, or—if they must use such devices—analog versus digital, the drum machines mostly replaced by a real kit. There’s a clarity and intensity to every track here like bright eastern light in a parlor. One song title translates as “The Sun Shines On Everybody,” and that may very well be the duo’s intent this time around.</p>
<p>And yet where the assumption might be that Musiccargo would use the drums to conjure the now-departed spirit of Dinger, <i>Harmonie</i> both succeeds yet underwhelms because it instead relies on the sensibilities of Rother. Or rather, they emphasize the measured over the manic, not quite striking a balance. The nine opening minutes of “Domino” begin with audible human breath and windswept sounds, and slowly, carefully, cautiously begin to add more. Bird calls can be heard through the open space of the track and the wordless exhalations and clean, skyward guitar lines of Michel recall Rother’s side of <i>NEU! 3</i>, all proto-new age breathing and music as ocean waves, rising and falling. It’s a well-crafted and gorgeous piece, each gesture emphasized, but the track proceeds at the turning of a screw.</p>
<p>The sizzling cymbals of “La Era” also give the impression of breath, but at least here the track is quicker to escalate and reach the simmering (courtesy of more clanging percussion and plucked guitar) over the course of its eight minutes. More percussion bubbles up on side-ending “Das Buch” suggesting that the duo may soon be back to their danceable ways come the album’s back half. But “Tip Top” continues at the same measure, with more droning electronics low in the mix, chimes, and the most tactful use of a drum machine.</p>
<p>The incessant floor toms and electronic drones of “Sol Lucet Omnibus” bring to mind another krautrock act: Faust with minimalist composer/violinist Tony Conrad for <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Tony-Conrad-With-Faust-Outside-The-Dream-Syndicate/release/521825"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a one-off album back in 1973</a>. Backwards guitars and voices swirl, but the pacing never quickens. It mesmerizes, but also gives the impression that <i>Harmonie</i> operates better as a holistic listen than one of discreet “songs,” and it’s more satisfying when processed in such a manner.</p></div>"|18731.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18731-musiccargo-harmonie/|7.2|Andy Beta

Noise is a dissonant irritant, something that makes you wince momentarily and prompts you to plug your fingers in your ears as a defence mechanism. However, a Swans concert presents a symphony of cacophony from which even deafness provides no relief. Because Swans deal not in noise, but loudness—a gusty, wall-crumbling, tectonic-plate-shifting loudness that doesn’t so much give you a headache as an ulcer. As I discovered during a show last fall, even when you’re taking a mid-show piss in a bathroom that’s two storeys and several walls removed from the venue stage, Swans are still the most punishing band you’ve ever experienced.</p>
<p>But for all the abuse and misanthropy they project in concert, Swans consistently reward their fans’ tolerance with great acts of generosity. Compiled from the band’s 2012 world tours, <i>Not Here/Not Now</i> is the fourth release and second double-live album that Michael Gira has issued since reviving the Swans name in 2010, and like the previous concert document—2012’s <i>We Rose From Your Bed With the Sun in Our Head</i>—it’s a limited-edition, hand-crafted package that will help fund the next Swans studio opus. (And given that we got <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16964-the-seer/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Seer</i></a> out of the last deal, it’s no surprise that <i>Not Here/Not Now</i>’s first run sold out almost immediately. Though you can still donate to the cause by ponying up $500 for something even better than a mere record: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52639-swans-funding-new-album-with-live-record-and-more-michael-gira-will-write-a-song-about-you/"" target=""_blank"">a new Gira song written in your honour</a>.) But Swans live albums have come to represent more than just fancy souvenirs for charitable fans. They’re opportunities for Swans enthusiasts to observe the band’s ever-evolving aesthetic in action: Of the songs featured on <i>Not Here/Not Now</i>, only three have appeared on previous recordings. And any worries that Swans are showing too much of their hand are defused by the fact that new Swans songs rarely make it from the stage to record in the same form, and, once officially released, mutate even further in subsequent performances.</p>
<p>So if you’re wondering if you need another version of “The Seer”, the answer is: hell yes. After debuting as a brawny, pulsating rocker on <i>We Rose</i> and then transforming into the exotic, cinematically rendered 32-minute centerpiece of its 2012 namesake album, “The Seer” reappears on <i>Not Here/Not Now</i> as an oozing piece of toxic sludge that just gets thicker and nastier over its marathon 44-minute runtime, with two new songs bubbling up from its miasma: the scorched-earth psychedelia of “Bring the Sun” and “Toussaint L’ouverture”, a maniacal Francophone rant couched in an opium-den ambiance reminiscent of the comedown on Sonic Youth’s “Expressway to Yr. Skull”. But even those developments feel natural compared to what’s happened to “Oxygen”, a song that first surfaced as an acoustic meditation on Gira’s 2010 solo album <i>I Am Not Insane</i>, but has been unrecognizably reworked into a gut-punching, Jesus Lizardian rumble. (The original describes Gira’s experience with asthma; the new version <i>feels</i> like it.)</p>
<p>You can get a pretty good idea of where Swans are heading on their upcoming album from the lone 80s-era track that figures here: the <i>Holy Money</i>-era sludgefeast “Coward” is the perfect complement to the bone-crushing heft of new 10-minute dirge “Just a Little Boy”, which sounds even more like how you’d imagine a Melvins cover of David Bowie’s “Station to Station” would sound than <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pabmB-2SFsA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Melvins’ actual cover of “Station to Station”</a>. And that’s just the third-longest new song unveiled here: the stormy 16-minute opener “To Be Kind” sees Gira gravely repeating the title with the solemn cadence of a cantor, as if the sentiment expressed within was an impossible ideal; “She Loves Us!” deviously appropriates the title of a bygone Beatles hit in service of a 15-minute maelstrom that builds up a drum-battered drone into a mutant stoner-metal groove.</p>
<p>By comparison, the sand-swept drift of “Nathalie Neal” can’t help but feel like the least momentous of the new-album previews on offer here, but it serves as a logical bridge out of these caustic concert recordings into<i> Not Here/Not Now</i>’s pair of lo-fi acoustic-demo denouements. More than just expose the psych-folk underpinning of Swans’ seismic sound, the rough sketches for “Kirsten Supine” and “Screen Shot” offer a disarmingly intimate glimpse into Gira’s songwriting process, complete with his play-by-play, strum-by-strum commentary. After nearly two hours of being subjected to Swans’ highly orchestrated onstage onslaught, these human, off-the-cuff moments come as a great relief; in sharp contrast to the authoritative, stentorian presence Gira casts in concert, the demos present him in charmingly self-deprecating mode, questioning himself about what direction he should steer the song into, or even if it’s any good to begin with. Just as the double-tracked vocal incantations and needling acoustic jabs of “Screen Shot” approach peak hypnotic intensity, Gira stops the song cold and admits, “I have no idea where it’s going to go from there… but we’re going into the studio in a couple of weeks and we’ll figure it out.” Given Swans’ recent track record, those words feel less like glib reassurance than a distant early warning of what’s to come.</p></div>"|18712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18712-swans-not-herenot-now/|8.2|Stuart Berman

Another helping hand was lent by Mike Levy, the French producer who records and performs as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31453-gesaffelstein/"" target=""_blank"">Gesaffelstein</a>. He worked on the bruising, stadium-ready “Black Skinhead” and the raucous, emergency-lit “Send It Up” alongside label mate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30143-brodinski/"" target=""_blank"">Brodinski</a> and sonic grandfathers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>, among others.</p>
<p>A quick glimpse at Gesaffelstein’s professional mythology is all it takes to understand the heart of his appeal to West: a shared interest in art and fashion, a personal aesthetic possessed of palpable intensity and ripe with darkness and violence, and an eye towards intellectual concerns broader than music. (It’s captured neatly in his chosen moniker: Gesaffelstein is a portmanteau that combines the German word “gesamtkunstwerk,” meaning “universal artwork,” and Albert Einstein, an inspirational figure.) His debut album <i>Aleph</i> fuses those pre-existing aspirations to ideas about style that feel directly derived from his work with West, with its cover—a jewel case containing a gold disc, the case overlaid with complex patterns reminiscent of circuitry—serving as the most obvious hat tip.</p>
<p>It’s a testament to Levy’s talent, and to the strength of his sonic identity, that <i>Aleph</i> merits comparison to <i>Yeezus</i> in terms of its thematic consistency and coherence. From the ferocious spoken introduction that marks opener “Out of Line” (one of several appearances by Parisian vocalist Chloé Raunet) to the slowly rising sirens echoing throughout “Perfection”, this is an absolutely relentless record: there’s no sunlight to be had on <i>Aleph</i>. Levy specializes in two types of songs: fiery, raging bangers meant for the dank club at the end of the world, and meditative mood pieces that bubble and loom while you’re fighting through the next morning’s hangover. Thoughtful sequencing choices help to amplify the magnitude of the difference between the members of these phylums, and have the added benefit of lending <i>Aleph</i> a natural-seeming cycle of attack and release. When doom-soaked, muscular lead single “Pursuit” glides into the ominous, slowly shifting “Nameless”, it’s as if we’ve been given a well-earned breather after enduring the intense assault of the former.</p>
<p>It’s a trick Levy pulls multiple times without diluting its effect, made possible by the tonal differences between the album’s higher-octane tracks: “Send It Up” relative “Hellifornia” pairs a trunk-ratting hip-hop rhythm with a howling, DEFCON 1-level screech, while “Duel” earns its combative title by pitting a furious, hyper-kinetic beat against a friction-fried synth that refuses to let up. While the album’s dark, dance-ready techno cuts certainly demand their fair share of attention, Levy takes advantage of the album’s quieter moments and displays surprising levels of subtlety and restraint. With its eerie guitar melodies and digital choruses of the damned, the title track could slot neatly into a collection of outtakes from the <i>Drive</i> soundtrack; mid-album counterpart “Wall of Memories” fares even better, bulging and warping underneath a haunted piano line. By making room for both potential floor-filling wrecking balls and quieter, spookier moments on <i>Aleph</i>, Levy sets himself up as the sort of transcendental figure who can fill up festival EDM tents full of drop enthusiasts while simultaneously appealing to listeners who consider themselves more nuanced consumers of contemporary electronic material.</p>
<p>If<span><i> Aleph</i> has a weakness, it's the album's lack of concision. At around an hour, this is a lengthy, demanding record, and the relentless push that constitutes a major part of its excitement in small blocks renders it somewhat exhausting when ingested as a whole. While some of the strongest songs—the stomach-churning “Hate or Glory”, the piston-powered techno workout “Trans”—are tucked near its conclusion, it takes an effort to make it to the finish line. The importance of brevity is a lesson Levy didn't pickup after working on <i>Yeezus</i>, a similarly dark record that clocks in at a brisk 40 minutes. A distillation of the sounds and themes contained within <i>Aleph</i> into an equally slim package would render his next record truly fearsome.</span></p></div>"|18747.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18747-gesaffelstein-aleph/|7.8|Jamieson Cox

The National's sound has always been mellow and rich,  a rock band as a foaming, blooming cup of pour-over coffee. Dessner's sensibility churns like stomach acid. <br/><br/><i>Aheym</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, Dessner's collaboration with contemporary- classical hip-uncle figures</span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6375-kronos-quartet/"" target=""_blank""> the Kronos Quartet</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, is the result of a working relationship that dates back a few years. Three of its four pieces were written specifically for Kronos, and the title track has been a fixture of their concerts for a few years now. ""Aheym"" begins with all four members digging into their strings and producing hard, sinewy </span><i>sforzandos</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, or sudden, violent accents, before subsiding quickly into an agitated, seething hum. The cello plays lopsided arpeggios, each one nervously edging forward, while pizzicato prickles tension higher. It is fierce, vivid music.<br/><br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">The rock-friendly post-minimalism of Bang on a Can looms heavy over Dessner's work, but that's less a statement on Dessner's originality than BOAC's sheer ubiquity. BOAC's long-running All-Stars summer program is the feeder college largely responsible for populating the indie sphere with conservatory rockers like Dessner in the first place. But they aren't the only audible reference point:  ""Little Blue Something"" traces lightly bowed figures in the cello against warm surges from the rest of the ensemble, and the effect is like a more earthbound Arvo P<span id=""docs-internal-guid-3a602753-3416-56c8-17e9-17a4c1ad5794""><span>ä</span></span>rt. P<span id=""docs-internal-guid-3a602753-3416-56c8-17e9-17a4c1ad5794""><span>ä</span></span>rt's touch pops up multiple places, like in the spidery refractions of harmonics that cloud the air in the thirteenth minute of ""Tenebre"", or the way sobbing vibrato bowing condenses from a dry mist of harmonics on ""Aheym.""<br/><br/></span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">It's only with the final piece, ""Tour Eiffel,"" that the tension in Dessner's work recedes. The piece is a setting of a poem by Chilean poet Vicente Huidobro, sung by the Brooklyn Youth Chorus. Opening with just the chorus, the piece nudges into dewily picked guitars and some piano, offering the only glimpse of a sound world related, however distantly, to Dessner's band. The textures glow softly, the choir coos, and the ensemble dances inventively between minimalism and something like recognizable song form. There is no obvioustime-stamp on the work, which keeps surging in new directions, making interesting new things happen. Dessner is part of a chummy coterie of musicians, like Annie Clark of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"" target=""_blank"">St. Vincent</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> and Dave Longstreth of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1196-dirty-projectors/"" target=""_blank"">Dirty Projectors</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, and sometimes the air inside the clubhouse can get a little thick. But Dessner's mordant vision is uniquely his; these are real, meaty works, troubling and beautiful. </span></div>

Along with the likes of the breathtaking <i>É</i><i>thiopiques</i> series and Strut’s relentlessly funky <i>Nigeria 70</i> set from 2001, the compilation helped spur a revival in African music from the continent’s “Golden Age,” that time in the 1960s and 70s when European imperialism was for the most part eradicated, artists and culture flourished, and before many of these nations’ leaders turned despotic. That renaissance has continued on into the present moment, from the work of imprints like Analog Africa, Soundway, and Awesome Tapes from Africa (to name just a few of many active reissue labels), even as Africa’s embarrassment of riches has turned into a glut of sorts, a decidedly First World problem to have.</p>
<p>In those intervening years, Luaka Bop tried with little success to track down William Onyeabor, whose “Better Change Your Mind” appeared on both their comp and the <i>Nigeria 70 </i>set. Little info could be found about the man, though the reports varied wildly: he studied cinematography in Russia, he self-financed his own movie, he was a titan of industry in his native Nigeria with a flour mill, he had business interests in Sweden. About the only thing for certain was that Onyeabor self-released eight albums from 1977-1985 at an annual report clip, before disavowing music for Christianity. Since then, Onyeabor’s music has been bootlegged while original copies can go for upwards of $500 online.</p>
<p>Previous decades have led to re-appraisals of the likes of King Sunny Ade, Ali Farka Touré, Youssou N’Dour, Salif Keita, and Fela Kuti, and Luaka Bop’s handy new set <i>Who is William Onyeabor?</i> (the first legitimate reissue of his music) posits the man for a 21st century audience, where his sonic sensibilities seem best suited. While those aforementioned African icons gained renown on the world music circuit for their guitar work, their distinct voices, their rhythmic innovations, Onyeabor favored an instrument rarely heard from the African Diaspora, the analog synthesizer. </p>
<p>An array of keyboards can be seen on the cover of Onyeabor’s final album <i>Anything You Sow </i>and across the man's discography, they evolve from serving as accompaniment to becoming the primary instrument. “Something You Will Never Forget” features a crisp backbeat, Afrobeat horn skronk, and Onyeabor’s organ in roller rink mode, the most conventional song on the set. But on opener “Body and Soul” (a longtime dancefloor staple) Onyeabor tickles the keys then warps them until they sound like an inter-dimensional portal in the midst of the song’s slinking groove. It happens again five minutes into his biggest “hit,” “Atomic Bomb” a heavily wah-wah’d keyboard doing its best Bernie Worrell when-the-Mothership-lands impression.</p>
<p>All but one of the comp’s nine tracks comes in under six minutes (with three topping the 10-minute mark), and most of the songs are structured similarly, at times making the set feel same-y. A steady, boxy drum rhythm (some utilizing drum machine), smatterings of guitar, a bevy of female back-up singers doing call and responses with Onyeabor’s naïf yet endearing English lyrics, but central to each track is Onyeabor’s synth work. The closest comparison to this set might be that of Indian guitarist-turned synth enthusiast Charanjit Singh’s 1982 album <i><a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Charanjit-Singh-Synthesizing-Ten-Ragas-To-A-Disco-Beat/release/2108668"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Synthesizing: </a></i><a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Charanjit-Singh-Synthesizing-Ten-Ragas-To-A-Disco-Beat/release/2108668"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat</i></a>, which no doubt sounded like a rinky-dink curio during its time, but in hindsight was revealed to have anticipated acid and techno by a number of years so that by the time of its reissue it sounded downright revelatory to 21st century listeners. Similarly, Onyeabor’s strange use of the synthesizer as embellishment presages that of any number of outsider electronic music producers by three decades. It’s little wonder that the likes of Four Tet, James Holden, Caribou and more have already been buzzing with their accolades for the man and the weird funk of “Fantastic Man” could easily be mistaken for a modern Dam-Funk track.</p>
<p>Whereas Sunny Ade’s singular guitar tone could be as mighty and rippling as a river and Fela Kuti and Tony Allen’s Afrobeat was a force of nature, Onyeabor’s music often times sounds warbling and flimsy, economical and tinny. Some of this might come from the set drawing on vinyl sources rather than master tapes, but knowing of the man’s imminent Christian conversion, it’s not a stretch to see parallels between Onyeabor’s organ tone and those of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18182-good-god-aprocryphal-hymns/"">private-pressed religious records</a>. Onyeabor’s sound is as homemade and insular as anything on last year’s <a href=""http://www.mtvhive.com/2012/04/27/personal-space-soul-compilation/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Personal Space</i> compilation</a>, as strange and extraterrestrial as that of Sun Ra. <i>Who is William Onyeabor?</i> doesn't provide any answers its own posited question, but the mystery and wonder of the man’s music remains intact.</p></div>"|18732.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18732-william-onyeabor-who-is-william-onyeabor/|8.6|Andy Beta

They had some terrific moments in the 90s—seek out 1993's deliciously murky<i> In Search of Manny</i> EP—but rarely shook off their reputation as a satellite of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19278-beastie-boys/"" target=""_blank"">the Beastie Boys</a>. (Grand Royal released all of their original records, and drummer Kate Schellenbach had been the Beasties' original drummer.) When the group lost keyboardist Vivian Trimble in 1998, then punched out after releasing the unspectacular <i>Electric Honey</i>, they seemed to have stuck around exactly long enough.</p>
<p>Bassist Jill Cunniff and guitarist Gabby Glaser both released solo albums in 2007; sometime around then, they got together to work up some children's music, but couldn't find a convenient way to release it. Last year, they ran a crowdfunding campaign to make a new Luscious Jackson album—this one. (The children's album, <i>Baby DJ</i>, will apparently be out soon.)</p>
<p>The 2013 edition of Luscious Jackson sounds less like a band than like friends who used to be in a band together. Glaser and Cunniff recorded their parts of <i>Magic Hour</i> in New York, and Schellenbach's drums were added in Los Angeles. (Trimble's sitting this one out again.) Their best songs of the '90s, from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLv8EjfmbBg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Daughters of the Kaos""</a> to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NhqN0KcWAE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Naked Eye""</a>, often seemed like constellations of new and borrowed hooks that miraculously fit together into songs. This album, though, is pretty obviously a creation of Pro Tools (which Cunniff learned in order to record it). One track after another cycles through mix-and-match riffs and catchphrases for a few minutes, then evaporates when its three minutes are up. At least their new material doesn't suffer from reunion bloat: all but two of the album's ten tracks clock in under 3:15.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, a lot of Cunniff and Glaser's lyrics these days are about the durability of their partnership. ""We're better together, you and me,"" goes <i>Magic Hour</i>'s first song; another one features the lyric ""we go back but we can't go back/ but we can go on."" There are a handful of likeable, more or less interchangeable let's-party tunes, most of which involve some nifty guitar playing from Glaser. (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEkFC2lkLXI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""So Rock On""</a> is the one that the Beasties' Adam Horovitz contributed to, and involves the ""woo-hah"" cadence that Busta Rhymes lifted from the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qB7O6c5Uycw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sugarhill Gang</a>; ""Show Us What You Got"" is the one with an old-school syndrum breakdown; ""Are You Ready"" is the one that mentions <i>Dancing with the Stars</i>.) There's also a novelty song, the ass-watching anthem <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd669AlC-cU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""#1 Bum""</a>, which wears out its welcome in a hurry.</p>
<p><i>Magic Hour</i> isn't saddening or frustrating in the way that cash-in reunions can be (and the band's clearly not doing it to cash in). It's just a return to very familiar territory without the urgency and mystery of Luscious Jackson's 90s-era music--the Lollapalooza Nation equivalent of, say, a new Winger or Y&amp;T album. For the most part, it even sounds like it was fun to make; if only it were as much fun to hear.</p></div>"|18692.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18692-luscious-jackson-magic-hour/|5.6|Douglas Wolk

But he has since found his own voice, most notably on the revelatory first edition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16425-action-bronson-blue-chips/"" target=""_blank""><i>Blue Chips</i></a>. Where Ghostface was a deliriously inscrutable writer playing the role of a wily narrator unspooling street narratives, Bronson is a larger-than-life character in his own songs. He eats tacos in foreign countries and fixes college football and NBA games alike, and in unmooring himself from the grim realities that ground the classic 90s New York rap his own music sprouts from, Bronson’s art began to flourish.</p>
<p>But there is still a balance the Queens MC must navigate, which became obvious on June’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18186-action-bronson-saaab-stories/"" target=""_blank""><i>Saaab Stories</i></a>, a seven-song collaborative EP with the producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31329-harry-fraud/"" target=""_blank"">Harry Fraud</a>. The Bronson character revels in worldly luxury but also in the slimy underbelly of gangster fabula, one in which women are uniformly paid for their services and rendered as objects. This was driven home by the album’s bizarre cover, in which two models were posed as props in compromising positions. But the problem runs deeper: there is a distinct distastefulness to Bronson’s music, and it is accentuated nearly to the point of disgust when the production become steely and dark, as it is across most of <i>Saaab Stories</i> and 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17375-rare-chandeliers/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rare Chandeliers</i></a>, a project helmed by The Alchemist. These beats bend his stories back toward the reality of a group like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4755-mobb-deep/"" target=""_blank"">Mobb Deep</a>, a dynamic that does not cast a flattering light on the imagined vulgarities that punctuate Bronson’s writing.</p>
<p>The initial <i>Blue Chips—</i>with the producer Party Supplies sourcing samples from YouTube and stitching them together with the seams showing—was tonally perfect. At its best, the world Bronson creates is colorful and comical, and in Party Supplies he has found a partner eager to bring that characteristic to its literal endpoint with a crackling production aesthetic that casts the rapper as the star of a rogue Saturday morning cartoon. With the just-released <i>Blue Chips 2</i> they don’t tinker with the formula, and the result is a sequel nearly as good as its predecessor.</p>
<p>Party Supplies’ light, humorous touch also seems to enliven Bronson’s writing, extracting out of him scenes that are as cinematic as they are ridiculous. When he raps, “Swimming trunk, 30k in arm’s reach/ I’m on the boat in the water like a swan’s feet” on “The Don’s Cheek” I can picture the ripples in the water slowly emanating. I want a line like, “Speaking Arabic in Greece/ Grown men turn the keys to cheese as I water ski Belize” extracted and fleshed out to an entire HBO series. When Bronson is peaking as he often is on <i>Blue Chips 2</i> there’s stuff like this all over the place: “Play your poker on the riverboat/ Hit the ace, long rifle in my bitch’s coat/ Flip off the balcony, knife to the throat/ Ice in the Coke/ Coke on the table, wildin’ out in Roanoke.”</p>
<p>Where punchline rappers can falter is in prioritizing the joke instead of something larger, turning rap into a bastardized version of stand-up comedy. Bronson is not immune to this himself, but on <i>Blue Chips 2</i> his one-twos (“Shoot eagles on the Jack Nicklaus course/ Porsche with the triple exhaust”) become little dioramas, and eventually over the course of an hour he constructs a mutated version of the world we recognize—this is the escapism not of Rick Ross, but of Pixar. The punchlines can stagger individually, but when the album ends it can take a minute for the mind to readjust itself to reality.</p>
<p>The first collaboration between Party Supplies and Action Bronson was “Contemporary Man"", a four-minute one-off in which the two recreate rap’s culture of radio freestyles but with instrumentals of 80s classics like “Sussudio” and “Sledgehammer"". The track is wedged into the middle of <i>Blue Chips 2</i>, and it comes off as the guiding spirit of a project that also features Bronson rapping over the Champs’ “Tequila” and Tracy Chapman’s “Give Me One Reason"". As a jukebox cypher, “Contemporary Man” was the first hint that Bronson might be a bit more than just another witty New York rapper.</p>
<p>But more than anything, the song—and concurrently the album that now houses it—is just a whole lot of fun. Bronson, for whatever reason, only seems to hit this note with Party Supplies in his back pocket. But when he does, his music is not only a blast, but undeniably distinctive.</p></div>"|18727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18727-action-bronson-blue-chips-2/|8.0|Jordan Sargent

But while he certainly excels at the role of the Eurotrash slimeball, he actually has a far broader range than that. A devotee of Serge Gainsbourg, Tellier has inherited the master’s ambitious genre-hopping habit (as well as his arch-Gallic oleaginity), and aside from house-y synthpop he’s recorded Gainsbourg-style baroque pop, slightly skewed takes on contemporary radio pop, an album of piano ballads, and a film score.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For his new <i>Confection</i>, Tellier returns to his role as a composer for film in spirit, if not in actual fact, and combines it with <i>Sexuality</i>’s pursuit of bygone erotic aesthetics. Long story short, it sounds like the soundtrack to a 70s French porn movie that, as far as I can tell, doesn’t actually exist.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If it did exist, it would probably look a lot like <i>Emmanuelle</i>, the X-rated blueprint that a decade of soft-focus European (or at least “European”) erotica was based on, as well as the highest-grossing French film of 1974. <i>Confection</i> is reminiscient of <i>Emmanuelle</i>’s soundtrack, composed by Pierre Bachelet, which at its most compelling parts combines French pop crooning, 70s soft rock, and syrupy strings in a way that’s nearly as good as any of the movie’s visuals when it comes to evoking a certain luxurious, but seedy, erotic sensibility.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>“Adieu” opens the album with cloying strings, a swooningly romantic piano, and wordless vocals by a female opera singer, all moving at a decadently slow pace that heavily suggests Vaseline lenses, gratuitous slow-motion, and proudly unmanaged body hair. The music is</span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> schmaltzy, tacky stuff, and Tellier piles it on deliriously, reaching for the point where it tips over from simple camp into the realm of the sublimely sleazy, and frequently surpassing it. At a time where musicians from the nether reaches of the electronic music underground all the way to the top of the Hot 100 are pushing an agenda of radical minimalism, </span><i>Confection</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> is a fantastically decadent album. Most of the songs are festooned with gooey strings, and the ones that aren’t, like the brief solo piano piece “Curiosa"" still ooze melodrama.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>However decadent as the songs sound, they still pale in comparison to the depravity of the album itself, whose purpose is hard to pin down. While it’s certain to thrill the avid fans who over the years have formed a small cult around vintage porno soundtracks, the average listener’s likely to simply be baffled. It’s not a dance record by any stretch, and there’s really only one track, “L'amour naissant"", meets the accepted standard for an actual pop song, with a drumbeat and vocals and everything.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And if Tellier intended it to function as mood music for some kind of retro-Euro-porn sexual encounter, he probably shouldn’t have tossed in a waltz arranged for solo analog synthesizer halfway through—its creepy, circus-like vibe and squelching electronic tones are almost guaranteed to spoil the mood.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Confection</i>’s overall theme is indulgence, and there’s nothing more indulgent than an artist using a whole album to explore a personal obsession that only a fraction of his fans will be capable of enjoying. It feels like a very French-pop-star gesture, extravagant and essentially useless, and perversely enjoyable for exactly those reasons.</span></p></div>"|18714.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18714-sebastian-tellier-confection/|6.3|Miles Raymer

She had a story to tell, after all, and it was an important one, a saga that she said would take a dozen albums, lined together in her <i>Coin Coin </i>series. More or less, the odyssey is that of her extended family’s ascent in North America, from Transatlantic servitude through the Jim Crow South and onto her present role as one of the most exciting new spirits in contemporary music. And so <i>Coin Coin’s </i>first episode, the 2011 album <i>Gens De Couleur Libres</i>, featured <a href=""http://cstrecords.com/cst079/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">15 other musicians</a>, collected from Montreal bands such as Land of Kush and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3787-a-silver-mt-zion/"" target=""_blank"">A Silver Mt. Zion</a> and assembled in the Hotel2Tango, where Roberts recorded live in front of an audience. The audacious set pitted shrieking, incensed post-bop against moody, mournful atmospherics, plaintive balladry against electrified indignation. This aggressive hodgepodge of styles—“panoramic sound quilting,” Roberts calls it—suited her cause: to revisit her ancestor’s days as slaves in the South, being sold on the auction block and forced to find a new faith, and then to press on. The material was stormy and angry, beautiful and forlorn, a wide beginning for an admittedly lengthy trip. </p>
<p><i>Mississippi Moonchile</i>, the second installment of Roberts’ <i>Coin Coin</i> series, is consistently smaller. This time, for instance, the ensemble backing Roberts is only a quintet, culled from the improvisational ranks of New York and Boston. It’s a relatively traditional group, too, with her alto saxophone often dovetailing or countering the trumpet of Jason Palmer. Bassist Thomson Kneeland and drummer Tomas Fujiwara make for an adaptable rhythm section, capable of effortless undulation and knotty zigs. Pianist Shoko Nagai possesses similar versatility, her careful, cloudy chords sometimes giving over to spastic, assailant lines. (There’s an opera singer, Jeremiah Abiah, here, too, but more on that in a bit.)</p>
<p>And if <i>Gens De Couleur Libres </i>was an envelope of eternity, with no clear beginning except for time itself, <i>Mississippi Moonchile </i>focuses on the life of Roberts’ grandmother, a poor Southern girl who grew up in an era of keen turbulence that spanned the Great Depression, World War II, and America’s crawl toward civil rights. Roberts interviewed her grandmother about growing up in that time and place. She speak-sings excerpts of the testimony off-and-on throughout these pieces, integrating the memories with Bible verses, recognizable colloquialisms, and civil rights dialogue. The net effect suggests <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/15/fiction.jamesbaldwin"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">James Baldwin’s first novel, <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i></a>, in which the young, black author used a mix of history and fiction to trace the relatives he knew back to the Southern slaves he did not. Baldwin had the written word for his mission; Roberts, a fitting emissary, has a century of jazz. <i> </i></p>
<p>Neither the size and standardization of this ensemble nor the focus of Roberts’ timeline make <i>Mississippi Moonchile</i> less audacious than its predecessor. Instead, this set runs uninterrupted for 49 minutes through 18 tracks, a compositional feat made more impressive by the way the suite moves so fluidly between the segmented past of its jazz predecessors. Roberts is a meticulous and comprehensive composer, but this music ricochets with the intensity of free jazz and dives smoothly into Sunday afternoon sessions. <i>Mississippi Moonchile</i> boasts impeccable melodies and excoriating variations, cantering rhythms, and debilitating breakdowns. Here, it’s possible to trace the influence of Count Basie and Albert Ayler, John Coltrane and Louis Armstrong, the Art Ensemble of Chicago and Mahalia Jackson, all on the same reverent level. On “Woman Red Racked”, she twists <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=Nn6y4iHj6_MC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;dq=%22i+know+your+house+feels+lonesome%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-BYpBo1gA6&amp;sig=17Afy52ifXWkhe0DW6cMTChwbH0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iWB0UpTkFM_MsQTO_oDABA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22i%20know%20your%20house%20feels%20lonesome%22&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an antediluvian Southern blues</a> into a surreal call-and-answer; for the closer, “Benediction”, she turns the <a href=""http://cyberhymnal.org/htm/i/t/g/itgarden.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">familiar words and tune</a> of a praise song into a soul-settling balm after a gauntlet of assailant horns and unsteady drums. That continuum approach—blurring ancient history into the rather recent past, and pulling both at once into the present—fits Roberts’ widescreen vision of history and of herself. That is the core of the <i>Coin Coin</i> effort: This work is neither about Roberts nor her family. It’s about anyone who’s ever tried to understand how they arrived in their own peculiar position.</p>
<p>That, of course, is no easy proof, which is where Jeremiah Abiah, the operatic tenor, comes in. His bellow is deep but dynamic, stretching upward in crescents and dipping low to add textural density to this album’s otherwise acoustic sound. Interview transcripts and pinball approach notwithstanding, he is the esoteric addition—and, arguably the most important one. After listening to <i>Mississippi Moonchile</i> a few times, try to imagine the same material without him: no distended vibrato passages during “Confessor Haste”, no expressive paroxysms during the brief “All Nations”, no ruptured moans during the valley of “Lesson”. The music seems too clean and too clear that way, as though this aggregate of American anecdotal and musical history is now a complete lesson, a lecture meant simply to be studied and redelivered later on an exam.</p>
<p>But Roberts knows better than that. Remember, this is<i> her</i> family, and even she quotes her grandmother time and again saying, “There are some things I just can’t tell you about, honey.” Indeed, for all the seismic variety here, that admission of the unknowable serves as this record’s leitmotif—we can hear about the hardships (the need for rain and the dearth of education) and the small joys (the fruits and the arrival of plumbing), but we can never really know them entirely. Abiah imparts an intentional opacity, then, a means to push this part of the story to an obfuscated end. Roberts doesn’t want us getting too comfortable with this history, as though we’ve dealt with its perils. “You can use these stories and narratives as a way to express a past but also a present,” she told <i>The Wire</i> earlier this year, speaking about the subversive ways slavery still exists. “And, what’s really interesting, what I hope to parlay the work into more, is using it as a platform [to address] these other forms of slavery that are continuing on.” That is, we’ve got our own problems to worry about now. With <i>Coin Coin, </i>Roberts—a history buff with a bold vision for the moment—has 10 more volumes to approach them. </p></div>"|18706.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18706-matana-roberts-coin-coin-chapter-two-mississippi-moonchile/|8.1|Grayson Currin

On the assortment of EPs, remixes, DJ mixes, and singles the duo’s released over the past four years, they’ve displayed a preoccupation with exploring how disparate elements act when they’re combined: organic sounds blended with laser-precise sequencing, Chicago footwork with Angolan kuduro, experimental ideas with floor-filling beats. They’re good at it, too, showing an eye not just for the synergy the mixes produce, but also for the interesting bits of friction they create.</p>
<p>Lately they’ve been investigating a different set of contrasts. It seems like as their work making beats for other artists has taken off (recent clients include <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31712-kelela/"" target=""_blank"">Kelela</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30311-le1f/"" target=""_blank"">Le1f</a>), they’ve been able to satisfy their traditional pop urges, and so given the opportunity to do something under their own name, they’ve decided to let their headier ambitions run free. On this seven-song EP, <i>Skycell</i>, the experiment yielded mixed results.</p>
<p>Like a number of their contemporaries on dance music’s leading edge (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30213-the-drum/"" target=""_blank"">the-Drum</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30667-ryan-hemsworth/"" target=""_blank"">Ryan Hemsworth</a> among them), Pineda and Maroof have started to allow their compositions to stray further from the typical 16-bar intervals of build and release that largely define the genre. The songs here unfold gradually, settling into more organic-feeling configurations than the cycles of loops that shape most other kinds of electronic dance music. The songs on <i>Skycell</i> move up and down like dance tracks usually do, but they also move subtly in other dimensions, like the shifts in the rhythm’s center of gravity that give their beats a woozy kind of 3-D effect, and melodies seem to come and go as they please.</p>
<p>This strategy offers major benefits, like the cinematic scope that comes along with it, intimating that there’s some kind of narrative lurking behind the music. You don’t need the EP's suggestive title and CG cover art to get the feeling that there’s some sort of science-fictional aspect to<i> Skycell</i>. A majority of the songs here have at least one part that sounds like something straight off a multiplex soundtrack: the spy-movie piano riff underpinning “Vision of Completion”, or the jittery little string figure in “Harp Bell” that replicates the anxious crackle of a crisply edited heist scene.</p>
<p>Then again there are some negative consequences as well. While its cinematic qualities are entertaining, the more soundtracky moments can be distracting, and don’t always hold up to repeat listens. And the tracky repetition that Pineda and Maroof have largely abandoned here can actually be a good thing, especially when it comes to dance music—it’s easier to dance to a song when you have an idea of where it’s going.</p>
<p><i>Skycell</i> remains an impressive listen, though, and the sci-fi elements contribute to that. One of Nguzunguzu’s trademarks is their ability to make sequenced, programmed music sound like a living, breathing thing. The tone of their samples, which often incorporate acoustic, round-edged analog synths, and field recordings (or at least exceptionally good reproductions), is a large part of that. But, additionally, there’s something about <i>Skycell</i>’s synthesis of the technological and the biological that approaches the uncanny—for some reason, the chirping bird that shows up halfway through “Tumultuous” made me think of the human-engineered replica animals in <i>Blade Runner</i>, where the biological and technological combine to make something that’s not quite either. It’s a creepy feeling, one that's fascinating enough to keep revisiting.</p></div>"|18710.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18710-nguzunguzu-skycell/|7.0|Miles Raymer

That's a preposterous amount of time, even when you consider everything that the two members of epochal Bay Area indie rap duo Latyrx have been up to in the interim. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2579-lyrics-born/"" target=""_blank"">Lyrics Born</a> has lent his good-natured conversational virtuosity to a string of adequate-to-great solo albums (great-to-adequate if you're going chronologically). <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17670-lateef-the-truth-speaker/"" target=""_blank"">Lateef the Truth Speaker</a>'s gruff fluidity, meanwhile, was typically paired with specific one-producer one-offs and/or short-lived supergroups—think Maroons or the Mighty Underdogs. But consider everything that's happened in underground hip-hop over that stretch: labels have risen and fallen, more than a dozen different movements, regions, subgenres, and styles have infiltrated each other, and the Solesides/Quannum collective that launched some of the best hip-hop records of the late 90s has largely receded into the background. Why that is owes a little to the fickleness of enduring fashionability in hip-hop, even the alt-rap sectors—but long-term inspiration isn't a common commodity, either.</p>
<p>That could explain why <i>The Second Album </i>feels so scattered and frantic. Lateef and Lyrics Born would sound pretty good just going on cruise control, letting their acrobatic, complementary flows hold the weight and making even workaday lyrics seem spectacular. To their credit, they don't come across like the complacent types who would resort to slacking like that—but ambition without inspiration can lead into some pretty ridiculous places, all hacky-sack silliness and earnestness so overbearing it actually sounds false. It doesn't matter how trendy their blend of political indie-minded lyricism and lighthearted, rib-poking internal punchlines is or isn't; what matters is that the strain to outdo themselves drives them to undo themselves instead. It's the difference between getting lifted by good-vibe sunshiney rap, and getting thrown by constantly being asked if you're having a good time.</p>
<p>This overreach grates because it doesn't allow much room for nuance, or setup, or much breathing room at all, really. The way opener “Arrival” muddles its comeback narrative/populist defiance in Hooray for Everything stream-of-consciousness leaves behind the mildly buzzy vapor of what could either be a call to arms or a frozen yogurt commercial. That vagueness is ramped up by a scattered sociopolitical POV that takes loose feints at broad issues: gun culture's drawbacks, tragedies and consequences are yammered out to empty rapidfire effect in “Reload"", and the obvious punchline of “The Power of Rumor (Leonard Is Lost)”—a mysterious posted message that leads to riots and media overkill turns out to be for a lost cat—builds a cautionary tall tale out of frivolous hyperbole that's as funny as a cinderblock to the foot. Even when things divert more towards the day-to-day ordinary, like the pseudo-virtuoso rap-about-rap-about-rap “Deliberate Gibberish” (“Look at little ol' me/ I'm a unicorn king/ And my heart on my sleeve/ And a card up my sleeve/ Tell me what does that mean?”) or the unrequited love lament “Electric Chair” (“We're so close I see my reflection in your brown eyes/ Yet so far apart I might as well be on an asteroid”), there's this weird sense of the lyrics trying to be deadly serious and lightheartedly amusing at the same time, while failing at both.</p>
<p>With that in mind, the production almost seems like an afterthought, even if some of the names hold promise. Anticon vet Jel provides some decently low-end-reliant futurist space-funk on “Arrival” and “Reload,” the instrumentals of which would've fit in well with the solid <i>Late Pass </i>album he dropped earlier this year. And bringing in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27618-tune-yards/"" target=""_blank"">tUnE-yArDs</a> to give Merrill Garbus' swirling loop-driven builds a more explicit hip-hop context was an inspired move, even if the relative minimalism of “Watershed Moment"", with its sparse vocal harmonies and reliance on a stark drum loop, is a better fit than the manic “O Superman” gasps on “Deliberate Jibberish”. But those two producers' divergent styles are already enough at odds with each other, and filling out the rest of the production slate on <i>The Second Album </i>with similarly grab-bag sounds keeps things frustratingly scattered.</p>
<p>The album's home stretch gets the most ridiculous with it: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1043-the-decemberists/"" target=""_blank"">the Decemberists</a>' Chris Funk fiddles around with gothic bongo breaks on “Sometimes Why?”, Future People's generic indie-electro-pop runs through “Every Man for Himself”, some low-key riffage from Living Colour's Corey Glover is the only sign of life in the emo-hop trudge of “Electric Chair"", and the closing “Gorgeous Spirits (Aye Let's Go)” is grotesque caricaturized circa-'06 hyphy that doesn't do justice to Lateef, Lyrics Born, hyphy, the Bay, 2006, or anything else it touches. This isn't the Latyrx that won over backpackers and Cali-funk fans back in '97—far from it. It's not much of a reunion, that's for sure, and sixteen years is a long time to wait for a sophomore slump. </p></div>"|18697.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18697-latyrx-the-second-album/|4.8|Nate Patrin

As such, Em’s last decade worth of albums has suffered under jarring shifts in tone. After showing his first signs of wear with 2004’s patchy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2772-encore/"" target=""_blank""><i>Encore</i></a>, Eminem rebounded with 2009’s Dre-beats-and-horrorcore-rhymes retrenchment <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13034-relapse/"" target=""_blank""><i>Relapse</i></a>. <i>Relapse </i>sold well but its serial killer shtick was uninspired, as Eminem openly admitted on the next year’s “Not Afraid” (“That last <i>Relapse </i>CD was ‘enh’”). 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14380-recovery/"" target=""_blank""><i>Recovery</i></a> maneuvered out of <i>Relapse </i>and <i>Encore</i>’s chum bucket humor by detailing the artist’s struggle to overcome a long-simmering prescription drug dependency. Serious Eminem proved a drag despite <i>Recovery</i> couching its penitent 12-step dispatches in rivulets of the usual Slim Shady chicanery, so here we are staring down a once-more radioactive blonde Eminem’s <i>Marshall Mathers LP 2</i>.</p>
<p><i>The Marshall Mathers LP 2</i> is an album-length bout of moral recidivism, <i>Recovery</i>’s motivational rehab narrative ditched wholesale for a second helping of the celeb-hating, self-deprecating juvenalia of Eminem’s beloved third album peppered with samples of and references to the source material. Opener “Bad Guy” is a sprawling epic that finds the brother of “Stan”’s titular obsessed fan hatching an elaborate revenge plot, and “Parking Lot” inexplicably revisits the heist in the middle of “Criminal” to inform us that the getaway driver split, and the shooter died. “Rap God” revisits a crass joke about the 1999 Columbine school shooting initially censored on the first LP’s “I’m Back”. Old nemeses like Insane Clown Posse, Everlast, and the Backstreet Boys are lampooned as well. But <i>MMLP2 </i>revisits more than just the characters and stories of the first installment. It also revels in its predecessor’s worst behaviors, bandying about misogyny and gay slurs as if Eminem’s conciliatory 2001 Grammys performance with a pink polka dot suited Elton John never happened.</p>
<p>“Rap God” is a gobstopping display of Eminem’s champion technical prowess that’s waylaid in every verse by brazen homophobia. “Love Game”, the hotly anticipated team up with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, is similarly assailed by lunkheaded chauvinism, both in Eminem’s gross rendition of a woman giving him oral sex and Kendrick’s barbs about a guy who “drowned like an abortion” and a clingy ex for whom “chlamydia couldn’t even get rid of her.” Elsewhere <i>two songs </i>are dedicated to crucifying the mother of his children and anyone else foolhardy enough to get involved with him. (“Bitch, you complain when you listen to this/ But you throw yourself at me/ That’s what I call pitching a bitch.”) Earlier in his career, Eminem delivered similarly gutbucket content with the shock of incredulity that anyone would find it offensive. It was an error of youthful carelessness. But in 2013, in the wake of the message of redemption he feverishly pitched us just an album ago, Eminem’s return to ruffling feathers carries the stink of desperation. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p>The only salvation for a lot of these songs is Eminem’s alchemical control of rhyme and diction, but even that can be a liability. Thirteen years after the original <i>Marshall Mathers LP</i>, the grating cadence-over-substance ethos of “The Way I Am”, once a stilted outlier on an album packed with otherwise limber wordplay, has now become the rule. “Legacy” pulls all manner of cockamamie pronunciation gymnastics just so Eminem can end every line with the same rhyming syllables, and the song’s decision to dispense with proper word accents and splay sentences haphazardly across the middle of lines makes for a flow that comes across overwrought and labored even as it plays Frankenstein with conventional word choice and rhyme patterns. Filler words frequently clutter lines just to make the rhymes look more dazzling, and in the process we end up with well-executed but empty lines like “I been driving around your side of this town like nine frickin’ hours and forty five minutes now” from “Bad Guy” and “The day you beat me pigs’ll fly out of my ass in a saucer full of Italian sausages” on “Legacy”. Play half of these songs alongside even the clunkiest <i>Marshall Mathers LP </i>cut, and the god of rap’s powers appear noticeably diminished.</p>
<p><i>MMLP2 </i>does step out from under the shadow of its predecessor in its choice of collaborators. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"" target=""_blank"">Dr. Dre</a> sits this one out, appearing as an executive producer but steering clear of any actual grunt work. In his place we get a spate of productions from Eminem himself (often aided by pop heavyweights like Alex da Kid and Emile) alongside a newly in-demand Rick Rubin. <i>MMLP2</i>’s production mostly hews toward the expected stadium rap sounds, but the Rubin cuts award the album a measure of old school rap-rock flair. Unfortunately what sounded like invention for the 1986 Beastie Boys often plays like butt rock in the hands of 2013 Eminem. “Berzerk” turns Billy Squier’s “The Stroke” into questionable back-to-basics posturing, and “So Far…” grinds Joe Walsh’s winding 1978 epic “Life’s Been Good” and Schoolly D’s “P.S.K. (What Does It Mean?)” into fodder for Eminem’s middle-aged finger-waving. (“Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda, be an expert at computers?”) “Rhyme or Reason” cleverly flips the “What’s your name?/ Who’s your daddy?” refrain from the Zombies’ “Time of the Season” into a tongue-lashing for an absentee father, and “Love Game” makes good use of Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders’ “The Game of Love”, sexist lyrical putrefaction aside, but by and large, Eminem and Rubin are not a match.</p>
<p>Eminem is a titan with wordplay, but <i>MMLP2</i> once again finds him at a loss for how to apply his talents. For three albums in the early aughts he devilishly rewrote the rules of pop music to shoehorn hip-hop into the national spotlight, but here he’s winded, struggling to keep up with modern pop conventions, genuflecting to trap on “Rap God” and EDM on “The Monster”, dragging his biggest competitor Kendrick into one of the worst songs of his young career, and soldering on hooks from singers of varying anonymity wherever applicable to ensure this patchwork monstrosity is too big to fail, all of this under the guise of a return to form, his second in three albums. Eminem’s too talented a rapper with too good a Rolodex for this to flop, but damned if <i>Marshall Mathers LP 2</i> doesn’t give it a go. The lesson here, if there’s one to be gleaned from this 80 minutes of cold, clinical lyrical acrobatics, is that rap sequels are a lot like trying on old prom clothes: chance one if you dare, but the only thing you’re liable to display is how much you’ve let yourself go since your glory days.</p></div>"|18733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18733-eminem-the-marshall-mathers-lp-2/|4.7|Craig Jenkins

In the 10 years since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1039-death-cab-for-cutie"">Death Cab For Cutie</a> released their finest record, the title has taken on an unintended resonance in regards to their career. On one side of their fourth of seven studio albums, there are three modestly performed and admirably successful LPs released on Seattle indie label Barsuk. On the other, three exquisite-sounding and wildly successful LPs released on New York City major...Atlantic. Death Cab’s aesthetic hadn’t really changed all that much, and yet how do you span the distance between the uber-<i>#feelings </i>video for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmsEAWQwHY4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“A Movie Script Ending”</a> and two #1 albums (<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15482-codes-and-keys"">Codes and Keys</a> </i>hit #3), Grammy nominations, platinum sales when they meant something, huge festival slots, and Zooey Deschanel? Look, it’s nigh impossible to extricate Death Cab’s ascendance from <i>The O.C.</i>, so how’s this: from the moment the skyrocket guitars go off in “The New Year”, Death Cab are taking a leap of faith like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8i85ChIAxc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seth Cohen up on that kissing booth</a>, risking embarrassment to tell as many people as possible that they may be dorks, but they’re not going to be anyone’s secret anymore.</p>
<p>Up until 2001's <i>The Photo Album</i>, Death Cab created often excellent songs that did a limited number of things—they didn’t rock (nor did they really try), they didn’t groove, their blood didn’t run particularly hot either, even when Gibbard sang about abusive parents, any number of lost loves, or hatred for his future hometown of Los Angeles. On <i>Transatlanticism,</i> well, not much really changed. But Walla in particular found countless ways to work around it. We all know Summer Roberts’ <a href=""http://oc.wikia.com/wiki/Memorable_Quotes_by_Summer_Roberts"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“it’s like one guitar and a whole lot of complaining”</a> wisecrack helped Death Cab far more than it ever hurt them, but what always bothered me was the idea that they ever sounded like one guy. Death Cab songs are nearly impossible to accurately recreate in a solo performance and if the rinky-dink demos (hear “We Looked Like Giants” and the title track with 8-bit drums!) included in the reissue prove anything, it’s that.</p>
<p>Walla takes advantage of all the band’s moving parts, ensuring each one has its own distinct sonic character and turning <i>Transatlanticism</i> into a downright <i>indulgent</i> listen, a grand buffet of texture and tone. On the whole, the band creates perfectly detailed sonic dioramas—from the piano punctuating the pregnant quietude of “Passenger Seat”, you feel a frozen forest night in the middle of winter. “The New Year” captures explosions off in the distance and the ambivalence of wondering why you can’t relate to them. Within these ornate arrangements, a clever addition sneaks in towards the end and steals the song—the xylophone that rearranges the melody of “Title and Registration”, the combination of handclaps and slashing guitars on “The Sound of Settling”, and especially the percussion, whether those of new drummer Jason McGerr or the mechanistic electronics (beyond its profile boost, the concurrent musical influence of Gibbard’s work in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service"">the Postal Service</a> tends to be overstated).</p>
<p>It reveals much of their work leading up to <i>Transatlanticism </i>as test runs—the simple Death Cab + drum machine format of “Coney Island” or the <i>Stability</i> EP are upgraded to complex, mixed-meter rhythms on “Lightness” and “Death of an Interior Decorator”. On “Bend to Squares”, “Title Track”, “Styrofoam Plates” (and later, “Marching Bands of Manhattan” and “Bixby Canyon Bridge”), Death Cab developed a trick where they’d build and build and build without ever exploding into pure catharsis. The consuming title track unapologetically goes over-the-top, giving you a safe and sound drop on the most sincere, intense FaceTime conversation ever: those glistening guitars and the endless, upward ramp of the drums convey enough infinite sadness as is, and then a church choir comes in to goad the listener: <i>will these two EVER just make out already</i>?</p>
<p>Walla was expanding his scope and ambition, intersecting with Gibbard, who was doing the same as a writer. It didn’t initially seem that way: though this record gained Death Cab many, many new fans, it lost some older ones as well, and<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2232-transatlanticism/""> in our original review of <i>Transatlanticism</i></a>, William Morris echoed their sentiments, taking issue with the increased generality of Gibbard’s lyrics. And there’s truth to that, as <i>Transatlanticism</i> is full of compact ways to express the same ideas that Death Cab songs would earlier obfuscate with bigger words or dense metaphor: “So this is the new year/ and I don’t feel any different,” “I need you so much closer,” and of course, “She is beautiful, but she don’t mean a thing to me.” That said, I think you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone else capable of pulling off Gibbard’s more typically elliptical concepts. A disastrous wedding “felt just like falling in love again” to the lonely empty nester on “Death of an Interior Decorator”. “Title and Registration” begins with a silly joke and it’s revealed as a defense mechanism as Gibbard recalls how the dumbest thing (like, “searching for some legal documents”) can unearth a wellspring of repressed feelings. It’s a phenomenon that can cause you to lose hours at a time, and “Title” sums it up perfectly in four minutes.</p>
<p>As a result of pulling all those heartstrings, short of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1043-the-decemberists"">the Decemberists</a>, no band has become an easier target for people who want to assert their “<i>I ain’t with that indie bullshit</i>” masculinity. Granted, Death Cab For Cutie’s music never <i>sounds</i> sexual, and you can’t really call it “rock music” as something derived from “rhythm and blues”—hell, they’ve always been an awkward fit into “emo” as a musical ideal, since that entails some basis in punk and Death Cab clearly have nothing of the sort. And that’s fine, as Gibbard sought to create the definitive songs about the span of a romantic coupling rather than a sonic approximation of it. Whereas the previous albums dealt with mundane, household affairs—reading the unemployment pages, sharing cigarettes, “We Laugh Indoors”—a lot more’s at stake this time out, emotionally and physically. Death Cab thrashes desperately throughout “We Looked Like Giants” while Gibbard recalls both the thrall of hormonal, visceral lust and the painful recollection of the liminal moments spent around jukeboxes and magazines. Wavering sonar beeps cloak low-key amorousness on “Lightness”. And, oh man…""Tiny Vessels.”</p>
<p>A common criticism of Death Cab (and really, its fanbase) is that wimpiness served as a cover for passive-aggressiveness or a safe haven from actually <i>acting</i> on emotions or impulses and risking rejection—if not outright misogyny. “Tiny Vessels” doesn’t exactly negate that criticism, it just forces the issue by putting it right out there. Though he'd reconfigure the “I spent two weeks in Silver Lake” line after his divorce from Zooey Deschanel, that's an exception, as one of Gibbard’s strengths is that his lyrics can be rich with personalized detail without sounding<i> personal</i>. That said, his vocals always lead you to believe that the narrator at least kinda looks like him and it's startling to hear Gibbard detail the kind of callous sexual conquest people think they're escaping by getting into the indie crowd.</p>
<p>The entire band is in peak form on ""Tiny Vessels""—a glancing, sour note in the introductory guitar harmony precedes the unsympathetic admission that you're no different than the narrator, that ""you'll tell her that you love her but you don't."" Time-elapse layering of shockingly distorted guitars raise the drama during the bridge as he “wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking/ As we moved together in the dark.” That gets most of the attention, though it’s the spellbinding third verse where all of it clears out, leaving plangent, echoing drums that house the monstrous, hollowed-out sentiment of Gibbard’s lyric—that of a total jerk who’s very aware of the thoughts and feelings of the other person, but chooses not to stop himself. It’s understandable that many people either can’t or choose not to acknowledge both sides of “Tiny Vessels”, and every time a Death Cab live crowd turns it to a singalong (and it’s usually one of the loudest), it becomes one of the most biting indictment of <a href=""http://jezebel.com/5838994/a-field-guide-to-nice-guys"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“nice guy syndrome”</a> ever written.</p>
<p>We’ve gotten this far, so let’s just do away with it: judging Death Cab, and <i>Transatlanticism</i> in particular, from a completely objective standpoint feels kinda insincere and wholly inaccurate (and everybody knows it). From a lot of the descriptors above, “indulgent,” “consuming,” etc.—you can assume that, yeah, I was completely obsessed with <i>Transatlanticism</i> back in 2003. It was in a way that should be embarrassing in retrospect, but why judge your younger self like that? If the “little brother/sister music” tag often applied to Death Cab is going to stick, at least remember the times when your world was <i>that</i> small where new love (or a broken heart) filled its entirety and thensome. Or maybe that a new love shrinks your world to the point where there isn’t room for anything else. Note the central simile in “We Looked Like Giants”, two people “in the back of [a] gray subcompact/ fumbling to make contact” don’t have a lot of space to consider politics, socioeconomic struggle, whatever you consider to be “important” matters for art to discern.</p>
<p>I mean, I can bust out a map and point out the mountain passes of Virginia’s I-64 that I’d brave after skipping early classes or talk about the resonance of “Title and Registration” in relation to the November day in 2003 I spent getting my automotive legal documents in order or how I first heard the title track on the way to a college reunion, for crying out loud. Serendipity, for sure—but few records open themselves up to forge those kind of moments, to be a formative emotional <i>and</i> listening experience, pushing you to feel what you’re thinking (to flip a line from “Lightness”), daring to be universal enough to allow you to see yourself in it. If you love this album, or <i>will</i>, you’ll have some a personal history of your own and that’s why <i>Transatlanticism</i> stands out over Death Cab’s impressive catalog—they were always great at telling you stories, but here, they proved even better at helping you understand your own.</p></div>"|18656.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18656-death-cab-for-cutie-transatlanticism/|8.4|Ian Cohen

But for music fans who came of age in the pre-internet era, the site has served a more practical, psychologically mollifying function: It’s helped verify the occurrence of events that, for decades, we thought we had simply hallucinated.</p>
<p>For instance, thanks to YouTube, one can confirm that: a) Joan Rivers did indeed have a late-night talk show in the 80s; b) Suzanne Somers was its occasional fill-in host; and c) one night in 1987, U.K. post-punk godheads <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrpVS7m3tX0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wire were her musical guests</a>. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">They didn’t even perform their accessible dance-rock crossover single of the time, “Ahead”, but the impenetrable, pummelling </span><i>The </i><i>Ideal Copy</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> bonus track “Drill.” And instead of just offering up a simple post-performance wave and handshake, Somers actually tried to engage the notoriously stoic group in egreiously idle chit-chat as if she were still hanging at the Regal Beagle. The clip stands as a time capsule of alternative rock’s painfully awkward early encounters with the mainstream, and even today, when indie bands can seemingly go from Bandcamp to </span><i>Letterman</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> in a mouse-click, it’s hard to imagine such a deviously dissonant anti-pop gesture being allowed to play out anywhere near a network-television soundstage. But if there is to ever be another underground-spawned art-punk band to find itself enduring awkward small talk with a television host, my money is on Brooklyn’s </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30205-yvette/"" target=""_blank"">Yvette</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">.</span></p>
<p>Yvette are a two-piece band, but sound like an army—both in their blitzkrieged aggression and the militaristically disciplined manner in which they deploy it. They’re an industrial act in the truest sense of the term, transforming scabrous raw materials into beautiful, glistening, chrome-plated objects that cast an uncanny allure. Theirs is a noise molded into the contours—if not the sound—of pop music, offering an accessible entry point into a world of ugly brutalism. But if Yvette approach their music with assembly-line precison and expediency, their output is hardly identi-kit. <i>Process</i>, their full-length debut, may list 11 tracks on its artwork, however, those markers seem almost arbitrary; rather, the album feels like a series of fragmented outbursts compacted together into a 33-minute piece that frequently shifts course and reanimates into new shapes without warning, often within a span of a single song.</p>
<p>Produced by Godmode Records co-founder/Pitchfork contributor Nick Sylvester, <i>Process</i> proffers a spectacular collision of live, in-the-room clarity (Rick Daniel’s foreboding cymbal taps practically leave cut marks on your skin) and grotesquely manipulated sonics: synths squiggle like screeching guitars; guitars get blown out into bass frequencines; bass lines hum and drone like synths. With harshly rendered sonics and ticking-time-bomb beats swirling around the 360-degree mix, the songs immediately establish a claustrophobic sense of impending doom: The siren-like pulses of “Cuts Me in Half” sound like a contaminated science-lab counting down to self-destruct mode; the otherwise straight-forward post-punk charge of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16199-attrition/"" target=""_blank"">“Attrition”</a> is rendered as a warped, fun-house-mirrored death trip. And Yvette are students not just of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"" target=""_blank"">Wire</a>’s coldly futurist sound and disaffected lyricism, but their sense of pacing, too—even in songs that rarely crack the three-minute mark, there are extended rhythmic builds that suddenly yield to acclereated, white-knuckled climaxes.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most unnerving sound of all on <i>Process</i> is found in Noah Kardos-Fein’s atypically smooth (for a spastic-noise-punk-band) voice, which mostly retains an eerie sense of calm amid the tribal-percussive thumps and mutating discord that threatens to consume him; in the midst of the Liars-like onslaught of “Carbon Copy”, his double-tracked harmonies have the power to freeze the song into a dead stop, only to shatter its structure and liquefy into something new. And given that Kardos-Fein’s mantras-as-manifestos adhere to a melodic logic (if not consistent verse-chorus-verse structures), <i>Process</i> carries with it the possibility of Yvette evolving into something even more ambitious and imposing. The last two pieces, in particular, offer compelling evidence of what this band is capable of when they temper their shifty impluses and see an idea through to its logical conclusion: the instrumental “Absolutes” is the album’s longest song and, not coincidentally its most fully realized, a gonzo air-raid attack of a track that violently unleashes all the pent-up tension the album’s accrued to that point; it clears the way for the ice-age aftermath of “Radiation”, a thundering drums and drones jam that—even the absence of a proper chorus—exudes a cavernous, concert-hall grandeur. At this point, a Leno appearance for Yvette may seem highly unlikely, but don’t count out Fallon.</p></div>"|18711.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18711-yvette-process/|8.1|Stuart Berman
