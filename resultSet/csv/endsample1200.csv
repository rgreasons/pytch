    ill-advised affair with swing music in the mid-1990s.  We can all agree on neo-swing's pointless reanimation--
    it was a style that was so deeply rooted in the period of its inception that fast-forwarding it to the
    post-grunge era and adorning it with tattoos and wallet chains smudged the dapper snap it possessed in
    its heyday.  Plus, the music lacked soul, even in its prime; a whitewashing of the jitterbugging jump blues
    that steamed up many a segregated juke joint, swing just wasn't dangerous music.</p><p>
    
    Ska, even in its revivalism, is a different story.  Ska <i>was</i> soul, channeled from studios in New
    Orleans and Memphis, through transistor radios in the streets of Kingston in the early 60s, and then tilted
    onto the upbeat.  Bands like The Melodians, The Skatalites, and Toots &amp; The Maytals crafted the original
    Jamaican dance music, which of course was mellowed by age and ganja smoke to become reggae.  The ska revival
    bands of late 1970s England added a brash, lefty political element and interracial Wayfarered cool, keeping
    the sound fresh even as it was appropriated.  Some contention, however, arises in the mid-90s when the third
    wave crashed onto MTV, first spiking California pop/punk with a little Two-Tone two-step, then forsaking the
    skank altogether.</p><p>
    
    So, that's the rough timeline of ska's evolution.  Hepcat stands proudly outside it all.</p><p>
    
    With syrupy three-part harmonies and horn-laced swoop, L.A.'s Hepcat hit the scene in the early 90s and
    immediately gained a reputation for their faithful re-heating of old-school Jamaican flavors.  Their
    attention to the originators was immediately apparent in their buttery shoo-wop vocals, jazzy horns, and
    stylish, laid-back posture.  For these guys, the term ""derivative"" was the greatest compliment, and their
    well-studied approach, coalesced during a tour with The Skatalites in '92, yielded some fantastic music
    that would fit comfortably on a '62 Studio One comp.  After two early releases on small labels, the band
    was picked up by Epitaph in '98, released two more albums, and enjoyed limited mainstream success.</p><p>
    
    Epitaph recently reissued Hepcat's hard-to-find '93 debut, <i>Out of Nowhere</i>, on its Hellcat subsidiary,
    a thrilling prospect for fans of the band and the genre.  With its detailed liner notes and photos, this
    reissue is an intimate glimpse into the roots of modern ska's greatest roots band.  While perhaps not as
    memorable as some of the group's later, greater tracks, these songs still show the same soulful, playful
    charge that made the band such a fan favorite.</p><p>
    
    A joyful innocence pervades the record, present in the golden vocal harmonies their bubblegum subject matter.
    The band shows a bit of the reggae, Latin, and Caribbean influence that would be more fleshed out on later
    works like <i>Scientific</i> and <i>Right on Time</i>, but even songs introduced by an exotic dub echo or
    fancy piano trill quickly settle into that skittering, shuffling beat that serves as the happy-footed rhythmic
    foundation of their sound.  A few songs (""The Secret"", ""Nigel"", ""Clarence Thomas"") are presently here in
    early versions that would show up fully realized on successive releases, and within these comparisons
    listeners can gauge the band's progression-- for the most part, Hepcat's arrangements, basslines, and
    overall passion only improved with experience.  Still, <i>Out of Nowhere</i> stands as an early expression
    from a band that managed to remain forever young, looking back to the old days to keep their sound fresh
    when it really mattered.</p></div>"|3823.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3823-out-of-nowhere/|7.1|Jonathan Zwickel

    career that they named their latest full-length <i>The Real Fall LP</i> for clarification.  Given the
    reputation of these numerous shoddy anthologies, however, and the fact that, with the exception of the
    excellent 2002 Rough Trade release, <i>Totally Wired</i>, there has never been any truly ""definitive""
    Fall retrospective, the best a potential convert could hope for was to pick whichever disc bore the
    prettiest packaging.</p><p>
    
    While other Fall comps pride themselves on monochromatic slabs of cover design more
    appropriate for Rothko retrospectives than tumultuous punk albums, <i>50,000 Fall Fans Can't Be Wrong</i>
    instantly has one thing going for it: Its artwork is absolutely hilarious, keenly referencing Elvis Presley's
    billion-selling <i>50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong</i>.  With its image of countless self-replicating
    Elvises hailing down in dashing suits, that original cover was a perfect embodiment of pop music's
    narcissism and weirdness-- incidentally also the two subjects of nearly every song Mark E. Smith ever
    laid to tape.</p><p>
    
    As the first legitimate career-spanning compilation, <i>50,000 Fall Fans</i> begins at the band's inception
    in 1977.  Smith was a mere 20 years old, weaned on garage rock, kraut-rock, and a one-year stint as a dock
    worker.  Like all young adults, he named his band after a Camus novel, quickly releasing a series of singles
    before 1979's full-length debut, <i>Live at the Witch Trials</i>.  Represented by ""Repetition"", the
    pre-<i>Witch Trials</i> band consists of simple angular guitars, teen-pop rhythms, and drunken charm
    without any of the complexity or chaos that would later become integral to their work.</p><p>
    
    Around 1980's <i>Grotesque</i>, The Fall began to seriously investigate other genres, channeling spiraling
    rodeos (""How I Wrote Elastic Man""), steely noise-pop (""Totally Wired""), and rhythmic shrapnel (""New Face in
    Hell"").  <i>50,000 Fall Fans</i> spends its leisurely time in this nascent stage, but the brunt of the album
    is understandably spent exploring The Fall's near-perfect run of albums in the mid-80s, from 1982's <i>Hex
    Enduction Hour</i> to 1986's <i>Bend Sinister</i>.  A staggering 13 tracks from this era find their place
    on this two-disc set, forging a truly brilliant sequence.  Ranging from the blustering, seismic noise of
    ""The Classical"" to the schizophrenic death-rattle of ""The Man Whose Head Expanded"", the album provides a
    convincing case that The Fall were the most uncompromisingly progressive and reliable band of the 1980s,
    whether they assumed the guise of punk heavyweights or sweet electro-divas (with the assistance of Smith's
    wife, Brix).</p><p>
    
    With this sort of lead-in, even the most questionable song of the band's notorious early-90s phase seems
    challenging and substantive.  Considering that this anthology's second disc includes the band's stab at
    Europop/ska-rap (""Why Are People Grudgeful?""), this is truly a feat.  As a general rule, this disc pulls
    one song from every album released from 1990 to the present, distilling each allegedly mediocre release to
    one stunning single.  If anything, however, these selections compel listeners to return to the band's 90s
    output with their tranquilized synths (""Masquerade"") and brash genre-blenders (the Cocteau Twins-vs.-AC/DC
    dynamics of ""The Chiselers"").</p><p>
    
    Of course, with a career that's spanned four decades, <i>50,000 Fall Fans</i> inevitably winds up omitting
    some of the most crucial songs in their canon, including ""Oh! Brother!"", ""Slang King"", ""Bombast"", and
    ""Oleano"".  Still, the songs represented are consistently fascinating and invigorating, many standing as
    among the finest of the last quarter-century, chaotically navigating punk through ever more adventurous
    territory, from Countrypolitan to house music.</p><p>
    
    As a result of this willed diversity and comprehensiveness, <i>50,000 Fall Fans</i> has finally stepped up
    to assume its rightful position as the most successful and essential Fall compilation in existence-- a
    convenient summary for fearful neophytes reluctant to dip their toe into the black hole of the band's
    discography, as well as die-hard fans seeking a distillation of choice cuts from the group's more wayward
    90s efforts.  Smith is never less than inspiring on any of these 39 tracks, flaunting his confrontational
    sneer and leering sarcasm over some of the most erratic, riled riffs in punk.  In his oft-ignored later
    period, Smith sounds even more unhinged, furious and battered, cloaking criticisms of governmental policies
    in lunatic poetics that the most pretentious high-school fanzine dadaists would cower before.  Smith quite
    literally sounds as if his mouth has been pierced full of gaping holes leaking bile and cancer.</p><p>
    
    Incidentally, this is also the fundamental difference between Smith and Elvis.  Elvis was pure sexual dynamite,
    basking in his own libidinal juices; in sharp contrast, Smith is the ugliest, grimiest beast of Lucifer to
    ever drag his expanding head from a pub's water closet.  Elvis may have drooled sex, but it was artificial,
    manipulative, cheap.  The Fall, like all truly great sex, climaxes in rage, regret and release-- the three
    criteria for all utterly essential rock music.  <i>50,000 Fall Fans Can't Be Wrong</i> chronicles more than
    two decades of those climaxes, perhaps to one day be held in similar regard to the album its artwork parodies.</p></div>"|2976.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2976-50000-fall-fans-cant-be-wrong/|9.3|Alex Linhardt

    Germans are constantly yelling and ordering each other around.  Granted, the language's emphasis on
    pronouncing consonants distinctly from one another makes it somewhat less fluid than, say, Italian or
    Portuguese, but in everyday conversation, spoken German usually sounds quite lyrical, with a distinctive
    cadence and bounce.  I have a feeling that our stereotypes of Germany and its inhabitants are basically
    holdovers from the 1940s, when our nations were at war with each other and it was propagandistically
    advantageous to make our enemies appear as raving robot madmen.</p><p>
    It seems there should be more than enough distance between us and World War II to have changed this
    perception by now, but let's face it: Americans by and large don't know shit about things outside their
    borders, and most of them don't care if their perceptions are wrong.  And I suppose people like Blixa
    Bargeld aren't really helping things, either.  Bargeld, as the mastermind behind German industrial
    provocateurs Einstürzende Neubauten, has realized every ounce of the language's potential for confrontational
    harshness over the last 2\xBD decades, though in fairness, he makes English sound just as frightening on the
    rare occasions when he chooses it over his native tongue.</p><p>
    In the band's earliest phases, he never bothered to throw any bones to the English-speaking audiences in
    the world's largest music markets (why should he, really?), just as he never bothered to appease anyone
    who clung to notions like the one that songs should be accessible things, with snappy melodies and friendly
    beats that you could groove to.  The band's early albums are breathtaking clinics in well-sculpted noise;
    abrasive, but not so extreme as to be unlistenable or inaccessible to an adventurous rock audience.  Records
    like <i>Kollaps</i> and <i>Halber Mensch</i> may be uncompromising, but the band's early singles actually
    go them one better in terms of sheer brutal abstraction.</p><p>
    Compiled by Bargeld on the new Mute compilation <i>Kalte Sterne</i>, these 13 tracks, most of which predate
    Neubauten's 1981 debut <i>Kollaps</i>, paint a picture of a band whose goal was to wring as much dread and
    catastrophe out of as limited a sound palette as possible.  Some tracks, like closer ""Durstiges Tier"",
    consist of little more than skeletal gurgles of indeterminate origin, with Bargeld's whispered brain
    scrapings weaving in and out.  Alexander Hacke is credited with ""amplified bowed wire"" on the track, and
    the thin, nasal sound he produces becomes the song's hideous, scoliated backbone.  ""13 Loecher (Leben Ist
    Illegal)"" notoriously uses an electric drill as an instrument-- as literally ""industrial"" as music can
    get.</p><p>
    The first five songs feature the duo of Bargeld and percussionist/power toolist Andrew Chudy as they made
    their first steps into the void in 1980.  Here, Chudy's vaguely tribal drums provide a rhythmic drive for
    Bargeld's guitar string noise, tortured whispers and creepy-as-shit Korg synthesizer drones.  The greatest
    achievement of the band's first incarnation is probably ""Tagesschau-Dub"", a hypnotic, electronically assaulted
    percussion drone (it's hard to make percussion drone, but they manage it) piled high with incongruous samples
    from TV and radio.  It's an astute collage and one of several tracks that betrays the band's initial interest
    in dub production techniques.</p><p>
    As new members climbed on board over the course of 1981, Neubauten largely left that approach behind,
    instead focusing on creating dense, martial barrages of noise full of sounds culled from beating sheets
    of metal, breaking glass and playing guitars as though they were washboards.  Watch out with the headphones--
    there are bursts of piercing white noise (most springing somehow from Bargeld's poor guitar) that can throw
    your equilibrium totally out of whack, not to mention leave a ringing in your ear for hours.  And they have
    other ways to make you squirm: I haven't counted the number of times guest freak Lydia Lunch yells, ""Stick
    it/ Stick it/ Stick it full of holes,"" over the 9-minute course of ""Thirsty Animal"", but it's more than
    enough to make me uncomfortable.</p><p>
    For anyone newcomers looking to acquire a taste for Bargeld's shop of horrors, Neubauten's <i>Halber
    Mensch</i> is a much better port of entry, but on its own merits, <i>Kalte Sterne</i> is a treasure trove
    of prime artifacts from the infancy of an important and groundbreaking band.</p></div>"|2699.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2699-kalte-sterne-early-recordings/|7.7|Joe Tangari

Barry     Kernfeld's article in issue #22 of <i>Stay Free!</i> magazine, ""Pop Song Piracy: Napster in the 1930s and     the Story of Fake Books"", recounts the history of bootlegged song sheets.  The Tin Pan Alley era of     American songwriting (in the early 20th century) was the heyday of sheet music publishing.</p>
<p>According to Kernfeld, bootlegged lyric sheets began to appear in 1929, when the dominance of the recording     industry rendered obsolete the paradigm of having one person in the home who could play the piano read from     35¢ pieces of sheet music for the household's entertainment.  Musical notation became effete because     of the easy access to recorded music, and cheap, bootlegged sheets containing only the lyrics to popular     songs grew more attractive to consumers.  The recording industry reacted to ""songlegging"" exactly how it     reacts to filesharing today: it panicked, and began a series of crackdowns and arrests that did nothing to     stem the tide.  Eventually, music publishers caved to the public desire rather than railing against it,     and began to publish their own sanctioned song-lyric magazines, including the long running <i>Song Hits</i> and <i>Hit Parader</i> magazines.</p>
<p>The article makes the tacit point that music piracy is not just a problem of unregulated technology, but     one that stems from the basic human desire (stoked by an unbridled advertising industry) to imbibe all the     stimulus we think will make us complete while lacking the resources to do so-- that is, while the technology     makes it easier, it isn't the technology's fault.  On their new, supremely organic pop-hop opus <i>Free     Kamal</i>, Radioinactive and Antimc seem to have a more sophisticated understanding of the intricate interface     between technology and human desire than many artists who deal with the topic on either side of the facile     ""technology is awesome""/""technology sucks"" axis.  It approaches the problems of information saturation and     a society increasingly dependent on its machines in a manner that seems less moralistic or paranoid than     honest and realistic, and thus, it becomes like the <i>real world</i>, where oversimplifications break     down-- a record of contradictions and paradoxes.</p>
<p>For instance, <i>Free Kamal</i> advises one to ""befriend a tree, write poetry"" and ""cook from scratch"" (i.e.     to live simply and outside of the mechanisms of modern culture), yet is encoded onto mass-produced discs     and sold over the Internet with an accompanying marketing push.  Radioinactive's rapid, polysyllabic flow     also inveighs against the viral nature of popular culture (on ""Chop Chop"": ""Don't have a PC/ Or MTV/ Or an     HIV/ Or an SUV/ Or an STD/ Or any CD by Master P/ No MasterCard/ No Platinum Plus/ No Palm Pilot/ Gameboy     or Angel Dust"") while being a perfect mirror to its constant, saturated and dazzling influx.  This is not     to criticize Radioinactive for hypocrisy; to the contrary, <i>Free Kamal</i> seems less a self-righteous     critique of its culture than an expression of its conundrums, a living document of its era.</p>
<p>But it's not all technophobic screeds; the record is tempered with minutiae of the mundane and metaphysical     musings on spirituality and ancient wisdom, further broadening its scope to evoke a totality of what it     feels like to be alive today, caught up between so many opposing poles.  Radioinactive's hypnotic, prolix     rhyme style veers through pop singalongs and more traditional highbrow undie rap to weave a vocal tapestry     of exceptionally high thread-count-- it's pop-hop in the vein of Why?'s recent work that never forgets that     it is, at root, hip-hop.  And while its themes are often serious, <i>Free Kamal</i> is giddy and upbeat, a     bright ray of SoCal summer.</p>
<p>A talented multi-instrumentalist with an obvious technical understanding of jazz, rock and pop, Antimc     festoons his drum patterns with live playing that scans across the continuum of modern music.  From the     disco-funk of ""With Light Within"" and ""Movin' Truck"", to the echoing dub of ""First World Justice System"",     to the chanting drum circle of ""The Weight of Secrets"", to the flamenco-guitar inflections of ""Stop Me     Equals Death"", Antimc fluidly unites style after style under his distinctive and unified aegis. <i>Free     Kamal</i> won't make you cut up your ATM card, but it might make you feel better about not being able to     reconcile your desire to do so with the infeasibility of actually doing it.</p></div>"|6665.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6665-free-kamal-with-antimc/|7.7|Brian Howe

I feel the same way about enterprises
    requiring serial numbers.  So you'll understand why I experienced a brief bout of ataxia (a loss of muscle
    control) when I received an unsolicited promo copy of <em>Automatic Writing</em>, clad in a yellow-and-black
    sleeve reminiscent of both crime-scene tape and biohazard packaging.  My name and serial number were
    machine-printed on the CD amid a cluster of unambiguously menacing legal language.  The upshot is that if
    I fileshare Ataxia's music, a digital watermark encoded on the disc will be traced back to me, and Michael
    Powell will personally come to my house and shove jewel cases under my fingernails.  So for the love of God,
    go buy it; don't ask me to burn it for you.  I'm locking it in the safe with my passport and unregistered
    firearm.</p><p>
    Ideas that sound terrible on paper, but work surprisingly well in praxis: Jim Jarmusch's <em>Coffee and
    Cigarettes</em>; Mudhoney's Mark Arm singing for the reunited MC5; mint-flavored lattes; Red Hot Chili
    Peppers guitarist John Frusciante jamming with Fugazi.</p><p>
    You heard me: Ataxia is a collaborative effort between Frusciante, Josh Klinghoffer, and Fugazi bassist Joe
    Lally.  After Frusciante played two experimental electronic shows with Klinghoffer at The Knitting Factory
    in L.A., the two enlisted Lally as bassist for future performances.  But instead of adding Lally to the
    existing music, the trio decided to strike out in a different direction and compose songs together.  Ataxia's
    debut is the product of these extemporaneous sessions, and it represents approximately half of the 90 minutes
    of music Ataxia recorded; the second will be released early next year.</p><p>
<em>Automatic Writing</em>, comprised of five long movements, was recorded with little overdubbing or studio
    chicanery-- just Frusciante on synthesizer, guitar, and vocals; Lally laying down deep waves of cyclical
    bass; Klinghoffer ranging confidently over eclectic but sturdy percussion.  Consequently, the record sounds
    as organic and exploratory as one would expect.  It opens with its most immediately memorable track, the
    nine-minute ""Dust"".  A slow-burning fuse of reiterative bass, supple drums, and the build-and-break ignitions
    of Frusciante's sinuous and serpentine guitar squiggles, it's also the most ""Fugazi-sounding"" song on the
    album, especially with Frusciante's ragged and impassioned vocals groaning over the ample foundation.  It
    would have fit pretty well on <em>Red Medicine</em>.</p><p>
    The trudging ""Another"" reprises the equation from ""Dust"" with new variables-- the bassline reconfigures but
    maintains its lockstep pattern; Frusciante's guitar cuts crisp melodic figures that neatly accrue instead of
    bleeding into one another.  And though its skeletal arrangement, restrained vocal collage and keening
    synthesizer are less instantly engaging than ""Dust"", they nonetheless serve as an effective counterpoint
    to ""Dust""'s aggressive stance.   ""The Sides"" is a stroboscopic echo chamber of percussion, mobile bass, and prickly guitar-- with its discernible
    vocal melody, it's the closest thing to a pop song on <em>Automatic Writing</em>.  The album closes with the
    epics ""Addition"" and ""Montreal"". The former plows through the record's most dense, difficult and abrasive
    sonic territory, while the latter's busy guitar and haunting, enigmatic vocals evoke some of Shudder to
    Think's spookier moments, elongated over 12 daunting minutes.</p><p>
    I wouldn't recommend Ataxia to Red Hot Chili Peppers fans (many of whom probably identify more with Anthony
    Kiedis's ""Mongo, King of the Jungle"" schtick than with Frusciante's chops), but it will come as a happy
    surprise to Fugazi buffs who are dubious about how well this alliance will pan out.  And I hate to say it,
    what with Fugazi's staunchly straight-edge creed, but this is the sort of kaleidoscopic dinosaur-rock that
    the stoner set will just eat up.  You can probably download some MP3s on the networks for a taste, but you
    didn't hear it from me.  It's not going to be my fault when some poor, watermarked bastard gets dragged
    off to Guantanamo Bay.</p></div>"|449.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/449-automatic-writing/|7.1|Brian Howe

    a band signed to Oxford, Mississippi's new-blues label Fat Possum.  The band channel the ghosts of early
    70s-era Lynyrd Skynyrd (two of the four are even brothers), but they're also schooled in 60s Southern pop
    like The Gants and The Hombres.  On their debut, <i>Please Yourself</i>, they never sound quite as vital
    as Drive-By Truckers (or even Lucero); they're not as much fun as The Hives, nor as derivative as Jet;
    and they don't overplay their hand like Kings of Leon (although they have similarly time-capsule haircuts).
    What Thee Shams <i>do</i> is effectively bridge the gap between the recent garage-rock revival and the even
    more recent Southern rock revival, revealing how interlocked the two genres are.</p><p>
    On the other hand, Thee Shams don't bring much new to either revival besides the juxtaposition of the two.
    Instead of reviving or revising a dated style in a new setting, Thee Shams are content to build new songs
    that sound just like old songs.  In other words, they're living in the past and don't think much of the
    present.</p><p>
    But unlike, say, Beachwood Sparks, Thee Shams display a little more scope and ambitious diversity in their
    musical mimicry.  On ""Want You So Bad"", they sound like the house band at some Jackson biker bar circa 1966.
    They trudge through dark swamps on ""She's Been Around"" and coast along a mean highway on ""Come Down Again"".

    and Ronnie van Zant, and Andrew quotes a grindhouse organ riff from quasi-namesakes Sam the Sham &amp; The
    Pharaohs on the opener ""On My Mind"".  As a result (and as a whole), <i>Please Yourself</i> sounds diverse,
    agile in its canny approximation of so many styles and persuasive in its assumption that these styles are
    more or less the same, even if they more or less aren't.</p><p>
    Even so, like irresponsible time travelers, they've unintentionally copped a 1960s misogyny, if a gentler
    strain. The album cover features a topless woman posing on a bed, her breasts bare but her face/identity
    awkwardly cropped out. Cover-art nudity is neither new nor illegitimate nor even unwelcome; it's the album
    title that makes it overtly-- even ironically-- pornographic.  The phrase ""Please Yourself"" is an invitation
    to both masturbation and objectification of this literally faceless woman.  It's an indie-rock cocktail
    napkin.</p><p>
    Of course, album covers are one thing, lyrics another.  On ""Love Me All the Time"", Zachary Gabbard blatantly
    infantilizes the object of his affection: ""You say you need it/ But you don't need anything/ You're just a
    child.""  It's not a darkly sexual come-on like those of fellow Cincinnati Greg Dulli, but a strange and
    creepy demeanor that pervades most of <i>Please Yourself</i>.</p><p>
    This condescension is never mean-spirited or self-righteous, just goofily unself-aware.  Nevertheless, the
    women on <i>Please Yourself</i> all play degraded muses, just as faceless as the cover model: they're
    present only to provide the inspiration for the songs, which are more about the band's nostalgic obsession
    than anything else.  Taking no emotional risks whatsoever, <i>Please Yourself</i> is at worst a cold exercise
    in problematic nostalgia and at best a promising band's naïve debut.</p></div>"|8263.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8263-please-yourself/|6.3|Stephen M. Deusner

I've avoided picking it up mostly because I like the idea of it still being     nestled away somewhere, forgotten by everyone.  Devendra Banhart's title <i>Golden Apples of the Sun</i> neatly references the final line from W.B. Yeats' ""The Song of Wandering Angus"", where it's paired with     those silver moon apples.  (""And pluck till time and times are done/ The silver apples of the moon/ The     golden apples of the sun."")  It's also an album by Judy Collins, a collection of stories by Ray Bradbury,     and a low-budget 1971 film about violence and hippies.  But perhaps Banhart chose the title to contrast     directly with Subotnick's famously chilly modulations, because even while this compilation functions as a     kind of now-sound capsule of the contemporary neo-folk scene, its best artists share an anachronistic,     misfiled air with Subotnick's dusty gem, patiently awaiting discovery.</p>
<p>Whatever the title's derivation, as head curator, Banhart assumes the tricky role of scene definer.  I     can't imagine the man behind ""This Beard Is for Siobhan"" subscribing to locked-door scenesterism, but     <i>Golden Apples of the Sun</i> draws a clean line in the sand.  Unlike Brian Eno, who kept his <i>No New     York</i> sampler to just four acts, the bearded bard here musters a generous spread of 20 diverse freakfolk     acts to serve as representatives of the various facets of the underground's most recent (and most promising)     pigeonhole.  Not intended to flood the market, <i>Golden Apples of the Sun</i> is limited to 1,000 copies     and can only be had through <i>Arthur</i> magazine, which released the disc on its newly founded Bastet     imprint.</p>
<p>For this disc, Banhart wisely pairs spankin' new tracks with a number of previously released ones.  In     an interesting change of pace from most compilations, however, the non-exclusive cuts are the real draw     here, and they greatly benefit from both Banhart's careful sequencing and separation from their original     full-lengths.  Saddled between two downcast instrumentals, Little Wings' ""Look at What the Light Did Now""     absolutely sparkles.  Kyle Field owns a preternaturally heartbreaking (and charmingly off-key) voice even     at his happiest, and here, outside the context of his spotty K Records albums, his syllables are remarkably     affecting.  Viking Moses also kicks it Little Wings-style; his ""Crosses"" (from the album of the same name)     displays a pawnshop sweetness: ""Without love, life is gone/ Without life, love goes on and on.""</p>
<p><i>Golden Apples</i>' shifts in gradation keeps the narrative from stalling-out: Espers' ""Byss &amp; Abyss""     balances boy/girl contrast with just the right amount of Philly opiate haziness; six-stringer Jack Rose     ups the finger-picking ante with the careening notes of ""White Mule"" from his <i>Red Horse, White Mule</i>;     Iron &amp; Wine beautifully represent for soft strums with ""Fever Dream"" from their hugely popular <i>Our     Endless Numbered Days</i>; and Banhart himself shows up dueting with folk legend Vashti Bunyan on the     title track of his recent masterstroke, <i>Rejoicing in the Hands</i>.</p>
<p>Anti-folk singer/songwriter and nutritionist Diane Cluck's ""Heat from Every Corner"" (from <i>Macy's Day Bird</i>)     comes complete with ambient footsteps and a click of the off switch, and sounds as though it was placed on     tape by Chan Marshall 40 years ago.  Current 93 collaborator and one of NYC's most compelling voices, Antony,     closes out the disc in style with a musical interpretation of Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Lake"", featuring his     signature heart-rending, androgynous operatics and mesmerizing piano.  (If you're unfamiliar with his work,     check out the <i>I Fell in Love with a Dead Boy</i> EP and be blown away by the brilliant camp heartache.)</p>
<p>Displacement breathes life into Currituck Co.'s ""The Tropics of Cancer"", a smiling but subdued acoustic     instrumental from the often enjoyable <i>Ghost Man on First</i>, while Vetiver turn in ""Angel's Share"",     a collaboration with Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval that marked the standout on their self-titled debut.     White Magic's ""Don't Need"" isn't the most riveting track from the Brooklyn trio's Drag City debut, but     this meandering twanger makes more sense in the compilation's context than any of <i>Through the Sun     Door</i>'s witchier tracks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inherently strong numbers continue to shine: Joanna Newsom's ""Bridges and Balloons"" feels just     as triumphant torn from <i>The Milk-Eyed Mender</i>.  It functions as a lead-in for Six Organs of Admittance's     ""Hazy SF"", a wee ditty that swims in the suave-dude realm of <i>Compathia</i> rather than the gorgeous     spaciousness of the recently reissued gem <i>For Octavio Paz</i>.</p>
<p>The real treats, however, come courtesy of two lesser-known acts.  Chicago's Josephine Foster (of Born     Heller and The Children's Hour) rustles backwoods memories amid banjo, flute, and the indescribable air of     English romanticism on the unreleased home recording ""Little Life"".  It's a stunning fragment: Shirley     Collins collides with and bows gently within the cleansing mud of a rocky stream.  Likewise, ex-Matty &amp;     Mossy vocalist Jana Hunter blows the roof off the barn with ""Farm, CA"", a section of hauntingly whispered     lo-fi dreaminess.</p>
<p>Not everything here achieves the understated power of these aforementioned tracks, but <i>Golden Apples of     the Sun</i>'s sprawling landscape presents a persuasive case for the depth of a scene that seemingly     sprung up (like mushrooms) overnight.  It's impossible to pick apart intentions, but this music feels far     more sincere than other recent buzzes, and even if these artists <i>are</i> pulling the wool over our eyes     (which seems unlikely), it would appear that perhaps a few of these players will outlast the current     critical harvesting.  To see if I'm right, hide this disc in your bedroom after one listen and wait a     decade before that second date.</p></div>"|549.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/549-golden-apples-of-the-sun-compilation/|8.6|Brandon Stosuy

Residing as he does near the Arctic Circle in Norway, Jenssen
    understands the psychological implications of a sun that, like a lamented deadbeat parent, routinely
    disappears for months at a time, and the absence of that essential lifeforce takes an inevitable emotional
    toll that informs Jenssen's art.  It's tempting to say that Biosphere's bleak music sounds as it does for
    the same reason countries of Norway's approximate latitude make the world's best Vodka.  But then Jenssen's
    other great passion is mountaineering (he has climbed the 26,906 foot Himalayan peak Cho Oyu without oxygen),
    suggesting a kernel of inspired humanity frozen in the tundra.</p><p>
    The vacuum of space gets pretty close to absolute zero, cold's recognized ideal, so it makes sense that the
    conceptually minded Jenssen sets albums there.  His latest trip into the beyond started when French radio
    commissioned Jenssen to create a piece using their archives.  He selected sounds from a radio dramatization
    of Jules Verne's space travel story <i>De la Terre à la Lune</i> (""From the Earth to the Moon"") and pulled
    additional material from recordings made at the MIR space station, then combined the fragments with his own
    new music.  The result is <i>Autour de la Lune</i>, a single 74-minute piece in nine movements.</p><p>
    The samples are used sparingly throughout <i>Autour de la Lune</i>, and the beat-driven side of Biosphere is
    completely absent.  Mostly, the record is a showcase for long and impossibly deep drones.  The 21-minute
    opener ""Translation"" is an exception here, as a cluster of midrange notes that braid to form a definite
    melody.  Rather than referencing found sound or environmental recordings, ""Translation"" seems inspired by
    film music, with tense throbs and horn-like synth lines that suggest captured images of a spacecraft leisurely
    moving in front of stars.  The scene is set.</p><p>
    The following ""Rotation"" does away with the fanfare to send faint pings and bass swells into the blackness,
    but the exceptional ""Modifié"" is where the record starts to get creepy.  Jenssen processes human voices--
    hard to tell if they're from the radio broadcast or MIR cosmonauts-- in a way that merges them completely
    with the electrical noise that carries them.  They sound lost and unreachable, the last little whimpers of
    a doomed crew about to be swallowed by the event horizon.  And yet, they're singing, kind of.</p><p>
    We follow them into darkness with the next few tracks, which consist of little more than the most punishing
    bass tones I've ever heard on a CD.  On ""Déviation"", sounds hover at the bottom end of human audibility,
    causing all but the heartiest subwoofers to sound like an open newspaper flapping in a strong wind.  I've
    approached this bass from three different sources (two sets of headphones and my living room speakers),
    and I can only guess the genuine sound through triangulation.</p><p>
    Strange things happen when I listen to ""Circulaire"" loud on headphones; the low end is total and all
    encompassing, but with the kind of throb that happens when you can hear your heart beating in your ears.
    The contrast means that the ambient sounds wherever I happen to be create ""notes"" in between the pulses.
    Because it seems so grounded in biology, I can't help but imagine this middle section as a musical
    approximation of the ambience in a suit during a spacewalk, where you hear nothing but your own body.
    If that's so, ""Tombant"" is accompaniment to the final drift back into the docking hatch, as it reprises
    the textures and symphonic swell of the opening ""Translation"".</p><p>
<i>Autour de la Lune</i> is an excellent record that is nearly victimized by its awesome conceptual success.
    It offers such a compelling and internally complete idea of interstellar space-- moods, textures, samples,
    cover art, all of it-- that it loses some flexibility when it comes to individual interpretation.  Still,
    Jenssen gotten exactly where he wanted to go.  Upon reaching the icy mountain peak, he kept climbing into
    the stars.</p></div>"|710.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/710-autour-de-la-lune/|7.8|Mark Richardson

On her second album leading The Sweet Hereafter, Jesse Sykes tries     valiantly to showcase her crack backing band, favoring phrasing that leaves room for Phil Wandscher's     meticulously crafted guitar peels, or a subtle mood affirmation from violinist Anne Marie Ruljancich.     But the sailors know it's Sykes' alto dashing ships on the rocks, and challenging the alt-country tag     at the same time.  ""Your black eyes remind me/ Of the dreaming dead,"" Sykes sings over some kind of     reworked psych-folk rhythm, and she sounds like a suddenly un-shy Chan Marshall flirting dangerously with     her inner Arthur Lee.</p>
<p>Hailing from the wet winds of Seattle, Jesse and Wandscher-- together with Ruljancich, bassist Bill Herzog,     and consistently understated drummer Kevin Warner-- have been crafting sleepy meditations on American music     and the human condition since 2002's gorgeously strong-jawed <i>Reckless Burning</i>.  Still, it's <i>Oh,     My Girl</i> that will give them their due, since (paging Seth Cohen and Death Cab for Cutie) their new     label, Barsuk, has promotional balls.  Example?  <i>Girl</i> recently broke through to the l'il smokies 'n'     cocktails affluence crowd with a fawning review on NPR's <i>All Things Considered</i>.  Damn right it was     fawning-- with their new record, Sykes and The Sweet Hereafter easily trample the confining fences of     y'allternative, instead aiming steadily for mystery salons held in the narthexes of brokedown cathedrals.</p>
<p>""He took the fall/ 'Cause some things in life are still worth a good brawl.""  ""Tell the Boys""' hard-hours     morning light shuffle is only a blank page for Sykes' pointed suggestion of a lyric.  The story doesn't     finish-- there's regret, and people getting sober, and the title's resigned request-- but the images shuttle     through Wandscher's guitar leads like otherworldly newsreels.  On ""You Are Not Gotten Here"", Ruljancich's     violin suggests the brittle melancholy of Nick Drake's ""Cello Song"", but there's something purer and darker     in Sykes singing ""there's fire on your tongue,"" backed up by guitars that are either sad drinking partners     or friends enlisted to help bury a body.</p>
<p>As striking and evocative as Jesse Sykes &amp; The Sweet Hereafter can be, many will map their favorite spots.     Yes, <i>Oh, My Girl</i> does continually return carrier pigeon-like to the warm comfort between Sykes'     elongated vowels and Wandscher's inky twang leads.  But isn't this is what we want?  One or two notes of     that prairie fire smoke and we're hooked on Sykes' vocal; her supporting players are proven soul-tweak     pros. We want our Americana to resonate with a mixture of warmth and scratch, of death and love.  And,     like a trusty old radio, <i>Oh, My Girl</i> delivers.  ""Troubled Soul"" and ""Winter Hunter"" are as tart as     Washington apples, alive with feeling but sweetly, sultrily inviting.  This is the album of sad beauty the     Scud Mountain Boys were too suicidal to make; it's what happens when fronting on style is shunned in favor     of inventive songwriting that focuses (perhaps too closely, but whatever) on the unique talents of a lineup.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>Oh, My Girl</i>, it always seems like Sykes and her people are holding back, as if they might     throw the cloak off a thundering acoustic version of Heart's ""Magic Man"" at any moment, and send us all     caterwauling back to a time when genres weren't micro-managed, bras weren't worn, and evocation was a     necessity borne with learning how to sing.  This never quite happens, though the weird psychedelic overtones     that keep welling up do wonders for overactive imaginations wishing to contextualize <i>Girl</i> as an     understated look at the legacy of late-60s/early-70s rock.  They could be Heart if they wanted to, no     question.  But Sykes, the amazing Wandscher, and their talented mates have chosen instead to make something     wholly their own, settled on a shore of rocky emotions, sweeping, concealing dune grass, and caves that lead     to sad echoes and who knows what else.  In those dark places cut into the earth, Sykes' sinewy vocal is like     a canary with a cigarette.</p></div>"|7766.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7766-oh-my-girl-with-the-sweet-hereafter/|7.6|Johnny Loftus

    and Wolfgang Voigt), the notion of ""family spirit"" often comes up.  Since the Cologne-based enterprise
    originated as a record store, many of the artists, producers and other associates not only share aesthetic
    ideals, but close physical proximity.  Aksel ""Superpitcher"" Schaufler started out working in the store
    before releasing his music on the label, and was already close friends with Mayer, Voigt and DJ Tobias
    Thomas; Tobias worked with Jörg ""The Modernist"" Burger on the scene mag <i>House Attack</i> prior to making
    his first production appearance for the Kompakt clan (via the sibling label Profan) on ""Sweet"" Reinhard
    Voigt's <i>M</i> 12-inch in 1996.</p><p>
    Yet, despite Kompakt's incestuous nature, the label has succeeded in avoiding being pigeonholed as merely
    a purveyor of Kraftwerk-born, minimal dance music.  In 2000, their <i>Schaffelseiber</i> compilation promoted
    ""shuffletech"" as a new slant on techno's time-honored 4/4 pulse by shifting the upbeats over a tad to
    produce a lightly swinging groove more related to the blues than the ultra-white Kraftwerk/Giorgio Moroder
    template.  And unlike Paul Van Dyk-style arena-rave extravaganzas, Kompakt artists are more likely to bathe
    in puffed bliss than pump out PLUR-oughfare for space cadets.  Artists like Kaito, Markus Guentner and The
    Orb have more in common with Brian Eno than The Bee Gees: Clear, uncluttered productions and an ambient,
    electronic sheen provide the spark in their near-colorless (yet intricate) structures and midnight vamps.</p><p>
<i>Kompakt 100</i> celebrates the label's 100th vinyl release (not counting the subsidiary labels) filling
    four LPs (or two CDs) with Kompakt artists remixing Kompakt artists.  This differs from past compilations
    (like the <i>Pop Ambient</i> and <i>Total</i> series) in that none of the original tracks are actually new,
    but taken as a whole, the collection is a convenient summary of the imprint's first six years.  However, it
    doesn't necessarily represent the current state of Kompakt, where artists like Justus Köhncke and Superpitcher
    are pushing its traditionally understated ideals to the brink with comparatively extroverted disco, approaching
    pure, shiny pop via excellent 2004 releases.  Though both of these artists are represented on this
    compilation, I'd like to have heard more of their influence throughout.  <i>Kompakt 100</i> is a decent
    introduction to the label for newcomers, but fans may feel the remixes don't improve or update their
    sources enough to warrant repeated plays.</p><p>
    Though the set isn't programmed to flow together as a continuous mix, the best moments occur when the track
    sequencing cooperates with the songs' momentum.  On the first disc of the CD version, there's a three-song
    stretch featuring The Modernist's remix of Köhncke's ""Weiche Zaune"", Joachim Spieth's pounding mix of Mayer's
    shuffle ""17 &amp; 4"" and the first of two versions of Superpitcher's ""Tomorrow"" that suggests <i>Kompakt 100</i>
    could make a fine party starter.  Coming out of the hard, squelched bassline of ""17 &amp; 4"", Kaito's mix of
    the Superpitcher song glides by with precision and grace, accentuating Schaufler's original vocal with airy
    synths and fashion show chic.  Wassermann (a Mayer alias) almost keeps pace with a smooth, dreamy mix of
    Reinhard Voigt's ""Robson Ponte"" but the CD recedes into cloudy floss prematurely with two melancholy remixes
    by Guentner (Kaito's ""Respect to the Distance"") and label elder statesman Olaf Dettinger (Closer Musik's
    ""One Two Three [No Gravity]"").</p><p>
    The second disc follows a similar pattern, right down to the final two tracks of warm, fuzzy ambience.  The
    obvious highlight is Köhncke's version of the Freiland (aka Wolfgang Voigt) track ""Frei"" mashed with Marc
    Bolan's ""Hot Love"", transforming pleasant shuffletech into glam-rock for androids-- at press time, Köhncke
    is arguably the only person in the world who can sell a line like, ""He ain't no bitch, and I love the way
    he twitch, uh-huh,"" convincingly.  Jurgen Paape's mix of Schaeben &amp; Voss' ""The World Is Crazy"" and their
    own reworking of ""Dicht Dran"" works well as a double shot of aggressive microhouse (also featuring
    micro-melody), while Closer Musik's Matias Aguayo teams with Leandro Fresco to turn Fresco's ""Cera Uno""
    into a burning, bass-heavy tech-samba.  Elsewhere, as on ScSi-9's mix of ""Tomorrow"", inoffensive pleasantries
    threaten to steal wind from the disc's sails, but as with the Kompakt label itself, <i>100</i> generally
    returns whatever interest you care to invest.</p></div>"|2020.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2020-kompakt-100/|7.6|Dominique Leone

    steel guitar.  The recordings were released in a very limited run-- only 55 CDR copies were sold-- on
    Charalambides' own Wholly Other label.  This two-track, 49-minute record is neither as eerie nor as
    elaborate as most of his band's work; rather, it's a test of endurance and restraint as Carter repeats
    and tweaks his simple sonic notions, sometimes letting minutes go by with barely a discernable sound.</p><p>
    
    The two-minute ""Monument 1 (Memorial)"" opens the album so faintly that in order to hear any of Carter's
    light rumblings, I had to pump the volume up to 11, creating so much hiss and distortion that it was nearly
    impossible to tell where the limitations of my speakers left off and Carter's guitar-tweaking dropped in.
    However, that subtle guitar scratching is just a warm-up act for what follows.</p><p>
    
    ""Monument 2"" clocks in at 47 minutes, making it as much of an stamina-stretcher to listen to in one sitting
    as it surely was for Carter to record.  The piece opens quietly, shimmering and wriggling out of Carter's
    fingertips as he lightly plucks a few notes. These sounds build on themselves, seeming to stay within a
    range of just a few notes as Carter varies the duration and volume of each pulse, focusing more on his
    brushstrokes and textures than on changing colors.  He gradually incorporates more sounds and effects:
    the low, swooping moans at 12 minutes, the almost frantic shrillness at 16 minutes, and the climaxing
    flirtation between the two a few minutes later.</p><p>
    
    This is where many would call it quits.  Instead, Carter continues, backtracking almost to the beginning as
    his guitar's ringing tonalities slowly pulse and echo and fade away only to be picked up by the next slightly
    expanded repetition and carried just a little further, like waves slowly covering more ground as the tide
    comes back in.  This continues for a rambling 10 minutes, until Carter finally pushes the volume up a notch
    for a momentary crest, then quickly sinks back down again.  The tide gradually begins to ebb away with one
    last wail at 40:00 that pulses and resonates for several minutes as a few undercurrents fight their way to
    the surface, finally reaching some sort of harmony as the song shimmers into the distance as quietly as it
    began.  It's these final few minutes that do seem interminable; the focus and drive of the piece's first
    half is gone and, like hitting the wall at a marathon's 22nd mile, all you want is for it all to end.</p><p>
    
    Although there are certainly moments where Carter pauses long enough to imply a new thought-- or to call
    to question his continued focus-- this is just one track, one on which he somehow ends roughly where he
    had begun almost an hour earlier.  Carter glares at a few simple sounds, stretching and pulling at them
    to conjure flickering images, transcending his self-imposed constraints through hallucination.  This solo
    outing certainly won't have a widespread appeal (even among Charalambides fans) but Carter's restraint is,
    if nothing else, a marvel.  For those willing to attempt to wade through <i>Monument</i>, it's a journey
    preferably taken with headphones on a dark night, with someone to pull you out if you slip too deeply

    released internationally in late 2001, ecstatic scribes across the globe simultaneously tensed and paused,
    curling over their cheap notebooks, chewing on ballpoint pens, and trying, desperately and collectively,
    to conjure the perfect glacial metaphor, to birth a descriptor appropriately gnarled and vast, to ink the
    impeccable (and inevitable) line from Iceland's craggy landscapes to Sigur Rós' dark, desolate compositions.</p><p>
    Since then, Iceland's sprawling horizon has become an oddly ubiquitous touchstone for describing
    contemporary American music, with loads of new bands snatching their spectral bits from Sigur Rós' massive
    arsenal of otherworldliness.  Tristeza's Jimmy LaValle, who has been recording spare, instrumental hymnals
    as The Album Leaf since late 1998, is the closest North American equivalent to the pale Nordic maestro, and
    his pockets are well-stuffed with the papers to prove it: After touring extensively with Sigur Rós (who
    frequently joined LaValle onstage), LaValle was shuttled-via-invite to Mosfellsbaer, Iceland to record at
    Sundlaugin, Sigur Rós' home studio, borrowing their string section, Amina, and collaborating with vocalist
    Jon Thor Birgisson and members of (fellow Icelandic howlers) Múm.</p><p>
    The resulting record, The Album Leaf's third, is a collection of wispy rock songs peppered with sputtering
    beats, vocals, Moog, and gently whining strings.  Curiously, LaValle's portrait of Iceland presents a far
    cooler vision than his guides' ever have: <i>In a Safe Place</i> is occasionally chilling, a studied,
    calming slice of icy serenity.  With tinkling Rhodes piano, glockenspiel, and subtly propulsive percussion,
    <i>In a Safe Place</i> is the sound of slowing down; the record feels tired-but-satisfied, like crawling
    home after a long night of misadventures, burrowing into the backseat of a cab, squinting your eyes at the
    light buzzing across the horizon, tying your shoes, and thinking hard about blankets.  LaValle has always
    masterfully straddled the thin, gray stretch between Saturday night debauch and Sunday morning remorse,
    and <i>In a Safe Place</i> exists almost exclusively in the moments where nothing feels quite real, the
    place LaValle calls ""safe.""</p><p>
    The Album Leaf is a solo effort, but LaValle is famously collaborative (he's also been tangled up with The
    Locust and GoGoGo Airheart), and, in addition to Birgisson, The Black Heart Procession's Pall Jenkins is
    often present to coo along to LaValle's gleaming cuts.  Still, it's LaValle's own vocal contributions--
    his first time singing with The Album Leaf-- that hit first and hardest. ""On Your Way"" sees LaValle chanting
    carefully along with Jenkins, singing high and flat over a pinging bit of melodic space-pop; their respective
    imperfections shine like bits of red mitten stuck to a frozen window, awkward and stupidly beautiful.
    Birgisson's contribution-- the impeccably weird ""Over the Pond""-- is sung in his trademark Hopelandic,
    and features backing samples of his own vocals, whirled into cartoon hysterics.  ""Over the Pond"" is
    insistently haunting, a meditative, piano-heavy examination of intangibles, as satisfying as it is vague.</p><p>
    Detractors will be sure to note that <i>In a Safe Place</i> can feel numbingly repetitive at moments, but
    all that expansive diddling contributes equally to the record's allure: Like rolling past the North Pole
    or through West Texas, this record plays with its own redundancies, building an entire universe from strange,
    barren pieces.  In the end, it all spins into nothing.</p></div>"|101.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/101-in-a-safe-place/|7.9|Amanda Petrusich

    ""Tangled Up in Blue"", for instance, is a tale of fading love, but the power and significance of the song
    itself is timeless.  Rock 'n' roll is often an expression of youth or youth's passing, but when music (or
    any art) endures, its magnetism is only amplified with the passage of years.  For that reason, and because
    the best songs are usually pinned by the listener to some quintessential moment, the classics become classic.
    Passion is a fleeting feeling, but the best art will evoke that feeling with every exposure.</p><p>
    So when youth produces a work of such force, when the raw or supposedly naïve artist comes up with something
    universal, critics and fans rejoice.  We want to latch on to a beautiful thing before its green genius withers
    under the glare of success.  Such is the case with Two Gallants' debut <i>The Throes</i>.  The San Francisco
    duo responsible for this gut-wrenching musical tragedy both just turned 21, yet somehow their musical hindsight
    extends far beyond recent memory and taps into a rusty vein swollen with grief, heartache and violent
    desperation.</p><p>
    When songwriting this evocative is paired with playing so dynamic, especially in an acoustic setting, Dylan
    comparisons are inevitable.  Given Two Gallants' guitar and drums lineup and rustic blues-based repertoire,
    many might cry White Stripes as well.  There are better analogies, though: More narrative than abstract,
    Adam Stephenson's lyrics are closer to Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter's romantic Old West allegories,
    luckless sagas of trains and booze and double-crossing lovers.  Meanwhile, Tyson Vogel's shifting thoroughbred
    pulse on drums is less Meg White then Patrick Carney of The Black Keys.  That The Black Keys' and Two Gallants'
    debut releases were both released on Alive Records is no coincidence; both embrace a hardened revivalist style
    that owes a lot to the dark Delta legends.  But the mug-swinging sea shanty bluster and jailbreak urgency
    Two Gallants add to indie rock's newfound blues idolatry are purely original, and make <i>The Throes</i>
    an electric, unforgettable listen.</p><p>
    There's a modernizing of old styles here-- the album begins with a frantic garage-rock rearrangement of the
    1930s Reverend Robert Wilkins track ""You Losing Out"".  The gutsy ""Nothing to You"" opens like an angry country
    blues rant but tosses in some clever quips: ""My kind's been around forever/ Yet I claim to be one of the few/
    And the lost cause of words walks away with my nerves/ 'Cause I'm gay as a choir boy for you,"" and then later,
    ""I followed you into the party/ That no one invited me to/ But I got so drunk and retarded/ I fell down the
    stairs and I fell into you.""</p><p>
    Forgoing conventional verse/chorus/verse structure, these songs build a creaking work song practicality and
    archetypal power.  ""Fail Hard to Regain"" contains almost no repetition, but Stephenson's reedy voice tears
    into the subconscious and lodges mercilessly like a tick. It's the albums most raucous, ballsy composition,
    Stephenson's harmonica and guitar perfectly punctuated by Vogel's storming percussion, and yet with speaks
    in stanzas reminiscent of a whiskey-soaked Dylan Thomas poem: ""'Twas on a dark March evening, southbound I
    did ride/ My head was out the window when I found her at my side/ Asked where I was going to, I told her
    from where I came/ For the jails in which I've done my time, I fail hard to regain.""</p><p>
    That soulful Pogues-style urbanizing of down-home bumpkinism, combined with an unbridled, youthful vigor,
    balances the album's startlingly troubling themes.  ""The Throes"" tells intimately of a vicious, abusive
    relationship; accompanied by cello, ""Crow Jane"" is a haunting version of a traditional murder ballad covered
    by the likes of Skip James and Nick Cave.  Like a course in musicology these songs bring out an incredible
    richness of history, telling stories based on the half-truths and legends that bring the ghosts of long
    dead musicians and musical styles into new light.</p><p>
    James Joyce was in his early 20s when he finished the short story of shiftless, dissolute youth that Two
    Gallants take their name from.  <i>Dubliners</i>, the collection in which the story appeared in 1905, would
    later be hailed a literary masterpiece.  Suffering only in its somewhat understated production, <i>The Throes</i>
    could be considered a masterpiece of new American roots music.  It's a heavy emotional investment, a struggle
    of the most fulfilling kind.  There's a lot to learn from these young bards, as much as they've learned in
    their short lives.  When brilliance arrives so early it's always that much more profound.</p></div>"|8261.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8261-the-throes/|8.5|Jonathan Zwickel

It's spawned thousands of science fiction novels and films, countless stoned teenage conversations, and at least one awesome TV show starring Jerry O'Connell. The idea, of course, is that at any point in time, all available choices and possibilities are realized in an ever-blooming flower of multiverses. I mention it because, occasionally, I get the feeling that an album I'm listening to has arrived from one of these parallel existences-- that the artist has, at some point, departed from his or her peers to create music inspired by the same sources, but achieved through a parallel axis of logic. Unfortunately, these albums that fail to appeal to some sense of familiarity and categorization are easily overlooked, and only occasionally rescued from history's cruel used bin.</p>
<p>Susumu Yokota makes albums that increasingly worry the boundaries of IDM, ambient and sound collage. Yokota has come at abstract music from the origin of being a house DJ in his native Japan, meaning that his sensibilities are not always aligned with those who balk at the cheesy tropes of techno (warm synth tones playing major seventh chords, heavily reverbed female vocal samples, etc), yet too unconventional and complex for the trance crowd. <i>Laputa</i> is Yokota's most abstract and foreboding-sounding release yet. Almost entirely beatless, its pieces float quietly in and out of existence, operating according to their own logic and leaving the same faint, surreal impressions as dreams upon waking.</p>
<p>Initially, <i>Laputa</i> strikes as a sample-based version of Eno's <i>Shutov Assembly</i> or Aphex Twin's <i>Ambient II</i>. But this is not ambient music-- not in the sense that ambient is designed to integrate with its environment, that the musical events in an ambient piece occur randomly within defined parameters, nor in the club-oriented sense of the term. Playing this CD while you attempt to engage with the world around you will likely induce a state of unease, monotony, and (as I discovered) creep out any visitors who decide to stop by your place. It is an immensely subtle album that rewards attention, but to the half-listening ear is an aimless amalgamation of rhythmically incoherent samples.</p>
<p>As the record's proclamatory title suggests, Yokota attempts to create a world in itself. His aim is not to transform your external environment, but to form one in your head-- if Eno's <i>Another Green World</i> presents a universe not unlike our own, where they still have swimming little fishes and bouncy pop music, <i>Laputa</i> presents an abstract and entirely unfamiliar space.</p>
<p>As much as any electronic artist working today, Yokota is directly indebted to the minimalists of the 70s and 80s, even paying homage in the piece ""Grey Piano"", which takes as its musical cues from Arvo Part's piano work on ""For Alina"". He often employs the musical devices of minimalism, such as interlocking circular melodies and processes of slow transformation, and is especially adept at creating rhythms produced through the interaction of two evolving samples, as evidenced by the interlocking left and right channels of ""Heart by Heart"". Against various droney and spacious backdrops, Yokota presents independently floating and interacting bits of sound that suggest geometric patterns and shapes, such as the woman's voice at the beginning of ""Trip Eden"" that rises and reverses upon itself like a sleek symmetrical object.</p>
<p><i>Laputa</i> does have a couple of lulls: ""True Story"", for example, owes a bit too much to the conventions of pastoral ambient. Which is a shame, because otherwise,<i>Laputa</i> is strikingly original. The album will certainly turn off those seeking instrumental music with direct emotional resonance, as Yokota's impact comes not from his manipulation of feelings, but from his musical transformation of space and time. It may also alienate fans of experimental music who equate complexity with dissonance. <i>Laputa</i> is the sound of Susumu Yokota letting go of any inhibitions regarding his definition as an artist. Hopefully, listeners will allow themselves the same level of freedom, as <i>Laputa</i> is a world that deserves tourists.</p></div>"|8877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8877-laputa/|8.3|Liam Singer

The Chinese Stars are now a ""dude"" Erase Errata.  Much like their West Coast
    counterpart, the Providence band has put together a full-length album with nine attempts at playing the same
    goddamn song.  All the tempos are exactly the same, there's a token noisy guitar riff that introduces every
    track and then sticks with it throughout, and singer Eric Paul consistently rattles off crackpipe lyrics
    about body parts, bugs and machines.  And, save some occasional breaks, there's more fucking swishy hi-hat
    than anyone could possibly tolerate.  Erase Errata's a lost cause, but who told this promising Providence
    band to start parodying themselves, too?</p><p>
    
    It's a shame.  The quartet, constituted of ex-Arab on Radar and Six Finger Satellite members, managed remarkable
    variety on their debut <i>Turbo Mattress</i> EP, and with perplexing second nature-- it was as if The Chinese
    Stars had no idea they had dancepunk tendencies.  The slow-in-muck bursts of guitar noise on ""The Fastest
    Horse Yet"", the hyper-intelligent rhythm switchups on ""Arson Hotline"", and the kamikaze fuck-it-all
    counterbeat on ""Loose Traffic"" all fit into the genre without bowing before its silly self-conscious rule:
    It ain't good if you can't dance to it.  The <i>Turbo Mattress</i> EP did have two fairly straightforward
    dancepunk songs-- ""Sick Machine"" and ""Eyes of the Secret North""-- but given the band's noisy prehistories,
    even these songs came off as relentless, spit-happy monsters that just happened to be danceable.</p><p>
    
    These days, it would seem The Chinese Stars are concerned only with being a one-trick dancepunk band.
    They've streamlined their act to cover just one relatively accessible sound, one friendly tempo, and one
    swishy hi-hat schtick.  This is fine for a track or two on <i>A Rare Sensation</i>, especially considering
    that guitarist Paul Viera's serrated single-plucks and noisy bone-dry heaves on opener ""Cheap City Halo""
    rival his best moments on <i>Turbo Mattress</i>, and Eric Paul's deceptively kind tambourine work loosens
    up the song's potentially too serious tone.  Dance meets punk remarkably midway on ""Girls of Las Vegas"",
    to a large extent because of bassist Rick Pelletier's rubbery dub line that recalls PiL tracks ""Memories""
    and ""Careering"".</p><p>
    
    But elsewhere on <i>A Rare Sensation</i>, tracks follow one another indistinguishably.  An occasional
    this-or-that jumps out of the album's obnoxiously persistent monotony, but in most cases, it's Viera on
    guitar again, clearly the band's hardest working member.  As was the case on <i>Turbo Mattress</i>, Viera
    has complete control over an entire spectrum of noise, from the mousey snickers on ""Dressed to Get Blessed""
    to the speaker specters on ""Electrodes in Captivity"" to the pained whelps in ""Hospital Fly"". Moments like
    these make me wish that The Chinese Stars would realize something about themselves: They can pull off much
    more than this.  Here, the band happened to put all their eggs into that basket, and <i>A Rare Sensation</i>
    sells them frustratingly short.</p></div>"|1726.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1726-a-rare-sensation/|6.1|Nick Sylvester

    wine and cheese, when the phone rings.  It's Manfred Eicher from ECM, head of the world's most famous art
    music label, calling to say that he's kicking off a new series of anthologies.  Not only does he want to
    give you a disc, but he wants you to pick the tunes.  So you go to your record collection and dust off up
    to 30 years of old vinyl, and as you flip through possibly dozens of albums, you have to decide: Who are
    you?  And what do you want to say about yourself?</p><p>
    Like the most well-adjusted guy at the high school reunion, Pat Metheny used his set to rattle off hit after
    hit and reminisce in the liner notes about all the good times he had, before leaving for a bigger label.
    Chick Corea left out his influential experimental work with Circle, while Keith Jarrett packed his set with
    material that he didn't think we paid enough attention to the first time, including a bunch of weird stuff
    with clavichord and recorders.  And at the other end of the ""look at me"" spectrum from Jarrett, Bill Frisell
    included a piece that he didn't even write or perform on.  No matter how strong the collections tend to be,
    no artistic or commercial logic-- no hard curatorial judgment-- guides what ends up on them, and that's both
    revealing and flawed.</p><p>
    German bassist and composer Eberhard Weber has worked with the ECM label almost since its founding.  Weber
    performs on an electric, five-string bass of his own design, which produces a unique, almost rubbery,
    elongated tone, higher than usual for an upright and elastically melodic.  Most of his major work came out
    on ECM, aside from one stint in pop music-- a few appearances with Kate Bush, who used Weber's distinct tone
    most notably on ""Houdini.""  Nowadays, he tours with Jan Garbarek's group and has only cut two albums of his
    own in the last decade, most recently in 2001.</p><p>
    It's not surprising that Weber splits this album almost equally between sideman gigs and his own bands.
    But he doesn't explain why he skipped his only masterpiece-- his debut, <i>The Colours of Chloe</i>.  One
    of ECM's earliest classics, <i>Chloe</i> still sounds unprecedented; the only albums I could compare it to
    are some of the dreamier fusion and prog music of the time from maybe Soft Machine, and its most childlike
    moments might appeal to fans of Boards of Canada.  Weber, keyboardist Rainer Brüninghaus, and fluegelhornist
    Ack van Rooyen front a chorus of cellos, whose long, drowning tones evoke the feel of crumbling walls: From
    a European, it echoes the feeling of an old civilization growing older, of an almost epic weariness that
    threatens to drag down the entire group-- especially on ""An Evening with Vincent Van Ritz"", recently sampled--
    and why don't more people sample ECM?-- by Prefuse 73, where they and the wordless, keening voice of Gisela
    Schäuble tug at Weber's feet.</p><p>
    Yet Weber soars across the solemnity, pulling high notes and elegiac melodies onto the foreground to mark
    the death of one generation with the emergence of another.  On the slow ""More Colours"", Weber's bass yo-yos
    against the heavy silences.  And the title song, still Weber's most famous piece, has a simple, sing-songy
    primary melody that Weber performs on the ocarina, evoking a peeking-over-the-crib revelation like an infant
    realizing for the first time that the sun rises and sets. And while the through-composed elements frame the
    album, the solos by Bruninghaus and (on ""Van Ritz"") van Rooyen are so perfectly formed that I can still
    recall them note for note.</p><p>
<i>Chloe</i> remains Weber's most endearing work, not least because he's so obviously finding his way
    through the album; he recalls, in the liner notes to this collection, that he had to record the title song
    in two stages before he figured out how to make it work.  Maybe he feels that the album was immature or
    too rough around the edges, because he doesn't include a single song from it.</p><p>
    Weber does tap his 70s work twice, with ""Silent Feet"", where Brüninghaus' extended piano solo takes off
    like horses at a shotgun blast, and ""Fluid Rustle"", which is nearly as enigmatic as the <i>Chloe</i> tracks.
    Weber builds the piece from a theme that could've been played by a five-year-old on a xylophone, then gives
    that theme to vibes virtuoso Gary Burton and reflects it through a hall of mirrors of overdubbed, wordless
    female vocals.  Weber also includes some decently jazzy sideman gigs, including his vigorous accompaniment
    on Metheny's composition ""The Whopper"", named for Weber's favorite American sandwich.</p><p>
    But as Weber entered the 80s, he moved even further towards the neo-classical, largely composed music that
    he's making now, where the improvisation naps within a refined, chamber ensemble-like environment.  Of a
    track from 1982, Weber writes in the liner notes, ""For my favourite sequence on 'Maurizius' I have to wait
    4 minutes and 16 seconds.  I guess one has to be a musician to understand that.""  Actually, even teenagers
    know that ""Stairway to Heaven"" doesn't start with the guitar solo.  But if the somewhat breathless lilt that
    hits halfway through the piece is worth waiting for, ""Maurizius"" mostly sounds limp and channeled, especially
    under the deathly peaceful reeds of Windham Hill artist Paul McCandless.  Likewise, the final track, 2001's
    ""French Diary"", swells and paces like a soap opera-soundtrack.  Weber actually sits this one out, so set on
    being a composer that he blows off his stature as one of ECM's greatest bass improvisers.  The piece suffers
    without him.</p><p>
    ""There is a great discrepancy between classical music and jazz in that classical music concentrates more on
    the tried-and-tested, while in jazz the focus is more on the experimental,"" writes Weber.  ""And favoring
    emotion and spontaneity, however superficial, some people-- critics included-- often lose sight of quality.""
    He's got me there, because ECM's worst-- by which I mean, coziest-- music favors quality over invention.
    You can often learn the most about an artist, or a label, from his most boring recordings, because that's
    when the clichés and old habits come out.  ECM has been typecast as gorgeous but complacent, and it's
    sometimes called the father of new age because it let slip all the tension and conflict that new age
    dispensed with entirely.  So it fits that instead of reevaluating or, God forbid, judging these artists,
    these artist compilation discs would turn into souvenir-style recordings.</p><p>
    But does friendliness make great music?  Weber makes a cogent case for how he got to his present work, but
    he doesn't make room for the pieces that don't fit.  He's too busy polishing his epitaph to remember that
    some musicians make their best work when they don't sound like themselves-- when they wrestle with new ideas,
    instead of sinking into the same familiar, quality-controlled surroundings.</p></div>"|8777.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8777-selected-recordings/|5.6|Chris Dahlen

    ground that this Las Vegas quartet sprang from before phrases like ""bidding war"" and ""headlining tour""
    entered their daily vocabulary.  But it can afford this bit of honesty, since the British music press has
    shouldered the load of attendant Killers hyperbole, and because the band's <i>Hot Fuss</i> checks most of
    its truths at the door to their 800-foot limo.</p><p>
    By autumn 2003, their single ""Mr. Brightside"" had secured the usual Best! Band! Ever! overstatements from
    UK scribes, and the song's happily vacant grafting of New Order decadence to Housemartins bop bounced it
    hard into <i>CMJ</i> and SXSW.  Subsequently, the band's dance card attracted Warbucksian suitors of the
    largest variety.  And now, the resulting <i>Hot Fuss</i> drops on both sides of the Atlantic wrapped in
    this tabloid backstory, unable to separate its hype from its unabashedly referential sound.</p><p>
<i>Hot Fuss</i> floats boatloads of blasé lyrics about the pressures of being fabulous and the politics of
    fucking over an easily sippable blend of 80s and 90s British pop influences, rarely pausing to test the end
    product.  Top-shelf mixing and attention to melody helps out the record's appeal as lifestyle music for
    sheltered bloggers and female professionals who still wear cool hairstyles.  But damnit if that demographic
    leaves little room for a life of The Killers' own.  Where are they, besides their wily references to past
    pop pros and a vague sense of Sin City cynicism?  Not anywhere, really: The Killers are just the latest band
    to be born too quick inside the popular music vacuum, where expectations for broad accessibility kill dudes'
    potential for deeper creativity quite fabulously dead.</p><p>
    This is disappointing, since <i>Fuss</i>' better moments make The Killers' knack for hooks and cool poses
    clear.  Vocalist/keyboardist Brandon Flowers has replaced his tonsils with melodrama; he's hijacked Jarvis
    Cocker's accent to make his Vegas-boy rep sound that much tighter.  ""Brightside"" isn't getting near the
    dejection of The Stills; it has no illusions about being anything other than a provocative single.  Its
    relentless keyboard 'n' guitar racket shuns dourness altogether, as Flowers remarkably makes lines about a
    girlfriend getting off with some other guy resonate as some kind of weird triumph.  ""Somebody Told Me""'s
    deadpan couplets about having a ""boyfriend who looks like a girlfriend"" are similarly clever, but the cut's
    a brazen rewrite of The Strokes' treble-kick heroics.  Yes, Casablancas, et al ripped off pieces of their
    sound, too, but that's the difference-- they already did the ripping.  The Killers' recombination arrives
    too late to be recognized as first-tier thievery.  At this point, <i>Hot Fuss</i> is just bringing it from
    what's already been brought.</p><p>
<i>Hot Fuss</i> opener ""Jenny Was a Friend of Mine"" establishes Flowers' admirable love for tones lost to
    rockers' rising fears of sounding too fruity.  But as the album's singles follow in quick succession,
    rocking a sound softer than post-punk but full of the stuff that came right after it, The Killers can't
    figure a way to add resonance beyond adding more keyboards, more layered guitars, more cribbing of established
    tastemaking currency (check the intellectual-property-case-waiting-to-happen that is ""Change Your Mind"").
    In other words, <i>Hot Fuss</i> has no use for subtlety.  It revels in its appearance as The Shit from day
    one, allowing for filler-type indulgences like the impossibly aimless-- and quite possibly shitty--
    ""Everything Will Be Alright"".  Meanwhile, <i>Fuss</i>' UK version excises the brazenly contemporary
    raggedness of ""Change Your Mind"" for the astoundingly inane ""Indie Rock 'n' Roll"", a blaring joke of
    thick-chorded guitar and arrogant, pitch-corrected yowling that gives out cornholes to every unknown
    American group valiantly trying to find the cracks of creativity in its titular sound.</p><p>
    So, it's plain that The Killers have made a record more concerned with artifice than artistry.  If the
    intent is to place their album's principal teases on the next <i>Now That's What I Call Music</i>
    compilation, then bravo.  But why does it try to squeak by as another deft pop reversion when it actually
    seems to be a revisionist cash dance?  For the kids, I presume.  But <i>Hot Fuss</i> is not hardcore; it's
    hard evidence that it's tough to focus on making great rock when you're preoccupied with cultivating an
    image.</p></div>"|4579.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4579-hot-fuss/|5.2|Johnny Loftus

As
    backwards-ballcap macro-rock lathers more gesso onto radio, pointyheads like Four Tet's Kieran Hebden
    and Kammerflimmer Kollektief's Thomas Weber having been discovering zany new colors to paint with.  The
    Brooklyn-by-way-of-Portland label Temporary Residence has spent eight years ignoring the grunge fallout
    while going to the mat for these kinds of experimenters.  In a span of time that's seen thousands of
    manufactured jean-shorts purchased by those who like the way Wes Scantlin slaps their ass, Temporary
    Residence has faithfully brought the bliss and sticky sustenance.  Now, for its 50th release, the label
    is celebrating those moments of its life with some exclusive and intuitive content from its raft of
    creative pals.</p><p>
    
    This is stuff that takes its time getting to that land without borders, where fortresses of turbulence
    rise in EKG spike valleys.  Alongside his bandmates in Fridge, Hebden spends nearly 10 minutes doting
    over ""Five Combs""' sprightly little four-note figure; snatches of a broadcast become an alternating rhythm
    to the normal tickle of glitchy push-button percussion; and music boxes harmonize with descending pianos.
    For Weber's incredible Kammerflimmer Kollektief (hooray for consonants!), hiss is the weapon.  What sounds
    like the chatter of a thousand GoBot grasshoppers connects ""Eiderdaunen [Version]""'s subtle snare brushes
    to damaged jazz soloing and an excerpt from some abandoned love theme.</p><p>
    
    These tracks find the organic intangible in their assemblages of mouse clicks and effects units.  But
    their electronic signatures also heighten the effect of Howard Hello's ""The One"", whose gentle acoustic
    guitar and vintage keyboard buzz sound nearly exotic.  This is what's so rewarding about the nebulous
    scene Temporary Residence documents: It can be both electronic and organic, wooden and plastic.  Tube
    amps sit in practice rooms next to notebook computers; the warm yellow glow of a Guild Acoustics body
    reflects an LCD screen's chilly blue wallpaper.</p><p>
    
    While pretty sedate throughout, <i>Thank You</i> does offer some roar with ""I Can't See Anything When I
    Close My Eyes"", a nervy live number from San Francisco's Rumah Sakit.  There's also an extended bout of
    near-feedback soloing jammed into the center of Kilowatthours and JDV's otherwise tranquil (and awesomely
    named) ""Jignauseum"".  Then, Parlour conjure the thick groove of 5ive Style with ""Landlaked"", before
    Explosions in the Sky return to <i>Thank You</i>'s more formless and peaceful side for ""The Long Spring"".
    Sybarite follow suit, blurring the line between warm blood and circuitry perfectly, and turning their
    ""Killing the Moonshine"" into a snaky meander of melody and mainframe.</p><p>
    
    Just now, while you weren't looking, another bar band covered Puddle of Mudd.  And, depending on how many
    inflatable promotional items were in the room, the crowd probably loved it.  But at the same time in another
    room, a tangle of wires just emitted a wavering tone, and three or four dudes riffed on it with jumbles of
    axes and software.  Some people find home in chunkheaded modern rock generica, and that's fine.  But for
    those with the time to explore, there's a Temporary Residence waiting in the goofy cosmos.</p></div>"|2049.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2049-thank-you/|7.5|Johnny Loftus

    doing it every time he cuts an album.  Joyner puts down page upon page of stuff like, ""Up in the hot air
    balloon the priest of lime blessed the wind and gave it reason to cover everything that dies/ But you
    weren't surprised the mirror had advised you to look no further for a villain/ Still the Senator's thug
    is sucking your thumb/ Trying to turn a black hat into a white one.""  When he's done, he hits the studio
    with friends like Michael Krassner, Fred Lonberg-Holm and Jim White, where suddenly he becomes the lost
    son of Leonard Cohen, spreading his words across a skeletal backing with his temperamental baritone.</p><p>
    
    The Cohen comparison comes as much from the dour, literate tone of Joyner's work as it does from the sound
    of the music itself.  Joyner's poems become sprawling, broken ballads, the individual songs almost incidental
    to the overall epic arc of the whole album.  Whereas his last two albums of original compositions, 2001's
    <i>Hotel Lives</i> and 1999's <i>The Lousy Dance</i>, employed fairly broad instrumental palettes, <i>Lost
    with the Lights On</i> (his seventh, if you include his covers album) is immersed in gothic folk with
    occasional steel guitar flourishes.  Piano and cello provide most of the album's color, and songs unfold
    at a pace a 90-year-old man would feel comfortable driving at, lingering for seven and eight minutes with
    no concessions to such widely employed songwriting conventions as choruses and bridges.</p><p>
    
    In the three years since his last album, Joyner seems to have found more time for, if not outright optimism,
    then at least lightness.  ""Flying Dreams"" is almost joyous, with a buoyant melody and nearly whimsical
    delivery-- though it's important to note that all of the happiness in the song occurs while he sleeps.
    And, of course, there's still disaster around the corner: ""Flying dreams can turn ugly, too/ The plane
    nosedives out of the blue/ And spirals out of control/ When everything was so still before.""</p><p>
    
    The album's most startling song is easily its closer, ""Forgotten Blues"", whose backing sounds essentially
    like a parlor blues band melting, the instruments combining with Beefheartian random precision as White
    drops two and three snare hits at a time from his drum part to leave huge gaps of open space for the
    wandering electric guitars to fall into.  As the busted blues staggers sideways and Joyner's poetry book
    slams shut, the album feels remarkably complete for something uses none of the bookending techniques that
    so often make records feel like tidy statements.  Structurally, <i>Lost with the Lights On</i> is more
    like a modernist novel than an album, a glimpse into a point in someone's life somewhere between fulfillment
    and despair with no real beginning middle or end, and somehow it works.</p></div>"|4307.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4307-lost-with-the-lights-on/|7.3|Joe Tangari

    bought an orchestra.  Idea-starved and angst-weary, notable indie rock figureheads have been turning to
    the time-honored 70s supergroup writer's block remedy; namely, when in doubt, just add strings.  Following
    the lush-struck lead of Lambchop and The Flaming Lips, more than a few bands have sought to <i>Soft Bulletin</i>ize
    their sound, from Tim DeLaughter's cult of Coyne, The Polyphonic Spree, to the no-longer-in-denial soft-rock
    renegades of Belle &amp; Sebastian.</p><p>
    
    As such, The Silent League's aim of getting all orchestrational with their indie-pop doesn't exactly read
    like the most groundbreaking thesis upon which to base a band in today's underground landscape.  Like many
    other crowded-tour-bus acts, the more personnel-heavy tracks of <i>The Orchestra, Sadly, Has Refused</i>
    draw heavily upon the Spectorphonics of <i>All Things Must Pass</i>, right down to the George-esque slide
    guitar filling of ""Goliath"".  Sprinkle in some Richard Wright ""Us and Them""-style piano balladeering
    (there's even consecutive songs called ""Time"" and ""Breathe"") and you have an album that fits in quite well
    with the sensibilities of Pitchfork's recent best of the 70s list-- but made thirty years and hundreds of
    similar-sounding albums too late.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the strings and horns rarely do much more than add a thin layer of dressing to the rather
    plain lettuce of the songs beneath.  Silent League frontman Justin Russo is likable in songwriting and vocal
    regards, but the arrangements seem a far cry from a revolutionary new spin on the chamber-pop sound, and
    more like a lack of confidence manifesting itself in over-instrumentation.  Accordingly, Russo-- who is
    occasionally joined here by Mercury Rev's Sean ""Grasshopper"" Mackowiack and Interpol's Sam Fogarino--
    largely drops the orchestral concepts two songs in, and takes on a more stripped down piano-led band that is
    thoroughly and utterly uncontroversial.  Songs like ""Breathe"" and ""Linus"" content themselves with no more
    garnish than the occasional vibes and guitar jangle, and succeed in a sort of mom-friendly <i>Classics IV</i>
    fashion.</p><p>
    
    Still, all things told it's hard to conjure up much active dislike for an album like <i>The Orchestra, Sadly,
    Has Refused</i>, as it commits no crime other than complaisance.   On one hand, it's distressing to hear
    a <i>new</i> act pass Go and immediately jump to the ""Conducted by Michael Kamen"" stage, with little
    innovation to add to the field.  But on the other hand, as the temples of the indie world continue to
    grey, it only makes sense that a demand for neutered soft-rock grows stronger.  After all, indie kids will
    someday grow to become dentists, too, and they certainly can't play Fugazi in their waiting rooms.</p></div>"|7765.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7765-the-orchestra-sadly-has-refused/|5.0|Rob Mitchum

And yet in practice, despite the fact that it is exactly as outlined above, Kafka quotes     and all, there is absolutely nothing exclusive or contrived-feeling about it. In fact, not only is Richter's     second album one of the finest of the last six months, it is also one of the most affecting and universal     contemporary classical records in recent memory.</p>
<p>But how to describe music that relies so completely on seeming familiar?  Richter may fancy himself in a     class with Philip Glass, Brian Eno and Steve Reich (indeed, his hyperattenuated sense of minimalism owes     to all three), but unlike his influences, he's not remotely interested in subverting the traditional rules     of composition.  Short of one very beautiful moment that plunges an electronic sublow bassline into a deep     sea of harpsichords and violas (see: the literally perfect ""Shadow Journal""), there is nothing here to     suggest that Richter is concerned with anything other than melody and economy.  It's a formula he singlemindedly     exploits with staggering effectiveness for the balance of the album's 40+ minutes.</p>
<p>Constituted mainly of sparse pieces that lean on string quartets and pianos in equal measure, <i>The Blue     Notebooks</i> is a case study in direct, minor-key melody.  Each of the piano pieces ""Horizon Variations"",     ""Vladimir's Blues"" and ""Written in the Sky"" establish strong melodic motifs in under two minutes, all the     while resisting additional orchestration.  Elsewhere, Richter's string suites are similarly striking; ""On     the Nature of Daylight"" coaxes a stunning rise out of gently provincial arrangements while the comparatively     epic penultimate track ""The Trees"" boasts an extended introductory sequence for what is probably the album's     closest brush with grandiosity.  Richter's slightly less traditional pieces also resound; both the underwater     choral hymnal ""Iconography"" and the stately organ piece ""Organum"" echo the spiritual ambience that characterized     his work for Future Sound of London.</p>
<p>If, however, there is one piece that fires <i>The Blue Notebooks</i> off into the stratosphere, it's the     aforementioned ""Shadow Journal"".  Featuring a lone viola, some burbling electronics, a harpsichord and a     subterranean bassline, it establishes a simple, keening melody and then gently pulls it wide, like warm     string taffy, across its eight minutes.  The fourth track on the record, it is nonetheless its centerpiece,     and on a larger scale, possibly a gigantic beacon for composers searching for useful ways to introduce dance     music's visceral, body-jarring qualities into the classical sphere.</p>
<p>But make no mistake, this is not Richter's electronic/classical crossover, nor it is really his concept     record.  In fact, with songs that similarly forgo the temptations of complexity and choice so as to preserve     their core ideas, it's perhaps better thought of as his four-track demo, his lo-fi recording jaunt.  It's     Max Richter testing himself to see what he can produce under restraint.  Turns out it's more than he might     have otherwise.</p></div>"|6917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6917-the-blue-notebooks/|8.7|Mark Pytlik

The world of lo-fi pop is already rife with contrived boyishness and
    adolescent sophistry, but with <i>Tectonic Membrane/Thin Strip on an Edgeless Platform</i>, Matheny has
    lowered the bar to a near-unlimboable level.  Emperor X, the ominous-sounding alias behind the Gainesville,
    FL singer/songwriter's giddy pop alchemy, is merely a feeble façade.  The real Matheny is a devout homebody,
    and his story runs like so: Born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1979, Matheny was tinkering with an SK-1 sampling
    keyboard, given to him by his grandparents, at age nine, and with a little help from his pawn-shop-patronizing
    dad, he recorded his first album on a Tascam four-track before turning 20.  In fact, throughout his congenital
    musical career, Matheny's family has played an integral role, and it shows: <i>Tectonic Membrane/Thin Strip
    on an Edgeless Platform</i> is one of the most winsome and charmingly diminutive lo-fi records of the moment,
    weaving a sturdy matrix of reliable pop nuggets.</p><p>
    While <i>Tectonic Membrane</i> embodies and relishes the four-track aesthetic, Matheny's compositions are
    deceptively complex.  Listen carefully and you'll hear intricate overdubbing and a bevy of digital affectations,
    ranging from retro synths to more up-to-date pedals and tinker toys.  The 8\xBD-minute ""Intracellular"" is flooded
    in amorphous guitar peals and keyboard swells, and would feel right at home amongst the work of similarly
    lo-fi process artists or latter-day Black Dice.  In spite of his sly technological sophistication, however,
    Matheny maintains an air of trembling innocence throughout the record, which dabbles in divergent styles
    and moods.  Surprisingly, these songs' oft tenuous resolutions and child-like lack of focus are seldom as
    irksome as they seem on paper, and generally enhance Emperor X's ingratiating aesthetic.</p><p>
    Appropriately, opener ""Exterminata Beat"" is the most immediately engaging track.  Propelled by a motorik
    pop beat, Matheny turns in a demure vocal performance and an irrepressible distorted Rhodes harmony, before
    the mix abruptly cuts off and an audibly conducted choral segue fades in.  It's a discomfiting juxtaposition
    at first, but as Emperor X's ambitions become clearer, the move seems more and more appropriate.  ""Laminate
    Factory"", which features a serpentine vocal melody over jagged acoustic strumming, clarifies things somewhat,
    but it's not until ""Bashling"" that <i>Tectonic Membrane</i> solidifies its standing as a handsomely potluck
    gem.  Indebted to an array of shoegazer outfits-- particularly Yo La Tengo in its rising, tremolo-laden
    guitars-- the song adds some gravity to this occasionally flighty collection.</p><p>
    Matheny is an unabashedly wanting singer, and while some may see that as part of his appeal, it occasionally
    edges on bothersome.  ""Filene's Basement"" is most off-putting in its cryptic narrative and clunky delivery,
    but fortunately, the song skirts by in under two minutes, and its effect on the flow of the album is
    negligible at worst.  Elsewhere, ""Unworthiness Drones"" is a directionless rhythmic experiment that does
    hamper the momentum slightly, especially when it arbitrarily tails off after a bout of spasmodic stuttering.</p><p>
    Luckily, such miscues keep a relatively low profile, and the preponderance of enduring melodies is a
    formidable saving grace.  Most will agree that the last thing underground music needs is more Phil Elvrum
    wanna-bes and lo-fi dilettantes, which is why Chad Matheny's efforts are so impressive.  Constantly battling
    the odds and winning, <i>Tectonic Membrane</i> is an easy album to champion, and a refreshing show for
    a floundering genre.</p></div>"|11735.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11735-tectonic-membranethin-strip-on-an-edgeless-platform/|7.8|Sam Ubl

Because he shared a wall with the avant
    folkie, he never dared listen to anything by one of his favorite bands, Gastr del Sol-- not even <i>Crookt,
    Crackt or Fly</i>.  I thought his neurosis was fairly amusing, especially because I couldn't imagine those
    nimble Grubbs/O'Rourke outtakes passing through the ancient Brooklyn plaster.  (No, not even the loud parts.)
    And though said friend has long since relocated to a different, shadier part of the borough, if he had
    remained opposite the man behind <i>A Guess at the Riddle</i>, I'd tell him to buck up and blast Grubbs'
    fourth solo album as loudly as he wanted to, since even when Grubbs opts to amp things here, the results
    seem so spidery and fragile.</p><p>
    
    For the past decade plus, Grubbs has donned a number of hats.  There were his raucous Louisville days with
    the mathy Bastro and the distorted power-pop of Squirrel Bait.  Later, he moved to Chicago where he would
    cut the aforementioned Gastr LPs with O'Rourke, as well as a couple of classy solo records and Pythagorean
    punk-slaps with Tony Conrad, Pauline Oliveros, and Arnold Dreyblatt, among others.  And finally, upon
    arriving in New York, he presented a split-down-the-middle 12-inch with Animal Collective wood sprite Avey Tare
    and a disc with outer-realms guitarist Loren Connors.</p><p>
    
    On <i>A Guess at the Riddle</i>, Grubbs eases further into the deep-end of his pristine poppiness-- which
    is not to say that our master of ceremonies has left behind off-color time signatures, spacy repetitions,
    or heady lyrical introversion.  Even with his tempered outbursts restrained, and despite the lyrical hail
    storms, this is Grubbs' most straightforward and upbeat album.</p><p>
    
    The album's countless references to precipitation may hide the answer to its title's riddle.  Perhaps it's
    something to do with the weather (inside and outside), and the loneliness or beauty that can spring from
    sporadic rain showers and shifts in clouds?  Or not.  But even if Grubbs is just being rhetorical, a close
    reading of the lyric sheet reveals that during ""A Cold Apple"", Hilda consumes icy fruit on ""an equally cold/
    On an equally bright/ Absolutely sunshot/ To-be-savored Sunday morning.""  Likewise, there's a ""forecast for
    cloudy skies"" on the ebullient Eggs-veined opener, ""Knight Errant"".  In the Rick Moody-penned ""Wave
    Generators"", the <i>Ice Storm</i> author mentions a delay of game due to the poetry of ""icicle fringe"" and
    frozen creeks.  Elsewhere, there are eclipses and barometric swoons.  ""Hurricane Season"" (another by
    Moody) features a ""hurricane town, bleached white/ Under black convectionary clouds.""</p><p>
    
    Musically, this lengthy Sufjan Stevens cacophony spins out electronically, spreading wings and becoming its
    namesake with the help of guesting electronic duo Matmos.  Even the Mayo Thompson cover ""Magnificence as
    Such"" gets in on the rain dance with ""foghorns on foggy days"" as the backdrop for a walk in the countryside
    wherein the protagonist is struck by the beauty of light reflected off soot.  But you don't need words to
    feel the wind!  And so even the majority of the instrumentals partake in the cloudgazing: ""Rosie Ruiz""
    finds Grubbs on electric guitar and computer, making Moody's icicles of sound.  The fittingly titled final
    track, ""Coda (Breathing)"", proffers deep listening with its swirling harmonium and Steve Roden's minimalist
    processing.</p><p>
    
    As on all of his projects, when Grubbs looks for outside help, he assembles a free-range bumper-crop: Adam
    Pierce of Mice Parade plays drums, as does Calexico collaborator Thomas Belhom.  Bar/None vocalist Hannah
    Marcus doubles in the background, and a bevy of European improv folks like cellist Nikos Veliotis add
    atmosphere.  Finally, Norwegian electronic musician and visual artist Kim Hiorthoy places cumulous formations
    and blackened raindrops (and arcs and swoons) on the cover sleeve.</p><p>
    
    So now that I've established the forecast, do the songs work?  Yes and no.  A number of the earlier tracks--
    especially the first quartet-- are spot-on and engaging, but roughly halfway through the record, Grubbs
    squanders this momentum for arty ponderousness.  The off-Broadway piano ditty ""Your Neck in the Woods""
    snores, and the decidedly tame Matmos collaboration ""You'll Never Tame Me"" is nothing but a noodle fest.
    Additionally, Grubbs is sometimes so precise in his articulation that the work lacks a properly ragged
    soul.  So, no, <i>A Guess at the Riddle</i> doesn't quite amaze.  Nitpicking though I may be, Grubbs'
    follow-up to <i>Rickets &amp; Scurvy</i> displays a vibrant palette that, despite some duds, offers several
    slices of inventive and exploratory pop.  Just don't forget your umbrella.</p></div>"|3584.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3584-a-guess-at-the-riddle/|7.4|Brandon Stosuy

    warbly voice.  The title suggests someone dumbly loyal, either blessed or afflicted with a canine devotion
    to a lover, to friends, or to certain romantic ideas about life.  In keeping with recent albums like
    <i>Cobblestone Runway</i> and <i>Blue Boy</i>, producer Martin Terefe sets Sexsmith's voice against a
    lively full-band sound and bolsters it with dream-weaver string flourishes on ""Whatever It Takes"" and ""Not
    About to Lose"".  Generally, the music recalls Jon Brion's work with Mann and Fiona Apple, but is never so
    garishly ostentatious.</p><p>
    
    As usual, <i>Retriever</i> also features Sexsmith's studiously plainspoken lyrics, which work hard to reveal
    a great deal without being stylistically idiosyncratic; he truly wants everyone to sing along to these songs
    about ""happiness"" and ""sadness.""  ""Hard Bargain"" is a surprisingly well-adjusted love song: ""How's a guy
    supposed to fail/ With someone like you around?""  If he didn't sound so convincingly smitten, you might
    think this was a parody of those dark ballads so full of self-loathing and self-absorption.  And when he
    sings lines like, ""I've seen tomorrow in her eyes,"" or, ""Dreams come true in heaven all the time,"" not only
    is he keeping a straight, wholly unironic face, but he's almost self-consciously risking cornball sentiment.
    He barely skirts this pitfall, but his willingness to tread that line creates an awkward vulnerability that
    only makes him more endearing.</p><p>
    
    On the other hand, can someone be too earnest?  The same indefatigable hopefulness that sets Sexsmith apart
    also makes <i>Retriever</i> a bit tiresome.  He instills every song with such gentle, unaffected feeling that
    <i>Retriever</i> becomes monochromatic, lacking emotional variety.  A smirk or even a knowing one-liner
    would have shaded that directness with some welcome humor.</p><p>
    
    The overearnestness takes the bite out of more topical songs like ""From Now On"" and ""Wishing Wells"", where
    his uncomplicated lyrics become a liability.  Propelled by Ed Harcourt's piano, ""From Now On"" could even
    make a rousing theme song for John Kerry's campaign-- especially if the musician-turned-candidate performed
    it himself.  The lyrics, however, are too obvious and hammer-blunt: ""We live in times/ Where choice is frowned
    upon/ Afraid to even raise/ Our voice in song.""</p><p>
    
    But that same song contains another few lines-- ""They're in the business of panic and control/ We're in the
    business of the heart and the soul""--that bristle with heart-on-sleeve righteousness.  Sexsmith is always a
    little more complicated than he appears, and his quiet perseverance-- through each song as well as over the
    course of his career-- carries its own intricate poetry that belies the understatement of his persona.</p></div>"|7764.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7764-retriever/|7.3|Stephen M. Deusner

Literal cheese does share at least one trait with its
    adjectival counterpart (i.e. ""cheesy""):  it's polarizing.  While many people love cheese, and some hate it,
    few are ambivalent.  Go ahead; test my theory.  Ask 50 strangers if they'd like a nice wedge of sharp
    cheddar.  Some will say, ""Cheddar?  Hell yes, please.""  Others will say, ""No! I cannot stand cheese!""  Many
    will just walk away quickly and have to be counted as the control group in this flawed experiment, since
    what the hell are you doing offering cheese to strangers?  However, I'd wager that not a single one would
    be like, ""Cheese?  Whatever.""</p><p>
    
    Biggie once asked: ""What's beef?"" (and unfortunately, he found out).  I now ask: What's cheese?  Cheese is
    difficult to pin down.  Like postmodernism, grace, or pornography, we know cheese when we see it, and can
    list its qualities all day without attaining its complete essence.  For one: Cheese is earnest, although
    not everything that's earnest is cheesy.  For another: Cheese is ostentatious, the dubious life of the party.
    It does not slip in, fashionably late, through the side entrance.  It storms in through the front door in
    a sequined tuxedo with lace cuffs, recites a ribald limerick and spikes the punch with peppermint schnapps.
    Cheese is grandiose, and not afraid to be maudlin-- there is no obfuscation with cheese, no artful hedging
    of bets: Cheese is heart-sleeved and money-mouthed, and it dares you to insult it for being what it proudly proclaims itself to be.</p><p>
    
    Why is cheese important?  Well, it isn't.  Cheese, by its very nature, is frivolous.  But it is important
    within the context of this review, because your relative lactose tolerance is going to drastically influence
    your response to this record.  See that rating up there?  Numerical ratings are troublesome.  Numbers are
    stately and immutable; in their absolute precision, they limn what is, for all intents and purposes, a
    personal judgment (one heavily influenced, in this case, by my own relationship with cheese, which is not
    what one would call ""close"") as an objective, universal one.</p><p>
    
    So, what you'll need to do is consider your own personal affinity for cheese, which can be measured by any
    number of factors: How well do you like Liberace?  Notoriously bad sitcoms?  Black velvet paintings,
    preferably of Elvis, bullfighters, or Elvis fighting a bull?  Do you enjoy ""theme restaurants,"" especially
    if the theme is indeterminate and mainly involves a glut of random pop cultural detritus hanging from the
    walls?  Next, rate your affinity for cheese on a scale ranging from -5 to +5.  Here, -5 will signify that
    you have a deep-seated anathema for cheese, and +5 will indicate a deep-seated appreciation.  Once you have
    your personal cheese affinity rating nailed down, add or subtract it to the rating above in order to
    determine the rating for The Helio Sequence's <em>Love and Distance</em> that best suits you. </p><p>
    
    Now that we've articulated a sort of sliding-scale, individually specific model of cheese appreciation, I
    can go on record as saying, without it being taken as a putatively objective value judgment: The Helio
    Sequence's <em>Love and Distance</em> is <em>fucking cheesy</em>.  And now that we've pretty thoroughly
    unpacked the mysterious qualities of cheese and devised a foil to offset its destabilizing properties
    (as in, my personal disdain for cheese would have pulled the rating unconscionably low otherwise), we
    can discuss the quality of the music outside of its cheesiness, which is actually not bad. </p><p>
    
    The Helio Sequence is a duo comprised of singer/guitarist Brandon Summers and keyboardist/drummer Benjamin
    Weikel, who drummed for Modest Mouse during Jeremiah Green's leave of absence.  (What, did you think we were
    reviewing this because I was dying to talk about cheese?).  And so you're wondering: How does it stack up
    to Modest Mouse?  Well, you know how there was Death Cab for Cutie, and then there was this side project
    called The Postal Service, and heads were like, ""Whoa, this side project is better than the main draw""?
    Well, this is nothing like that.</p><p>
    
    The two bands do, however, share some common traits: The Helio Sequence blend bright electronica, pop
    melodies, and various stylized sound effects.  But vocally, I take issue with their tendency to veer
    towards the recent work of-- and I really hate to say this, but-- Dave Matthews.  And yet, there are some
    killer melodies peeking out from beneath this band's Velveeta blanket: The songs are sharply constructed,
    featuring layer upon layer of electronic and live percussion, synth patches, guitars, and sundry other
    bells and whistles that somehow keep away from the overly dense side of things and manage to blast out in
    tight pop songs.  However, their reliance on harmonica on the opening ""Harmonica Song"" is a troubling sign
    of things to come, and lends the music a quality not unlike that of the mid-90s road anthem ""Life Is a
    Highway"".  Which is bad to me, but may be good to you.</p><p>
    
    The duo's 2000 debut, <i>Com Plex</i>, and its follow-up <i>Young Effectuals</i> exhibited none of these
    traits-- rather, The Helio Sequence simply attempted some harmless Beatle mimicry in a show of future
    potential.  Unfortunately, <i>Love and Distance</i> showcases a band that has clearly fully realized its
    sound, but in doing so have abandoned many of the attributes that once held so much promise.  The result
    is certainly ambitious-- one could never say that lots of care and detail work wasn't put into this
    record; it's just a shame that their affectations and identity-forming flourishes have led them to a
    sound that discards their once-unmistakable My Bloody Valentine influence for that of HORDE tour
    second-stagers.  Then again, you might like Blues Traveller.</p></div>"|3805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3805-love-and-distance/|5.0|Brian Howe

    full-length albums.  There are lists of the best singles and albums, but no one's counting down the top
    ten extended players of the 90s. To an extent, it's because EPs have grown out of traditional vinyl singles
    and mutated into something less like a single-and-b-side and more like an album in miniature.</p><p>
    But where is it written that LPs are the most legitimate form of artistic expression?  Jens Lekman, who
    hails from Sweden, has already released two EPs this year: <i>Rocky Dennis</i> and <i>Maple Leaves</i>.
    Combine both and you've got a short, choppy album, so it's better to leave them separate as two well-realized
    half-albums of delicate chamber-pop songs full of waltzing strings, 60s-style flutes, and sundry psychedelias.
    Lekman sums up his musical approach best: ""I know every song, you name it/ By Bacharach or David/ Every
    stupid love song that's ever touched your heart/ Every power ballad that's ever climbed the charts.""</p><p>
    Of the two, <i>Rocky Dennis</i> is by far the more ambitious EP, and the least successful.  Its namesake
    was the real-life inspiration for the 1985 movie <i>Mask</i>, long forgotten by all but Lekman and a few
    Bogdanovich completists.  Roy L. ""Rocky"" Dennis suffered from craniodiaphyseal dysplasia, which swelled
    his face to twice its normal size; he died in 1980 at age 16.  Lekman sees the perpetual teenager as
    emblematic of his own skewed emotions and his dreamy quest for depth and meaning in life. On ""Jens Lekman's
    Farewell Song to Rocky Dennis"", he sings, ""I wish I had a proper reason to cry/ A reason not so abstract/
    More like a broken clause in a contract.""  While his overidentification with Dennis reflects an intense
    post-adolescent romanticism, it also seems a little exploitive, as if Dennis were John Merrick to Lekman's
    Michael Jackson.</p><p>
    If <i>Rocky Dennis</i> feels a little truncated, it's because the concept determines the EP's shape.  It's
    too thin to merit a full album, but four tracks just can't develop these ideas enough, especially when one
    of those tracks is only a minute's worth of orchestrated strings, with no vocals and no discernible theme.
    It's telling that the EP's best track, ""If You Ever Need a Stranger"", is the only one not specifically about
    Dennis.</p><p>
    Much less troubling and much more rewarding is <i>Maple Leaves</i>, which lacks its mate's overarching
    concept but still sounds more fully formed and unified.  The title track explodes in a symphony of keyboards,
    flutes, and curiously danceable drums, as Lekman sings about mishearing his lover's doubtful words: ""She
    said we were only make believe/ But I thought she said maple leaves.""  ""Sky Phenomenon"" and the cover of
    the Television Personalities' ""Someone to Share My Life With"" float along on his nimble piano and gentle
    baritone, which occasionally recalls Yo La Tengo's Ira Kaplan.  The EP's best moment comes with ""Black Cab"",
    a killjoy's lament about ruining a party, but not wanting to go home.  A monologue delivered from the rear
    seat of a taxi and accompanied by harpsichord and mandolin, it perfectly communicates the unshakable dread
    of wanting to be anywhere but where you are and anyone but who you are.</p><p>
    Lekman's youthful anomie is intense enough not only to excuse some of his missteps as merely oversincere,
    but also to redeem them as steeping-stones toward a larger goal.  You could call him pretentious, but his
    pretensions are so rawly naïve, his musical influences so particular, that these songs sound genuinely
    unique and wholly personal.  His vision, coupled with his youth (very early twenties), places him in an
    early-2004 minitrend of young artists like Patrick Wolf and Nellie McKay, both of whom have released
    staggeringly ambitious debuts exhibiting an incredibly strong grasp of style and genre.  Lekman's vision
    is never as ostentatious as Wolf's nor as charmingly psychotic as McKay's, but he seems to have mastered
    the subtle and never-so-simple trick of balancing joy and misery, such that neither overwhelms the other.
    That he does it in such a short time-- both EPs add up to only about 25 minutes-- makes each song all the
    more bittersweet.</p></div>"|11774.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11774-rocky-dennis-epmaple-leaves-ep/|7.0|Stephen M. Deusner

    lyrics and kitchen-sink production aesthetics who the press hastily and irresponsibly christens ""The New
    Beck.""  From Self to Forest for the Trees to Primitive Radio Gods, these artists rarely succeed on their
    own merits, patently distilling Beck's multifaceted styles into a calculated formula or half-bred hodgepodge
    pastiche.  Still, they come a dime-a-dozen, parading through rock's history books as footnotes at best on
    the strength of one radio-friendly sing-along (or less).  All of which is fittingly ironic for a man who
    himself is often referred to as ""The New Dylan.""</p><p>
    
    Oh, it's not all Mr. Hansen's fault, of course.  Cheap digital gear and bootleg copies of Garage Band
    shoulder part of the blame.  But corner that pesky Scientologist in an airport and he'll tell you straight
    out: It's a bitch keeping up with the kids, man, the muthafuckin' kids.  And that's where outfits like
    Boomkat, Samantha Ronson, and Bumblebeez 81 come in.  The first was a weirdly addictive combo that tried
    on tired trip-hop, teen-pop, and energetic yammering; the second will be Rocafella's summer '04 entry into
    faux-rock hipsterism (Miss Sam's first single sounds like Natalie Imbruglia covering stuff from Pink's
    <i>M!ssundaztood</i>); and the third is the Australia-via-NYC snip-pop project of one Chris Colonna and
    his merry coed crew.  Their debut, <i>The Printz</i>, compiles pieces of two earlier EPs for a record that's
    going to make poor Beck puke.</p><p>
    
    It's not like Colonna, his sister Vila, and their assorted collaborators (both human and machine) are
    better than Beck, or The Neptunes, or The Avalanches, or any other artist their record attempts to replicate;
    their trash/fash rehash resonates more than The Moldy Peaches' in-jokes only because <i>The Printz</i> is
    consistently hooky.  But as MTV2's <i>Subterranean</i> knows, it's the aesthetic that matters, and to that
    end, Bumblebeez 81 are where it's at for at least the next few minutes.</p><p>
    
    Frankly, it could be much worse.  Vila takes the mic for ""Microphone Diseases"": ""I flow like water in a
    stream/ I got the mad fuckin' scheme/ All up in my regime.""  Okay, it's not exactly <i>Def Poetry Jam</i>,
    but when she starts blabbering about putting placentas in blenders over a sample of a tennis volley, smart
    brains start thinking ""guilty pleasure.""  And the ESG update on the back end ain't bad, either.</p><p>
    
    Vila offers a much stronger mic presence than her brother, who tends toward mumbling as an affectation,
    and she wisely returns for ""Pink Fairy Floss"".  The song sounds more like Cibo Matto than anything; its
    hard squelch riff, Latin percussion loop, and elephant and Tone-Loc drop-ins are the stuff memorable
    make-out parties are made of.  She's at her best on the appropriately named ""Vila Attack"".  Bragging about
    her stale rhyming skills is both bold and daring, but the track's overdriven background layers harken
    wildly to those early 90s days when <i>Mellow Gold</i> was still fresh and Timmy Taylor hadn't yet been
    struck down in his prime.</p><p>
    
    So, contrary to what most press has already said, <i>The Printz</i> isn't hip-hop, nor does it have anything
    in common with the wiry post-punk it references on ""Step Back"" and ""Pony Ride"".  Still, Colonna's sneer is
    appropriate, and the nearly tuneless guitar throughout is sort of charming.  The album doesn't posit
    Bumblebeez 81 anywhere near staying-power square, though, because ultimately it's too reliant on
    recombination.  Beck might stay on top because he looks dope in Prada, but he's also intent on building a
    cohesive product from his myriad mental fragments.  <i>The Printz</i> is more of a pose.  It has its share
    of memorable moments, but they'll undoubtedly sound better if you're a) the coolest kid in your high school,
    or b) Milla Jovovich.  The record will also work wonders for Bumblebeez 81 and their burgeoning rep, but
    they gotta understand-- real recombinant music helps the heartland get some, too.</p></div>"|1115.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1115-the-printz/|6.0|Johnny Loftus

Zion Memorial Orchestra &amp; Tra-La-La Band with Choir,     and before that, simply A Silver Mt. Zion) is, if you want to get down to brass tacks, a different permutation     of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, the central hub from which the spokes of the Canadian post-rock scene seem     to radiate.  One of the most common accusations leveled at Godspeed is that their music is ""just one long     crescendo,"" and it's a complaint I've never understood.  For one, ""crescendo,"" when understood to mean ""a     peak,"" describes the moment when the music is at its most powerful, emphatic and cathartic: the aural     equivalent of an orgasm.  If this is the case, then hey, an hour-long orgasm doesn't sound like anything     to gripe about to me (<i>in theory</i>, I should add).</p>
<p>But moreover, while ""crescendo"" often describes ""a peak"" in modern usage, that isn't what it means.     ""Crescendo"" connotes not just the climax, but the climax <i>and</i> the entire slow-burning build toward     it.  It's not just the money shot, but all the foreplay and thrusting that preceded it.  Calling a climax     a crescendo is like calling a birth a pregnancy, and slow, dramatic intensification is pretty much     Godspeed's modus operandi-- to deride them for it is to admit that they fulfill the terms of their artistic     engagement, and is about as redundant as inveighing against a fantasy/adventure film for the implausibility     of its plot.</p>
<p>Whatever the word means to you, crescendo-haters who like Godspeed's overall style but can't get down with     the bombast might look more favorably on Thee Silver Mountain Reveries' <i>Pretty Little Lightning Paw</i> EP.  The disc benefits from many of Godspeed's concrete tactics (diverse instrumentation, nested political     polemics, long compositions with several distinct ""movements""), as well as their more abstract ones (a     certain incandescence, a tension between beauty and dread, a sense of light falling like rain).  And there's     nary a blatant crescendo-- be it build or climax-- to be found.</p>
<p><i>Pretty Little Lightning Paw</i> also profits from canning the aggressively off-key Choir who belted out     discordant shapenote harmonies all over their previous LP, <i>This is Our Punk-Rock, Thee Rusted Satellites     Gather + Sing</i>.  Of course, the jarring nature of the choir was intentional, and no doubt absolutely     salient in terms of the album's overall political and aesthetic program.  But it also frustratingly obscured     what was otherwise entirely lovely music, and soon enough emoted the record right out of my collection.'     Rather, <i>Pretty Little Lightning Paw</i> wafts through its four movements with equanimity and grace.</p>
<p>I've always felt ""post-rock"" to be a misnomer when applied to Godspeed, who seem more ""post-classical"" or     ""pre-something-heretofore-undreamt-of"" than anything else, and The Silver Mountain Whatevers have generally     followed suit.  But the first track on <i>Pretty Little Lightning Paw</i>, ""More Action! Less Tears!"", is     exactly what post-rock would be in a perfect world where words meant what they actually mean.  It opens     with a shout (""Hello?  There will be a meeting of the action committee in five minutes!""), followed by     flag-waving rock guitars and a production value straight off of GBV's <i>Bee Thousand</i>, which lends the     record a startling initial momentum uncommon to the genre.  In other words, it sounds like something it     would take Godspeed half an hour to build up to.</p>
<p>Like the remainder of the EP, ""Microphones in the Trees"" features Efrim Menuck's quavering, paranoid singing     about ""cameras in the sky"" and such; on this track his voice is modulated with an echo effect within a     glacial piano/bass/guitar figure that repeatedly accumulates and sheds feedback and choral harmonies (small     doses, small doses) in a 10-minute quest for cacophony.  The title track sounds like a slowed-down, vintage     RZA beat, all fractured minor-key shapes and syncopated drums.  It sounds how a reflected neon glow on     freshly fallen snow looks, and should excite those who pine for the days before Black Heart Procession     went bossanova.  And finally, ""There's a River in the Valley Made of Melting Snow"" closes the EP with Menuck's     most confident singing yet, stretched out over buzzing, staticky sheets of guitar.</p>
<p>I don't know what Thee Silver Mountain Reveries have in store for their next recording, but I think they're     on the right track with this one. Less is more, and if ""a crescendo"" must mean ""a peak,"" that still doesn't     mean it has to be overly dense or noisy-- if you were to drop a straight pin for an hour, then dropping a     ten-penny nail might be all the release you need.</p></div>"|7167.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7167-pretty-little-lightning-paw-ep-as-thee-silver-mountain-reveries/|7.6|Brian Howe

The duo have announced that they'll be
    taking their final bow at this summer's T in the Park, after headlining the Other Stage at last week's
    Glastonbury, the site of the stunning 1994 and 1995 performances that secured the band's legend and
    destroyed the myth that dance acts can't connect with audiences without the home-field advantage of a club.
    Orbital, of course, were no slouches in the studio either, producing some of the greatest electronic albums
    of their time and an immaculate string of singles that effortlessly segue from early acid and rave through
    the headier ambient techno of their mid-90s.</p><p>
    
    Orbital's swansong, <i>The Blue Album</i>-- their seventh-- is billed, worryingly, as a culmination of
    their 15-year run-- which, at least conceptually, implies a grab bag of token nods to better-realized
    ideas, or an unnecessary Cliff's Notes version of their career.  Thankfully, it's instead a fitting
    footnote, one that leaves a much better final taste in our mouths than the mostly disastrous <i>The
    Altogether</i>-- a record so misguided that it seems to have cloaked its underrated predecessor,
    <i>Middle of Nowhere</i>, in an ill-deserved shadow of post-<i>In Sides</i> disappointment.</p><p>
<i>The Blue Album</i> being a stroll through the past, innovation is not something one should expect from
    the record.  In a way, the album simply highlights many of the reasons why Orbital have been so beloved
    for the past decade-and-a-half.  However, one wouldn't come to that conclusion from the album opener,
    ""Transient"".  Almost beatless, this kaleidoscopic web of harpsichord, strings and bass, unfurls an almost
    foreboding yet captivating sound, recalling Philip Glass circa <i>Koyaanisqatsi</i>.</p><p>
    
    From there, Orbital deliver on their promise, taking us on a <i>Russian Ark</i>-like stroll through their
    career, echoing elements from <i>In Sides</i> (the serene ""Pants""), <i>Snivilisation</i> (""Bath Time"") and
    <i>The Middle of Nowhere</i> (the remarkable urban clang of ""Tunnel Vision"").  Of course, as on <i>The
    Altogether</i>, Orbital's stabs at humor here produce more cringes than smiles, as neither ""Bath Time""'s
    blend of children's TV theme music and Jean-Jacques Perrey nor ""Easy Serv""'s ice cream van xylophone--
    add much to the record.  Perhaps it would have nice to exorcise the tracks in favor of the sadly discarded
    ""Initiation"" and ""What Happens Next"", but a sense of humor has thankfully always been one element of
    Orbital's career and, if nothing else, this album is true to their legacy.</p><p>
    
    More than anything else, however, <i>The Blue Album</i> is reminiscent of Orbital's first two self-titled
    records, more commonly known as the <i>Green</i> and <i>Brown</i> albums.  Sparks collaboration ""Acid Pants""
    is an old-school, almost tribal banger, while the foreboding, abstract ""Lost"" sounds like an early effort
    from the Warp camp.  Best of all is album centerpiece ""You Lot"", the one track that could be segued into
    Orbital's first record without the bat of a single eyelash.  More track-y than most of their recent efforts--
    but with a soft ambient core, over which is layered a sample of Christopher Ecclestone babbling on about
    the shrinking distance between the power of man and God-- ""You Lot"" is the record's best confluence of what
    made Orbital so special.</p><p>
<i>The Blue Album</i> closes with ""One Perfect Sunrise"", the sort of post-rave/pre-dawn euphoria that
    Orbital perfected on ""Halcyon"".  And although the track borders on the nostalgic with the same potentially
    pointless intensity as a Jet track and the same emotional manipulation as a trance version of an 80s hit,
    here context can melt even the most time-hardened heart.  As the sunset to Orbital's glorious career, it's
    fitting that the track encapsulates the dawn, the time of day that has so often ended the most glorious
    moments of Orbital's career.</p></div>"|6033.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6033-the-blue-album/|7.3|Scott Plagenhoef

    and his new follow-up, <i>Fulfilled/Complete</i>, suggests two thematically linked works, a sequence telling
    a developing story.  This is entirely apt, as <i>Fulfilled/Complete</i> feels incredibly like a sequel to
    its predecessor, and true to the conventions of a sequel, this one makes the core character of its antecedent
    bigger, flashier and more extravagant.</p><p>
    
    The first Broken Spindles album grew out of would-be soundtrack work that Petersen was doing for a friend,
    but developed into a full-blown side project when that friend didn't use the music he'd made, and Omaha
    superproducer Mike Mogis joined him in the studio to help flesh out the material to album length.  What
    followed was a casually constructed instrumental record that flirted with industrial textures, much like
    The Faint themselves, and also branched into more atmospheric piano and vibraphone explorations.  On
    <i>Fulfilled/Complete</i>, Petersen adds vocals and a string quartet to that basic formula, and comes out
    with an album that splits its time rather awkwardly between buzzing, Faint-ish new-wave darkness and
    drifting navel contemplation for the 4AD set.</p><p>
    
    Petersen's vocals here generally operate in a staid robowhisper, and he leaves the real melodic heavy
    lifting to the piano and strings.  The most startling success among the vocal tracks is the first of them,
    ""Fall In and Down On"", a skittering beast of a song with vocals that glide by almost unnoticed amidst the
    cloud of frantically arranged pizzicato strings and bass buzz that surround them, slapping the chintzy,
    jungly drum programming around like a spoiled child.  This song and much of the rest of the album are
    infected with a gothic flair for ornate decoration and dark sentiment.</p><p>
    
    Piano/string interludes like ""Practice, Practice, Preach"" and ""To Die, For Death"", have a chilly, distant
    sadness to them that, while often compelling, makes them feel misplaced next to driving, heavily programmed
    songs like ""Move Away"" and ""Italian Wardrobe"" (think This Mortal Coil meets Public Image Ltd).  ""Events and
    Affairs"" is even more jarringly removed from the elegance that those instrumentals impart to the album, its
    cracked skin guitar and live drums forming a chassis that's about as quintessentially post-punk as you can
    get: Petersen's lyrics have him subscribing to the newspaper and buying a television to become more informed,
    and ultimately feeling let down by the narrow, misguided coverage they provide.  As media indictments go,
    it's not exactly brimming with subtlety.</p><p>
    
    Then again, I'm not sure subtlety is even in the vocabulary of The Faint, so maybe nuance is beside the
    point.  Either way, <i>Fulfilled/Complete</i> succeeds on a number of levels-- Mogis' recording is clear
    as a bell, there are several fine songs, and the string arrangements are impressively detailed-- but
    doesn't quite live up to either portion of its title, its sequencing too disjointed to make for a truly
    cohesive statement.  Still, at its best, the album is a pleasantly icy listen and a clearly above-average
    sequel.</p></div>"|11685.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11685-fulfilledcomplete/|6.9|Joe Tangari

    nature buffs The Skygreen Leopards.  To date, that duo's <i>One Thousand Bird Ceremonies</i> remains one of
    the more understated and addictive slabs of lo-fi pop to pass through the treehouse this year.  Now going
    it alone as Verdure, Quinn remains within that marble-green hemisphere, yet, where the Leopards write for
    the sunniest of Julys, Verdure spins a much more nocturnal cartography.  Originally self-released on CD-R
    and kept close among friends and associates, <i>The Telescope Dreampatterns</i> has been given a proper CD
    release by the Australian psych label Camera Obscura.</p><p>
    
    Even before listening to <i>The Telescope Dreampatterns</i>, a mood is established by its lush packaging:
    Chunky purple trees, moths, and skeletal root systems are rendered in glorious psych fashion on the cover
    by <i>Dream Magazine</i>'s George Parsons.  It's nearly as satisfying musically: Opener ""Into the Blacktrees""
    merges archaic acid-folk with a properly pained and dusted lyricism, relaying the tale of a shape-shifting
    dream state: ""I watched you take off your dress/ Lay yourself in the open road/ I didn't know if I should
    eat your flesh/ Or if I should pray for your soul/ Then you were two bluebirds at once/ And I watched you
    dancin' in the leaves/ And I watched you all of your life/ 'Til you disappeared into the black trees.""
    Quinn's cough-syrup vocal pacing here (and on ""Graveyard Porchlight"") is at times reminiscent of Dylan,
    but instrumentally, he shies from simple, straightforward folk by wrapping his dense hums and bows with
    the shade of a misty-eyed Skip Spence, the vibe of countless downer-psych players, and Native American
    tradition.</p><p>
    
    ""The Greentrees""' relaxed pacing allows chimes to ring and sustain entirely before dissolving; its interludes
    are opaque and spacious.  Organs drift, inducing a supine, dewy slumber, and when you finally catch a glimpse
    of these patterns, they feel like time-lapse guitar sparkle strummed and courted by Mr. Sandman: Quinn swivels
    into nightmare territory, but then quickly drifts back to idealized fluffy sheep and mossy hills.  Likewise,
    ""Fluttering Pastures"" recreates its evocative title with Gregorian chants, rising chimes and all sorts of
    stringed vibrations.  ""The Coffin Split in Two"" suggests the rock howl of The Seeds or The Troggs, and it
    delivers playful birdcalls over extant guitar wail.  In other spots, I can pick out Iran guitar walls and
    Twisted Village chimes.</p><p>
    
    There isn't much vocal and/or musical variation on the record, but this is a somnambulant daytrip, and, as
    with any level shoegaze plane, the lack of differentiation works to lull you into its zone.  Songs don't
    emerge from some freakout garden in the sky, but pick at Quinn's roots and you'll find tiny blooming strata
    twisting through the rocky patterns of decay in Parson's landscaping.  And the occasional instrumental adds
    some respite, giving the album the feel of a mystical found-sound field recording.  Through every crag,
    <i>The Telescope Dreampatterns</i> is the ideal immersion tank for watching fireflies collide under graveyard
    porchlights.  Now listen closely as they smear the summer with their woozy death-rattle glow.</p></div>"|8533.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8533-the-telescope-dreampatterns/|8.2|Brandon Stosuy

    are completely different entities that require different approaches and skill sets.  The Silver Jews' David
    Berman succeeds by amplifying and multiplying the accretion of image to be found in his songs, steering his
    compositions away from a singable one-liner quality, and toward more architecturally complex mansions of
    poetry.  Avant-garde MC Doseone, however, could be accused of writing his poems as if they were song lyrics,
    in his new book and accompanying audio CD, <em>The Pelt</em>.  But here's the thing: It works, because his
    music is so unique, so questionable in its intention to <em>be</em> music.</p><p>
    His work with Deep Puddle Dynamics, Themselves, and cLOUDDEAD-- as well as his numerous collaborations and
    solo projects-- are all wildly experimental and outré, each in their own individual way, but are united by
    a common thread: Doseone's muttering, baroquely delivered, and remarkably prolix stream-of-consciousness
    verbal calculus, laden with imbricate image systems and intricate internal rhyming schemes.  His song lyrics
    work as poetry because they don't rely on melodies, hooks, choruses or catchphrases for their force; instead,
    they document intellection and association in a gloriously raw form.</p><p>
    The audio CD that accompanies <em>The Pelt</em>, were it bolstered with beats instead of minimal, atmospheric
    embellishments such as ambient tape noise, subtle click-tracks and slight vocal distortions, could easily
    be received as a music CD, rather than a spoken word performance.  As it is, it's well-served by the book,
    (which is really the main draw anyway), in which the words Doseone reads on the CD slither and tumble all
    over its pages.  Beautifully bound for what is essentially a chapbook, <em>The Pelt</em> boasts a bound spine
    and full-color cover in a handsome card stock.  Inside, we find shambling, carefully sculpted poetics that
    take full advantage of their capacity to surprise and startle: No two pages look the same; the text kinetically
    rambles over the available surface area.  Flipping through, one gets the impression that the text from each
    page leaps off and scurries to rearrange on the next, skidding into position just as the page becomes
    visible.</p><p>
    The text is offset by various surreal line drawings, creating a three-way aesthetic interface (text/audio/pictures)
    in which each facet of the triptych deepens the others.  There's even a games page in the back, including
    bizarre versions of the word search, maze, Mad-Lib, and paint-by-numbers puzzles.  For the work's intellectual
    content, Doseone retains his usual methods, most notably that of formal appropriation: He hijacks the
    semantic and structural tics of the automated help-line, the advertisement, the questionnaire, the play,
    the multiple-choice test, the table of contents, and the essay. You'll even find elements of honest-to-God
    Imagist and L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poetry peppering this organic, original and overwhelmingly dense piece of work.
    Doseone has long been raising the bar for experimental hip-hop; here, he does the same for musicians trying
    their hand at verse.</p></div>"|2565.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2565-the-pelt/|7.8|Brian Howe

    bring together his entire roster for a collaborative project that reflects his imprint's commitment to
    progressive electronic music.  When Pole's Stefan Betke asked him to put together an album for Betke's
    own ~scape label, Avanessian jumped at the chance to finally put the record together, and before he knew
    it, he'd enlisted Jimmy Tamborello (mastermind of Dntel, and the music half of The Postal Service) for
    production help, as well as a slew of guest producers and MCs for the project.  The outcome would finally
    be dubbed Headset, and released by Plug Research in North America under exclusive license from ~scape.</p><p>
    
    The results are possibly best introduced by comments made by Avanessian himself: ""This is not a hip-hop
    record, not an electronic record, and definitely not a jazz record, but we're influenced by all of these
    and love to create our own interpretations of these genres... We were listening to a lot of hip-hop over
    the years, and sometimes feel that commercial hip-hop producers bring a lot of new ideas and a fresh
    approach to making music, so yes, this record was influenced by people like The Neptunes, Timbaland, Dr.
    Dre, Kanye West, as well as producers on our label.""</p><p>
    
    Read between the lines, and Avanessian says it himself: Headset's debut, <i>Spacesettings</i>, attempts to
    meet some of the greatest hip-hop beatmakers of the past five years on their own terms, with very little of
    the talent or ear for innovation that made them the most sought-after producers working today.  The result,
    unfortunately, is worse in execution than it reads on paper: <i>Spacesettings</i> is liquidated, hookless,
    and entirely flaccid.  While it's great that Plug Research finally at least <i>sort of</i> respects
    commercial pop music-- that ""sometimes feel..."" bit just kills me-- there's not much more to Headset than
    its repetitive, RZA-regurgitating, Tamborello-does-hip-hop gimmick.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Then Again"" and the unwitting remix track that follows it, ""Back Before"", play into all the bad
    indie hip-hop stereotypes: forgettably minimal low-tech beats, occasional ambient noises, and some anonymous
    kid rapping about Truth.  Save Non-GENETIC's gem, ""But lookit/ You're steppin' like your boxers on crooked,""
    listeners shouldn't expect much from the Headset MCs.  It's great that word gymnast Subtitle has breath
    control-- and mentions it often-- on ""Breath Contrails""; it's just a shame he's so full of shit.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere on <i>Spacesettings</i>, instrumental tracks are consistently too long and lazy.  Daedelus's
    flute-and-piano sound collage ""Outward Sound"" opens interestingly but then goes nowhere; ""Grasping Claw
    (The Beginning)"" is where <i>One Word Extinguisher</i> meets <i>Deadringer</i>, but without the technique
    of the former or the hooks of the latter.  The greatest offender, however, is saved for the penultimate
    track: On ""Previously Smooth Sophistication"", ""smooth"" is the operative word, and ""jazz"" is the missing
    one.</p><p>
    
    Two moments very briefly rescue <i>Spacesettings</i> from total monotony: Lady Dragon's feisty Japanese
    rap on ""Grasping Claw"", and the lush, pretty string parts at the end of the Thomas Fehlmann-enhanced
    closer ""Sound of a Squint"".  Sadly, these two temporary high points are not quite high enough to carry
    the record.  So, at its best, <i>Spacesettings</i> is a forgivable misstep with ambitions its creators
    couldn't hope to live up to; at its worst, it's hip-hop for assholes, another ""enlightened"" set from
    unskilled collegiate MCs whose piety amounts to little more than deep-seated inferiority crises.</p></div>"|3986.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3986-spacesettings/|3.2|Nick Sylvester

(aka Yoni Wolf) and Andrew Broder (aka Ninja Tune
    artist Fog).  If you believe the myth, the partnership arose almost spontaneously during a troglodytic
    retreat over a heady cocktail of Veggie Booty and tofu sandwiches.  Mutual veganism, of course, has begat
    many a hallowed relationship, and in this case, it resulted in a musical collaboration conceived in the
    basement of the now-folkloric Minneapolis record store Hymie's, which is co-owned by Broder's wife.
    Unsurprisingly, the result retains the atmospheric esoterica of cLOUDDEAD and the candid quirkiness of
    Broder's Fog releases, yet also features an interesting and unique interplay.</p><p>
    Unlike many two-man collaborative efforts, ego and testosterone are mostly left out of the equation on
    <i>Hymie's Basement</i>, replaced by misanthropy and self-deprecation.  And while suburban ennui and
    disjointed American ideology sit at the heart of the duo's concerns, there are even yet more introspective
    and emotional facets to their sound.  There's also a lot of almost indecipherable esoterica that ratifies
    their automatic work ethos.  ""Ghost Dream"" kicks off with a monotonous deadpan delivery that recalls Beck
    circa <i>Mellow Gold</i> (think ""Soul Suckin' Jerk"") in its stream-of-consciousness babble, but its killer
    scratch-beats and beautifully frail piano render its unintelligible lyrics poignant and melodious.</p><p>
    Along with ""Pretty Colors (Smile Your Brains Out)"" and ""You Die"", ""21st Century Pop Song"" was recorded
    after the original basement sessions as a means of gathering enough material to fill out the album.  The
    track benefited from a little distance, and both its mood and subject matter make it the perfect opener
    for the record.  Here, the pair merge slick hip-hop production tricks with indie guitar riffing to
    overlapping vocals that tackle ideological cynicism, the futility of mundane existence, and atomic bomb
    survival tactics.  Lines like, ""You put your life in the hands of the highway designers/ Your stride and
    unforeseen side effect/ Of the urban planner's realized blueprint dream,"" express feelings of marginalization
    and impotence.  The song's melodic chorus (""It's root root root for the home team"") ties the awkward verses
    together and shows a strong pop sensibility that continually rears its head over the course of the record.</p><p>
    ""Props to Ornette Coleman/ For trying to castrate himself/ Males of the world you are despicable,"" sings
    Broder over a rolling piano and Wolf's poised harmonies on ""America Too"".  Forming a silly pun partnership
    with ""America Won"", these tracks-- sad and angry, respectively-- depict a perception of the modern American
    male in bitter isolation while echoing the post 9/11 sense of ineffectuality.  Both Wolf and Broder excel
    at offbeat observations that sit happily alongside innovative instrumentals.  The band's official website
    asks us to notice a ""nervous energy"" between the two on their first co-written track, ""All Them Boys"", but
    for me, the whole record reflects a basic unease and trepidation-- between the artists themselves and the
    male gender, which they seem to despise.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, ""The Pump"" is a superior riposte to the baffling contradictions of the human condition, especially
    as it's juxtaposed with the magic of the transient moment.  ""Moonhead"" captures wide-eyed creepiness of a
    Tim Burton short story with the postured, thousand-yard stare feeling of Sigur Rós.  ""Parrots"" starts like
    Leonard Cohen's ""The Future"" set to the bossanova rhythm preset of a thrift-shop keyboard before lurching
    feverishly into a brooding, nightmarish rap.  One of many stylistic departures, ""Ben and Joey"", staggers
    through They Might Be Giants territory.  Although the words sometimes evade total comprehension here, the
    duo's constant revision and development of their sound keeps the album fizzing with originality and
    unsettling charm.</p><p>
    cLOUDDEAD and Fog are hefty legacies to follow, but <i>Hymie's Basement</i> comes up with the goods and
    then some.  The partnership has coaxed the edgier, darker sides of Wolf out to mingle with Broder's naiveté
    and surrealist monologues.  Thematically, the record has a unity that suggests a long-term alliance but the
    vibrant arrangements buzz with the exhilaration of a new relationship.  It leaves you exhausted, fulfilled
    and with plenty to think about-- not least being whether a second Hymie's Basement project could be in the
    pipeline.</p></div>"|3987.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3987-hymies-basement/|8.3|Dan Lett

    Grows!!!</i> is deceptively alluring: Like Keith Moon's bass drum arbitrarily erupting on live national
    television, or Ozzy Osbourne yanking down his pants and whizzing little yellow rivers all over the Alamo,
    there's something vaguely impudent about The Catheters' fuzzed-out guitars, tin can production, yelpy
    vocals, and jolting rhythms-- and all that blind, sloppy audacity can occasionally create something stupidly
    appealing.  Particularly at first listen.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""No Natural Law"" is a hopelessly twitchy introduction, unraveling at every turn, all youthful
    indiscretion and awkwardly squawked proclamations, tangling The Catheters up in their own popping guitar
    strings and beautifully explosive finishes.  Their guitars buzz, the disc quivers, and, 30 seconds in, the
    proposition of flopping face-first into The Catheters' muddy stew is oddly inviting-- much like the ill-fated
    romance of garage-rock itself (see: recording on an $8 tape deck, sandwiched between lawnmowers, sacks of
    fertilizer and half-empty paint cans), it's easy to get swept up in The Catheters' spunky impishness, to
    be inadvertently seduced by something so unapologetically brash and seemingly unconcerned with its own
    tunefulness.  Still: By three tracks in, the band's thick slams start to become numbingly repetitive, the
    songs grow increasingly redundant.  And not much later, it becomes strikingly evident that there's little
    here to discern one cut from the next, and nothing at all to maintain the giddy momentum of its start.</p><p>
    
    Like nearly all fledgling garage bands, The Catheters' mine the ashes of the Stooges and the MC5 (as well
    as nodding to labelmates/contemporaries The Murder City Devils and Mudhoney), and <i>Howling</i> is a spotty
    mishmash of garage kickiness and metal sludge.   Yet, something about the album seems prematurely and
    preemptively tired, and the longer the record plays, their inability to sustain significance becomes
    increasingly obvious.  Despite all the promise of The Catheters' bluster, <i>Howling</i> is startlingly
    benign.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, The Catheters are big on style, and troublingly low on ideas-- most of <i>Howling</i>'s 33
    minutes refries the exact same tired, neo-garage conceits, but without tweaking the components, or
    injecting any compelling or memorable hooks.  The resulting record is sort of like a post-fire apartment:
    layers and layers of wet white fuzz, with nothing much of worth soaking underneath.</p></div>"|1351.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1351-howling-it-grows-and-grows/|6.6|Amanda Petrusich

    whenever things fared well, Matthew Herbert enacted the persona of Doctor Rockit for, appropriately, his
    most quotidian and most personal compositions, the best of which are now collected on the self-deprecating
    <i>The Unnecessary History of Doctor Rockit</i>.</p><p>
    
    On Herbert's Clear Records debut, 1996's <i>Ready to Rockit</i> EP, as well as 1997's <i>The Music of
    Sound</i>, the musique concrete artist adopted what he calls in retrospect his ""diary theme.""  Herbert used
    everyday samples from Doctor Rockit's (the horse) Pyrrhic-only victory to Herbert's own childhood stomping
    grounds to hotels, restaurants and airplanes he encountered on his European tour with Cheap Records.  The
    tracks combined Herbert's tendency towards jazz and the quieter, more electro sound that aligned him so
    well with Clear, whose artistic unwillingness to follow the trend back to club music in the late 1990s
    spelled their demise.</p><p>
    
    At the time of Clear's dissolution, Herbert hooked up with vocalist Dani Siciliano and began recording sleeker
    and ultimately more successful material under Herbert's surname; Doctor Rockit and his ""anything goes"" schtick
    were sidelined until 2000's <i>Indoor Fireworks</i>.  A veritable grab bag, the somewhat unrealized
    <i>Indoor Fireworks</i> is a remarkably honest self-portrait of Herbert.  Straightforward audio-diary
    tracks like ""Metro"", ""Cafe de Flore"", and ""Cath's Machine"" share space with Herbert's political concerns
    on ""Hymnformation"", and even the pre-Herbert, Siciliano-voxed ""Summer Love"", the album's standout track
    (and one that is surprisingly not included on <i>The Unnecessary History</i>).</p><p>
    
    Hindsight may be 20/20, but in a very real way, <i>Indoor Fireworks</i> signaled Doctor Rockit's increasingly
    poor health.  Which is not to say that Herbert is incapable of personal expression outside of the alias; it
    just seems the Herbert project, his musico-personal relationship with Siciliano, and his increasingly
    political edge were the <i>only</i> things worth expressing.  Especially after the acclaimed <i>Around the
    House</i>-- an audio crossroads for Herbert's loves and musical politics-- this comp's title seems right on
    the money.  Which is perhaps why, with <i>The Unnecessary History of Doctor Rockit</i>, Matthew Herbert is
    killing off that moniker.</p><p>
    
    The compilation rescues many deleted and hard-to-find tracks from Doctor Rockit's early Clear days, early
    vinyl-only releases on Herbert's own Life and Lifelike labels, a few tracks from <i>Indoor Fireworks</i>,
    and Doctor Rockit's most recent release, ""Veselka's Diner"".  It's a testament to Herbert how well these
    tracks have aged.  Opener ""Cameras and Rocks"" is from the 1996 <i>Ready to Rockit</i> double 10-inch, yet
    its minimal puddle-synth jungle-shuffle and outlandishly funny synthesizer melody have retained their
    potency, undoubtedly from the high degree of subtlety to which Herbert almost apologetically subjects his
    work.  Also from <i>Ready to Rockit</i> is the slurpy jazz-finding-loops of ""Photos and Pebbles""-- the
    musical mold that birthed ""Cameras and Rocks""-- which invites comparisons to Jan Jelinek.</p><p>
    
    While sometimes musically minimal, the Doctor Rockit project also at times predicted the Matthew Herbert
    Big Band-- the 1996 DR EP <i>Swingtime</i> is likely being referenced in the title to MHBB's 2003 release,
    <i>Goodbye Swingtime</i>.  ""Cafe de Flore"" has found itself on more lounge-style compilation discs than
    possibly any other Herbert song.  Its acoustic brushes-on-snare cocktail jazz-tinged house is buttered up
    by Herbert's tasteful ambient samples and catchy synth and accordion melodies.  Occasionally, Herbert
    ditches the glitch and records his instruments in the nude.  These tracks, such as the piano solo at the
    end of ""I Wish I Was"", are far less interesting than the equal parts jazz-meets-house that Herbert executes
    so seamlessly.  Still, while Herbert is a gifted pianist, he does have a tendency for trite jazz phrases.</p><p>
    
    The compilation fittingly closes with ""Granny Delicious"", which contains Herbert's first-ever ""field
    recording"" sample (the sound of an apple being eaten), yet part of me also wished Herbert closed <i>The
    Unnecessary History</i> with the leftfield accordion drinking song ""This Is The End"", however tongue-in-cheek
    it would have been.</p><p>
    
    Beyond functioning as a disjointed but accurate retelling of Doctor Rockit's story and breadth of styles,
    <i>The Unnecessary History</i> also documents Herbert's apparently deep concern that his music of sound
    is, in fact, still music.  From his lengthy sampling treatise to his recourse to jazz modes to his anxious
    use of live, man-played instruments, Herbert oddly strikes me as never seeming fully convinced of his music's
    worth.  That tension is more apparent on Herbert's Doctor Rockit records than any other point in his career,
    which is perhaps one reason why <i>The Unnecessary History</i> is a compelling tale spun by one of the
    world's most meticulous and exciting artists.</p></div>"|2564.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2564-the-unnecessary-history-of-doctor-rockit/|7.8|Nick Sylvester

Wherever style beats substance, youth is a highly valued and unbearably
    scarce commodity; in rock, and particularly in more traditionally juvenile variations like emo, the hands
    of time are especially cruel.  Bottling and selling precious youth is notoriously fickle; often, bands have
    long outgrown their lissome twenty-something physiques and lost all their oomph by the time they put a
    stamp on the completed package.  And the music?  It's less about conveying the universal reach of emotion
    than about capturing the feelings and incidental naivety of a very specific time.</p><p>
    While we all find ourselves immersed by that glorious pocket of beauty and invincibility at some point,
    its attitude isn't easy to feign, and so, bands that choose not to hang it up after their sophomore release
    are more likely becoming The Promise Rings or The Get-Up Kids of this world than The Flaming Lips or
    Wilcos.  The fate of Minneapolis quartet The Plastic Constellations is still very much in flux.  After
    issuing the stellar <i>We Got the Movement</i> EP in 1999, which copped everyone from Fugazi to Sonic
    Youth in a gruff morass of youthful ingenuity, the group followed with an equally impressive debut
    full-length, <i>Let's War</i>, securing their status as promising post-punk debutantes.</p><p>
    Then came a four-year hiatus, as the group's members done and went got some college.  That's right: The
    Plastic Constellations' prodigious early yield was entirely the work of suburban high-schoolers.  In an
    age rife with quixotic minstrels-- the bohemian equivalent of varsity football stars-- and lead guitarists
    with three-CD vocabularies, The Plastic Constellations were refined beyond their years.  What's more,
    <i>Let's War</i> and <i>We Got the Movement</i> contained the kind of unbridled enthusiasm that usually
    trumps technical prowess, lyrical substance, and songwriting inventiveness in teenagers' judgments of the
    next local emo band.</p><p>
    Alas, if only the patrons of Hopkins, Minnesota's underground music scene knew how lucky they were.
    <i>Mazatlan</i>, the group's emergent comeback, is full of universal qualities, but perhaps most importantly,
    it transports the listener back to the cozy early days of music fandom, when finding a record you loved was
    an episodic event, and one or two songs could occupy an entire afternoon.</p><p>
    The Plastic Constellations aren't merely a strong outfit for their respective niche, but a mature,
    well-coordinated group that show great talent and even greater potential.  The songs on <i>Mazatlan</i>
    resemble something conceptualized in a budding musician's hotwired brain-- virtuosity and communication
    between musicians being, naturally, no object-- but which so rarely get penned for the intensive and
    fleeting nature of the young imagination.  Remarkably, the record is impressively cohesive, despite a
    couple questionable instances of quasi-rapping (""Movement Momentum"", ""Vicious Devotion"") and a feeling
    of persistent breathlessness from the breakneck tempos.</p><p>
<i>Mazatlan</i> runs the gamut of post-punk influences, from elder heroes Sonic Youth and Fugazi to
    latter-day stars like Les Savy Fav and Slint.  But what makes these songs truly intriguing is The Plastic
    Constellations' eager exploration of odd tunings and contrasting, often atonal guitar harmonies.  ""Beats
    Like You Stole Something"" is a deftly multi-tracked example of the band's licks, opening with a twinkling
    riff redolent of <i>Daydream Nation</i>'s broken music box melodies before burgeoning into a full-fledged
    post-punk Armada.  ""Evil Groove"" amply lives up to its title, turning in some craggy unison figures and a
    fragile, arpeggiated bridge section that exemplifies the band's off-kilter approach to post-punk.</p><p>
    Throughout the album, The Plastic Constellations find novel ways to reconcile seemingly incommensurable
    styles and motifs, and their unflagging technique is a constant boon.  Whereas it took Les Savy Fav several
    years to tame their recalcitrant energy and release a coherent album, The Plastic Constellations have
    already got themselves in check.  Even <i>Mazatlan</i>'s most sophomoric tunes avoid monotony and are
    executed without a hitch.  ""East Cleveland"" motors by in a curt 2\xBD minutes, barely taking a breather
    between abrupt section changes, and yet still manages to deliver an anthemic chorus and a soaring bridge.
    In fact, The Plastic Constellations make a valiant effort to resurrect that sadly neglected element of
    effective, sophisticated pop music, bearing a bucketful of robust enjoinders.</p><p>
    As chic as the guitar work and complex song structures may be, though, <i>Mazatlan</i>'s most immediately
    winning quality is its abundance of anthemic choruses.  Even if the band weren't so technically proficient,
    their lapses would be highly forgivable; The Plastic Constellations are easy to rally around, and their
    lyrics often hammer home their preciously of-the-moment aesthetic.  On opener ""We Came to Play"", a febrile
    first verse gives way to the chorus lyric, ""We wrote this/ And laced up our shoes/ We came to play/ It's
    what we do.""</p><p>
    Such exuberance, while often obnoxious in less musically apposite contexts, suffuses
    <i>Mazatlan</i>, providing its relentless lifeblood.  The lyrical onslaught is constant and unwavering,
    thanks to a tasteful array of rhythmic vocal harmonizing, often triple-tracked and never cloying.  Lesser
    bands might spend a decade trying to get to this point, only to find themselves already washed up, but
    The Plastic Constellations make it look easy, and seem ready for more.</p></div>"|6542.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6542-mazatlan/|8.5|Sam Ubl

Comprised of three of four Dedrick siblings
    (Chris, Bruce and Sandy), they specialized in a similar style of folk as peers Peter, Paul &amp; Mary.  However,
    doubtlessly due to main songwriter Chris' classical music studies, their music was decidedly ornate and their
    vocal harmonies precise and complex.  The group quickly recorded a two-song demo-- and just as quickly were
    courted by labels quick to capitalize on the success of other ""harmony groups"" like the Beach Boys and Simon
    &amp; Garfunkel.  The Free Design subsequently found a home with independent easy-listening label Project 3, who
    promised greater creative freedom than the others.  Unfortunately, the group failed to land a hit, likely due
    in part to the label's inexperience promoting pop acts.  Now, nearly 40 years later, Light In the Attic
    Records has reissued the band's first four LPs, revealing a band unfairly slept on.</p><p>
    
    The band's 1967 debut <i>Kites Are Fun</i> placed them squarely in the realm of sunshine pop acts like The
    Association and Curt Boettcher and Gary Usher's Sagittarius, but with the unmistakably precious Greenwich
    Village sound.  Its songs are uniformly well arranged and performed, sparkling with some of the clearest
    sound of the era, and are also consistently pleasant and inoffensive, offering an amiable take on the
    counterculture's message of peace, love and freedom.  The Free Design make no bones about their wholesome
    convictions in the title track: ""We'd like to be a zillion miles away from everyone/ 'Cause Mom and Dad and
    Uncle Bill don't realize <i>Kites Are Fun</i>.""  The intricate vocal lines, using sophisticated harmonies
    normally associated with jazz or chamber classical music, carry out its beyond-innocent charms.  ""The Proper
    Ornaments"" adds in ""ba-ba"" vocal counterpoint reminiscent of the Beach Boys and The Mamas &amp; the Papas, in
    addition to a baroque arrangement featuring harpsichord and trumpets; it's as refined a piece of music as
    was released in the decade, though did the band no favors in hipper circles.</p><p>
    
    The following year, The Free Design released <i>You Could Be Born Again</i>, adding youngest sister Ellen
    to the lineup.  Having another voice allowed Chris to write more complex vocal arrangements, but otherwise,
    the album is very similar to the debut.  It features several covers of current pop hits, including
    ""California Dreamin'"", The Beatles' ""Eleanor Rigby"", The Turtles' ""Happy Together"" and Burt Bacharach's
    ""The Windows of the World""-- and despite the brash dual-trumpet solo attack on the Mamas &amp; the Papas tune,
    these songs contribute to a faceless professionalism that diminishes the album's impact.  Chris Dedrick
    provides the most distinctive music, especially the gorgeous ""Ivy on a Windy Day"".  Opening with a ghostly
    choral section, the song eventually settles into soft pop, featuring an unusual chord sequence that wouldn't
    sound out of place on recent Stereolab records-- in fact, Laetitia Sadier has cited the band as one of her
    all-time favorites.  The reissue appends two non-LP bonus tracks: an easy-listening holiday ballad
    ""Christmas Is the Day"" and the oddly titled ""Close Your Mouth (It's Christmas)"".</p><p><i>Heaven/Earth</i> was released in 1969, and for the most part continues the soft, psychedelic pop of the
    first two records.  ""You Be You and I'll Be Me"" spices up a typically elaborate vocal arrangement with an
    uptempo, percussive rock groove and a horn chart similar to concurrent Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears or Chicago.
    However, the surprisingly cynical ""2002: A Hit Song"" provides the most spark on the record, suggesting that
    The Free Design weren't satisfied with their niche market.  The singers outline a brief formula for a
    chart-topper (directed to the ""teenyboppers""), only to admit in frustration, ""We did all this last time,
    and it did not work.""  Elsewhere, the funky jazz take on George Gershwin's ""Summertime"" offers evidence
    that the band were willing to step out of the mold they'd crafted for themselves.  The reissue includes
    both sides of a solo single by Ellen Dedrick and several tracks featuring the band as backing singers for
    a 1968 LP by future music-mogul Tommy Mottola.</p><p>
    
    1970's <i>Stars/Time/Bubbles/Love</i> was The Free Design's best album to date, and also the first one to
    explore rock and funk with the same gusto as their already well-established brand of soft pop.  ""Bubbles""
    is its best-known song, and for good reason: The aggressive, odd-metered force of bass and drums, supported
    by clavinet and modestly searing electric guitar, propel Chris' ace vocal arrangement into similar territory
    as The Fifth Dimension and The Millennium, but with a crisper, jazzier edge.  ""Butterflies Are Free"" is softer,
    but equally as engaging, due especially to the gloriously regal arrangement of vocals and brass on the
    fade-out.  Best yet is ""That's All, People"", with deceptively dissonant harmonies and an explosive big
    band performance.</p><p>
    
    The Free Design released two more LPs in the early 1970s (<i>Sing for Very Important People</i> and <i>One
    by One</i>) that will hopefully be reissued soon.  Although the band's sound epitomized ""square"" at the
    time, its impact is obvious in the work of modern sophisti-poppers Stereolab, Cornelius, Manitoba, The
    High Llamas and Belle &amp; Sebastian.  They were overlooked the first time around, but The Free Design make
    more sense now than ever.</p></div>"|11746.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11746-kites-are-fun-you-could-be-born-again-heavenearth-starstimebubbleslove/|8.0|Dominique Leone

    of <i>Hamlet</i> or the blood-hungry mass-murders of <i>Macbeth</i> to the trivial shenanigans of lovers
    under a fairy's spell.  <i>Dream</i> was even made into a musical recently-- which thankfully didn't stick--
    but if the concept is ever revisited (and it surely will be: Broadway dudes love churning that stale butter),
    Faun Fables' <i>Family Album</i> would make a suitably awful soundtrack.</p><p>
    
    Faun Fables is the solo project of Dawn McCarthy (aka Dawn the Faun), who has taken the omnipresent folk
    revival of late to a more theatrical level, her joyful yodels and tongue-twisting chants setting the stage
    for absurd characters to frolic in their carefree madness.  <i>Family Album</i> kicks off with ""Eyes of a
    Bird"", whose calm flute intro is shattered by McCarthy's wailing vocals.  As the song progresses, she grows
    increasingly shrill (imagine the timbre of Beth Orton's folky drawl stretched to its claws-on-chalkboard
    extreme) while a second female voice provides distractingly dissonant harmonies.  The song's final few
    minutes disintegrate into tribal grunts and wails, as if Dawn the Faun had gotten a little too near recent
    Animal Collective without grasping the intricacies that make it work.  This transition from calm to chaos
    sets the stage for the play that's about to unfold: Hermia (in love with Lysander) has been promised to
    Demetrius, who has captured the heart of Hermia's best friend, Helena.</p><p>
    
    As the four lovers chase each other into the forest, McCarthy spins her tale into a hypnotic dream with the
    mellow ""Poem 2"" (yes, that <i>is</i> a glockenspiel), moaning, ""Dig the magic from your grave,"" as the Puck
    she envisions spreads Oberon's magic juice on first one lover, then another.  The story deteriorates into
    absolute mayhem as they awaken to find that their world no longer revolves around Hermia, and the two
    dashing lads turn to chase Helena instead.  McCarthy mirrors Hermia's grief in a duet with Sleepytime
    Gorilla Museum's Nils Frykdahl, the song crescendoing into a frenzied shriek as her new reality finally
    sinks in.  Song after song, McCarthy falls into that same trap, never allowing a melody to shine through
    before her vocals overpower it with extreme volume or overwhelming theatrics.  Although she occasionally
    gives the lead to Frykdahl, her piercing attempts at harmonies completely fails to mesh with his almost-goth
    gruffness.</p><p>
    
    The lovers' inverted world can't last forever, and McCarthy coaxes them to sleep with the melodic lullaby
    ""Preview"" (one of the few songs, thankfully, that doesn't end in aggressive wails), sanding off the harsh
    edges of her grating soprano to coo a la-la-lullaby.  Although it's never long before she lapses back into
    shrillness, this song is, I suppose, the best this record has to offer: It's just mellow enough as she
    murmurs perfect fifths over an arpeggiated guitar and autoharp.  Unfortunately, the lulling calm of ""Preview""
    is disrupted by ""Higher"", an adaptation of a traditional hymn that opens with a 30 year-old operatic
    recording of ""Holiest Night"" and deteriorates into a choral sing-along led by Dawn, complete with a
    distorted haunted house-styled organ.  To top it off, after an all-too-serious delivery that's either
    intended to mimic or mock a church choir's lead soloist, McCarthy stretches to hit the final high octave
    note-- just like a real opera singer.  (One should probably ignore the indulgent single applause that
    concludes this track.)</p><p>
    
    From there, the lovers' mayhem is sorted out: The quartet returns to town with the tongue-twisting
    ""Carousel with Madonnas"", and the triple-wedding (Duke Theseus weds Amazon queen Hippolyta) is conducted
    in front of a bonfire to a rhythmic near-rap translation of Brigitte Fontaine's ""Eternal"".  While <i>Family
    Album</i> will never synch up a <i>Midsummer</i> film like the old Floyd/<i>Oz</i> trick, Faun Fables'
    folky theatrics are so histrionic that, whether intentional or not, Dawn the Faun McCarthy has created a
    soundtrack that mirrors the emotional upheavals of those carefree Shakespearean revelers.  And therein
    lies the problem: While the play, like McCarthy's music, captures the hijinx of a drug-influenced summer
    night, there is very little depth beneath the surface, and at its conclusion, the lovers are back where
    they started, no better-- and no worse-- for having made the journey.</p></div>"|3313.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3313-family-album/|3.7|Catherine Lewis

    forms the axis of Kinski's third full-length, you can hear some overenthusiastic audience member shout ""fuck
    yeah!"" amid assorted cheers and applause.  It's not terribly audible, but it's a jarring contrast to the
    diminutive, steadily tolling bell that brings the piece to a near-silent, plaintive close, and it's also
    something of a surprise if you haven't yet scoped the album liners, as it reveals the live setting in which
    the song was recorded.  The track certainly sounds studio-crafted, with its layers of guitar effects, flute,
    oscillator and juno synth, but more to the point, it just doesn't sound like something a band in their right
    mind would play to an audience-- it's slowly unfolding head music, even as it reaches its bizarre climax
    with heavily processed vocal whooping and guitars that sound like they're being hurled from balconies.</p><p>
    
    Even stranger, the recording was made at a September 2002 show that didn't even feature Kinski on the bill--
    Kinski's frontline of bassist Lucy Atkinson and guitarists Chris Martin and Matthew Reid-Schwartz were
    moonlighting that night as Herzog, and in fact, all of the recordings on this album were made under that
    name.  Why release it as a Kinski album, then?  Well, why not?  Kinski's discography was wanting for a bit
    of variety, as the sound they shaped so nicely on their debut album was already going a bit stale by their
    sophomore outing, and this certainly fits that bill with its focus on percussionless drift and sound
    sculpture.</p><p>
    
    By and large, the band works well in this context, but the first two pieces on the album absolutely dominate
    the last three, making them feel essentially superfluous.  ""Never Compete with Small Girls"" is a soft guitar
    drone that shrinks from the daylight, while the aforementioned ""Misprint"" is unquestionably the band's most
    substantial piece to date, and not just for its breadth.  Over the song's half-hour span, the band meditates
    on dread and apprehension, rising gradually through tense half-melodies (check the subtle references to ""The
    Little Drummer Boy"" at around 14:45) to the final freakout.  There are unmistakable shades of everything
    from Can, Klaus Schulze and early Pink Floyd to Mogwai, and pretty much anything ever released on Kranky.</p><p>
    
    It may not be fair to describe them as such on their own accounts, but the remaining three compositions feel
    like afterthoughts coming in the wake of all that.  I've tried listening to the three of them on their own,
    away from their bigger brothers' shadows, but it only makes them feel incomplete, and even more like sketches
    for something larger.  ""Bulky Knit Cheerleader Sweater"", in particular, is little more than a jumble of
    politely churning noises, with little-to-no contour.  These late letdowns do little to blunt the overall
    impact of the album's centerpiece, though, and given that they constitute far less than half of the runtime,
    it's easy to overlook their shapelessness and focus on the good stuff upfront.</p></div>"|4463.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4463-dont-climb-on-and-take-the-holy-water/|7.2|Joe Tangari

    same way the Drive-By Truckers view Lynyrd Skynyrd: as a specifically regional influence.  For brothers
    and band mainstays Dave and Serge Bielanko, The Boss-- with his word-dense songs, layered sound, and
    romantic conviction in rock 'n' roll's redemptive powers-- is just as much a Mid-Atlantic birthright as
    the Van Zant brothers are to Southerners like Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley.</p><p>
    
    While the Truckers, however, have received mostly praise for their double album about Skynyrd's career,
    Marah have received mostly jibes and pans for their E Street obsession.  For one thing, Springsteen is
    still alive and touring, thus defying easy mythologizing, and he is generally thought of less as a
    Mid-Atlantic artist and more as simply an American one.  Furthermore, having no Faulkner nor Delta blues,
    the Mid-Atlantic region-- the eastern Pennsylvania wasteland, most of New Jersey, all of clotted Delaware,
    parts of Maryland, and, some claim, a few acres in West Virginia-- is neither as defined in the public
    conscience nor as storied as the South, despite its very particular history and culture.</p><p>
    
    Under the crushing weight of critical and commercial apathy (their first two albums should have been
    classics), Marah left the Mid-Atlantic altogether and recorded their ill-fated third album, <i>Float Away
    with the Friday Night Gods</i>, with Oasis producer Owen Morris, who turned their timeless urban rock into
    the kind of anthemic electro-sludge that was already out of date by 1995.  Still, it was never as bad as
    its detractors (most of whom were former fans) claimed, with Dave's songwriting-- especially on ""Crying on
    an Airplane""-- softening the winces.  Plus, there's always the possibility of a future live album to salvage
    those tracks.</p><p>
    
    If <i>Float Away</i> proved anything, it was what the Bielanko brothers set out expressly to disprove: You
    can take the kids out of Philly, but you can't take Philly out of the kids.  For their fourth album, <i>20,000
    Streets Under the Sky</i>, Marah return to their southside garage studio, not just as a recording site but
    as a setting for their gritty urban narratives.  They're scarred but smarter (to quote another Skynyrd-inspired
    southern rock band, Drivin' N' Cryin'), knowing what works and still trying not to be tied to it.  One song,
    ""Goin' Through the Motions"", even hints at what <i>Float Away</i> could have been had they produced <i>Float
    Away</i> on this side of the Atlantic.</p><p>
    
    The lead-off track, ""East"", therefore, could be a kiss-off to fickle fans who cried sell-out when the band
    caught that transatlantic flight: ""East is all I need to finally start to feel defined.""  Even as it yearns
    for points beyond the Delaware Bay (New Jersey?  Ireland?), the song is anchored specifically in Philadelphia,
    as Dave describes the rumble of cars on I-95 and the jumble of people on South Street.  Likewise, the entire
    album absorbs Philadelphiana like a sponge: car alarms and cat calls sound between songs, an errant trumpet
    introducing one track.  The monumental ""Freedom Park"" even sets its tale of big-city bleakness against local
    girls chanting jump-rope jingles, transforming their sing-song rhythms into a lively gospel chorus.</p><p>
    
    Marah's sound is fondly local, incorporating doo-wop, Philly soul, funk, and ambitious Springsteenisms (all
    those bells and saxes) in a restless depiction of the city as a place where neighborhoods are still defined
    and demarcated ethnically, and Dave writes songs to match.  ""Feather Boa"" is a standout, a tale of a
    hard-luck transvestite who fears violence and death around every corner.  It's a frank depiction of trying
    to pass, with some of Dave's best street poetry: ""Scratch card rub off silver/ Is the jewel beneath his nails/
    His skin is bar room shark fin/ His lashes are sardine tails.""  On the chorus he sings, ""This dick between
    my legs just makes me cry,"" giving the words the gutpunch impact of the last line of ""Round Eye Blues"".</p><p>
    
    And if the second half of <i>20,000 Streets</i> emphasizes Dave's threadbare vocals in overreaching anthems
    like ""Soda"", Marah at least bolster them with imaginative accompaniment.  Granted, ""Pizzeria"" would probably
    sound better with Dave singing instead of Serge, but then again, his clearly affectionate vocals, while a
    bit thin in his overenunciation, at least preserve the album's casual vibe, as if performing these songs in
    some dingy Philly club for a few friends and family.  <i>20,000 Streets</i> isn't a comeback-- it's a
    homecoming.</p></div>"|5102.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5102-20000-streets-under-the-sky/|7.5|Stephen M. Deusner

    to the realm of unparalleled genius?  Hard to quantify, even for the most mathematical at heart, but you know
    it when you hear it.  Certain elements must be accounted for-- most importantly, an emotional ballast is
    essential to keep any twangy wigouts from veering into self-indulgent, alienating miasmic slop.  In hip-hop--
    a genre defined primarily by its rigid rhythmic orientation-- the channels of experimentation are actually
    a bit more open, though maybe somewhat more predictable.  That is, fuck with rhythm and you're fucking with
    the foundation of hip-hop.  But inject that aforementioned depth of emotion into a shattered and rebuilt
    rhythmic template, and you might arrive at something vital.</p><p>
    Food for Animals step up to the plate and mostly obliterate the rhythmic conventions we've come to expect
    from hip-hop.  This isn't skittering, hiccuped eski beat or minimalist schiz-hop pong hits; what remains
    after DJ/producer Ricky Rabbit goes Rick James all over his ProTools setup sounds like a field recording
    from a sheet metal factory getting flattened by a herd of bulldozers.  In fact, it isn't until two minutes
    into this 20-minute sound test that any semblance of a beat settles for MC Vulture Voltaire to rap over.
    But once he rolls through Rabbit's swarm of killer beats with a brassy, heavyweight tone, the gravity is
    difficult to ignore.</p><p>
    Don't be misled: You have to be in the mood for this sometimes withering assault.  When Voltaire comes in
    over the twisted strings and stuttering drums of ""Brand New"", all semblance of dance floor contrivance and
    headphone filler are laid to waste.  Rock <i>Scavengers</i> while flipping through <i>Vice</i> in the
    waiting room of your local body piercing shop with Jim Beam and bad powder on hand as your only anesthetic.</p><p>
    After several early tunes are burnt up with Rabbit's short jagged percussion stabs and Voltaire's soulful,
    low-in-the-mix rage, the final 12 minutes show the blood-quickening power this duo is capable of.  The whole
    album is a rant against Bush's stolen presidency, but ""Cut and Paste"" and the title track are especially
    sweltering with Voltaire's pointed lyrical barbs.  His voice, bristling with clipped urgency, is clear,
    aggressive and angry, yet possessed with the self-aware humor of the most articulate political MCs.  It's
    the anchor that pulls the ear down through Rabbit's torrential beat smashing and the means by which Food
    for Animals manages to strike a teetering balance of chaos and focus that prods a second listen.  By the
    time the instrumental ""TTFN"" closes the album, you've probably been suckered into the band's abrasive,
    unlikely funk.</p><p>
    I can't imagine too many hip-hop heads cranking <i>Scavengers</i> this summer, but grizzled fans of dark
    art-hop like Kid 606 and Dälek will likely grit their teeth in a joyful agony as <i>Food for Animals</i>
    blasts into some well-muscled noise.  Recommended only for those with a high tolerance for serial grime
    and a taste for the sharper, harder edge of hip-hop.</p></div>"|3300.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3300-scavengers-ep/|7.0|Jonathan Zwickel

No worries,
    though.  I imagine this fanbase is a patient lot.  To enjoy Labradford you have to be willing to sit still,
    listen deeply, enjoy the moment, and wait for subtle changes that wind up being quite meaningful when
    stacked one atop the other.</p><p>
    
    Labradford's Mark Nelson, who records as Pan American, has kept busy with music since 2001's excellent
    <i>fixed:content</i>.  His third solo album, <i>The River Made No Sound</i>, was released in 2002, and
    he now returns with a record whose title merits a nomination in the 2004 Truth in Advertising award:
    <i>Quiet City</i>.  While the first three records moved progressively toward beats, loops, and laptop-forged
    glitches, <i>Quiet City</i> sounds very much like where we last left Labradford.  Gone are the dub processes
    and dabbles in microscopic dance music.  There is hardly a loop on the record, there's all sort of guitar,
    and Nelson has recruited players to assist on upright bass (Charles Kim), drums (Steven Hess) and horns
    (David Max Crawford).  Where <i>The River Made No Sound</i> was often cold and brittle, <i>Quiet City</i>
    is like a warm breeze crawling in through an open window.</p><p>
    
    An overall shift in sound toward more trad-instrument territory is evident, but a select few tracks on
    <i>Quiet City</i> are reminiscent of Pan American of old.  The nine-minute ""Wing"" is a heavily electronic
    drone piece, with an unsteady wavering tone surrounded by glitches and static and the occasional presence
    of noisily recorded conga drums.  ""Shining Book"" adds unintelligible whispers by Nelson to the moody ambient
    electronic stew.  These less specific drift pieces blend easily with the more fleshed-out and layered tracks,
    but the most intense moments of <i>Quiet City</i> are direct in the manner of great film music.  ""Het Volk"",
    for example, is like a prime cut from John Barry's <i>Body Heat</i> score, as a tense repeating keyboard
    pattern combines with Crawford's flugelhorn to suggest sweat, darkness, contemplation, and a hint of danger.
    ""Inside Elevation"", with its acoustic guitar and melodica floating above a buried rumble of bass drone,
    captures the veiled desert drama of Paris, Texas.</p><p>
    
    The economical guitar work throughout the record is excellent, and ultimately is at the core of what makes
    <i>Quiet City</i> such an evocative record.  Both ""Skylight"" and ""Lights on the Water"" are built around
    the kind of gorgeously reverberating guitar that Nelson long ago mastered, with the guitar/amp interface
    tweaked to noir perfection.  ""Lights of Little Towns"" closes the album on an up note, with simple plucked
    acoustic guitar dueling with a processed electric and a bowed cymbal to produce a mood of muted optimism
    laced with dignity, something like a more orderly and precise dirge by the Tren Brothers.  Thus ends a
    deceptively powerful album that sounds <em>so good</em> in the background that it's easy to overlook how
    well it's executed.  With any luck, Labradford will return to the studio soon, but in the interim <i>Quiet
    City</i> is plenty to hold us over.</p></div>"|6133.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6133-quiet-city/|8.0|Mark Richardson

The feelings that
    remain vital are unpredictable free radicals; they come out in couplets of both Japanese and English,
    glomming onto the spiny keels and shimmering dream-pop textures that wash over Asobi Seksu's self-titled
    Friendly Fire debut.  The usual suspects crackle through Seksu in big honking waves, but there are also
    little moments of light-- whether in the varied arrangements or Yuki's bilingual lead vocals-- that
    stipple the set with unique enough sunspots.</p><p>
    
    The record's a promising start for the New York City group, which finds the beguiling, keyboard-playing
    Yuki joined by three white guys straight outta indie rock central casting.  ""I'm Happy But You Don't Like
    Me"" rocks cutesy Puffy Amiyumi phrasing over hooting synths and James Hanna's thousand foot-high rhythm
    guitar.  It's a breezy, slightly kitschy opener, but before long, Asobi Seksu are dwelling in suspended
    emotion and the cathartic salve of deafening electric guitar.  ""Sooner""'s English-language harmony vocals
    murmur intimately in lovers' whisper-speak, periodically conceding to Hanna, who attempts to re-harness the
    power of Medicine to shear off the top of the universe.  It's a dynamic familiar to denizens of shoegaze
    (not to mention Sonic Youth-- check Hanna's quite referential ""Let Them Wait""), but Asobi Seksu largely
    gets away with copping it, since the cred gatekeepers will admit that the tones are achingly cool, and at
    a nice counterpoint to Yuki's pattering keys and pristine vocal chirp.</p><p>
    
    Seksu save their best for the middle.  ""It's Too Late"" begins as an echoing, halting ballad, like background
    music for a slow-motion airport terminal goodbye.  Yuki channels the breathy cynicism of Bettie Serveert's
    Carol Van Dijk (""Run away now, there's nothing to say"") and you feel the anger behind the sobs.  Naturally,
    there's punctuation, via layers of piercing guitar wail.  The racket subsides for a spell, but like the
    rawest emotions they come back, screaming and hissing through two-plus minutes of electronic and pedal-driven
    squelch.  It's the album's truest point because it's evocative in its own skin.</p><p>
    
    Asobi Seksu do need some work with the glue.  Uniting their slickest chimes and peals are a few under-thought
    numbers ranging from the saw-it-coming department (the lilting to roaring closer ""Before We Fall""), to frustrating
    stuff that ends too soon (the grinding ""Asobi Masho"" is a randy, art-battered tease).  That said, it's a
    quality debut, obviously indebted to its influences, but finding new and artful ways to swallow love with
    a guitar.</p></div>"|447.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/447-asobi-seksu/|6.0|Johnny Loftus

    EP from Saskatchewan-based four-piece Despistado.  Through 20 minutes of pure post-punk glory, <i>Emergency
    Response</i> rants and throbs with an upbeat intensity that never grates or wanes-- which is a real surprise
    given the unevenness of their label's current roster.  But it is truth: With Despistado, Jade Tree
    has tapped a young and frothy vein of soulful, ramshackle grit that bubbles up sharp and sweet.</p><p>
    
    Despistado's hyperactive, unpredictable song structures might elicit eager Wire comparisons, which would
    be apt but a little farfetched considering the band's freshman status, and the fact that they're proudly
    Canadian.  They've been around the block, though, honing their chops over more than two years of touring
    the Great White North before laying down these densely composed tracks.  Which, as it so happens, has apparently
    been just long enough for the band to develop a keen, commanding personality, and to cultivate a sheepish,
    yearning sincerity that renders these songs instantly likeable.</p><p>
    
    Nearly lost amidst the trebly crossfire of dueling guitars and splashy cymbal work, Dagan Harding's lyrics
    are poetic, suggestive, and intriguingly baffling.  After a jumpy, tourettes-inflected opening, ""A Stirstick
    Prediction"" bounces through several fist-pumping anthemic ticks, while Harding sings, ""There's no otherwise
    inside this black and white/ Get your protractors out/ Round the right angles of your life.""  When Harding
    and bassist Joel Passmore go toe-to-toe on vocals, shout-chanting above Passmore's agile, fluttering basslines,
    and Brennan Schwartz's snare and ride rain down in sheets, the result is too jubilant to sit still to.</p><p>
    
    The irksomely titled ""Can I Please Have an Order of Girl with a Side of Confused"" and rhythmically focused
    ""Bubbles"" both rage with the kind of sincere anti-angst that only kids singing full-throat over lanky guitar
    and tribal beats can muster.  On the two-toned skank of ""Lipstick"", Harding and Leif Thorseth's interlocked
    guitars jingle and jangle over dapper handclaps and jerky drums, while the damnably infectious chorus bores
    into the subconscious.  I think I've listened into this song more than 20 times in three days and fuck if
    its hepcat luster hasn't dimmed.  Indeed, even as Despistado guitar-check their post-punk influences, they
    race into their own identity with a shit-eating grin, arriving at a sound that's all force, no bullshit.</p></div>"|2562.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2562-the-emergency-response-ep/|7.9|Jonathan Zwickel

After two hours and 13 bottles of Stella Artois, I had placed myself into
    an awkward situation.  On top of a table, my first thought was ""jump like Rod Strickland"" but eventually I
    created a comedic rap about Canadian politics.  Although I managed to rhyme ""go Paul Martin"" with ""no hard
    coughing,"" the crowd was thoroughly disenchanted by my performance.  This goes to show just how difficult
    it is to achieve simultaneous success as a humorist and a rapper-- on his debut, <i>Original Rudebwoy</i>,
    Mighty Casey succeeds in the former.</p><p>
    
    Boston rappers have a strong history of being either painfully technical (Esoteric, Mr. Lif) or incredibly
    rudimentary (Guru), and Mighty Casey falls squarely into the second camp.  He has an old-school style with
    a simple nature that lends itself well to party rap.  His delivery sounds labored at times but in some
    instances, his hurried, measured lyrical displays seem charming.  Lyrically, Casey makes up for his lack
    of technical ability with a hilarious personality.  For instance, on ""White Girls"" (loosely based on the
    Grandmaster Flash classic ""White Lines"", and the theme song to the new Wayans Brothers movie <i>White
    Chicks</i>), he claims, ""Used to like Mariah 'til I learned she was mixed"", while ""Black Rapping School""
    features a repetitive bridge that sarcastically intones, ""I sell crack!""</p><p>
    
    Although ""White Girls"" is the song that made Casey's rep on the <i>BET Uncut</i> circuit, the album standout
    comes with ""Liquorland Part 2"".  The concept is a wordplay clinic in the tradition of GZA's ""Labels"", where
    Casey invokes the names of various alcohols and corporations in creative ways.  Over the span of the song,
    he gets political (""I bought a 100 shots, took 59 to swallow/ Poured out 41 for Amadou Diallo""), details
    his favorite measurements (""I like girls thick like Guinness with big cans like Foster's"") and exhibits
    patriotism (""If I stop drinking then the terrorists win"").  Coupled up with a beat whose playful piano loop
    comes courtesy of The Cure's ""The Lovecats"", this track offers Casey's most competent vocal performance,
    and is untouched elsewhere on <i>Original Rudebwoy</i>.</p><p>
    
    The tone of the production-- a dependence on traditional boom-bap in the style of DJ Premier-- is consistent
    throughout the album.  Standouts include the reggae horn dub-splash of ""Black Rapping School"", the chopped
    chimes and trumpet of ""Original Rudebwoy"" and the slo-mo vocal sample and chopstick piano of ""One Night
    Stand"". Although Casey would sound incredible over the more technical production of J-Zone or The Beatnuts,
    the beats he has now are solid enough for his purpose.</p><p>
    
    To get a sense on the kind of artist Mighty Casey is, the press kit comes with a fact sheet detailing his
    cultivation of a pencil moustache and a Mighty Casey coloring page contest.  Obviously, he doesn't take
    music too seriously.  Still, the failings of his debut are apparent: The album is too short (there are only
    nine original songs), its choruses are often incredibly, brutally off-key, and Casey's awkward delivery is
    sometimes distracting.  That said, if you're looking for a good time short of getting up on a table, maybe
    Mighty Casey is for you.</p></div>"|5592.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5592-original-rudebwoy/|6.2|Rollie Pemberton

    Resolution</i> EP is as subtle as it is brittle, and as gracefully measured as anything the duo has
    released to date.  Taken from last year's <i>Hold on Love</i>, ""New Resolution"" was that album's sultry
    stink-eye.  It never explains why hearts are racing and records are skipping, but its insistent, glitchy
    tumble and husky, lingering vocals don't require logic for their simplistic beauty-- especially not with
    the song's sentiment wrapped in the shadows of keening strings and the splotchy bump of Eric Bachmann's
    production.</p><p>
    
    Appropriately, the song's video, included on this disc, skirts the issue while skewering it peripherally.
    Here, we find Orenda Fink and Maria Taylor strolling in their slips on the cracked yellow pavement of a
    Nebraska high noon, holding hands.  Suddenly, there rises an army of the mod.  The slick-suited and
    rearview-mirrored roll their Vespas in formation toward the Azure Ray nexus.  They circle; Fink and Taylor
    parry.  The phalanx splits and reforms, yet it's clear who wears the pants in this dance, and Azure Ray
    end up leading the fancy gang back into town.  This is what they do, these two.  Their music is halting,
    like each breath expelled is at a premium.  But it's also fiercely confident and cocksure: Arrangements
    tearing swatches from southern gothic, shadowy electronica and achy bedroom indie are all stitched
    perfectly.</p><p>
    
    The second track, ""Drinks We Drank Last Night"", appears in gentle home-recorded form, and couldn't be
    further from the corrupted Dido/Lamb mashup of ""New Resolution"".  But naturally, it's just as powerful.
    The harmonies coalesce like dandelion dust, fragile stems rooted in spidery electric guitar and cresting
    electronics.  And if this isn't enough saleable content for those matching Prada with yard sale tutus,
    <i>New Resolution</i> concludes with a remix of its title track by Dntel mastermind and Postal Service
    principal Jimmy Tamborello.  As it turns out, he's up to the task, tweaking and accelerating the track's
    mechanistic bottom end to elongate the linger in Fink and Taylor's phrasing.  His synth-pop drop-ins
    conjure images of animated Norwegians crashing into real life hallways, like ad music for cars not yet
    invented.</p></div>"|402.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/402-new-resolution-ep/|7.5|Johnny Loftus

    the lead axe-man had experienced quite enough of Blur's frivolous, occasionally groundbreaking genre-hopping
    and cause celebre sophistry.  <i>Happiness in Magazines</i> emphatically dispels any remaining speculation,
    proving Coxon as stubbornly fond of American-style power-pop as his former band seemed to be before they
    cozied up to the commodious confines of international stardom.  As it happens, Coxon's solo releases have
    proven him not only the most prolific member of Blur, but also the least adventurous.  Fortunately, with
    <i>Happiness in Magazines</i>, his by-the-numbers approach to songcraft has finally yielded its most
    copious rewards.</p><p>
    Exploring the vacated ghosts of stale forms, Coxon has breathed new life into some of rock's most bankable
    clichés.  Throughout its 12 tracks, <i>Happiness in Magazines</i> shudders to deviate far from its core
    triptych of guitar, bass and drums.  Only during the radio-ready ballad ""All Over Me"" is the textural
    stasis broken by the presence of strings and a sporadic synth arpeggio-- so it's a good thing that Coxon's
    dexterous, liberally multi-tracked guitar playing is diffuse and virtuosic enough to maintain interest.
    On the structurally staid blues riffing of ""Girl Done Gone"", his humid, fuzzed-out playing compensates for
    an uninspired vocal performance, while slyly contradicting the minimalist approach to blues-rock favored
    by bands like The White Stripes or The Black Keys.  In fact, <i>Happiness in Magazines</i> is a record full
    of contradictions.  Sidestepping the mainstream by dint of utter familiarity, Coxon has found a harmonious
    paradox.</p><p>
    Of course, there are dry spots.  ""Hopeless Friend"" shamelessly quotes The Who's ""A Quick One (While He's
    Away)"" verbatim, a technique favored in jazz, but an awkward fit in rock for the form's historical irreverence.
    Elsewhere, the bullhorn-belted vocals and irascible post-punk of ""People of the Earth"" recall The Fall, yet
    the song ultimately falls flat, feeling like a haggard anachronism.</p><p>
    Still, in an era where revivalists are often pitifully short on ideas, frontloading records to the point of
    redundancy, Coxon has managed a seemingly obsolete feat: a blockbuster middle section.  From the opening
    guitar peals of ""Girl Done Gone"" through the readily anthemic chorus of ""Freakin' Out"", <i>Happiness in
    Magazines</i> loses nary a step, turning in a handful of candidates for Rock Single of the Year.  ""Bittersweet
    Bundle of Misery"", replete with blithe acoustic strumming, rudimentary vocal harmonizing, and two-step
    bassline, is one of the most charmingly ironic love songs to grace record this year-- even if it does
    bear a remarkable similarity to Blur's Coxon-penned ""Coffee and TV"".  ""Freakin' Out"" spins an unduly filched
    riff and a paltry lyrical cadence into an indulgent nugget of pop bliss.  But the pinnacle is clearly ""All
    Over Me"", the album's most visceral song and its best stab at constructing something wholly new from
    entirely recycled parts.</p><p>
    As Picasso said, ""Bad artists copy. Good artists steal."" It's obvious that Graham Coxon follows no beat
    but that of his own drummer. And if that means brazenly copping riffs from rock's rapidly mummifying
    origins, so be it: <i>Happiness in Magazines</i>, while spotty, maintains balance on rocky ground,
    acknowledging history while firmly establishing itself in the present.</p></div>"|1645.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1645-happiness-in-magazines/|7.5|Sam Ubl

    two-year exile away from the home city I share with the band.  While the rock-crit throngs lined up to
    praise the album's experimentalism, screw-the-Record-Company-Man martyrdom and accidental 9/11 relevance,
    it merely seemed to me like a postcard photograph that perfectly sums up all the things you love about a
    city, a sonic map of Chicago's every contour.  Putting <i>YHF</i> on the stereo was all it took to cue up
    a mental slideshow of the city's palette: ""Reservations"" the gray tones of a frozen-over Lake Michigan,
    ""Heavy Metal Drummer"" the humid orange of a Grant Park festival, and ""Radio Cure"" the brown shade of
    El-track alleys.</p><p>
    
    It's very possible, then, that the underwhelming feeling projected by <i>A Ghost Is Born</i> is linked to
    my address being restored to a Chicago zip code, where I have the city's essence accessible right outside
    my courtyard gate.  Early returns on the album veer wildly from rapturous proclamations that this record
    solidifies the band's genius to cred-snipers who see it as a crippling failure.  To me, it sounds like
    neither extreme, but rather like a band in need of a break, a band that's been reading their press, a
    band straying too far from their strengths, and a band that's still too good to let any of these things
    completely obscure their talents.</p><p>
    
    A lot of those assumptions are based on the simple fact that <i>A Ghost Is Born</i> is a wildly uneven
    album, fluctuating in both mood and quality over the course of its one hour runtime.  Less cohesive than
    any other Wilco release, <i>Ghost</i> fulfills all the stereotypes of the album-after-the-breakthrough:
    So you've played the band reinvention card, what next?  On some songs, the band take refuge in their past
    incarnations (""I'm a Wheel"", ""Hummingbird""), on some they dip their toe in the water of other bands' pools
    (""Spiders/Kidsmoke""), and on others they take the previous album's achievements to uncomfortable extremes
    (""Less Than You Think"").</p><p>
    
    But more than anything, Jeff Tweedy confirms the fear I've held since I was exposed to most of this new
    material last year during Wilco's tour-closing show: He now revels in extended guitar solos.  Five of
    <i>Ghost</i>'s first six songs dissolve into noisy fretboard fingerings, and it's no coincidence that this
    first half of the album is where most of the weaknesses lie.  As a Neil Young fan, I'm no anti-soloist,
    but for an artist as lyrically and vocally gifted as Tweedy to resort to expressing emotions through
    age-old bombast and pyrotechnics, something must be gumming up the songwriting works.</p><p>
    
    Three of these shut-up-and-play guitar sections come in songs so sleepy and hazy (""At Least That's What
    You Said"", ""Muzzle of Bees"", ""Hell Is Chrome"") that they practically invite idle speculation about Tweedy's
    prehab pill regimen.  Sluggish and flat, they're the opposite of the idea-packed <i>YHF</i> material, with
    the affected quirks that fill out the arrangements unable to dispel the overall grogginess.</p><p>
    
    ""Spiders/Kidsmoke"", on the other hand, dabbles in a marathon Krautrock vamp, spoiling one of Wilco's best
    new songs with a cyclical arrangement that erases the tension and release of its live arrangement. Where
    ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart"" spent its lengthy runtime constantly shapeshifting, ""Spiders/Kidsmoke""
    seems to content to simply spins its wheels for upwards of 10 minutes.</p><p>
    
    Only ""Hummingbird"" manages to cut through Side A's gloom, revisiting the Beatles-pop of <i>Summerteeth</i>,
    albeit without that album's hyperactive keyboards.  Many of <i>A Ghost Is Born</i>'s brighter spots seem
    to be spin-offs of <i>Summerteeth</i>""s classic rock obsession rather than blippy <i>YHF</i> explorations--
    despite this being Wilco's first release since the departure of canon-worship keyboardist Jay Bennett.
    Remaining within the safe confines of their more traditional influences, the piano-strut of ""Theologians""
    echoes the white-soul of The Band (Wilco's closest ancestral analogue), while the slapdash ""I'm a Wheel""
    is an encore-ready reminder of the group's early, 'Mats-evoking days.</p><p>
    
    There are only two songs on <i>A Ghost Is Born</i> that supercede Wilco's influences and arrangement
    struggles, moments when studio texture and songwriting merge smoothly to represent the album's grey mood
    in a way that's genuinely moving rather than disappointingly motionless.  Whereas the ambient storm that
    drifts over the entire album can be distracting, on ""Wishful Thinking"" it creates just the right overcast
    backdrop, guiding Tweedy's softly cracking voice as he combs through feedback blankets looking for love's
    tunnel-end light.  Grandiose yet mellow, ""Company in My Back"" makes the best use of Wilco's current
    keyboard-heavy lineup as piano and Casio verse-color exploding into dulcimer cacophony on the chorus.</p><p>
    
    Nevertheless, <i>A Ghost Is Born</i> squanders its second-half capital in the final reel, whipping up an
    impenetrable, unnecessary 10-minute noise squall to conclude the thin-ice beauty of ""Less Than You Think"".
    In interviews, Tweedy has explained the segment as a aural replica of the migraines that propelled him
    towards pharmaceuticals, but even the deepest empathy won't prevent its unrewarding drone from propelling
    listeners towards the ""&gt;&gt;"" button.  Hit it, and you're treated to the forgettable ""Late Greats"",
    rock-by-numbers with lyrics that unfortunately seem to indicate Tweedy's complaisance with the obscurity
    = good, radio = bad logic of his loudest booster-critics.</p><p>
    
    In the end, the ambitious misfires and pre-coffee drowsiness of <i>A Ghost Is Born</i> don't ruin the
    album entirely-- they only serve as distractions that make it much more difficult to excavate the band's
    strengths from the surrounding detritus.  Certain islands of success continue to give me that feeling of
    purified Chicagoness, even as I spend my days commuting through the actual city.  Should my daily
    premonition of the CTA's silver snake surging off its elevated track come true, I can't think of a
    more fitting score for my mass transit demise than ""Company in My Back"".  But it pains me to see Wilco
    celebrate this album by getting right back on the tour bus, outfitted with a new guitar-army lineup, and
    spending yet more time away from the city from whence they derive their power.  Won't you come home (and
    stay home), Jeff Tweedy?</p></div>"|8680.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8680-a-ghost-is-born/|6.6|Rob Mitchum

Rock operates on an intuitive, not intellectual, level-- it
    drives a shunt into your cerebral cortex, short-circuiting critical thinking, cogent analysis, and good
    judgment. Case in point: I am generally a rational person, and could tick off many a reason why dashing
    my body against a rock club's begrimed floor isn't a good idea.  Yet, whenever some haircut gets on stage
    and starts just ripping it, my health concerns fly out the window and I'm transformed into something off a
    freak-show handbill: ""He writhes! He raves! He crawls on his belly like a snake!"" Rock creates a mental
    bypass via which its primitive, bodily allure goes screaming through the viscera, circumventing the anal
    little bean counters in the florescent-lit cubicles of the brain.  Overblown concepts often, at best,
    distract, and at worst, annoy.</p><p>
    
    The Apes know from concept records: The <em>Tapestry Mastery</em> EP is their fourth.  They've devised a
    handy trick for avoiding the sense of missed-points and intellectual pretension that can plague concept
    albums: They make sure their conceit is <em>completely fucking inscrutable</em>, too loose and arcane to
    muck up an immediate and quite righteous Rock Experience with untoward contemplation.  The result is
    felicitous: The concept remains too oblique to impinge on the exigencies of the music, yet provide it
    with a sort of endoskeleton, a subliminal structure that occurs to the listener not as a set of ordered
    facts, but as a lingering impression of internal unity.</p><p>
<em>Tapestry Mastery</em> revolves around the blind weaver Maximilla, who, in the introductory skit, is
    ordered by The Apes to ""focus your grotesquely developed sense of hearing on the following tales and
    capture them on your loom.  You have twenty days and twenty nights.  Get to it, fool.""  So, wait, what
    tales?  Are we to infer that Maximilla created the subsequent songs from tales we should assume were on
    the rest of the tape, or are the songs the tales that Maximilla must spin?  And who the hell is she,
    anyway?  If the concept is elucidated throughout the album, you'd never be able to tell through the
    layers of distortion slathered on the vocals.  It seems as if it's more for The Apes' benefit than the
    listener's, but doesn't get in the way, and if it's an apparatus they require to write good songs, then
    I have no complaints. </p><p>
    
    One has to admire The Apes for their consistency, having changed little over the course of their career.
    If there's been any perceptible evolution, it's a thickening, a movement toward the modern no-wave of
    bands like Lightning Bolt, The Locust, and Pink and Brown.  The abrasiveness quotient is at an all-time
    high here, and overall, it's effective in the manner of the previously mentioned noise addicts, although
    this writer wouldn't have minded a bit more strategically positioned minimalism to cut through the
    prolonged blast of super-thick organs and augment the impact of the loud parts. </p><p>
    
    While The Apes lack guitar, they've got this one organ sound that mimics a growling, overdriven axe with
    startling fidelity, and which, along with the deep waves of the low end, ballasts the mutant barrelhouse
    boogie. The title track surges in distinct movements beneath sweaty singing, with a pronounced loud/soft
    dynamic that's almost grunge. The frenetic ""Warp and Wolf"" opens with a brutal detonation that soon
    coheres into staticky, equalizer-flummoxing sheets of mangled organs arranged in punishing, psychedelic
    polyrhythms (think Oneida).</p><p>
    
    This level of intensity is maintained throughout the rest of the EP: low elastic drones, busy atmospheres,
    a rich palette of sonic embellishments, oscillating frequencies and coagulated noise.  At the end of ""Three
    Mages"", the skit-format of the intro makes a jarring reappearance, as Maximilla proclaims: ""And with this
    final stitch I have demonstrated my mastery over tapestries.""  But has she?  Ostensibly, a concept record
    fails if the concept isn't brought to closure and doesn't manifest clearly to the listener, which this one
    isn't and doesn't.  But my ears are ringing.  The little tufts of hair around them are a bit moist, starting
    to curl.  There's a dull afterglow of adrenaline.  Seems like success to me.</p></div>"|219.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/219-tapestry-mastery-ep/|7.0|Brian Howe

Neptune were crammed into the
    corner of Charlie's Kitchen in Cambridge, MA, ripping through a set of disgusting industrial post-punk, at
    once a tight, almost funky band and a piece of kinetic sculpture.  Neptune aren't just another squad of
    noisy art-rockers-- they're a complete package, pulling up to venues in a psychedelic van painted with a
    giant merman (Neptune himself, one supposes), and emerging on stage (when the venue happens to have one)
    with unholy contraptions fashioned from scrap metal by guitarist/vocalist Jason Sidney Sanford.  The drum
    sets are piles of oil cans, circular saw blades and assorted car parts, while the guitar and bass look
    more like medieval weaponry than traditional instruments.</p><p>
    
    And that night in Charlie's Kitchen, after already being flattened by Tyondai Braxton's bracing solo set,
    Neptune bassist Mark William Pearson was swaying wildly back and forth, the jagged prongs that jutted from
    the neck of his scrap bass mere inches from flaying the intrepid souls standing at the front of the crowd.
    It was quite an introduction, and it nearly goes without saying that duplicating the intensity of a live
    performance like that on a record is a tough proposition at best.  But on <i>Intimate Lightning</i>, the
    Boston band's third full-length, they almost manage it.  The short review is that it sounds exactly like
    what you'd expect a band that plays their songs on scrap metal to sound like.</p><p>
    
    The long review is a bit more complicated than that, but Neptune really do accurately approximate in their
    music the tragic and violent desolation of the auto graveyards from which they draw their raw materials.
    The fact that the guitar and bass are built from metal affects the timbre of the instruments, the bass
    sounding harsh, almost distorted, while the guitar rings with surprising clarity.  Percussionists John
    Douglas Manson and Daniel Paul Boucher naturally sound like they're banging on archaic VCR casings, gutters
    and miter boxes, but they play their traps as though they were normal drum sets, with Boucher contributing
    occasional scrapings on a violinish contraption that's the most alien texture on the record.  The cumulative
    effect of all this is a sound that's sort of familiar, but just off enough from a conventional arrangement
    to be disconcerting.</p><p>
    
    The songs are tightly wound nailbombs of rapidly shifting meters, clanging rhythms, and mathtacular
    start/stop passages designed for maximum sensory damage.  Sanford's vocals are secondary, it seems, to the
    grotesque clatter surrounding them-- he whispers and growls squarely in the middle of the mix, perfectly
    content to let the pummeling grooves overwhelm his Dadaist lyrics.  As such, the songs have little overt
    melodic content, but pretty melodies and pop sensibility are clearly beside the point when you're working
    in the same destructive tradition as fellow New England weirdos Lightning Bolt and Zealous Fuel.</p><p>
    
    It would be wrong to say that Neptune display a mastery of their craft, because in this context, the word
    ""dominance"" seems a lot more apropos than ""mastery.""  Seriously, when the sick, militaristic groove of
    ""Automatic"" launches into its distorted reprise, there's no point in trying to resist; you just hunker
    down and let it roll over you like the sonic blitz it is.  That night in Charlie's Kitchen, Neptune were
    more than dominant-- they were mesmerizing and seemingly omnipotent.  <i>Intimate Lightning</i> can't
    compete with that, but it tries anyway, and it comes out brilliantly brutal for the effort.</p></div>"|5901.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5901-intimate-lightning/|7.9|Joe Tangari

    defeatist speech: Puppies grow up into dogs, everything changes, eternal youth is bullshit, and cold,
    crappy maturity is the last unflappable truth.  But it turns out that your mom was totally wrong: Portland's
    The Thermals have successfully flicked off all notions of inevitable evolution, eschewing presumed sophistication
    for dumb, youthful glee.  25 seconds into The Thermals' sophomore record, <i>Fuckin A</i>, shrieks of
    feedback fade into power chords, Hutch Henry begins lodging demands, and it becomes alarmingly clear that
    The Thermals' founding aesthetic-- grimy, lo-fi garage punk-- will endure eternally, a snarled, hyperactive,
    and unchanging homage to goofy basement tapes and kitchen acoustics.</p><p>
    
    That <i>Fuckin A</i> was recorded by Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla (who mastered the band's debut,
    2001's <i>More Parts Per Million</i>) is strikingly apropos; The Thermals are not about reinvention, and
    <i>Fuckin A</i> is-- obviously-- not at all concerned with growing up, even on studio time.  Mostly,
    <i>Fuckin A</i> is as stupidly (and gloriously) irreverent as its title, all adolescent three-chord
    slams and snotty, self-championing chants, a seamless extension of the urgency introduced on <i>More Parts
    Per Million</i>.</p><p>
    
    But despite all their snark and self-repetition, The Thermals are still an immensely likable outfit; like
    a little brother demanding unconditional love, pulling down your pants and then begging for a dollar, The
    Thermals ingratiate themselves quickly and curiously, working against your most rational and justifiable
    complaints.  It's not so much that the band sounds like kids (although sometimes, they sorta do), it's
    that they're brazenly and addictively self-confident, hopped up on spit and adrenaline, fueled by the
    rewards of their own dumb fun.</p><p>
    
    Frontman Hutch Henry's nasal shouts are uncannily similar to Mountain Goat John Darnielle's, and while The
    Thermals' lyrics tend to skew a bit more simplistic (""It's our trip and/ And we're not listening.../ We
    won't flinch/ We don't give a shit""), Henry still wields Darnielle's brand of sharp, scrappy charm awfully
    well. That The Thermals are the direct descendents of twee-folk duo Hutch and Kathy can sometimes seem
    ridiculous, particularly given The Thermals' obvious proclivity for brash, anti-folk stomps, but the
    influence of their lineage becomes more evident the harder you listen-- tracks like ""God and Country""
    admit The Thermals' appropriately desperate politics (""Pray for a new state/ Pray for assassination""),
    while ""Remember Today"" sees Henry adopt a Dylan-esque mix of sentimentality and weird humor (""Anything
    you can see/ You can probably feel/ Anyone far away/ You can probably charge at"").</p><p>
<i>Fuckin A</i> is a bit more political, a bit cleaner, and a bit less exuberant than its predecessor,
    but ultimately, the message is the same. That this is somehow more charming than irritating speaks directly
    to The Thermals' central prowess: beautiful indiscretion.</p></div>"|7991.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7991-fuckin-a/|7.8|Amanda Petrusich

    fingers have been jabbed in eyes or a bag of crazy pills emptied.  With <i>For Octavio Paz</i>, single chair
    Organist Ben Chasny lingers on the path to redemption, but it's a quieter route this time out, and where it
    goes, there's neither electricity nor the need for human voices.</p><p>
    
    The all-acoustic recording was originally released in late 2003 by Time-Lag as limited vinyl.  Now released
    on CD, non-vinyl junkies are given the chance to hear Chasny emoting through his fingers.  On <i>Paz</i>,
    he's discovered a handful of melodies in a rusty Hills Bros can, buried under the humus in a leafy green
    clearing.  They still smell like coffee a little bit, but that aroma mixes with the smell of the woods, and
    carries them on humidity over the graves of caterpillars.  After an introduction of sustaining notes and
    solemn bells, ""When You Finally Return"" establishes Paz's gentle, pastoral tone.  The melody isn't direct;
    it hangs as smoke does in shafts of light.  But with the aid of a few plucked overdubs and his own wordless
    vocal sighs (the only voice heard on the entire record), Chasny insistently and effectively molds both
    song and mood.  The result sticks around like memories of summer evenings.</p><p>
    
    ""Elk River"" is equally evocative, its sway somehow gorgeous and forlorn all at once.  The cut's quiet
    pauses keep fooling you into thinking that the slide show is ending, but Chasny keeps coming back to tell
    another sad tale.  ""They Fixed the Broken Windmill Today""-- its title alone an entire short story-- runs
    on a consistent whisper of nylon strings as deft, vaguely Eastern-tinged fills undulate over the low rumble
    like ribbons in a breeze.  Though they vary from melancholy to warm memory in between notes, the emotions
    Chasny creates on <i>For Octavio Paz</i> are always stark and imagistic.  The recording's first portion
    becomes a meditation in acts, with each track summoning some other piece of Chasny's skill as a player to
    speak without lines.</p><p>
    
    But all of this is mere setup for the lengthy finale, a 28-minute one-man show of steel string poetics
    called ""The Acceptance of Absolute Negation"".  It could be a soundtrack to a murder in the Badlands:
    Spiraling lead notes echo through a petrified forest as the deed is done, followed by a moment of solitary
    meditation.  But mad from the heat and the smell of blood, the realization becomes sudden and painful, and
    there's nothing left to do but run.  Notes tumble over one another, trying to put ground between them and
    the act.  Things slow then to a pensive crawl.  There's a pause, and then another section of contemplation.
    It's an incredible piece, ably and intently drawing on the album's spectrum of moods.  This summer, ride

    punk would not be confined to fashion statements or cathartic brattiness.   Featuring four bands from
    Manhattan's lower East Side, the Brian Eno-assembled compilation highlighted an artistic spirit far removed
    from the ""pretty vacant"" methodology of punk's first wave; as it happened, the sprawling, confrontational
    noise put forth by DNA, The Contortions, Mars, and Teenage Jesus &amp; The Jerks resembled nothing so much as
    similar output by UK second-wave outfits like John Lydon's Public Image Limited or Cleveland-based
    archetypical post-punks Pere Ubu.  That is, their ""confrontation"" came not so much in the physical power
    of the music (though it could be abrasive, to say the least) but in the conviction and often awkward, raw
    execution of their brand of expression.</p><p>
    
    No-wave was as much art-rock as it was punk, and despite its failure to break into the mainstream, its
    ideals were permanently stamped onto scores of musicians afterwards.  Taking direct cues from the short
    movement, bands like Sonic Youth and Swans continued the often dark, grating sonic template of no-wave,
    and ventured even further into conceptual grounds normally associated with modern classical composition
    or performance art.  In some ways, no-wave's successors were merely continuing a long standing New York
    tradition of eclecticism and the post-modern in rock that had been initiated in the 60s by The Velvet
    Underground and influenced by composers La Monte Young, Tony Conrad and Terry Riley.  However, in the 80s,
    alongside a budding (and often antagonistic) American hardcore scene and wildly creative strands of
    post-punk all over the world, what stylistic benchmarks had been attributed to no-wave shattered into
    countless strands of noise, electronic music and the otherwise indescribable.</p><p>
    
    Almost three decades after the fact, New York's art-punks seem to have come full circle-- though the
    landscape of the rock press has not.  Liars have been butchered in most mainstream music rags for making
    ""unlistenable"" music on their latest album, which, to my ears, sounds more like a tribute to art-damaged
    post-punk and no-wave circa 1982 than any kind of radical change in direction.  Likewise, Sightings and
    Black Dice draw from noise, experimental punk and perennial New York faves-from-Japan High Rise and
    Fushitsusha.  Not surprisingly, they get fewer <i>Spin</i> props than more melodically stable NYC outfits
    like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs or The Strokes (both of whom also happen to draw on the early 80s post-punk for
    inspiration, albeit ""new-"" rather than ""no-"" wave).</p><p>
    
    However, Black Dice, like the best of the original wave of avant-rockers, have yet to lapse into redundant
    hero worship or watered-down stylistic approximations.  Depending on how you feel about perpetual forward
    motion, the Brooklyn trio (formerly a quartet, now minus drummer Hisham Bharoocha) could be admirably
    ambitious or maddeningly flighty; thus far, they've established a pattern on their full-lengths of
    abandoning the previous album's sonic palette for something drastically different.  Their earliest releases
    could veer from spiky, violent impressionism to what Pitchfork's Brendan Reid described as ""anti music"" in
    his review of 2001's <i>Cold Hands</i>.  When the band moved to the ultra-hip DFA label for 2002's <i>Beaches
    and Canyons</i>, one might have expected them to dabble in electroclash-- which they sort-of did on the
    ""Cone Toaster"" 12-inch, only to immediately switch gears on the hazy, ambient <i>Miles of Smiles</i> EP
    earlier this year.</p><p>
<i>Creature Comforts</i> is Black Dice's fourth full-length, and second for DFA.  Lo and behold, it doesn't
    sound like anything else they've released.  This record is made from pedals, delay, computers, solemn guitar
    arpeggios, loops, robot jungle sounds and cosmic ambience.  It's almost completely divorced from any strand
    of rock (or even punk), yet sits comfortably alongside fellow New York trippers Suicide and English provocateurs
    Throbbing Gristle.  There are percussive moments, but no real beats; there are noisy moments, but it's hardly
    a ""noise"" record; much of it seems improvised, yet for the most part the album proceeds in a linear fashion,
    as if one long, strange story is unfolding.  Black Dice, apparently unconcerned with establishing their
    noise-rock niche with peers Wolf Eyes or Lightning Bolt, are content to follow their muse as a matter of
    practice.</p><p>
    
    The brief opener ""Cloud Pleaser"" begins with a simple, folkish guitar line (oddly reminiscent of Van
    Morrison's ""Brown Eyed Girl""), and adds electronic bongos, a dash of xylophone and light buzzing sounds
    hard-panned to the left and right.  The subtly insistent pulse established by the small, electronic
    orchestra gives the piece a tropical edge even as the sounds suggest a piecemeal, post-apocalyptic
    Salvation Army setup.  ""Treetops"" takes re-orchestrates that pulse with a ping-pong generator drum and
    distorted space bubbles.  Throughout <i>Creature Comforts</i>, impressions of the jungle-- be they animal
    calls or tribal pound-- shape the soundscape.  The end of ""Creature"" overflows with a wild, nocturnal
    frenzy using live percussion to accentuate the desperate, red-eyed cries of assorted robo-beasts jumping
    and flying about the mix.</p><p>
    
    The 15-minute centerpiece ""Skeleton"" rises slowly, with a slightly warped guitar figure, looped over more
    jungle percussion and unidentifiable humming calls (a human voice?).  Like much of the rest of <i>Creature
    Comforts</i>, ""Skeleton"" features a surprisingly small number of instrumental elements.  Black Dice uses
    them in a way that not only takes advantage of their skill manipulating electronic sound, but also unifies
    the album's otherwise disparate segments.  The piece glides through several sections of propulsive ambience,
    each morphing into the next, and when the hi-hat pitter-patter emerges from a collage of looped guitars,
    the effect is as if stepping out of the jungle into an oasis, even if only for a short moment.</p><p>
    
    I probably shouldn't be surprised to hear such striking moments of clarity.  Black Dice, living up to their
    track record of ever-diligent experimentation and the embrace of change, as well as a vibrant backdrop of
    New York pandemonium, have delivered one of this year's most interesting records and proved that you don't
    have to be noisy to make beautiful noise.</p></div>"|751.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/751-creature-comforts/|8.0|Dominique Leone

Surely these feedbacking subtexts     and threadbare codes will bat nary an eye amid commercial radio pablum or earn even sub-sub-par digitalis     at <em>Billboard</em>, but still, the crunk of wires and modulators slouches towards greater recognition:     Wolf Eyes have become the most raucous act on the big-time Sub Pop roster, suburban teens sport spankin'     new CBGB's tees at Lightning Bolt &amp; Black Dice &amp; Locust throwdowns, Carlos Giffoni's three-day No Fun     festival was pleasantly packed with folks boogying along with To Live and Shave in L.A. like they were     Outkast, and now Hair Police are taking their slash-and-burn to the Solar Stage at Lollapalooza.  These     are baby steps one and all, but allow ye olde timers a flashback to more than a decade of spectacularly     unattended shows by Harry Pussy, Pengo, Blowhole, Shadow Ring, Borbetomagus, Climax Golden Twins, or     Noggin and the attention bespeaks a full-on revolution.</p><p>Hair Police formed in Lexington, KY 2001; <em>Obedience Cuts</em>, their first full-length since 2002's <em>Blow     Out Your Blood</em>, features guitarist and vocalist Mike Connelly at the helm, Robert Beatty on electronics,     and Trevor Tremaine pounding drums and tapes.  For this particularly mesmerizing effort they say they're     ""chronicling the relationship between inside/outside and signaling a call to arms for the GNARLY TIMES.""     I'm not entirely sure about that platform, but there's certainly something bubbling within the album's     violently ecstatic nine tracks.</p><p><em>Obedience Cuts</em> wrangles and wrestles with carcinogens and pops sonic blisters, festering a la Aaron     Dilloway's solo Wolf Eyes' jaunts, soundtracks for the decomposition of vermin; throughout, the percussion's     intense, the sounds ring and shatter.  There are less Negative Approach scowls than the lupine Ann Arbor     supergroup, but Connelly offers how own paranormal howls on the unforgiving monster mash ""Boneless"", and     Spencer Yeh of Burning Star Core Death Beam on hellfire violin.  Elsewhere, Connelly transforms himself     into a possessed and baying hound, informed by the Jesus Lizard's back catalog, on the absolutely searing     percussive spin-cycle ""Open Body"".  Innards receive a lot of lip here, both in title and all-out musical     evisceration.</p>
<p>The facile Wolf Eyes comparison isn't to say this is a mere simulation.  You could as easily namedrop a     less groove-oriented Throbbing Gristle, Cock ESP, and extra especially, an organic rock 'n' roll take on     Whitehouse.  The overdriven opener, ""Let's See Who's Here and Who's Not"", is a spastic roll call built     upon instrumental crescendo sandwiches and distorted howls and yelps.  On a more mellow tip, ""The Empty     Socket"" is a sweaty gong shower scene, complete with a dose of hacking and choking on what I imagine to     be bloody meat stew.</p>
<p>From the drowned (and somehow peaceful) rodent on the cover to the explosive product, <em>Obedience Cuts</em> solicits a well-paced ebb and flow.  The album doesn't tire or lag; it ends up nicely clipped and even     danceable (for the mad) at points.  Released on CD by the Minneapolis' label Freedom From it's also     available also on LP via Gods of Tundra in an edition of 500 copies with a silkscreened chipboard foldover     cover.  (Noise has always been so collectible.)  For those with extra ducats, there are also upcoming     releases on Hanson (including a DVD), Hospital Productions, and Liquid Death/Hello.  But, to bring the     initial comparison full circle and to come to a typical refrain with this sort of kudzu-vine growth     pattern, Hair Police might not have as many releases as Wolf Eyes, but it's safe to say they're catching     up, and <em>Obedience Cuts</em> is a more than adequate spot to start your vision quest.</p>

    remembered in 500 years are Bob Dylan and The Beatles.  At the time, I was pretty sure this was bullshit,
    and today, I'm absolutely positive that it's bullshit.  Maybe it's just the 40-reissues-a-week release
    schedule of the moment that has me confident that at least a healthy cross-section of the 20th century's
    musical output will be remembered in the 26th century, provided we're still around then, but I also think
    the current state of technology mandates that much of it will survive.  We're approaching a point even now
    where the storage media for art are nearly invisible, and with that kind of capacity for information, there's
    no reason some kids in the very distant future shouldn't be able to start a band that some future critic
    will label a ""cross between Sonny Sharrock, Pere Ubu and Wyld Stallions.""</p><p>
    
    Of course, it's hard to imagine how anything will sound original in the 26th century, given the fact that
    it's hard enough these days to escape the dense history of pop music short of growing up in Antarctica and
    doing all of your writing and recording in a corrugated shed on the Ross Ice Shelf.  Toronto-based
    Controller.Controller, however, do manage to bear the weight of a good many influences in their sound, most
    of which can be pinned to the years 1977-1983.  And if you're sick of hearing about new music that owes a
    debt to the post-punk era, hear me out for a couple of 'graphs, because Controller.Controller may fit
    conveniently in the dancepunk mold, but there's a whole lot more to them than just dance-minded rhythm.</p><p>
    
    For one thing, they have Nirmala Basnayake, who spices her vocals with pinches of Debbie Harry and David
    Byrne while delivering some truly excellent melodies.  She's backed in this endeavor by four gentlemen who
    know how to ride and manipulate a groove for maximum effect.  Drummer Jeff Scheven is a human metronome,
    throwing down whip-crack pulse beats that always revolve around a four-on-the-floor center for his bandmates
    to dress up with all manner of rhythmic and melodic flourishes.  Guitarists Colwyn Llewellyn-Thomas and
    Scott Kaija fence with laser-tones leads, distort for vicious stuttering breaks and mine that delicious
    Nile Rodgers pocket for the sake of the dancefloor, while bassist Ronnie Morris locks in with Scheven with
    clean, melodic lines.</p><p>
    
    The opening title track states the band's intentions to move you in every way possible with copious hi-hat,
    scratchy, clean-toned guitar chords and Basnayake's Byrne-ish sing/speak admonitions, ""You need to make
    corrections/ You need to pay attention.""  And that's just one of the nearly constant highlights as the
    band grooves through a half-hour of sharply honed post-disco, shuddering through the frenetic and dramatic
    chord changes and buildups of ""Silent Seven"", and slipping on the viscous rhythms of ""Disco Blackout"".
    Controller.Controller have pulled together a deftly funky debut, as full of thoughtful songcraft as pure
    kinetic energy.  And that's really what separates History from the dance-rock pack-- it's not just something
    to sweat to, it's something to sing along to, and something to come back to.</p></div>"|1768.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1768-history-ep/|8.3|Joe Tangari

    from music's past sometimes uncovers minor tragedies.  Such is the case with pseudo-legendary psychedelic
    soul singer Arthur Brown, whose expansive output has been dubiously summarized on <i>Fire: The Arthur
    Brown Story</i>.  Like many other singularly odd musicians, Brown encountered fleeting success, followed
    by an extended period of decline, neglect and experimentation.  Many artists with similar career arcs have
    since received widespread acclaim as spurned innovators, but time has not been so kind to Brown.  Much of
    <i>Fire</i> sounds painfully dated, and most of the more recent material included on the compilation is
    downright embarrassing.  Though Brown's 1968 classic <i>The Crazy World of Arthur Brown</i> remains a
    sorely underappreciated bit of brilliantly twisted psychedelia, the bewildering selection of tracks here
    prevents <i>Fire</i> from successfully conveying the power of Brown's best work.</p><p>
    Odds are, you've heard 1968's ""Fire"", a brilliant psych-soul epic that's made its way onto countless oldies
    radio stations and compilation CDs.  ""Fire"", which was far and away Brown's most successful single (it shot
    to #2 on the U.S. charts), remains a fabulous song, equal parts profoundly creepy and unbelievably stupid.
    Musically, ""Fire"" perfectly frames Brown's wild, warbling vocals with an insistent bassline and prominent
    organ flourishes.  ""Fanfare: Fire Poem"" covers similar ground, with Brown sing/speak/screaming a recounting
    of an insane acid trip over mutilated jazz noodling.  ""Rest Cure"" explores a more subdued manifestation of
    Brown's early sound, with surprisingly skeletal strings backing more subtly delivered, Bowie-esque vocals.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, not all of Brown's early material holds up so well.  ""Give Him a Flower"" sounds straight off
    a <i>Mr. Show</i> sketch, with cookie cutter musical backing and dialogue so corny that Brown's real English
    accent starts to sound fake.  And as <i>Fire</i> moves forward in time, things only get direr.  Brown's
    penchant for the theatrical is part of what makes his early work so striking, but it occasionally runs
    amok on <i>Fire</i>, yielding some pretty awful results.  ""The Gremlin (The Song Of)"", though excellent
    fodder for Halloween-themed mixes, features a synth arrangement that brings to mind Nintendo's second
    <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> game, and lyrics that would make Current 93's David Tibet blush.
    Indeed, the musical extravagances of the 70s seem to have been seriously detrimental to Brown's work,
    resulting in cheesier arrangements and weaker songs.</p><p>
    Of all the baffling inclusions on this 2xCD set, Brown's recent ballad ""Heartaches"" and an entirely pointless
    cover of ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall"" take the cake.  ""Heartaches"", with its cloying piano arrangement and
    Diane Warren-ish lyrics, immediately derails any emotion Brown's weathered and strange voice could possibly
    convey.  Brown's 5\xBD-minute Dylan cover doesn't fare much better, coming off limp and lifeless in spite of
    a remarkably well-executed insect-like string arrangement.</p><p>
    Though there's loads of questionable material on <i>Fire</i>, it's hard to know what songs apart from those
    on the classic <i>Crazy World of Arthur Brown</i> would be fit for inclusion here.  After Brown reached his
    peak in 1968, the rest of his career consisted largely of well-intentioned but fruitless experiments, most
    of which now sounds dated and silly.  But the enthusiasm and utter lack of shame with Arthur Brown approaches
    his music is part of what makes <i>Fire</i> an intriguing, and ultimately rather depressing listen.  <i>The
    Crazy World of Arthur Brown</i> holds up much, much better as evidence that it is not the novelty of Brown's
    story or situation, but rather the uniqueness of his delivery and approach, that makes him such a compelling
    figure of 60s psych-rock.</p></div>"|1114.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1114-fire-the-arthur-brown-story/|5.2|Matt LeMay

    I forget who's responsible for this half-baked jingle, but the gist of it haunts me whenever I listen to
    such decidedly difficult albums as Vladislav Delay's <i>Demo(n) Tracks</i>, which the presently loved
    Finlander just released on his own label, Huume.  Over the years, Delay has approached his work with a
    remarkable range of motives and <i>nom de plumes</i>-- from hazy deconstructive/reconstructive clicks-and-cuts
    dub as Vladislav Delay; to the absurdly slick but full-faced house as Luomo; to an almost perfect synthesis
    of these two extremes as Uusitalo and the basically channeled Sistol.</p><p>
    
    Even in his least intelligible
    moments of experimentation, when the strict lines separating sound, rhythm and overall structure are
    blurred or disregarded, Delay generally manages the impression that there is at least some method to his
    madness, or some point to his conceit.  There's an unspoken promise that, on any of his albums, Delay
    firstly has censored himself to a great extent, and secondly has carefully crafted all sounds, however
    random or disjointed they seem, to create one unified artistic statement in the end.  And historically
    speaking, Delay consistently delivers in this respect, a simple fact that not only commands him high
    praise, but also an audience willing to work through his most demanding compositions.</p><p>
    
    Particularly aimless albums like <i>Entain</i> or the <i>Helsinki</i> EP have always been (for me, at least)
    Delay's most difficult listens.  From what I can gather, Delay intended some form-is-content/content-is-form
    aesthetic for these records that eschewed typical rhythmic and musical figures, and also the static textures
    and innocuous collages of sound that are ambient music.  Initially, the purple haze and sharp bolts of
    silver noise that fill out <i>Demo(n) Tracks</i> will draw a few comparisons to <i>Entain</i>, but this
    is a far more abstruse release-- and in little time, frustratingly unrewarding.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, there is no apparent internal logic at work within <i>Demo(n) Tracks</i>' 13 songs, and no
    discernible reason why the tracks are even split up as they are.  There's no movement in ideas, no compelling
    expansions or collapses of sound, no set-ups or punchlines or Parthian shots.  Some recourse to structure
    is a natural inclination even when improvising freely, but Delay seems to go out of his way to frustrate
    any remote chance of his passages being obedient to even their own scheme.  Which may be the ""joke"" of
    Delay's album: At every turn, <i>Demo(n) Tracks</i> refuses even the slightest of human nature, in favor
    of a perfectly unstructured sound.  ""You see, you were expecting the album to go somewhere-- but it
    never does!  Hee-haw, avant-garde.""</p><p>
    
    Apparently, <i>Demo(n) Tracks</i> may have been recorded while Delay was hunting ghosts in Berlin, but at
    most, he seems to have schlepped all the discarded sounds from his more successful projects (""Demonit"" is
    a Luomo goldmine) into a randomized play script, and hit the record button for an hour.  The only time
    Delay seems to have something positive to do with <i>Demo(n) Tracks</i> is on the last track, ""Kainuu"":
    50 minutes of lightning bolts finally amount to some sort of pulse, and Delay defers to beat and actual
    musical motion, even giving nylon-stringed alms to a temporary chord progression.  There's not much
    expansion from this idea, but the relative excitement it provides this terribly languid album is
    appreciated.</p></div>"|2558.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2558-demon-tracks/|3.8|Nick Sylvester

    from a formidable onstage mixing board.  With the exception of the often-singing drummer, the musicians
    are almost comically de-emphasized, moving between instruments in precise yet panicky little dashes.  It
    all looks less like a science lab than like a low-budget set of one, complete with slightly overacting
    extras.</p><p>
    Given this visual and the band's off-putting moniker (it's a reference to Steven Soderbergh's <i>Schizopolis,
    if you must know, but then you mustn't), you might expect Namelessnumberheadman to play something profoundly
    anal-retentive, like microhouse.  You certainly wouldn't be prepared for distinctly Western vocal harmonies
    of ""Going to Breathe Again"", the laid-back verses of ""Every Fiber"", or the Nick Drake strum that opens
    ""Mid-Continent"".  For all the considerable studio trickery on display throughout NNHM's second album, its
    primary instrument is the acoustic guitar and its primary mood sweetly elegiac.</i></p><p>
<i>Your Voice Repeating is by no means a folk album crusted over with itchy-scratchy production.  It
    is, like Suzanne Vega's </i><i>99.9\xBA F (and not much else), a completely natural union of ""organic"" (guitar,
    porch) and ""mechanical"" (bedroom, headphones, ACID 4.0) approaches to songwriting-- each informing, mocking
    and correcting the other along the way.  A perfect example of the resulting tension is an instrumental track
    titled, well, ""Tension Envelopes"".  This is a trance title if there ever was one, and for a minute it seems
    as if things are heading in that direction, albeit with added twang.  Over a sampled kick counting eighths,
    a six-beat-long guitar loop shimmers, shifting hypnotically against the beat.  The song then builds to
    the shaggy-dog version of your classic dancefloor crescendo (beats, riffs, keys pile up like an unattended
    </i><i>Tetris</i> game)-- only to resolve, three minutes in, into a languid concerto of mewling slide guitars.</p><p>
    Another stunner, ""Going to Breathe Again"", opens with a tinny breakbeat, tosses up one exquisitely sculpted
    guitar verse reminiscent of The Shins in both sound and quality, and ends on a surprise compromise between
    the two.  Following this level of sophistication, it's hard to go back to, say, The Postal Service, or any
    other band that dresses up verse/chorus/verse structures in IDM drag and calls its job done.</p><p>
    NNHM's songs have a tendency to melt around our ears.  ""Woke Up to Find"" is a Moebius strip of a ballad
    living inside its own ambient intro: A simple main melody is clearly forthcoming-- almost present-- but
    never quite pulls itself into focus.  Elsewhere, a perfect-pop verse disappears suddenly in a swirl of
    elements, swallowed up by the very organs and chimes that made it pleasant to begin with.  The real wonder
    is that there's not a jarring turn on the album: All transitions seem to heed their own dreamlogic.
    Mutations are often subtle and gradual.  My uneducated guess about Namelessnumberheadman's production
    methods is that they sample tidbits of their songs in real time, proceed to digitally twist them into
    abstraction, then un-twist back.  What results is a weirdly humanistic, highly accessible approach to
    experimental electronics.</p><p>
<i>Your Voice Repeating is an album shot through with digital pulses, yet there's not a single moment
    where you don't feel the hand on the button.  Namelessnumberheadman succeed in creating a technocratic
    pasture where machines are given souls but don't turn on their masters.  The album's title, and a short
    song that contains it, spell out the band's manifesto better than I could: Your voice, even put through
    the rude mechanics of repetition, is still your voice.</i></p></div>"|5900.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5900-your-voice-repeating/|8.7|Michael Idov

    for oil or a grab for history, but rather an attempt at creating a so-called manageable chaos in the Middle
    East.  It's hardly an unprecedented idea: By propping up a flimsy, illegitimate regime beholden to foreign
    interests, Iraq will mire in an insurrectionary climate, and our country will gain the justification it needs
    to continue its interference in the region.  The paradox, of course, is that chaos, by definition, is highly
    unmanageable; inevitably, the contradiction doesn't always pan out, and ours is looking more and more like
    such a case.</p><p>
    
    If manageable chaos is what Bush and his cabal were angling for, they'd have been wise to take a page from
    The Dirty Projectors, whose songs consistently threaten to implode under the weight of their own ambitions,
    yet always manage to hold it together.  <i>Slaves' Graves and Ballads</i> effortlessly executes a seemingly
    incoherent, unilateral agenda: Sole-songwriter Dave Longstreth is autodidactic minstrel who occasionally
    seems to be winging it.  Luckily, The Dirty Projectors trade in theatrical folk, not the theater of war;
    the stakes are relatively low, and these 14 songs derive much of their sophistication from a calculated
    lack of order.</p><p>
<i>Slaves' Graves and Ballads</i> is the harmonious wedding of two prior EPs released separately earlier
    this year.  The albums are less complementary than they are starkly juxtaposed.  The divergent A-side/B-side
    architecture provides a tidy stylistic contrast, as the ornate orchestration of the album's first half gives
    way to the demure acousticism of its back end.  The record explores several naturally obscure reference
    points, resembling by turns Stars Like Fleas' shadowy epic <i>Sun Lights Down the Fence</i>, Devendra
    Banhart's indolent folk, and a Gilbert &amp; Sullivan opera.</p><p>
    
    Throughout the record's first seven tracks, Longstreth is accompanied by the ten-piece First Orchestral
    Society for the Preservation of the Orchestra, a chamber music collective assembled by Longstreth himself.
    Fortunately, the panoply of classic instruments-- a readily bastardizable commodity-- isn't used as a
    convenient way to feign sophistication, but instead as a formidable melodic foundation.  From the mesmeric
    marimba ostinato that inaugurates ""Somberly, Kimberly"", <i>Slaves' Graves</i> manages to avoid the cloying
    bravura typically implicit in orchestral pop music.  ""On the Beach"", an easy standout, makes sly intimations
    at a central melody, introducing several motifs that come in and out of focus throughout the ensuing six
    tracks.</p><p>
    
    Generally, Longstreth is left to wander alone, leaving windswept salvos adrift over the orchestra's somber
    ruminations.  His lyrics are unfailingly clever, turning pliable platitudes into weightier fodder.  On the
    unassuming closer ""Since I Opened"" he intones, ""When I start to feel this way/ I can only wonder/ What
    is this weather I'm under?""  Elsewhere, he takes potshots at mundane scenes of modern degradation,
    sing/speaking, ""The souped-up Honda is stalled in traffic on the roadside, burping their subwoof like a
    council of bullfrogs.""  <i>Slaves' Graves</i> is slathered in macabre imagery and dank timbres, but
    Longstreth's sultry drawl is dependably soothing and remarkably fluid.  As dour and gray as the record
    may occasionally get, it's impossible to be sullen by music so boundlessly visceral. The ominous war drums
    behind ""Grandfather's Hanging"" do little to undercut the frail beauty of Longstreth's ambling vocals. Such
    unlikely triumph is par for course.</p><p>
    
    After the dulcet string and clarinet swells of ""Hazard Lights (Reprise)"" the album abruptly segues into
    the spare strumming of ""A Labour More Restful"", initiating <i>Slaves'</i> subdued second half.  Longstreth's
    dainty guitar playing, previously hidden, is born forth, assuming a lead melodic role for the rest of the
    record.  ""Because Your Light Turns Green"" features some surprisingly dexterous licks, recalling erstwhile
    noodlers John Fahey and Vini Reilly.  The scaled-back, nocturnal second set is a refreshing but appropriate
    contrast to the heady arrangements of the opening act. Confused, incohesive and utterly lonely, <i>Slaves'
    Graves and Ballads</i> finds solace in its sadness.  If only the Bush Administration were so gentle.</p></div>"|2535.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2535-slaves-graves-and-ballads/|8.1|Sam Ubl

    for years, respected by a few critics and beloved by a small cadre of fans.  Either out of boredom, commercial
    desperation, creative whimsy, or whatever, you invite several of your musical cohorts-- some very well known,
    others relatively obscure-- and ask them to remix and reinterpret some of your tracks and add their own
    distinctive words and voices.  You then release it as part career retrospective, part self-tribute album,
    part remix album, part self-reinvention, part out-there musical experimentation.</p><p>
    That's the concept behind The Six Parts Seven's new album, <i>Lost Notes from Forgotten Songs</i>, which
    features artists like Iron &amp; Wine's Sam Beam, Modest Mouse's Isaac Brock, Centro-Matic's Will Johnson, and
    Pall Jenkins of The Black Heart Procession reworking and remaking songs mostly from The Six Parts Seven's
    album <i>Things Shaped in Passing</i>.  On paper, it all sounds at the very least interesting, and for the
    most part, the album offers a bizarro-world refraction of the band's quiet, contemplative instrumental
    art-rock.</p><p>
    Even more compelling than the idea, however, is how it plays out-- namely, the absence of a discernible
    formula or pattern from song to song.  For instance, a track's effectiveness is not tied to its length.
    Sam Beam's sparkling ""Sleeping Diagonally"" is not quite 2\xBD minutes long, but that's all it takes for him
    to claim the song as his own.  Conversely, Brian Straw's ""Now Like Photographs"" is epic in comparison,
    approximately five times longer, and his dark, desperate vocals make a perfect counterpart to the binary
    code banjos that fill the six-minute coda.</p><p>
    A carefully crafted song like Isaac Brock's slow-to-still ""From California to Houston, on Lightspeed"" can
    work well against The Six Parts Seven's free-floating sound, but not always, as Pedro the Lion frontman Dave
    Bazan's ""A Blueprint of Something Never Finished"" flatly proves.  On the other hand, some songs sound
    impromptu, as if their singers made them up on the spot.  This approach lends tracks like Will Johnson's
    ""Song of Impossible Things"" a fragile urgency, but a few, like Pall Jenkins' ""Seems Like Most Everything
    Used to Be Something Else"", don't lead anywhere at all, finishing at about the same place they started.</p><p>
    Katie Eastburn is the only singer who purposefully tries to break the subdued mood-- apropos of nothing,
    she literally screams her vocals on ""Cold Things Never Catch Fire"".  Not that she has to maintain any
    specific atmosphere or approach, but her wailing vents no steam and communicates no emotion, striking
    instead as tackily self-indulgent.</p><p>
    If The Six Parts Seven routinely emphasize the patient development of musical ideas and the interplay
    between instruments over traditionally structured songs, this album steers them into newer territory.
    Still, with the emphasis on the voices and not the sounds, on personalities but not on lyrics, <i>Lost
    Notes from Forgotten Songs</i> sounds more like a hodgepodge mixtape than a cohesive album.</p></div>"|7206.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7206-lost-notes-from-forgotten-songs/|6.9|Stephen M. Deusner

More than once my attention has left the
    building during a marathon set that didn't stray from pure, well-oiled precision.  I'm not an aspiring DJ
    or a sample-minded trainspotter, so the actual technique behind the music, though initially novel, doesn't
    keep me absorbed for long.  What I look for from a DJ (and rarely receive) is a one-man show that builds
    tension and offers resolution, a dynamic process similar to that of a strong, inspired band.  Moving asses
    on the dance floor and scoring points for proficiency are certainly admirable accomplishments, but by no
    means impossible, or even unusual; any serious musician should be able to do both.  But to really inspire
    emotion, to resonate powerfully and universally, to make people connect and feel something-- those are the
    pinnacles of live performance.  And when a single DJ-- the modern embodiment of composer, conductor, and
    soloist-- does it all before your eyes, the sense of perfect musical destiny is palpable.</p><p>
    
    In the past, Shadow's club shows have been of a good-not-great caliber, since, no matter how talented the
    DJ, it's tough to really kick shit up onstage just standing at a turntable.  So, taking that working DJ's
    bane to heart, Shadow enlisted Bay Area projection wizard Ben Stokes to step up the visual element of his
    2002 world tour, and was apparently impressed enough with the result that he produced this DVD as a permanent
    document (packaged with an audio version on CD), which (mostly) captures the second evening of a two-night
    run at London's Brixton Academy.</p><p>
    
    Even after Shadow ""demystifies"" his creative tools, pointing out his inventory (two Technics 1200s, two
    CDJs and a sampler/sequencer) in a monotone monologue intro, it's still nearly impossible to determine how
    he smoothly wrangles so many layers of sound.  The show moves through five movements and an encore, each
    blending tracks from Shadow's entire catalog, creating something like a remixed symphony that ebbs and
    flows, rises and falls, with rigorous attention paid to dynamics.  Shadow states in this release's liner
    notes that his prior live efforts ""only really got interesting when the songs were not only on time but
    in tune as well.""  Here, along with the visual backdrops that accompany the songs on three large screens,
    the segues and arrangements that link them become a crucial part of the concert experience.</p><p>
    
    With the exception of a brief lull midway through the set, Shadow emerges totally successful.  He even
    encourages the crowd early on to consider the mostly downtempo performance as a ""late night movie.""  The
    narrative imagery that appears during ""Building Steam with a Grain of Salt"" and graceful, street-level
    driving shots that accompany ""What Does Your Soul Look Like (Part 2)"", both from <i>Endtroducing...</i>,
    give an epic, storybook feel to these already dramatic numbers.  When Shadow twists the Richard Ashcroft
    vocals on ""Lonely Soul"" into ""Lost &amp; Found"", Stokes offers an abstract, swirling background that matches
    the songs' spiraling rhythms.  During the profound ""You Can't Go Home Again"" encore, city scenes blend
    into windswept beaches, mirroring the song's moody, bittersweet grandeur.</p><p>
    
    As the film cuts through multiple angles, we get the up-close DJ handcam as well an overhead, full array
    cam that reveals a massive tangle of music equipment that, from this distance, wouldn't appear out of
    place in a 747 cockpit.  All the while, Shadow's own post-production makes use of split-screen panels
    and overlapping to offer the home viewer visual effects to which the head-nodding punters in London
    weren't privy.  In ways, it's almost damaging for this set to be this stunning, as it could too greatly
    heighten expectations for Shadow's future shows.  Then again, if he's capable of living up to it on
    upcoming tours, his may well go down as the greatest show in turntablism.</p></div>"|2376.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2376-live-in-tune-and-on-time/|8.4|Jonathan Zwickel

    instructive: Three of the six songs have proper names in or as their titles, suggesting that they are
    about real people and actual relationships.  Hell, the Philadelphia band is even named for its singer and
    songwriter, Joey ""Jojo"" Sweeney, who mixes autobiography and fiction against the group's 70s-inflected
    indie pop, resourceful-- and unabashed-- enough to digress into an E Street interlude or an AM-rock guitar
    coda.  <i>Fishtown Briefcase</i> (the title refers to a 24-pack of beer with a handle) features songs as
    character sketches, exploring how people think and act as well as what they mean specifically to Sweeney.</p><p>
    For example, the lead-off track, ""Evelyn Rochman"", recalls a Tadpole-style hook-up between a high school-age
    Sweeney and the title character, who is ""my dad's wife's friend/ And in our ages there's a difference of
    ten.""  But ""as the Penguin Café Orchestra plays low,"" she regales him with tales of Richard Hell and
    introduces him to both The Modern Lovers and modern love.  Regardless of whether Evelyn is real or invented,
    Sweeney lets her craft his own coming-of-age, both musical and otherwise, while nicely understating the
    bittersweet brevity of their relationship.</p><p>
    Four songs into <i>Fishtown Briefcase</i>, ""(A Girl Called) Young Song"" finds Sweeney several years older
    and not nearly as hopeful, confronting another woman from his past.  He sees Young Song, apparently an old
    friend of an old friend, ""dancing on the tabletop in the backroom at the Love Lounge.""  But he can't join
    her fun, and ""I've got nothing important in my life tonight"" is the best he can come up with in the way
    of a pick-up line.</p><p>
    Even on the songs that aren't named after people, he still focuses on character.  On ""The City Let Me"",
    Sweeney considers a particular city's effect on his musical development and claims he ""got so sick of
    indie rock/ 'Cause it sounds so white and privileged/ And man, privilege is just another drag.""  This
    from a man playing well-groomed, Pavement-descended indie rock himself.  What keeps a statement like that
    from being damningly hypocritical is Sweeney's unreliability as a narrator: His songwriting approach
    ostensibly focuses on other people as a way to get outside himself, but actually, people like Young Song
    and Evelyn Rochman are merely a means for Sweeney to get back into himself.  While he doesn't always seem
    to be aware of this, he makes it perfectly clear for the listener: These people are his mirror.</p><p>
    As a result songs like ""The Amazing Malcolm Smith (And His Off-Roading Motorcycle)"" and the cover of Wings'
    ""Listen to What the Man Said""-- which are about celebrities as opposed to Sweeney's personal acquaintances--
    don't reflect quite so much, and the lovely specificity of his lyrics dulls just a bit.  ""The Amazing Malcolm
    Smith"" delves into the homoeroticism between the titular stuntman and his Steve McQueen with a few innuendos
    like, ""Don't you be afraid of bareback riding.""  While Sweeney never plays the material for laffs, the song
    still sounds a bit lightweight sandwiched between ""The City Let Me"" and ""Young Song"".</p><p>
    The final track, a don't-go-to-bed-angry ballad called ""I Hope Your Sleep Is Dreamless"", throws the previous
    five tracks into sharp relief, hinting that the people we're closest to are the ones we know the least.  The
    lover, whether a man or woman, is never named, and the magnitude of their troubles is only implied, but the
    na-na-na's at the end don't sound like a real catharsis as much as like the unquenchable hope for one in
    the morning.</p></div>"|8260.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8260-fishtown-briefcase-ep/|7.8|Stephen M. Deusner

    Green CD</i> is an odd-and-ends anthology of material recorded over the course of the collective's career.
    Formatted like a mixtape, the album combines the work of three very different MCs and rarely strays from
    the generic, angry, independent thug topics (sex, drugs, murder) that Non Phixion mastered elsewhere.</p><p>
    
    The content is less than polished-- the majority of the tracks are freestyles, unfinished songs and radio
    drops.  The muddy, unprofessional sound quality of the album's on-air recordings complements the dark and
    aggressive nature of the group.  One of the unfortunate drawbacks to recorded freestyles is their occasional
    lack of replay value-- a problem to which Non Phixion is not immune.  Those songs exist almost completely
    for punchlines and solid sequences, so by this token, Non Phixion typically impress (""Drugged out, 'cause
    hash rules everything around me""; ""If I disappear, the masons took me"").</p><p>
    
    That isn't to say there aren't several studio tracks here to whet the appetites of Uncle Howie fanatics
    ahead of the release of solo albums from each member of Non Phixion.  There are roughly 10 studio songs
    here, depending on your definition, and the most successful songs are newly recorded (""We All Bleed"",
    ""Caught Between Worlds"").  The rest, however, are rendered uninteresting by either a lack of conceptuality
    or by mundane production.  So, your enjoyment of this album effectively hinges on your interest in the art
    of battle rap.</p><p>
    
    The album's standout comes with ""Caught Between Worlds"", a focused meditation on the white ghetto experience
    and the gritty adolescence of our antiheroes.  Domingo's production sounds like the nouveau RZA-tempered
    sped-up soul we've come to expect from the Rocafella camp, but is ultimately a new, effective fit for Non
    Phixion.  The verses are emotional, chock-full of word pictures: Ill Bill claims his ""mind is like the
    script from an Italian gore flick,"" Goretex recounts his matriarchal appreciation (""It started back in
    apartment buildings, poverty stricken/ Mom was sick but I still felt her love from the kitchen"") and Sabac
    Red reminisces on early problems with drugs (""I got high and did the running man"") and education (""A badass
    in math class, I had to change teachers"").</p><p>
    
    As a rarities collection, <i>The Green</i> fails.  It's missing their best-known non-album tracks (""Thug
    Tuning"", ""I Shot Reagan"", ""5 Boroughs""), it's relatively short, there are no real topics explored, and
    the beats are uninteresting-- especially when compared to the group's more thoughtful work.  In short, <i>The
    Green CD</i> is clearly a collection for Non Phixion completists.  On the plus side, the limited edition DVD
    is beautifully assembled, the lines are relatively consistent, and the tone of the album is both shadowy
    and a good representation of where they've been coming from over the course of their career.  On the whole,
    however, it's just a teaser for upcoming albums from Sabac, Goretex, Necro and Mr. Hyde.</p></div>"|5832.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5832-the-green-cd/|6.1|Rollie Pemberton

Who'd have thought in
    the mid-80s, when John Zorn's discography was defined by discrete projects, genre collisions and tributes
    to lesser-known past jazzmen, that this would become the model for all ""major"" jazz labels by the end of
    the 90s: If a record doesn't have a concept-- be it ""the calypso album"" or ""remember Eric Dolphy?"" or ""let's
    cover Björk!""-- it can't be marketed, the critics have no hook to discuss, and there's nothing to move it
    to the top of the pile.  The towering back catalogs of jazz overwhelm all new releases, so for the newer
    guys, just playing great music doesn't seem like an ""occasion"" anymore.</p><p>
    Dave Douglas and Bill Frisell-- respectively, the leader and guest star on <i>Strange Liberations</i>--
    thrive in this environment.  Their records receive steady distribution and attention from the press, and
    each features a new group or project: Frisell going from folk and Americana to a highly original world
    music melting pot (last year's <i>The Intercontinentals</i>), while Douglas splits his time between diverse
    working bands, chaotic evocations of social protest, and idiosyncratic but thoughtful homages to his heroes.</p><p>
    The quintet featured here debuted on <i>The Infinite</i>, which was pegged as a Miles Davis tribute for its
    late-60s quintet sound and Uri Caine's use of a Fender Rhodes keyboard.  But with <i>Strange Liberation</i>,
    as the band begins to sound lived in and Douglas writes a set of beautifully melodic compositions, we get a
    record that needs no tagline (Frisell's appearance notwithstanding).  The opposite of last year's eclectic,
    electric, sometimes hectic <i>Freak In</i>, <i>Strange Liberation</i> blends Douglas' ideas smoothly into a
    set of music that's simply one of the best written, paced and performed works in his catalog.</p><p>
    The flow is so strong that the best way to enjoy the record is end-to-end.  Douglas leads some songs in a
    strident tone, his trumpet plaintively echoing Booker Little in songs that evoke the urgency of social
    justice; but next to those tracks lope easier, angular songs like ""Skeeter-ism"".  James Genus straps on
    an electric bass for the funk-fusion ""Catalyst"", but that's preceded by the pining muted trumpet on ""The
    Jones"", and drummer Clarence Penn-- as responsible as anyone for the album's buoyant pace-- goes from
    propulsive rhythms to Paris springtime clouds of cymbals.</p><p>
    Douglas fronts the quintet next to reedsman Chris Potter and Caine, who again sticks to Fender Rhodes.  While
    not as typecast as, say, the harpsichord, that keyboard usually evokes a specific era of 70s fusion, either
    gritty funk or light-as-a-feather ringing spaces.  Caine taps those memories but ditches them at will, as
    he maneuvers the instrument into every mood he's given-- which must have been harder than he makes it sound.</p><p>
    And then there's Frisell, who's moved so far from straight jazz on his own records-- his trio sets even
    include a designated bluegrass section-- that it's easy to forget how often he comes back to it, in his
    recent duets with Dale Bruning or his annual gigs with the Paul Motian Trio.  Douglas wrote several of
    these tunes for his guest, like ""The Frisell Dream"", which nods to its namesake's broad cow-poke writing
    style, as he amicably pokes elbows with the rhythm section; the frontloaded ballads showcase his melancholy
    lyricism, but Douglas also throws him into surf-rock on one track and wide-open space on another.  He opens
    ""Mountains from the Train"" with gently exhaled tones and delay pedal loops broken by wood-thudding harmonics--
    still among the most beautiful sounds ever wrung from an electric guitar.</p><p>
    A lot of ideas simmer under the easy give-and-take on this record, but <i>Strange Liberation</i> takes all
    the fractured references and subprojects of the players' careers and buries them under the skin, as they
    sit down for a straight blowing session.  And they shouldn't need an occasion for that.</p></div>"|2538.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2538-strange-liberation/|8.2|Chris Dahlen

    difference made their albums memorable; it put pose and genre fulfillment second to songs and singularity.
    <i>Runaway Found</i>, the full-length debut from England's The Veils, derives its greatest depths from a
    similar well.  It benefits from the even-handed lushness of co-producer Butler, and perhaps a bit of
    mentorship between he and head Veil Finn Andrews.  But it also understands the role of pace in crafting
    resonance and has a gleaming diamond of the traditional model in the wail and stance of young Andrews.
    It's no fair: Mother England keeps birthing charismatic frontmen while America offers failed crops of
    bald and vengeful shoutmongers.</p><p>
<i>Runaway Found</i> is quite a classy thing.  Check the evocative, selenium-toned cover art, or even its
    Rough Trade imprint if that's your game.  Electric guitars are rabid or echoing, depending on the moment;
    acoustics simmer like quiet <i>Urban Hymns</i>.  That album's influence is apparent in the keening strings
    of ""Wild Son"", too, but it's Butler behind the board, so the instrumental layering of his solo work is a
    touchstone.  <i>Runaway Found</i> illuminates, with equal patience, the hovering dust particles in the
    spacious ""Talk Down the Girl"" and the hopeful guitar bends of the upbeat ""Guiding Light"".</p><p>
    However, as dynamic as its backgrounds get, the album never defocuses from Andrews' willowy whoops and
    whine-- he wrote the songs, after all.  For much the same reason, he can also be overdramatic, like a
    bruised ego poet haunting the university café. (Thom Yorke is an apparition floating in the soupy reverb
    and non-sequiturs of ""Vicious Traditions"".)  ""Lavinia"" might have fared similarly, but instead it's one
    of the album's strongest points, filling five-plus roiling-sea minutes with weepy descending strings,
    insistent piano, and an incredible performance from Andrews that surveys the heartache and expressive
    power of every vocalist since Britpop's zenith.</p><p>
    Like Elbow's <i>Cast of Thousands</i>, <i>Runaway Found</i> shifts ably between warmth and spiny
    soul-searching.  There's grace between its acrid smoke and strobe light flashes (""More Heat Than Light"")
    and subtle, slightly sad builds (""Leavers Dance"").  ""If only you could stay and not leave me behind,""
    Andrews whines on ""Tide That Left and Never Came Back"", but the song finds a balance between pain and
    resigned fate, tempering Andrews' sorrow and its ragged guitar breaks with happier rhythm guitar doodle
    and sunny supporting harmonies. It's another Butler-helmed production and seems touched with his ability
    to find maturity in simple textures or the folds of a shirt. Of course, there's depth to The Veils' songs.
    But there's no question that <i>Runaway Found</i> is a better album for its attention to layering and pace.</p><p>
    Brit-rock at mid-decade needs to take stock. Its past giants are still confidently (and rightly) influential,
    and more-recent comers have found inroads to bling across the pond.  But in the margins there are baubles
    of the just-okay.  They're groups that glow with talent but give off shadows shaped liked question marks.
    Despite its maturity, melodic strength, and direct connection to what came before, <i>Runaway Found</i>
    can't fully distance itself from the suspicion that it might just be ""eh"" in the long run.  But The Veils
    prove England's version of just-okay is still better than America's gang of post-grunge blowhards, tuning
    their Paul Reed Smiths in astro wedgie recovery therapy.</p></div>"|8532.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8532-runaway-found/|7.1|Johnny Loftus

Oh, mademoiselle, I am sure you have never heard
    anything like them-- they are one of a kind.  Let me bring you some baguettes and
    I will tell you all about them.</p><p>
    Ah, yes, I brought some olive paste for you, too. Can you hear that? I had Richard
    put it in the jukebox for us, yes? Oh, ma'moiselle, I spent many years playing the
    accordion until the terrible accident, and when I first heard them and was healed!
    What's that?  Oh, the accident... ma'moiselle, I don't much like to discuss it, but
    I can see by the light in your eyes that you simply must know. Very well, I am
    unable to resist such beauty.</p><p>
    It was on my 18th birthday and I had just won the Accordion Medal of Harmony for the
    provence. It was my moment of triumph, my moment to spit in the faces of the infidels
    that laughed at me when I sat on my doorstep and played my accordion instead of
    playing ball.  That night, I took in a beautiful feast held at the finest restaurant
    in the provence.  All of my old friends and many new ones were there and shared in my
    happiness. There was drink and song and it was an incredible night! I met a beautiful
    girl there, and in my flush I kissed her!  Yes, it was brash, some might say
    impertinent, but when one is drunk on life and wine, one rarely thinks of these
    things, yes? I kissed her again and again, our ardour growing, until she led me to
    her loft and I made beautiful love to her!  Ah, such wistful eyes she had.  Suddenly,
    what seemed like moments after I drifted to sleep in her arms, I heard a thunderclap
    crack and felt the most intense pain in my key-hand that made me grow feint. A man,
    a man that I later learned was my sweetheart's elder brother, was holding a silver
    urn in his hands and driving it down on my fingers.  Oh, the pain! I've grown faint
    now just telling you of it!  The doctor cared for my hand as if it were his own, but
    I shall never play the accordion again.
    </p><p>
    All was lost for me until I first heard them.  Everything I heard before was as a
    single forgotten note before them.  Their music made me accept the loss of my own
    music, my sorrow is their sorrow. I hear the drums being brushed, the warm piano, and
    the love of music can return in my soul without the pain of never baing able to make
    it again. What do you think of his voice?  Oh yes, it's like molasses, maple syrup,
    thick fog, a rich sauce, so many good things. Their music has sorrow and dignity,
    together like so few others.
    </p><p>
    Yes, listen. Though they remain great, this particular record is a soundtrack for a
    film! Could you guess that? No! Why? Yes, you're right, few soundtracks these days
    are so delicate, so nuanced and stylish. Yes, the whole thing is merely them. Is
    that a small thing? I don't think so. Coffee is small, yes, but complex, bold and
    big, yes both small and big. I know you understand.
    </p><p>
    So many of the cafes have changed. They play that insignificant pop music and forget
    where they come from!  Children crying about their problems!  Disgusting, I say!
    Listen-- this song was the first song I ever heard. It was also on their second
    record. It's called ""Tiny Tears."" Ah, such feeling. Sincerity is so rare nowadays.
    Would you like me to get you some wine, yes?
    </p><p>
    You've noticed that there's few words? I know, 'tis a shame that Stuart Staples--
    that is his name, the singer-- isn't much on this record. I miss him. If I were able,
    I would kiss his hands and face for saving my life, saving the life of a poor
    accordion player.

    into a stomach-wrenching depression of unrequited love, dejection and self-loathing.  A descent into an
    abyss of Leonard Cohen, The Smiths and penning terrible poetry is the only refuge against the taunting
    pop-perfection embodied in this cute Swedish chanteuse.  You'd sweep your cumbersome, floppy fringe to
    one side in disbelief if someone told you what a tortured existence the one-time queen of bubbly European
    indie-pop really leads.  And a listen to The Cardigans' latest record in all its po-faced bitterness will
    have you scratching your head in confusion at the seeming paradox of the polished direction the rest of the
    band have taken contrasted with Persson's world-weary laments.</p><p>
    Peter Svensson and Magnus Sveningsson formed The Cardigans back in 1993, enlisting untrained vocalist Nina
    Persson after playing hardcore for years-- inspired by a joint passion for heavy-metal music.  <i>Long Gone
    Before Daylight</i> shows that classic rock runs in their blood, despite an inauguration of kitschy indie
    releases including 1995's acclaimed <i>Life</i>.  The follow-ups-- 1996's <i>First Band on the Moon</i> and
    1998's <i>Gran Turismo</i>-- showed attitude and poise respectively, but this new album is less experimental
    musically.  The ""woah-oh-oh-oh""'s and solid opening riff of ""A Good Horse"" recall 80s soft-rock a la Jon
    Bon Jovi as Persson's voice cracks, layering the hyperbole thus: ""These are the promises I can keep/ To
    live like I must/ And ride with the dust in my face/ In Grace.""  Equally anthemic and overstated is the
    gratuitous reverb and echoes that saturate the epitomic pop of ""You're the Storm"".</p><p>
    Perhaps the 2003 A-Camp project with Sparklehorse frontman Mark Linkous was supposed to be a kind of misery
    summer-camp for Persson to vent her unlucky-in-love frustrations.  Despite those murkier exercises, this
    release sees The Cardigans trawling through lost-love, damaging relationships and substance abuse.  With
    these downbeat themes, it's hardly surprising that several tracks bear a New Country-esque twang as on the
    opener ""Communication"".  The trebly guitar riffing and thin strings combine with soaring harmonies to
    position the track closer to Nashville than Jonkoping, Sweden.  In ""Please Sister"", when Persson wails, ""Oh,
    sweet mama, please just send me a man,"" is that a Tennessee drawl stretching ""man"" through several syllables?</p><p>
    It has long been the business of the most mainstream pop to enlist several maxims to connect with an
    audience where more ""serious"" artists might induce more original musings.  The Cardigans have a respectable
    history of insightful songwriting which excuses the clichéd concerns here as perhaps pop-revision or at
    least a knowing tribute.  ""For What It's Worth"" and ""Couldn't Care Less"" are rife with hooks and juxtapositions
    straight out of Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman's hit factory, while retaining a bitter, mature edge that separates
    the Swedish five-piece from less substantial popsters.  Persson's singing departs from her contained and
    clear intonation to hint at cute and rough in turn, while never testing her range or ability.  The production
    also takes few risks, keeping the instrumentation tight and compressing and polishing the mix almost
    oppressively.  Where the personality of the immensely talented band used to vibrate with energy, here they
    too often languish complacently in a radio-friendly sibilance.</p><p>
    That this is the least idiosyncratic sound they have achieved is at odds with some of the darker musing in
    Persson's lyrics.  The record's best track, ""And Then You Kissed Me"", treads the by-now-familiar bittersweet
    relationship ponderings that constitute the bulk of this record's concerns.  However, amidst sharp observations
    and clever wordplay, there are darker implications to lines like, ""Blue blue, black and blue/ Red blood
    sticks like glue/ True love is cruel love.""  ""Feathers and Down"" seems to entail alcoholism whereas ""the
    little holes in your veins"" (""Communication"") could be interpreted to allude to stronger poisons.</p><p>
    The Cardigans are an entirely different band from their initiation, and perhaps this is the way it should
    be.  Desire to explore new territories gives greater satisfaction and a constant attempt to defy expectations
    usually wrings some new invention from an aging band.  Lucky U.S. purchasers get hold the bonus tracks ""Hold
    Me"" and ""If There Is a Chance"", as well as the limited edition DVD of the videos for ""For What It's Worth""
    and ""You're the Storm"".  The European and more notably Japanese audiences do not collect these goodies.
    As these are audiences already well and truly won over this could be seen cynically as a subtle bribe,
    but one glance at the lovely Nina and you'll forgive the backhander.</p><p>
    Seemingly unwilling to sever its pretty head-- infected with melancholy as it is-- the body of the band
    twitches unfettered with their slickest and most formulaic pop constructions to date.  It's unfortunate
    that honing and polishing a certain pop style to perfection has squeezed some of the life from the group.
    There's nothing so catchy as 1996's hit single ""Lovefool"" here, nor is there anything as pretty and wry
    as <i>Life</i>'s opener, ""Carnival""-- just a collection of solid, personal pop songs, no more.</p></div>"|1305.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1305-long-gone-before-daylight/|6.5|Dan Lett

    were young, or circle album release dates or try to anticipate when a record will leak.  More often than
    not, I instead brace myself for disappointment-- even from those whose work I most cherish.  It's a
    pessimistic and potentially sad approach, but one that unfortunately seems to cushion blows more often
    than result in pleasant surprises.  With the debut full-length from Junior Boys, I let my guard down.
    After two EPs of glacial, silken electro-pop (2003's <i>Birthday</i> and this year's <i>High Come Down</i>), I just
    flat-out wanted more.  Thankfully, I got it.  <i>Last Exit</i> may be my anti-<i>A Grand Don't Come for
    Free</i>-- a little album I waited for with open arms rather than gritted teeth-- but its heights eclipse
    virtually all other music I've heard this year.</p><p>
    
    The (to date) quiet rise of the Junior Boys is well-documented in the virtual world of the blogosphere,
    which for the most part has gone totally bonkers for the Ontario trio.  Over the past year, the rapturous
    praise has been so constant that listing off the band's generous number of touchstones has practically
    become sport.  Tellingly, though, for every time someone says Junior Boys sound like Timbaland goes for
    New Pop, an amorous two-step trying to coax indie-pop onto the dancefloor, or David Sylvian rummaging
    through Martin Fry's wardrobe and Basic Channel's outtakes, that person is only telling a part of the
    tale.  More often than not, Junior Boys capture the mood and feel of many of these artists rather than
    ape their sounds.  In fact, each of this record's 10 deceptively simple and very approachable tracks carry
    the distinct fingerprints of lead songwriter and singer Jeremy Greenspan, who manages to fold elements of
    nearly a quarter-century of forward-looking pop into a distinct sound without sounding either conceptual
    or trading on contradictions or the smoke-and-mirrors of attention-grabbing eclecticism.</p><p>
    
    Four of the album's tracks-- ""Birthday"", ""Last Exit"", ""High Come Down"", and ""Under the Sun""-- were first
    released on last year's EPs and sit nicely alongside the new songs.  Thankfully, Junior Boys are neither
    shying away from what they do best because of the success of those singles, nor failing in an attempt to
    reach those same heights.  Among the new songs, ""Teach Me How to Fight"" is anthemic Sophistipop, a shrinking
    violet rallying cry; the nocturnal orchestral maneuvers of ""Three Words"" delicately flicker beneath ""Neon
    Lights""; and ""Bellona"" flutters and clicks as Greenspan laments long days and lost opportunities.</p><p>
    
    So, yes, despite the high dance IQ and its luxuriously monochromatic sensuality, the record does seem very...
    indie.  On ""Teach Me"", Greenspan is requesting to ""show me what it's like to give back pain,"" as his
    paper-thin voice projects honesty, vulnerability and the puppy-dog loyalty of sentimental, pale-skinned
    boys.  So thankfully that's the fey, Anglocentric early 80s sense of the phrase ""indie,"" then, albeit
    dressed up with graceful, hopeful romanticism rather than self-deprecating fatalism.  At times, that sense
    of hope seems buried under throbbing beats or kept at arm's length by cold, pristine sonics, but dip your
    toes beneath that sleek surface and you'll find an album of great warmth, beauty and even soul.</p></div>"|4340.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4340-last-exit/|8.9|Scott Plagenhoef

Whether
    this comes from urinating birds, air conditioning condensation, observation deck spitting, or suicide
    jumpers breaking down into their constituent beads of bloody moisture over the long 145-story leaps from
    skyscrapers, I've yet to determine.  The Times Square subway station has been under construction for at
    least four years.  The majority of Village eateries I frequent do not accept credit cards.  The city
    tobacconists all spell the first letters of ""Smoke Shop"" with two pipes, making the storefront signs look
    more like ""Jmoke Jhop.""  Garbage is laid out on the sidewalks, as real estate shortages allow for no
    alleys.  The Mormon Temple across from the Lincoln Center has fantastic free peanut butter cookies, if
    you sit through one of their thinly veiled brainwashing video tours.</p><p>
    
    None of these elements of New York, which I find more indicative of the town, are mentioned on the Beastie
    Boys' <i>To the 5 Boroughs</i>.  Instead, Adrock, MCA and Mike D offer obvious demographic and transit
    information on their ""Open Letter to NYC"".  ""Asian, Middle Eastern, and Latin/ Black, White, New York/ You
    make it happen,"" they croon together on the chorus to the centerpiece of their sixth album.  ""Brooklyn,
    Bronx, Queens, and Staten/ From the Battery to the top of Manhattan,"" they read like a free hotel map.
    What, nothing rhymed with Inwood?  The song makes fantastic use of a Dead Boys sample (who were from
    Cleveland), but fumbles the execution with their Up With People chants.</p><p>
    
    Lyrically, the Beastie Boys fail to make a convincing justification for their hometown pride beyond slogans
    that could fit on a t-shirt.  The answering machine message of <i>Paul's Boutique</i> conveyed more giddy
    pride in the nuances and uniqueness of the metropolis.  In a trademark (or typical, or tired, depending on
    your perspective) deep pop culture reference, Adrock mentions Gnip Gnop, a 1970s Parker Brothers game that
    was like a cross of <i>Pong</i> and <i>Hungry Hungry Hippos</i>.  ""Jmoke Jhop"" would have rhymed perfectly.
    In their attempt to point out the details of their city, the Beastie Boys offer little more than the view
    from the top of a sawn-off double-decker tour bus.</p><p>
    
    At this point in time, no measure of analysis regarding cadence, meter or goofy references will sway the
    pros and cons of the Beastie Boys' lyrics.  They do what they do, and even my mother knows their M.O.
    What <i>To the 5 Boroughs</i> offers, contrary to naysayers who mock aging bands, are three voices showing
    intriguing texture from wear and experience.  MCA sounds like the Harry Nilsson of hip-hop after a lost
    weekend.  Adrock, especially, shows greater range in style.  From his leisured easy-speaking on ""Crawlspace""
    to the Eminem-like syllable play on ""Hey Fuck You"", he puffs his chest with laid-back economy and moves away
    from the stereotypical nasal whine of their younger days.</p><p>
    
    Where the true influence of New York exerts itself on <i>To the 5 Boroughs</i> is in the stark rhythms,
    which filter the cold continental-sampling breaks of rap pioneers like Jimmy Spicer and The Treacherous
    Three through Apple processors.   The streamlined foundations both pay tribute to the crews that influenced
    the Beastie Boys to put down their Bad Brains and Reagan Youth aspirations and lays a hard digital direction
    for the Bush Youth to follow.</p><p>
    
    Unlike all previous Beastie Boys albums (with the possible exception of
    <i>Licensed to Ill</i>), <i>To The 5 Boroughs</i> sounds homogenous and singular in purpose-- dark, steel,
    and dirty like that incomplete Times Square station.  <i>Ill Communication</i> and <i>Hello Nasty</i>
    reveled in genre-dipping, from hardcore and salsa to dub and disco.  Their decision to settle into a focused
    hip-hop direction here seems like a sage move.  The album succeeds in its seeming spontaneity.  ""Seeming""
    in that they possibly spent years making it.  But whatever length of gestation, the album's easy air speaks
    to veteran, nothing-to-lose attitude of both the city and the group.</p><p>
    
    Still, my interaction with music goes well beyond simple, academic analysis of sound.  Nostalgia, emotional
    context, the continued story and history behind the artist, the packaging, and everything else matters in my
    love and fascination with music.  This is why writing for Pitchfork, which prides itself on discovering unknown
    underground artists, means so little to me anymore.  Listening to music as some form of continued, insular
    experiment with recording driven by faceless, MP3-based rock bands bores me.  I was immediately prepared to
    love <i>To the 5 Boroughs</i> from my history with the band-- from listening to <i>Ill</i> while playing
    Atari with Andy Eberhardt, to mowing neighborhood lawns with Gregg Bernstein and <i>Paul's Boutique</i> in
    a walkman, to holding my portable CD player off the front cushion of my Buick Century to keep <i>Check Your
    Head</i> from skipping as I passed over the speed bumps in the Marist parking lot every day after my Junior
    year, to shooting bottle rockets from poster tubes at passing trucks on 400 off the roof of the AMC multiplex
    I worked at when <i>Ill Communication</i> came out.  It is not mentally possibly for me to switch on apathy
    towards the group.</p><p>
    
    When all is said and done, I have spun <i>To the 5 Boroughs</i> at least 30 times while working on some of
    the most rewarding and enjoyable creative work of my life in the past couple weeks, while visiting a city
    I love, and seeing people I missed.  The album has become intrinsically linked to these experiences-- from
    my movie premiere this week to the surreal tour of the Manhattan Mormon Temple last week.  The little number
    at the top of this piece reflects little of personal relation to the record.  It's an arbitrary guide to
    how I would expect people to gauge the intent of this review.  I will listen to this album for years to
    come.  You might.  Or not.  It depends on your own complex web of past interaction with the Beastie Boys,
    linked memories to the music, or preconceived notion of how hip or not it is to listen to them in 2004.</p><p>
    
    Though I would fail to quantify the comparative ""quality"" of such albums, as I said before, I love <i>Carl
    &amp; The Passions</i> as much as <i>Pet Sounds</i>.  Divorcing the lives and backstory from the recorded
    product of a musical artist equates to making movies without characters.  The sixth Beastie Boys album
    holds much more intrigue than some young dudes with bedhead thinking they're going to evolve rock and roll.
    I've ended up listening to it more than any other release this year.</p><p>
    
    This process has become unexciting and routine, which is why I bid the world of music writing farewell.
    Explaining why I love a record in the confines of its production, lyrics and instrumental ""tightness""
    without detailing the first time I heard the band's song drifting from bowling alley in Poland or whatever
    confounds me.  More power to those who discover new music from this site.  I've figured out where I stand
    at this point, as have the readers.  Like the Beastie Boys, I could continue to crank out divisive pieces
    of writing here until I go gray.  I have more interesting stories to tell.</p></div>"|608.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/608-to-the-5-boroughs/|7.9|Brent DiCrescenzo

But then, it's been a steady     trajectory.  As Gerrard and Brendan Perry became more accomplished over time and more deeply immersed     themselves in the possibilities of ancient music, they left behind any semblance of ""rock.""  Eventually,     film soundtracks seemed a logical next step.  Gerrard has scored some good ones since the duo split in     1998 (<i>The Insider</i> comes immediately to mind), in addition to continuing with her solo and     collaborative work.</p>
<p><i>Immortal Memory</i> finds Gerrard working with Irish composer Patrick Cassidy to craft an epic, sweeping     cycle of songs that's completely over the top-- usually in the best possible way.  Most of the music comes     from a mid-size section of sampled strings (impressive in their fidelity) backing Gerrard's voice.  The     arrangements are obviously suggestive of a film score, but the pieces are complete in themselves, with     the kind of development not allowed by a series of cues.</p>
<p>It's a religious album, certainly, with themes as old as civilization.  Pieces like ""Maranatha (Come Lord)""     and ""Abwoon (Our Father)"" bear a resemblance to monastic chants and have the ambience of a medieval church.     Lyrics, when present, are often drawn from poems and early texts.  Those songs not executed with patented     4AD wordlessness are sung in ancient Gaelic or Aramaic, reinforcing Gerrard's aesthetic connection to the     idea of a collective unconscious, where memories and symbolic understanding are handed down through     generations.</p>
<p>Of course, the power of <i>Immortal Memory</i> ultimately comes from Gerrard's voice, and here, she is like     five great singers rolled into one, shaping her tone and elocution to fit seamlessly with the mood and style     of each individual piece.  Apparently, her control and authority are only increasing with age; her voice     goes wherever it's needed.  On both ""Abwoon (Our Father)"" and ""I Asked for Love"", she drops an octave and     sounds a hundred years old, hitting deep notes with a command suggestive of Diamanda Galas' virtuosity.     ""Elegy"" is the other end of the tonal spectrum, as Gerrard voices the swooning, more modern and almost     sentimental ballad with her clarion alto.  Sometimes it's almost hard to believe how well-suited her     instrument is for this kind of music.  She was born into it.</p>
<p>Because ethereal vocal music from ancient sources has been a fad a few different times over the last 15     years, <i>Immortal Memory</i> can at first listen feel a tad familiar.  Those who recoil at the very thought     of Enya, for example, might find this album rough going.  Upon closer inspection, though, <i>Immortal Memory</i> reveals itself to be among the best of its kind.  These two composers have a dangerously intuitive grasp of     the relationship between sound and emotion.  If, like me, you have a weakness for crushing gothic sadness     with a symphonic bent, it's as if Gerrard and Cassidy have The Bomb and we're dependent on their benevolence.     <i>Immortal Memory</i> is a slow, gradually unfolding album at the apex of melodrama, constantly one mislaid     note from being ""too depressing"" to pull out in any but the most desperate moments.  Fortunately, it never     quite crosses that line; befitting any art derived from the sacred, rays of light find their way into dark     corners.</p></div>"|3427.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3427-immortal-memory/|7.8|Mark Richardson

His demure baritone can be the perfect accomplice
    for a gray day or it can block out the sun, stanching a cheerful mood.  1996's <i>Everything I Long For</i>
    and 1998's <i>The Closer I Get</i> are volatile collections of snarling lo-fi folk-rock, often overwhelming
    sad or bitter, while 2001's <i>Skyscraper National Park</i> saw a subdued, significantly matured Hayden,
    one who seemed more comfortable in his own skin but was no less emotionally ponderous.  His fourth LP,
    <i>Elk-Lake Serenade</i> is his most low-key release yet: Here, Hayden seems to have recoiled still further
    into introversion, and as a result, has mollified some of the sentimental TNT displayed on recent songs
    such as <i>Skyscraper</i>'s ""Dynamite Walls"".</p><p>
<i>Elk-Lake</i> relies mainly on acoustic guitar and trembling vocals.  Periodic string and harmonica
    swells, a few instances of electric guitar, and the infrequent appearance of drums punctuate the sparse
    arrangements, but much of the record is vast and open, yet wrapped in solitude. Working with such a minimal
    palette, Hayden's arrangements seem less sophisticated and less effective here than they have on his
    previous releases.</p><p>
    
    The towering, string-heavy ""Wide Eyes"" is a misleading opener.  Short and stylistically different than
    much of the rest of the album, it features Hayden in top vocal form, gently wrapping his words around a
    meandering piano melody.  It serves as a nice preamble for the more representative ""Home by Saturday"".
    Here, Hayden presents hushed, slightly slurred vocals over a simplistic arrangement of acoustic guitar,
    plodding drums and twangy pedal steel.</p><p>
    
    From this point, much of <i>Elk-Lake</i> acquiesces as Hayden delves into saturnine, sawdust-covered folk
    songs that are almost <i>too</i> quiet.  Either you'll be enthralled by his underplayed persona or drift
    aimlessly and inattentively away from his soporific compositions.  ""This Summer"" and ""Robbed Blind"" are
    pleasant lullabies, but suffer from the opaqueness of Hayden's voice.  With a clearer, more gripping vocal
    (something Hayden proves himself capable of achieving on ""Woody""), those tracks would be captivating
    instead of frustratingly retiring.</p><p>
    
    What made <i>Skyscraper National Park</i> so affecting was the way its lo-fi boundaries often felt cleverly
    feigned to allow Hayden's laments to spill over into sincere emotional outpouring. <i>Elk-Lake Serenade</i>
    offers little of that suspense, and as such, it's too easy to tune out. <i>Elk-Lake</i> is a benign, restful
    listen, showing a once-unwieldy, always-vibrant creative mind having found a peaceful medium.  While it's
    easy to appreciate the man's development, this blunted songwriting is somewhat less resonant-- and seems
    somehow less Hayden.</p></div>"|3776.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3776-elk-lake-serenade/|6.8|Sam Ubl

    of all human experience on earth.  The Secret Chiefs influence us all, either directly or indirectly,
    through their representatives on earth, who are parts of the all and of the Great Movement of Things.""</i><br/>
           --David Cherubim, <i>The Golden Dawn and the Secret Chiefs</i></p><p>
<i>Nothing is true, everything is permitted.</i><br/>
           --Hassan-i-Sabbah</p><p>
    
    Legend has it that 11th Century Persian sheikh Hassan-i-Sabbah inspired fanatic, even suicidal, devotion
    from his legions.  His method of initiation was to kidnap and drug his foes' fiercest soldiers, then bring
    them to his fully functioning Garden of Earthly Delights, which was complete with exotic delicacies,
    fountains of wine, and good-to-go virgins.  When his captives came to, dazed and suggestible in their
    psychedelic stupors, they were told they had died and entered heaven.  Sabbah had only to promise that
    each of his subjects would return to Paradise if fortunate enough to martyr himself in his service.  For
    a century, Sabbah's <i>Hashishim</i>-- ""Hash Eaters,"" from which we derive the word assassin-- were the
    most feared killers in the known world.</p><p>
    
    It seems that Sabbah and Trey Spruance have something in common.  Spruance, Secret Chiefs 3's chief composer
    and a former guitarist for Mr. Bungle, is a visionary madman capable of instilling both fear and respect in
    his listeners.  Secret Chiefs 3 have existed in various incarnations over the course of the past eight years,
    and have served as the funnel for Spruance's remarkably far-flung studies of the hermetic mysteries and
    musical traditions of unknown and underappreciated subgenres.  Album titles like <i>Grand Constitution and
    Bylaws</i> and <i>Book M</i> hint at the music's vaguely metaphysical bent. Over three years in the making,
    <i>Book of Horizons</i> is Secret Chiefs' most expansive and coherent statement, an alchemical fusion of
    Morricone-esque cinematic grandeur, midnight surf guitar, traditional Middle Eastern rhythms and time
    signatures, demonic death metal, and electronic deviance that yields a work of undeniable force.</p><p>
    
    The album seems to develop a more acute, galloping schizophrenia as it progresses.  The opening quartet of
    tunes-- each attributed to a different sub-group of Chiefs-- moves from solemn to wanton: ""The End Times"",
    with plaintive bowed saw and string section, moves to the black-market Bollywood funk of ""The 4"" by Ishraqiyun,
    which, after a brief, eerie dub interlude, bleeds into to the brutal screamfest ""Exterminating Angel"" by
    the Holy Vehm.  Though the variance is great between the songs, each stays within the format of its genre.</p><p>
    
    That respect to structure unravels quickly and intoxicatingly in the album's midsection.  As the cast of
    players rotates, so do the names of the ensembles-- a narrative touch that lends <i>Book of Horizons</i>
    an epic feel. Common threads like copious strings and exotic percussion provided by William Winant (Thurston
    Moore's go-to skins man), Shazad Ismaily (Brian Eno, Elysian Fields), and Phil Franklin (Sunburned Hand of
    the Man) maintain some semblance of order.  By the time ""The Owl in Daylight"" appears-- sweeping from creepy
    electro grind to soothing acoustic guitar and chimes-- and the hallucinatory beachfront kasbah groove of
    ""On the Wings of Haoma"" by The Electromagnetic Azoth takes flight, unpredictability has taken the reins.
    Potentially the album's pivot point, UR's ""Book T: Exodus"" is a remake of the <i>Exodus</i> movie theme,
    incorporating immense string and horn ensembles created purely through meticulous overdubs.  It's a gorgeously
    orchestrated moment that wouldn't be out of place in the closing credits of a 1970s <i>Godzilla</i> flick.</p><p>
    
    As the album nears its close, two of the final pieces move through so many styles that trying to peg them
    all would be impossible.  The titles speak for themselves: ""DJ Revisionist (The Spin Masta, Kultur Killa,
    with da Mad Crypto-Colonial Skillz)"" and ""Anthropomorphosis: Boxleitner"" are exercises in new wave Middle
    Eastern electro freak lullaby majesty.  This is the kind of music that really must be heard to be understood,
    bound by a surreal logic both ridiculous and unforced; a true accomplishment, indeed.</p><p>
    
    Whether or not Spruance and his Secret Chiefs 3 are the intermediaries between heaven and earth is, um, hard
    to say, but with <i>Book of Horizons</i> it seems they're certainly communing with a power beyond the merely
    human.  Virtuosity, paired with a fearless love of divergent styles and the humor and talent to skillfully,
    unmercifully mash them up, pushes this album into rarified heights.  Bungle's major label connections and
    early association with John Zorn have given them a mainstream exposure that Secret Chiefs 3 will probably
    never receive.  But Spruance's mongoloid baby is a golden child, effortlessly balancing aplomb, apocalypse
    and apoplexy to create a truly daring, mystifying journey.</p></div>"|7763.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7763-book-of-horizons/|8.2|Jonathan Zwickel

    debut proclaim ""Produced by DFA!"" in 48 pt font.  Not to diminish the growing sales value of the DFA brand
    name, but the publicity angle seems a clumsy effort to avoid scaring off the hiphop-shy, as cynical as
    hyping their use of live instrumentation so that their audience doesn't have to rescind their ""rap is
    nothing but samples and talking"" arguments.  Still, the idea of the men behind The Rapture's curtain
    tuning their antennas to supervising beats of a different nature tingles some curiosity, if not without
    a hefty side-dish of skepticism.</p><p>
    Indeed, there are lessons to be learned from Automato's debut, the foremost being that the golden touch of
    Mssrs. Murphy and Goldsworthy can't save a band from their own indie-rap dullness, horrible cybernetic-produce
    bandname, and absolutely atrocious MC.  Given the consistent failing of history-fetishizing underground
    hip-hop to remember the genre's dance music ancestry, one might think that the DFA have the perfect resume
    to inject a little discoball back into this hangdog scene.  But the duo seems mostly content to leave
    Automato's music sopping in echo, doing little to disguise the fact that-- surprise!-- real genuine
    instruments are not, in and of themselves, a virtue.</p><p>
    Nevertheless, had the instruments been the only thing making noise in Automato, the album would be a
    sporadically interesting, if Iowa-flat affair.  ""Capes Billowing"" sounds a bit like M83 mashed up with
    ""Airbag"", while the jammed-out coda to ""Hope"" resembles a minor-league ""Yeah"" (via LCD Soundsystem, of
    course, not Lil Jon).  For the most part, the band's background vamp is intricate, featuring layers of
    keyboard minuets, staccato guitar, and multi-textured drums, but devoid of fun in favor of atmospherics.
    Despite announcing ""if it ain't soul music, then it ain't my music,"" Automato are distinctly lacking in
    that elusive thump.</p><p>
    Gagging at the lyric excerpt in the last sentence?  Well, that's only a taste of what MC Jesse Levine has
    in store for you fronting this sextet.  Since my keyboard's quotation mark key can only handle so much
    derisive use, here's a quick sampling of some other choice tidbits, in quiz form:</p><p>
    Q: Which of the following was not penned by Levine, but rather by my 12-year-old nephew?</p><p>
    A) ""If you see a chair sit in it/ If you see a bear don't hit it.""<br/>
    B) ""My Casio never told me there'd be times like these.""<br/>
    C) You don't appreciate people 'til they die/ Then you wonder why you never smiled when they're alive.""<br/>
    D) MTV generation/ Can't focus my attention.""</p><p>
    It's a trick question; I don't have a 12-year-old nephew.  All are Levine originals, and what's worse,
    they're all <i>hooks</i>, meaning these lines don't slip by once or twice, but are repeated and recited
    like Hail Marys.  To Levine's credit, he does have an ear for crafting a catchy rap melody, although it's
    hard to judge whether that's a good thing when faced with the indie hip-hop cliché-bingo chorus of ""Cool
    Boots"": ""All I ever wanted was truth, peace, harmony and anti-gravitational boots.""</p><p>
    The weird piano chording beneath the chorus of ""Cool Boots"" help make the song especially unshakeable, and
    hippie Trekkie lyrics aside, the song is revealing of how the Automato formula is not without its potential.
    So it's almost more disappointing that the DFA couldn't blow that spark into a bonfire, taking the same
    cattle prod to the mopey ass of indie hip-hop that they've recently used on shoegazing frown-rock.  On the
    evidence provided by Automato's debut, Jay-Z won't be ringing up Goldworthy &amp; Murphy anytime soon, and no
    hip-hop fan who doesn't know the liner notes of <i>Echoes</i> will or should bother with the band's music.</p></div>"|446.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/446-automato/|3.5|Rob Mitchum

    the Beggar Boys</i>, before launching into a garish, grating, noisy, psychedelic guitar solo that's completely
    out of sync with the song's trippily organic pop.  It's a mercifully short sojourn-- only a few measures--
    and the only thing that keeps it from completely derailing the song is Reiger's pleasant call-and-response
    with special guest Vic Chesnutt.  That outlandish break in the song, however, is symptomatic of Elf Power's
    new dilemma: whether to move forward with a brighter, more streamlined sound that incorporates 70s-style
    rock, or to hang on to the Elephant 6 lo-fi of previous albums like <i>A Dream in Sound</i> and <i>When the
    Red King Comes</i>.  The band's decision: to attempt to split the difference, a resolution that begets a
    cluttered, sometimes unfocused result.</p><p>
    
    Like their Elephant 6 siblings Olivia Tremor Control, Elf Power have always played with sounds: Their songs
    sometimes veer into cacophonous digressions or whimsically switch genres like bored children.  This
    off-the-cuff approach lent albums like <i>A Dream in Sound</i> an appropriately dreamlike quality, and
    was intrinsic to the group's shaggy-haired pop, which seemed to thrive on such capriciousness.  However,
    in updating their approach, Elf Power can't make the sonics match up to the songs, and as such, all these
    elements can do is intrude and interrupt.  The folksy verses of ""Drawing Flies"" don't quite jibe with the
    metal chorus of fuzzed-over uh-huh's and oh-oh's, and ""The Cracks"", with its murky programmed drums and
    deathly tone, mires the album's middle with its drudgy dirge.</p><p>
    
    It doesn't help that <i>Walking with the Beggar Boys</i> isn't the band's best collection of tunes.  The
    most striking melody here, on ""Evil Eye"", is snatched from Richard Thompson's ""Wall of Death"", and few
    others are very memorable.  An ambitious songwriter, Rieger still flirts with high-minded tedium, often
    dragging out hazy metaphors or vague motifs over several verses, if not through entire songs.  ""The Stranger""
    hinges on a lucid-dream account of meeting ""a stranger who stopped me in the street/ He told me love was in
    his head and then he ceased to be/ Yeah, when I looked the other way he'd split himself in two.""  Unless
    you're a paid psychoanalyst, listening to other people describe their dreams, as the saying goes, is
    wearisome.</p><p>
<i>Walking with the Beggar Boys</i> sounds askew, a puzzle whose pieces don't fit properly.  This sort of
    disjointedness can sometimes make for intriguing work, but here it just feels obligatory and slightly
    stunted.  Obviously, Elf Power intend <i>Walking with the Beggar Boys</i> to be their <i>Isolation Drills</i>:
    the step from lo- to hi-fi, a means to develop a slightly new sound and secure a bit of career longevity.
    Such aims are understandable and even admirable, but it's a difficult to walk with anyone who has one foot
    so firmly planted in the past.</p></div>"|2747.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2747-walking-with-the-beggar-boys/|5.7|Stephen M. Deusner

You might also know Ratkje from her exceptional 2002 solo album <i>Voice</i>, on which she     demonstrated how the bizarre fury of a woman scorned could produce as intimidating, recklessly creative     storm as any force in nature.  Only, she didn't actually <i>seem</i> scorned; her solo work, and that with     Fe-Mail, can be abrasive, but in general seems more the work of someone who takes more than a little pride     in fucking with people.  The duo's music, represented on 2003's <i>Syklubb fra Hælvete</i> and the new <i>All     Men Are Pigs</i>, can seem an exercise in pushing buttons-- and not necessarily just the electronic kind.     Apparently, Fe-Mail want to see just how far they can lead me into a semi-chaotic world, daring me to lean     in closer so they can pounce with industrial loops and howling electronic screams.</p>
<p>Surprising, then, to discover that their brand of noise (Merzbow is a better point of reference than any of     their peers at Rune Grammofon) is so fetching.  Living up to the questionable pun of their moniker, Fe-Mail     delight in using images of female sexuality and glamour to contrast the iron-fisted free terror of their     music.  They pose as calendar models on their album covers-- or use Rik Rawling's lurid cartoons fusing     softcore porn with heavy artillery-- and seem only too happy to exploit their rather attractive competitive     advantage.  I get the feeling they're trying to tell me something, too, be it an ironic statement about     improvised noise music, or just a kiss-off to all the hipster chauvinists of the world.  Regardless of the     concept, <i>Syklubb</i> and <i>All Men</i> deliver on purely musical fronts in spades, so you don't need     to feel very guilty for having a nagging urge to stare at the CD jackets.</p>
<p><i>Syklubb</i> was originally released in an edition of 500 on pink vinyl in Norway last year.  The Important     Records CD reissue contains two tracks not on the original, ""Virus Attachment 1"" and ""Virus Attachment 2"".     These pieces foreshadow the near-violent thrust of <i>All Men</i>, and are in considerable contrast with     much of <i>Syklubb</i>.  The former begins with a brief exposition of birdsong, but soon initiates a loop     of cut-up, high-pitched vocals and distorted percussion.  The sound is not unlike recent outings by New     York's Black Dice, using metallic, muscular sounds to construct highly detailed noisescapes.  ""Jacob's     Toy"" is much less confrontational: Atmospheric ambience, provided by who knows what analog synthesizer or     manipulated field recording, sets up a mildly disorientating vocal section that alternates spoken word with     wildly altered screams and laughs.  Fe-Mail use the human voice as source material rather than a lead     instrument, though it invariably lends acoustic warmth to their music.</p>
<p>Since much of Fe-Mail's music is improvised, it's not surprising to hear it run through several seemingly     unrelated textures within a piece.  ""Water Music"" is the calmest track on <i>Syklubb</i>, but even with     layers of natural ambience and water effects, the sine tones and suffocating vocal loop (not to mention     spooky, discordant piano) lends it a disturbing quality.  Likewise, ""Modogin"" begins as relatively low-key     exercise in electro-acoustic minimalism, using what sounds like sandpaper and a plaintive, wordless vocal     melody to orchestrate a damaged aria.  However, the uneasy peace is broken with a gurgling generator in     the left speaker, and a jagged, ferocious roar in the right.  And ""jagged"" seems like the right word for     Fe-Mail; a topographical diagram of their music would return severe spikes in mood, texture and volume.</p>
<p><i>All Men Are Pigs</i> was recorded with photographer and noise musician Lasse Marhaug, and serves as a     pretty good ""fuck you"" to anyone expecting shyer music.  If <i>Syklubb</i> had been a study in varying     shades of noise, this one is outright terror.  Grating, overdriven fuzz swirls through pieces that mix     bits of sampled metal guitar and radio static into a single, continuous strip of blades.  Rarely, as on     ""Here's That Rainy Day, Sid Hendrix' Last Grunt"", the storm subsides into smaller pockets, though most of     <i>All Men</i> seems designed to push listeners accustomed to ""lighter"" structures to their breaking points.</p>
<p>Of course, this is what makes <i>All Men</i> such a captivating listen.  Rather than milk the fury until it     no longer has any impact, Fe-Mail know just when to say ""when,"" and how to frame chaos in the barest skeleton     so as to suggest that what is happening isn't strictly chaotic, but a spiky, ill-tempered tone poem.  The     surreal, nightmarish collages at the outset of ""Charmed"" seem to logically prepare me for the paranoid     apocalypse of its conclusion; the future-jungle calls of ""Fresh from the Flesh, On a Bed of Roses"" sound     like perfect foils for its percussive gearshift loop and maniacal guitar.  During a time when many noise     and electronic musicians are downsizing to laptops and minimal improvisation, it's refreshing to hear an     outfit that has little-to-no appreciation for respectable expectations.</p></div>"|11745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11745-syklubb-fra-hlvete-all-men-are-pigs/|7.7|Dominique Leone

These pieces foreshadow the near-violent thrust of <i>All Men</i>, and are in considerable contrast with     much of <i>Syklubb</i>.  The former begins with a brief exposition of birdsong, but soon initiates a loop     of cut-up, high-pitched vocals and distorted percussion.  The sound is not unlike recent outings by New     York's Black Dice, using metallic, muscular sounds to construct highly detailed noisescapes.  ""Jacob's     Toy"" is much less confrontational: Atmospheric ambience, provided by who knows what analog synthesizer or     manipulated field recording, sets up a mildly disorientating vocal section that alternates spoken word with     wildly altered screams and laughs.  Fe-Mail use the human voice as source material rather than a lead     instrument, though it invariably lends acoustic warmth to their music.</p>
<p>Since much of Fe-Mail's music is improvised, it's not surprising to hear it run through several seemingly     unrelated textures within a piece.  ""Water Music"" is the calmest track on <i>Syklubb</i>, but even with     layers of natural ambience and water effects, the sine tones and suffocating vocal loop (not to mention     spooky, discordant piano) lends it a disturbing quality.  Likewise, ""Modogin"" begins as relatively low-key     exercise in electro-acoustic minimalism, using what sounds like sandpaper and a plaintive, wordless vocal     melody to orchestrate a damaged aria.  However, the uneasy peace is broken with a gurgling generator in     the left speaker, and a jagged, ferocious roar in the right.  And ""jagged"" seems like the right word for     Fe-Mail; a topographical diagram of their music would return severe spikes in mood, texture and volume.</p>
<p><i>All Men Are Pigs</i> was recorded with photographer and noise musician Lasse Marhaug, and serves as a     pretty good ""fuck you"" to anyone expecting shyer music.  If <i>Syklubb</i> had been a study in varying     shades of noise, this one is outright terror.  Grating, overdriven fuzz swirls through pieces that mix     bits of sampled metal guitar and radio static into a single, continuous strip of blades.  Rarely, as on     ""Here's That Rainy Day, Sid Hendrix' Last Grunt"", the storm subsides into smaller pockets, though most of     <i>All Men</i> seems designed to push listeners accustomed to ""lighter"" structures to their breaking points.</p>
<p>Of course, this is what makes <i>All Men</i> such a captivating listen.  Rather than milk the fury until it     no longer has any impact, Fe-Mail know just when to say ""when,"" and how to frame chaos in the barest skeleton     so as to suggest that what is happening isn't strictly chaotic, but a spiky, ill-tempered tone poem.  The     surreal, nightmarish collages at the outset of ""Charmed"" seem to logically prepare me for the paranoid     apocalypse of its conclusion; the future-jungle calls of ""Fresh from the Flesh, On a Bed of Roses"" sound     like perfect foils for its percussive gearshift loop and maniacal guitar.  During a time when many noise     and electronic musicians are downsizing to laptops and minimal improvisation, it's refreshing to hear an     outfit that has little-to-no appreciation for respectable expectations.</p></div>"|11745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11745-syklubb-fra-hlvete-all-men-are-pigs/|8.1|Dominique Leone

    those bands to actively seek proximity to the group which they're being relentlessly compared.  When Chicago's
    Detachment Kit first got rolling, they sounded, to put it lightly, a lot like Les Savy Fav, and almost every
    review (my own included) of their fine debut, <i>They Raging. Quiet Army</i>, dropped the comparison in its
    first third.  As if to drive home the point, the album was released by Self Starter Foundation, which was
    also home to Les Savy Fav at the time.  And now, three years later, the Kit have hooked up with Les Savy
    Fav's own Frenchkiss Records for the follow-up.  This is almost too convenient for a critic looking for a
    quick angle (pay no attention to that man behind the curtain with the pitchfork)-- the review is practically
    written in advance by the circumstances.  Or so it would seem.</p><p>
    
    The only problem is that the Les Savy Fav comparison doesn't really stick anymore.  Instead, Detachment
    Kit have got all grown up on us, and kicked out a record whose spectrum ranges much wider than their debut.
    There's not a single track now that feels derivative of their once and present labelmates, and the band
    leavens its rhythms with dashes of hazy nighthawk balladeering.  And though their broader approach yields
    less consistent results than previously, the highs this time around are much higher, and the album more
    listenable as a whole.</p><p>
    
    The band's range is probably best exemplified by the best one-two punch on the album.  The propulsive,
    spastic ""Ted the Electric"", a fuzzy explosion of distorted vocals and trebly bass guitar that rockets by
    the less than two minutes plays a fine foil to ""Ricochet"", a simple, slow song adorned by Charlie Davis'
    clean-toned guitar melodies and melancholy verses.  Vocalist Ian Menard is at his most controlled and
    incisive on the first verse, singing, ""This city's a landslide/ It pushes you over,"" with casual grace.</p><p>
    
    ""Pill Cake"" is another early highlight, with its bouncy rhythms, loosely harmonized vocals and loopy,
    rollercoaster melody.  ""Music for Strobelights"" puts a nice spin on beat-driven post-punk in its first
    verse, laying out hushed vocals over a solid backbeat which is then harassed by counterrhythmic drum fills
    before the song finally slides into its weightless chorus.  The accordion and cello of ""Ice Queen"" heighten
    the dread of the minor-key arrangement, helping to elevate the song to one of the band's finest.</p><p>
    
    Diversification is not without its pitfalls, however, and a few songs suffer.  ""Chronology"" is aimless and
    even a bit obnoxious for its first half, only finding its center of gravity when a guest vocalist referred
    to in the liners as the Thin Man picks up the verse, and ""The Race"" grinds a little too hard at nothing.
    Luckily, missteps like these are refreshingly few and far between.</p><p>
    
    One thing I should mention is that <i>Of This Blood...</i> is a fine discovery in my ongoing quest for
    superlative liner notes, as it features a corking board game on the inside of the fold, in which a roll
    is determined by setting your CD player to random and hitting the skip button.  Ultimately, it's distinctive
    touches like these that will help to define Detachment Kit on their own terms, as they've now taken their
    first broad step away from being defined on Les Savy Fav's.  <i>Of This Blood...</i> brings the band into
    their own, and realizes much of their old potential.</p></div>"|2296.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2296-of-this-blood/|7.3|Joe Tangari

    fantastic live shows and fun self-titled release, the men of the group-- Jason Holstrom, Johnny Rock, Noah
    Weaver, and Peter Sali-- also perform as Wonderful, and their debut, <i>God Bless Our Pad</i>, offers lush
    dream-pop in the vein of The Flaming Lips, Cocteau Twins, and perhaps a more piano- and synth-centric
    Elephant 6.  The album is for the most part uncompelling, but Wonderful's best moments here are in fact
    quite good, boasting the band members' abilities to write equally compelling dance and rock songs.</p><p>
    
    To Wonderful's credit, their songs are bristling with ideas.  Perhaps from their U.S.E. tenure, the band
    seems to feel some sort of heightened responsibility to build and collapse these ideas with sub-radar
    subtlety and even some seriously high-contrast changes of face.  Here's the thing, though: While, to an
    extent, U.S.E. can martial its sugary melodic fixations with the discipline of a big obnoxious dance beat,
    Wonderful both succeeds and fails precisely because its bright buxom sound is not kept in check.  Piano
    replaces guitar almost entirely here, drummer Johnny Rock is pushed way back into the mix, vocalists take
    turns at falsetto, and on many songs, there's hardly any discernible low-end.</p><p>
    
    Couple these issues with
    predictable vocal harmonies (some vocoded) and sinfully dominant synth flourishes, and some of these songs
    are cheesy trainwrecks just begging to be picked up by Lifetime channel dramas.  The harp-laden synth waltz
    schmaltz of ""Ana Paradisimo"", The vocoded Flaming Lips-gone-awry travesty ""Romance &amp; Freedom"", and the Xiu
    Xiu-does-weddings slobber of ""Hope Must Break You"" all fall victim to their own cliches and Wonderful's
    desperate attempts to emote.  Other tracks, like ""Pagoda"" and ""Baby Boy Blue"", pleasantly flirt with the
    late Elliott Smith's bouncier catalog.  But meanwhile, ""Golden Rays"" might be a little too Beach Boys for
    even the Beach Boys, and unless strict attention is paid, ""My How You Come Alive!"" can sound exactly like
    the theme song to <i>Three's Company</i>.</p><p>
    
    All of which is a shame, since Wonderful absolutely nail a few songs here.  These few seem to share their
    success from simple recourse to lazy melody and contrasting, high-energy rhythmic figures.  Opener ""Adrianne""
    is about par for <i>God Bless Our Pad</i> in this respect: Vocal melodies and saxophone harmonies soar atop
    a rhythm section banging out a tempo proceeding four times as fast, while with each movement the piano
    waxes nostalgic for the song's earlier moments.  ""Call Me Sunshine"" is the album's best: Drums and bells
    start upbeat and stay there, providing firm ground for the song's cumulus mantra, ""Call me sunshine/ Be
    my sunshine,"" and some intermittent hot-rodding on the bass to break from otherwise languor.  The sheer
    performance energy on ""Adrianne"" and ""Call Me Sunshine"" could easily keep Wonderful as relevant as U.S.E.--
    if they find a way to further capitalize on this energy, and depart from their willed submission to the
    tired sounds and musical cliche that riddle <i>God Bless Our Pad</i>.</p></div>"|8776.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8776-god-bless-our-pad/|4.4|Nick Sylvester

    from their groggy eyes, and bagging birds at a staggering rate.  They're plug-in comers to the Brit-Pop
    oracle, though they claim no allegiance to the genre, and have as much Blur in their britches as they do
    crusty Levellers.  Operators like The Mountaineers, The Beta Band, we're talking about here; Super Furry
    Animals, too, those wacko Welshmen who nimbly sidestep failure while spending too much money.  And now
    Athlete comes walking down the same meandering trail with <i>Vehicles &amp; Animals</i>, a full-length cobbled
    in part from past singles and EPs.</p><p>
    
    As evidenced by this debut, Athlete enjoy removing the connective tissue in a song, so that Joel Pott's
    drowsy, accented Malkmus impersonation can flap untethered over slippery guitar hooks and assorted electronic
    splooge.  ""One Million""'s rhythms shift suddenly from loping organic percussion into a programmed static
    bump; ""Beautiful"" flits between clicky, pocket-size verses and big soaring choruses, and treats the whole
    lot with a recording of <i>Wish You Were Here</i> played backwards.</p><p>
    
    Of course, America has its own crazy diamonds, and Athlete's heard <i>them</i>, too.  Their heads bob to
    the established tenets of the American indie electronica movement, as well as <i>Soft Bulletin</i>
    psychedelia.  ""You Got the Style"" happily references softly doting rock chorusing, the slickness of 80s
    English pop, and that country's fickle climate, while ""Salvador"" is an inviting opening singalong of chiming
    guitars and natty scarves blowing fancily in a gentle breeze.  The latter is also the closest approximation
    of what no one's been waiting for, but most everyone will secretly love-- a Super Furries-style cover of
    Avril Lavigne's ""Complicated"".</p><p>
    
    ""Everybody wants to be part of the rock scene,"" Pott declares in ""Westside"", and there he is, defending
    <i>Vehicles</i>' more blatant appropriations.  But perhaps he drifts into daydream then, and peers into
    his neighbor's ear: ""You raise the tempo in the disco/ As you make this place your own.""  It's the sort
    of line that gets paunchy Bridget Jones types and the moon-faced men that love them very excited, because
    it invites everyone to the arty party.  In fact, most of the album does, remaining fashionably idiosyncratic
    even as it keeps the accessibility altimeter level on the horizon; for all its pristinely damaged production
    and implications of music fan snobbery, ""Shake Those Windows"" is close to the pink-palmed mainstream pop of
    Stereophonics.</p><p>
    
    Maybe the band knew we'd be growing tired with them by mid-album, and looking for a reason to hate, since
    the midpoint title track really yanks the space hippie heartstrings.  ""There are moments of escape for every
    one of us/ And the beauty in the times that we create,"" Pott whispers over xylophone tinkles, and relates
    the album's title as a child's artistic escape from loneliness, and perhaps abuse.  Simplistic and blatant,
    but full of meaning over the modified lullaby arrangement, the track accesses the warm/fuzzy humanism of
    Wayne Coyne.</p><p>
    
    The feelings conveyed are certainly real, but the organi-tronic flower power flow on display
    here is hardly unique to Athlete.  It's actually preached by most of the band's UK USB hippie peer group
    (all of whom must count Coyne an earthly saint).  It's all about finding the friendly turtles at the end
    of the druggy rainbow, yet, since no one's in a hurry to get there, the songs loop along with space between
    the beats and guitarists who still seem to be learning their craft.  ""Give it up/ Lift your hands/ Everybody,""
    Athlete urges at the end of <i>Vehicles &amp; Animals</i>, and there's a good chance we will, at least until
    the next batch of happy pills fall from the fluffy clouds.  Look, kids, a centaur with a laptop!</p></div>"|444.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/444-vehicles-animals/|6.4|Johnny Loftus

    Skid's <i>Friends4Ever</i> and Hip Hop Wieners' <i>All Beef, No Chicken</i> underground favorites.  A
    sophomore effort and the return of the label's vanguard, Pipi Skid's <i>Funny Farm</i> is a slightly darker
    affair than might've been expected from a traditionally comical group of artists.</p><p>
    
    First off, Pipi Skid's style of rap is incredibly idiosyncratic.  To make a simple comparison, he comes off
    like The Streets if Mike Skinner was Canadian, grounded in hip-hop traditions (mid-90s sound, emphasis on
    scratching, references to old-school favorites), and actually focused on his flow.  Pipi raps with a gravelly
    voice, but it doesn't impede his accessibility like it might for Buck 65 or Aesop Rock.  And if some rap
    purists may not take to it, Pipi's decidedly pedestrian subject matter (working at an old folks' home,
    dependence on alcohol, germ phobia, pawning off his shit for quick cash) is a big part of his charm.</p><p>
    
    ""Pip Skizzy"" best exemplifies the styles of both Pipi Skid and producer Mcenroe.  The backdrop hits with
    wavering Spanish guitar and repeating jazz hi-hats, while Pipi justifies murder (""You smell like McDonald's
    and Wal-Mart/ By killing you, I'm acting globally, doing a small part""), forced impotency (""While you listen
    to 'Rapture', I'ma rupture your nuts/ Blondie's singing and I'm swinging and you can't have no children""),
    and presidential assassination (""And now everybody scream/ As I mow down Bush and his security team""). The
    song sets the album's tone perfectly.</p><p>
    
    Produced entirely by Mcenroe, <i>Funny Farm</i> is oriented around strings and dusty drum funk.  From the
    looped sequence of tribal drums, orchestral horns, and flutes on the title track to the whimsical bounce,
    slow-release horn flourish, and gorgeous violin of ""Super Dope Producers"" to the glitchy double-time drums
    and wind chimes of ""Magnifique"", there's ample evidence of Mcenroe's traditional yet incredibly technical
    style. As is the case with most Peanuts &amp; Corn work, the production stands out over the lyrics without
    unbalancing the album too much.</p><p>
    
    In the end, though, the record does present something of a conflict: There are good ideas, excellent beats,
    and solid rapping all over this album, and Pipi Skid plays a highly likeable everyman character.  But Pipi's
    better at utilizing humor based on his life experiences and the underground hip-hop landscape than tackling
    <i>Funny Farm</i>'s more downtrodden topics.  I'd have preferred longer songs, too, as some of the shorter
    pieces, had they been expounded upon, might have improved the album as a whole.  Still, <i>Funny Farm</i>
    upholds P&amp;C;'s claim to relevance in today's independent hip-hop scene.</p></div>"|6541.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6541-funny-farm/|7.2|Rollie Pemberton

One by one, just about every established laptop artist has abused their
    popularity by breaking out into spontaneous song or rediscovering half a talent for, like, glockenspiel,
    and assuming we're interested.  What is this epidemic of narcissistic self-reference afflicting today's
    electro-auteur?  Is it a kind of masturbatory ego deconstruction?  Or simply an instinctive yearning for
    recognition as a ""proper"" musician and a reaction to the genre's perennial dismissal?</p><p>
    Whatever the answer, the results have ranged from challenging (Venetian Snares' operatic explorations) to
    confounding (overachiever Squarepusher's live bass and drumming showcase <i>Music Is Rotted One Note</i>)
    to downright weird (Bogdan Raczynski's creepy crooning on <i>My Love I Love</i>).  Despite the experimentation
    and progression of their Warp, Planet Mu, Skam, and Schematic peers, Andrew Weatherall and Keith Tenniswood
    had, to date, oozed a self-satisfied maturity and spurned the temptation to completely revamp their sound
    with each successive release.  That attitude engendered a seamless continuity of production; their tight,
    elaborate beats held together beautiful melodies ranging from staccato funk to underwater drone, cemented
    by techno sensibilities cultivated from years of industry experience.</p><p>
    But with <i>From the Double Gone Chapel</i>, Two Lone Swordsmen, among the most resilient and dependable
    purveyors of quality cerebral electro going, have attempted their own bewildering departure.  ""Stack-Up""'s
    freaky funk opens the album with a murky, ambivalent swell of synths that begets an instant unfamiliarity.
    Negotiating your expectations through this live-sounding hybrid makes for one disorienting experience.  It's
    truly unsettling hearing the usually dominant drum machines strangled and dwarfed by a threatening mix of
    feedback and gothic vocalizing reminiscent of The Sisters of Mercy and Mick Harvey's darker efforts.  On
    ""Faux"", Weatherall sings, ""She's like a tornadom"" in a flat, deep, bit-crushed voice that would sound at
    home on a Einstürzende Neubauten track-- and he keeps this up for pretty much the entire album.</p><p>
    Once the initial alarm subsides, the structures and rhythms reveal a certain cordiality.  The live drums,
    phased bass, and sparse guitar phrasing on the excellent ""Damp"" have no discernible heritage anywhere in
    the TLS catalog, yet there's something in the beat syncopation and smooth, serene strings that's intrinsically
    Weatherall/Tenniswood.</p><p>
    Since Weatherall's famed emergence as producer of Primal Scream's <i>Screamadelica</i>, he's had a hand in
    most areas of production, including a prolific DJ career and frequent remixing and board work for New Order,
    Saint Etienne, Beth Orton, and others.  So now he wants to sing.  Which is unfortunate, because Weatherall's
    not a particularly gifted vocalist, and some may find TLS's proven abstract approach preferable to his
    consistently bleak poetry: ""The alarm in his head/ Moving into the red/ And it sounded like punches and
    knives.""  The glutinous acid on ""Sick When We Kiss"" is deviant and suggestive enough without the seedy
    utterances; this preoccupation with loss, anger and bitterness sounds like nothing so much as Weatherall
    and Tenniswood jumping at the chance to address their repression directly.</p><p>
    A cover of Gun Club's ""Sex Beat"" hints at the duo's influences and ties the album's ideology together.  On
    much of <i>From the Double Gone Chapel</i>, punk, goth, and electronics exist in effective cohabitation, but
    some tracks are polarized strongly toward one genre or another.  The harmonized duet on ""Taste of Our Flames""
    eschews any semblance to prior TLS material, while ""The Valves"" is a stripped down, claustrophobic affair
    that might've happily graced 2000's astounding <i>Stay Down</i>.  Still, generally speaking, you'd have to
    go back as far as 1994 (to Weatherall's Sabres of Paradise LP <i>The Haunted Dancehall</i>) to find this
    new spawn's paternal gene pool.</p><p>
    Two Lone Swordsmen's new direction takes getting used to, and <i>From the Double Gone Chapel</i> isn't an
    easy first listen for longtime fans.  The contrasting styles don't always sit comfortably, but individual
    tracks sparkle with creativity and the newfound dark side is a surprisingly pleasant fit.  Raw and impulsive,
    <i>From the Double Gone Chapel</i>'s tattered edges do it justice.  Two Lone Swordsmen have successfully
    jerked their whole operation around, and they just about pull it off.  Having sat so long at the top of
    their game, Weatherall and Tenniswood can't be blamed for wanting to shake things up a bit-- and judging
    by this record, they're more than capable.</p></div>"|8227.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8227-from-the-double-gone-chapel/|7.9|Dan Lett

No vibrato divas spreading syrup between the sheets.  No luscious string
    sections, pitch-perfect harmonies, or funky drummer backbeat. Defined as much by what they aren't as what
    they are, John Wilkes Booze want you to understand that although modern soul is choked by formula, the
    real stuff is far more dangerous, intangible and important.</p><p>
    
    Pieced together from five first-take EPs released in 2002, <i>Five Pillars of Soul</i> canonizes five
    seemingly disparate icons-- Melvin Van Peebles, Patti Hearst, Albert Ayler, Marc Bolan, and Yoko Ono--
    who addled the status-quo with their singular vision and fuck-the-bullshit tenacity.  ""They have become
    a shining example for finding soul in ourselves by inspiring up to go beyond the limited mind, beyond
    fear and anger, to the core of what is true,"" reads the introduction to the liner notes.  You never
    figured six jittery acolytes from the Hoosier state could get so archly metaphysical, but that's one of
    the unlikely, ingenious aspects of this album.  <i>Five Pillars</i> forces a reconsideration of soul-- in
    music, in spirit, in art-- as a strong-willed DIY ethos and singularity of purpose.  In the skewed
    rock-as-art world of John Wilkes Booze, grandfather soul is not unlike his agitated, aggressive nephew,
    punk, ignoring convention and plowing headfirst into self-expression.</p><p>
    
    Skeptical? I don't blame you. But check out the 12 pages of liner notes-- these guys are serious. Because
    the chaotic musical thread doesn't overtly tie it all together neatly, they give a detailed, articulate
    dissertation on the mark the five left on America's cultural fabric. The more you read the more the
    concept gels. But listening to the album I'm still shaking my head: The sound doesn't necessarily speak
    directly to the thesis. All five pillars were revolutionary in some sense, and musically, it almost makes
    sense. But ultimately, John Wilkes Booze are a full-bore garage band caricature, which is good and bad.
    There's sweat and lust and ingenuity here, but it's nearly dwarfed by the concept itself.</p><p>
    
    Still, I can't help but dig it. Rock and roll rarely educates, and JWB's devotion to history occasionally
    surfaces in some clever ways. Seth Mahern's falsetto is itself a lesson, a helium-sucking Ray Davies cartoon,
    and it leads the band into unlikely hip-thrust territory despite its completely asexual ring. He squeaks
    out the requisite grunts and groans on the nearly-funky opener ""Sweetback's Gonna Make It"", while the
    gurgling organ that drives ""See Through Sound"" is all jagged vanilla Sly. These two odes to van Peebles
    come closest to straight-up soul, but also lean towards The Nation of Ulysses' rhythmic noise barrage.</p><p>
    
    Bolan is hardly the top of anyone's list of soul pioneers, but the psychedelic meandering on the vaguely
    medieval ""Butcher's Tale"", the piano-driven chant of ""Academy Flight Song"", and country blues of ""Marc
    Bolan Makes Me Want to Fuck"" adds interesting, unpredictable shades. Ayler makes a brief appearance on
    ""They Don't Like Me in this Town"", his sampled snippet leading into Eric Weddle's skronk sax before ripping
    into the chorus that sums up the album's overall theme: ""They don't like me in this town/ 'Cause I've got
    that outside sound."" The band's sense of humor shows up in the congruity of the title ""Meanwhile, At the
    Hideout"" and the song's content. It's an acoustic guitar and tambourine sing-along of the Symbionese
    Liberation Army motto (""Death to the fascist insects/ That prey on the lives of the people""), and recalls
    both Patti Hearst's schizoid radicalism and John and Yoko's ""Happy Christmas (War is Over)"".</p><p>
    
    No surprise the band was originally named John Wilkes Booze Explosion-- the pattern for this kind of
    post-rock black music tribute was first drawn by Jon Spencer ten years back.  That doesn't lessen the
    album's impact, though: Not many records inspire such profound analysis.  <i>Five Pillars</i> seems
    simultaneously random and pointed, visceral and intellectual, absurd and sensible.  Like <i>School House
    Rock</i> reborn through blood, guts and sweat.</p></div>"|4344.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4344-five-pillars-of-soul/|7.6|Jonathan Zwickel

Ghostface and Raekwon.  Andre and Big Boi.  Eazy and Dre.  Eminem and Dre.  The history
    of hip-hop is full of odd couples-- most often, the raving, paranoid madman and his wiser, more stern companion.
    Hell, even The Sugarhill Gang had Master Gee.  Hot-buttered a pop da pop dibbie dibble, my ass.  The
    Ultramagnetic MC's, however, were the first <i>all-lunatic</i> rap group, one that would straitjacket the
    way from Digital Underground to Company Flow.  If they offered anything truly innovative, it wasn't so much
    in their brilliantly swift, stilted flow or crushing rhythmic density as it was in the establishment of this
    unique dynamic.</p><p>
    
    To claim that <i>Critical Beatdown</i> is the greatest hip-hop album of 1988 would take a lot of courage--
    after all, it was the zenith of hip-hop's Golden Age, boasting classics from nearly every influential
    late-1980s rap group.  And even if Ultramagnetic's Kool Keith and Ced Gee didn't possess the intricate rhythms
    of Rakim and Chuck D, or paint vivid ghettoscapes as well as KRS-One or Slick Rick, <i>Critical Beatdown</i>
    is still probably the hardest, fastest, craziest hip-hop album of that year.</p><p>
<i>Critical Beatdown</i>'s surging psychosis is primarily due to its producers.  Ced Gee was one of the most respected,
    radical maestros of the era, devoting some of his energies to Boogie Down Productions' untouchable <i>Criminal
    Minded</i>.  DJ Moe Love was more interested in using the turntable's sounds than its samples', helping
    transform DJing into turntablism.  Never mind the chilling hisses and heckles or the charred slabs of
    swollen funk; <i>Beatdown</i> has as much screaming as the average punk or metal album.  Those screams, of
    course, are ingrained in the very fabric of the beat, concealed and crippled amidst the relentlessly fuzzing
    bass.  And like most great rap albums, many of them come from the patron saint of yelps, James Brown, and
    flurry and flux with such abstraction and chaos that they make the beats feel deceptively fast-paced.</p><p>
    
    Though many of these samples were standard-issue in the 1980s, they're arranged into patterns like split-second
    greatest-hits discs.  ""Ease Back"" never sounds particularly innovative, but the bruising conflict between
    The Meters' ""Look-Ka Py Py"" and the JBs' ""The Grunt"" justified the existence of sampling in an era in which
    to some it was still oddly despised.  On ""Ego Trippin'"", the beat is a mosaic of hacks and howls that sound
    as if they could suddenly disappear under the monstrous beat.  On ""Funky [Remix]"", the stratifications of
    snares and basses bring out some gentle, foreign incantations rhythmically chirped by buried female voices.
    On the record's best track, ""Ain't It Good to You"", the frantic, proto-drum-n-bass beat breaks into
    inebriated static and a core that sounds like every sample on the album searing into one another.</p><p>
    
    Kool Keith and Ced Gee's lyrics often seem as if they're not really about anything at all: The opening
    track asks the listener to do the one thing it's impossible to do to music-- ""Watch me now""-- and things
    don't get much more clear after that.  For instance, Keith's first verse begins, ""Uno dos not quarto/
    Spanish girls, they call me Pancho/ When on the mic, innovating this patterning,"" and ends, ""I'm in a
    movie scene/ Ears turn, and needles lean/ To cut scratches.""  On ""Ease Back"", he ""relates it verbal/
    Dissing a mouse and smacking any gerbil/ I bought a Saab, a 1990 Turbo.""  Keith could have wished for any
    future model, but he went for the Saab: Now that's lyrical ingenuity.  (In a recent <i>Mojo</i> interview,
    Keith reported that the MC's ""read a lot of <i>Popular Mechanics</i>""-- so perhaps that explains his
    predilection for sensible motoring.)</p><p>
    
    But despite Keith's reputation, Ced Gee is the source of the album's most insane, digitalk-quantum gibberish,
    spouting lines such as, ""A certified rhyme that I use, confuse, clock the time to a point/ A metaphysical
    radius,"" or, ""Using frequencies and data, I am approximate.""  Ced's rhymes are so ""approximate,"" in fact,
    that they should be studied in seminars alongside general relativity.  And despite his philosop-hop, he
    can still sound as tough as NWA, claiming, ""I will melt anyone who even tries to feel an emotion.""  That
    anti-sentiment sentiment sounds odd until we find out Ced is a robot: ""I'm like a merchandise, a customized
    item/ Computer rapper for ducks who wanna bite them.""</p><p>
    
    In a year that's already seen too many needless hip-hop reissues (from Nas to Non Phixion), <i>Critical
    Beatdown</i>'s six bonus tracks-- including many of the group's early singles-- are probably not worth
    seeking out unless you're a bit more ultramagnetic than the casual fan.  Those tracks are sparser and
    slower, and they feature group raps, an unhealthy amount of beatboxing and kind-hearted disco synths.  The
    original 12-inch of ""Chorus Line""-- with its punctured vocals and melodramatic reverb-- still has the faint
    residue of hyper-lunacy, even though Tim Dog is on the mic.  The classic ""Travelling at the Speed of Thought
    [Hip House Club Mix]"" is a frilled techno fiesta, and is the most mainstream thing Kool Keith has ever done.
    (And even then, it has a clarinet solo.)  For the initiated, though, the reissue sounds slightly crisper
    than the original, and the extras are nice additions to a flawless album-- one that stands tall today as
    one of Golden Age's most ageless.</p></div>"|8383.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8383-critical-beatdown/|9.7|Alex Linhardt

Among their luminaries, the Canucks can count a bilingual prime minister who speaks in full sentences, filmmaker Guy Maddin, and Vancouver's preeminent redheaded songwriter, Carl Newman, who has just released, by a stride, the best power-pop album of 2004.</p><p>  Newman worked through his more angular pop leanings in the mid-1990s with Sub Pop indie rockers Zumpano and is now the primary songwriter in The New Pornographers.  To place The Slow Wonder's aesthetics in terms that The New Pornographers fans will understand, these 11 tracks blend Mass Romantic's clipped frenetics, Electric Version's spacious tenderness, and the agile twists and turns of   Zumpano, effortlessly humbling all three.  On The Slow Wonder, the hooks crack apart and multiply, accruing additional catchiness the way the pumped muscles of a spinach-stuffed Popeye give birth to crops of testosterone-filled goose bumps.  At one point in ""Drink to Me Babe Then"", a languid group of whistlers double themselves harmoniously before a quavering electromagnetic guitar blazes overhead; elsewhere, a fading melodian shoots rubber bands at the stars.</p><p>  Taken as a single document, <em>The Slow Wonder</em> fits together for a taut 34 minutes without lags or rough spots; viewed as collection of singles, all but a couple tracks would justifiably fill the A-side of a seven-inch.  From the catchy drum-fill intro of ""Miracle Drug"" to ""35 in the Shade""'s soaring exit guitar, there's not a misfire to be found.  Time and time again, Newman showcases a quaint nostalgia and a layered sense of production that often feels similar to the inventive beauty that made The Shins' <em>Chutes Too Narrow</em> such a whopper of a sophomore release.  Like the exquisite chamber pop that Richard Davies and Eric Matthews showcased as Cardinal, these songs have a comfortable Kinks-like feel while still sporting their own unique, keenly crafted hooks.</p><p>  Throughout the album, Newman keeps the palette varied, cramming enough pop muscularity into his two- and three-minute blasts to infuse this genre with the life it possessed in its 70s heyday.  ""On the Table"" makes use of flourishing ragtime piano, a regal trumpet emerges from the fragile tambourine and deep percussion of ""The Cloud Prayer"", and ""The Town Halo""'s sinewy cello propels like a metallic fuzz bass with zero distortion.</p><p>  On ""Miracle Drug"", rat-a-tat surf drums gain momentum when interlaced with brazen rock guitar licks and a quirky storyline: ""He was tied to the bed with a miracle drug in one hand/ In the other, a great lost novel that, I understand, was returned with a stamp/ That said 'thank you for your interest, young man.'"" Instead of Neko Case's swooping country intonations and general high-end foil, Newman harmonizes here with Sarah Wheeler, who adds exultant punctuation to the track's ""So why all the history now?"" refrain.</p><p>  Not mere ear candy, <em>The Slow Wonder</em>'s playful, often surrealistic libretto riffs on guilt and innocence, victorious defeat, secret agents, boring rich kids, small-town saviors and the onset of revelations.  Newman's concerns rest more with relational discourse and struggles than bubblegum and flowers-- fitting for an artist whose press photos show him asleep with a copy of Foucault's <em>Power/Knowledge</em>.  Amid the hard/soft tidal wave of ""The Battle for Straight Time"", Newman chirps in staccato, ""O come sweet life, wash clean my hands/ The revolution has been left to chance/ This dawns on me every morning at about three.""</p><p>  Sounding a lot like a track by The New Pornographers, ""On the Table"" looks at justice as ""the deal between the thieves and exits.""  When ""Come Crash"", a seemingly pure and dark love ballad enters the picture, it's more a sleepy love story written by J.G. Ballard than the wimpy sentiments of feckless and freckled romantic: ""That's luck, she led, we should be dead/ We eyed the wreck. Good god, we said/ She plants one kiss, for the road, on my chest/ Sirens came after we left.""  In the Guided by Voices-inflected ""35 in the Shade""-- perhaps the album's most metaphorically charged track-- Newman plays with Cleopatra and magicians in order to win an argument, all the while trying not to miss his ride home from a bar.</p><p>  Although not much longer than an episode of <em>Small Wonder</em>, Newman has created a timeless document. These are soulful sing-alongs with grit, pop nuggets that hold up to hours of repeat play in humid bumper-to-bumper traffic, and ultimately, the sound of a great songwriter hitting his stride.</p><p> </p></div>"|5898.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5898-the-slow-wonder/|8.8|Brandon Stosuy

One is female.  The other is male.  The man,
    Joe Ziemba, plays guitar and writes most of the songs.  The woman, Amanda Ziemba, plays drums and sometimes
    sings.  Sharing a distinctive surname, they could either be siblings or spouses.  In fact, they're the
    latter.  They've shared a bill with The Von Bondies.</p><p>
    
    On paper, The Like Young resemble another popular, co-ed, two-member band of siblings/spouses with connections
    to Jason Stollsteimer's Motor City group, but the similarities end there.  While most of today's two-member
    bands, like The Black Keys and Mr. Airplane Man, seem to gravitate toward blues-based rock and, like sonneteers,
    find freedom in the limitations of their line-ups, the Ziembas never sound like just two people: they play
    tight power-pop as if they had an extra person or two.  In fact, they sound closer to The Spinanes than to
    The White Stripes, and closer still to twice-their-size groups like Weezer or Fountains of Wayne.</p><p>
    
    Tighter and more dynamic than last year's <i>Art Contest</i>, The Like Young's second album, <i>So Serious</i>, is
    dense with sound and noise, and not just because Joe overlays some songs with spacey keyboards and thumping
    bass.  In part thanks to former Coctail Barry Phipps' snappy production, Joe's guitar makes a really loud
    noise, and Amanda's drums crack like whips while she does double and triple duty as her husband's backup
    singer and verbal sparring partner.</p><p>
    
    None of which is to suggest that The Like Young aren't, in their own way, as elemental as any of the blues
    twos.  Clocking in at a mere 24 minutes, <i>So Serious</i> is all a-jumble with catchy guitars, hooky choruses,
    tight drumming, and backup vocals that never run out of new ways to sing ooh and aah.  However, The Like
    Young move from one idea to the next so quickly and frenetically that the catchiest parts are short-lived
    and rarely repeated more than once.  ""Sabine &amp; Me"" concludes with a propulsive start/stop jam that abruptly
    ends as soon as it reaches its momentum; the song's over in less than a minute and a half.</p><p>
    
    Nothing on the album sounds half-baked or underdeveloped, but there's more going on in the songs' brevity
    than a simple leave-'em-wanting-more aesthetic.  It takes several listens to grasp the guiding logic on <i>So
    Serious</i>, not just in how the songs progress but also in how the lyrics describe situations in language
    that sounds coded and private.  ""Big ape, why don't you sue them?"" Joe sings on ""Routines"".  ""Big ape,
    I'm giving up and laughing.""  On ""Sharp or Messy"", he observes, ""When my baby head was soft, thoughts like
    this were never thought,"" without clarifying what he's thinking.</p><p>
    
    The opacity of these lyrics is telling.  In the end, <i>So Serious</i> reveals itself generally and
    implicitly: These songs form a dialogue between a couple who share not just a household but a band.  The
    specifics, however, are between Joe and Amanda.  Fortunately, they create and sustain a flurry of restless,
    catchy pop energy that keeps listeners from feeling either incidental or voyeuristic and that gives them
    something to sing along with.</p></div>"|4966.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4966-so-serious/|7.8|Stephen M. Deusner

An artist with an existing portfolio can lose respect and prominence with the slightest shift in creative direction, while the new kids on the block are often held to high standards when compared to those who preceded them. In the case of ex-hardcore techno DJ Sharkey, his first foray into hip-hop fails not due to superficial comparative issues but because of his own mistakes, and lack of talent and consistency.</p><p>
    Hell, I'm not even sure the term ""instrumental"" really applies to this album, considering Sharkey only relies on his solo backdrops four times over the course of the album. This is an insecure approach, but it's for good reason: Sharkey has not grasped the concept of the change-up. Listening to roughly the same thing for four minutes at a time is not appealing, so as a long-form instrumental producer it's important to learn how to make beats with movements. Sharkey has some interesting sounds across the span of the album, but some of his sample work is far too poorly processed (sometimes it sounds as if he hasn't learned to equalize samples to create a distinctive sound for himself) and the artists he puts on top of his beats do not flatter him.</p><p>
    Among the guests is a slew of well-known artists, but don't let the big names fool you: They might be the only people more uninterested in this project than Sharkey himself. The highest profile collaboration is ""Fuzz"" with Cannibal Ox, and although the distorted synth is an interesting effect, Vast Aire settles for a pair of freestyles that reference <i>Jason X</i>, mechanical thongs (and bongs) and rhinestone baseball bats, while Vordul raps a combined 18 bars that offer nothing new other than the term ""rap ninjas.""</p><p>
    It doesn't get any better.  When Cherrywine (formerly of Digable Planets) spins an embarrassingly lame illicit conversation on ""Phone Sex"" (""We rock and roll, we like The Strokes"") and The Pharcyde (well, the members that aren't Fatlip or Slim Kid Tre) guest on the vanilla, acid-jazz coffee shop muzak of ""Snobird"". At the end of the day, the only person who seems to know the mic is on is Jean Grae, whose tightly delivered vision of a New York apocalypse on ""Summer in the City (Lovin' It)"" is the album's obvious highlight.</p><p>
    Believe me, the unknowns are exceedingly worse.  Zooks from the Spark and Billy Moon ape the Uncle Kracker rap-country formula (and actually don't even do it justice) on ""Little Cabin Song"". Zooks, who seems to be a Sharkey protégé of sorts, shits all over the place like a stray dog.  It isn't just his painfully suburban multi-syllabic style but his lyrics as well.  One chorus goes, ""I used to skate around the neighborhood/ But now I just jerk off on the internet/ RESPECT!"", with a female refrain of, ""No, man, no way, he don't wanna skate.""</p><p>
    It's interesting that Sharkey's first hip-hop album so closely mirrors Rjd2's recently released sophomore full-length.  Both records tackle a diverse array of genres and, to certain degrees, they both disappoint. That said, when Sharkey mirrors Rjd2, the reflection is straight from a funhouse; <i>Sharkey's Machine</i> is a terrifyingly unlikable elongation of Ronnie James' new formula.  The most talented artists practically phone-in their verses, the production itself is ultimately unprofessional and boring, the developing artists are completely amateur and the whole exercise comes off practically unlistenable.</p></div>"|6958.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6958-sharkeys-machine/|2.7|Rollie Pemberton

Long ago, pop music opened
    its doors to the world of technological convenience.  Now, accoutrements such as synthesizers, drum machines,
    and ProTools-style manipulators are standard fare for garage studios, and writing music is an increasingly
    solitary affair.  While these devices have in many ways enriched the artform, their advantages have often
    come at the expense of the synergistic effect of live musicianship.  Most regrettable is the loss of the
    exhilarating energy that can result when a group of people simultaneously know <em>exactly what the fuck
    they're doing</em>.</p><p>
    
    Natural Dreamers know what they're doing, and they relish it.  The band seeks to revive the floundering
    state of, well, the band-- that is, ""band"" as in the instinctual communion of musicians through an
    ineffable language and, most of all, lots of hard, noisy work.  <em>Natural Dreamers</em> sounds like the
    product of many strenuous nights; one can almost see guitarists Chris Cohen and John Dieterich eyeing each
    other cautiously as they toil to nail each well-spaced kick, or Jay Pellicci sweating to keep the ship
    afloat. Miraculously, as if by kismet, the disparate pieces fall in to place, and <em>Natural Dreamers</em>
    is the sundry result of equal parts fate and painstaking craftsmanship.</p><p>
    
    Natural Dreamers eschew immediate categorization, but it's helpful to consider that all three members have
    served time in Deerhoof.  Cohen and Dieterich are relentlessly jagged and instantly recognizable.  There's
    still no give to their boxy style of guitar playing.  In fact, Natural Dreamers consciously give groove a
    stiff arm, faring without a bassist or, often enough, time signatures.  At its worst, this formula yields
    instrumental math-rock that never learned its multiplication tables.  At best, the band distills the
    pellucid nectar of melody and offers a refreshing take on pop music, at once retrospective and prescient.</p><p>
    
    ""Singer"" tries on several different outfits before finding one that fits.  The band steps gingerly into these
    different guises, considering each new move with Kasparov-like deliberation.  When they finally decide where
    they're headed, their declaration of purpose is brazen and not a little shocking: The timid guitars abruptly
    meld into a fragmented three-note loop, while Pellicci loosely keeps time, battering his cymbals irreverently
    and filling leftover space with frenetic snare rolls.  From there, the track picks up the record's steadiest
    rhythmic vamp, a thick shuffle accompanied by a wistful glockenspiel melody.  It's a clear standout and a
    suitable mission statement for a band whose sound isn't easy to pin down.  Elsewhere, ""The Big Switch""
    approximates a free-jazz Lightning Bolt, while ""The Golden Pond"" and ""Fourth Man"" utilize silence and
    some analog electronics to an interesting stylistic effect.</p><p>
    
    If <i>Natural Dreamers</i> is at times unbearably chaotic, it isn't because the record is too strident;
    paradoxically, it's because some of the songs aren't abrasive enough.  There's tons of melody here, often
    crystalline and strikingly beautiful, only much of it is transmogrified by the band's flighty, abstract
    style of composition.  As such, tracks hint at a transcendent melody, only to not quite grasp it.</p><p>
    
    But in the end, this penchant for obfuscation is as much of a boon as it is a bane.  As they posited with
    Deerhoof, Cohen, Dieterich and Pellicci seem to believe that the visceral heart of pop music lies not in
    the way instrumental elements coagulate, but rather in each sound's naked isolation.  Much like abstract
    painters of the 20th century, who used paint as subject matter, they deconstruct and decontextualize
    traditional form, and as such, <i>Natural Dreamers</i> is a demanding but ultimately enlightening album.</p></div>"|5899.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5899-natural-dreamers/|7.6|Sam Ubl

Where that line is drawn is essentially the decision of each individual listener and consumer,     but in recent years, a sizeable number of people have no doubt determined that Björk has crossed it.  The     much-beloved chanteuse seems to release a new box set, compilation, DVD or multi-part single every other     month-- and although none of these new products carry malicious intent or are lazily conceived, the     eccentricity of some of her releases (particularly the perverse object-fetish box set <i>Family Tree</i>)     still seems to have cost her a tiny bit of goodwill.</p>
<p>Ironically, then, a quartet of previously released records-- some of which contain material that has also     already appeared on DVD-- is worth the attention of Björk's non-devotees.  Originally released last year     as a four-disc box (one that included a five-track DVD and a 32-page booklet), Björk's <i>Live</i> series     collects the best available recordings from each support tour for her four studio albums.  In some cases,     those ""best available"" recordings are either frequently bootlegged or have appeared on DVD, most notably     Björk's <i>Unplugged</i> session and her <i>Post</i>-era Shepherd's Bush Empire set.  The individual releases     allow Björk's more fervent fans who held out rather than re-purchase those recordings to collect the albums     they don't already own while presenting the less-devoted with the opportunity to pick and choose from among     the selections without committing to purchasing an entire box.  (Let's face it, most hardcore Björk fans     were going to buy the live box regardless of what it contained.)</p>
<p>The titles are perhaps misleading-- each disc isn't a replication of an album in a live setting; they're     simply named to correspond with each tour.  For Björk, it's an appropriate approach because each phase of     her solo career has had a distinct personality, look, and sound.  Most of <i>Debut Live</i> is constructed     from the aforementioned <i>Unplugged</i>-- the holdout is the much-circulated and elegant harpsichord     version of ""Venus as a Boy"", from a 1995 appearance on <i>Later with Jools Holland</i>. (The only absent     <i>Unplugged</i> track is ""Atlantic"".)  The set is mostly a muted affair in which the newly solo Björk     seems hesitant to be the focus.

You start out as a caterpillar, of course, a furry little thing with a tent-like exoskeleton and too many legs, but before long, you're wrapped in your chrysalis, slowly morphing into something entirely different, more mature, and frequently beautiful.  What I really think gives butterflies the edge over other species is that period of metamorphic hibernation-- during their most awkward phase, they're insulated from the world at large, and they still emerge with a new maturity.  On the other extreme, when we're in our most awkward phase, adolescence, we're thrust into the hostile social grist mills we refer to as schools, and emerging with a new-found maturity on the other end is no sure bet.  Some people emerge as adults, others just very large caterpillars.</p><p>
    
    People really have nothing to compare to that chrysalis state, though certainly try hard to find it; Thoreau on Walden Pond, transcendental meditation, or even a teenager in that awkward phase hiding out in her room with the radio up to drown out thoughts and inquisitive parents seem to reach for it.  To heighten the effect, that teenager might want to slip in <i>Cast from the Platform</i>, the sophomore effort from Lansing, MI's Auburn Lull, which is about as close as you can come, musically, to being wrapped in heavy gauze and closed in from the ugly detail revealed by harsh direct light.</p><p>
    
    There is no awkwardness in the world the band creates on <i>Cast from the Platform</i>, only abiding grace and enveloping beauty.  Even when they cast their tunnel of light drones and oceanic washes of guitar and synth texture across fractured rhythms, as they do on ""Season of False Starts"", the flow of sound is too natural to be hobbled.  ""Direction &amp; Destination"", meanwhile, has all the weightless illumination of the Verve's debut EP or Bark Psychosis' ""I Know"", Sean Heenan's rounded, seafoam (and suspiciously British-sounding) vocals drifting over Jason Weisinger's spacious drums through a cavern of water-formed reverb.</p><p>
    
    This is the kind of album that will no doubt garner more than a few reviews that try to pin a shoegazer label to it, and just as many that try to call it ""space-rock"" or something similar, and that's a shame, because it's entirely too ascendant to deserve the first term, and too terrestrial and warm to warrant the second.  ""Trenches"" may have guitars that could soundtrack a supernova, but that shuffling march beat keeps it firmly on the ground, while piano and dusty vocals render it human and evocative.  The music's principle paradox is its expansiveness in spite of the intimacy of the recording-- it's the kind of thing that seems perfect for a rainy day alone inside with cats and books, but also makes me want to get out the maps and start planning routes to scenic places.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, it's your choice when you listen to it; my role really only extends to imploring you to give it a go in the first place.  Auburn Lull's musical cocoon is a wholly inviting one, melodic and gorgeously textured, uniform in sound, but with enough rhythmic and tonal variety to explode any accusations of monochromaticism.  <i>Cast from the Platform</i> is an album you can immerse yourself in as deeply as you like, so step inside.  You won't regret it.</p></div>"|352.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/352-cast-from-the-platform/|8.0|Joe Tangari

    of collegiate music fan: the hippie and the hipster.  Meeting in empty parking lots late at night by secretive
    arrangements, the warring clans circle each other warily, threateningly snapping their fingers.  Suddenly,
    the hippies unleash a deafening volley of drum circle concussion, with accompaniment from that scruffy dude
    that plays one of those handless harmonicas.  Unfazed, the hipsters form a tight formation and frantically
    mimeograph an acerbic zine, filled with fanged mockery of trust-fund hemp activists.</p><p>
    
    Living in the war zone between these two vicious gangs is no easy job, akin to the complicated reconcilement
    acrobatics of a Log Cabin Republican.  But somehow Gomez have pulled it off over the course of their
    four-album career, blending a distinctly granola throwback sound with indie's willingness to sonically
    experiment.  The British group has yet to hit the jackpot on American shores but it seems the time for
    their mongrel sound may have finally come: The second day of this year's Lollapalooza features the likes
    of The Flaming Lips and The String Cheese Incident (and, appropriately, Gomez themselves).</p><p>
    
    'Tis a shame, then, that Gomez's trajectory toward the weird-- as traced from 1998's <i>Bring It On</i> to
    2002's <i>In Our Gun</i> by an increasing employment of electronic bells and whistles-- takes a severe
    backslide on <i>Split the Difference</i>.  Always one of the most American-sounding British bands, this
    latest album finds Gomez retreating to trad territory, filling out its 13 tracks with a healthy spoonful
    of sunshine daydream Ribfest ditties.  Save a few tantalizing moments of sonic trickery, <i>Split the
    Difference</i> would sound safe at home amidst your local cryogenic classic rock station, a fact tipped
    off by a centerpiece entitled ""Sweet Virginia"".</p><p>
    
    Surprisingly, that song isn't a Stones pastiche.  Instead, it's a sunburn-woozy track fleetingly enveloped
    by a haze of strings.  With ""Sweet Virginia"" and the unstable-balance-dial theatrics of ""We Don't Know Where
    We're Going"", Gomez hide their most dense, rewarding material in the core of the album, surrounding the
    tracks with accomplished but straightforward rock.  Most of the blame for that rote sound can be placed
    on the nicotine-meets-Vedder vocals of Ben Ottewell, who surrounds many of his growling performances in
    ""Where Ya Going?"" and ""Me, You and Everybody"" with tired distorted-bass riffing.  Bandmate Ian Ball is a
    less compelling vocalist, but most of his songs (""These 3 Sins"", ""Nothing Is Wrong"") succeed as anthemic
    and catchy yet simple arena rock.</p><p>
    
    So <i>Split the Difference</i> is an opportunity missed, with Gomez settling into a safe, well-worn ocean
    colour scene at a time when an adventurous indie/jamband hybrid might've clicked with Lollapaloozers.  In
    the kind of irony us hack reviewers love, <i>Split the Difference</i> does anything but, as the band merely
    courts and comforts the Phish mourners rather than mediating a college campus version of the Camp David
    Accords.</p></div>"|3512.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3512-split-the-difference/|5.7|Rob Mitchum

There are only a few artists for whom I'd waive this rule of
    thumb.  Luckily, they've never really tested me.  I was less keen on <i>Nocturama</i> than most of the
    rest of Nick Cave's catalog, and Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's latest threw me a little-- but there was enough
    virtue in each record to keep me enthralled by their respective franchises.  Bowie repeatedly disappoints
    me nowadays, but I have reconciled this by imagining two distinct Bowies, one on either side of the 80s.
    <i>Salt</i>, however, has me reassessing everything Arto Lindsay's ever released, the extent to which I
    ever really loved him, and whether I need to forgive him, too.</p><p>
    
    Lindsay's always been irreverent of the mainstream, unscrupulously dipping in and out of pop.  The public
    has held his work in fittingly whimsical regard, as a given release might briefly capture the zeitgeist,
    only for the next to follow less relevant tangents.  Lindsay flirts with avant-rock and pop, never fully
    subscribing to a genre, though an enduring affair with bossa nova colors most of his work.  Reminiscent
    of a youthful Leonard Cohen about to lose himself entirely in listless day-dreaming, Lindsay has always
    let his soft, elusive vocals glisten like a layer of honey over their contained melodies.</p><p>
<i>Salt</i>, much in step with Lindsay's more recent mode, recalls neither his ""fake jazz"" combo The Lounge
    Lizards, nor his dance/noise project Ambitious Lovers-- and it's a long, <i>long</i> way from the no-wave
    DNA project that he began with back in 1978.  Instead, it carries forth the Brazilian electronic theme
    instilled during Lindsay's mid-90s experiments with such artists as Vinicius Cantauria.  ""Twins"" typifies
    this approach, pairing loose world and trip-hop flavored beats with glitchy electronics and recalling that
    era's <i>The Subtle Body</i> LP.</p><p>
    
    What disappoints here, compared to, say, 2002's <i>Invoke</i>, is a conspicuous distance between Lindsay's
    sexually charged and insightful lyrics and their rightful musical home.  You get the feeling that the vocal
    tracks could be indiscriminately swapped between songs and you'd never notice.  On ""Kamo (Dark Stripe)"",
    Arto's Mick Hucknall-esque croon drifts meaninglessly on the technically proficient yet bland and subdued
    backing.  Too many songs go by unnoticed, polished to such a blinding sheen that their surfaces reflect
    little discernable color or character.</p><p>
    
    The album isn't without its pleasant moments, though.  ""Into Shade"" is subtle and delicate, melting into
    gorgeous strings and perfectly restrained guitar phrasing.  Here, Lindsay's voice interacts fully with the
    instrumentation rather than floating somewhere nearby in ponderous detachment.  ""Personagem"" is a rich
    bossa nova excursion dotted with clever melodic interludes and an infectious, recurring guitar riff.  The
    album rotates around ""Jardim da Alma"" (or ""Garden of the Soul""), a cluttered but accomplished amalgamation
    of Lindsay's transcontinental influences.</p><p>
<i>Salt</i> does some disservice to Lindsay's progression without entirely disgracing it.  There's ample
    prettiness here to ensure second and third listens, but this will be no one's favorite Arto Lindsay album.
    As the music flickers with poise and confidence, the vocals fail to emote the seductive implications of
    Lindsay's words.  Maybe it's this lack of cohesion that ""De Lama Lamina"" descends into squawky discordance
    to protest.  Although <i>Salt</i> is mixed, frustrating, and hardly reflects the twenty-odd years Lindsay
    spent getting here, it's a peccadillo amidst an otherwise admirable legacy.  Guess I'll be back for more
    after all.</p></div>"|4805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4805-salt/|6.5|Dan Lett

    stew. Sure, that sound has always been around, kept alive in both the thriving cult of Nick Drake and by
    the dudes who get into Tim Buckley because the hottest girl they ever knew loved his kid's voice.  But if
    the folk trend started in earnest late last year with the homey, kitchen-sink ramble of the Fiery Furnaces'
    <i>Gallowsbird's Bark</i>, then it broke wide open in 2004 with the enthusiastic reaction to Devendra Banhart's
    <i>Rejoicing in the Hand</i>.</p><p>
    
    Tanakh's Jesse Poe has been flirting with folk for some time; his 2001 debut, <i>Villa Claustrophobia</i>,
    is a rootsy, often incredibly multi-ethnic sonic bouillabaisse.  But with <i>Dieu Deuil</i>, Poe's harnessing
    of organic folk and psych textures feels even more effortless-- and just a little bit genius.</p><p>
    
    Working with a new slew of collaborators-- including violinist Dan Calhoune and bassist/backing vocalist
    Michele Poulos-- Poe has fashioned a warmhearted meditation steeped in historically American rhythms.
    However, the record also has streaks of <i>Villa</i>'s afield folk enclaves.  ""The Lord Is in This Place...
    How Dreadful Is This Place"" is a Middle East drone tinged with traditional percussion, snatches of vocal
    chatter, and a wavering violin lead.  ""Images"" is an introspective, possibly improvisational piece that
    percolates with faraway found sounds, brassy cymbal, and an accordion that flits down a dark passageway
    like a rambunctious child thief.</p><p>
    
    While these stylistic wanderings are charming-- and stippled with a pleasant warmth-- <i>Dieu Deuil</i>'s
    primary thrust is a slowly setting, vaguely psychedelic Americana sun of robust acoustic guitar and keening
    violin.  Poe's smoky baritone drifts through the whispering branches of ""November Tree"", which suggests
    everything from Pink Floyd to acoustic dream-pop.  ""And sometimes you find a little peace of mind/ In your
    tinfoil stars and your bottle of wine,"" Poe intones, ""And sometimes I still need her.""  Poulos' echoing
    harmonies ease the song's darker suggestions (""Now I know/ All of us will have to go""), as does its hangover
    percussive brushing and hopeful bridge.</p><p>
    
    Tanakh seems to be admitting a bittersweet mood, but hoping to get out of it with some love, drugs and
    affection.  That intent seeps through the six sighing minutes of ""Instrumental"", which finds a quiet inlet
    of babbling electronics, thoughtful electric guitar soloing, and tear-streaked violin.  The track is exactly
    the type of modernist folk interpretation that's been buzzing in informed circles since the emergence of
    Sufjan Stevens.  Although Poe's vocals occasionally seem like an afterthought, he scores big with ""Lady
    Eucharist"". On that track, his plucked acoustic guitar follows the loping path of a trap kit, and his
    shifting intonations make his brittle cerebral folk that much more engaging.</p><p>
    
    Tanakh's <i>Dieu Deuil</i>, the boppy mysticism of Vetiver, and the healing qualities of that band's
    Banhart all point to something in the comet's tail.  Maybe it's a purposeful move away from the ghettoizing
    qualities of alt-country.  (""We like having acoustic instrumentation over for beers,"" people seem to be
    saying.  ""Just don't invite Ryan Adams."")  But the recent embrace of intelligent, sadness-tinged introspection
    could also have something to do with the sudden passing of Elliott Smith, in whom those qualities simmered
    like battered, fermented fruit.  Whatever the larger forces at work, Jesse Poe has sketched another quiet
    heaven with <i>Dieu Deuil</i>, a record that sounds like a parchment ink of folk's roots but also basks in
    sun-dappled 21st Century modernism.</p></div>"|7927.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7927-dieu-deuil/|8.1|Johnny Loftus

    2003 ""No War"" tour of Europe, a trip that coincided with the early days of the U.S. invasion of Iraq.  The
    first piece is called ""Protest"" and the album is dedicated ""To all the people who have lost their lives at
    the hands of U.S. imperialism.""  So it's a political record, obviously, and an anti-war statement-- and it
    may also be the Trio's apology to the world for what they and many others feel is a corrupt and malicious
    U.S. administration.</p><p>
<i>Slon</i> is also entirely instrumental, which happens to be my favorite kind of political music.  As a
    result, ""Protest"" works on several levels.  Chad Taylor's forceful drumming is the driving surge and Noel
    Kupersmith hammers out a bassline that sounds like a variation on the theme to <i>Mission: Impossible</i>
    while Rob Mazurek charges forward on cornet, ironically referencing the martial roots of his instrument
    while mixing anger into his tone.  It's a powerful piece of music given an extra intriguing wrinkle by the
    subtle processed sounds that cycle through its final third.</p><p>
    
    The continued incorporation of electronics into the Chicago Underground Trio's music (both Mazurek and
    Kupersmith are credited with ""computer"") is one the best things they have going for themselves.  The
    squishy German glitches that underpin ""Slon"" sound great with a horn floating above them, not unlike Jan
    Jelinek's collaboration with Computer Soup.  ""Palermo"" continues in <i>Tron</i> land, folding field
    recordings into a hypnotic rhythm loop and setting them against a swooning keyboard line.  And ""Kite""
    begins as a completely abstract piece-- with creepy drones that sound pulled from the circuit board of
    an early Raymond Scott experiment-- before the band adds various improvised horn squeaks, rimshot taps
    and e-bow groans.  So while ""Kite"" has a whiff of classic 1950s avant-garde, the Trio add sweetener,
    upping the accessibility.</p><p>
    
    Yet, when the Trio are so inclined, they can sound downright traditional, as on ""Sevens"", where Mazurek
    invokes Freddie Hubbard and Taylor manhandles his cymbals like mid-60s Tony Williams.  The trad instruments
    also dominate on the funky ""Shoe Lace""-- which has hints of hard bop-- and the wistful midtempo closer
    ""Pear"", which finds Mazurek with a mute and Taylor dutifully tapping out the ""ch-ch-ch"" on the ride.</p><p>
    
    While like-minded bands such as Tortoise and Isotope 217 can seem stymied by the endless possibilities of
    the studio, the Chicago Underground Trio seem to always eventually return to jazz structure and rhythm.
    So although the Trio operate within a smaller sphere than many of their contemporaries, they remain open
    to possibility and produce inspired combinations of seemingly different sounds-- and the economical and
    engaging <i>Slon</i> is evidence that they're on to something.</p></div>"|1767.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1767-slon/|7.5|Mark Richardson

    unusual, but when the New York-based funk/rock octet !!! kept a prominent finger in the disco-punk pie
    with merely one song, last year's ""Me and Giuliani Down by the School Yard (A True Story)"", it seemed an
    impressive feat.  Two years earlier, the band had cut a self-titled full-length that went mostly unnoticed.
    But by 2001, !!! had latched onto an updated no-wave aesthetic that countless other bands would soon
    mindlessly mishandle.  The featured 10-minute dancepunk epic-- stuffed with more hooks and movements than
    entire full-length albums-- not only reclaimed the band's reputation, but promised new life to the genre
    itself.  The band's trajectory was the genre's trajectory, and with ""Me and Giuliani"", !!! and disco-punk
    began to stray away from safe post-punk skronk, and gradually draw nearer to more adventurous disco sleek.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Louden Up Now</i>, !!! have progressed toward a slicker, more disco-oriented sound.  The band generally
    forgo the sloppy horn lines and heavy punk riff backbone of their debut, opting instead for slow, trance-like
    builds.  At the heart of the album is a suffocating, dark electro-acoustic disco smog that recalls Black
    Devil's 1979 <i>Disco Club</i> EP, as well as Larry Levan, Walter Gibbons, and Arthur Russell's more
    pessimistic contributions to the disco underground.  All of which is to say that the production on <i>Louden
    Up Now</i> is particularly commendable.  Over the course of songs such as the first single ""Pardon My Freedom"",
    ""Shit Scheisse Merde (Part 1)"", and album highlight ""Hello? Is This Thing On?"", the !!! rhythm section boasts
    not only an adroit shape-shifting timbre, but enough subtlety for close listening.</p><p>
<i>Louden Up Now</i> isn't all dancefloor thrills, however: !!! smartly dodge pigeonholes and one-trick-pony
    accusations with some less punchy moves, such as the psychedelic grind of ""Dear Can"" and the bright but blunted
    moonbounce of ""Theme from Space Island"".  On ""Shit Scheisse Merde (Part 2)"", the band even curiously infringe
    on the drum sampling and sparse rhythmic figures of their sister group Out Hud.</p><p>
    
    So the production is great, the songbook is varied, and the band is tighter and more ambitious than ever--
    the only problem with <i>Louden Up Now</i> is the unfortunate paucity of ideas within the songs themselves.
    It's as if the equivalent of all of the musical energy of ""Me and Giuliani"" has been spread over the album's
    nine other tracks.  While <i>Louden Up Now</i>'s electronic embellishments are finely mutated, the album
    sorely misses the huge, nearly anthemic guitar hooks that, to my mind, make !!! so exciting.  Also sadly
    absent from anything other than ""Me and Giuliani"" are the distinct chapter-like movements of !!!'s longer
    numbers.  On both ""Shit Scheisse Merde (Part 2)"" and ""Dear Can"", !!! get caught in a groove and seem
    hesitant to explore other potential variations or moods.</p><p>
    
    !!! always flirted with the possibility that they'd fail to fully deliver on the promise of ""Me and Giuliani""--
    unfortunately, just as a single 12-inch can make a reputation, that track can also serve as a potentially
    unforgiving benchmark.  <i>Louden Up Now</i> contains plenty of good ideas-- as well as two tracks
    (""Pardon My Freedom"" and ""Hello? Is This Thing On?"") that could soundtrack summer dance parties and net
    !!! a larger audience.  But even when one considers that most listeners are no longer apt to be wowed simply
    by the concept of dance music with guitars-- and that most of !!!'s audience has come to accept Nic Offer's
    generally asinine lyrics as an inherent part of the group's unique dynamic-- <i>Louden Up Now</i> is simply
    not the indie-dance juggernaut many hoped it would be.</p></div>"|1764.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1764-louden-up-now/|7.0|Nick Sylvester

    Hydravion, any esteem he now enjoys is overwhelmingly due to his prominent inclusion on Nurse with Wound's
    notorious ""influences list,"" which famously graced the liner notes of their 1979 debut.  Unsurprisingly,
    NWW's Stephen Stapleton (master of the griseous, warlock-from-the-North image) simply had to reward
    Besombes for a biography any promising young eccentric would covet.</p><p>
    A toiling candidate for a doctorate in chemistry at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique,
    Besombes got through his student years with a steady intake of French pop, free jazz, free love, and
    free hallucinogenic substances.  Eventually growing bored with traditional instrumentation, Besombes
    turned to the lavish lifestyle and opulent environs of a true early electronic pioneer: breaking into
    neighboring physics labs and ""borrowing"" their equipment.  During any interims, he intrepidly traveled to
    the mideast, brushed up on his tabla and sitar skills, studied briefly under Stockhausen and Xenakis, and
    finally released the <i>Libra</i> soundtrack, his finest work, at the ripe age of 24.</p><p>
    Besombes' music may have anticipated everything from The Bomb Squad's mélange of shattered shrills to
    Luke Vibert's anarchic slapstick-hop, but no one should be more grateful that Besombes turned from chemistry
    to electronics than his old lab partner.  If <i>Libra</i> is any indication, Besombes was the Jerry Lewis-in-cardiac-arrest
    of the lab, leaving lighted Bunsen burners in his pocket and sporadically diving into shelves of glassware.
    The deceivingly titled ""Jaune"" is a rabid merry-go-round horse in Toontown, unleashing volatile potions
    of carbonated poisons and barbarized tape-loops before sizzling down in the sound of exploding construction
    sites and psychedelic exhilaration.  On ""PJF 261"", cut-up dialogues are doled out over gurgling, choking
    sound effects and cathedral diva sirens, like some epochal brawl between the blasphemous and beatific.</p><p>
    Although this iconoclastic, convoluted genre is the most efficient at merging the popular and avant-garde
    music of Besombes's training, <i>Libra</i> (perhaps because it's a soundtrack) ventures through almost
    every experimental genre of the early 1970s, from spliced tape works and minimalism to loose folk-rock
    and dub.  This bizarre, endlessly fascinating juxtaposition is all the more mysterious since the film
    itself has seemingly fallen off the edge of the earth.  Nevertheless, if the poster is to be believed,
    the movie apparently concerned the madcap meandering of a translucent cowboy who happens to be as big
    as the moon.</p><p>
    Whether or not the poster's synopsis is accurate, this is undeniably the music a moon-sized cowboy would
    listen to: ""Raggacountry"", for example, is Delta sitar being windswept over echoing percussion.  ""Boogimmick""
    is a self-parodic blues-rock solo haunted by probing satellites and pulsating, parched craters.  ""Rugby""
    takes a similar guitar riff and throbs it over free jazz drumrolls and orgiastic, weeping babies.  Imagine
    cramming a hack Ronnie Van Zant clone and a pedophilic clown into a mother's womb, and you're halfway
    there.</p><p>
    The more ambient pieces are just as worthwhile, despite that their random dispersal throughout the album
    makes for a dizzyingly uneven listen.  The droning bells and plangent crashes of ""Theme Grave"" start off
    as an erudite, flickering tonal exploration and end in a dignified funeral procession.  On the comparatively
    lengthy ""Avécandista"", a screeching child's voice is taunted on every side by seemingly arbitrary organ
    conflagrations and Morse code squalor.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, the four songs not written by Besombes are vastly inferior to the other material on the
    album, bristling with dull Bacharach-folk and lethargic brass choruses, somehow both lazy and fatiguing
    simultaneously.  Not even the sparsely sprinkled prog-distortion is enough to lift them out of their
    doldrums.  To make up for these embarrassments, Israel's MIO Records has filled out the album to 76
    minutes with four bonus tracks, one of which is a brooding, 20-minute prepared piano piece.  The purpose
    of any prepared piano is to display the physicality (and percussion) of the instrument, to extract the
    piano from that ambiguous, incorporeal domain of sound we traditionally associate with music and kick it
    around a bit.  Besombes' version succeeds remarkably, letting razors shred the strings and frame, toppling
    marbles down the soundboard, and variously knocking, battering and scraping the piano's sides and interior.
    At one point, even the rusty hinge of a piano bench is lent to the instrument's tottering rhythm.</p><p>
    The remaining bonus tracks are instructive, if only because they point towards the synthesis of the popular
    and experimental that Besombes' music personifies.  Despite Besombes' current obscurity, if you need only
    one song to represent the stunning collision of genres that resulted in what you and I call modern music,
    you could do far worse than ""La Ville"", <i>Libra</i>'s masterpiece and a tune that even today smacks of
    audacity and ingenuity with its manic jazz drumming, spy-soundtrack bass, Latin percussion and backwards
    tapes of conniving seagulls and destruction derbies.  ""La Ville"" feels like one of those moments that
    irreversibly set the pop music of the last quarter-century on a course for trip-hop and noise-rock,
    veneration and confrontation, culture-clashes and mind-melts.  And, as if that wasn't enough, it's in
    fucking French.</p></div>"|1112.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1112-libra/|8.4|Alex Linhardt

    of the Danielson Famile; the New Jersey graduate student who transformed his thesis into a theology-heavy
    debut record; the dude in the tree suit surrounded by wide-eyed kids dressed like doctors and nurses--
    could ever be matched by his music.  Except that Daniel Smith, recording here as Br. Danielson, is the
    proud owner of one of the most confounding and unapologetic human yelps ever committed to tape.  Each
    note is a shambling, raucous mix of high-pitched squeak and frantic chant.  And the best part is that
    Smith isn't quixotically crumpling to the ground, holding his nose and speaking-in-tongues, or perpetuating
    a new brand of cheeky faux-gospel-- he's actually singing, and it is actually insane.</p><p>
    
    Labelmate (and here, guest banjoist) Sufjan Stevens regularly performs live while wearing homemade angel
    wings, as his backing band forms a perfect line, horizontally spread on either side of him, sporting
    matching outfits (jeans, sneakers, loose white t-shirts, wings), all freshly scrubbed and calm.  Br.
    Danielson embodies what it might sound like were Stevens' entire troupe to simultaneously go completely
    fucking bonkers-- reeling, horrifying, and surprisingly outlandish, yet still retaining an impressively
    pristine, Langley Schools-ish impishness: Danielson may seem crazy, but he is not without a certain
    childlike grace.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps unsurprisingly, there's also something vaguely menacing about Br. Danielson, although it has less
    to do with frenzied morality and everything to do with general sonic precariousness.  Swallow your fears of
    indoctrination and face this record as is: The religious undertones of <i>Brother Is to Son</i>, Smith's
    first record without the Danielson Famile, are mostly incidental.  The hyper-aware will pluck out repeated
    references to righteousness, the devil, God, crosses, and purity-- though there are certainly no more of
    those here than on most country or metal records.  In fact, any anxiety produced by <i>Brother Is to Son</i>'s
    broadcast can be tied to Danielson as performer, not Danielson as prophet.  Ultimately, it's Br. Danielson's
    sharp barks and frantic strumming that will test your patience, and not necessarily his moral/religious
    agenda: Shockingly, Smith's music actually manages to wholly supercede his reputation, burying avant-Christian
    doctrines in a flurry of banjo and drums.</p><p>
    
    Overall, <i>Brother Is to Son</i> is pulled a little too tight, and subsequently feels perpetually on the
    edge of collapse, as if Danielson's good intentions are just seconds away from bursting into a million
    flaming bits.  The awkward push of his cartoonish squawks counters the gentle pull of his parables, a
    tension perfectly reflected in his choice of instrumentation: acoustic guitar backed by big, thunderous
    rock drumming.  The resulting sound is both compelling and off-putting, and <i>Brother Is to Son</i>
    occasionally suffers from the repetition of its primary trick.  Still, there's something hopelessly
    intriguing about Smith's particular brand of neo-folk, and his bizarre frenzy can be addictive-- <i>Brother
    Is to Son</i> has moments of perverse brilliance (opener ""Things Against Stuff"", which wonders, ""Which side
    are you on?  Who loves stuff?  Who votes for things?"") followed by bits of oddly palatable folk-psych
    (""Cookin' Mid-County"", which admits, ""This music/ It is killing us!"").</p><p>
    
    With America more politically polarized than ever, and extremists on all sides becoming toothier by the
    second, it would be awfully easy to dismiss Br. Danielson as a novelty act, or as some kind of screeching
    religious missionary, sent to wash clean indie rock's many sins.  <i>Brother Is to Son</i> is weird, but
    it's neither incomprehensible nor didactic.  Consider yourself saved.</p></div>"|1113.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1113-brother-is-to-son/|7.1|Amanda Petrusich

    seemingly straightforward Pitchfork diatribes.  As doggedly opinionated and viciously direct as we'd like
    to appear, a pen-wielding soldier is never fully in control of the personal bias and at-large influence
    that can taint his otherwise pure, Zen-like focus.  The trick, say the masters, is to acknowledge your
    humanity (really!) and use it to your advantage.  Trust your first impression.  Don't believe the hype.
    And never forget that the music is why we're all here.</p><p>
    
    So, perhaps as a direct challenge to my consistent-- but never unchecked-- enthusiasm, Schreiber's assigned
    me to the latest from Moby, who's recording under the guise of Voodoo Child, which the Vegan One most
    prominently assumed back in '96 for his ambient <i>The End of Everything</i>.  Now fresh from a smash
    world tour in support of 2002's <i>18</i>, and still criticized in some circles for his lucrative stroll
    down Madison Avenue to coincide with 1999's soulful <i>Play</i>, here Moby seeks to reconnect to the dance
    floor and, as he says, the ""underground.""  <i>Baby Monkey</i>'s liner notes also relate Moby's rekindled
    love for ""hard, sexy, straightforward dance music,"" borne of a quintessential late-night episode at a
    Glasgow warehouse party.</p><p>
    
    To the writer seeking a levelheaded approach, the conflicts are many:</p><p>
    
    1) Given his widely publicized, somewhat nutty beliefs, Moby is an incredibly easy target. Some of his past
    efforts have been pretty solid.  Some of his past efforts have been total fluff.</p><p>
    
    2) A pseudonym means very little when an artist is credited with writing and producing the songs.</p><p>
    
    3) It's hard to be ""underground"" when you're an international superstar.</p><p>
    
    4) No review, positive or negative, will alter the selling power of this album.</p><p>
    
    5) And so on.</p><p>
    
    Sun-tzu says, ""Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:
    This is the art of retaining composure.""  Certainly nobody's enemy, <i>Baby Monkey</i> is still, in a
    word, hubbub.  In the face of disorder and the opportunity to ground the enemy into bits, the writer must
    retain composure.  As such:</p><p>
<i>Baby Monkey</i> is a clinic in what's bad about bad dance music.  There's no life breathing through
    these 12 flaccid tracks, each of which would've seemed regressive even in Moby's early-90s heyday-- today,
    each is a total anachronism.  The production is shockingly gauzy and weak, and the result is an easily
    dismissed, second-rate throwaway that only the most devout Moby zealot could appreciate.</p><p>
    
    The bluesy funk of <i>Play</i> is largely absent, surfacing intermittently in the vocal samples of ""Gotta
    Be Loose in Your Mind"" and ""Unh Yeah""'s gospel organ and piano tinkling.  And Moby's earliest work showed
    more complex rhythmic structures and clever sampling; the driving intensity of 10-year-old tracks like
    ""Besame"" and ""Go"" are replaced by a petulant skiffle and metallic sterility that would sound best pumping
    from a dentist office P.A.  The album's marginally shifting rhythms fluctuate a few BPM here and there,
    dipping into light techno (""Minors""), light house (""Last"") and a light breakbeat (""Gone""), but there's never
    enough guts for the dance floor, nor enough smarts for the headphones.  Where Moby should be shining behind
    the keys, ""Light Is in Your Eyes"" sticks out only for its soft, worn-out ""We Are All Made of Stars"" synth
    melody, and the obviously titled ""Synthesisers"" [sic] barely keeps its head above the same waters he tread
    with 1993's also obviously titled <i>Ambient</i>.</p><p>
    
    With so much great dance music being made today, it's a shame this will get more press than most by virtue
    of Moby's name alone-- which is supposed to be concealed by the Voodoo Child alter ego in the first place.
    But dance music accepts no revivalism-- especially when your update isn't as good as your original.  So
    although it means stuff like <i>Baby Monkey</i> is hardly necessary, it is at least to Moby's credit that
    he's much better at moving into the future than at looking to the past.</p></div>"|8496.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8496-baby-monkey/|4.2|Jonathan Zwickel

    return to glory, <i>Murray Street</i>, in particular, and will likely arise in response to any remotely
    decent effort from the group herein.  It might have dawned on some fans only after hearing <i>Murray
    Street</i> that Sonic Youth's mean age was then roughly 45, and that the group arguably hadn't produced
    a record of such caliber since they were in their late 20s.  And while age is certainly unavoidable, as
    sensitive fifty-something poets constantly remind us, it shouldn't come as any great surprise that the
    band still pack some alternately-tuned potency in their aging physiognomies: There are manifold examples
    of musicians in most every genre, besides younglings rock and hip-hop, who have continued playing, if not
    composing, masterfully, well into their 70s.</p><p>
    
    Like the best jazz musicians, Sonic Youth have turned their love for experimental rock into a habit;
    perhaps more so than any other band, they've transcended the temporality of quality output in rock music.
    While bands like the Rolling Stones and the Grateful Dead continue to take the stage in a larkish clamber,
    Sonic Youth are still alive in the studio, where the process of making music is somewhat more draining than
    regurgitating old hits every once in a well-publicized while.  With centenarianism becoming more of an
    improbable reality and less of a tall tale, it's no longer inconceivable that rock composers might thrive
    into their latter days, especially now that the relatively young genre has been given time to produce a
    few elder masters.  In short, Sonic Youth aren't an exception; they're a pioneer example of a nascent rule.</p><p>
    
    That said, while <i>Sonic Nurse</i> isn't quite as strong as its predecessor, it's equally as imbued with
    instrumental dexterity and impressively coherent ideas.  Unlike <i>Murray Street</i>, the album isn't so
    much an expansion of form as a return to it: Here, Sonic Youth harken back to the noisome atmospherics of
    their late-80s work, only handing it a more crystalline production treatment that smacks of more recent
    releases like <i>A Thousand Leaves</i>.  Whether the implications of the line are intentional or not is
    difficult to say, but when, on ""Paper Cup Exit"", Lee Ranaldo sings, ""It's later than it seems,"" the band
    seem to be keenly aware of their age and relevance.  That self-awareness, both of an appreciably long canon
    and the four lives it has traversed, makes <i>Sonic Nurse</i> all the more remarkable.</p><p>
    
    Throughout their career, Sonic Youth have indulged in as much avant-garde experimentation as they have
    ground out formal studio albums.  If anything, the lesson taught by mishaps such as the infamous <i>NYC
    Ghosts &amp; Flowers</i> is that Sonic Youth are best at being themselves.  Fortunately, that ""self"" is an
    enormously vibrant and sophisticated entity, capable of evoking a broad range of moods and tones, and
    continually learning from its mistakes.  As atrocious as <i>NYC Ghosts &amp; Flowers</i> was, they never
    repeated its missteps, and for that it can be conveniently forgotten.  Conversely, when the group hits
    their stride, they know to run with it, as they do here, swimmingly riding the ample momentum generated
    by <i>Murray Street</i>.</p><p>
    
    ""Pattern Recognition"" opens, touching down on a well-trodden playing field of heady, arpeggiated riffage.
    After a brief, almost proggy intro, the song descends into a perilous odd-time build redolent of ""Candle"",
    as Kim Gordon brays ""you're the one"" in wontedly <i>Daydream</i> fashion, forgoing the bloodless beat
    poetry whining that often made her presence an annoyance in recent years.  16 years later, her pipes are
    still as seductively smoke-tinged as they were on ""Kissability"", and the opener marks the first of several
    pleasant appearances by Gordon on <i>Nurse</i>.  ""Unmade Bed"", the record's only sub-four-minute endeavor,
    recalls the nocturnal second half of <i>Murray Street</i>, casting beacons of beautifully melodic guitar
    as it builds to a gloriously intertwined climax.  As with many of the band's best songs, it takes a few
    listens for the riffs to sink in, but once they have, they're indelible.</p><p>
    
    Dynamically, however, not every track on <i>Sonic Nurse</i> is as striking as the band have proved themselves
    capable.  <i>Murray Street</i>'s ""Rain on Tin"" was a euphoric rollercoaster ride that seemed to capsulize
    to the band's entire career.  ""Stones"", perhaps this album's closest parallel to that song, erupts with an
    insurgent guitar melody after a rocky climb, and features more than its fair share of strong riffs.  Yet,
    while doubtless a strong number, the track isn't nearly as dramatic as career highlights like ""Washing
    Machine"" and ""Expressway to Yr Skull"".  Additionally, ""Mariah Carey and the Arthur Doyle Handcream"" is a
    more traditional Kim Gordon screed that extends about two minutes too long in its monotonous din to be as
    effective as <i>Murray Street</i>'s similar ""Plastic Sun"".</p><p>
    
    However, while those tracks do belabor the flow of the record slightly, their impotency is more accurately
    attributable to <i>Sonic Nurse</i>'s questionable sequencing.  While many of these songs exemplify the band
    in top form, they're sometimes inhibited by the record's somewhat scatterbrained narrative arch.  ""Peace
    Attack"", in particular, suffers from mishandling.  Played in isolation, the track is clever and wistful,
    but in its role as closing song, it feels awkwardly contrived and anticlimactic.  Meanwhile, ""Pattern
    Recognition"", another one of the band's finest recent tracks, seems too bold an opening statement for this
    deeply cogitative collection.  And unlike <i>Murray Street</i>, which was anchored by the towering middle
    track, ""Karen Revisited"", this issue lacks a similar axis to corral the disparate tones and give them
    direction.</p><p>
    
    Of course, considering these minor bones of contention, <i>Sonic Nurse</i> is hardly what one might call a
    disappointment.  ""The Dripping Dream"" adheres to the familiar tension/release/jam formula typified by ""Rain
    on Tin"", but manages to keep fresh with a reliably brilliant guitar apex before receding into a hazy wash
    that recalls the deliquescent waning minutes of ""The Sprawl"".   ""I Love Golden Blue"" features a formless,
    protracted intro that points to the band's one-time relationship with seminal avant-garde composer/no-wave
    icon Glenn Branca.  And ""Peace Attack"", despite its placement, is quietly poignant in contrast with
    erstwhile monoliths such as ""Trilogy"" and ""The Diamond Sea"".</p><p>
    
    Even the staunchest pundits should find something to like on <i>Sonic Nurse</i>, while steadfast devotees
    are well accounted for by the record's sheer canonical breadth.  Though its ultimate placement in the
    band's legacy is a debate waiting to happen, <i>Sonic Nurse</i> is certainly on a plane with some of Sonic
    Youth's better work.  Indeed, it is later than it seems.  And for a band to live up to that proclamation on
    its 19th album is awesome.</p></div>"|7348.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7348-sonic-nurse/|8.5|Sam Ubl

Despite     opposing my sworn allegiances to Led Zeppelin and Funkadelic, the Osaka collective is one of the few to     flirt with me at all points in its existence.  After their turn-of-the-century string of cosmic trance     punk efforts, I had even less trouble convincing people these guys (and a gal) were great.  However,     their earliest releases still have yet to attract hordes; some fans think they're the real bore-attraction,     but they're often derailed as chaotic goof-fests.  As I see it, you need this Boredoms to really appreciate     today's ""Vooredoms,"" to hear all the shit that went down before they found the sun.  Better still, most of     it fucking rocks.  Isn't that a nice bonus?</p>
<p>Boredoms actually began as a Yamatsuka Eye bedroom-recording project, represented on the long gone <i>Anal     by Anal</i> EP, which was later appended to the band's first full-length release outside of Japan, <i>Onanie     Bomb Meets the Sex Pistols</i> (a variation on their Japanese debut, <i>Osorezan No Stooges Kyo</i>, or     <i>The Stooges' Craze in Osorezan</i>).  Eye had earned an infamous reputation in the mid-80s as part of     an extreme noise/no-wave band called The Hanatarash, an outfit that fused performance art, post-hardcore     antipathy and self-destruction into one violent, messy bolt of shock and awe.  Hanatarash recordings could     veer anywhere from pure noise to primitive synth squealing to frantic DJ cutups using Rush samples, and     were not only a direct forecast of Boredoms, but of 90s ""Japanoise"" in general.</p>
<p>After recording the ""anal trilogy"" on his own (consisting of ""Anal Eater"", ""God from Anal"" and ""Born to     Anal"", appended to the end of <i>Onanie Bomb</i>), Eye formed his ""rock"" band Boredoms, with Hanatarash     member Taketani on drums, guitarist Mara Tabata (later of Zeni Geva), and bassist Hosoi.  Toyohito Yoshikawa     soon replaced Taketani, and when Tabata quit, Eye asked his friend Seiichi Yamamoto to join.  The two had     briefly played in another band together, along with future Boredoms bassist Hira, though Yamamoto didn't     initially think Eye would be a very compatible musical partner.  Perhaps he was concerned about Eye's     history of destroying pets and demolishing clubs during his Hanatarash days.  Fittingly, this     incarnation of the band recorded its first LP in a self-described ""messy studio,"" preparing the grotesque,     sprawling punk emissions of their early days.</p>
<p>1988's <i>Onanie Bomb Meets the Sex Pistols</i> (""onanie"" being Japanese slang for ""female masturbation"")     was the overseas version of Boredoms' first album, featuring all of <i>Osorezan No Stooges Kyo</i> and     <i>Anal by Anal</i>.  Released on WEA in Japan and Reprise in the U.S., <i>Onanie Bomb</i> began the trend     of Boredoms albums qualifying as the one of the strangest ever released on a major label.  Much like Germany's     Faust in the early 70s, Boredoms were thrust into an alternative rock spotlight despite playing ""music"" that,     even by the band's appraisal (other members complained that Eye's final mix of their first record bore little     resemblance to what they'd originally recorded), was hard to take.</p>
<p>American experimentalists Sonic Youth and John Zorn were quick to champion the band, and former     Bongwater/Butthole Surfers bassist Kramer would release 1989's <i>Soul Discharge</i> on his Shimmy     Disc imprint.  But well-known fans by no means make <i>Onanie Bomb</i> more palatable: Exhibits include     Eye's anal trilogy, with percussion supplied by a drumming instruction cassette, under which Eye screams,     shrieks and squirts to his heart's content.  ""Born to Anal"" features angular guitar work from former member     Tabata, and comes out like a badly recorded DNA demo fronted by someone who's being tattooed on the forehead.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, on ""Boredoms, Vs, SDI"", the group drops their patented sludgy, post-Stooges take on acid-rock     while Eye growls and screams to beat the band.  Musically, Boredoms weren't then far from early Melvins,     though their flare for grossing listeners out was without peer-- hang on for the last, semi-digestible     minute of ""Young Assouls"" at your peril.  At that point, they might have been best summed up by their own     titles, ""No Core Punk"" and ""Feedbackfuck"", though ""Lick'n Cock Boatpeople"" arguably gives the best idea of     what <i>Onanie Bomb</i> is about.</p>
<p>Later in 1988, Yoshimi P-We replaced Yoshikawa (who stayed on as co-vocalist) on drums, and would first     appear on 1989's <i>Soul Discharge</i>-- and it's too bad that record wasn't included in this wave of     reissues, because it's otherwise easiest available only as a single track containing its ten songs on     Shimmy Disc's <i>Soul Discharge/Early Boredoms</i> release.  It's certainly a better introduction to the     first stage of Boredoms than <i>Onanie Bomb</i>, with better recording quality and a more palatable ratio     of sort-of-songs-to-pure-scatological-mayhem.  But don't worry, they weren't through.</p>
<p>If the debut's exposure seemed disproportionately wide, 1993's <i>Pop Tatari</i> was a veritable ""hit.""  It     garnered them enough publicity to land a spot on 1994's Lollapalooza festival-- on the main stage, no less!     However, while their music had become a shade less disgusting since <i>Onanie Bomb</i>, it was hardly fit     for the grunge generation.  <i>Pop Tatari</i> reveled in cock-rock moves and punk bravado.  Boredoms had     settled into a bizarre routine of short-attention span hardcore, acidic funk and cartoonish, performance     art-rap.  Yamamoto breaks out his wah-wah on the last track while Yoshimi and Yoshikawa get brutal; they     rip Led Zeppelin's riffs and Can's song titles with ""Which DooYoo Like?""; they seem incapable of playing     the most basic hardcore riff on ""Hey Bore Hey"", yet all but invent Melt-Banana in the process.</p>
<p><i>Pop Tatari</i> also makes the argument that Boredoms were one of the pre-eminent users (or abusers) of     the studio as instrument.  Their mixes are all over the places, with seemingly random spikes in volume or     shifts in texture, yet rather than come out muddy, <i>Pop Tatari</i> seems almost psychedelic in its surreal     squelching of disparate musical references, baroque in its thousands of blunt details.  ""Bo Go"" is as much     Captain Beefheart as it is the Red Hot Chili Peppers; ""Bore Now Bore"" stomps on Devo while employing Merzbow-esque     reverb and Yellow Magic Orchestra synthesizer.  The epic ""Cory &amp; the Mandara Suicide Pyramid Action or Gas     Satori"" takes all comers with hazy dub reggae, and eventually blasts off into Godzilla explosions via huge,     bottom-heavy drums and scream-verse that should have made 90s rap-rock obsolete before it started.  A     classic.</p>
<p>It's not as though Boredoms had to further prove their insanity by this point, but to any doubters, 1994's     hard-as-fuck <i>Chocolate Synthesizer</i> served notice that something was seriously wrong in Osaka.     Cock-rock was replaced by scraping feedback and distorted tribal jaunts; gone were the strange rap attempts,     replaced by abrasive no-wave textures and chanted monster vocals with trumpets singing battle cries.

Despite     opposing my sworn allegiances to Led Zeppelin and Funkadelic, the Osaka collective is one of the few to     flirt with me at all points in its existence.  After their turn-of-the-century string of cosmic trance     punk efforts, I had even less trouble convincing people these guys (and a gal) were great.  However,     their earliest releases still have yet to attract hordes; some fans think they're the real bore-attraction,     but they're often derailed as chaotic goof-fests.  As I see it, you need this Boredoms to really appreciate     today's ""Vooredoms,"" to hear all the shit that went down before they found the sun.  Better still, most of     it fucking rocks.  Isn't that a nice bonus?</p>
<p>Boredoms actually began as a Yamatsuka Eye bedroom-recording project, represented on the long gone <i>Anal     by Anal</i> EP, which was later appended to the band's first full-length release outside of Japan, <i>Onanie     Bomb Meets the Sex Pistols</i> (a variation on their Japanese debut, <i>Osorezan No Stooges Kyo</i>, or     <i>The Stooges' Craze in Osorezan</i>).  Eye had earned an infamous reputation in the mid-80s as part of     an extreme noise/no-wave band called The Hanatarash, an outfit that fused performance art, post-hardcore     antipathy and self-destruction into one violent, messy bolt of shock and awe.  Hanatarash recordings could     veer anywhere from pure noise to primitive synth squealing to frantic DJ cutups using Rush samples, and     were not only a direct forecast of Boredoms, but of 90s ""Japanoise"" in general.</p>
<p>After recording the ""anal trilogy"" on his own (consisting of ""Anal Eater"", ""God from Anal"" and ""Born to     Anal"", appended to the end of <i>Onanie Bomb</i>), Eye formed his ""rock"" band Boredoms, with Hanatarash     member Taketani on drums, guitarist Mara Tabata (later of Zeni Geva), and bassist Hosoi.  Toyohito Yoshikawa     soon replaced Taketani, and when Tabata quit, Eye asked his friend Seiichi Yamamoto to join.  The two had     briefly played in another band together, along with future Boredoms bassist Hira, though Yamamoto didn't     initially think Eye would be a very compatible musical partner.  Perhaps he was concerned about Eye's     history of destroying pets and demolishing clubs during his Hanatarash days.  Fittingly, this     incarnation of the band recorded its first LP in a self-described ""messy studio,"" preparing the grotesque,     sprawling punk emissions of their early days.</p>
<p>1988's <i>Onanie Bomb Meets the Sex Pistols</i> (""onanie"" being Japanese slang for ""female masturbation"")     was the overseas version of Boredoms' first album, featuring all of <i>Osorezan No Stooges Kyo</i> and     <i>Anal by Anal</i>.  Released on WEA in Japan and Reprise in the U.S., <i>Onanie Bomb</i> began the trend     of Boredoms albums qualifying as the one of the strangest ever released on a major label.  Much like Germany's     Faust in the early 70s, Boredoms were thrust into an alternative rock spotlight despite playing ""music"" that,     even by the band's appraisal (other members complained that Eye's final mix of their first record bore little     resemblance to what they'd originally recorded), was hard to take.</p>
<p>American experimentalists Sonic Youth and John Zorn were quick to champion the band, and former     Bongwater/Butthole Surfers bassist Kramer would release 1989's <i>Soul Discharge</i> on his Shimmy     Disc imprint.  But well-known fans by no means make <i>Onanie Bomb</i> more palatable: Exhibits include     Eye's anal trilogy, with percussion supplied by a drumming instruction cassette, under which Eye screams,     shrieks and squirts to his heart's content.  ""Born to Anal"" features angular guitar work from former member     Tabata, and comes out like a badly recorded DNA demo fronted by someone who's being tattooed on the forehead.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, on ""Boredoms, Vs, SDI"", the group drops their patented sludgy, post-Stooges take on acid-rock     while Eye growls and screams to beat the band.  Musically, Boredoms weren't then far from early Melvins,     though their flare for grossing listeners out was without peer-- hang on for the last, semi-digestible     minute of ""Young Assouls"" at your peril.  At that point, they might have been best summed up by their own     titles, ""No Core Punk"" and ""Feedbackfuck"", though ""Lick'n Cock Boatpeople"" arguably gives the best idea of     what <i>Onanie Bomb</i> is about.</p>
<p>Later in 1988, Yoshimi P-We replaced Yoshikawa (who stayed on as co-vocalist) on drums, and would first     appear on 1989's <i>Soul Discharge</i>-- and it's too bad that record wasn't included in this wave of     reissues, because it's otherwise easiest available only as a single track containing its ten songs on     Shimmy Disc's <i>Soul Discharge/Early Boredoms</i> release.  It's certainly a better introduction to the     first stage of Boredoms than <i>Onanie Bomb</i>, with better recording quality and a more palatable ratio     of sort-of-songs-to-pure-scatological-mayhem.  But don't worry, they weren't through.</p>
<p>If the debut's exposure seemed disproportionately wide, 1993's <i>Pop Tatari</i> was a veritable ""hit.""  It     garnered them enough publicity to land a spot on 1994's Lollapalooza festival-- on the main stage, no less!     However, while their music had become a shade less disgusting since <i>Onanie Bomb</i>, it was hardly fit     for the grunge generation.  <i>Pop Tatari</i> reveled in cock-rock moves and punk bravado.  Boredoms had     settled into a bizarre routine of short-attention span hardcore, acidic funk and cartoonish, performance     art-rap.  Yamamoto breaks out his wah-wah on the last track while Yoshimi and Yoshikawa get brutal; they     rip Led Zeppelin's riffs and Can's song titles with ""Which DooYoo Like?""; they seem incapable of playing     the most basic hardcore riff on ""Hey Bore Hey"", yet all but invent Melt-Banana in the process.</p>
<p><i>Pop Tatari</i> also makes the argument that Boredoms were one of the pre-eminent users (or abusers) of     the studio as instrument.  Their mixes are all over the places, with seemingly random spikes in volume or     shifts in texture, yet rather than come out muddy, <i>Pop Tatari</i> seems almost psychedelic in its surreal     squelching of disparate musical references, baroque in its thousands of blunt details.  ""Bo Go"" is as much     Captain Beefheart as it is the Red Hot Chili Peppers; ""Bore Now Bore"" stomps on Devo while employing Merzbow-esque     reverb and Yellow Magic Orchestra synthesizer.  The epic ""Cory &amp; the Mandara Suicide Pyramid Action or Gas     Satori"" takes all comers with hazy dub reggae, and eventually blasts off into Godzilla explosions via huge,     bottom-heavy drums and scream-verse that should have made 90s rap-rock obsolete before it started.  A     classic.</p>
<p>It's not as though Boredoms had to further prove their insanity by this point, but to any doubters, 1994's     hard-as-fuck <i>Chocolate Synthesizer</i> served notice that something was seriously wrong in Osaka.     Cock-rock was replaced by scraping feedback and distorted tribal jaunts; gone were the strange rap attempts,     replaced by abrasive no-wave textures and chanted monster vocals with trumpets singing battle cries.  In a     way, it was a precursor to the primal propulsion of their later records like <i>Super Ae</i>, but Boredoms     were hardly interested in maintaining any kind of trance groove here.  <i>Chocolate Synthesizer</i> was the     final kiss-off to their illustrious past, and they would never again be this unhinged, annoying or     gloriously violent.</p>

He would sit on his porch in California
    and play flute to accompany the songs wafting through in the trees of his backyard.  Dolphy found that if
    he listened closely, he could detect the patterns in the chorus of bird chirps, and he was inspired by the
    way these melodies included notes that landed in between the ridged pitch delineations of his flute.</p><p>
    
    In his later years, composer John Cage did not own a record player or a radio.  He found the idea of
    pre-recorded music to be unbearably dull, and he indulged his listening needs by tuning into the traffic
    noise beneath his New York apartment.  Sirens, voices, tire squeals and engines-- though man-made, the
    sounds were assembled with the indeterminism of nature, a quality Cage sought to emulate by consulting the
    <i>I Ching</i> when structuring his own compositions.</p><p>
    
    What we learn from Dolphy and Cage is that to make music, you first have to listen.  For a series they
    called <i>Met Life</i>, Chicago label Locust Music asked six artists to listen, record, listen again,
    respond, and then compose.  Here's how it worked: The artists were directed to make a field recording
    ranging from 10 to 20 minutes and then record a ""response"" (this could be interpreted any number of ways)
    to said field recording.  The six lovingly packaged CDs of the series collect the results of these
    experiments.  The first volume of the series, reviewed earlier for Pitchfork by Andy Beta, was Keith
    Fullerton Whitman's fine <i>Dartmouth Street Underpass</i>.</p><p>
<b>Au:</b> <i>Recycling</i><br/>
    The Hague provides the roadways, brass band parades, favorite pubs, and civilian chatter that Au capture
    over the course of their 16-minute active field recording-- ""active"" because the duo of Jan Borchers
    and Paul Klaui are riding microphone-equipped bicycles throughout the city to mine its sounds.  Much more
    than the other releases in the <i>Met Life</i> series, Au's recording, ""Cycling"", is a remarkably cinematic
    one: On one hand, they can't control the sounds that occur in the city, but on the other they can and do
    film them discriminately to make sure at least one sound is more prominent than the rest-- as proof, it
    sounds like they even brake for a few moments to give the brass fanfares their due.  Other times, we only
    hear a pleasant spray of spinning spokes, and from this we may assume Au are going out of their way to
    present dynamically different environments in The Hague.</p><p>
    
    The field recording benefits from their smart sculpts.  Their subsequent remix, ""Recycling"", does not alter
    the time or continuity of the original.  Instead, Au opt for complementary ambient stylings via Borchers'
    gentle guitar line and Klaui's electronics, which are alternately pleasant to correspond with the loud
    moments on ""Cycling"" that speak for themselves, and brooding to accompany less momentous passages that are
    so quiet it's kind of creepy.</p><p>
<b>Reynols:</b> <i>Rampotanza Grodo Rempelente</i><br/>
    The field recording here is no great shakes.  To bring the sound of the street to life you need a certain
    amount of fidelity, and this walk among construction workers in Buenos Aires sounds vague and distant.  It
    was recorded in 1994, perhaps on substandard equipment.  The best that can be said of it is that there
    seems to be a lot going on back there somewhere, and listening to the field recording while walking around
    your own city can be profoundly disorienting.</p><p>
    
    The response track compensates to a degree.  It begins with creaks and groans, as the piercing jackhammer
    sounds and voices calling out to be heard above the traffic seem are tucked into place amid surges of
    feedback.  And the last half finds the street noise joining the three men of Reynols in a strange jam that
    could be the soundtrack to a circus nightmare.  Some machine clanking occasionally stands in for percussion,
    and the voices of the workers are shaped to fit with Reynols' warped vision.  But most of the sound is
    Reynols going it alone, performing a surreal march back through the same torn-up streets.</p><p>
<b>Erdem Helvacioglu:</b> <i>A Walk Through the Bazaar</i><br/>
    An open marketplace in Istanbul is Erdem Helvacioglu's chosen setting.  Helvacioglu captures the overlapping
    voices and middle-distance commotion beautifully.  The clear and detailed audio snapshot, which features
    vendors hawking their wares, families humming together as they stroll past, and music bleeding in from a
    nearby boombox, is as richly revealing as a well-framed photograph.  The opening section of the response
    track finds Helvacioglu crafting his own soundscape by mixing beautiful drones with well-placed samples
    from the bazaar.  Eventually, some beats join in and the track grows upbeat and hectic, but Helvacioglu is
    careful to preserve the dreamy mood established by the introduction.  The effect of hearing voices that
    became so familiar in the opening track blending with the music is striking, like the musical realization
    of a recovered memory.</p><p>
<b>Chris Delaurenti:</b> <i>The Night I Met Maria C_____</i><br/>
    It's a shame that this disc is such a one-trick pony: Seattle's Chris Delaurenti first records 16 minutes at
    the Wallingford Transfer Station, a waste factory, and then for his response piece, pieces together the
    most salient parts of a night out drinking-- getting ""wasted"".  That Delaurenti makes the pun is bad enough;
    that he actualizes it to this extent is almost completely asinine.  The content of both recordings makes for
    some of the series' most boring stuff, though content here was always secondary to Delaurenti's silly joke.
    That said, the bit where Delaurenti records himself urinating is, to a degree, touching.</p><p>
<b>Matmos:</b> <i>Rat Relocation Program</i><br/>
    When a street rat crashed the Matmos pad, made noise late at night, and nibbled away at their food and
    threads, the duo of Drew Daniel and Martin Schmidt were faced with potential hypocrisy-- they couldn't
    kill the rodent because, in fact, they were keeping another as a pet.  As a compromise, they decided to
    catch it in a cage and record its protests: angry metallic rattling, pained wails, and the long and
    terrifying silence that spans their irregularity.  It's a torturous listen.</p><p>
    
    The relationship between vast silence and the rat's shrill rant becomes the centerpoint for Matmos'
    response piece, ""Rat Relocation"".  The duo keeps the field recording completely intact, and instead, with
    breakneck cut-ups and drills of noise, they attempt to heighten the degree to which the rat shatters the
    listener's peace.  Tense swells and foreboding slurps are the initial enhancements, before the response of
    Schmidt's bass solo begins to viciously compete with the rat's squeals.  The match-up is somewhat absurd,
    but the changing tides of this farcical battle seem to redeem what could have seemed a truly heartless
    response piece had it not existed at all.</p></div>"|2048.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2048-met-life-series-2-6/|7.3|Mark Richardson & Nick Sylvester

    less abrasive Billy Corgan or a less earthy Mike Scott, but when he heads for the upper registers, it
    sounds startling and strikingly androgynous.  His voice may not possess much discernible grit or soul,
    and it may not be unique-- he's taking cues from Jeff Buckley and the Cocteau Twins' Elizabeth Fraser--
    but it is still unusual and powerful, perfect for the Delays' dreamy pop.  For better or for worse, the
    vocals are the most singularly compelling element on the band's debut, <i>Faded Seaside Glamour</i>.</p><p>
    
    Hailing from Southampton, the Delays were first incarnated as Corky, an outfit, the band readily confesses,
    that played run-of-the-mill acoustic Britpop.  They regrouped as the Delays and purposefully distanced
    themselves from their former scene, eventually gaining more-than-modest success in England-- a top 20
    album and tours with Tim Burgess and The Sleepy Jackson.</p><p>
    
    To their credit, the Delays try never to rely on Gilbert's pipes to justify themselves.  They work to
    bolster their ephemeral sound with studied songcraft and an array of touchstones ranging from 60s pop to
    <i>120 Minutes</i> alternative.  The muted piano on ""Bedroom Scene"" recalls <i>War</i>-era U2, the melody
    and chorus of ""Long Time Coming"" late-period Waterboys.  Greg's brother Aaron Gilbert programs the sampled
    steel drums on ""Wanderlust"" to serve the same purpose as the elaborate guitar feedback on My Bloody Valentine's
    <i>Loveless</i>.</p><p>
    
    The Delays' commitment to playing as a cohesive unit is admirable, if not altogether advisable: Despite some
    strong ideas and a few memorable songs, <i>Faded Seaside Glamour</i> remains notable mostly for the vocals:
    the album's ups and downs follow Gilbert's voice almost exactly, best when he's hitting high notes, mundane
    when he's not.  Displaying a restraint that is perhaps not the best tactic here, he doesn't go all Mariah
    on every song, but the album's best songs-- ""Wanderlust"" and ""Nearer Than Heaven""-- shamelessly push his
    vocals to the forefront while the band provide inventive, unobtrusive accompaniment.  As <i>Faded Seaside
    Glamour</i> progresses, however, he tones down his performance considerably, which drains songs like ""No
    Ending"" and ""Bedroom Scene"" of their dreamy drama.</p><p>
    
    Nothing quite clicks as well as those first two songs, when the careening vocals excuse the gushy lyrics.
    Lyrics, obviously, aren't the band's forte, and Gilbert's falsetto usually obscures what he's expressing
    with it, which proves advantageous.  The songs typically center around blotchy sentiment (""The air is thin
    and hard to breathe/ The sweetness that you lost to me/ Despite the noose around our kiss/ I try to tell
    myself this is/ No ending"") or Hallmark philosophizing (""How can you grow old/ You were not trying?"") that
    ultimately breaks the mood of the music.</p><p>
    
    Curiously, one of the Delays' best tracks doesn't even appear on the album: ""Zero Zero One"", a B-side to
    ""Hey Girl"", features no lyrics at all, just Gilbert oooh-ing and ahhh-ing around the upper registers while
    the band-- especially Aaron Gilbert and bassist Colin Fox-- break out the canned strings and the slow-dancing
    rhythm section.  It's three minutes of atmosphere in search of a soundtrack, but it focuses so closely on
    the band's strengths that it gets them farther from their original Britpop and nearer to heaven than
    anything on <i>Faded Seaside Glamour</i>.</p></div>"|2557.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2557-faded-seaside-glamour/|6.0|Stephen M. Deusner

    in a decidedly folk art milieu.  In addition to running a website (www.yarddog.com) to sell his and others'
    pieces, he has illustrated almost all of his recent albums with his own folk-inspired work, in which Dia
    de los Muertos skeletons predominate.  The cover of his latest, <i>All the Fame of Lofty Deeds</i>, shows
    a grinning skull in a Grand Ol' Opry suit, its fleshy hands holding a guitar, flanked by two blindfolded
    sidemen.  Scribbled like graffiti, a thought balloon expresses his cryptic thought: ""I quit!""</p><p>
    
    But Langford is entirely too well-connected to be the kind of American outsider this type of artwork implies:
    He is, after all, signed to Bloodshot Records, and has collaborated with scores of artists in a variety of
    projects, among them the Pine Valley Cosmonauts, which recorded three volumes of anti-death-penalty songs
    featuring Steve Earle, Neko Case, Kurt Wagner, and Rhett Miller, among others.  As a solo artist, he has
    worked with Alejandro Escovedo, Kelly Hogan, The Sadies, and Jon Rauhouse.  His music falls squarely in an
    American country music tradition, and he has released full-album tributes to both Johnny Cash and Bob Wills.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, Langford knows he's no outsider. He uses folk art tropes the same way hipsters wear Ramones
    t-shirts-- as something to aspire to, a totem for something more real and meaningful than the here and now.
    Envisioned as a concept album about a rags-to-riches-to-obscurity country music journeyman (a reading
    trumpeted more loudly by the press release than by the album itself), <i>All the Fame of Lofty Deeds</i>
    paints a cantankerously bleak picture of the present moment, lamenting the sad state of country music and
    American politics.  He culls these 11 songs from disparate sources: In addition to the Procol Harum and Bob
    Wills covers (""Homberg"" and the lovely sign-off ""Trouble in Mind"", respectively), the album includes two
    tracks backed by the Pine Valley Cosmonauts and another by Hillbilly Lovechild.  He also throws in a ""fast
    version"" of ""Nashville Radio"" and a new take on ""Going Over the Cliff"".</p><p>
    
    Through these and other songs Langford suggests that freedom and justice reign only in the margins of
    society, where artists can clearly view the corruption of the center.  ""The Country Is Young"" compares
    America to a spoiled infant: ""Just crawled to its feet/ Takes a step and collapses.""  It's a thin metaphor
    to draw out over a full song, but Langford realizes its comic potential: ""You gotta wipe its fat ass and
    buy it some toys/ Not too big on the sharing.""</p><p>
    
    But <i>All the Fame of Lofty Deeds</i> isn't a wholly political album; about half the songs speak to
    Langford's contentious relationship with country music.  The title track laments the hollowness of celebrity,
    while ""Nashville Radio"", the only song here that directly deals with the concept-album narrative, plays even
    better as a music veterans' indictment of a rootless system that insists its roots are strong and deep.
    ""Going Over the Cliff"" shows the stakes in the business are recklessly high: ""Success on someone else's
    terms don't mean a fuckin' thing/ I'm going over the cliff.""  It's all or-- more likely-- nothing.</p><p>
    
    To ignore the concept album pretensions of <i>All the Fame of Lofty Deeds</i> is easy enough, especially
    since Langford ostensibly did not write the songs to fit the concept, but devised the concept to fit the
    songs.  In its hardscrabble arrangement the album does manage to capture the art-for-art's-sake spontaneity
    attributed to true folk art.  In this regard, Langford's outrage over the state of country music and the
    world cannot overcome his genuine excitement in absorbing his beloved influences, jotting down some great
    lyrics and some hummable melodies, corralling a herd of talented musicians, and making music that is
    intelligent, angry, and most surprisingly, fun.  Lofty deeds, indeed.</p></div>"|4681.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4681-all-the-fame-of-lofty-deeds/|8.4|Stephen M. Deusner

    performing as Mr. Magic.  The backbeat for what was, in fact, New England's first hip-hop track, ""Rappin'
    with Mr. Magic"", sounds remarkably like the break from Chic's ""Good Times"", famously sampled by New York
    City's Sugarhill Gang for 1979's ""Rapper's Delight"".  Magic's beat is not ""Good Times""-- it's actually a
    live band re-recording of Vaughn Mason's ""Bounce, Rock, Skate...""-- but his track's similarity to ""Rapper's
    Delight"", which is generally considered the first successful hip-hop single ever, seems a boldly confrontational
    move.</p><p>
    
    Lyrically, the parallels are even more apparent.  Mr. Magic, who built the Southern Connecticut hip-hop
    scene on his own after hearing Kurtis Blow's ""Christmas Rappin'"", spends nine minutes defending the rap
    abilities of the Constitution State, concluding with an ode to loyalty: a roll call of Connecticut towns.
    Magic's point is that the Connecticut scene could step to anything coming out of NYC, and while that may
    not have been completely true, CT did produce a worthwhile crop.</p><p>
    
    New York, of course, never really got on the commuter rail to check out Mr. Magic, or Pookey Blow, or The
    Outlaw Four, or Willie Brown &amp; Woodie.  In fact, the City itself was close enough that if aspiring
    Connecticut rappers really wanted to be a part of the New York scene, it wasn't such a hassle to move
    there-- much of Southern Connecticut commuted to work in New York anyway.  It's reasonable to assume,
    then, that Mr. Magic's scene was extremely committed to itself, yet still reaped the benefits of New York's
    close proximity-- it was an insular scene, but not devoid of influences.</p><p>
    
    Which, along with the downright fantastic tracks recovered here, is what makes this compilation is so
    fascinating.  With <i>The Third Unheard</i>, Stones Throw's Egon and Peanut Butter Wolf perform two great
    services to hip-hop.  First, they successfully reconstruct an extremely talented and fiercely loyal musical
    scene that was clearly part of the early New York old school, even if the Big Apple didn't actively assume
    so.  Secondly, the tracks on <i>The Third Unheard</i> are gloriously littered with quotes from early old
    school New York singles, which in itself implies that even early on, hip-hop was extremely conscious of
    genre.</p><p>
    
    So that's the historical stuff; obviously, though, the tracks here are fun as hell.  Mr. Magic's introduction
    is followed by two tracks from Magic's 12-year-old nephew Pookey Blow: one of them, ""Get Up (And Go to School)""
    samples the heavy auxiliary percussion and sparse guitar hits of Herman Kelly's ""Dance to the Drummer's Beat"",
    adding some cartoon-dreary synth and kazoo solos, all while Pookey laments being in school, falling asleep
    in English class, and wasting time when he could be rapping.  In the end, though, Pookey agrees with the
    title's directive: ""You gotta go to school and learn all you can, if you wanna be the president of""-- I
    think (and hope)-- ""Japan.""  Mr. Magic takes the kazoo shtick one step further on house-party song ""2001
    Kazoos"", for which he recruits the Positive Choice band to back his own rap and even more persistent synths,
    whistles, and kazoo choruses.</p><p>
    
    The Outlaw Four's ""Million Dollar Legs"" boasts one of the comp's catchier choruses (""Just dance to the
    rhythm of The Outlaw Four!"") and perhaps its thickest groove, not to mention plenty of individual gems
    (""How you doin' pretty mama?  It ain't no thing/ If you wear your panty hose with the static cling""). The
    song finds its counterpart in the equally catchy ""Shake Your Booty"" by the 3 Chillie MCs, whose open desire
    for wealth and recognition marks a shift in tone from the rest of the disc: ""We've paid our debt, we did our
    time/ Now we're here to make money off our rhyme.""  Clearly, <i>The Third Unheard</i>'s most bizarre track
    is Willie Brown &amp; Woodie's ""Ventriloquist Rap"", where, in fact, Willie and his puppet Woodie trade verses
    over Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's ""Best of My Love"", anticipating the schizophrenia Madlib feigns with Quasimoto
    on Madvillain's ""America's Most Blunted"".</p><p>
    
    If nothing else, <i>The Third Unheard</i> is an extremely refreshing return to the carefree spirit and
    high-level energy of hip-hop's formative stages.  Unburdened by tradition during this early era, Mr. Magic
    and the Southern Connecticut scene dove headlong into excitement, blissfully unconcerned with the potential
    influence or importance of their recordings-- let alone whether their art might one day evolve into pop
    music's most visible form.</p></div>"|2003.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2003-the-third-unheard-connecticut-hip-hop-1979-1983/|8.5|Nick Sylvester

<i>We are the puzzle pieces who seldom fit with other puzzle pieces.  We inhabit singledom as our natural
    resting state.  We are, by force of our personalities and inner strength, rebels.</i></p><p>
    
    It would be better to be untethered and open to possibility, living for the exhilaration of meeting someone
    new, of not knowing what the night will bring.  We seek momentous meetings.</p><p>
    
    In 1999, with her definitive Quirkyalone manifesto, Cagen fleshed out a latent character type that's
    quintessentially millennial and unarguably valid.  Mass media grabbed the term and launched a Lifestyle
    Section carnival of pop psychology that very quickly established an unlikely solidarity among thousands
    of deliberate, socially skeptical free agents around the world.  The QAs, we've been informed, are here.
    I'm betting Eltro is the soundtrack to all their long solitary walks and microwave dinners for one.</p><p>
    
    Somewhat identified with the heady Psychedelphia scene that's hit stride over the last few years, Eltro
    keep the beats fuzzy, the digital effects swarming, and the lyrics mostly unintelligible.  But where groups
    like Asteroid #4 and the Three 4 Tens wig out with acid-test guitar and throwback harmonized vocals, Eltro
    rely heavily on ambient percussion and textured repetition to steer their midnight drive.  Like Cagen's
    Quirkyalones, Eltro is ""untethered and open to possibility,"" working from a vast and mysterious palette
    of modern synthesized styles.  <i>Past and Present Futurists</i>, their third LP on Berkeley's Absolutely
    Kosher label, arrives at some enthralling twists of crispy, catchy minimalism and offers glimpses of
    unbridled creativity.  Due to a diffuse stylistic focus and somewhat flimsy lo-fi production, however,
    the album arrives at only a precious few of those truly ""momentous meetings"" that drive the Quirkyalone
    solo mission.</p><p>
    
    That said, <i>Futurists</i> stages enough intriguing encounters to make the album an eccentric, somnambulant
    thrill-- not unlike nodding off at a strip club.  The droning trip-pop of ""Love Is on the Right"" rustles
    over sleep-deprived vocal harmonies from husband/wife songwriting team Diana Prescott and Jorge Sandrini.
    Their blissed-out vocals also lift the guitar-driven ""Lady of the Highway"" to inebriated heights, as they
    sing of some surreal road trip where ""I was asleep at the wheel/ Lost on the highway/ The radio does as it
    should/ Ghostly transmissions are taking me further away.""  The song builds to a low-wattage crescendo, Rick
    Henderson's subdued, reverential organ paired with Sandrini's guitar cranked up to about six.  It's a
    beautiful slice of dream-pop, concise and moving, and sounds unlike anything else on the album.</p><p>
    
    The other high point comes with the absolutely inexplicable ""Fram"", a jagged gouge of electro dance-punk
    cat scratch that also stands stylistically alone as the only ass-mover on an album of barely conscious
    beats.  Whether Prescott's singing of a new oil filter on her Funkmobile or a replacement tube for her
    bass amp is hard to say, as she sing/speaks, ""I need adapters for both sides/ I need a small reel for the
    outside/ I need Fram.""  Riiight.  But the lyrics here are purely ornamental, gabbling utterances reminiscent
    of !!! minus the testosterone.  ""Fram"" hypnotizes with a bobbing bassline, stringy guitar, industrial
    percussion samples, and creaking horn slices that, despite their solitary, individual drive, manage to
    find each other in an undeniable groove.  It's an improbable commingling that works wonderfully, and it
    just might be enough to give hope to the perennially single.</p></div>"|2763.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2763-past-and-present-futurists/|7.1|Jonathan Zwickel

    was ""the best ever.""  That's not surprising: When your age is still a single digit, the present generally
    eclipses any strong sense of past or future.  But when kids grow up, develop deeper frames of reference,
    and start smashing grasshoppers on the way home from school, such naive of-the-moment idealism seems more
    cloying and creepy than aw-shucks cute.</p><p>
    
    Jason Anderson's reference to a girl, a moment, or something else as ""the best Christmas ever"" on <i>New
    England</i>'s final track is therefore the sweetie-pie, slacker wisdom epiphany that broke the camel's
    back.  What's more, in true K Records fashion, once that sentimental sentiment moseys from Anderson's
    quivering lips, a besotted Muppet choir chimes in to let us know that ""everything whispers 'I love you.'""
    That mesh of the misshapen grandiosity of high-school poetry and the stubborn details of an insulated
    journal is, unfortunately, signature Anderson.</p><p>
    
    Known best as the pop/rock mind behind Wolf Colonel, Anderson played drums for Yume Bitsu, toured with The
    Microphones, and sat-in with Little Wings.  Here, he teams with Phil Elvrum, who produces and adds bass,
    guitar, drums, and lends vocals to ""Thanksgiving"" and the semi-upbeat ""You Fall"", and in each case, the
    duo tosses around in-crowd references to various forms of sinking, sagging, or going down.  Anderson is
    less metaphorically dense than Elvrum.  Instead, he's given to prolonged first-person flights and the
    blatantly diaristic.  The minimalist verbiage of the melancholic, earthy <i>New England</i> shares a link
    with the confessional per-zines of the early-to-mid 90s, offering a blend of the embarrassing, the
    off-handedly endearing, and occasionally, the wise.</p><p>
    
    Anderson also receives contributions from other K regulars such as Mirah, The Blow's Khaela Maricich, and
    Yume Bitsu's Adam Forkner.  Mirah's breathy contribution to the piano-based ""A Book Laid on Its Binding""
    fleshes out the track's soporific lilt, which approximates Conor Oberst caught in the headlights of an
    off-Broadway musical dream sequence.  (For a similar but more successful example of this dewy vibe, check
    out Eric Trip's decade-old <i>Love Tara</i>.)  Even when he has company, Anderson still sounds lonesome--
    like an everyman archiving fears and hopes and relishing simple moments.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, Anderson stumbles.  The nine-minute, codeine-inspired monologue ""Pen Pals"" is patience-testing.
    It features 20-plus sentence fragments touching on familial distance, collegiate emptiness, last kisses,
    various forms of departure (death, drives to the airport), time, and the letdown of in-person meetings.
    I'll admit Anderson manages some decent one-liners, but even if you handed Leonard Cohen this entropic
    pace and stale phrasing and asked him to bring down the house, the results would still be a good night's
    sleep.</p><p>
    
    In the end, despite the forced poetry, it's the lack of memorable melodies that sinks Anderson's project.
    Lesson to be learned: Just 'cause you say it slow and moody, develop a plotline, mention Elliott Smith,
    and have a girl with amazing smelling hair doesn't mean your songs work.</p></div>"|442.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/442-new-england/|5.0|Brandon Stosuy

    songs and constructing earthquaking riffs in their heads; they certainly never learned how to pluralize
    nouns ending in ""y.""  Fortunately, the members of this Chicago quartet are putting the skills they picked
    up during their rock 'n' roll fantasies to good use these days.  <i>Laced with Romance</i>, the group's
    debut long-player, jubilantly embraces cozily familiar riffs, stylized torrents of fuzzed-out guitars,
    and giddy, high-tension basslines.</p><p>
    
    What sets <i>Laced with Romance</i> apart from the abundance of garage-rock albums released over the past
    few years is its ample possession of groove, by turns big and heavy or loose and sloppy.  The record's 12
    tracks display a deep understanding of basic rhythm, something direly lacking among the current crop of
    throwback acts.  Ponys drummer Nathan Jerde reliably hammers every backbeat, but the propulsive silence
    of his ghost notes is what truly drives these songs.  Likewise, Melissa Elias' high-register, Adderall-driven
    basslines provide a sturdy yet pliant foundation upon which <i>Laced with Romance</i> can traipse.</p><p>
    
    Earnestly enthusiastic and studiously honed, The Ponys are a true anachronism: Rather than shoddily updating
    a proven style under the artistic aegis of supposed newness, they reiterate classic mod-rock with uncanny
    accuracy.  ""Little Friends"" is as soulful a song as you're bound to hear from a group of white musicians,
    while ""Fall Inn"" spins a classic pop riff with invigorating sincerity.  Jered Gummere's vacillating, slyly
    affected vocals add a slightly punkish edge to the music, which-- despite an unwieldy, live-radio sound--
    often leans toward unadulterated pop in Ian Adams' flippant organ melodies.  The not-so-subtly self-effacing
    opener ""Let's Kill Ourselves"" accomplishes the tricky feat of sounding evasively and ultimately unidentifiably
    redolent.  Eventually, one grows weary of trying to place exactly ""where that damn riff comes from,"" and
    accepts the song at its immensely pleasurable face value.</p><p>
    
    The Ponys have also mastered the formula for writing indelible songs that aren't cloying or overtly filched.
    Despite its unabashedly derivative sound, <i>Laced with Romance</i> is authentic enough in its fossilized
    antiquity to suffice even the most hardened purist.  Moreover, it's ridiculously fun, and a heady reminder
    of why this brand of straightforward rock never grows old.  Sure, for every traumatic high school poet, art
    school flunky, and lifelong coffeeshop musician, there's a crummy rock band bastardizing the form.</p><p>
    
    Still, those slipshod groups are what simultaneously help rock achieve importance: If people care enough
    about something to spend their whole lives being bad at it, there must be something great inspiring all that
    myopic futility.  <i>Laced with Romance</i> will surely contribute to more dross than valuable works like
    itself; but in doing so, it only affirms rock music's significance.  And despite your feelings about the
    genre and its unending supply of offal, when a record is as galvanizing as this, who really gives a shit

    shaky Delta blues, big American soul, and sweaty Detroit R&amp;B.;  So it hardly seems a surprise that the
    Snakes' scruffy vocalist, Andre Ethier, has released a solo debut (with the help of pianist Christopher
    Sandes and rhythm section Pickles and Price) that applies the exact same preoccupations to mid-1970s
    piano-folk?  The resulting record is more restrained, focused, and narrative than anything in The Deadly
    Snakes' explosive discography-- but, happily, it's not much quieter.</p><p>
    
    All of the tracks are first-takes, peppered with tiny mistakes and glib, spontaneous gurgles. Subsequently,
    the record is pleasantly disjointed-- a creaky and fragmented smattering of story-songs.  Ethier's vocal
    gymnastics are often compared to Bob Dylan's, and while their respective pipes may overlap in tone and
    syntax, it's the pair's shared affinity for bleak-but-soulful growls that ultimately seals the analogy.
    Ethier's deep, whiskey-soaked caterwauls (""I've slept beneath rocks and trees/ Out in the clover with the
    honeybees/ Won't you let me put my suitcase down?"") are hollow and heartfelt, riddled with emotion but
    delivered with damp, blank-faced apathy.</p><p>
    
    Backed by Christopher Sandes' expert, diddling piano lines,
    Ethier's acoustic guitar and ukulele, and Pickles and Price's upright bass and drums, Ethier's vocals
    somehow become the stubborn centerpiece of nearly every track: mesmerizing, weird and totally raucous.
    But despite all the Dylan overlap, Ethier's debut is still more an unapologetic homage to Randy Newman than
    a ""New Dylan"" potshot: Sandes' piano noodling, when wed with Ethier's guttural rumbles, points directly to
    mid-70s Randy, matching piano balladry with misfit storytelling. </p><p>
    
    Ethier perfectly embodies the overeducated-outlaw archetype (see: Hunter S. Thompson), entertaining and
    irritating women (""I've been a fool and philistine for you/ Please don't make me sleep out in the cold""),
    eschewing the law, and forging on and on.  His songs are populated by a revolving cast of erstwhile,
    parcel-toting vagrants (see: Crazy May, Dirty Dave) who may or may not be wearing shoes-- sinners who
    lob rocks at giant wasp's nests and crush insects with their boot heels while dice fly high, cash is
    rolled tight, and no one ever seems to know or remember where they're supposed to be sleeping that night.
    It's all rough road stories and rollicking piano fills-- everyone uses a jacket as a pillow and curls up
    to snooze with one eye open, twitching themselves asleep to sound of gently brushed drums and Ethier's
    throaty whispers.  There are far worse ways to crash.</p></div>"|2906.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2906-with-christopher-sandes-featuring-pickles-and-price/|8.2|Amanda Petrusich

    Come on, boy/ Be a jubilee.""  That word, ""jubilee,"" hangs heavy with meaning.  Commonly connoting a commemorative
    celebration, this Biblical term also refers to a period of emancipation for Hebrew slaves.  It was adopted
    by the abolition movement in the 1800s and by the civil rights movement a century later.  And it says a lot
    more about the album and Smith's intentions than the title <i>Trampin'</i> does: Mixing the personal and
    the political, she examines her own and the country's past while inciting activism in the present-- a
    jubilee as both remembrance and protest.</p><p>
    
    If any musician can expose the lies of the age and urge her listeners to action, it's Smith: She started as
    a visual and dramatic artist in the late 1960s, when activism was swelling at college campuses across the
    country; in the early 1970s, when the previous decade's revolutionaries went underground, she put her poetry
    to Lenny Kaye's guitar and created a highly idiosyncratic form of punk that bore surprising longevity.  Her
    early albums still sound fiery and fidgety, resisting the genre gentrification that has desanguinated her
    contemporaries, but on <i>Trampin'</i>, she is so preoccupied with the past that she fails to adequately
    capture the present.</p><p>
    
    As for the past, <i>Trampin'</i> finds particular inspiration in the civil rights movement: The album's
    title comes from a spiritual made famous by Marian Anderson, which Smith lovingly covers at album's end.
    The nine-minute ""Gandhi"" re-creates a childhood illness as the mahatma's defining experience and namechecks
    Martin Luther King Jr., but ends with a more timely imperative: ""Awake from your slumber/ And get 'em with
    the numbers.""</p><p>
<i>Trampin'</i> is Smith at her most deferential: She looks to figures like Gandhi, King, Anderson, and
    even Bob Dylan on ""Stride of the Mind"" for spiritual guidance.  While this approach may be valid and even
    occasionally compelling, for the most part it robs the album of most of its urgency and dulls its outrage.
    In a sense, Smith hides behind these historical leaders, letting their names and legacies stand in place
    of her own anger and reasoning.</p><p>
    
    In comparison to these tracks, the 12-minute epic ""Radio Baghdad"" sounds much braver and riskier, trading
    concision for dramatic vitality.  Less an anti-war poem than a noisy self-exorcism by an American ashamed
    of her country's actions, the song expounds on Baghdad's history, culture and ruin, and conjures the kind
    of righteous fire missing from ""Gandhi"".  Smith yelps ""shock and awe shock and awe"" with such mighty
    defiance and disdain that the words sound hardly human-- it's the fiercest moment on the album.  However,
    Smith, intending each line to be a targeted missile, occasionally lapses into bumper-sticker lyrics like,
    ""We invented the zero/ But we mean nothing to you,"" and, ""Robbing the cradle of civilization,"" whose catchy
    cleverness threatens to undermine the song's message.  It's perhaps a testament to her explosive performance
    that the song ends with a genuine and meaningful catharsis, which Smith manages to sustain through the short,
    elegant title track that follows.</p><p>
    
    Given the complications of the album's political messages, it should be no surprise that the most heartfelt
    and memorable songs on <i>Trampin'</i> are Smith's personal commemorations, like ""Mother Rose"" and ""Trespasses"",
    which are shorter and more traditionally structured.  Smith's late husband, former MC5 guitarist Fred ""Sonic""
    Smith, still haunts her music, as it has on every album since 1996's <i>Gone Again</i>, but here, that
    sadness is leavened by the reassuring presence of her children, both of whom play on the album.  In fact,
    Smith wrote ""Cartwheels"" for her daughter Jesse Paris Smith, who accompanies her mother on piano for the
    title track.</p><p>
    
    These people feel more immediate and more connected to Smith than any of the historical
    figures she tries to summon, so the gravity of her personal life ultimately outweighs the confusion of
    American political life.  They offer the reassurance of security and certainty, of questions with clear-cut
    answers, something she finds in the era of civil rights but not so much in our present-day predicaments.
    What keeps <i>Trampin'</i> from being a failure of imagination is her dogged insistence on searching for
    something solid and sure to bring to the discussion; what she finds may not offer many solutions, but it
    does gravely illustrate the burden of giving a shit in the first place.</p></div>"|7276.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7276-trampin/|7.1|Stephen M. Deusner

You'd think they'd tire quickly, all tucked away on their island, strewn
    about on tree roots while baking their lungs and throats to a knotty green tinge.  But instead of waltzing
    through life like hippies, they manage to not only tour and put out records every year, but also to fill
    those albums with 30-minute jams and assorted freakouts.  And while evil jam bands would fill that space
    with guitar work taken from the Classic Rock Manual of Clichés, Makoto Kawabata and company assault
    listeners with frighteningly dense walls of white noise, psychedelic swirl effects and, yes, even guitar
    solos-- albeit ones that are more Merzbow or Keiji Haino than Gary Rossington.  Truly, AMT's endurance and
    threshold for cosmic lashings are both worthy of admiration.</p><p>
    But how much AMT can you take in one sitting?  If there's anything this band has taught us-- via records
    such as 2002's <i>Electric Heavyland</i> and the ferocious <i>Acid Mothers Temple &amp; the Melting Paraiso
    U.F.O</i>-- it's that they're not afraid to reach for the upper regions of consciousness.  On <i>Mantra
    of Love</i>, they offer two titles over the course of one hour, never faltering along the way, and it's as
    if we listeners are just brief visitors passing through a never-ending, spontaneous group trip.  For all I
    know, Kawabata has hundreds of hours of this stuff on his hard drive-- at any single moment, this record's
    sheer volume of sound is a clamor to behold.  However, if you aren't dialed into that the particular space
    AMT inhabits (for me, it's the mystical fire-baptism standby), you might not hear their glorious noise for
    all the, well, glorious noise.</p><p>
    ""La Le Lo"" begins as a lengthy psychedelic ballad sung by Cotton Casino (who doubles on ""beer &amp; cigarettes""),
    who is accompanied by her own ghostly backing vocals.  The band is playing a mantra as Casino waxes earth-mother
    stylings to the moon.  The serenity is broken by a patented AMT rave led by Kawabata's electric sitar (!)
    solo.  Ace rhythm section Tsuyama Atsushi (""monster bass"") and Koizumi Hajime hold things together, as does
    the generally decent recording quality (not a given for these guys), but the real money is in effects--
    lots and lots effects.  Much like France's Richard Pinhas or AMT's countrymen in Les Rallizes Denudes and
    High Rise, the band understands the collaborative power of solo + overdriven Moog sirens and screams.  And,
    also like those artists, Acid Mothers can go on all night if need be.  About 25 minutes into this piece,
    any hell that hadn't already broken loose gets its due, and the band speeds to a fiery climax before winding
    down into glimmering astro-ambience.</p><p>
    The second track, ""L'Ambition dans le Miroir"", also begins as a minor ballad featuring Casino's haunting
    solo vocal.  The Mothers set her up with a faux-blues drag and a thick buffer of synth-rays; when Casino
    actually enters, she fights for airtime with an array of falling stars and cosmic dust.  However, this
    time there is no overwhelming solo to power the comedown.  Casino intermittently coos in the background
    while droning horns keep the auxiliary pixie haze from evaporating.  As they showed on <i>In C</i> and
    <i>La Novia</i>, AMT are more than adept at creating calmer storms-- listeners just have to catch them
    in the right light.  <i>Mantra of Love</i> doesn't necessarily capture the most inspired moments in their
    canon but as usual with this band's records, it's rarely at a loss for moments of horror or grandeur.</p></div>"|23.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23-mantra-of-love/|6.8|Dominique Leone

Ignored upon their release (presumably due to that awful bandname), the best of     Disco Inferno's early 1990s work has been increasingly championed over the years and seems set to     deservedly make the paperback edition of rock's history books.  A deft mix of creative sampling, tender,     sinewy melodies, and caustic, intelligent lyrics, Disco Inferno were one of the era's most restlessly     creative bands, but drowned in the slipstream of Britpop-fueled nostalgia.  At a time when Beatles worship     and consensus-forming was usurping UK rock's post-Acid House surge of creativity, Disco Inferno understood     that technology needn't be the enemy of guitar-rock and that songcraft and progression aren't oppositional     forces.</p>
<p>After a few promising but unrewarding years as Joy Division clones, Disco Inferno hit upon a seemingly     simple but ultimately world-opening idea: wiring their instruments through samplers.  Instead of merely     engaging in pop-will-eat-itself po-mo by regurgitating elements of records, film dialogue, or other media,     DI engaged with the whole of the world, using their setup to trigger sounds that ranged from running water,     the wind, and whistling birds to stomping boots, car crashes, and angry voices.  The idea is so simple it     almost seems quaint, and had they left it at that, it could have been even gauche or potentially gimmicky.

<p>The approach was folded into DI leader Ian Crause's songs of pre-millennial tension and the results     perfectly exemplified the fractious uncertainty and naïve promise of the post-Cold War world.  Crause     explored the gaps between history, technology and humanity in much the same way he did between art and     reality, sifting through the rubble of a century of cruelty and warfare and being confronted by equal     parts hope and anguish, beauty and cruelty.</p>
<p>The peak of DI's powers came with their series of EPs released between 1992-94-- <i>Summer's Last Sound</i>,     <i>A Rock to Cling To</i>, <i>The Last Dance</i>, <i>Second Language</i>, and <i>It's a Kid's World</i>--     but <i>D.I. Go Pop</i> is nearly as urgent and key.  The most challenging and least ""pop"" full-length in the     band's catalog, <i>D.I. Go Pop</i> retains the arpeggios and fractured melodicism of their then-recent     singles, and adds increasing layers of disorienting samples and paranoia.  Like its misleading title,     <i>D.I. Go Pop</i> is an album of contradictions: Prescient, uneasy ballads like ""Even the Sea Sides     Against Us"" and ""A Whole Wide World Ahead"" recoil from the potential cruelty of human nature but are     tethered by an aching off-kilter beauty.  On much of the album, Crause's bitterness and aggression seems     trapped in a swirl of larger sounds, his voice and fears struggling to be heard or comprehended above     the dins of abstract noise and the weight of the world around him.</p>
<p>If <i>Technicolour</i> offers a far more accessible set of songs, it also makes for a less rewarding listen.     Where Crause swam against the tide in <i>D.I. Go Pop</i>, deeply blurring his track's barest elements with     his samples, the seams are much more evident on <i>Technicolour</i>.  The title track's wall of sound     approach and the punch and backbeat of ""Things Move Fast"" even seem to carry some echoes of (gulp) Oasis.     Elsewhere, the jangle of ""I'm Still in Love"" shifts from windswept loneliness to the chaos of warfare, and     DI even toy with elements of spybeat and disco (""Sleight of Hand"") and whimsy (the single, ""It's a Kid's     World"", which seems to re-imagine ""Lust for Life"" as a medley of children's television show themes).     <i>Technicolour</i> isn't a groundbreaking record like its predecessor-- and in the band's linear history,     was a disappointing step-- but it's still a charming blend of hooks and impressionistic sounds.  And until     someone gets around to reissuing those EPs, it's a fine second step into Disco Inferno's singular world.</p></div>"|2556.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2556-di-go-pop-technicolour/|9.3|Scott Plagenhoef

    it's startling how quickly the premise-- that a young girl can fight and defend herself just as well as
    a man-- has vanished from the airwaves.  Just the next year, two of the biggest television events were the
    biopics of Elizabeth Smart and Jessica Lynch, two young, helpless girls who exist only to be rescued.
    We got a flashback to what we were missing when the <i>Buffy</i> spin-off <i>Angel</i> ended its own run.
    In one scene, a red-faced demon stalks up to a skinny, defenseless-looking brunette and taunts, ""Take your
    best shot, little girl""; the brunette, unimpressed, reels around and throws a fist right through the
    chauvinist demon's face, killing him instantly.</p><p>
    
    PJ Harvey's fans are waiting for her to do much the same thing.  Every time a new album's announced, part
    of her audience hopes she'll step up again as the loudest, boldest female guitar hero.  It's not that Harvey
    sounds tame these days: Her confidence on stage and her edgy glamour have kept pace with her voice, which
    she has developed into one of the most powerful and seductive in rock.  But the blaring guitars of <i>Dry</i>
    and unusual meter of <i>Rid of Me</i> were a quicker fix, and without them, Harvey's studio work grew
    cloistered and difficult.</p><p>
    
    Since 1995's <i>To Bring You My Love</i>, each of her albums has turned off some chunk of her fanbase.  The
    subtle character studies and trip-hop backdrops of <i>Is This Desire?</i> struck some as cold or dissonant,
    and her John Parish collaboration, <i>Dance Hall at Louse Point</i>, is (wrongly) dismissed as erratic and
    avant-weak, even as it showcases her most striking vocals-- at turns chilled and self-absorbed, shriekingly
    gruesome, or tortured by rapture.  And <i>Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea</i> won Britain's
    Mercury Music Prize, but even some diehards called it slick and easy; and post 9/11, <i>Stories</i> actually
    sounds creepy, whether for the references to helicopters over New York, the song ""Kamikaze"", or that duet
    with Thom Yorke, which is hairlessly erotic like newts 69'ing.</p><p>
    
    Now, four years later, <i>Uh Huh Her</i>-- with its guttural title, punk-ugly cover and its advertised
    guitar-focus-- is billed as a ""return to form.""  But even if guitars dominate <i>Uh Huh Her</i>, the album
    ignores all expectations.  Harvey plays everything but drums, and you can recognize her rough and earthy
    tone on the electric, played like she's molding clay.  But even the buzzing distortion is focused and
    spare, mounted the way a collector hangs a precious Japanese sword.  It actually resembles Radiohead's
    <i>Hail to the Thief</i>, a guitar album that also succeeded because of its mood-- not because the mood
    saves the songs, but because the terse, simple writing makes the album so intimate.</p><p>
    
    The scenes of sexual tension and crisis here resemble those of <i>Is This Desire?</i>, but this time they
    don't require names or places. ""The Pocket Knife"" resembles a folk murder ballad, with a simple, perfect
    guitar part and lyrics like, ""Please don't make my wedding dress/ I'm too young to marry yet/ Can you see
    my pocket knife?/ You can't make me be a wife.""  Harvey murmurs ""The Desperate Kingdom of Love"" over a
    gentle acoustic, and the delicate imagery enhances a straight-up love ballad; and if the final song, ""The
    Darker Days of Me and Him"", promises recovery after a bad break-up (""I'll pick up the pieces/ I'll carry
    on somehow"") the tone stays grim, and Harvey's not patting herself on the back for knowing better.</p><p>
    
    Yet as careful as the atmosphere sounds, Harvey's ready to tear it apart at any time.  ""Cat on a Wall""
    actually sounds murky and misplaced, but ""The Letter"", the album's first single, builds in sharp bursts
    and terse riffs under the shrewd sexual imagery: ""Take the cap/ Off your pen/ Wet the envelope/ Lick and
    lick it.""  And the two-minute tantrum of ""Who the Fuck?"" devolves into the caveman-talk promised by the
    album title-- for example, the bridge: ""Who/ Who/ Who/ Who/ Fuck/ Fuck/ Fuck/ You.""  Britain's <i>Guardian</i>
    newspaper cites this as proof that Harvey's a ""certified lunatic,"" probably because they don't get the
    concept of ""catharsis.""</p><p>
    
    By the time you hear the accordion-and-guitar interlude, or the full minute of seagull calls, it's clear
    that Harvey isn't making a ""rock"" record per se.  And maybe to preserve the mood, Harvey doesn't give us
    her most striking material.  Outside of a few tracks like ""The Letter"", ""Pocket Knife"" or ""The Desperate
    Kingdom of Love"", the album is stronger than the sum of its interludes.  But if you take it as a whole,
    <i>Uh Huh Her</i> is deeply engrossing: Harvey has never explored the minimal-verging-on-primitive side
    of her music so thoroughly, or captured so exactly the sound of a mood swing.</p><p>
    
    And once again, unlike many of her peers and fellow 90s veterans, she refuses to categorize herself.  Her
    recorded work shows her not as a diva singer, or a rock goddess-- no matter how much her fans, or the
    world, want that-- but as an artist, who will seize the world or retreat from it completely if it serves
    her ends.  Harvey has never recorded a weak record, or even a transitional album; nothing set the audience
    up for this disc, and we may wait another four years until she's satisfied with the next one.  And that
    one probably won't sound like <i>Dry</i>, either.</p></div>"|3759.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3759-uh-huh-her/|7.6|Chris Dahlen

    so we know how much he likes repetition.  When he swims down to explore the depths of funk as Soul Center,
    he is often content to stand back and admire his perfect eight-bar rhythmic construction for minutes at
    a time.  And why not?  The dude is <em>good at it</em>.  As a philosophically minded German with a bedrock
    faith in Detroit techno, Brinkmann sees the sequencer as a holy thing, and he has an unusual knack for
    distilling humanity from endlessly repeating blips and beeps.</p><p>
<i>Tokyo + 1</i> is an audio travel diary of sorts, compiled from sounds Brinkmann recorded in Tokyo (with
    one track, the ""+1"", consisting of material recorded in the Greek city Ikaria).  True to Brinkmann's nature,
    this is no drifting album of field recordings.  Interludes of captured sound are there, but Brinkmann generally
    organizes his sources into tight coils of driving rhythm.  On the surface of ""109 Competition"", for instance,
    chaos reigns, as clipped syllables and metallic clanks appear and vanish with no discernable pattern.  But
    then, underneath, a steady pulse of noises have assembled themselves into something resembling house.</p><p>
    
    The shuffle of ""Mit Sugar"" is more difficult to source.  One moment it sounds like something a drum corps
    might march to, but then insertions of up-stroke synths morph the track into upbeat dub until unpredictable
    ""slips"" of the beat pull the listener out of a trance.  Throughout <i>Tokyo + 1</i>, Brinkmann playfully
    varies the dance styles with which he organizes his sounds.  ""3 St. 2 Shinjuku"" is hard techno, with
    relentlessly repetitive synth stabs, but the snippets of voice Brinkmann uses as a lead are soft and warm,
    providing balance and contrast.  The harsh and unforgiving bang of ""Lovesong"", which explores the filthy
    corner where industrial meets techno, provides no such padding.</p><p>
    
    Even when not shaping his files into danceable grooves, Brinkmann still lets the rhythm dictate.  ""Decoupe""
    consists mostly of chopped and processed bits of dialog, mostly in French, but a deeply buried synth drone
    and clicky beat ratchet up the tension.  It feels like it could explode into violence at any moment, as the
    static grows noisier and more fucked up with each loop.  ""Mamas"" is cruder in construction, as a series of
    voices and machine noises rush past like a film clip on the wrong speed fluttering uncontrollably.  The
    closing ""Ikaria"" doubles up and loops fragments of speech, bringing to mind the early tape work of Steve
    Reich.</p><p>
<i>Tokyo + 1</i> is not an easy listen but it packs a surprising amount of power considering how familiar
    this approach has become.  Field recordings, loops, crashing dishes transformed into a drum kit-- we've
    heard it all before.  But creative hands, whether bent over an old slab of vinyl with a pocketknife or
    guiding an optical mouse across a tabletop, have a way of making old things new.</p></div>"|1110.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1110-tokyo-1/|7.1|Mark Richardson

<p>One of the most intelligently transgressive agitprop noise troupes ever to decimate homemade synthesizers and     mundane rock 'n' roll tropes, Throbbing Gristle's distinct factory-fuck sounds are as abrasively fresh today     as when the quartet initiated its mission in 1975.  Discontent with ho-hum frameworks and facile reactionary     accouterments, Throbbing Gristle set out to subvert standard musical performance, and in the process, lived     up to their infamous parliamentary epithet of ""wreckers of civilization.""  In the booklet accompanying the     2002 reissue of the band's 1976-1980 live opus <i>TG24</i>, a 24xCD box set reissuing 1979's <i>24 Hours</i> (originally available on cassette only), Genesis P-Orridge states that where punk sought ""to change the     nature of rock 'n' roll,"" he and his cohorts were all about mutating and re-inscribing the very nature of     music itself.</p>
<p>Whether or not they succeeded is the stuff of music-geek webboards, but either way, Throbbing Gristle possess     one of rock history's more intriguing back stories.  In 1969, P-Orridge and then partner Cosey Fanni Tutti     formed the confrontational performance crew Coum Transmissions, inspired by the similar, earlier troupes     Fluxus and Happenings.  Graphic designer Peter Christopherson saw the duo's <i>Couming of Age</i> exhibition     at South London's Oval House Theatre in 1974 and asked if he could document the event with some photos.  A     kindred spirit, he was quickly nicknamed ""Sleazy"" by his Coum compatriots and joined the group the following     year for their <i>Couming of Youth</i> performance in Amsterdam.  The final TG catalyst was Waveforms     mastermind Chris Carter, a techie who built his own synthesizers and keyboards.  He attended one of the     band's jam sessions, and then signed on.</p>
<p><i>Prostitution</i>, a Coum exhibition at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts in October 1976, officially     brought them into the general consciousness.  This Coum retrospective consisted of nude photos of Fanni Tutti     and objects from Coum performances (used tampons and the like).  These materials, coupled with a set by     L.S.D. (later Generation X) and Throbbing Gristle's first official (and very bloody) set, caused outrage     in Parliament and amongst the general populous.</p>
<p>A full-fledged musical juggernaut, Throbbing Gristle went on to start its own label, Industrial Records, in     1977.  Using the slogan, ""Industrial Music for Industrial People,"" they released recordings by themselves,     William S. Burroughs, Cabaret Voltaire, Clock DVA, The Leather Nun, and others.  Reveling in Burroughs'     work (especially his cut-ups with Brion Gysin), as well as pornography, Aleister Crowley, and the Marquis     de Sade, the band itself was suitably named after the Hull slang term for an erection.  After their final     appearance in 1981-- part of a two-date California tour-- they notified fans and friends of their breakup     via postcards that read, ""The Mission Is Terminated.""  After the dissolution, the central cast of characters--     Chris Carter, Genesis P-Orridge, Cosey Fanni Tutti, and Peter ""Sleazy"" Christopherson-- tried to make good     on their numerous manifestos and claims, spawning Psychic TV, Chris &amp; Cosey (aka Carter Tutti), and Coil,     and partaking in careers in art, writing, and video/sound production.  The bifurcations are endless.</p>
<p>It's important to see Throbbing Gristle as a supreme non-band, a group of individuals who thought fashion     the enemy: Whereas Marilyn Manson gave himself digitized breasts for the cover of <i>Mechanical Animals</i>,     P-Orridge had a pair (to match his girlfriend's) implanted for real; pop divas play with the idea of     sexuality, whereas Fanni Tutti was a bona fide porn model and actress, partaking in 1975's <i>Teenage Sin</i> and 1970's 22-minute reel, <i>Sexangle</i>, among others.</p>
<p>As relevant (and forward thinking) as ever, Throbbing Gristle have now released two new collections of     material.  The stronger of the two, <i>The Taste of TG: A Beginner's Guide to the Music of Throbbing     Gristle</i>, offers 14 tracks culled from the band's four proper albums, two live tracks, and ""Exotic     Functions"" from <i>Journey Through a Body</i>, the group's last studio recording from March 1981.  Packaged     with a disturbing, tongue-lashing cover image by Sleazy, there happily isn't much overlap with 1984's     <i>Greatest Hits</i>-- only the absolutely essential ""Hamburger Lady"", ""Hot on the Heels of Love"", and     ""United"" are repeated-- and while neither replaces the original full-lengths, these Cliff's Notes are     as good a launching point as any.</p>
<p><i>The Taste of TG</i> opens with the ascension of hazy washes on 1977's ""Industrial Introduction"" and     shifts imperceptibly to the poltergeist bells, trilling synth, and discotheque percussion of ""Distant     Dreams - Part 2"" from 1981's <i>Mission of Dead Souls</i>, and later includes the solid tribal rocker     ""Something Came Over Me"", which, along with The Dickies' ""If Stuart Could Talk"" and The Buzzcocks' ""Orgasm     Addict"", ranks among the catchiest punk-ass songs about jerking off ever committed to tape.  As P-Orridge     enthuses: ""Something came over me/ Was it white and sticky?/ I don't know what it was/ My daddy didn't like     it/ But I do it anyway/ Well, I rather liked it.""  ""Hot on the Heels of Love"", from 1979's essential <i>20     Jazz Funk Greats</i>, retains its compulsory techno danceability with chronic electro percussion, spare     synth, and Cosey Fanni Tutti's breathy, ""I'm hot on the heels of love/ Waiting for help from above.""</p>
<p>Other tracks are less rhythm-oriented.  You can hear Wolf Eyes in the humid, monkey-cage kabuki of     ""Exotic Functions"" and the tortured insect monsoon of ""Cabaret Voltaire"", the latter of which is represented     here by a 1978 live rendition captured at Wakefield's Industrial Training College.  The submerged,     incomprehensible grunge frolic of ""Zyklon B. Zombie"" still disturbs: Over distorted electronics, a warped,     somehow bubbly vocal intones: ""I'm just a little Jewish girl/ Ain't got no clothes on/ And if I had a steel     hammer/ I'd smash your teeth in/ And as I walk her to the gas chamber/ I'm out there laughing.""  Elsewhere,     the agonizing bare-bones scream-core of ""We Hate You (Little Girls)"" serves as an utterly tweaked foil.</p>
<p><i>Mutant TG</i>, which contains eight remixes-- some by members of the band itself, and some by visionary     electronic artists such as Carl Craig and Two Lone Swordsmen-- is a less powerful representation of     Throbbing Gristle's work, due to some ponderousness and one too many cooks.  Though a few of its pieces     are interesting, Throbbing Gristle's originals are far trashier, ambient, intuitive, and less easily     categorized.  The edges seemed more porous and dense on the original versions, suggesting a sexier, far     creepier dancefloor.  Here, the French/U.S. collaborative duo Motor offer a nicely disemboweled ""Persuasion"",     while Carl Craig wisely keeps intrusions to a minimum on his revamps of ""Hot on the Heels of Love"" and     ""Still Walking"".  Otherwise, Hedonastik turns ""What a Day"" into PBS-styled world techno, Two Lone Swordsman     shift ""United""'s spooky Crowley to maudlin Trent Reznor, and Basement Jaxx's Simon Ratcliffe turns a deaf     ear to ""Hot on the Heels of Love"", plowing subtleties with overloaded dancefloor trope, sonic breakdowns     and an embarrassingly ""explosive"" finale.</p>
<p>Proving they know how to best plug their own gaps with intricacies, Chris Carter and Cosey Fanni Tutti ably     rework ""Hamburger Lady"".  Their update maintains the original's spooky locust feel, but slows things down     ever more and splices in additional dub etchings.  The duo also create a ""United"" and ""Hot on the Heels of     Love"" hybrid titled ""Hotheelsunited"".  The new percussion, insistent pulse swells, precipitate line-breaks,     rich gradations, and overall shadowing allow ""Hotheelsunited"" to end <i>Mutant TG</i> on an official bang.     Even so, it goes without saying that this is a fans-only release.</p>
<p>On these two collections, Throbbing Gristle not only sound current, but are current.  In fact, they're     still active today.  Although their one-off reunion show planned for a couple of weeks ago was unfortunately     cancelled, they do plan to rattle through their last-ever concert at self-curated event in April 2005.  The     unexpected delay has certainly bummed-out a bunch of longtime diehards, but at least newer fans now have     close to a year to unpack the quartet's vast output before deciding if they'll partake in the last hurrah.     That was advance warning, so arm yourself.</p></div>"|11849.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11849-the-taste-of-tg-a-beginners-guide-to-the-music-of-throbbing-gristle-mutant-tg/|7.9|Brandon Stosuy

That said,
    I take no shame in branding Maritime dainty, callow guitar pop for snuggly teenagers; that's the context in
    which I enjoyed lead singer Davey von Bohlen's work with The Promise Ring, even the lamentable <i>Very
    Emergency</i>.  But if there's one thing I've learned from reviewing music, it's to take nothing for
    granted.  In that respect, Maritime, the collaboration between von Bohlen, former Dismemberment Plan bassist
    Eric Axelson, and Promise Ring timekeeper Dan Didier is as legit a candidate as any for my approbation.  In
    fact, I really wanted to like it, despite the bounty of reasons to suspect dreck.  Perhaps, I thought,
    von Bohlen, in cahoots with the virtuosic Axelson, might have regained the edge he'd lost during his
    latter period with The Promise Ring, or finally stylized his affinity for bland power pop.</p><p>
    
    If only.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, Maritime doesn't vindicate my wishful thinking.  If there's any difference between this
    album and von Bohlen's lackluster recent output, it's that this collection somehow manages to be even
    more tepid.  However, the album does make a tempting come-on in its opening two tracks.  ""The Window Is
    the Door"" reshapes Chris Carrabba's acousticized love balladry into something more genuine and infinitely
    less vomit-inducing, probably for von Bohlen's reluctance (or inability) to belt his mundane verses with
    an ardor disproportionate to their profundity.  ""Sleep Around"" is a sleek exercise in nouveau piano pop,
    handling a potentially disastrous array of strings and horns with unexpected finesse.  Featuring some of
    <i>Glass Floor</i>'s strongest melodies and a fluid lyrical narrative, the song suffers only from von
    Bohlen's unashamedly lacking vocal cords.</p><p>
    
    By now, it's no secret: The man can't sing.  Often enough in the past, von Bohlen's songwriting has outshone
    his prominent vocal ineptitude; it's when he attempts to make his tunelessness endearing that his songs
    become unbearable, and unfortunately, this is the case with most of <i>Glass Floor</i>.</p><p>
    
    There was a time, back in The Promise Ring's heyday, when great tracks like ""Is This Thing On?"" and ""Why
    Did We Ever Meet?"" were the standard, not mere anomalies.  However, since 1999, von Bohlen has fixated on
    feeble contemporary pop, resulting in a string of effete, unduly flaccid albums whose occasionally winsome
    melodies have been asphyxiated by flat production and unenergetic performance.  Here, tracks like the
    soporific lullaby ""A Night Like This"" are the norm, and as such, the album is an arduous slog.  Pining
    love songs are notoriously difficult to execute, but one way to generate at least some intrigue is to avoid
    writing songs that actually sound like they're about pining love.  A contrast between form and content can
    be helpful when dealing with particularly trite subject matter, and that doesn't apply exclusively to
    feckless lyricists like von Bohlen.</p><p>
    
    But perhaps the real disappointment of <i>Glass Floor</i> is that it tarnishes Eric Axelson's previously
    flawless reputation.  After playing a starring role in The Dismemberment Plan, where his dexterous playing
    and effortless meter manipulation often buoyed the band's corybantic compositions, here, he's sadly
    mollified.  Only on the closing track ""Human Beings"" is one of his lines even remotely distinguishable
    from von Bohlen's rhythmically staid guitar parts, and unsurprisingly, it makes for one of the record's
    few interesting moments.</p><p>
    
    Most albums are at least somewhat frontloaded, but when a record sports only two truly strong numbers, it's
    hard even to describe it as such.  ""The Window Is the Door"" and ""Sleep Around"" are by far this album's
    highlights, not because they're exceedingly better than the rest of the material, but because Maritime's
    style of lukewarm guitar pop is so tedious by comparison.  By song three, <i>Glass Floor</i> has already
    waned past its endurable limit, with nearly a dozen indolent tracks to go, and von Bohlen's cloying strains
    make it difficult even to use the disc as innocuous background music.  There are far more appetizing things
    to stick in one's discman than <i>Glass Floor</i>, and I don't mean strictly CDs.</p></div>"|5590.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5590-glass-floor/|3.2|Sam Ubl

    and shredded cheddar, Tahiti 80's creamy, dreamy delicacies are manufactured for easy export.  Xavier Boyer
    and his gang of merry Parisians embody that quintessentially Gallic combination of élan and ennui, vigor
    and boredom-- those seemingly antithetical traits the French can so easily capture with the slightest
    Gauloises-punctuated gesture or well-placed Camus quotation.  With <i>A Piece of Sunshine</i>, Tahiti 80
    masterfully temper their continental contradictions with tender melodrama and songs sung in surprisingly
    facile English, turning out a sophisticated, trans-Atlantic paean in the universal language of pop.</p><p>
    Their third outing on Chicago's Francophilic imprint Minty Fresh finds Tahiti 80 at their most succinct and
    confident.  Here, they've trimmed the psychedelic pomp from last year's <i>Wallpaper for the Soul</i> to
    reveal a radiant core of impeccable songwriting and elevated arrangements.  Even in its gel-capped
    accessibility, the album remains complex and absorbing, a gorgeous, multifaceted jewel of acid-washed
    guitars, glittery horn flourishes, and frayed electronic texture.</p><p>
    While Tahiti 80 are certainly beholden to the great bubblegum symphony conductors like Brian Wilson and
    Van Dyke Parks, their streamlined packaging and electronic frills also resemble FM radio champs like The
    Cardigans and The Beautiful South.  The whistled melody that bisects ""Listen""'s jangled guitar and sweeping
    Mellotron matches the sober theme of Boyer's lyrics: ""It's easy to think you are special/ Simple to find
    out after all/ You're just like anybody else/ That's all.""  The brooding ""Aftermath"" hints at anxious
    foreboding, its minor-key pedal steel and glitchy, space-rock effects hinting at some looming depression
    the song's gilded chorus keeps at bay, while the folk-funk of ""Don't Misunderstand"" segues from gentle
    acoustic strumming into a lush electronic crunch, a duality that's presented effortlessly and effectively.</p><p>
    In a culture where all art is high art-- from <i>Herbie the Love Bug</i> and Jerry Lewis to Manu Chao and
    Daft Punk-- where Serge Gainsbourg's biggest multi-platinum hit was straightfacedly titled (translated from
    the idiomatic, idiosyncratic French) ""I Love You... Me Neither"", turning seemingly standard radio-friendly
    histrionics into pop perfection comes rather easily.  To wit: <i>Sunshine</i>'s peak moment, the inexplicably
    titled ""Antonelli.""  At precisely three minutes, five seconds of undeniable glory, the song rises halfway
    through this underlong album and stands out like a monument.  ""Antonelli"" features Tahiti 80's brilliantly
    precise blending of diffuse pop elements: grandiose horn parts, grinding electronic bass, sonorous drums,
    echoing guitar, all wrapped up in shimmering, airtight production.  It's a soaring, fully realized
    instrumental pop anthem that wouldn't be out of place standing next to Stereolab at their most ambitious
    or The Flaming Lips at their most sober.</p><p>
    When the album finally closes with ""In My Arms"", a bittersweet acoustic ballad, we're ready for a comedown.
    Even at a mere 25 minutes long (barely qualifying it as an EP in some circles) <i>A Piece of Sunshine</i>
    manages to pack in a stunning amount of music.  Tahiti 80 cuts off more than just a piece; they lay out
    the whole damn sunshiney pie on the table and dole out more than enough to share.</p></div>"|8259.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8259-a-piece-of-sunshine/|7.3|Jonathan Zwickel

    their music, but <a href=""http://www.thecaribbeanisaband.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><u>The Caribbean's remarkably professional
    online domain</u></a> is such a resoundingly brilliant sendup of a bland, mission statement-touting
    corporate website (replete with two generic employees mugging in the header and loads of meaningless
    business nothingspeak) that I initially thought I had the wrong URL.  Given that I spend all week breathing
    a Fortune 500 company's recirculated air and cynically deconstructing the grammar and vocabulary of memos
    explaining to me why giving me less money is good for the company, I found this all quite hilarious.  This
    kind of satire only works if you do it to the hilt, honing the vocabulary and patterning the entire site
    after the same concept, and to their credit, The Caribbean haven't missed a single detail.</p><p>
    
    And fortunately, The Caribbean are just as detail-oriented in their music.  They've even brought some of
    their website into their packaging for this, their second EP, styling the recording credits after a W2
    form.  The sense of space between the airtight drums and the colder, more open sound of the remaining
    instruments is immense, and it frames their occasionally obtuse lyrics in a weird, urban texture that
    nicely echoes the slideshow of outdoor urban photographs by cover artist Sara Padgett included on the
    disc.  Of course, you could always argue that couplets like, ""The only way the teletype gets out is by
    the bounty of my merciful soul/ I'm the one who has the code,"" make a lot more sense than the average
    corporate memo.</p><p>
    
    Actually, Michael Kentoff's lyrics have grown significantly more focused since his stint in the mid-90s
    with D.C.'s Townies, and he delivers a couple of great narratives on <i>William of Orange</i>, the best
    being ""The Druggist's"", a tale of summer job ennui.  Kentoff's Gibbardish tenor is doubled by a piano as
    he lays out a scenario in which he obtains his driver's license, and a job to go with it.  The way he
    describes a 16-year-old's real (if petty) concerns is fantastically inventive, despite its very simplicity:
    ""Delivering prescriptions posed a special problem with the manual transmission/ The druggist's car, a
    Rabbit, smelled like oil and coffee/ Had no radio or tape deck/ Begged my mom to let me drive our Chevy
    wagon.""</p><p>
    
    The opening title track sets the mood nicely with Tony Dennison, late of Smart Went Crazy, laying down a
    busy yet relaxed drum part which the band coats in carefully placed electronic textures and rich,
    room-temperature acoustic guitars.  Death Cab for Cutie and The Postal Service are apt comparison points,
    especially now that Kentoff has developed his knack for evocative imagery and inexact rhyme.  The Caribbean
    do much to move themselves to the forefront of pop fit for late-night headphone sessions in wood-paneled
    dens on <i>William of Orange</i>, and if they can stretch this consistency over their next album, we have
    much to look forward to.</p></div>"|1309.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1309-william-of-orange-ep/|7.4|Joe Tangari

    graveyard, reads: ""Now we rise and we are everywhere.""  The words were penned by Drake in 1974; 30 years
    later, they seem jarringly prophetic.</p><p>
    
    Like nearly all prematurely buried cult figures, Nick Drake is reinvented each time he is rediscovered.
    In 2000, the sheepish, astral musings of ""Pink Moon"" became synonymous with backing a Cabrio convertible
    out of a house party, sparking an unlikely boost in record sales and propelling <i>Pink Moon</i> towards
    platinum status nearly 26 years after Drake's death.  But with each well-intentioned revival of interest,
    Nick Drake slips further and further out of reach, hopelessly martyred and codified, superceded and
    consumed by his own tragic context.  Nick Drake has become: the 26-year-old prophet, the diffident enigma,
    the tortured precursor to Kurt Cobain, the fallen hero, the folksinger-as-folksymbol, the self-sacrificing
    patron saint of lonely, disaffected teenagers-- the One who died for our sins.</p><p>
    
    Even now, being indoctrinated into the cult of Drake is stupidly easy.  Line the unbearably poetic
    circumstances of Drake's death (swallowing a fatal handful of anti-depressants, either deliberately or
    by accident) against the soft melancholy of his tiny canon, and witness a very specific kind of bedroom
    deity being birthed: Drake's three proper studio records form a bulletproof triumvirate, synergizing to
    create an impossibly satisfying (and telling) arc, riddled with prescient pull-quotes and expectedly
    dynamic emotions.  Given the irrefutable magnificence of what he left behind, it's always seemed perfectly
    logical to assume that every single thing Nick Drake ever did should be worth piles of attention.  And
    really, who wants to know if it's not?</p><p>
    
    Thus, it's only appropriate to approach each new Drake compilation with a bit of honest trepidation, and
    to be anxious about the sullying of an otherwise pristine recording career.  Nick Drake wrote, recorded,
    and released three records between 1968 and his mysterious death in 1974, but the subsequent permutation
    of capitalistic yearning and superfan desperation saw Drake's discography significantly (and mercilessly)
    puffed up by a handful of dubious posthumous releases.  Some of these efforts have been worthwhile (the
    excellent <i>Time of No Reply</i>, which rounded out the first reissue of the <i>Fruit Tree</i> box, and
    <i>Heaven Is a Wildflower</i>, both released in 1986), some renegade (the widely distributed <i>Tanworth-in-Arden
    Home Recordings</i> and <i>Second Grace</i>) and some completely superfluous (1994's sloppy <i>Way to Blue</i>,
    which unapologetically regurgitates, unchanged, ten of <i>Heaven Is a Wildflower</i>'s fourteen tracks).
    In 1994, Drake's pioneering producer, Joe Boyd, promised <i>Mojo</i>: ""Everything releasable has been
    released.""</p><p>
    
    Compiled by engineer John Wood and former roommate Robert Kirby, <i>Made to Love Magic</i> is a footnote, a
    hiccup, a voyeuristic peepshow.  It is not a revelation.  Completists will revel in the resuscitation of
    rare/unheard tracks, including two Cambridge-era dorm demos (""Mayfair"", ""River Man""), outtakes from the
    <i>Five Leaves Left</i> sessions (""Joey"", ""Clothes of Sand""), remastered stereo versions of the mono mixes
    that appeared on <i>Time of No Reply</i> (""Rider on the Wheel"", ""Black-Eyed Dog"", ""Hanging on a Star""),
    two tracks with strings re-orchestrated and re-recorded by Kirby (""I Was Made to Love Magic"", ""Time of No
    Reply""), an early rendition of ""Three Hours"" (with Drake backed by an anonymous flautist and percussionist
    Rebop Kwaku Baah, later of Can and Traffic), and even causal fans will be anxious to hear the recently
    discovered Drake original, ""Tow the Line.""  Recorded just four months before Drake's death, ""Tow the Line""
    has been loudly touted as the last song Drake ever committed to tape, and his pale, listless vocals do
    little to detract from the artist-on-the-edge theatrics so implicit in that tag-- the song would fit neatly
    on <i>Pink Moon</i>, its frail lyrics and stark strums easily maintaining the fatalistic mood of Drake's
    final record.</p><p>
    
    ""Tow the Line"" may be <i>Made to Love Magic</i>'s big selling point, but it's hardly the only attraction:
    Robert Kirby's sprawling new string arrangement on the title track, while conceptually awkward (and vaguely
    disingenuous), proves a marked improvement over the maudlin squealings available on previous versions.
    Still, Kirby can do little to stop ""I Was Made to Love Magic"" from sounding like a ridiculous, fawning
    homage to Walt Disney, all maudlin, unconvincing swoons and gooey swells, with Drake goofily crooning
    the song's title.</p><p>
    
    Despite the best intentions of its creators, <i>Made to Love Magic</i> feels disjointed and weird, and even
    the most mundane of improvements somehow still seem contrived-- the new, stereo mix of ""Black Eyed Dog""
    shatters the stark precariousness of the original, wherein Drake, barely singing, howled blankly: ""I'm
    growing old/ And I don't wanna know/ I'm growing old/ And I wanna go home.""  Bolstered by a thick and
    ominous slathering of tape hiss, the bootleg version of ""Black Eyed Dog"" violently suggested, however
    inadvertently, that Drake might not make it all the way through the song-- and that tension only ever
    added to its morose appeal.  In some ways, <i>Made to Love Magic</i> nobly attempts to strip Drake of
    his signifiers, and to cut him loose from his cross.  But broadcasting Drake's comparably mediocre drippings
    won't alter his deification, at least not significantly.  All it really does is muddy up the water a bit.</p></div>"|2445.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2445-made-to-love-magic/|6.7|Amanda Petrusich

The old world mustiness that
    permeates this record brushes your ears like armpit hair.  The monomaniacal beats and shrieking vocals may
    sound familiar to fans of no wave and post-punk, but this Montreal band coats them with a distinguished
    patina; the fog rolls in as a man croons a French ballad, and the scratchy vinyl that colors the first
    track stays in your mind through the end.  It's as noisy as any example of the genre, but instead of shrill,
    it's stubbornly ugly.</p><p>
    
    This album has kicked around from reissue to reissue for a couple of years, and as Alien8 Recordings puts
    out the latest copy, Les Georges Leningrad may have already outgrown it.  The other bands that revived the
    monomaniacal beats and shrieking vocals of no wave-- Liars, for example-- have moved on since 2002 to more
    individual statements, or at least to digging up other graves.  And while the lo-fi recording helps the
    ambience, <i>Deux Hot Dogs Moutarde Chou</i> is like listening into a party through two tin cans and some
    string; by contrast, the costumes and cabaret acts you see in their concert photos make them look sensational,
    like a Cirque de Soleil with no underwear.</p><p>
    
    At this point, the two frontwomen may be the least impressive part of the band.  If you strain to listen,
    you can appreciate all the gnarls and extremes in their vocals.  But the lyrics, when they aren't actually
    swallowed in the noise, are pro forma-- who needs another jibe at women who wear Gucci and Chanel?-- and
    even this much noise needs personality.  Why hint at sex when you could wallow in decadence?  And why let
    off some shrieks when you could be totally excruciating?</p><p>
    
    But <i>Deux Hot Dogs Moutarde Chou</i> boasts several strong tracks, from the clomping beat of ""Lollipop
    Lady"" and the pogo-friendly ""Didi Extra"", to the herniated melody of ""Georges V"", which showcases their
    strained, bird-throated vocals.  And while they mostly stick to fast dance tracks, the band grinds itself
    together like sausage on the slow-burner ""Cocktail Vampire"".  They expand their noise palette with farfisas
    and farting reeds, and the album's best solo-- on ""Georges V""-- is just the sound of someone spinning a
    radio dial; but all of that's carried by persistent rhythms and a guitarist who crunches out riffs as if
    he's slapping someone detestable.</p><p>
    
    As much as the band tries to annoy and antagonize, the seedy interludes set it apart from a crowd.  <i>Deux
    Hot Dogs Moutarde Chou</i> will satisfy, and maybe even impress, anyone who likes this kind of music.  But
    it'll be interesting to see if they go any farther on their next album; by now, they might know how to
    capture the personality that this disc barely reveals.</p></div>"|4962.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4962-deux-hot-dogs-moutarde-chou/|7.4|Chris Dahlen

    wars, social upheaval, crippling poverty, not to mention the everyday trials of romantic fallout and family
    illness.  But rather than inspiring Springsteen-ian story songs, these predicaments add a darkly existential
    drama and gravity to <i>Customs</i>, Phelps' fourth full-length with drummer William Herzog and bassist
    Robert Mercer as The Downer Trio.</p><p>
    
    Thematically, the songs on <i>Customs</i> are all linked by Phelps' quest for salvation through portraying
    his characters' plights: Everyone wants to be saved.  The album begins with the steel drum-inflected ""From
    Up Here"", one of several songs that address the sacrifices of war and the friction between honor and horror:
    ""When the night is over and I'm in the light,"" Phelps sings, ""remember me to no one says I wouldn't fight.""
    ""Kelly Grand Forks"", perhaps the most hopeful track on the album, depicts romantic disappointment with a
    steely eye, and ""Mother I'm Waiting"" hovers bedside while a parent dies: ""Mother, I am waiting for you to
    be whole/ You don't know who I am/ But you know who I am.""</p><p>
    
    If Phelps' lyrics are occasionally cryptic or so humorless as to make the songs feel airtight, he compensates
    with the generous scope of his mission: The redemption he seeks is rarely solely personal, and is sometimes
    large enough to encompass a family or a community.  In the Seattle-set ""Lie for the Day"", for example, he
    assails the hollow promise of dot-com prosperity, which enriched the region's coffers but not its soul:
    ""All of us staring down the Green River"" ask to be kept ""safe from the darkness below.""</p><p>
    
    What enervates this quest and saves it from being merely academic is the music.  Like Phelps' previous
    full-length, 1999's <i>Blackbird</i>, <i>Customs</i> has a grinding sound that pulls from his grunge roots
    in Silkworm as well as from a particular brand of roots rock, which, on songs like ""Be First!"" and ""Kelly
    Grand Forks"", recalls the Midwestern muddiness of Uncle Tupelo.  Like a blaring live show, the album is
    simultaneously intimate and off-putting, as it constantly demands and disrupts listeners' attention.
    Occasionally, however, it's a little bit too sludgy and overwrought, and the Trio indulge some ideas that
    probably worked well live but don't translate to the stereo.  Most egregiously, ""Shame"" culminates in more
    than two minutes of false endings, which grow increasingly tedious with each chord.</p><p>
    
    But the most powerful instrument on <i>Customs</i> is Phelps' voice, which seems to hold deep reserves of
    emotions.  When he strains for high notes, his voice blares almost unmusically, revealing a vulnerability
    behind the thick guitar sound.  On songs like ""Be First!"" and the third verse of ""Kelly Grand Forks"", his
    voice seems to detach from the music and rumble on its own.  Fortunately, Herzog and Mercer don't even
    flinch at these vocal crescendos, but remain steady and imperturbable throughout <i>Customs</i>, like
    two friends helping a drunk stumble home.</p><p>
    
    There's something intriguingly self-critical in Phelps' vocals: His straining signals his frustrations not
    only with the futility of the dismal dilemmas he describes, but also with the limits of music to convey
    such emotional extremes.  He constantly searches but never discovers a thematic push-and-pull between the
    words and the notes, which turns the album's stark weaknesses into compelling strengths.  It is through
    such sins that he comes closest to redemption-- but, thankfully, never close enough.</p></div>"|6264.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6264-customs/|7.9|Stephen M. Deusner

    Mclusky were louder, ruder and tighter, and they took more drugs.  I imagine there are bands out there who've
    been trying for nearly two years to build themselves back up after <i>Mclusky Do Dallas</i> tarnished their
    egos by calling them names and wiping its muddy feet on their sofas.  ""To Hell with Good Intentions"" stung
    (""My band is better than your band/ We've got more songs than a song convention""), but ""Collagen Rock"" was
    just plain uncalled for (""It's easy to say now their trainers seemed fine/ And their hair was a fucking
    delight/ But one of those bands got paid, I heard/ One of those bands got fake tits"").</p><p>
    
    Yet while Andy Falkous' acidic repartees were enough to take the confidence out of any group trying to make
    a name for themselves, scores of fans found perverse pleasure in the record's bloody tussle.  In light of
    that album's success, Mclusky's third long-player, <i>The Difference Between Me and You Is That I'm not on
    Fire</i>, is difficult to talk about without alluding to <i>Do Dallas</i>' monster-truck riffage and
    spaz-out lyrical missives.</p><p>
<i>The Difference Between Me and You</i> takes a rougher-hewn approach to expanding upon <i>Do Dallas</i>'
    different extremes, yet seems to share more attributes with Mclusky's 2000 debut, <i>My Pain and Sadness Is
    More Painful Than Yours</i>.  Aside from each having titles involving terse personal comparisons, both
    records are malformed and underdeveloped, despite being similarly heavy on ideas.  Andy Falkous' lyrics
    haven't regressed in their wittiness or caustic sarcasm, but his delivery is seldom as balls-out as on
    <i>Do Dallas</i>' ""Lightsaber Cocksucking Blues"" or their pants-soiling 2003 single, ""There Ain't No Fool
    in Ferguson"".  Here, Mclusky appear to have recoiled from the hilarious absurdity of <i>Do Dallas</i>,
    and the move yields mixed results.</p><p>
    
    Interestingly, though, the record does find the band succeeding in some as-yet-unexplored territory.  ""She
    Will Only Bring You Happiness"", a serious contender for their best track to date, is unlike any of their
    previous material: more tender, more tuneful, and more conventionally pop-minded.  Following a brittle,
    strummed guitar, Falkous delivers an anthemic, self-reproaching vocal in markedly subdued form: ""Note to
    self/ Be erect by half-past-ten/ Be strong/ Be proud/ Be able/ Be charmed,"" he sings, and for once, his
    voice-- possessing each of those qualities in droves-- is accompanied not by the reverberating gristle
    that's colored nearly all previous performances, but by a soaring, wistful guitar melody and a remarkably
    casual, downtempo rhythm.  After exhausting a few verses, Falkous drops out, allowing the placid guitar
    line to shine, before chiming in again with the lyric, ""Our old singer is a sex criminal.""  He's soon
    buttressed by a triple-tracked echo to form a cascading harmony that, despite the lyric's poetic oddness,
    is this album's sterling moment.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, ""She Will Only Bring You Happiness"" isn't a single, and there a dozen other tracks to account
    for, none of which live up to that song's pop splendor, and few of which even come close.  One that does,
    albeit in sufficiently contrasting form, is the dubiously titled ""KKKitchens, What Were You Thinking?""
    Following ""She Will Only Bring You Happiness"", the track dispels any potential sea change in Mclusky's
    sound that may have been hinted at by the previous number.  Clocking in on the short side of two minutes,
    the song perhaps most closely reflects the bulk of <i>Do Dallas</i>' material, only tighter and more
    extreme in both volume and tempo.  ""Your Children Are Waiting for You to Die"" follows, attempting to
    reconcile the stylistic polar opposites of the preceding two tracks, and for the most part, works-- until
    an abrupt stop that stifles any momentum the band had built.</p><p>
    
    The ensuing handful of tracks is a slog.  In trying to accentuate the extremes of <i>Do Dallas</i>, Mclusky
    have found themselves with some throwaways on their hands.  ""Slay!"", in particular, is an ill fit: Opening
    with a brooding vamp, the song quickly fades to black, thanks to a clumsily handled volume knob, before
    re-emerging with an expected jolt.  In a live setting, the move might seem a pleasant surprise, but within
    the compressed dynamics of a studio album, it feels painfully stilted.  ""Support Systems"" features more
    shock-and-awe dynamics, but grows dirgeful in its slow-building eight minutes.  Throughout the record's
    entire sluggish second half, ""You Should Be Ashamed, Seamus"" stands out as the only truly solid track.
    Plodding, but anthemic, the song best affects the many promising ideas presented here, and retains intrigue
    on the strength of its central riff.  Also, unlike many of the numbers here, its ending doesn't seem forced
    or clipped, as at 3:45, the song performs a limpid tempo change that it rides to a grinding unison halt.</p><p>
<i>The Difference Between Me and You Is That I'm Not on Fire</i> is like a delicious soup you eagerly bring
    to your lips, only to jerk away because it's too damn hot.  It's impudent of Mclusky to serve their delectable
    concoctions like this; if only they showed more restraint, and dropped an ice cube in the scalding mix, the
    result would be more palatable.  Nevertheless, trying something new and coming up slightly short beats
    safely regurgitating proven ideas, and even if they didn't nail what they were aiming for on this outing,
    well, they're probably still better than your band.</p></div>"|5186.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5186-the-difference-between-me-and-you-is-that-im-not-on-fire/|7.2|Sam Ubl

    extra-wide historical scrolls next to similarly noteworthy weird/long titles, like <i>Lift Your Skinny
    Fists Like Antennas to Heaven</i>, or the positively novelistic <i>Lifted, or, The Story Is in the Soil,
    Keep Your Ear to the Ground</i>.  But the Lawrence, KS combo shares something musically with Bright Eyes
    and the similarly long-winded And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, in that their approach to pop
    meanders through some noisy, hilly, crazy wac funky terrain before finally divining its restless bliss.</p><p>
    
    Though they seem locked in constant struggle with the sonic desire for more, more, and still more, Minus
    Story are quite adept at keeping loping melody and lyrical wonderment-- with the world, romance, whatever--
    front and center.  Vocalist Jordan Geiger seems particularly capable in this area; he's of the Modest Mouse
    school, where singing in a fractured falsetto is taught alongside the crafting of cryptnotic simplistic
    couplets.  ""Heaven's a whore made of solid gold/ Her heart is a hole/ She'll never be full,"" he whinnies
    in ""Gravity Pulls"".  Then, as the song's shuffling, echoing drums and rustic acoustic guitar are joined by
    a xylophone and even more guitars, Geiger switches up the pronouns to refer to his own empty heart, and
    harmonized vocals and maxed levels begin rising and falling with the subsequently buoyant instrumental
    crests.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Won't Be Fooled Again"" shares this penchant for racket-building.  Beginning with a synthesized
    thumb piano, its title phrase becomes a harshly whispered mantra over roughly 3 million backwards-looped
    acoustic guitars.  Trumpets join the fray, too, before a Grandaddy-esque rhythm section arrives drunk and
    horny.  It's all quite dramatic, with an epic sway capable of turning the Neutral Milk Hotel into a chain
    of sprawling resorts.</p><p>
    
    Given its voracious appetite for building hoary walls of psychedelic noise to the gods of skinny jeans
    Valhalla, this <i>Captain</i>'s occasional threats to let go of the wheel aren't too surprising.  With
    its treated piano, ghostly music boxes, and squirting keyboard choral section, ""Open Your Eyes"" constantly
    threatens to wander off course, to find some loopy hippie girl who likes suspended orchestral movements
    and Eskimo kisses to settle down and fart with.  But it never does, and the rudder stays true.  ""Eyes""
    joins the eight-minute-plus ""You're My Air"" as one of the album's most powerfully melodic moments.  ""Air""
    also spends about half its duration hiding a prettily baroque melody in a cavernous staircase storage
    facility-- confused drums climb up and down the mothballed steps in search of focus, causing headaches and
    irritation for the feet.  But the clatter eventually subsides, the screwy tangents dovetail beautifully,
    and the swelling recedes for four final minutes of warm and surging bliss.</p><p>
    
    After all its lengthy detours, Minus Story really are making pop.  They seem to truly believe in a world
    of slow-motion confetti, where we'll all heed Geiger's desire to breath with him, inhale the amniotic fluid
    of ""You Were on My Side"", and float together into church organ abyss.  Like most abysses, the depths will
    have their share of spiny dead ends, and floating, bloated corpses, but any fear should have died with the
    Captain, so let the awkward indie tripping begin.</p></div>"|5587.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5587-the-captain-is-dead-let-the-drum-corpse-dance/|7.5|Johnny Loftus

I listen for seams,
    trying to determine where and how the pieces were stitched together, which simultaneously keeps me hovering
    over the surface of the music while taking occasional dips inside.  You can get to know something intimately
    when you're trying to figure out how it's done.</p><p>
    
    Anyone who's looked through a club calendar in San Francisco in the last ten years has seen Romanowski's
    name.  He's a Johnny-on-the-spot DJ and producer who's spun everywhere in town (I saw him perform at the
    45 Session where DJ Shadow first collaborated with Cut Chemist) and he moves easily between styles and
    formats.  On <i>Steady Rocking</i>, Romanowski indulges his love of rocksteady, the late-60s Jamaican
    form in which the 1/3 ska beat is slowed by half, thus creating a bridge to reggae proper.</p><p>
    
    Romanowski credits himself with writing and producing, but it's hard to say what exactly is happening on
    this unusual record.  On the one hand, it sounds really old, with tinny production choices and a certain
    air around the instruments that modern studios seem incapable of replicating.  You can hear an echo from
    ancient wood-paneled walls soaked in thick clouds of skunk.  If this is mere sonic emulation, Romanowski
    is a total genius, but I think it something else is happening.  Several tracks feature guest musicians
    on guitar, saxophone and flute, yet much of the record sounds sampled, like scratch guitar and drum fills
    were chopped apart and reassembled bit by bit.  It's possible that he's lifted chunks of songs from obscure
    rocksteady records, but I doubt it.  The various pieces fit too tightly together to have been stitched
    from long sections.  Wherever these sounds originated, they've been arranged into something new.</p><p>
    
    And then, oddly, the record sounds new.  Many of the drums obviously come from programmed machines, with
    beats that stiffen to the digital clock and reflect a hint of Romanowski's hip-hop roots.  And then the
    dub touches, when they appear (J Boogie, Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto, and Gadget all offer dub
    remixes, though the techniques crop up elsewhere), have a sophistication that stretches beyond Tubby's
    four-track.  ""Flat Picker"" is nothing more than a base of hip-hop beats with Jan Whitefield's impossibly
    supple guitar drawing curlicues in the vast open space, and it sounds like a more successful version of
    what Stefan Betke was trying to get at on the instrumental tracks of the last Pole record.</p><p>
    
    ""Why?"" adds
    newly recorded sax and flute lines that sound ancient and perfect, an early 70s version of breezy island
    party music, and adds assorted vocal samples that sound recent.  J Boogie's dub of ""Romjack Steady"" shows
    how dense and orchestral this music can get, as it ups the tempo and adds enough reverb to the horns to
    make the track sound huge.  The rhythms throughout are simultaneously relaxed and forceful.  <i>Steady
    Rocking</i> is contemporary production and collage methods meeting rocksteady somewhere in the exact
    middle, making for a seriously fresh-sounding record.</p></div>"|6912.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6912-steady-rocking/|7.1|Mark Richardson

    Nick Hornby writes of his affliction with contemporary music.  ""To me,"" he says, ""contemporary rock music
    no longer sounds young-- or, at least, not in that kind of joyous, uninhibited way.""  He goes on to inveigh
    the dearth of songs about Iraq, child prostitution, and heroin addiction, adding, ""If bands see the need
    to use electric drills instead of guitars in order to give vent to their rage, well, bring it on.""  One
    must at least give credit to the 47-year-old Hornby for admitting he's ""yet another nostalgic old codger""
    reiterating a tired argument, but while the man's obviously missing out on bands like Liars and Xiu Xiu,
    the disturbing thing about his piece is that, in some ways, it's quite accurate.</p><p>
    
    What Hornby fails to see is that this is nothing new.  Rock 'n' roll has always hovered on the brink of
    collapse, threatening to implode under the completely unrealistic expectation that it should encapsulate
    everything that makes us feel good about being alive.  Genres, like rock critics, grow old, and when that
    happens, the only thing to do is sit around and wait for young (or young-minded) guns to stumble upon a
    reincarnation.</p><p>
    
    Hornby is also wrong for indicting age as the sole reason for this process.  As proven by new records from
    Sonic Youth and Mission of Burma, all one needs to continue producing compelling rock music is a strong
    sense of adventure.  That said, you won't catch ex-Pixie Joey Santiago using an electric drill anywhere
    on <i>Smitten</i>, the new album by his band The Martinis, and while I'm sure Hornby wasn't being entirely
    literal when he made that request, its presence wouldn't hurt here, given the utter void of noteworthy
    ideas and substantive songs.</p><p>
<i>Smitten</i> is at best a vague relic of Joey Santiago's febrile axe-wielding with the Pixies, and at
    worst, feeble schmaltz that will appeal only to fans who romanticize the notion of the bar band.  The
    Martinis perform rudimentary rock songs that could have just as easily been recorded in 1994 and sounded
    dull for their time, making this record a safe pick for those who covet the blandly familiar.  But just
    as Hornby can claim amnesty in old fartdom, so too can I shield myself as a young stalwart, antsy for
    something bold and daring, and The Martinis fail to deliver.</p><p>
    
    It's obvious the band ache to rock, but in all <i>Smitten</i>'s studio polish, the beats sound canned and
    the guitars dolefully generic.  Maybe the record's problem is that it's too good; the playing is so
    controlled, every chorus so rigidly preordained and executed without error, that the music shakes off
    any potential unpredictability.  Part of the charm of the Pixies was their irreverence for sounding
    ""tight"" or expert in any way.  Perhaps their slack compositions were poignant merely as a product of
    the indolent era in which they were conceived, but <i>Smitten</i> seems a product of nothing much.</p><p>
    
    Santiago makes no apparent effort to play up his Pixies roots, but the connection is often unavoidable.
    ""You Are the One"" is a dead ringer for ""Velouria"", both in its hushed verses and its propulsive chorus,
    which features ascending 4/4 changes over a snare drum knocking out steady quarter notes.  And if Linda
    Mallari's robust vocals offer a stark contrast to the pipes we're used to hearing accompany Santiago's
    distinctive guitar work, they ultimately do little to resurrect the staid songwriting.</p><p>
    
    Aside from the blunt-edged rockers, <i>Smitten</i> features an equally repellant set of languid piano pop.
    After the sultry tango of ""Wishful Thinking"", ""Walls of Silence"" inaugurates a series of yearning, somewhat
    downtempo tracks, culminating in the obligatory closing ballad, ""Into the Meadow"".  Where the album previously
    scraped by on the bounce and brevity of tracks like ""Flyer"" and ""Out Upon the Road"", here the landscape
    turns particularly arid.</p><p>
    
    If the hardest thing to do in sports is to hit a baseball, the toughest task in music is similarly
    fundamental: writing a good rock song.  Listening to the Pixies, I'm inevitably reminded of how bafflingly
    difficult it is to make straight-up rock sound interesting.  True, it's all been done before, but never
    mind that; derivative bands like The Strokes and The Ponys still bag great songs whose lack of originality
    can be forgiven for their joyful catchiness and studied perfection.  The Martinis simply fail to stimulate
    the excitement and unchained energy that good rock bands must, and as such, <i>Smitten</i> feels tepid and
    not a little inessential.</p></div>"|5586.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5586-smitten/|3.7|Sam Ubl

<p>The downward trend continued ever so slightly with 2002's <i>The Known Unsoldier: Sick of Waging War</i>,     despite its comparative lack of filler tracks.  The standouts stick out more than ever, with ""Narcissist""     ticking and humming its way into the spot of best Non-Prophets song ever, ""Makeshift Patriot"" taking aim     at the political mechanisms behind the 9/11 aftermath, and ""I'm Gonna Getcha"" dubbing and skanking the many     ways that society's commercial structure can harm you (""B-b-bad to the bone, like the Coca-Cola you sip/     I'll get you, baby, giving you only soda to drink"").

Still, some weak cuts (""Embarrassed"", ""Inner Conflict"")     and lame extras (""Mermaids Are Seasluts"") bog the record's continuity and conviction.</p>
<p>However, <i>Sickly Business</i>, this year's pileup of odds and ends, marks the first real disappointment     in the series.  I understand that one motive behind these kinds of releases is to offer exposure to unknown     artists, but Jared Paul's ""Jesus in a Bowl of Germs"" is painful, overlong, pretentious and, if meant to be     funny (or not), a complete failure.  On the positive side, the Danger Mouse-produced ""Garden Gnomes"" is a     biting critique of the generic bedroom emcee and his fair-weather listener (""Fuck a fickle fanbase, stuck     a middle finger in their damn face""); DJ Signify's ""Cup of Regrets"" is Sage at his esoteric best; and     ""Doomage"", featuring Slug, Brother Ali and MF Doom on the beat, is an instant classic.  But regrettably, the     standouts are less plentiful here than on previous editions, and without the typically strong rarities to     back them up, the record tanks.</p>
<p>Issuing these kinds of mixes ranks among the quickest ways to gain a dedicated core of fans.

Though he initially rode high on internet buzz as one of the     harbingers of the new face of hip-hop, his emotional Anticon debut led to a severe backlash among the     independent rap massive.  Soon enough, Francis' breed of confessional emcee would become as defunct as     the <i>Hip Hop Infinity</i> website that fostered his development, and the notion that to be white was     no longer to be right in underground hip-hop would face him with a serious obstacle.</p>
<p>Fortunately, by that point, Francis had built up a strong following on the strength of the <i>Sick Of</i> CD series he'd been promoting as tour-only compilations of live, rare and spoken word tracks.  The earliest     volumes still contain some of his most accessible and highly regarded work, and have recently become more     widely available through online outlets.</p>
<p>His first salvo, <i>Sick of Waiting Tables</i>, hit hardest.  This collection contains most of Sage's work     from 1997-2000 and also houses his best overall songs.  ""Rewrite"" is both his best-known track, boasting     deeply personal and emotional lyrics that never overstep into the domain of pretension, while ""I Apologize"",     featuring Anticon cohort Sole, seems in retrospect to have been the anthem for the bearded white emcee     explosion.  The mixtape format tends to limit an artist's impact, but Sage's mix of impressive freestyles,     tongue-in-cheek battles, and an interpretation of Devo's ""Whip It"" make for his best and most enjoyable     work outside of Non Prophets' 2003 debut, <i>Hope</i>.</p>

    Having at last reached the final stage of <i>Castelvania III</i>, I was informed that my allotted daily
    hour of game time had long since passed, and that I would have to turn off the system.  Ignoring my
    squealed threats of violence, my parents yanked the power cord before I could even write down the access
    code for the last level.  As anyone who's ever played <i>Castlevania III</i> would surely understand, I
    snapped.  Limbs flailing wildly, I charged for my dad, hoping to inflict some kind of bodily harm to at
    least partially rectify the massive injustice that had been committed.</p><p>
    
    Needless to say, Nintendo meant a lot to me as a kid.  So when I heard about this, the debut album from
    California five-piece The Advantage, I just about shit a pixilated brick.  The Advantage play heavy, dynamic
    covers of Nintendo classics-- something like the bastard lovechild of Don Caballero and Mario Mario.  Driven
    largely by the always-impressive drumming of Hella guitarist Spencer Seim, The Advantage go far beyond simple
    nostalgia, exploring and often enhancing the brilliance of their source material.</p><p>
    
    The music for the Nintendo Entertainment system was created under tremendously limiting circumstances--
    during the time that most of the songs covered here were written, composers had only three individual
    voices to work with at any given time, each consisting of little more than a modified sine wave.  That
    being the case, melody was almost invariably given precedence over rhythm and texture.  In this way, the
    songs covered here offer a perfect balance to the sprawling, rhythmically intense post-rock played by
    Hella and their contemporaries-- the simplicity and melodic strength of the source material focuses the
    players, and the players flesh out the source material beyond its original technological limitations.</p><p>
    
    Of course, certain songs fare better than others.  The theme song from <i>Bubble Bobble</i>, hands-down my
    all-time favorite ""gamepak,"" is equal parts bouncy and chunky, anchored by two bass guitar tracks and Seim's
    insistent drumming.  The breezy jazz underpinnings of ""<i>Super Mario Bros. 2</i> Overworld Theme"" serve
    as another highlight, perfectly articulated by dual clean electric guitars.  Two downbeat songs from
    <i>Castlevania III</i> provide a welcome change of pace, and finally prove my theory that Radiohead's <i>The
    Bends</i> is just a thinly disguised cover of the game's soundtrack.  In fact, my only real gripes with the
    song selection here are that The Advantage inexplicably omitted their excellent version of the ""Moon Theme""
    from <i>Duck Tales</i>, a criminally underrated NES fave with a wonderfully catchy score.</p><p>
    
    Unsurprisingly, the intensely repetitive nature of the songs on <i>The Advantage</i> prevents the album from
    rising entirely above its novelty, but the band never apologizes for the whimsical nature of their content,
    and the resulting geeked-out enthusiasm makes this a great album for headbangers and button-mashers alike.</p></div>"|437.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/437-the-advantage/|7.7|Matt LeMay

    Gonzales as porcelain'd socialites, alike in seafoam and hosiery, happily lost in a cavernous, crumbling
    greystone palace.  They're ladies who lunch removed from their element and shuttered mysteriously inside
    the abandoned building.  The visual carries over to the music:  We imagine the two at first woozy from
    gin, fear and Percocets, rightfully concerned about their surroundings.  But then, in exploring the ghostly
    ballrooms, winding turrets and reverberant marble hallways, they find a fabulous and varied array of
    accordions, toy pianos, electric guitars and Moogs; and together, they begin to experiment, drawing on
    wavering folk melodies and snatches of memory from fairy tales and faraway childhood.  And <i>Snake Blue
    Bird</i> begins.</p><p>
    
    Gazic's accordion and brassy vocal flutter guides this Opera, but Gonzales' spidery, economic guitar work
    is equally essential to its peculiarly spun web.  Touches of synth atmosphere, tinny percussion (in chintzy
    electronic and quiet tambourine varieties) and toy piano also diversify the mix, shading the duo's vocal
    sketches, tricks on the mind, and persistent air of human frailty.</p><p>
    
    ""I had snakes and moths in my tummy,"" Gazic and Gonzales sing in the aptly named ""Snakes and Moths"".  ""And
    blue jays eat butterflies.""  Another voice mumbles as they harmonize, like a chattering poltergeist being
    suffocated by a throw pillow.  It's the only accompaniment to the vocal, but a perfect one, as it makes
    the song at once unsettling and pretty, like all the best fairy tales.  An accordion takes the rhythm for
    ""Lovely Day"" as Gonzales' guitar chops out a tiny jangle, while ""Aminor"" is a damaged shanty, and ""Daystar""'s
    vague gypsy sway keeps Gazic's bizarre couplets tidily afloat.  It's fascinating music, like attending a
    recital of child bands performing tentative Velvet Underground and Flaming Lips covers, and it also suggests
    those halcyon days of lo-fi, when cassette-makers amused themselves creating pop from the flimsiest of
    elements.</p><p>
    
    But that self-amusement can frustrate, too, as a track like ""Johnny Appleseed"" wavers and drifts to no real
    resolution.  Thankfully, Gazic and Gonzales keep most of <i>Snake Bird Blue</i> on the twisting track,
    never resorting to masturbatory experimentalism.  Or, they say what they mean <i>and</i> mean what they say.
    The Gonzales-penned ""Let's Pretend"" references her work with Slumber Party, while the creaky attic electronics
    of ""Build Your House"" and ""Sailor Says Goodbye""'s dreamy toy piano reflection are slight, but highly effective
    shifts in the album's ruling sonic paradigm.</p><p>
    
    The dead mannequins loved the show, clapping their clip-on limbs against neutered trunks.  Bats shuddered
    on their crown molding perch, loosing plaster dust from the ballroom ceiling.  Their high-back chairs
    encircled by instruments and glass shards, the women stared at the pale, tender patches of skin remaining
    where their high society jewelry had once gleamed coldly.  The finery had been flung down the palace's
    decrepit elevator shaft, rendered needless in this curiouser and curiouser wonderland of strange, pretty
    music.</p></div>"|8258.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8258-snake-bird-blue/|7.1|Johnny Loftus

    admire any project that stands tall under the label of ""experimental hip-hop.""  Expanding the borders
    of the most malleable of genres has got to be a good thing.  By now, forward-thinking listeners have
    at least a smattering of options that offer a rewarding, if challenging, listening experience, thanks to
    the work of dizzy-headed beat freaks like Dälek, Glen Galloway, and the Anticon alchemists.  Those artists
    not only defy presupposition, but have turned out some true class from the fickle, irresistible bitch that
    is hip-hop.</p><p>
    Traveling similar spaceways is Apsci (""applied science"" foreshortened), the product of funk-punk-turned-b-boy
    Raphael La Motta, his wife/Aussie chanteuse Dana Diaz-Tutaan, and Def Jux workhorse DJ Big Wiz.  Pairing La
    Motta's glitchy production and Wiz's turntable textures looks great on paper, a prospect even more enticing
    when Big Apple luminaries like TV on the Radio vocalist Tunde Adebimpe, Martín Perna of Antibalas, and
    hip-hop intellectual Mike Ladd appear on <i>Twisted</i>'s tracklist.  Add the assertion that the album is
    a physically unplaceable, cyberspacial collaboration, assembled from transcontinental airplane laptop
    sessions and portable studios in eight different countries, and Apsci's pastiche swells with creative
    possibilities.  Unfortunately, even as the album dips into intriguing conceptual territory, the execution
    is pretty underwhelming, and the overall sensation is of a jumbo Roman Candle of creativity that fizzles
    out before it's even fully lit.</p><p>
    La Motta's work with short-lived Thrill Jockey groove-grungers Vitapup precedes his style-mashing smarm
    with Apsci.  There's a relieving sense of humor that thankfully underlines his straight-ahead, ""Hollywood
    Freaks""-style whiteboy raps and sparse, sterile broken beats.  Without that hipster smirk, La Motta's
    lyrics would be too vapid to call quirky and his production too flagrant to call experimental.  Diaz-Tutaan's
    silky, versatile voice seems underused; she comes from an operatic background but here we get little more
    than warbled Baduizms.  If La Motta's own delivery was stronger she'd perhaps shine brighter in his presence,
    but together the couple sound more like they're pillow-talking than performing.</p><p>
    The album's first half makes Apsci's strongest statement, though a throwaway appearance by <i>3 Feet High
    and Rising</i> host Don Newkirk only emphasizes where the album fails to go, as does the De La-inspired
    role call on ""It's Apsci"".  ""Tirade Highway"" and ""Never Give Up"" bring tentative electrofunk bump, the
    first riding Atari synthlines and subliminal effects over Diaz-Tutaan's showtune vocals; the second comping
    over a routine horn sample and phase-shifted beat, letting Diaz-Tuttan's voice do the heavy lifting.
    Adebimpe's heavenly croon adds atmosphere to ""Runaway"" and illuminates the New York indie influence on
    the album, his minor-key harmonies hinting at TV's moody ruminations.  However, Perna's flute is only an
    afterthought in the sudsy ""Rob the Bank"", with its brittle rhythms and Wiz's subtle scratching barely
    discernable, and ""Synth 3PO"" is a true low point, again falling back on the Beck blueprint of plastic
    sequined soul, without the surreal heart and giddy bluster.</p><p>
    But like I said, you have to respect any serious attempt at excavating the proverbial pigeonhole.  We
    analytical Po-Mo's like the ambiguous shades that fall just after sunset but before the heavy dark of
    night, the time when fireworks can be most vivid and startling.</p></div>"|439.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/439-get-it-twisted/|6.8|Jonathan Zwickel

Have I really been so brutally chafed by this itchy,
    hand-me-down Clear Channel turtleneck that I can't cuddle up under Girlsareshort's velvet-blanket
    tweetronica?  Something must've happened on the way to my thirties, because only a couple years and
    several all-nighters ago, <i>Earlynorthamerican</i> could've rubbed me just the right way.  This is
    early-morning comedown music, quirky lullabeats buzzing along through blue skies and warm hugs, but
    I haven't grinned bleary-eyed into the sunrise in a really long time.  Maybe the drugs were good for
    me after all.</p><p>
    It's a lesson in the transitive property of music, only in reverse.  I like The Polyphonic Spree, and I
    like Underworld, but I don't think I'd like Tim DeLaughter and a giddy nine-piece choir chirping along
    to ""Dark and Long"".  Which is essentially what we get with the unflinchingly gleeful, Xanny-bar rattle of
    ""Battle Team"" and the childlike choral exhortations of ""Sunshine"", which (seemingly) earnestly inquires,
    ""Why do you wanna stay home all day/ Rather be inside than go out and play/ Come on, hang with me/ What's
    it gonna be?""  If Girlsareshort's Alex P and Daniel Z are sincere, if they're not dipping a toe in the
    chilly waters of irony, if I'm totally misreading this hopscotch hip-hop, then I'm playing <i>Earlynorthamerican</i>
    for my two-year-old nephew because this is some bangin' shit for toddlers.</p><p>
    Of course, there's a market for this music beyond the Gymboree set.  Even in its sterilized drum programming
    and cool, high-register hum, <i>Earlynorthamerican</i> is far cozier and much less daunting than labelmates
    The Russian Futurist's soaring, baroque pop, even if the two do share common G5 production values.  And any
    IDM fan will recognize the flawless-- even innovative-- technique here, though most DJs wouldn't let
    Girlsareshort's immaculate geometry near their crates.  But perhaps most alluring is the band's rosy-glassed
    twee reminiscing, evoked through cotton candy melodies, sunny analog synths, and the aforementioned falsetto
    (or possibly prepubescent) vocals.  In fact, there's a pungent whiff of winking 80s nostalgia in the glistening
    churn of ""Pinacolada"".  And yes, that <i>is</i> a sample of Rupert Holmes' campy ode to rediscovered love,
    ""Escape (The Piña Colada Song)"". If you have half a brain, or are still wearing Vuarnet and rocking Squeeze's
    <i>Argybargy</i> in your beat-up walkman, get on board.</p><p>
    There's simply no edge to this music, which can be good if you're floating in a sensory deprivation tank.
    In the real world, though, it smacks of frivolity.  There is at least some gentle contrast, as evidenced
    by the b-boy vocal sample and Hendrixian guitar snippet of ""The Natural"", or the dramatic electro bliss of
    ""Mississaga Theme"".  These songs, the album's strongest, are something like musical igloos, hand-built icy
    shells that manage to retain a fair amount of lingering warmth within.</p><p>
    Man.  I just re-read that last sentence.  God help me if I've become another shriveled, misanthropic
    music-loathing critic.  I'm just calling 'em like I feel 'em.</p></div>"|3638.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3638-earlynorthamerican/|6.7|Jonathan Zwickel

    eerily prescient.  Of course, the decision to box their earlier discs into one set came just in time for
    Christmas, but their ska sampler from earlier this year was the imprint's most politically charged release
    yet, crammed with joyous, rebellious music to meet election year head-on.  Now, with Sir Coxsone Dodd's
    passing a few weeks back, Soul Jazz's newest collection, <i>Studio One Dub</i>, cannot help but to serve
    as loving tribute to this giant of a man who not only defined popular music for the isle of Jamaica, but
    for the world over, his innovations laying the foundations for hip-hop, dance and post-rock.</p><p>
    
    As the liner notes attest, dub is the music of the studio engineers and the sound-system rulers, producers
    who expand their recorded music sans-musicians by endlessly recycling rhythms and melodies, toying with
    timing and time itself, and making ceaseless mutations using studio technology.  ""Dub plates"" originally
    alluded to the reference discs and soft acetates that studios would cut by day for exclusive airings by
    select Jamaican sound systems at night.  As the engineers started dropping the vocals in and out of the
    mix, adding effects to the remaining tracks of drum and bass, a new genre of music was formed.  Though
    never the eccentric genius caricature that Lee ""Scratch"" Perry was, nor the solid master craftsman that
    King Tubby was, Dodd's dubs drew on such a fertile ground of classic Jamaican rhythms that he rarely
    missed.  As such, it's difficult to find fault with the versions presented here.</p><p>
    
    Culling 17 selections from literally thousands of discs made by Dodd and engineer Sylvan Morris between 1966
    and 1972 is a thankless task, and will always remain a slight sampling of the music created during that era,
    but as many of these cuts are ridiculously rare (only appearing in small batches on a temporal medium,
    usually with silk-screened sleeves), their preservation in plastic is crucial to understanding the depths
    of these songs and the skills of the technicians involved.  Even the instantly recognizable beats of Horace
    Andy's ""Skylarking"", ""Mr. Jollyman"" and ""Mr. Bassie"" (renamed ""Sky Rhythm"", ""Taurus Dub No.2"", and ""Chase
    Them Version"" respectively) are tweaked in such a way as to remain unpredictable, reconfigured with new
    angles and instrumental combinations.</p><p>
    
    ""Creator Version"" strips Dawn Penn's succulent coos off of ""No No No"", revealing the sinewy bass and pumping
    elasticity underneath, while cutting Delroy Wilson's vocal is reduced to a humming trace wrapped around the
    hand drums of ""Running Dub"".  Dodd's distorted meltdown of Jackie Mittoo's organ notes for his version of
    ""In Cold Blood"" is noisy enough to make even Pan Sonic fans smile, and perhaps take a moment to realize the
    true heights of this man's unfathomable talent and unbeknownst, unassuming touch behind the boards.  Surrounded

    <i>Invention</i> has been smart, consistent, and fittingly, inventive.  The L.A. producer is a master of
    kitsch, mining vinyl for discarded melodies and cross-appropriating them in his quaint but forward-thinking
    compositions.  Daedelus seems to have unusually high regard for his source material, and his samples
    correspondingly maintain their historical sediment despite his anachronistic dust-off.  What results is
    essentially genreless compositions that are home to a wide range of sounds, musical interests and influences
    that, while consisting of pieces that might be individually unengaging, together make for challenging and
    rewarding listening.</p><p>
<i>Of Snowdonia</i>, like <i>Invention</i>, is extremely dense.  Daedelus has chosen samples of a substantially
    more unified ilk here, and to dizzying effect, he often hurdles through them seven or eight at a time.  In
    addition, Daedelus intrudes upon his samples more: guitar, standard IDM color and drum effects, and even
    his own voice peek into the mix, hoping to bridge the distance between the sampled fragments and the new
    audience.</p><p>
    
    The fast-paced ""Snowed In"" is <i>Of Snowdonia</i>'s de facto standout track.  The song is stuffed from
    beginning to end with typically and atypically Daedelian samples: the opening bouts of heavily reverbed
    percussion and bell sounds recall Pierre Henry 1960s output, while piano and guitar lines form a common
    thread that weaves through more familiar clarinet and string tones.  Daedelus then gets somewhat campy
    on ""A Sneaking Suspicion"", feted with its impenetrably film noir vibe and soap opera saxophone loop. The
    song turns glitchy and melancholic upon entrance of a grand guitar line, but regains its mystery when the
    saxophone loop comes back to complete a somewhat forced ring structure.</p><p>
    
    After ""Aim True"", Daedelus' sung ode to needlepoint aphorisms, and <i>The Price Is Right</i> game-show
    dreamscape of ""Taking Wing"", the album's most upbeat song, ""Something Bells"", makes good use of a fuzzed-out
    amateur chorus line.  The loop surfaces intermittently until getting its just due midway: ""Now's the time
    to sing and shout/ Something bells can ring about.""  A guitar loop, bell melody, and this chorus share the
    spotlight democratically.  Closer ""Hiraethus"" focuses on acoustic piano loop, with which Daedelus vocally
    harmonizes.  It's the album's shortest song, but easily its prettiest.</p><p>
    
    Yet, while Daedelus succeeds on much of <i>On Snowdonia</i>, some of its tracks suffer from one of two
    problems.  Sometimes these tracks are too reliant on their archaic samples: ""Shinkansen"", for example,
    fails to transcend its kitsch, despite being propelled by an energetic drum loop.  Other times, as on
    ""Pocket Watch Pulse"", Daedelus overcompensates for his anachronisms, miring a track in by-the-book IDM
    cliches.  Still, these are forgivable misgivings for an artist this consistently compelling, and while
    not up to his best work on <i>Invention</i>, <i>Of Snowdonia</i> nevertheless suggests that Daedelus
    still has much to offer his genre.</p></div>"|2131.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2131-of-snowdonia/|7.2|Nick Sylvester

Most obviously,
    the music must compliment the story, tone, and theme of its film so subtly and so organically that it can
    not be separated in viewers' minds from the images.  At the same time, a truly noteworthy score should be
    strong enough to play on its own as something more than background music.</p><p>
    
    Exceedingly rare is the film score that can live both lives equally well-- a few by Bernard Hermann comes
    to mind-- but most hem to one extreme or another, as is the case with Matt and Bubba Kadane's score for
    Amarillo native George Ratliff's 2001 documentary <i>Hell House</i>, which follows the congregation of the
    Dallas-area Cedar Hill Trinity Church as they stage their annual Halloween Hell House.  Instead of a typical
    haunted house, this Hell House scares visitors with everyday terrors through elaborate skits about the
    evils of homosexuality, raves, birth control, abortion, the occult, internet dating, and anything but the
    most extreme fundamentalism.</p><p>
    
    As an independent piece of music, the Kadane Brothers' score works fairly well.  Produced by Steve Albini,
    it's spare and ponderous, its dueling guitars on ""Hell"" and ""Alex"" recalling their work with Bedhead and
    The New Year.  It's also surprisingly resourceful: A banjo plucks out the precarious melody of ""Demons"",
    a trumpet plays a strange rag on the outro ""Wrestling"", and ""Sex Before Marriage"" ends with a toy piano,
    which could be a punchline.  It is a little too atmospheric and a little too aimless, structured by the
    rhythms of the scenes and not by the needs of the tunes, but at a length of around 18 minutes, it never
    overstays its welcome.</p><p>
    
    However, as a soundtrack to the film, the Kadanes' curious score sounds heavy-handed and manipulative.
    Ratliff tries (with varying degrees of success) to be objective and give the <i>Hell House</i> cast and
    organizers enough rope to hang themselves: His camera captures the implicit racism of consigning all your
    minority players to roles as drug dealers, the unintentional anti-Semitism of a six-sided ""Satanic""
    pentagram star, the competitive excitement of the Trinity Christian School students auditioning for roles
    as suicide and incest victims as if trying out for the school play.  The absurdity of the enterprise is
    painfully obvious, as is the faith of its participants, and Ratliff admirably refrains from reinforcing
    either.</p><p>
    
    However, with its ominous tone, the Kadanes' soundtrack not only misses but occasionally even undercuts
    this objectivity.  The most egregious example is ""Speaking in Tongues"", which plays in the background as
    several of the Cedar Hill congregants describe speaking in tongues during church services.  The Kadanes
    score the scene with droning guitars that sound eerie and portentous.  It is, perhaps unintentionally,
    villain music, signaling the approach of something evil and foreboding.  Glossolalia is certainly an
    intriguing phenomenon, and while the documentary wisely does not try to debate its validity, Ratliff seems
    genuinely curious and open-minded about the practice.  The Kadanes' music, though, sounds too decisive and
    almost condemning as it excuses viewers from taking the subject matter seriously.</p><p>
    
    Overall, the tone of the Kadanes' score feels worlds away from that of the movie: It sounds too judgmental
    for a film that, despite its muddled structure, at least tries to give its subjects the benefit of the
    doubt, even as it hints at the delusions of its participants.  Ultimately, <i>Hell House</i>, like so many
    documentaries, needs no soundtrack and in fact suffers from one.</p></div>"|4578.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4578-music-from-the-film-hell-house/|4.6|Stephen M. Deusner

    ""Disco,"" of course, was right around the corner, but in the mid-70s, astute dance music historians only
    recognized that term as part of a DJing process that involved extending records' best parts at clubs.
    Disco wasn't just that pounding four-on-the-floor beat, but an overt strategy of retreat from pop structure
    and obligation to the importance of the hook.  Even if party people had to wait for the chorus, they got
    their rocks off from the first downbeat, as DJs were no longer at the mercy of ""songs.""  So, while this
    meant an almost endless supply of breaks, it effectively severed ties to pop altogether.  Starting in the
    late 70s, dance music gradually became something apart from chart pop-- a music judged almost exclusively
    by its club value.</p><p>
    This is not to say there has been no crossover from dance to pop, or vice versa.  Even before disco, DJs
    were playing a mixture of funk, soul and Euro pop hits, and that inclusive practice never totally vanished.
    However, 12-inches and remixes ensured that whatever pop crossover infiltrated clubs could be manipulated
    to most perfectly suit the rather practical dancefloor aims.  In the early 80s, when Detroit DJ Juan Atkins
    was getting his Kraftwerk thing on with Cybotron, and with Derek May and Kevin Saunderson practically
    inventing techno, dance's relationship with radio pop would seem to have been irrevocably broken-- or,
    at least crafted into an alternate pop wherein ""hits"" hardly depended on widespread cultural appeal.</p><p>
    Chicago's Felix da Housecat (Felix Stallings, Jr.) has fashioned a career out of straddling the line between
    dance and pure pop-- one that should be clearly, obviously drawn after 30 years of gradual segregation.  Yet,
    in the 21st century, his music is an interesting example of how little things change.  After having made his
    bones as a 14-year-old co-producer on ""Phantasy Girl"" with house pioneer DJ Pierre in 1987, releasing a
    string of house hits in the early 90s, forming his own label Radikal Fear and producing several acclaimed
    albums and mixes (not least of which were those under his Thee Maddkat Courtship and Aphrohead aliases),
    Felix had little trouble finding an audience in the pop remix market.  Furthermore, despite a stated
    disdain for electroclash, he's often credited with jumpstarting the genre in the late 90s with his own
    synth-driven, robocentric tracks.</p><p>
    Small surprise, then, to see mixed reaction to <i>Devin Dazzle and the Neon Fever</i>, which, like his last
    record (2001's <i>Kittenz and Thee Glitz</i>), revels in a refusal to settle into one particular kind of
    jam.  Where his fellow DJs and house diehards might demand lengthy, driving tracks best suited for directing
    traffic on the floor, Felix has given them a concept pop record with great beats but three-minute tunes, as
    well as a cast of non-diva vocalists, and melodies that might actually sound better on the radio than
    pounding from club speakers.  <i>Devin Dazzle</i> details the nightlife of its title character, fascinated
    by the neon lights but tending to associate with the wrong crowd, and runs through so many micro-strains of
    electro-pop it could be a guidebook on the genre.  In fact, Felix may have crafted his magazine too carefully;
    mainstream radio probably isn't quite ready for total immersion the cynical nostalgia of synth-pop.</p><p>
<i>Devin Dazzle</i> might disappoint fans expecting more deadpan suave from <i>Kittenz</i> star Miss Kittin,
    but Felix does round up several suitable replacements.  LCD Soundsystem's James Murphy does his best
    Bowie-cum-Sylvian take on the choruses of the hard-disco platter ""What She Wants"", while Tyrone ""Visionary""
    Palmer lends his absolutely spot-on disaffected 80s tenor to the similarly on-the-mark synth-pop of ""Ready
    2 Wear"", ""Devin Dazzle"" and ""Neon Human"".  The last tune is a particularly exceptional example of fusing
    house and electronic pop, sounding like <i>Miami Vice</i> transported to The Warehouse, Jan Hammer jamming
    on Prince's keyboards and Herbie Hancock's sampler.</p><p>
    However, the girls rule the day here.  Felix has put an all-female group known as The Neon Fever to work on
    a series of cutting, sleek tracks that make up the bulk of the album.  The single ""Rocket Ride"" uses a
    double-time beat and fuzzed-out <i>Dragnet</i> riff to power their crass plea, ""Spaced out kid, won't you
    take me on a rocket ride?/  Don't say no 'cause I won't be denied/ You're my boy and I'm your girl/ Take me
    out of this messed up world.""  This request, sounding desperate at the outset of long nights hopping from
    flash to flash, is amplified when the requestor deems herself a ""technological soulmate"" while sounding
    just as sincere as a coked-out nighthawk should.  ""Everyone Is Someone in L.A."" is admirable in its fusion
    of metal guitar and note-perfect 80s techno-pop, but downright depressing in its similarly perfectly
    desensitized observations of days spent shopping on Rodeo Drive and getting thrown out of the Viper Room.
    Yet, like all good pop songwriters, Felix manages to make potentially hazardous clichés shine like Benzes
    with his ace arrangements and efficient hooks.</p><p>
    In its stubborn refusal to attempt to appeal to too many people at once, <i>Devin Dazzle</i> succeeds where
    many straight pop albums fail.  This album may come straight out of a culture obsessed with white-label
    pressings and European electronic dance music, but there's an unmistakable pop sheen that arguably predates
    electro altogether; Felix da Housecat appears to have approached this record in the same manner as other
    pop craftsmen like Stephen Merritt or Elvis Costello might: as a tireless effort to mine sub-styles and
    hooks that populate his detail-oriented visions of the perfect song.  While that might translate into a
    record that fails to sit totally comfortably in either the pop or dance section of the CD shop, it's hardly
    lacking in compositional substance or high-toned flash.</p></div>"|3030.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3030-devin-dazzle-and-the-neon-fever/|7.8|Dominique Leone

Months ago, I'd artfully
    conceived a righteous corrective of all the bum raps David Bazan has received over the years, both from
    this esteemed institution and others.  Valiantly, I'd position myself between the mournful singer/songwriter
    and the sharp arrows of our vicious kind, praising him as one of the finest modern practitioners of the
    lost concept album arts, while simultaneously mocking the IndieWorld reflex to immediately disparage anyone
    who dares discuss something so bourgeois as religion.  Oh, the gleeful self-satisfaction that would be had!</p><p>
    
    Then I heard the album.  No glee.</p><p>
    
    For starters, <i>Achilles Heel</i> finds Bazan taking a respite from the song cycles that have graced his
    last two fine efforts, <i>Winners Never Quit</i> and <i>Control</i>.  And while the Lion certainly has a
    right to an intermission from his musical Decalogue, losing the narrative push sucks the heart out of these
    songs, leaving a mope-rock shell that's less than filling.  Only the murder-tale of ""Discretion"" harks back
    to his previous style-- a short-story remnant of Bazan's minstrel talent, its bright light is obstructed
    by heavy-handed stand-alone songs about unhappiness in a socialist utopia, state infidelity, and bands
    dying in tour vans.</p><p>
    
    And then, there's the Jesus.  While Sufjan Stevens has done wonders for hypnotizing indie folk into singing
    along with Sunday School lesson plans, Bazan continues to be the face on the scene dartboard for people's
    transposed aggression against the likes of Jerry Falwell.  With hands pressed firmly over ears at the mere
    mention of the J or G words, most of these non-conformist conformists miss the context of Pedro's deity
    name-dropping, which is often as critical of organized religion (and better informed) as any of the
    Lion-haters claim to be.  To his credit, Bazan never sounds like the kind of Christian robotically following
    clerical orders, but like a man looking for something, <i>anything</i> in which to find solace from an
    oppressively bleak world.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, <i>Achilles Heel</i> does little to explain those subtleties behind its Daniel-in-the-Lion's-Den
    cover art.  While Bazan nastily skewers the kind of bible-beater he's not in ""Foregone Conclusions"" (""You
    were too busy steering the conversation toward the Lord/ To hear the voice of the spirit begging you to
    shut the fuh-uck up""), he turns in an unbelievably limp defense of faith just one track later.  ""The
    Fleecing"" appears to be a form of response to his hipster detractors, but crumples under vague answers
    and a flimsy sheep metaphor, ultimately coming off as preachy as people blindly expect Bazan to be.</p><p>
    
    Whether it's the lack of plot, insight, or collaborators, <i>Achilles Heel</i> also finds Bazan's music
    stuck in a room with no exits, with one loping distortion-pedal crawler after another.  Save ""Discretion"",
    gone are the thunderstorm drums that underscored the pathos of <i>Control</i>, sunk in the mix are the
    keyboard counter-melodies that have brightened past efforts, and what's left is Bazan wailing the rules
    to Rock Paper Scissors in ""Arizona"".  ""Keep Swinging"" half-successfully attempts an evolution of his
    approach with its cutely awkward bass groove and jarring harmonies, but it's mired in formless fuzz and
    distortion.  The surprising falsetto of the green-with-envy ""Bands with Managers"" and the deceptively peppy
    ""Transcontinental"" could make the A-team of the Pedro catalog, but it's telling that the latter track's
    ""1, 2, 3, 4"" drumstick-clack intro could lead into any track on the album.</p><p>
    
    With <i>Achilles Heel</i> so topographically uniform, it's tempting to declare the well dry for Bazan's
    sound, particularly considering how closely he veers to self-parody within this album's boundaries.  But
    after a quick refresher with his last two albums to remember why I wanted to defend his work in the first
    place, I'm willing to give David the benefit of the doubt, labeling <i>Achilles</i> a stumble rather than
    a death knell.  With concept albums coming back into style like neon clothing, it shouldn't be hard for
    Pedro the Lion to revert to reminding us in ten thematically related songs or less how ugly mankind can
    be.  Then maybe I can use that review I've got stored up for him.</p></div>"|6216.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6216-achilles-heel/|4.7|Rob Mitchum

The
    Athens, GA-based sextet make no effort to mask their climatic intentions: The warm months are their loyal
    muse, and until now, the band have seemed content to meander the verdant ruralities of the South, producing
    immersive, atmospheric pop that's humid and hazy like Athens in thickest summer.  While never groundbreaking,
    musical sojourns like those upon which Summer Hymns embark aren't easy to execute, and bear copious rewards
    when done well.  2000's <em>Voice Brother and Sister</em> and its successor, <em>A Celebratory Arm Gesture</em>,
    painted glorious, imagistic portraits of a Pan-South in eternal bloom, a fantastical vision that was in some
    ways better than the real thing for their kindly manipulation of the mind's eye.</p><p>
    2003's <em>Clemency</em> marked a change of direction, ruefully striking towards homogeneous country-rock
    territory yet managing to avoid cliché with a barrelful of strong melodies.  <em>Value Series, Vol. 1:
    Fool's Gold</em> is a cursory collection of cast-offs from the <em>Clemency</em> sessions, and while still
    uniquely Summer Hymns, it's obvious why these tracks didn't make the final cut.  In fact, if not for the
    serene beauty and unspoilt homeyness of Zachary Gresham's vocals, many of these tracks would fall completely
    flat, lacking the instrumental variety that fleshed out the band's erstwhile work.  The downtrodden Rhodes
    piano on opener ""Fear the Law"" feels uncharacteristically cagey for a band traditionally so inviting.
    ""Capsized"" is more familiar, but not as captivating and well-formed as simplistically impressionistic
    numbers like ""New Underdressment"".  All told, the album displays a band caught in flux between a reliable,
    formulaic approach to songwriting, and an obvious desire to branch out-- a perilous stage for any group.</p><p>
<em>Fool's Gold</em>'s saving grace is Summer Hymns' knack for serving up comfort tunes-- easily palatable,
    if prosaic, songs with familiar melodies and unobtrusive orchestration.  ""It's Just Not Right"", a rudimentary
    waltz with a cascading piano melody, and ""Pharmon"", a sly, downhome pop track, seem to prove Summer Hymns,
    even at their worst, incapable of writing a bad song.  ""Crazy Baby"" comes close, but even that track is
    more of an aside than a song in its 1:17 runtime.  Interestingly, the album's two strongest numbers are
    covers, an exercise for which Summer Hymns hadn't previously shown a penchant.  George Harrison's ""Behind
    That Locked Door"" is an ideal song for the group to interpret, and their version is warmly rife with gilt
    pedal steel and Gresham's understated yet moving vocals.  Meanwhile, a rendition of Johnny Watson's ""It
    Takes Two"" is slightly more upbeat, shirking the kind of cheekiness that less tactful bands might employ.
    </p><p>
    Of course, summer is still the best season, and by evoking the unmolested pulchritude of nature at its
    finest, Summer Hymns win instant sustainability by dint of their production aesthetic alone.  <em>Fool's
    Gold</em> is appreciable if only for offering a reminder of how thoroughly enjoyable Summer Hymns' previous
    work is, and how essential songs like ""Mr. Brewer (Cackle, Cackle)"" and ""Something's Going On"" are to the
    inauguration of any successful Memorial Day Weekend in my seaside neighborhood.  Unfortunately, spinning
    <em>Voice Brother and Sister</em> and relishing the greening cusp of summer is about all <em>Fool's Gold</em>
    compels me to do.  Perhaps the forthcoming second volume will fare better in producing the vibrant
    portraits of summer to which the bandname alludes.  If not, I may just have to settle for the real thing.

I walked to the record store yesterday listening to Justus Köhncke,
    dreaming about Xcaret and Viet girls who refuse to wear their hair up.  This is a time for opening up your
    cold, wet fists and letting the sun burn your palms like oversized smiles.  It doesn't have to mean anything,
    walking next to the joggers and disc-footballers in the soccer field, our insides bursting, grinning in the
    knowledge that God's favorite season is here.  The answer is clear: Step inside the record store and tell
    the first girl you meet that she's beautiful.  Ask her to walk outside, come see how even the kids stuck
    in lessons on the tennis courts know what's going on, how you knew she was the one even before opening the
    broken front door.  These things only make sense a few weeks a year, so now is the time.</p><p>
    German fantasy disco perpetrator Köhncke has scored a near-perfect double-sided anthem for the finest season
    with his latest Kompakt 12-inch, <i>Zwei Photonen</i>.  ""Timecode"" and ""The Answer Is Yes"" shimmer with the
    careless, shortsighted euphoria that dies out on cue come September.  This is music that in the dog days of
    August, and the splendor of midsummer, seems telegraphed from some omniscient machine, transmitting electro-beats
    and Korg lines as if they were just another part of getting burnt and dancing until four.</p><p>
    Furthermore, Köhncke has suddenly appeared to find his calling as a New Romantic soul man.  Unlike last year's
    fine ""Homogen"" single, his textures on this record forgo the normally cool Kompakt template, opting for an
    unabashedly red (or pink) palette of sounds.  2002's <i>Was Ist Musik</i> had hinted that Köhncke could be
    a fine disco archivist, pulling grooves out of the Moroder handbook, and adding his own pseudo-smooth vox
    to accentuate the hooks.  As it happened, his smooth, yet precisely enunciated singing style made me a bit
    uncomfortable-- prior to this 12-inch, my fave vocal performance on a Köhncke track was Erlend Øye's a
    cappella on ""2 After 909"" from his <i>DJ Kicks</i> mix.</p><p>
    ""The Answer Is Yes"" changed my mind.  The B-side of this release makes the case that Köhncke could seduce
    anyone, provided he's armed with this track's classic 80s synth-pop arrangement and infallible chorus,
    and psychedelic summer love.  The tempo is ultra-slow and those drums hit hard, like Barry White gone
    robotic; the chord progression is born from <i>Pet Sounds</i> and ""Strawberry Fields"", giving ample room
    for Köhncke to let his breathy stylings run wild.  He sings in German for the verses, leaving long spaces
    between his elongated phrases for the reverb to splash up against any bodies in range.  At the chorus, he
    intones ""the answer is yes, yes, yes,"" as if it wasn't entirely obvious.</p><p>
    The dancefloor gets hers on ""Timecode"", with another efficiently executed take on Moroder-powered
    electro-disco.  However, keeping in the summery spirit, its strains are extroverted rather than micro;
    buoyant and flashy instead of hip and minimal.  If you're doing a mix, don't lead off with it, but put
    it near the top because it can sustain whatever you have going; if you're playing <i>Vice City</i>, let
    it blare as you wreak havoc through the streets, cab surfing and racking up stars.  <i>Zwei Photonen</i>
    (or the apt ""two photons"") inaugurates summer with a diamond glare and the wise purr of whomever you hear
    it with.  Don't waste this stuff.  You know it only comes along once a year.</p></div>"|4576.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4576-zwei-photonen-ep/|8.0|Dominique Leone

His background
    is common knowledge amongst gossipy indiescenti-- most of us decided long ago to fall in with either the
    red-eyed, pill-popping Tweedy Nation or the temperate, button-down Family Farrar.  Fans of the former
    Tupelans are vehemently passionate, after all, and stylistically, speaking it seems there's little common
    ground between the two camps.  Farrar's life after the tentatively hiatused Son Volt has been inconsistent
    at best, uninspired at worst, but nevertheless his muse still hangs on.  For some it's been tough watching
    an icon produce sub-standard material, but neither Farrar nor his devoted, corduroyed following give a shit
    about popular opinion.</p><p>
    
    In the wake of the tepid response given his solo outings, including 2003's intermittently impressive
    <i>Terroir Blues</i>, Farrar hit the road for a national tour, taking psych-country balladeers Canyon as
    both his opener and backing band.  <i>Stone, Steel &amp; Bright Lights</i> is a collection of songs from that
    tour, recorded during several different shows over the course of September and October.  Released on his
    own newly re-christened Transmit Sound label (formerly Act/Resist), the disc's 78-minute runtime offers a
    liberal dose of Farrar's word-drunk Americholia-- especially considering that, even with pistons firing,
    the music never hits terminal velocity.</p><p>
    
    You can't fault Farrar for knowing what he does best after all these years.  He certainly has a strong grasp
    of what his people want-- obliquely evocative lyrics, saccharine melodies-- as exemplified by his typically
    rote showing on the album's first third.  New tune ""Doesn't Have to Be This Way"" opens, setting the Adult
    Contemporary mood before ever so slightly roughing it up with some astral slide guitar from Canyon's Joe
    Winkle.  The other new original premiered on this tour, ""6 String Belief"", reveals that Farrar is perhaps
    more riled by his critics than they might believe: ""Killed by consolidation/ Killed by saturation/ The
    underground will correct/ With reaction rebellion.""</p><p>
    
    From there, we're given vintage Farrar, boosted by the expansive wail and surge of Canyon's elegantly
    ringing guitars.  Farrar's hearty, amber tenor is poignant and strong, and Canyon makes an excellent (if
    not fully fleshed-out) turn behind it.  Though they give much-needed guts to mawkish <i>Sebastopol</i>
    tunes like ""Make It Alright"" and ""Vitamins"", the group shines brightest when they really dig in and stretch
    out.  ""Cahokian"" shows Canyon hitting full stride halfway through their set, with Vin Novarra's tribal
    drums and Brandon Butler's lap steel shaking up the dynamics a bit.  Later, Farrar allows another
    <i>Terroir</i> tune, ""Fool King's Crown"", to almost get its rocks off with some spacey keys and groaning
    guitar before abruptly winding it down.</p><p>
    
    Not surprisingly, the album's most intriguing moments come with its covers.  First appearing on Pink Floyd's
    <i>Piper at the Gates of Dawn</i>, ""Lucifer Sam"" was Syd Barrett at his most menacing, and here Canyon crunches
    into its twisted drama with an iron fist, doing justice to the original.  To close the album, ""Lucifer Sam""
    rolls right into Neil Young's anthemic ""Like a Hurricane"", which with its tender vocal delivery would be
    perfectly suited to Farrar were his instrumentation not so polished.</p><p>
    
    As long as Farrar keeps the world in limbo over the status of Son Volt, it'll be tough to take his solo
    output as the final gospel.  Albums like this, while often appealing to the hardcore Farrar fan (redundant,
    I know), don't add much to his overall cache.</p></div>"|2999.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2999-stone-steel-and-bright-lights/|6.5|Jonathan Zwickel

    nine-minute ""First Wave Intact"", the lead-off track on The Secret Machines' awkwardly titled debut album,
    <i>Now Here Is Nowhere</i>.  The rhythms are military-precise, locked-in and steady, but they're less heavy
    metal than <i>Heavy Metal</i>: The band sounds as though they're scoring an intergalactic space battle, or
    perhaps something more terrestrial, like the lurching onslaught of a thousand warbeasts.</p><p>
    
    Or maybe it's just the march of the marketing behemoth behind <i>Now Here Is Nowhere</i>, which is one of
    the first major label albums to be released for commercial download before its official street date.  In
    Phase 1 of the assault, the album was posted on the band's website and on select retailers like iTunes,
    along with a free five-song EP (containing the well-worth-it outtake, ""Cannon"").  For Phase 2, Reprise
    released an early version of <i>Now Here Is Nowhere</i> in a ""babypack""-- a simple sheaf of cardboard with
    minimal graphics and a low price.  And now, we've arrived at the final phase of the master plan-- the
    album's actual release, for which the label presumably hopes all those people who downloaded it or bought
    the tyke-size version will either spring for the ""real"" album or at least have told all their friends about
    it.</p><p>
    
    It's too early to tell whether this three-pronged attack will actually succeed, but if it doesn't, it won't
    be the band's fault.  Veterans of Dallas-area groups like UFOFU and Tripping Daisy, these three New Yorkers-by-way-of-Texas--
    drummer Josh Garza and brothers Ben and Brandon Curtis-- build a classic rock front to launch a full-out
    musical assault.  Garza's imperturbable drums stand strong against Brandon Curtis' guitar explosions and
    Ben Curtis' psych-rock keyboard scribbles.  Early reviews of <i>Now Here Is Nowhere</i> have likened the
    band to 70s-era Pink Floyd, a comparison that is limited but not unwarranted.  ""Pharaoh's Daughter"", for
    example, turns on an elegant <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i> chord change and a volley of ""Us and Them"" voices
    in the chorus.</p><p>
    
    But The Secret Machines are no nostalgia act: ""Pharaoh's Daughter"" counters the Floyd references with a
    drumbeat practically quoted from Isaac Hayes' cover of Bacharach's ""Walk on By"".  Plus, they deploy a
    strategy similar to that of The Flaming Lips and Grandaddy: Not only is Garza more Steve Drozd than John
    Bonham (which could be a compliment), but The Secret Machines create songs that are just as spacey and
    concept-heavy, if not quite as quirky, as those on <i>Yoshimi</i> and <i>The Sophtware Slump</i>.  ""Leaves
    Are Gone"" lolls along on the delicate ebb and flow of Brandon Curtis' keyboard cascades, forming a quiet
    counter to more aggressive songs like ""Sad and Lonely"".  ""Light's ON"" boasts a better new wave hook than
    just about anything else to come out of NYC this year, crackling with a palpable paranoia as Curtis decries
    the intrusiveness of a Big Brother-like observer: ""Somewhere there's a record of your whereabouts/ Everywhere
    you go you leave a trace.../ The light's ON/ We don't know just who our friends are.""  But there are forces
    allied against these threats, people who thrive in the underground: ""The light's ON/ And we're waiting for
    the signal.""</p><p>
    
    The nervous lyrics and jittery energy of ""Light's ON"" underscore the pervasiveness of the military imagery
    on the album, revealing a directed-- if not entirely legible-- political agenda.  On ""Pharaoh's Daughter"",
    Curtis describes a brewing rebel movement in life-during-wartime language: ""We dressed in uniforms left over
    from the war/ A tourniquet, an iron vest/ Our emblem was a star.""  A lone star, perhaps.</p><p>
<i>Now Here Is Nowhere</i> pulses with a sexual tension that matches the swagger of the Texas-size drums
    on songs like ""Nowhere Again"", when Curtis sings, ""There's a woman in the mirror in a fiery state/ As she
    motions to me I start turning away/ She's lifting her dress up/ Trying to keep up.""  While this erotic
    energy threatens to undercut the political tensions on the album, it actually humanizes and intensifies
    them.</p><p>
    
    The meaning behind all this political and sexual intrigue is a little vague.  The ""Now"" and the ""Here"" of
    the album title apparently describe America during its war on terrorism, but beyond that, the album's
    most specific statement is that rock music, regardless of influences or labels, can still be a subversive
    agent in society.  Although the sound is bombastic, the message is subtler and variable from one listener
    to another.  <i>Now Here Is Nowhere</i> may sound like a full-on assault, but it's actually a covert
    spec-ops infiltration, as the name Secret Machines suggests; the band step loudly but carry a concealed
    weapon.  Politically, this reticence could have been a cop-out, but aesthetically, it leaves the album
    open for interpretation, which means it should have a longer life than the current administration.</p></div>"|7057.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7057-now-here-is-nowhere/|8.2|Stephen M. Deusner

    encore.""  In the case of folks who live in the middle of nowhere, the nuggets of stadium-sized atmospherics
    offer a vicarious pleasure: ""Man, now I know what 'Truckin'' would sound like as a seventh encore.""
    Completists pay top dollar for these watery simulations, which generally only amount to lackluster archival
    material to occasionally inspire the indulgent juvenilia of sounding out banal rocker interactions with an
    invisible crowd.  While in writing, Current 93's <i>Halo</i> could be nonchalantly tagged as just such an
    offering, David Tibet's most recent live album transcends the bedraggled genre, coming off like its own
    heroic monster.</p><p>
    
    Nobody would deny that David Tibet's a busy guy.  Between his Durtro label, Ghost Story Press, and numerous
    recording projects and collaborations, it's a wonder the English renaissance man's able to release any new
    material by his own meat-and-potatoes act.  Though Current 93 is scheduled to play a string of shows in
    Toronto this June with Six Organs of Admittance, the crew's stateside gigs are extremely rare.  In fact,
    even some of C93's most ardent followers have only caught glimpses of their reclusive icon in grainy black
    and white photos or web glossies.  In this sense, a Current 93 live album makes more sense than a similar
    project by the endlessly touring Dave Matthews.  Another plus is that Tibet's songs exist nicely in larger
    spaces: the piano stretches its legs, the bass grumbles, the cello scurries underfoot, the violin mewls.</p><p>
    
    Recorded pristinely at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London on October 9th, 2003, during a shared-headlining
    gig with Cosey Fanni Tutti and Chris Carter (both ex-Throbbing Gristle), the set includes 16 tracks covering
    much of C93's recorded history from the early years to his most recent opus, <i>Hypnagogue</i>.  The setlist
    moves comfortably between aesthetic eras in Tibet's oeuvre: ""The Death of the Corn"" from 1990's <i>Horse</i>
    makes an appearance, as do ""Whilst the Night Rejoices Profound and Still"" and ""The Signs in the Stars""
    from 1998's <i>Soft Black Stars</i>, and 1994's ""All This World Makes Great Blood"" from <i>Of Ruine or
    Some Blazing Starre</i>.</p><p>
    
    While not every track beguiles, the most interesting compositions receive an extra layer of flesh.  The
    opener, ""Halo"", swivels on the same scratchy loop as 1995's lengthier ""Where the Long Shadows Fall"".  Tibet
    gently intones his <i>Theinmostlight</i> trilogy's continual question (""Why can't we all just walk away?"")
    as strings, tunings and tentative swells gradually come to the fore.  As the set continues, 1992's ""Mary
    Waits in Silence"" picks up hypnotic Gregorian background chants and the stutter-step of flanged soloing
    guitar; ""A Silence Song"", a perennial favorite also from <i>Thunder Perfect Mind</i>, is as dainty as
    ever but the melancholic instrumentation rises and falls with Tibet's voice more clearly than on the
    album (the pianos are especially stirring); ""So: This Empire Is Nothing"" sprouts a singing saw that takes
    flight as an extended breakdown buttressed by ecstatic applause.  A slightly compacted ""Sleep Has His
    House"", prefaced with Tibet's whisper that ""this is in memory of my father,"" receives a less droning
    piano/cello/violin makeover.  I ultimately prefer the original, lengthier version, but hearing the track
    receive the explosive pop treatment is an interesting sideswipe.</p><p>
    
    The proceedings trail off with ""Locust"" from 1987's <i>Imperium</i>.  It's the first time Tibet performs
    ""Locust"" live, and he opts to give it the royal apocalyptic treatment: deranged voices, walls of white
    noise, squeaks, howls, squawks, metal bass, industrial sprouts, choirs of devils, crazed strings, noise
    guitar, and subaltern gnarls drift around Tibet's anguished libretto: ""What joy we had/ In the locust
    summers/ What fires we lit/ In the locust years.""  C93 has always been as much about the music as Tibet's
    larger-than-life personality and obsessions.  In a live setting, he chews the scenery and spits it out in
    a handful of colors (mostly rippled with red); and this here, Tibet's masterstroke, is frantic Glassian
    New Music performed by hellhounds.</p><p>
    
    Pulling a wonderful rabbit out of his hat, the set concludes with a child, Finn Sands, telling the audience
    that ""God Is Love"" and imploring them to ""watch and pray.""  This placement immediately after the most intense
    of songs transforms the boy's sweet British voice into an ominous warning: Who knows what the Four Horsemen
    will look like, so watch your back and lock the doors.</p><p>
    
    As should be expected, <i>Halo</i> doesn't possess the same dense narrative arc as Current 93's strongest
    studio efforts, and newcomers should search out the tried and true classics like <i>Thunder Perfect Mind</i>
    or <i>All the Pretty Little Horses</i> before jumping into this sort of collection.  For seasoned veterans,
    though, it's a thrill to hear the band's often hermetic sounds bloom before an audience of adoring fans.
    I wish I could see all the faces and lighters, because even just listening to the acolytes whoop it up
    after the foreign lands of ""Fields of Rape"" is honest-to-god spine-shivering rock 'n' roll fun.</p></div>"|1751.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1751-halo/|7.8|Brandon Stosuy

Purchasing a large cattle ranch near Arroyo Grande, which he renamed Tally-Ho, Vachell bred ponies and even socialized in the costume of the sport.  His greatest acclaim came from the 1905 novel <em>The Hill</em>, an aristocratic Icarus fable in which the son of a Liverpudlian merchant attends the elite Harrow boarding school, rising to cricket prominence before his evitable downfall and dismissal due to class difference.  On his adopted home Vachell wrote, ""In addition to the family fool, the Englishman to be found on the Pacific Slope include the parson's son, the fortune teller, the moral idiot, the remittance man, and the sportsman.""</p><p>  One could lob three of those labels at Steven Morrissey, the most unremittingly Albion presence in modern Los Angeles, but he remains an entirely unique breed of Englishman in home or Hollywood.  Bitter, witty, hypocritical, contradictory, self-aware, sardonic, and nostalgic, Morrissey's persona-- in person, or in song-- is never one-dimensional or quickly read.  Consider the ""I"" in his songs to represent ""Morrissey"" with peril.</p><p>  The media and his audience have consistently misinterpreted Morrissey's lyrics and statements.  Everyone from the Warlock Pinchers to the Windsors levied opinions at his persona.  The trend continues with <em>You Are the Quarry</em>.  The record is not an anti-American treatise, an encomium to England, an epistolary revelation, or even a bold comeback, and magazines who claim such are lazy and reading off the kit.  Laden with brilliant contradictions, press baiting rouse, dark comedy, and real human complexity, <em>You Are the Quarry</em> simply stands as the most entertaining and lushly melodic work of Morrissey's solo career, one of the most singular figures in Western pop culture from the last 20 years.</p><p>  In an epitomatory 1989 interview with <em>Greenscene Magazine</em>, Morrissey castigated those in chinchilla coats.  ""It's disgusting.  They're disgusting,"" he spat.  ""If I see someone wearing fur I ask them to take it out of view.""  In the same interview, he pointed out that synthetic shoes ""look silly"" and confessed to wearing leather footwear, as there's ""no sensible alternative.""  The first scenario seems unlikely and makes for a comedic envisioning (At the Savoy: ""Excuse me, madam, but that rabbit shawl must be taken out of public view""), while the second statement reiterates that Morrissey never forsakes his role as photo-ready icon and dapper fashionist for a few cows.</p><p>  Similarly, when he puts his hands on the hips of Liverpool and Hull to slowdance with England in ""Come Back to Camden"", the lyrics should be taken with the whole of the Winsford Rock salt mine.  Obviously, a ""discoloured dark brown staircase,"" a ""slate grey Victorian sky,"" and ""the taste of the Thames"" fail to paint a whimsical postcard of home.  Even those who've never choked for air while riding the 15 down Fleet Street can read the sarcasm without a spider map.  Yet those weeping synthetic strings (violins and cellos use catgut and horsehair, by the way) flash ""I miss you"" in garish American neon.</p><p>  When Morrissey humorously mocks Americans with, ""You wonder why in Estonia they say, 'Hey, you, big fat pig, you fat pig,'"" we laugh because most Americans don't know what Estonia is, let alone where it lies on the Baltic; fat Americans travel to Tucson not Talinn.  Each of <em>You Are the Quarry</em>'s 12 songs contains an equally delicious line.  In ""Let Me Kiss You"", which incidentally features the most romantically melodic quasi-Marr guitar, Morrissey pulls the mask off an ostensible smooching ballad with the desperate gob of, ""And then you open your eyes and you see someone you physically despise but my heart is open."" Those artificial maudlin strings that sweep back in afterwards seem like the most appropriately feeble yet crushing sound on the record.  The supposed ode to his Hispanic fans, ""First of the Gang to Die"", even contains poetic and dreadful images like solar illumination sparkling in cement reservoirs and on human bone.</p><p>  Two songs drive home Morrissey's modi operandi.  On ""The World Is Full of Crashing Bores"", the fear of being a suburban meatsuit and an opposing love of cheap pop thrills drives him to an ending refrain of sincerely conveyed cliche with ""Take me in your arms and love me.""  The album closes with the quiff quivering mammoth, ""You Know I Couldn't Last"".  Morrissey's tommy gun is pointed directly at the pop stars who take their passing charge with less zeal and erudition than himself.  Robbie Williams and Jason Mraz would never use ""gelignite"" and ""evil legal eagles"" in a chorus, or dare stick their neck out for the critics. ""The teenagers who love you, they will wake up, yawn, and kill you,"" he croons.  At his most biting he sounds most relaxed.  At his most self-deprecating he sounds most energized.  By the time the title comes up, after ""there's a cash register ringing and it weighs so heavily on my back,"" it's again clear that ""I"" is not the first person.  But it could be.</p><p>  Like fellow Southern Californians Harry Nilsson and Randy Newman, Morrissey shows no fear of offending or wrapping emotions in black humor, while exhibiting a deep passion for classic songwriting forms.  Few-- possibly none-- would call the police ""uniformed whores"" and mockingly thank Jesus for bestowing him with love for which there is no receptacle on an album bulging with desire and soppy diapason.  With a producer to match the vocal boldness of Morrissey, the record could have been pushed, musically, in a futuristic cinescope folk direction similar to recent The Flaming Lips.  Flutes and piano and electric squelches peep through the sidewalk of simple lulling rhythms, acoustic guitar, and synthesizers.  Jerry Finn, a Hollywood hack, knows only to throw all the parts out there with money stuffed in the panties.  Prancing the choice embellishments in polo gear and avoiding standard rock mixing would have made the album perfect.</p><p>  That's a rather considerable caveat to tag on the end on a review, but if you're listening to Morrissey albums for riffs and licks you're missing the point.  Any instrumental bed under such incandescent personality and booming voice would pale.  Envisioning the songwriter at work brings to mind a woman picking at an acoustic or a fellow hunched over a piano with a drink.  The genesis of Morrissey music remains ambiguous both physically and in intent.</p><p> <em>You Are the Quarry</em> sounds effortless, and seemingly anything that pours from Morrissey's mouth comes wrapped in well-formed wit and melody. Some may want him to simply yearn for his homeland, or a woman, or a man, or bitterly attack pop stars or American culture, as this is seen as some sort of bold personal statement, but personalities rarely run down such black and white divisions.  Creating an emotionally muddled, cantankerous, baroque, funny, longing, introspective, world-critiquing album is the most personal act a man like Morrissey makes.  It trickles down to the logo on the cover, the resuscitated Attack imprint, a vinyl reggae label that has no relation to his music, yet reflects the taste and scholarship and attitude of man who began his career in music writing geeky teenage letters to <em>NME</em> begging for better New York Dolls coverage.</p><p>  Often during the course of writing a review, as the CD plays again and again for the 13th and 14th times, a critic finds himself convincing himself more and more that the record is essential.  Morrissey's nature inherently emboldens those looking to make a statement, and now that he's on the mark, I similarly feel the need to stick out my neck for his record.  Then again, Horace Vachell eventually sold the ranch and moved back to England.  You can go home again.</p><p> </p></div>"|5437.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5437-you-are-the-quarry/|8.9|Brent DiCrescenzo

    musical elements finally fall into place: In the chorus of ""Let It Go"", after vocalist Dominique Durand
    has sung the verse, multi-instrumentalist Andy Chase joins her unexpectedly, singing a slight, plaintive
    melody around her words.  It's a nice touch, not just because Durand and Chase are wife and husband, nor
    because they have a history together in the band Ivy, but because all the possibilities of this side project
    finally come into view.  This simple, short duet is a turning point on an album that, at least for its first
    half, feels like the band's potential may never be realized.  In addition to Durand and Chase, Paco includes
    studio engineer Gary Maurer and guitarist Michael Hampton who build on Ivy's sound by texturing Durand's
    vocals with dense, atmospheric keyboards and programmed drums.</p><p>
    
    Side projects, of course, can be sweeping successes (like, say, The New Pornographers), capturing the
    lightning-in-a-bottle dynamic of musicians working together for the first and maybe the only time.  Or
    they can be instantly forgettable (like, say, King Biscuit Time), lacking the chemistry or a distinct
    enough sound to justify a new line-up.  As it begins, <i>This Is Where We Live</i> falls squarely into
    the latter category.  Songs like the ambitiously titled leadoff instrumental ""Satie"" sound so ephemeral
    that they dissipate as the notes emerge from the speakers, while others never seem fully developed, as
    if they need a second draft.  ""Adore"" hinges on an awkward chorus and trite rhymes, while ""Shaded"" sounds
    like an ill-advised cover of another band's song: Durand's soft-focus vocals, which are perfect for
    conveying Ivy's urbane casualness, simply cannot believably sell lyrics as dark and cynical as ""Everything,
    everyone/ Every word you've ever heard is a lie/ Don't buy the dream.""</p><p>
    
    After this initial awkwardness, however, Paco begin to loosen up considerably on ""Let It Go"", playing off
    one another with more confidence and achieving a unified direction.  It almost sounds like they recorded
    the album in tracklist order, as they become increasingly dynamic and eclectic with each song.  ""Who Do
    You Think You Are?"" is a moodier and slightly darker version of the shimmering pop Ivy nearly perfected,
    while the music on ""Thin"" creates a nice summer's-day groove out of Hampton's reggae-inflected rhythms.
    Whereas Durand sounds a bit sheepish near the album's beginning, she gives one of the most accomplished
    performances of her career on ""Promises"", where Hampton successfully connects his textured music to her
    voice, neither drowning her out nor completely abandoning her.  The bouncy final track, ""Never"", which
    evokes the ethereality of Air, provides the album with a soaring outro in Hampton's George Harrison-style
    slide guitar.</p><p>
    
    Though the promising second half of <i>This Is Where We Live</i> cannot quite compensate for its flat first,

    velocity of any object or radiation exceeds the speed of light, thus making escape from the hole's gravitational
    pull impossible under the laws of space-time as we currently understand them.  A black hole isn't literally
    a hole so far as we know, but it comes close, given that it has no volume despite its infinite density-- we
    can't even know what a singularity looks like because it's obscured by something called the event horizon,
    beyond which all light is trapped.</p><p>
    Though it can be explained by pages' worth of dry theory and alien-looking math equations, it's difficult to
    deny the inherent romance of the concept.  Once you've passed beyond the event horizon, your only hope is
    that you're crushed into oblivion quickly enough that you feel nothing-- that light can't even escape its
    clutches is especially chilling and fascinating.  Songwriters being a generally romantic lot, it's surprising
    that the fertile symbolic ground of these cosmic phenomena hasn't been more thoroughly plowed-- most
    songwriters just focus on the stuff you can actually see, like the moon and the stars.  But Paul Schneider,
    your friendly guitar-toting servant (and not the guy from Múm), has apparently noticed this oversight, and
    attempts to remedy it on the opening track of his debut album.</p><p>
    ""Event Horizon (Pulls a Body)"" is a lushly melodic song that nicely captures the essence of attraction
    amidst discord in a relationship-- even as his paramour does all she can to degrade him and crush his
    spirit, he's slipped past her event horizon, and now he's drawn to her despite himself.  Schneider does
    an impressive job of keeping a potentially hazardous metaphor under control while his acoustic guitar
    bubbles over spare drum machines, his tenor's peculiar blend of gravel and nasal resonance articulating
    a deeply ingratiating melody.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, Schneider's studied melodicism is at its best on uptempo songs like ""Don't Walk Around"", its
    bounding, unison-harmony hook met by a slightly distorted guitar riff placed low in the mix.  Producer
    Dave Snyder keeps the bass sound loose and sharp, letting the drums and guitar do most of the rhythmic
    heavy lifting.  ""Echo of Your Heart"", however, is the undeniable highlight, with its brisk rhythms sweeping
    along Schneider's fluid melody.  Here, guest guitarist Oscar Rodriguez leads the band into a bloodrush coda
    that finally pulls back for a slowly churning, chiming outro.</p><p>
    Rodriguez also breaks open the midsection of the country-ish ""Tourniquet"" with a positively liquid solo,
    and provides the menacing bassline for ""Waiting"", the album's darkest, loosest song.  Schneider handles
    the lead guitar himself on ""Waiting"", with a choice outburst near the three-minute mark.  His leads on
    ""Man"" enter more Stephen Stills-ish territory, ringing in the lower registers, with the top EQ'd off for
    a strange, mellowing effect.</p><p>
<i>Escape Velocity</i> is an accomplished debut for a promising young songwriter who thankfully seems as
    interested in the musical content of his songs as the lyrical.  Fans of recent offerings by (to pigeonhole)
    neo-folkies like Tom McRae will definitely find much to like here, though the appeal certainly doesn't stop
    there: <i>Escape Velocity</i> is also a solid indie rock record, announcing the arrival of a songwriter to
    look out for.</p></div>"|7762.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7762-escape-velocity/|7.5|Joe Tangari

<p>As well as textual linkages, the two artists shared a mutual admiration.  In a brief article on her     performance at London's Royal Festival Hall, Acker called Galás the Maria Callas of her generation.     In my mind, generations are broad and formless; so more specifically, Galás is a graveyard Callas (sans     corpsepaint) who channels anonymous victims and sings their eulogies.  In keeping with her baroque oeuvre     and aesthetic, <i>Defixiones, Will and Testament</i> and <i>La Serpenta Canta</i>, Galás' first full-lengths     since 1998's <i>Malediction and Prayer</i>, are densely wound, parabolic double albums.  Released concurrently,     each documents a very different approach, though both are by far creepy enough to make even the gothest     shiver.</p>
<p><i>Defixiones, Will and Testament</i> is a meditation on the Armenian, Assyrian and Anatolian Greek genocides     carried out by Turkey from 1914 to 1923, and the Turkish and American denial of the atrocities.  According     to a statement about the project at Galás' website, ""'Defixiones' refers to the warnings engraved in lead     that were placed by relatives of the deceased on the graves of the dead in Greece and Asia Minor.  These     warnings cautioned against moving or desecrating the corpses under the threat of extreme harm.  'Will and     Testament' refers to the last wishes of the dead who have been taken to their graves under unnatural     circumstances.""  Like 1990's <i>Plague Mass</i>-- a work for people with AIDS, inspired in part by the     death of her brother, the playwright Philip Dimitri Galás, who succumbed to the disease in 1986-- once     Galas affixes her sound to something concrete, the effects are often near sublime.</p>
<p>As we chalk up important numbers of the dead (on calendars, and outlined out sidewalks) and commemorate     days of mass murder, <i>Defixiones</i> issues a creepy formal purity, as Galás discusses ethnic cleansing:     choirs rage, skies are torn, Galas speaks in tongues.  In ""Orders from the Dead"", ""Our dead watch their     daughters butchered, raped, and beaten in the still burning of those flames.""  In light of the tortures at     Abu Ghraib, notions of genocide and violence are currently in the forefront of many minds (and even <i>USA     Today</i>).  Certain lines like, ""A man without a God/ Cannot be burned alive/ He never was alive/ Not as     a man, giavour/ But as a dog,"" coupled with recent imagery of Iraqis on leashes, expands Galás' anger to     encompass more than her initial subject.  Towards the song's end, she turns her phraseology towards the     humanizing first person and achieves the voice of victimhood: ""I am the man unburied/ Who cannot sleep/     In forty pieces.""</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the cycle, she incorporates and expands traditional compositional forms from Smyrna and Asia     Minor and poems and by Armenian poet Siamanto, Syrian poet Adonis, Peruvian poet Cesar Vallejo, and     Rumanian-Jewish poet Paul Celan.  Throughout <i>Defixiones</i>' 99 minutes, Galás accrues packs of     identities, all looking for remembrance.  It's a chilling agglomeration: More about absence than a     cult-of-personality, the soul-catching proves an angry and unmanageable lament riddled with grief, often     as laden as it is uplifting.</p>
<p><i>La Serpenta Canta</i>, on the other hand, is surprisingly playful, tackling major standards and classics     of American blues, country &amp; western, R&amp;B;, Motown, and soul.  Each, of course, becomes hers alone.  For     instance, when Galás holds a particularly cackling note towards the three-quarter mark of Screamin' Jay     Hawkins' ""I Put a Spell on You"", it's the stuff of a real hex, not just an interpretation of another's     poetry.  This is followed by a restrained take on Chip Moman and Dan Penn's ""At the Dark End of the Street"",     which proves more Tom Waits than the violently cascading Pandora's Box that erupts at the coda of her     reprisal of John Lee Hooker's ""Burning Hell"", a song she performs twice here with equally glorious results.     Elsewhere, her guttural ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"" transforms Hank Williams' tear-in-my-beer ballad into     a spiraling downpour that carries with it a banshee wail from the top of Mount Olympus.</p>
<p>But despite these warped old favorites, it's her own ""Baby's Insane"" that steals the show.  Taken from     <i>The Sporting Life</i>, her unlikely but surprisingly fruitful 1994 pop-art collaboration with Led     Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones becomes the campiest of torch songs in a live setting.  Recorded at     Joe's Pub in NYC on August 31st, 2001, the cabaret lilts, and she jokes with the audience about the     song's macabre subject matter before issuing the central warning: ""Baby's insane/ Baby's insane/ Baby's     on a trip to the morgue again/ Hide all the knives/ 'Cause baby's insane.""</p>
<p>Though <i>La Serpenta Canta</i> consists of lighter fare than the gorgeously pained <i>Defixiones, Will     and Testament</i>, there are stylistic linkages (Galás, after all, is Galás).  In both, the palette     consists of her voice, piano and minimal electronics.  Another less stylistic connector is the     across-the-board inclusion of the traditional ""See That My Grave Is Kept Clean"".  Equally powerful on     both releases, the song's central request (""There's just one last favor I'll ask of you/ See that my     grave is kept clean"") carries more intense resonances in the context of <i>Defixiones</i>.  What's a     grave keeper to do, for example, if the site's left unmarked or there's no burial at all?</p>
<p>Yes, Galás' caustic voice is at times overblown, and you won't likely plop these discs into your stereo     after a rough day at the office; like a complex modernist tome, their richly idiosyncratic materiality     demands patient intelligence.  At times, listening to these records is like treading water in the Black     Sea: To experience them fully involves unraveling codes, grabbing after spirits, and immersing yourself     into sinking shadows. It's an effort, but with more and more classifiably ephemeral and easily digestible     sugar blasts erupting in the underground, breaking a sweat now and again with something that feels like     it's been shot straight out of hell provides a nice change of pace.</p></div>"|11750.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11750-defixiones-will-and-testament-la-serpenta-canta/|8.5|Brandon Stosuy

If the <i>2014</i> EP is any indication, they need to
    cut their touring and attempt to write some worthwhile songs to complement those on last year's brilliant
    <i>Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?</i>.  This disc's two new songs, ""2014"" and ""Emasculate the Masculine"",
    offer very little justification for their release, and the EP's two other tracks-- an outtake and a demo--
    shamelessly try to fill out a disc already short on time and ideas.</p><p>
    
    If there's any common ground between these two new songs, it's that both seem strikingly unfinished, and
    far less developed than the band's previous material.  ""2014"" begins promisingly in a whirlwind of catchy
    lo-fi Casiotones and bedroom dancepunk beats, while hushed vocals keep in line with the group's familiar
    morbid tack, wondering if in a decade there will still be ""enough oxygen for me to breathe.""  From here,
    however, The Unicorns attempt to replace the song's existing melody with haphazard textured builds and
    collapses that, in their hastily slapped together state, feel aimless, sloppy, and entirely amateurish.
    A potentially redemptive la-la-la chorus kicks in toward the track's end, but lasts only a few seconds
    before petering out with an abrupt, meandering finish.</p><p>
    
    ""Emasculate the Masculine"" is much more straightforward, but perhaps to a fault.  The song builds around
    bar-band guitar strums that display just enough quirk to recall-- for better or worse-- the similarly
    chicken-wirey outfit Cake.  Rather than stuffing the track with great, fleeting hooks as in the past,
    The Unicorns have decided here to ride a single, simple melody, delivered in an unconvincing whisper.
    Eventually, guitars spin up a perfectly nostalgic <i>Final Fantasy II</i> melody that drives the track
    out, complete with cowbells, a hot synth riff, and a hidden but hooky grumble of noise that proves to be
    the song's poignant last breath.  But again, the potential redemption of this closing segment fails to
    invite enthusiasm like the material on their debut, due to the awkward, slapdash nature of the rest of
    the track.</p><p>
    
    Like ""2014"", <i>Who Will Cut Our Hair</i> outtake ""Evacuate the Vacuous"" opens with potential on a slow,
    sparse lilt and the disc's only real guitar hook, but again, the results are wanting, and why this song
    never made the full-length quickly becomes obvious.  Here, The Unicorns hastily jump through several
    varying dynamics and approaches, but without any of their usual refinement, and even fewer interesting
    ideas.  Even the lyrics-- consider ""Everything's okay in its own little way""-- seem trite and unconsidered.
    (Needless to say: After this run through stale B-sides and outtakes, the inclusion of a demo version of
    the disc's title track seems more than a little pointless.)</p><p>
    
    What's frustrating about all of this, of course, is that The Unicorns, when in the right mindset, are
    capable of drumming up distinctively original and mindblowingly memorable indie pop bliss.  But the lack
    of inspiration on display here may be a result of more than just an off day in the studio: Recently,
    rumors have circulated of infighting between members, and the live shows which they performed with such
    enthusiasm and unrelenting mania last fall have begun to feel somewhat stilted and tense.  Earlier this
    month, the band posted a message to their website after a particularly disastrous show in Montreal,
    stating, ""If we don't take some considerable time off, I think we might all go crazy.""  12 months of
    rigorous touring can put an enormous strain on band relations-- particularly when its core members have
    been pals since their schooldays.  While this is all pure speculation, overexertion and irritability would
    at least offer a plausible excuse for the lack of imagination and effort behind these songs.  Otherwise,
    there just isn't one.</p></div>"|8381.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8381-2014-ep/|3.6|Nick Sylvester

    should find its way through my mail slot but the new Antibalas LP?  Let it be known: the American afrobeat
    awakening is in full effect.  [Much rejoicing ensues.]</p><p>
    
    All year, Fela-inspired ensembles have been rocking dancefloors and picking fights with nervous Republicans
    across the country.  Antibalas, of course, predates them all, having staked their claim to Fela's dynasty
    back in 2001 with their Ninja Tune debut, <i>Liberation Afrobeat Vol. 1</i>.  That release beautifully
    conveyed Fela's bravado and bluster, even while the band was yet unable to evoke his humor, intimacy and
    personality.  Of course, while I was thrilled to hear a new multi-culti spin on the Nigerian afrobeat
    legacy, I couldn't shake my disappointment at the record's lack of focus, or its departure from Fela's
    tried-and-true blueprint.</p><p>
    
    But, never daunted, Antibalas regrouped to drop the bomb the world was waiting for: Their 2002 follow-up
    <i>Talkatif</i> lightened their sound with sharper songwriting, including some truly memorable melodies
    (no mean feat within afrobeat's syncopated firestorm) that popped with addition of bright major chords,
    Afro-Latin rhythms, briefer track lengths, and more compelling lyrical fomentations from Duke Amayo.  Now
    arrives the third installment of the Antibalas handbook for global empowerment, <i>Who Is This America?</i>,
    which, in the midst of the current trickle-up afrobeat revival, has Antibalas bringing a more galvanized
    and urgent righteous noise than ever before, and proving they lead the pack when it comes to the re-imagining
    and recreating of Fela's archetypal artform.</p><p>
    
    If you're familiar with afrobeat, you'll have a basic grasp of this record's sound: Clean, staccato guitars
    and conga 'n' snare breakbeats are quickly avalanched by monstrous horn sections, shakere counter-rhythms,
    and kinky clavinets.  Opener ""Who Is This America Dem Speak Of?"" enters with several minutes of polyrhythmic
    pyrotechnics, before Amayo finally busts in with a scathingly ironic vocal introduction, kicking the album
    into a high gear it never shifts back down from.  At 12 minutes, it's one of the longer tracks in the group's
    repertoire, though a peek at the runtimes reveals that <i>America</i> contains two even lengthier tracks,
    one of which nears the 20-minute mark.  Indeed, where Antibalas' previous works were abridged for accessibility,
    here they've clearly become more comfortable with their staying power, and more confident with their voice.</p><p>
    
    While Fela was a master at submerging political censure under metaphor (see his 1973 release, <i>Gentleman</i>,
    a denouncement of colonialism that employed pants as symbolism), Antibalas is more didactic, though they do
    dabble in some amusing poetics.  Both the opening track and the breakbeat powerhouse ""Big Man"" come down on
    America's wholesaling of capitalist consumerism, augmented by a newfound razor-sharp wit.  That sense of
    humor is also apparent on ""Indictment"", a stylistic watershed for the band.  The track opens with a
    <i>Superfly</i>-echoing riff as spastic tenor sax man Stuart Bogie recites a litany of offenses committed
    by everyone from Donald Rumsfeld to ""the game of baseball,"" in what sounds like some funky <i>People's
    Court</i>.  The terrific throwback production-- cracking, overmiked drums, theme-show guitar, and background
    chatter reminiscent of James Brown's original <i>Live at the Apollo</i>-- make for one of the most unique,
    compelling songs the group has ever laid to tape.</p><p>
    
    The decision to close <i>America</i> with two monumental midtempo songs gives Antibalas the opportunity to
    show off all the tricks and insight they've gained in their seven years together.  Victor Axelrod's liquid
    organ initially takes something of a plodding lead on ""Elephant"", but at six minutes in, the track briefly
    dubs out and Ernesto Abreu's Yoruba vocals come on like a Nuyorican boogaloo crooner.  ""Sister"" is a
    19-minute percussive workout; every instrument-- clavinet, horns, guitar, bass-- is a drum, rising and
    falling through a sexy, hypnotic and occasionally spacey plotline that, even in its extended length, keeps
    a tight, tense grip on the ear.</p><p>
    
    Like hip-hop and reggae, afrobeat is one of the crucial forms of expression for the world's disenfranchised.
    As time passes and we get further from the initial heat of Fela's influence, bands like Antibalas play a
    greater role in keeping the flame lit.  <i>Who Is This America?</i> is the group's most powerful fuel for

<li> Adoration.  Barrett's innocently brilliant psych-folk first set Pink Floyd in motion; when he left
    the band after one record, too erratic from drugs or mental illness to keep up with its growing fame, the
    Floyd lost the bright wit of his songwriting and started its slide to light-show-dominated arena-rock.
    Barrett cut a couple albums as a solo artist before giving up music and retreating from the world, and
    his legacy is colored by his audible struggle to keep it together in the studio.  Hearing this witty,
    charming performer disintegrate in front of you evokes nothing less than the tragic destruction of
    innocence.<p>
<li> Backlash.  Though talented, Barrett influenced more great post-psych songs than he ever wrote himself,
    and he would have gone down as a few-hit wonder if not for his legend, which was built more than anything
    by the melodrama of Pink Floyd.  The band that let him go repeatedly paid him tribute, from the slick
    classic rock touchstone <i>Wish You Were Here</i> to the blood-curdling shrieks on <i>The Wall</i>, where
    ego-maestro Roger Waters tried to have it both ways by imitating Barrett's madness while holding on to his
    own stores of wealth and ass.  Barrett's mythologists have ruined his catalog by combing through every
    line and every mistake for signs of his deterioration, and even that may have been overplayed: While
    Barrett suffered tragically, plenty of artists saw worse fates, including Nick Drake, Phil Ochs, Gary
    Glitter, or heck, Richard Wright, who had to keep working with Waters for a whole 'nother decade.<p>
    
    Wherever you stand on Barrett, his legacy regularly buries everything that was great about his tiny catalog:
    two proper (but shaky) solo records, some outtakes and bootlegs, and these two sessions for the BBC.  The
    supply-and-demand also explains why the 20 minutes of music on <i>The Radio One Sessions</i> will run you
    $20, and why the fans who already own the first half will still buy this for the three new tracks, taken
    from a session that the BBC lost but that someone had taped off the radio, probably on equipment that the
    Germans dropped on them in the war.</p><p>
    
    The album starts with the five tracks from Barrett's 1970 Peel Session, which were already available on a
    separate release.  Joined by David Gilmour on guitar and Humble Pie's Jerry Shirley on bongos, Barrett
    performs a set of his best songs.  The hilarious ""Effervescing Elephant"" sounds more spontaneous, and
    ""Gigolo Aunt"" and ""Baby Lemonade"" are easy-going complements to the studio versions.  But you also get
    ""Two of a Kind"", a song that's so clumsy and devoid of imagery that some critics doubt Barrett even wrote
    it; some blame Richard Wright, but he won't confirm it.</p><p>
    
    The second session, from 1971, includes the <i>Barrett</i> tracks ""Baby Lemonade"", ""Dominoes"" and ""Love
    Song"".  The sound quality of these, unfortunately, is garbled and sub-bootleg, and what's worse, the distant,
    distorted recording plays up the most patronizing stereotypes about Barrett: that you can hear him slip away
    from us, and that the dark recording quality suggests the end of his career.  If you're one of the people
    who gets off on that, you'll wet yourself over the fade-out.</p><p>
    
    But even if this is a lousy value, <i>The Radio One Sessions</i> has one major strength: Barrett.  Listening
    to him strum out these songs with these guys, you can hear everything that's charming about his voice.  It's
    a comfortable session, and Gilmour also shows how much warmer his early, <i>Zabriskie Point</i>-era guitar
    sounded than his later, studio-perfected leads.  Not unlike Pink Floyd's contemporaneous <i>Atom Heart
    Mother</i>, this is engrossingly mellow music, perfect for the heat of late summer and sprawling in a
    meadow.  Once you've gotten your pulse to slow far enough, think about Barrett: Don't dwell on the fame
    that ruined him or the legacy that he ran from, or any other kind of ""big picture.""  Just dig how much fun
    he's having making this music with his friends.</p></li></p></li></p></div>"|569.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/569-radio-one-sessions/|6.3|Chris Dahlen

    it as a creative tool to focus on the micro.  In the digital realm, people have an almost unlimited control
    of detail, and so the microscopic naturally become more important.  In electronic music, where the standards
    of commercial software gently tug sound in the direction of familiar poles, the details are often the only
    way to separate yourself from the bedroom laptop guy down the street.  For one to find their own sound, they
    have to match up a half-dozen sonic parameters that they hope will differ at least slightly from what others
    have done before.</p><p>
    Finland's Pan Sonic is on another trip.  If your average click + cut technician makes music by carefully
    placing drops of sound in the clear pool of stereophonic space, Pan Sonic prefer to crank up the fire hose.
    Descriptions of their live show usually contain the word ""brutal"" and, as with inspiration Throbbing Gristle,
    they're rumored to contain the kind of sub-audible tones the Department of Defense developed for use on the
    battlefield.  Generally eschewing computers in favor of analog tone generators run through a series of
    filters and pedals, Mika Vainio and Ilpo Väisänen do their best to steer raw electrical current toward
    something approaching music.  But hey, no promises.</p><p>
    It's been three years since Pan Sonic's last full-length, a time of touring and side projects, and <i>Kesto</i>
    finds them throwing their hat back into the ring with panache.  <i>Kesto</i> is a 4xCD quadruple album set
    packed in individual slipcases housed in a box that matches the Touch and Rune Gramophone labels in visual
    presentation.  In a time when almost everyone considers CDs too long, lumping four nearly full discs together
    and calling it your new album is self-aggrandizement bordering on clinical mania.  <i>Kesto</i> works, though,
    because Pan Sonic, through intelligent sequencing and a burst of inspiration, are essentially offering four
    separate, complete, and internally consistent albums.  Each disc has its own mood and offers a rounded take
    on a different mix of genres.</p><p>
    CD1 is by far the most aggressive, but also conforms most closely to pop structure.  Three short tracks
    called ""Mayhem"" (all tracks are titled in Finnish with rough English counterparts, and I will cite the
    English versions here) are the viscera that hold the taut flesh of CD1 together.  ""Mayhem I"" is, in my
    mind, the finest album opener in recent memory, a positively inspired and life-affirming blast of horribly
    overdriven chords that somehow congeal into an anthem.  All I can think of when I hear ""Mayhem I"" is Merzbow
    covering Gary Glitter's ""Rock and Roll Pt. 2"".  It's a risky Jock Jam that verges on criminal negligence,
    seemingly designed to further incite a stadium packed with meth-heads.  ""Mayhem II"" has a fast and jerky
    new wave rhythm but is no less generous with its colossal riff, and Pan Sonic have a lot of fun here with
    layering.  When you think the disc can't get any more abrasive, a sudden shriek of white noise arrives to
    push ""Mayhem II"" even further into the red.  The rest of CD1 ranges from a gritty tracks that solder
    industrial shoegaze to breakdancing rhythms (""Fugalforce"") to breath-catching drone interludes.</p><p>
<i>Kesto</i>'s CD2 keeps the short tracks and hooks of CD1 but strips the sound and focuses more on rhythm.
    If CD1 is inspired by the 1970s-- specifically Suicide's take on machine rock (Pan Sonic dedicates CD1's
    ""Diminisher"" to the group), CD2 finds them exploring 80s electro, pitching the normally chilly atmospheric
    temperature of the genre toward absolute zero.  The classic electro syncopation is the driving force, but
    Pan Sonic fill the space in and around the drum hits with sound effects, banging chords, laser beams,
    Dre'd-out Minimoogs, and another dollop of noise.  Though electro is the running theme of CD2, the actual
    mood is quite varied, going from the dispassionate downtempo of ""Arctic"", the perfect soundtrack to a slow
    3 a.m. cruise into the Canyon down Mulholland Drive, to the ruff'n'tuff housequake tubthump of ""Current-Transformer"".
    CD2 winds around but sounds great straight through.</p><p>
    CD3 begins with a low hum that leads to the sound of a toilet flushing, and while the effect is not really
    indicative of the sound to follow, the third disc is indeed the weakest of the lot.  Here is Pan Sonic at
    their most abstract and soundscape-oriented, offering a handful of long tracks that sound like field
    recordings from a secret concrete chamber located beneath a decaying prison-- lots of banging metal echoing
    sharply off of concrete, with disconcertingly large gaps of silence.  ""Corridor"" and ""Appearenceform""
    incorporate unpredictable eruptions of noise interspersed with imperceptible tones.  ""Air"" begins with
    the sound of a hanging garden of live jumper cables sparking wildly on a windy day, and then morphs into
    what sounds like a series of overlapping gongs.  While it is often effectively spooky, CD3 too often feels
    like merely passable dark ambient.</p><p>
    Better is ""Radiation"", the hour-long track that makes up the final disc of <i>Kesto</i>.  The drone rules
    the day here, and Pan Sonic builds the kind of vaguely Eastern future/primitive texture first explored by
    early 70s electronic music like Tangerine Dream.  And believe me, they have <em>plenty</em> of time to explore
    every last nuance of their basic set of sounds.  Does it need to be an hour, you ask?  Well, no, but
    ""Radiation"" seems the kind of track designed to provide a slightly tense atmosphere and can be variously
    tuned in or out over time.</p><p>
    For an album that begins with such a shocking and brief blast of rock power to end with an endless exercise
    in ambience provides a pleasing ying/yang effect.  No four-disc album is lacking dull patches, and <i>Kesto</i>
    is certainly not an exception, but there's <em>a lot</em> of really excellent music here, and you have to
    give Pan Sonic credit for audacity.  This is truly the width and breadth of what they are capable of-- if
    they've ever thought it, it's here-- and it's actually difficult to imagine them ever making another record.
    Where else could they go?</p></div>"|6139.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6139-kesto-234484/|8.2|Mark Richardson

The concept of the extended player is adverse
    to positive results in either of its two incarnations: the fully-realized EP that is developed to display
    a genuine change of direction for an artist, or the EP that bunches together several oddities or remixes
    in a grab for additional spending.  In the case of Danger Mouse and Jemini's newly reissued (and repackaged)
    <i>26 Inch EP</i>, the collection unfortunately leans closer to the latter.</p><p>
    
    The talent is here, although the cast of characters don't seem to have much of interest to say.  Repeated
    verses from The Alkaholiks, as well as Cee-Lo's decision to forgo rapping entirely to sing the chorus of
    ""What U Sittin' on Remix"" are early disappointments, while Sadat X phones in a stilted verse on ""Ghetto Pop
    Life Remix"", continuing the trail of missed opportunities.  Jemini's new verses, too, while strongly delivered,
    are lyrically disappointing: He spends ""The Shit"" praying to the god of self-aggrandization, who is described
    not only as ""the shit,"" but also ""the boss,"" ""a bad motherfucker,"" ""the Incredible Hulk,"" and, on a particularly
    good day, ""the Son of God.""</p><p>
    
    ""Ghetto Pop Life II"" is the disc's strongest remix, giving the anthemic original more of an A.M. radio
    overhaul.  Light string flourishes and subtle keyboard wash over the listener, while Jemini juxtaposes
    quickly spun, low-toned verses with soulful crooning reminiscent of The Pharcyde.  And he kills it, too:
    ""Some might question my openness/ I'm not your average mediocre local vocalist.""  The thing that sets this
    song apart from the others on the EP is the way in which elements of the original remain in the remix,
    while all others are altered beyond recognition.</p><p>
    
    The immediate production standout comes with ""Omega Supreme (DM Remix)"".  Although lacking any new vocal
    treatments from Jemini, Danger Mouse flips the original song on its head by chopping 80s piano-funk with
    ridiculous timing, precisely layering in extra drums for variety, tossing in a two-bar change-up near the
    end of the verses, and otherwise wholly reinventing one of <i>Ghetto Pop Life</i>'s best cuts.  It almost
    singularly makes up for other more disappointing moments over the course of the EP-- a good sign for any
    remix.</p><p>
    
    Viewing the album from the lens of the more involved EP style, <i>26-Inch</i> fails to show any development
    from Jemini, and generally just allows Danger Mouse to experiment with different sounds.  I'm hoping that
    Jemini takes to the topical variety he doled out on the group's preceding full-length, and chills out on
    the singing when he unveils his upcoming <i>Kill Your Heroes</i> LP later this year.</p></div>"|2518.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2518-26-inch-ep/|6.1|Rollie Pemberton

    dirtballs.  Subsequently, listening to their latest record, <i>The Derby Ram</i>, feels a little bit like
    squeezing your eyes shut and chugging a giant mug of swamp water and blindly swallowing your way to a big,
    natural communion.  But before you start conjuring pictures of handmade corduroys and hackeysacks, know
    that The Anomoanon are hardly hosting a gooey, neo-Dead flower fest-- <i>The Derby Ram</i> is overloaded
    with chew-or-be-chewed choices, and it's Ned Oldham's toothy ferocity that makes their jam-wankery so
    telling and immediate, the story of the forest as told by ripping Fenders.  Miraculously, The Anomoanon
    have seized the Dead's scrappy, rollicking prowess, but eschewed their tye-dyed, hide-your-joint-in-your-beard
    meandering: The Anomoanon shoot to kill.</p><p>
    
    For years, rock music has been tethered to one lone, misconstrued apex: the presumably unparalleled magic
    of the late 1960s.  Check every <i>Rolling Stone</i> special issue, cable TV retrospective, and White
    Stripes review (almost all of which overflow with wistful, ""golden age"" laments)-- critics may spit and
    squabble about the technicalities, but most just clench their fists and insist that shit was so, <i>so</i>
    much better 35 years ago.  The Anomoanon may remind us, at least peripherally, of why 1968 has been so
    stupidly puffed up, but their methods are more adventurous than derivative.</p><p>
    
    All of the music on <i>The Derby Ram</i> was written by Oldham (The Anomoanon itself rotates through players,
    although Aran Stith, Jack Carneal and Willy MacLean have all made multiple appearances), but the lyrics here
    are simply credited as ""traditional""-- given 1998's <i>Mother Goose</i>, which recounted the old Mother Goose
    fairy tales, and 1999's <i>A Child's Garden of Verses</i>, based on Robert Louis Stevenson's collection of
    the same name, it's hardly surprising that Oldham has once again shied away from scribbling his own words.
    Still, the traditional lyrics included on <i>The Derby Ram</i> are the perfect compliment to The Anomoanon's
    sprawling, bizarre country-rock, which seems as displaced and poetically nonsensical as the snatches of
    verse it showcases.</p><p>
    
    Each of <i>The Derby Ram</i>'s 12 tracks coalesce effortlessly, perfectly anchored by the eerie (and-- at
    over seven minutes-- epic) title track.  ""Bourbon Whiskey/The Derby Ram"" is a brooding, hellish smear of
    freaked-out psychedelia, kicked off by Oldham's interpretation of ""Rye Whiskey"", a traditional folk cut
    that, incidentally, also appears on Alan Lomax's <i>American Ballads and Folk Songs</i>.  With Ned up front,
    The Anomoanon spew ancient prophecies, as told by squeaky banjoes and throbbing drums.  The resulting song
    is both horrifying and enthralling, a sparse retelling of long-buried secrets.</p><p>
    
    It's awfully easy to hop out of your chair and applaud music that successfully wiggles out of contemporary
    restraints, cracking head-on into the future and fashioning a fresh sonic path.  But it's equally difficult
    to afford the exact same courtesy to bands and records that eschew the present by picking loosely through
    the past.  The Anomoanon make ancient, outmoded sounds, all sprawling, plucky guitar and throaty vocals,
    traditional lyrics and wild, Vietnam-era noodling, but rather than sounding familiar or benign, they're
    brutally anachronistic, proving that, just as a laptop doesn't guarantee innovation, electric guitars can
    still knock everybody down.</p></div>"|204.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/204-the-derby-ram/|8.1|Amanda Petrusich

    cut certain songs from the tracklist.  But <i>On Vacation</i>, the sophomore full-length from San Diego-based
    lo-fi pop group The Robot Ate Me, marks the first occurrence I know of for which the band has made the
    distinction between their worthwhile and subpar tracks so staggeringly clear.  To this curious end, <i>On
    Vacation</i> is spread over two discs: The first indulges all the pretenses for which many people dismiss
    lo-fi indie rock completely: half-baked noodling in the name of experimentation; painfully ironic lyrics
    for songs with titles like ""The Genocide Ball"" and ""I Slept Through the Holocaust"", and loads of novelty
    instrumentation.  In marked contrast, The Robot Ate Me cut the shit on the second disc to offer their best
    songs yet.</p><p>
    
    The band's 2002 debut, <i>They Ate Themselves</i>, was nothing if not promising: The Robot Ate Me consists
    of three clearly intelligent musicians, and as that disc showed, when they take the extra time to structure
    their good ideas and censor their bad ones, their music comes out creative, compelling and often stunningly
    catchy.  With <i>On Vacation</i>'s second disc, they seem to have realized this themselves, crafting songs
    rewarding enough to forgive the first disc's utter tripe entirely.</p><p>
    
    Compare disc one's hissy emo closer, ""On Vacation"", with the second disc's upbeat and clever opener of the
    same name: Drummer Dave Greenberg's jumpy hi-hat swish is pushed way back in the mix, making room for Ryland
    Bouchard's perfectly shaky, bittersweet delivery.  Deadpan lines like, ""Let's go back home to where it's
    familiar/ I can't take this bright burning sun,"" work brilliantly here, stringing out fantastic lyrical/musical
    tension that felt so clumsily and obviously executed on the first disc.</p><p>
    
    ""Apricot Tea"" is the lush sibling track to disc two's ""On Vacation"". Bouchard is still dead-on here, but
    with an even more curious rubato for his introductory remarks: ""If you want to lie at the bottom of the
    Atlantic Ocean, I'll/ Be the one that comes with my ship and be the one that drops the anchor down.""  What
    follows is a thick but wispy vocal chorus of disembodied, wordless harmonizing that forms the waterfall
    backdrop for the song's anthemic line, ""Oh, will you be the one that smiles for me?"", which provides the
    record's biggest and best hook.</p><p>
    
    The album closer, ""I'm Ok"", employs Chris Meng's tasteful banjo accompaniment as the glue for the song's
    many moods, and jumps back and forth through various crosshatchings of Bouchard's simultaneous joy and
    despair in the song's chorus line, ""Hey, I'm all right down here.../ And really, it's ok.""  This is The
    Robot Ate Me's most robust song, and a promising end to an album that so unnecessarily wades through its
    own detritus on disc one to fully showcase itself on disc two.  Maybe there's a point to <i>On Vacation</i>'s
    disparity, or some subtle concept behind it that has to this very sentence remained elusive.  But if there
    isn't one, The Robot Ate Me should feel free to skip the noise and cut straight to their songs next time--
    when they want to be, they're actually quite good.</p></div>"|6805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6805-on-vacation/|7.2|Nick Sylvester

But
    a more fitting cinematic comparison may lie in the noir expressionism of David Lynch's <i>Eraserhead</i>.
    Like that film, <i>Hummer</i> follows a static-headed, haunted protagonist as he struggles with alienation,
    naivety and a disjointed otherworldliness, mirroring Lynch's fondness for subtle humor and shaky delirium.</p><p>
<i>Hummer</i> also betrays the mundanity of its title, challenging you to feel at ease within its seven
    uncomfortable, nagging creations.  If you're familiar with Fog's self-titled debut or last year's <i>Ether
    Teeth</i>, this disc's twisted pop mechanics and freak-show instrumentation may not be so jarring; if you're
    not, Andrew Broder's capricious approach to arrangement and continuity may take some adjusting to.  In either
    case, you should find <i>Hummer</i> as uneven as it is fascinating-- but then, the EP has always been the
    most sensible medium on which artists can spill their temporary departures and outlandish experiments.</p><p>
    
    Fog has never courted cash-register acclaim, but this release seems intent on proving its ""difficult""
    credentials by almost instantly pulling the musical guts out of its fledgling opener, ""Whom That Hits
    Walls"".  Broder does get around to laying down a droning, thumping dirge after a short while, but then
    takes a knife to <i>it</i> as well, before finally allowing the song to limp out in a thrashing tantrum.
    It's a technique that recalls the kind of artsy self-sabotage Sonic Youth employed on <i>Washing Machine</i>'s
    ""The Diamond Sea"", which similarly operated more as an understated glimpse of talent than a cacophony
    designed to mask a deficiency of it.</p><p>
    
    ""I, Baby"" marries the kiddy-speak of Nick Cave's ""All the Pretty Little Horses"" with stark piano and a hushed
    vocal delivery.  Although Broder's decision to tack a 'Y' onto the end of every line (""When I grow uppy/ Me
    get strongy/ Me lifty/ See me strongy"") can be grossly irritating, the damaged vocalizing and awkwardly
    out-of-sync phrasing asks us to see the simple pleas beyond the seemingly gimmicky vehicle.  The track
    clatters out in a pots-and-pans shuffle, stirring a poignant current that flows through the rest of the
    EP.</p><p>
    
    On later tracks, his stream-of-consciousness approach holds up to scrutiny, rarely sounding too indulgent
    or trite.  Although the technique fails to provide a tangible narrative or resolution, songs like ""Melted
    Crayon"" and ""Stink of Kings"" paint an even deeper sense of fragility and foreboding than Broder's usual fare.
    On ""Melted Crayon"", in particular, a strong undercurrent of menace permeates Broder's gentle acoustics: ""I
    must have strange glasses on/ I must have taken strange poison,"" he sings, before perverting the images of
    childhood in lines like, ""Drink melted crayons for me/ Drink every crayon in the box,"" and gurgling to a
    string-swaddled close that hints at a quiet madness.</p><p>
<i>Hummer</i> evades easy classification due to Broder's overambitious nature and general lack of cohesion--
    the disc dips as heavily into leftfield electronics as it does indie pop-- but, wisely eschewing a traditional
    coherence and fully embracing the odd rhythms of his mind, Broder presents an uncompromising vision that
    could have hideously backfired.  The EP's centerpiece, ""Cockeyed Cookie Pusher"", acts as a microcosm for
    the entire EP: It is beautifully sung and deftly arranged, but oh what a silly title.</p></div>"|3131.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3131-hummer-ep/|7.0|Dan Lett

You and I can sit
    here and pretend we're saints and that everything is fine, but in the end, while the message board sinners
    are getting theirs and the bookies who fix the Grammys are in line for theirs, we'll be sweating out that
    time we stole money from the donation jar at the 7-11 and bought the soundtrack to <i>Footloose</i>.  Twice.
    But I'm not one to spend too much time dwelling on the past.  Let bygones be The Bangles-- fifth graders
    need girl singers to have crushes on, too.</p><p>
    However, what might have been common knowledge in 1984-- say, that Hall &amp; Oates were, at best, music my
    parents listened to, and at worst, pretty fucking terrible-- seems to come out much better in the wash.
    I heard Toto in the mall two days ago, and had to fight the urge to proclaim ""Africa"" the best song of
    the 80s.  Okay, bad example, because I even loved that one in grammar school.  But I didn't love H&amp;O;,
    Steely Dan or Michael McDonald (that much).  So, I grew up, and somehow look back on all that stuff
    semi-fondly, like an infected wound a torture victim was forced to live with for four years in captivity.
    Later, he looks at the scar as a companion, the only other being who really knows what went down all those
    years ago.  ""Out of Touch"", you are my beautiful scar.</p><p>
    French quartet Phoenix are either drenched in the same sentimental soul-searching, or, hey, actually <i>like</i>
    soft, 80s-powered MOR pop.  And you know what?  I think I'm with them, for the most part.  Vocalist Thomas
    Mars couldn't break a sweat on the sweatingest day of his life, but when it comes to smoothing out the
    velvet, he's singing second tenor for Green Gartside.  Mars' voice goes down almost too easily on the band's
    second full-length, <i>Alphabetical</i>, which occasionally works against the full-scale pop invasion his
    songs might otherwise deliver.  Adult contemporary hallmarks abound (chimes, ""tasty"" rhythm guitar, midtempo
    rock that sounds like mid-tempo funk), but fortunately for me, so do good melodies and arrangements.  As
    any survivor of the mid-80s eventually discovers, adult contemporary doesn't have to be evil.</p><p>
    Wisely, Phoenix place most of their best material at the head of the album.  The first single, ""Everything
    Is Everything"", is a glorious example of how to write a classically ambiguous soft-pop song: ""Things are
    gonna change/ And not for better/ Don't know what it means to me/ But it's hopeless, hopeless.""  Sounds
    pretty down.  ""What I can't explain/ I'm sure you'll get it well/ Since I always wanted/ I always wanted
    you.""  Okay, who wants what now?  It doesn't matter, because when you factor in the ace acoustic guitar
    jazz chords (yep), itchy triangle and Mars' pleading, cute lil' French guy croon, you realize that life is
    more than good lyrics.  Life is about finding jams with triangles.  Or Moog-squelch bass (""Run Run Run""),
    or grown men holding out falsetto harmonies so long they run out of breath (""I'm an Actor"").</p><p>
    There is necessary filler, too: ""Anybody"" is decent VH1 fare with a hip-hop backing track safe for soccer
    moms, and vocal unison choruses that hearken back to the glory days of Fleetwood Mac.  (You heard me.)
    However, I'd argue that the band's penchant for lite-sounds gets the better of them here, particularly
    in comparison to, say, Justin Timberlake.  ""Señorita"" could be a good short-term goal for Phoenix, but
    on <i>Alphabetical</i>, they're content to settle in a comfortable rut of ultra-suede and Parisian cool.
    ""Holdin' on Together"" psychically channels <i>Private Dancer</i> but forgets it was by Tina Turner; the
    title track threatens to become Sheryl Crow at any moment, but without the preoccupation of being ""rootsy.""
    There's something admirable about a record that proves it's possible to remove grit from adult contemporary
    pop.</p><p>
    Still, it's tough to argue with the overall sheen of the thing.  Just as Mars slips and slides through my
    ears, <i>Alphabetical</i>, like the best 80s jams, does that thing it does and gets out before the stale
    aroma of decay sets in.  It doesn't ask you to remember it in the morning, and even leaves a few calling
    cards to reminisce those special moments in the foyer, gripping a glass of wine and buzzing on the twinkle
    in your eye.  Sounds gross, doesn't it?  You'd be surprised.</p></div>"|6273.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6273-alphabetical/|6.7|Dominique Leone

    the concept record is enjoying a small comeback at the moment.  But perhaps careful not to echo the supposed
    sins of bloat and misbegotten puffery that characterized the psychedelic and progressive rock eras, many of
    the artists responsible for the best recent concept records-- Sufjan Stevens' <i>Greetings from Michigan</i>,
    the Magnetic Fields' <i>i</i>, and The Fiery Furnaces' upcoming <i>Blueberry Boat</i>-- share a willful
    intimacy that borders on the quaint.</p><p>
    On <i>A Grand Don't Come for Free</i>-- the follow-up to his internationally acclaimed debut, <i>Original
    Pirate Material</i>-- Mike Skinner audaciously weaves an 11-track narrative over an often bare and inert
    musical backdrop, one that acts more like a film score than the foundation of a pop record.  The plot is
    pretty bare-bones: boy loses money, boy meets girl, boy loses girl. But by focusing as much on the minutiae
    of life as on its grand gestures, the impact of Skinner's album-- essentially a musical update of ""The
    Parable of the Lost Coin"" peppered with <i>Seinfeld</i>'s quotidian anxiety and, eventually, a philosophical
    examination of Skinner's lifestyle and personal relationships-- transcends its seemingly simple tale.</p><p>
    Cynics and/or detractors could sneer that Skinner's sonics are too slight and that his flow is too rigid--
    particularly when compared to ""other"" hip-hop artists-- without being entirely off the mark: Skinner's
    awkward, sometimes offbeat delivery is even more charmingly/frustratingly clumsy here than it was on
    <i>Original Pirate Material</i>, and the record's beats and melodies are subservient to its story.  But
    while those perceived weaknesses may make <i>A Grand</i> a non-starter for those who disliked Skinner's
    debut, trying to place his square peg into the round holes of either hip-hop or grime/eski seems a mistake.
    After all, this is a record that starts with its protagonist trying to return a DVD and ends with him
    chastising himself for improperly washing his jeans.  In between, he spends time at an Ibiza burger stand,
    smokes spliffs on his girlfriend's couch, grumbles about a broken TV, sorts out his epilepsy pills,
    philosophizes about the nature of friendship, and grumbles about the failures of mobile technology.
    Clearly, Skinner is on a singular place on the pop landscape.</p><p>
    Echoing his ability to compensate for his own musical weaknesses, Skinner manages to turn his character's
    personal shortcomings into <i>A Grand</i>'s strengths: Communication failures, both technological and human,
    allow Skinner to deftly examine body language and small gestures.  His character's lack of prospects and
    disconnect with work and family highlight the importance of friendship (especially, perhaps, to young urban
    adults).  His crippling self-doubt (at the record's start, any hiccup in his day is proof that he should
    just spend it in bed) and need for approval from others makes his solipsistic epiphany all the more
    heart-wrenching.  The album's ultimate contradiction may be that while Skinner's life is seemingly driftless,
    his understandable attempt to tether it to another human being-- <i>any</i> other human being-- often causes
    him more harm than good.</p><p>
    Considering that Skinner showed such a gift for post-laddish humor on <i>Original Pirate Material</i>, the
    most surprising aspect of <i>A Grand</i> may be that, here, he's at his best when he's at his most sentimental.
    His love and/or relationship songs overflow with melancholy and the inability to express emotion at crucial
    moments.  In short, they're pretty truthful and sometimes painfully familiar.  Along with the drug haze of
    ""Blinded by the Lights"", <i>A Grand</i>'s best moments are a pair of tracks that bookend the story's main
    boy/girl relationship: The first-date track ""Could Well Be In"" (""I looked at my watch and realized right
    then that for three hours we been in conversation/ Before she put her phone down, she switched to silent
    and we carried on chatting for more than that again"") and the dissolution of that same relationship on
    ""Dry Your Eyes"", a tongue-tied, heart-in-throat ballet of non-verbal expression.</p><p>
    That Skinner is able to coax so much from a cliché-heavy, 50-minute examination of solipsism and self-pity
    is a tribute to his ability to reflect and illuminate life's detail.  By stressing his paranoia and doubts
    (""It's hard enough to remember my opinions, never mind the reasons for them,"" he blubbers as he loses a
    domestic dispute), he deftly avoids the melodrama of today's network reality TV.  Instead, his approach
    echoes the faux reality of <i>The Office</i> (which shares a non-ending ending with <i>A Grand</i>) and
    the me-first neediness of its ""star"" David Brent (whose final-episode self-actualization echoes Skinner's).
    Like <i>The Office</i>, Skinner's anthropological humanism typically focuses on either the mundane or
    disappointing-- and, let's face it, life is most often one or the other--- but he does so with such
    endearing intimacy and bare honesty that it's easy to give yourself over to the album's narrative on
    first listen and, perhaps just as importantly, to want to revisit it over and over again.</p></div>"|7533.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7533-a-grand-dont-come-for-free/|9.1|Scott Plagenhoef

    as one of hip-hop's most highly regarded turntablist records.  A drum-funk tour-de-force, the record
    continued Def Jux's then-unparalled creative streak, spotlighting Rjd2 as the only hip-hop producer
    since DJ Shadow capable of taking to both long-form rhythmic experiments and 3:30 rap cages with such
    effortless dexterity.</p><p>
    
    But just as seasons lead to new colors and moods, careers lead to new directions, and in two years, things
    have changed dramatically for R.J. Krohn.  <i>Since We Last Spoke</i> is a dizzying taster's choice that
    plays like a broken radio dial, jumping from nostalgic A.M. soul and funk-rock cantinas to tech-house jams
    and retro synth vamps.  Yet, while variety has been inherent in all of Rj's work, the mish-mash of styles
    on display here feels less like a result of intent than of indecision, and as a result, these sudden 180s
    tend to cut into the record's cohesiveness.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, Rjd2's picked up a wealth of new tricks since <i>Dead Ringer</i> to compensate for the
    unexpected stylistic transformation: <i>Since We Last Spoke</i> is packed with crashing silences and
    false senses of security, radical mutations of <i>Dead Ringer</i>'s gritty electronic textures, and an
    overall darker tone that conjures rusted bridge girders, fractured kaleidoscopes, and smog-shrouded sunsets.
    ""Making Days Longer"" in particular breeds success, opening with the light pluck of oriental strings as a
    cavern opens to reveal a double helix of <i>Metroid</i>-evoking synth lines.  Here, framed by reverberating
    analog lines and an aorta drum pulse, Krohn sweetly dictates the greatest telephone jingle never made:
    ""Strange how a phone call can change your day, take you away/ Away from the feeling of being alone/ That's
    the telephone.""</p><p>
    
    For a guy who's been shadowed by a certain comparison throughout his relatively brief career, it's ironic
    that his sophomore slump, while never as problematic, so closely mirrors that of Josh Davis.  Many of the
    missteps of Shadow's <i>The Private Press</i> are repeated here, as Rj shirks rapping and scratching
    in lieu of synths, and discovers the gentle strength of the indie rock vocal.  On ""1976"", Krohn dons a
    leisure suit and bongos out his own copa-cobanger while subtle Moog helicopter drones, machine-gun horns,
    and car-chase bass spin a tale that might've felt more at home soundtracking <i>Magnum P.I.</i>
    than serving as the showcase cut from his latest LP.</p><p>
    
    Rjd2 does return to his strengths on occasion here: ""To All of You"" is a soft-focus blaxploitation
    love theme recalling Isaac Hayes' <i>Shaft</i> mood-setting; ""One Day"" mellows out with gently pressed
    piano chords and dusky synthtones punctuated by a muted kickdrum and handclap-inflected snare hits; ""Exotic
    Talk"" jumps between a reworking of his fiery <i>Urban Renewal Program</i> contribution ""True Confessions""
    and tense dropouts dripping with wah-wah'd clavinet.  Still, <i>Since We Last Spoke</i> is something of a
    checker game: For every track like ""Someone's Second Kiss"", portraying the emotional severity of an android
    funeral dirge, there's another in which Rj throws back to the worst of the 1980s with a cheesy, guitar-centric
    pop/rocker like ""Through the Walls"".</p><p>
    
    Over the course of <i>Since We Last Spoke</i>, Rjd2 experiments with indie rock, IDM, metal, Italo-disco,
    downtempo, and 80s R&amp;B.;  Unfortunately, few of these tracks wield the same impact as his tried-and-true
    hip-hop productions, and more often than not, feel like attempts at being everything to everyone.  At the
    end of ""To All of You"", there's a minute-long stretch of rugged blues boom-bap and a scratched vocal
    repeating, ""Play that beat.""  If only Rjd2 had heeded that advice.</p></div>"|6798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6798-since-we-last-spoke/|7.0|Rollie Pemberton

    had a star turn in repurposing <i>Californication</i> and <i>By the Way</i> as wise, unwanky meditations
    on the mellow gold of life after hedonism.  Parts of <i>Shadows Collide with People</i> align nicely with
    those records, both sonically and thematically, but the album is really an exercise in focusing, for
    Frusciante to ground his self-made stuff in the same resignation and emotion that makes the Chili Peppers'
    latter period more resonant than, say, ""Magic Johnson"".  For <i>Shadows</i>, Frusciante has finally harnessed
    the energy and unqualified honesty that pulsed underneath the wandering Syd Barrett-ness of his weird work,
    and applied them to a reedy, vaguely psychedelic, and consistently melodic collection of songs.  Heaven,
    pain, swirl, death, time, belief: on <i>Shadows Collide with People</i>, these are the splotches of color
    that burst most before his retinas.</p><p>
    
    He probably never was, but <i>Shadows</i> proves Frusciante's unconcern with upholding his oft-referenced
    stature as The Most Awesomest Guitarist of His Generation, or whatever.  Yeah, yeah, there are electric
    guitars here-- the fame rumination ""Second Walk"" ends with a great solo full of fuzzy tone and bent notes
    to crack Carlos Santana's skull-- but mostly, Frusciante and principal collaborator Josh Klinghoffer
    (of Bicycle Thief) indulge in the tricks and tracks of a full-fledged studio, building sparkly platforms
    for mercurial thoughts and snatches of meaning from whatever instruments and styles seem right in the
    moment.</p><p>
    
    ""Carvel"" opens <i>Shadows</i> with punch, crosshatching urgent, bass-heavy modern rock with a brittle sort
    of psychedelia that becomes elemental to the record.  ""Sending a dummy to my God,"" a newly vocally confident
    Frusciante sings over filtered synthesizers-- and then everything's brought back for a triumphant rock
    finish.  ""Omission"" is a cousin to ""Californication"", its dry acoustic guitar getting help from processed
    electronics and what might be a mellotron.  Frusciante's groggy yorn also melds nicely with Josh Klinghoffer's
    breezy falsetto.</p><p>
    
    This record is actually filled with all manner of keys and electronic freakery, particularly on brooding
    instrumental pieces like ""Failure33Object"" or ""-00Ghost27"", but the rambling garage-rock of ""This Cold"" or
    the aforementioned ""Second Walk"" seems like an equally comfortable workspace.  Not surprisingly, Frusciante
    also drifts regularly into the echoing astral stardust-- ""The Slaughter"" and ""In Relief"" both zig on cool
    comet's tails of bittersweet detachment: ""I was afraid to be me,"" he says on the latter.  ""Be anything you
    want to be.""</p><p>
<i>Shadows Collide with People</i>, like all of Frusciante's earlier solo experiments, revels in self-indulgence.
    It's a steady flow of introspection and bent-light reflection.  However, with a newfound attention to melody
    and structure, his hemming and hawing about life, death, and fluorescent guts comes into focus for the rest
    of us.  In a previous time, a track called ""Regret"", with the only lyric being ""I regret my past/ Stay alone,""
    might have been the darkly bruised heart of a destructive, impenetrable sonic diary.  Not so in these new
    shadows.  Here, shimmering over a tapestry of orchestral programming, Frusciante's voice cracks and yearns
    between processed splutters and reverb.  Of course, he regrets his past-- he has, after all, come close to
    death on more than one occasion-- but in ""Regret""'s quietly surging melody, his own heartrending singing,
    and the overall warmth of <i>Shadows Collide with People</i>, what Frusciante's saying has never been more
    clear.</p></div>"|3233.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3233-shadows-collide-with-people/|6.9|Johnny Loftus

Simultaneously the most naively underrated and clumsily misused tool in all music
    (besides maybe the euphonium), it inhabits a special place in every musician's heart.  It's where many of
    us laid our first bedroom opuses to tape, songs unmolested by Audio Units Parametric EQ'ing or other
    digital affectations.  It's also a device that many (wrongly) associate with bad songs: Just because lots
    of musicians start writing and recording using it doesn't mean an artist can't one day commit his best
    material to a hissing C90.  It's simply that, after a while, most songwriters choose to upgrade to better
    equipment, for the obvious advantages, leaving the four-track in the realm of embarrassing memories from
    one's humble beginnings in the craft.</p><p>
    
    Ever mysterious and difficult to categorize, Frog Eyes have endeavored to deliver their songs back to the
    close-mic'd uteri on <i>Ego Scriptor</i>, a diminutive limited-press collection of 11 acoustic performances
    from the band's existing repertoire.  Though many of the songs rendered on <i>Ego Scriptor</i> already had
    a distinctly lo-fi feel, they were buttressed by crystalline guitars and compressed drums-- nothing
    over-the-top for studio work, but polished nevertheless.  On <i>Ego Scriptor</i>, those songs come
    unchained, losing their amplified baggage and morphing into vastly different creatures.</p><p>
    
    Here, the band's bizarre, cockeyed song structures and Carey Mercer's sallow, serpentine vocals are lent
    heightened amorphousness by the austere musical backing.  Not only are these songs stripped down in
    production, they're also uniformly limited to one or two verses.  Of the 11 tracks, the longest, ""Sound
    Travels from the Snow to the Dark"", clocks in just shy of three minutes, while the album itself blows by
    in a scant 24.  However, such brevity brings a sense of immediacy to the music, exaggerating the band's
    already abundant idiosyncrasies.</p><p>
    
    The songs on <i>Ego Scriptor</i> range from intensely moving to intensely weird, poles Frog Eyes are no
    stranger to exploring.  ""A Latex Ice Age"" opens the disc in the groggy amniotic fluid of a rainy Sunday
    morning, featuring Mercer's gruff, formless lyrics over a gently plucked acoustic guitar.  ""Bells in the
    Crooked Port"" follows, impeding the sullen tone with more oblique, fairytale-esque verses and the album's
    most ineffaceable melody.  Nowhere on <i>Ego Scriptor</i> is Mercer's voice more unsettling than here,
    especially when he moans, ""I need matrimony like a captain need's his pony.""</p><p>
    
    Perhaps most instantly recognizable of any number, though, is ""One in Six Children Will Flee in Boats"", a
    standout from last year's <i>The Golden River</i>. In acousticized guise, Mercer recreates his vocal
    delivery almost verbatim over a simplistic strum, but the result is no less affecting.  On the flipside,
    ""Sound Travels from the Snow to the Dark"" is nothing like its original, and hardly resembles a traditional
    song at all, winding through non-repetitive verses over a seemingly improvised guitar line.</p><p>
    
    As with all Frog Eyes releases, Carey Mercer's bewildering voice steals the spotlight.  I'm hard-pressed
    to think of anyone who so fully epitomizes the notion of the voice as an instrument.  Mercer is a virtuoso
    of the human ability to make noise, and <i>Ego Scriptor</i> limns his talent in a harsh but honest light.
    My only complaint is that the songs are texturally limited, but that's to be expected from an acoustic
    album.  The four-track is still an underrated tool, and Frog Eyes have used it keenly to produce a
    beautifully and often challengingly intimate album that fully capitalizes upon its possibilities.</p></div>"|3266.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3266-ego-scriptor/|7.7|Sam Ubl

    sounded anonymous next to other much-hyped Swedish groups: The band lacked the idealistically retro politics
    of The (International) Noise Conspiracy, the delinquent nostalgia of The Raveonettes, the hippie-hobbitness
    of Soundtrack of Our Lives, and The Hives' ambitions for global domination-- not to mention their matching
    suits.  The vaguely politicized punk of <i>Black City</i> certainly possessed ferocity and intensity, but
    toward no immediately apparent end.  It wasn't that Division of Laura Lee didn't have a gimmick (which is
    certainly not required), but that they hadn't developed a collective identity-- or, if they had, they didn't
    seem to know how to convey it through music.</p><p>
    On their follow-up, <i>Das Not Compute</i>, that skittishness is gone.  By mixing the Detroit punk they
    claim as a defining influence with decidedly British-sounding elements, the band have carved a niche for
    themselves somewhere between motor city punk and grandiose production.  This is neither an original nor
    a safe move, but it's definitely an upgrade, and to their credit, Division of Laura Lee aren't as interested
    in sweeping, soaring art-rock as in capturing a more aggressive, dirty sound; the elements they borrow from
    contemporary, effects-laden indie rock merely add artillery to their attack.</p><p>
    A sculpted onslaught of stylized static, ghostly keyboards, and minor-key guitars highlight propulsive
    tracks like the opener, ""Does Compute"", and especially ""Endless Factories"", whose signature guitar line
    bridges the gap between <i>The Bends</i> and New Order.  The surprisingly tender ""Breathe Breathe"" and
    ""To the Other Side"" (about the differences between Eastern and Western Europe) are quietly anthemic
    not-quite-ballads whose nearest kin might be Snow Patrol's ""Run"" or Coldplay's ""In My Place"".  And the
    final track, ""There's a Last Time for Everything"", ends the album on an epic note and brings the band
    full circle-- thematically, at least-- to their debut EP, <i>There's a First Time for Everything</i>.</p><p>
    These newer influences ebb and flow throughout <i>Das Not Compute</i>, completely defining a song like
    ""Endless Factories"" while notably absent from the more streamlined tracks like ""Sneaking Up on Mr. Prez"".
    But the album proves consistent enough to cohere into a clear sonic statement, which has refocused Division
    of Laura Lee's songwriting, both structurally and lyrically.  The band have learned to sharpen their hooks
    to gouge deep into the skin, making songs like ""Does Compute"" and ""Dirty Love"" sound simultaneously distinct,
    yet part of a larger whole.</p><p>
    Lyrically, <i>Das Not Compute</i> isn't nearly so consistent.  Singer Per Stålberg crafts several awkward
    lines that don't seem to have translated very well, such as ""Give me back my wisdom"" from ""Does Compute""--
    although the barreling momentum and the infectiousness of the chorus make that line barely noticeable.  On
    the other hand, ""Dirty Love"", which features The Cardigans' Nina Persson, hinges on a particularly poetic
    chorus: ""I hate to see you blocking all the exits/ Turning into ghosts/ What can I do to get you on the
    dance floor?""  Division of Laura Lee realize they aren't going to cure listener ennui, but they at least
    give the crowd a beat to dance to.  And later in the song, when Stålberg asks, ""What can I do to get you
    off the dance floor,"" it's unclear whether he's trying to bring the house down or foment a political
    movement.</p><p>
    Or, perhaps, both: For Division of Laura Lee-- as for their former Burning Heart cohorts (International)
    Noise Conspiracy-- politics and music are so closely twined as to be practically indistinguishable.  By
    combining American punk, British art-rock, and Swedish smarts to beef up their already muscular sound,
    they've not only developed a distinctive sonic personality on <i>Das Not Compute</i>, but they've developed
    a pose into a stance.</p></div>"|2344.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2344-das-not-compute/|7.6|Stephen M. Deusner

It's small on
    your screen, perhaps difficult to see in that tiny representation of the sepiatone album cover photo, but
    Charlemagne's sole operator, one Carl Johns, sports, in addition to antlers, a perfect handlebar, waxed up
    into sinister hooks flanking his nose and conferring order upon his bedhead.</p><p>
    
    So, congratulations, Charlemagne, your record is guaranteed a solid rating of 1.0, regardless of its content.
    Thankfully, there's enough quality content encoded on the disc behind the moustache and its constituent face
    to render a rating that low unfathomable.  Rather, Charlemagne's debut (Johns also has three albums out with
    his left-field country project NoahJohn-- Charlemagne appears to be his pop outlet) is a fine one-man-band
    effort bursting at the seams with glowing harmonies and spry pop that suggests a more caffeinated Kingsbury
    Manx.</p><p>
    
    Johns' impressive texture of subtle, chiming synth, acoustic guitar and downplayed drums reaches apotheosis
    on ""Holland Daisy"", opening with a whistled melody and proceeding through a catchy verse to a prechorus that
    actually outdoes the chorus itself with its serpentine melodic twists.  ""How Could He?"" is nearly as good,
    buoyed by a brilliantly simple bassline and a modest guitar solo, the vocals billowing in big, pillowy clouds
    of honeyed harmony.</p><p>
    
    Though the record never quite reaches the high of these two songs again, the rest of the album is solid
    nonetheless: Slower numbers like ""Autumn Evenings"" and the watery epic ""Portrait with No Shortage of
    History""-- the latter a poem by Tenaya Darlington set to music by Johns-- unveil expertly crafted melodies
    over spare backing featuring puttering programmed percussion, electric piano and droning organs.  Johns
    uses a limited tonal palette to achieve numerous effects over the course of the album, blanketing ""Prisoner
    Of..."" in a shroud of melancholy with the same ingredients that make ""How Could He?"" and ""Dawn Upon""
    unmitigated blasts of sunshine.</p><p>
    
    Of course, that limited tonal palette also means that the album as a whole is somewhat monochromatic, which
    is really the chief failing of <i>Charlemagne</i>.  With all those too-genetically-perfect Carolingian
    harmonies slathered all over everything, it's easy for things to blur a bit, no matter how airtight the
    melodies are.  Still, Johns has put together an engaging record all by his lonesome, which isn't terribly
    common in the realm of singer/songwriters.</p></div>"|1761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1761-charlemagne/|7.2|Joe Tangari

    Beat"", Wiley made himself the pirate radio vanguard of his scene, founded the genre's dominant group Roll
    Deep Crew, and affiliated himself with Dizzee Rascal, the hottest blue-chipper in the game.  Now, on his
    solo debut, he attempts to bring one of the British urban landscape's few legitimate youth beats to a
    wider international audience.</p><p>
    
    But before we go any further, let's establish something: Wiley is not Dizzee, and those who approach this
    record expecting highwire vocal acrobatics and dirt-merchant bass/synth blasts will likely be caught off
    guard by Wiley's more pop-orientated approach and comparative stability.  Additionally, while both artists
    hail from the same crew, their methods of dealing with problem are markedly different: Wiley seems to feel
    remorse for his days as a young gunslinger on E3, while Dizzee still appears perfectly content to take out
    those who oppose him, despite his distinct comprehension of society's ills.  Wiley's music also falls closer
    to a straight amalgam of rap and dancehall than Dizzee's icy curveball beats and synth stabs, dictating his
    verses with crystal clarity while riding a bouncy, repetitious style that complements his undulating basslines.</p><p>
    
    ""Goin' Mad"" shows the Eski Boy in top form, taking to schizophrenic self-help over tetherball ragga bass
    and rubber duck sounds.  Here, he relates money as a gateway to insanity (""Money is paper, how could paper
    be evil?/ It must be people, doing those evil things with money/ But you'll go mad""), coaxes himself from a
    bout of crippling apathy (""Pick... yourself... up/ Get up, stand up/ Dust... myself... off/ Realize I'
    m someone/ Yeah, yeah""), and triumphantly regains his stability.  ""Reason"" stands out as well, with one of
    <i>Thin Ice</i>'s most explosive and technical beats.  Wiley once again shirks snares, dressing his kickdrums
    with top hi-hats and handclaps before sailing into a typhoon of mercurial synth bass.  Lyrically, he attempts
    to reconcile with both former love interests (""I'm real, I wouldn't do anything directly at you/ Come on, this
    is me we're talkin' about"") and rival crews (""I know you hate me 'cause you think I write lyrics/ And I aim
    them at your crew/ Come on, blood, that's not true"").</p><p>
    
    Much of the grime scene's draw can be traced to its unusual production, and Wiley's solo inauguration is no
    exception.  Whether taking a rusty cleaver to an SWV track (""Special Girl""), leaving a synth bird loosely
    caged in a blizzard (""Treddin' on Thin Ice"") or conducting a robotic version of Fat Albert's Junkyard Gang
    (""Wot Do U Call It?""), Wiley proves an incredibly technical street professional that's only now hitting his
    stride.  Although his beats do tend to err a bit on the repetitive side (there are a few sounds in particular
    he seems quite fond of), subtle and intriguing variations quickly distinguish themselves with repeated
    listens.  I could probably have done without <i>Thin Ice</i>'s various instrumental interludes, and would
    have enjoyed more topical and lyrical diversity, but ultimately, Wiley's snapshot of London's ghettos proves
    worth the trip across the pond.</p></div>"|8775.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8775-treddin-on-thin-ice/|7.6|Rollie Pemberton

    nauseatingly smug, yelped out in smarmy, supercilious prose?  Or is David Cross just a giant fucking
    asshole?</p><p>
    
    That Cross is such an immensely unlikable live performer-- condescending, defensive, arrogant, patronizing--
    is both his greatest asset and his most crippling flaw, and it's that conflict-of-interest that makes him
    such a polarizing (and compelling) comic.  Ultimately, Cross has somehow manipulated self-satisfaction,
    the least funny of all post-collegiate states, into a perfectly valid comedic persona, leaving it up to
    his audience to sort out their guffaws from their grimaces.  And there are always plenty of both.</p><p>
    
    Having signed a contract with Sub Pop, liner-note-repped for The Fiery Furnaces, stunt-reviewed for
    <i>Rolling Stone</i> and <i>Spin</i>, toured with rock bands, publicly mocked Staind/Evanescence/Scott
    Stapp, and acquired a perfect pair of black, plastic-framed glasses, David Cross has inadvertently
    embedded himself in the contemporary indie scene, amassing wads of useless cred and granting hipsters
    even more reasons to be annoyingly sarcastic over cans of PBR.  <i>It's Not Funny</i> conceals bits of
    comic gold (on fresh fathers who complain about the trials of paternity: ""Try talking your girlfriend
    into her third consecutive abortion.  That takes finesse!  You're just inconvenienced""), but Cross'
    onstage persona, unlike the genius of <i>Mr. Show</i>, is also stupidly tiring, all balls-swinging
    swagger and brainy pseudo-superiority.</p><p>
    
    Recorded in January at Washington, D.C.'s The Improv, <i>It's Not Funny</i> (oh, and the knee-jerk critical
    reaction to pre-emptive album titles?  It's not funny) sees Cross faced with a responsive-if-feisty crowd.
    As with 2003's <i>Let America Laugh</i>, Cross approaches all hecklers with genuine, undisguised disgust.
    When Cross is questioned on a bit in which he glibly suggests that dogs are smarter than women, he
    pauses briefly to ask, ""You don't believe it?  You believe that I didn't do a series of tests?  You're
    right to not believe it, because I'm gonna go ahead and admit that I do not believe what I just said.
    It is what is described as 'a joke.'""</p><p>
    
    Cross' material has been progressively skewing towards the political, and, for better or worse, the
    post-9/11, where-we-are-now theme persists throughout most of <i>It's Not Funny</i>.  Some of Cross'
    terror-talk is supremely well-played, but a lot of his material also seems tired and curiously dated,
    particularly since <i>It's Not Funny</i> was only recorded four months ago.  Cross' fuck-off snarkiness
    may be a welcome antidote to the nauseatingly maudlin faux-sincerity perpetuated by men in public office,
    but is it still clever to snicker about the futility of the color-coded terror system?  Everyone already
    gets that announcing an ""Orange Alert"" is stupid.  Same goes for the call to secure duct tape and plastic
    sheeting from your local Home Depot.  36 episodes of <i>Saturday Night Live</i> later: Um, hee-haw.</p><p>
    
    Cross, like most Americans, remembers how, in the weeks following 9/11, a big, throbbing wave of convoluted
    friend-of-friend free-associating plowed through the U.S.  Everyone immediately removed from the explicit
    devastation of Ground Zero struggled for the appropriate entranceway into earnest empathy, noting second
    cousins in Hoboken or that friend whose plane got re-routed through Ft. Lauderdale.  In some ways, that
    kind of blind, desperate grasping was perfectly understandable-- curling your fingers around one lone
    tragedy (or near-tragedy) is a lot easier to swallow than attempting to reconcile yourself to a gaping
    and anonymous mass grave.  Still, many New Yorkers (in impeccable New Yorker form) found America's
    faux-brotherhood annoying, scowling disgustedly from behind their paper surgical masks, rolling their
    eyes, and snorting at sobbing newscasters in Phoenix.  The behavior of both sides has already been
    well-explored, but Cross still opts to launch into a half-cooked skit about how employees of Vegas' New
    York New York casino may have ""felt it a little deeper.""</p><p>
    
    Cross successfully lands some giggly barbs (riffing caustically about the sobbing overweight woman in
    Accounts Receivable, with a ""Hunky Fireman"" calendar and stack of <i>Dilbert</i> cartoons), but his
    over-indignant NYC pride/national irritation still reeks of Georgian transplantation.  Subsequently, it's
    hard to find his defensive posturing funny: Cross may be joking, but it's still clear that he wants to own
    the tragedy of 9/11, like all New Yorkers who spent hours re-routing their morning commutes or trying to
    forget the sound of a plane crashing into a building full of people.  The problem is that his
    plea-for-possession-masquerading-as-a-joke ends up being far too self-serious to be even a little bit
    laughable.</p><p>
    
    Still, in the end, it's impossible not to appreciate Cross' political tirades, particularly since precious
    few independent artists seem to have the balls/gumption/awareness to tackle what is easily the most salient
    and divisive conflict of the new millennium so far.  Comedy has always been politically brazen where music
    is meek, and Cross is unrelenting: His high-speed, Michael Moore-ish indictment of the Bush administration's
    manipulation of public fear is both convincing and entertaining, while his whispered mockery of Bush's
    misappropriation of ""freedom"" and ""liberty"" elicits loads of knowing sniggers.</p><p>
    
    Anti-war proselytizing aside, Cross lobs plenty of other, equally legitimate (if disappointingly predictable)
    darts at the hypocrisies of the American government, and at the general idiocy of Creationists, racists,
    homophobes, Republicans, people with children, Trent Lott and Strom Thurmond, electric scissors, fundamentalist
    Christians, the rich, and Fox News.  It is, for the most part, standard white liberal disdain-- but sometimes
    funnier, and with lots more cursing.</p></div>"|1676.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1676-its-not-funny/|6.5|Amanda Petrusich

This isn't the first     time I've suspected that Japanese minimal improvisation was pulling chief inspiration from the ""outside""--     think the color of horizons and sound of wind on a contact mic-- but here, I was confronted with what seemed     like obvious references to nature.  And you really have to be careful with stuff like that, because looking     for literal translations in something so at the mercy of not only chance, but also rampant subjective interpretation     on behalf of the musicians and the rest of us, usually ends up short-changing the sounds at hand.  Improvised     performance isn't bound to a concept in the way that more traditional ambient music can be; yet, the music     on this set clings to natural impressions like a portrait.</p>
<p>Sachiko M, Toshimaru Nakamura and Yoshihide Otomo need no introduction to anyone following electro-acoustic     improv (""EAI""), and specifically Tokyo's Onkyo scene; they're the three most celebrated proponents of     minimal electronic improvisation in Japan.  Through many releases and performances since the mid-90s,     these musicians have contributed to a kind of music that simply didn't exist before them.  However, since     Onkyo hasn't really translated well to more rock-centric circles (in the same ways that, say, Merzbow does),     I'm not expecting all of you to share the anticipation I had for <i>Good Morning Good Night</i>, a two-disc     set marking the first time they've released music as a trio.  Yet, unlike Merzbow, this music will hardly     clear rooms, and given its apparent relationship to the organic world, it could very well hit the spot for     many folks not ordinarily down with the whole crazy-freak-noise thing.</p>
<p>Beginning with ""Good Morning"", the set seems to detail the cycle of a day, following with ""Good Afternoon"",     ""Good Evening"" and ""Good Night""-- and like most mornings, it begins hesitantly before waking into a flutter     of activity.  No instrumental credits are listed, but I can guess that it's Sachiko's sine crawling from     beneath Otomo's scratchy turntable several minutes into the piece.  The first segment of the piece seemed     to signify only hints of movement underneath a horizon, and after a resulting clamor, Sachiko's ""voice"" is     like the initiation of the normal morning routine.  Vinyl scratch eases its way back in, like dozens of     slightly annoying tasks the outside world takes for granted, and just before shutting down momentarily,     the sine raises its pitch in protest.  The piece is like a topological diagram of a.m. activity, not so     much depicting the pace of one person, but the scheme of a whole city tracked by a particularly perceptive     satellite.</p>
<p>To my ears, <i>Good Morning Good Night</i> is sparser than other outings featuring the same musicians     (Filament, Cosmos, Nakamura's solo work).  ""Good Evening"" might well be an interesting diagram of a     community winding down, but it's a decidedly tranquil one.  Again, I wonder if linking this music to     specific scenes (much less the titles) is for the best, as moments suggest more individual activity than     meta.  Sachiko's sampler has a brief, fragmented volley with Otomo's turntable, moderated by the sine     from Nakamura's no-input mixing board; I'm hard pressed to read much into it, but it's one of the cooler     moments on the set.  Likewise, during ""Good Night"", after having occupied most of the piece using extended     bass and sine tones, the trio suddenly engages in relatively tense, static-ridden dissonance.  It's an     enigmatic way to end the piece if they were going for a programmatic depiction of late-night, but a     pretty cool way shake things up otherwise.  Even if I wouldn't recommend that Onkyo neophytes start here,     there's still plenty to hear for fans and satellite surveyors alike.</p></div>"|5585.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5585-good-morning-good-night/|7.3|Dominique Leone

In 25 years as a band, writing songs on such blithe yet cosmically related
    topics as girls, television and spicy food, the Descendents have been called a lot of things, and serious
    isn't one of them.  On the other hand, ten albums and a best-of collection is a pretty serious output,
    regardless of the band's sometimes trifling subject matter.  And though they've always affected an
    irreverent, lighthearted persona, the Descendents have written more than a handful of seriously great
    songs.  Ever battling a self-styled ""war against mediocrity,"" the band have witnessed the relentless
    ebb and flow of countless cultural trends, and on <i>Cool to Be You</i>, their first album in eight years,
    they continue to resist deviation from a sound they helped bring to the fore in the early 1980s.</p><p>
    
    After spending most of their first two decades on SST, the band moved to Epitaph in 1996 to release
    <i>Everything Sucks</i>, a wontedly transient collection of pop/punk nuggets, many of which saw immediate
    induction into the Descendents pantheon.  ""Coffee Mug"" was a memorable, if paltry, punk seizure that beat
    Michael Johnson in his best 400 meters, and more importantly, kept pace with other classic sprints in the
    band's catalog.  But following that effort, frontman and cover art muse Milo Auckerman returned to his
    on-again, off-again career as a chemist, effectively putting the Descendents on the backburner.</p><p>
    
    So behold the fruits of eight years' relentless experimentation-- that is, <i>real</i> experimentation, in
    an actual biochemical laboratory.  Though it appears Auckerman's day job has finally earned him the bankroll
    to support a new pair of horned-rims, the Descendents have emerged as their same old selves.  During their
    downtime, members Karl Alvarez, Stephen Egerton and ex-Black Flag drummer Bill Stevenson managed to release
    three studio albums as the wacky but inessential spin-off All, and while that band has never pulled the
    critical weight of the Descendents, it seems to have kept them sharp technically-- now reunited on Fat
    Wreck Chords, the group seems strong as ever, thrashing as always in the name of food and flatulence.  Case
    in point: ""Blast Off"", a song that attempts to reconcile both interests with lyrics like, ""Stay away from
    the chili verde/ Unless you want to get blown away,"" and, ""Capsaicinoids are a thing to avoid/ Unless you
    want to burn in that 'roid.""</p><p>
    
    While maturity may not have gained any import to the band in their time off, they remain as good for a hook
    as they were 20 years yore.  ""Talking"" is the most anthemic of the <i>Cool to Be You</i> lot, featuring a
    winsome guitar melody, a giddy bassline, and Auckerman's typically pining verses.  ""Nothing with You""
    revels in their signature braindead juvenilia, and its music is pleasantly complementary.  Meanwhile, on
    ""Dreams"", Milo affirms his reputation as an inwardly self-loathing nerd, spitting cynical, clever salvos
    like, ""Why do I get my hopes up at all?/ I've been living this Walter Mitty life for too long."" The song
    represents <i>Cool to Be You</i>'s fiercest moment, and though it lacks pubescent humor, it would feel
    right at home amongst the band's 80s arsenal.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, the band waxes serious: On EP-carryover ""'Merican"", they step outside their teenage matrix and
    reach for relevance.  The result, however, betrays the tongue-in-cheek introspectiveness that won the band
    the bulk of their adoration, and its lyrics about American arrogance and double standards not only lack the
    dumb fun of the rest of the record, but are also disconcertingly trite.  Luckily, ""One More Day"" and ""Maddie""
    are redeemingly heartfelt and riff-laden, while the album closer, ""Dry Spell"", catchily (if needlessly)
    reiterates the point.  Its speedy final chorus seems somewhat anticlimactic-- but somehow, it seems humbly
    appropriate: Rather than forcing an ostentatious grand finale, the Descendents unassumingly steal away,
    leaving their legacy fully intact.</p></div>"|2547.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2547-cool-to-be-you/|7.1|Sam Ubl

    electronic artist Marc Nguyen Tan.  The album has recently found its way into more than a few blue-and-orange
    Other Music bags, which, given its influences, is no real surprise: The album recalls everyone from Can and
    Joy Division to Tan's fellow countrymen Air and Serge Gainsbourg-- all names commonly dropped in reference
    to records with at least a week's worth of faded black jeans cred.  Add to this a companion DVD of music
    videos (Colder is first and foremost a video artist) and the fact that the album is currently available
    only on import, and <i>Again</i> becomes the embroidered, double-button collared shirt of taste-made 2003
    releases.</p><p>
    
    Which is maybe part of why I was so hesitant to come to a conclusion on it.  At the moment, its sound is
    at the height of chic, the perfect late-night complement to an evening of jealous lovers and Le Tigre
    remixes.  To this effect, the beat-driven album is neither ambient wallpaper nor sweaty loveromp-- if
    anything, it's an enticing after-shower cigarette that, with any interest in the current musical climate,
    one can't help but smoke.  Stylistically, though, the album (especially the first half) complements
    its uptempo brethren almost too perfectly, and at the expense of substantial songs.</p><p>
    
    Each of Colder's nine tracks is expertly stylized with the rubbery dub and dark groove primacy this year
    has indulged to a dangerously indiscriminate degree-- they're equally average, and one would be hard-pressed
    to pinpoint any particular standouts.  The suction cup bassline of ""Confusion"" stammers as if through rain
    puddles, a remarkable texture that teethes Tan's hushed but charmingly mispronounced vocal melody. Album
    single ""Crazy Love"" initially seems excusably repetitive, but as Tan continues singing, the song becomes
    unnecessarily tedious.  A similar problem plagues the sexy electro-dub of ""One Night in Tokyo"", which opens
    with conviction but soon whimpers out, and the found sound and renegade funk of ""Version"", which curiously
    recalls musique concrete icon Pierre Henry's psychedelic <i>Messe Pour le Temps Present</i>.</p><p>
<i>Again</i> would have made a much more solid album had it exhausted its ideas in half the runtime.  As
    it stands, there's simply not enough development within any track to justify its length, and the loops are
    too subdued and unengaging to hold its listeners' attention.  The album's second half seems less guilty of
    this than the first, as tracks like ""Silicone Sexy"" and ""Where"" undergo ample metamorphoses with a surely
    German, vaguely Kompakt degree of subtlety, as does ""Colder"", the goth album closer in which Tan's words
    trip over organs and minimal rhythmic affections. That said, for the musical merits often attributed to

A couple of albums, maybe some EPs or seven-inches
    to their name-- a discography that they crafted in their initial time together.  Frequently, it must be
    said, these reunions do much to tarnish the legacy of their discography.  But what happens when a band
    whose history is primarily the stuff of legend, and whose discography is mostly unofficial or pieced
    together from disparate sources, reforms to take another shot at something that never fully coalesced
    in the first place?  If this album from a reconstituted Rocket from the Tombs is any indication, great
    things.</p><p>
    Rocket from the Tombs were originally only a band for about 200 days in the winter of 1974 and the spring
    of 1975, but what transpired in that condensed period was intense, and helped to plot the course of punk
    and post-punk a couple of years before either of those phenomena reached the mainstream.  Part of what
    makes Rocket from the Tombs such an intriguing piece of rock arcane is that, as a band, they were lacking
    in a singular vision and direction-- rather, each member had his own ideas about where ideas and songs
    should be taken.  This tension naturally ripped the band apart at the seams, and in the process, spun off
    two of Cleveland's greatest groups, The Dead Boys and Pere Ubu.  However, the music written under those
    circumstances was a fascinating mélange of rock convention and restless experimentalism.</p><p>
    Most of it never made it to tape in any kind of fully realized state-- although both Ubu and The Dead Boys
    held over a few songs from the Rocket from the Tombs repertoire for their own catalogs-- instead surviving
    only in the form of crude demos and lo-fi live recordings made in the lofts of Cleveland as the city rusted
    outside.  Two years ago, we were finally treated to an official compilation of existing Rocket from the
    Tombs recordings, in the form of <i>The Day the Earth Met Rocket from the Tombs</i>, a hardly comprehensive
    but nonetheless invaluable and much-needed document that helped to flesh out a chapter of the punk story
    that had only previously been sketched in lightly.</p><p>
    The surviving band members couldn't help but notice the warm reception this disc received, and now, nearly
    30 full years after they were written, Rocket from the Tombs have finally made a proper album out of these
    tunes.  Calling it <i>Rocket Redux</i> is somewhat accurate, but frankly, the flippancy of the title doesn't
    do quite enough to recommend the album, which is as vital and energetic as any of their past recordings,
    although with much better sound.  The fact that these guys are all in their 50s now is astounding: David
    Thomas (who performed as Crocus Behemoth in his RFTT days) is still as deranged and surreal a vocalist as
    ever, and with the grit that original tombsters Cheetah Chrome (aka Gene O'Connor) and Craig Bell put into
    their respective guitar and bass playing, it feels like scarcely a day has passed.  Current Ubu drummer Steve Mehlman
    subs for Johnny Madansky, while Television's Richard Lloyd fills the void left by late guitarist Peter
    Laughner, perhaps the band's most visionary member, tragically felled by a drug habit in 1977 at 25.
    (Ironically, Laughner was once a candidate to replace Lloyd in Television).</p><p>
    This potent lineup spins through 12 Rocket from the Tombs originals, and it's easy to make the case that
    this is actually the best starting point for the curious seeking to check out the band.  Laughner's amazing
    ballad ""Amphetamine"" could go toe-to-toe with any Springsteen anthem from the same period, and is made all
    the more crushing by Laughner's references to premature death.  Thomas' delivery on this track is remarkably
    restrained, and you can tell that this performance means just a little bit more for him than the punk
    rave-ups that surround it.  Of course, those rave-ups are all excellent, with demented guitar interplay
    strangling ""Down in Flames"", while ""Never Gonna Kill Myself Again"" reveals itself as a close cousin of
    Mission of Burma's ""That's How I Escaped My Certain Fate"".</p><p>
    Elsewhere, ""Final Solution"" jitters and twitches, its crumbling melody (which heavily references ""Summertime
    Blues"") held up by adroit guitarwork, and eventually, spooky backing harmonies.  The guitars drip with
    passion on ""What Love Is"", as though Lloyd is trying to prove he belongs, while Thomas' refrain of ""Ain't
    it fun when you know that you're gonna die young?"" (penned by Laughner) comes out haunting and almost
    resigned.  The high-speed punk bookends ""Frustration"" and ""Life Stinks"" are frenzied and brutal, and the
    sound is like a punch in the gut compared to the previously available version.</p><p>
<i>Rocket Redux</i> never sounds like a complacent reunion record, and in a way, I suppose it's not really
    a reunion record in the first place so much as it's a debut album, played with all the hunger and fire of
    a band eager to make their mark on the world.  Rocket from the Tombs have already done that, of course, but
    I'm glad they came back to give it one more go, because the result is an album anyone investigating the
    roots of punk should have-- one that finally completes the band's chapter in rock's great book.</p></div>"|6815.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6815-rocket-redux/|8.3|Joe Tangari

    stretch of highway that runs along the ocean.  Call it the Jan Hammer <i>Miami Vice</i> effect: stiff
    beats, <i>Star Wars</i> laser sounds, simple three- and four-note melodies so unyielding in their
    repetition you can close your eyes and see the green lights moving left to right along the sequencer--
    put these ingredients together in the right way and you have a seriously enjoyable simple pleasure.
    Purely electronic music found early popular acceptance in electro, and sometimes the genre seems like
    the form most perfectly suited to the intuitive life of the machine.</p><p>
    
    On his debut full-length, <i>Neurofibrio</i>, Manchester's Mark Stewart (who releases music as Claro
    Intelecto) does electro right.  Electro is not all he's doing here-- the strong influence of Detroit
    techno is detectable as well, and he occasionally dips his toes into a more abstract ambient pool-- but
    the electro spirit is at the core of every musical gesture.  Though Stewart is a fan of 80s electropop,
    no track on <i>Neurofibrio</i> suggests that it could be a proper song if fleshed out with the right
    vocalist.  These songs work strictly by addition and subtraction; rather than developing, they snap in
    and out of place like joints.</p><p>
    
    The cool ""Percentages"" can be reduced to a few squelchy bass notes put together in a catchy way, a keyboard
    stab that sounds like a funk guitar sample, the kind of vintage Roland keyboard Jan Jelinek loves to sample,
    and a barely-there drum machine pattern.  They come and they go, but the piece never dulls over more than
    six minutes because each individual sound is so well rendered.  ""Mono"", with its half-clap snare hit and
    impossibly funky circular bassline is like Grandmaster Flash's ""Scorpio"" with the Furious Five laying out.
    ""Nobody"" and ""Contact"" add a 4/4 pulse and come closer to classic techno, upping the alienation and moving
    away from the street party vibe.</p><p>
    
    Though heavy on upbeat rhythmic cuts, a few impressionist tracks round out the record and make <i>Neurofibrio</i>
    even more compelling as a collection.  ""Baudrillards Supper"" and ""You Not Me"", for example, are stark, quiet
    tracks built from stark piano melodies that use glitchy percussion for contrast.  Yes, the record is a bit
    retro and we've definitely heard these sounds before, but electro is not a genre that demands constant
    innovation.  Nervous future-shock jitter and melancholy synth washes never go out of style.  This is the
    sound of the city from back when <i>Blade Runner</i> seemed like prophecy, but Claro Intelecto's take is
    patient and ultimately lets in a bit of light.</p></div>"|1760.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1760-neurofibrio/|7.6|Mark Richardson

Todd enjoys New Pornography,
    raglan, teardrop windows, timeless curves, and burnt sienna.  He's been called a throwback, even a kitschist
    by some elitist duffers.  But our audience thinks otherwise, and Todd's here today-- all the way from
    Vancouver!-- to tell us how it really goes down.  Take it away, Todd!</p><p>
    
    As it turns out, Todd Fancey does have a fetish for the filtered bliss of 1970s pop, strains of which stream
    through his self-titled debut like Toughskins through the turnstiles at a <i>Stand Back</i>-era April Wine
    gig.  But the New Porn guitarist seems to figure that the best way to celebrate is to reinvent, so he
    shades his songs in sun-dappled, modernist progressions.  ""Carry Me"" kicks things off with a warm, if
    slightly melancholic organ tone, but the introspection is quickly chased off by the introduction of
    a Wurlitzer, Fancey's first-class Beach Boys vocal, and that bouncy-ass arrangement.  Still, he admits to
    not knowing just where he's going: ""How pathetic I've become,"" he sings, the sentiment reflecting the
    sadness of the song's initial notes.  It's this sort of smart songwriting that makes <i>Fancey</i> such a
    <i>now</i> album.  It's referential, yet more mindful of mood than your average bearded 70s van
    driver/songwriter.</p><p>
    
    Keys and women are recurring themes on <i>Fancey</i>-- ""Dial Jupiter"" plays them off moon cheese and fuzz
    guitar, while ""Sunbrite"" layers whizzy synths and backup coos over a slight disco beat suggestive of Tahiti
    80 or Ivy.  Paranoia also continues to percolate here and there, particularly under the pedal steel shimmer
    of ""In Town"", but Todd is also content to sing about the simpler things in life: Getting high, for instance,
    figures mightily into this soft-focus equation.  But Fancey is at his best when he's focusing on utterly
    simplistic immediacy.  Would you like to hear a fun, giddily rocking song about drivin' and ""Rock and Roll
    Rhythm""?  Perhaps the pleasantly hungover quality of ""Saturday Morning"" is more your speed.  Well, close
    your eyes, then, and listen to the buttery Todd tones.  As he sings, harpists and wah peddle guitarists
    flicker and appear in the corners of your bedroom, and summer sunlight gleams in your girlfriend's hair.</p><p>
    
    Of course, wily pop freak that he is, Fancey has to fuck with that fuzzy Friday sex fantasy, following
    ""Saturday Morning""'s buzz with the resigned downer duet of ""'Til the Morning Comes"".  The contemplative
    organs and pretty synth washes are still here, but there's that melancholy again.  ""I was better off in
    bed,"" Todd begins haltingly, and his girl just asks for a ride home.  Still, despite its relationship
    woe, ""Morning Comes"" is one of <i>Fancey</i>'s stronger songs, beautifully sketching freehand over 70s
    references and the clean lines of 21st century soft rock.</p><p>
    
    After all its highs and those little counterbalancing lows, <i>Fancey</i> ends with the sweeter-than-citrus
    ""I'll Be Down"".  The Wurlitzer is happy again, and there seems to be some talk about doorways to the other
    side and dosing.  As the lilting beat starts to take effect, an accordion fades in from the ether, and the
    harmonies rise and fall like the breath of an early summer day.  Throwback?  Hardly.  Todd Fancey's just
    singing about those moments when the world is in focus, and life's as pretty as Miss September '73.</p></div>"|3297.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3297-fancey/|7.0|Johnny Loftus

This (admittedly reductive) theory would explain     not only the persistent whiff of the campfire that hovers about Mirah's music, but also her staggering     lack of self-consciousness.  A terrific songwriter when she bothers to finish her songs, Mirah finds her     own creativity fascinating enough to share every stage of the process with her listeners: To date, her     albums have brimmed with sketches, songlets, snatches of ambiance (crickets, etc.) and private snapshots     of in-studio fun.  At times, this 60/40 mix of confessional folk and <i>art brut</i> collage has felt     somewhat unnatural and not a little indulgent.</p>
<p>At the same time, Mirah's blissed-out obliviousness to form and format has kept fans and critics in suspense:     It was clear that as soon as she dropped the shtick, a great album would follow.  Teasers were plentiful--     the Cinemascope sweep of ""Cold Cold Water"" chief among them-- but the record she hinted at didn't arrive     until now.  If all the past tense hasn't tipped you off already, <i>C'mon Miracle is it.  Mirah, it     appears, has made the album we've been waiting for.</i></p>
<p>The author's endearing weirdness is still present; she's so utterly unconcerned with context that she     kicks things off with a jazzy ballad whose chorus coos, ""Come away with me.""  This time around, however,     Mirah's wilder impulses miraculously defer to songcraft first-- there's not a meandering note on the album.     Her trademark plinky ukulele draws polite curlicues throughout the record (and never receives its own track     listing); her barking percussion loops co-exist with warm 60s-style drums.</p>
<p>""The Light"" is an immediate highlight.  A two-parter that unfolds like a power ballad in reverse, its     first 90 seconds rock assuredly with a fantastically winding vocal line, while the second half slows to     a serene coffeehouse strum.  ""We're Both So Sorry"" is also quick to stand out-- of all <i>C'mon Miracle</i>'s     11 tracks, it comes closest to matching the bizarre grandeur of ""Cold Cold Water"".  Unidentifiable     instruments (is that an autoharp? harmonium? horns?) float in and out of its mix, just before a nasty     synth pulse takes over halfway through.  And at song's end, Mirah's fragile vocal enters just in time     to keep it all from collapsing in a heap: ""I'm sorry about so much, baby, but I know you understand.""</p>
<p>Straightforwardness does occasionally hinder Mirah in the lyric department.  ""Jerusalem"" squanders one of     the album's best melodies on ""lessons we should learn from all the fighting in the days of old"" and the     admonishing chorus of, ""So, now, Jerusalem, you know that it's not right.""  Thankfully, the singer's sense     of humor reappears just in time, in the album's gentle final third.  Mirah loves a fun shuffle (witness     <i>Black Mountain Music Project's ""Oh! September"" and the French-folk pastiche of ""Light the Match"",     off </i><i>Advisory Committee), and here, ""The Dogs of Buenos Aires"" and the tango closer ""Exactly Where     We're From"" lighten the proceedings a bit.  The album winds down quietly, almost apologetically, as if     seized by second thoughts about its own catchiness.  But these songs need no apology-- </i><i>C'mon Miracle</i> is not a crass bid for popularity, just an organic shift towards pop idiom.  I hope that Mirah herself     doesn't view it as a compromise or a concession; from here, it just looks like growing up.</p></div>"|5332.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5332-cmon-miracle/|8.5|Michael Idov

    span of the last decade, and with this release, is the first of his crew to unleash a solo record.  Produced
    entirely by shock rap magnate Necro, <i>What's Wrong with Bill?</i> is expectedly unflinching in its
    portrayal of the white ghetto experience with the feel of a dirty, limited run, behind-the-counter comic
    book.  But does it really take to new ground or is it the same routine that the Uncle Howie label seems to
    be running ragged?</p><p>
    
    Ill Bill seems to have two major precursors: Nas, and early Eminem, the latter of which is evident in his
    gruesome subject matter and aggressive, multi-syllabic lyrical style-- even his punchlines are macabre
    (""hotter than a crematorium"").  Here, Ill Bill portrays a character that sees in monochrome, struggles in
    Technicolor, and speaks with blood scarlet letters, rapping about serial killers, drug dealing and illicit
    sexual encounters.  Nas' influence, meanwhile, shows in Ill Bill's housing project observations-- though
    he goes a step further and commits as many of the crimes as he witnesses.</p><p>
    
    Either way you cut it, Ill Bill raps like a Tarantino film: verbose and violent, with opinionated societal
    overtones.  This is never more evident than on ""American History X"", where Bill spits vitriol over chimes,
    a jagged bass riff and a chopped soul vocal, detailing his disgust for the United States socio-political
    construct.  Most of his dissension is pointed towards taking down the powers that be, but his choir-preaching
    here proves one of the most grounded moments on the album.  Ill Bill raps like there's a bomb strapped to
    his chest, so his description of the American government hits hard when paired with his emphatic delivery:
    ""A Roman Empire in the present tense/ Murder for corporations that they represent/ Whether democrat or
    republicans, it's the same scumbag government/ With scumbag ways of running shit.""</p><p>
    
    Considering the negative stigma that the music community holds for Necro as a sinister whoremonger,
    few will deny his ability as a producer.  Distilling DJ Premier's processed drums, Pete Rock's seamless
    sample chops and the Automator's clean mixdowns, Necro amalgamates several pivotal elements in production
    to create a unique backdrop for Ill Bill to play across.  Whether he's juxtaposing G-funk synth lasers with
    70s bass grooves on ""Glenwood Projects"", crisscrossing suspended strings and shitkicking snares for ""The
    Final Scene"" or incorporating pedal-stomping guitar funk, hockey organ and barbershop choruses on
    ""Unstoppable"", Necro seems to have a delicate feel for the production that best suits his artist.</p><p>
    
    Still, Ill Bill's got a few issue to overcome: His heavy dependence on adlibs, for one, tends to turn every
    verse into its own chorus.  His songs also tend to settle for only two verses, which limits the album's length
    and conceptual development, and his disproportionate number of guest emcees can prove troublesome, depending
    on your taste (Goretex admittedly steals a song with ""Elvis is dead, but Tupac is living in Queens"").
    Additionally (and ironically), it seems Ill Bill's most creative song concepts fare the worst: ""Alien
    Workshop"" is a painfully rehashed <i>X-Files</i> rerun and ""The Anatomy of a School Shooting"" fails not
    due to its expected tastelessness, but in the way it refuses to expound on its tired subject matter.</p><p>
    
    That said, the production on <i>What's Wrong with Bill?</i> manages a surprising consistently across the
    span of the album, Bill's performances are always raw and tightly spun, and overall, his combination of
    intelligent gangster and masochistic serial killer is more effective here than ever before.  Ill Bill
    closes a song, stating, ""Fuck who's on top, 'cause I'm a lot hungrier than them.""  I'm inclined to agree.</p></div>"|4154.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4154-whats-wrong-with-bill/|7.7|Rollie Pemberton

    for mindlessly awesome celebratory ambiance: giant, anthemic hooks, a deference to dance before song-to-song
    variety, shit-for-brains lyrics, some vaguely political obnoxiousness, and, if they're being ironic, a
    remarkably impenetrable sense of irony.
    
    The record pulls no punches: Each track is stuffed with simple and catchy vocal and guitar melodies set
    against tight, no-frills rhythm sections and a Basement Jaxx-worthy sonic overload in between.  And with
    one big exception, the disc is front-to-back footworthy, never losing a bit of the steam it works up to
    within its first minute out of the speakers.  In fact, though it's probably to say too much or too little,
    U.S.E. could very well be 2004's Junior Senior: their debut delivers the immediate gratification that we
    came to associate with last year's <i>D-D-Don't Don't Stop the Beat</i>, and given the density of some of
    these songs, U.S.E. might eventually pack a little more replay value than their '03 predecessors.</p><p>
    
    The songs are consistently solid here, but if we're to rally behind one song as a possible single, ""Emerald
    City"" seems the surest shot: Its glittery vocoded opening gives way to a steady rhythmic pump and spiraling,
    intertwined choral and guitar melodies.  As the track progresses, U.S.E. wisely reconfigure their
    instrumentation, most notably keeping in check the guitar lines-- which could have been a mess of riffage
    and FX-aerobics-- without leaving them unrequited.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, ""Climb the Walls"" features some dynamic synth and guitar lines working wonders in tandem amidst
    ambient party noise and bass thump, and the shouts, horns, and seering guitar riffs that serve as the
    prologue to ""Open Your Eyes"" are rivaled only by the further developed reincarnations as the song plays
    out.  ""Vamos a la Playa"", meanwhile, appropriates what U.S.E. seems to think is a characteristically
    ""Latin"" shuffle, and with huge help from an 80s synthesizer line, anchors the album's last third quite
    well.  U.S.E.'s only critical misfire is when they tread in the shark pit of ""Night Shift"", whose G. Love-style
    pleasure rapping should have been confined to another plane.  Still, U.S.E. have put together a consistent
    collection of well-considered, boneheaded party anthems: Their album is just terribly fun-- nothing more,
    nothing less.</p></div>"|8382.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8382-united-state-of-electronica/|7.5|Nick Sylvester

Hotels are places of transience, refuge and the very briefest of romantic encounters.
    As I unwrap the cellophane from To Rococo Rot's fifth album, I can scarcely shake the memories of <i>Fear and
    Loathing in Las Vegas</i> in which Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo violate hotel rooms in ways that would have
    Aerosmith shrinking in repulsion.  Things <i>happen</i> in hotels.  The White Stripes (""Hotel Yorba""), Nick
    Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds (""God's Hotel""), and yes, even Cassidy &amp; R. Kelly (""Hotel"") have all recognized the
    strange echoes and rhythms that permeate these rooming houses of the drifting, unsettled and hedonistic.
    I, for one, was looking forward to To Rococo Rot's entry into this canon.</p><p>
    
    This German outfit started as an art project back in 1995, but despite their trademark smoothness, they seem
    to mute all expressive idiosyncrasies in favor of tribute to (and emulation of) any number of influences.
    Broadly speaking, <i>Hotel Morgen</i> fills in a few gaps between Kraftwerk and Plaid, but is never as
    interesting as this might suggest.  To their credit, they've resisted the forays into drum-n-bass that seem
    to tempt most stalwart electronica artists, but the Lippok brothers and Stefan Schneider do lean towards
    house (""Bologna"") and lounge (""Sol"") here without ever owning the styles.  In short, <i>Hotel Morgen</i>
    mirrors an array of contemporary electronic approaches, but its reflected image takes a bit of the luster
    away.  Not exactly The Animals' ""Hotel Hell"".</p><p>
    
    More than previous To Rococo Rot releases, <i>Hotel Morgen</i> is rooted in somnambulance, with lulling
    tracks like ""Non Song"" and ""Opak"" recalling Eno's <i>Music for Films</i> and <i>Apollo Atmospheres and
    Soundtracks</i> in a kind of hazy ambience that's always a little too clinical to ever be called ""warm.""
    Minimalist act SND, meanwhile, are masters of the palette borrowed by cuts like ""Bologna"" and ""Ovo"", the
    latter being this album's most abstract and challenging contender.  Unfortunately, this liberal borrowing
    of well-regarded electronic templates poses a problem for the trio, as they erratically adopt a few too
    many styles, and rarely live up to their inspirations.</p><p>
<i>Hotel Morgen</i> may be beautifully produced, but despite its expert attention to detail, few of these
    tracks truly engage in the way they seem meant to.  Although the adjective ""pleasant"" frequently springs
    to mind, To Rococo Rot are lagging creatively here, and as a result, the bulk of <i>Hotel Morgen</i> seems
    to soak in a kind of noncommittal sonic hibernation.  Perhaps they could do with a few nights in a real
    hotel.</p></div>"|8081.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8081-hotel-morgen/|6.0|Dan Lett

    would blame Kristin Hersh if she cut out touring altogether and switched full-time to an acoustic guitar
    and long spells in the studio.  On last year's sorely underrecognized <i>The Grotto</i>, Hersh's intense
    solo act had never sounded better.  But even as her solo work gets quieter, Hersh's rock side is louder
    than ever: Throwing Muses' 2003 reunion album, cut in just three weeks, knocked more cracks into plaster
    than any of their past albums.</p><p>
    
    This year, with almost no fanfare, Hersh started a brand-new punk band.  Like the Muses, 50 Foot Wave is
    a rock trio, and it features Muses bassist Bernard Georges-- but it's a different band, with none of the
    baggage and a completely new business plan.  50 Foot Wave is Hersh's rapid response project, built for
    short albums and long tours, and she promises that the group will self-release new EPs every nine months
    and support them with a hard-to-believe 100 shows a year.</p><p>
    
    Their first disc is so recognizably Hersh's that it immediately sounds like the Muses: Truck-collision
    guitars and flayed screams scrape over a pounding rhythm section, and the lyrics that make it to the
    surface either sound pissed off or grotesque (sample truism: ""Bones were made to be broken."")  But if 50
    Foot Wave resemble the Muses, they do so without the drama.  Much of the Muses' loudest work blew open
    like the earth and heaved with mood swings, like the emotional see-saw ""Pretty or Not"".  By contrast, 50
    Foot Wave is a succession of angry blows that end too fast to hurt.  Much as the bandname's promise of
    tsunami torrents fits the magnitude of Hersh's distortion, a sleeker metaphor might have suited them
    better-- something like a hyper-tuned sports car, that can take the corners of the band's multi-sectioned
    math-rock and run you down like so many pylons.</p><p>
    
    At this intensity, the six songs-- already broken into quick changes and hastily-dropped riffs-- can fly
    like an undifferentiated blur.  These aren't songs you'll get attached to, and if the band doesn't push
    its parameters, you may not need more than one EP at a time.  And, of course, Hersh can release that way
    if she chooses, like postcards from the road.  You can credit a lot of the date's exuberance to that
    marketing plan: After years of fighting with record labels, struggling for money and releasing albums on
    someone else's schedule, Hersh has total control of the product.  Younger bands play this hard because
    they're just psyched to record; mature bands sound this excited because they know they're getting the
    money.</p></div>"|3295.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3295-50-foot-wave/|7.6|Chris Dahlen

Fela's complex
    history, unwavering politics, and indelible musical legacy have created the kind of iconic anchor
    necessary to hold down an increasingly flimsy global culture.  Thank Universal for beginning the flood
    of reissues in 2000: now Fela's dark continental grind and scathing socialist message are reaching more
    Western listeners than ever before.  The dense, syncopated rhythms and low-end swell of Afrobeat currently
    tints almost the entire urban dance music palette, from revivalists like Antibalas to Common's hip-hop
    highlife to Afro-dub rockers Tussle.</p><p>
    
    Obviously, electronic music's extended instrumental breaks are especially suited to the Afrobeat makeover;
    witness Masters at Work's sweaty, traditionally propulsive ""MAW Expensive (A Tribute to Fela)"" or Bugz in
    the Attic's buzzing broken-beat remix of ""Zombie"" from 2002's <i>Red Hot + Riot</i> compilation. Ubiquity
    is perhaps a little late to the party, showing up with Bristol's Will Holland, under the moniker Quantic,
    doing his take on four-on-the-floor Afrobeat and breezy Braziltronica.  I've come to expect consistently
    fresh sounds from Ubiquity, and <i>Mishaps Happening</i> delivers a fair dose of their usual smoothed-out
    California breaks/sunrise house cocktail.  But when Holland dips his ladle into the Afrobeat bucket, he
    comes up lacking; watery production and hollow beats fall short of a potentially thunderous dance floor
    deluge.</p><p>
    
    Maybe it's a state of mind thing, because with certain clues, a listener expects certain results.  For
    instance, the shuffling rhythm, twangy guitar, and creaking sax that open the album have me anticipating
    an eventual knockout blow, which somehow never arrives.  The polyrhythmic chatter, organ-driven swagger,
    and crisp vocals on ""Use What You Got"" seem to prelude some kind of heavy climax, but again, we're left
    wanting.  If he were to steer clear of these Afrobeat signposts, Holland might have a much more effective
    album that perhaps relies on standard touchstones but actually delivers.</p><p>
    
    That's what we get at the album's midsection, which stands out with some interesting arrangements and
    well-crafted songs.  The funky ""Trees and Seas"" carries a blunted Thievery Corporation sparkle through
    another late night, while ""Angels and Albatrosses"", with its moody, distinctly downtempo sway, bobs along
    on waves of flute, marimba, and baritone, eventually leading to a satisfyingly serene resolution.  ""Prelude
    to Happening"" combines a subtle, snaking bassline, rolling drums, somber strings, and eerie vocals into a
    sizzling midtempo reverie; Holland's production and songwriting skills shine through in this pretty,
    elegiac dirge.</p><p>
    
    Holland's first two solo Quantic LPs received accolades from all the right tastemakers (Gilles Peterson,
    Richard Dorfmeister), and despite <i>Mishaps</i>' missteps, you can hear why.  Philly soul vocalist Spanky
    Wilson gives a true school feel to ""Don't Joke with a Hungry Man"" and ""When You're Through"", while ""Perception""
    delivers just the right amount forward-pushing velocity without veering into drum-n-bass histrionics.  The
    closing tune, ""So Long"", is perhaps the stylistic bridge that Holland strives for throughout the album.  I'm
    fairly certain that's banjo I'm hearing behind staccato strings, right after the dubbed-out breakdown and
    Alice Russell's silky crooning.  It's a sharply distinctive number that starts with a traditional break
    and lives up to its promise seven hypnotic minutes later.  There's no sign of Afrobeat pretense here--
    except for perhaps in its ardent grasp at funky forms-- and the song works beautifully.</p></div>"|6629.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6629-mishaps-happening/|6.9|Jonathan Zwickel

    the interim, it's easy to forget that they were once viewed as one of indie rock's greatest hopes for the
    future-- a future that, at the time of their second album, was still a calendar century away.  The Athens,
    GA trio got off to a quick start, gracing 1998 and 1999 each with a forward-looking, genre-defying album.
    In 2000, they dropped a highly-acclaimed collaboration with now-defunct slowcore nap-rockers Bedhead and
    then seemingly evaporated, leaving us to figure out where to redirect our anticipation.</p><p>
    
    So forgive me if I didn't figure they even existed anymore.  Four years is a long pause, but brothers Joshua
    and Mischo McKay, and their former housemate Kai Reidl, have emerged on the other end of their layoff with
    an album that, while not quite justification for the wait, nonetheless brims with the same restless creativity
    that spiked their early records, updated just enough to incorporate the moping massive's newfound fascination
    with all things rhythmic and pulsing.</p><p>
    
    Macha still retain the passion for Indonesian gamelan and arcane instrumentation that made their initial
    burst so distinctive, but it's relatively played down, relegated mostly to the corners in favor of Neo-Tokyo
    synths and a river of bass: <i>Forget Tomorrow</i> is a futurist's sonic Eden, a soundtrack to the arcades
    and clinics of William Gibson's Chiba City.  The album's first half cruises through this territory with the
    top down, breathing its air fully, and scooping up most of the good ideas that lie there.  The title track
    ought to be a single, with its deadpanned, vacuum-sealed melody, plasticine synth, flourishes of koto, and
    polished steel neo-Moroder groove.  It's sleeker than a Mitsubishi TV spot, but the recording's workmanlike
    nature renders it real.</p><p>
    
    ""(Do the) Inevitable"" adds the clanking Indonesian percussion that we've so come to expect on a Macha record,
    but the funky bassline and kick/hihat boom-chik are all Macha Mk II.  That beat comes back to support the
    echoing buzz of ""Smash &amp; Grab"", which smacks slightly of The Faint without nearly as much aggressive edge.
    A sprinkling of instrumentals provide the best link with the band's exotica kick, ""D-D-D"" clanging with
    gamelan, ""Paper Tiger"" awash with repetitive hammer dulcimer figures, and Silk Road melodies wafting on
    synthetic strings through the vibe-cluttered buzz of ""Sub II"".</p><p>
    
    All of this makes <i>Forget Tomorrow</i> a welcome return for Macha, who seem just as ready to expand their
    sound as ever.  A few ponderous interludes (especially ""While the People Sleep"", a go-nowhere ambient drag)
    hamper the record's momentum at inopportune times, which is a shame, given that, along with the joys of
    rhythm, the world has also recently rediscovered the benefits of the 40-minute runtime.  Still, this album
    confirms that Macha truly are long for this world, and I'll take that any day.</p></div>"|5019.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5019-forget-tomorrow/|7.4|Joe Tangari

German legends Faust, represented on this collaboration with New Jersey hip-hop     mavericks Dälek as Werner ""Zappi"" Diermaier, Hans Joachim Irmler, Steven W. Lobdel, Lars Paukstaff and     Michael Stoll, have fashioned a pretty unbelievable catalog of tunes from a stubborn insistence on     constant movement.  Granted, they haven't always moved at the same breathless pace they did in the     early 70s, but like their krautrocking peers in Can, Faust have proved to be among the most reliably     forward-thinking musicians of their generation.</p>
<p>Small surprise, then, to hear their glorious, droned-out take on hip-hop with Dälek.  <i>Derbe Respect,     Alder</i> (or ""crude respect, elder"") hardly sounds like any hip-hop I've heard; more like a druggy,     clamorous collage of industrial noise and feedback, with a stray loop every now and then.  Rather than     simply using Faust as their backing band, the trio of Dälek (Will Brooks), producer Oktopus (Alap Momin)     and turntablist Still (Hsi-Chang Lin) attack fragments and panic-ridden, acid-damaged jams as raw     source material, and opt to spout Last Poets-style free form verse over the more unhinged moments.  And     like The Last Poets, Dälek's agenda seems politically charged, as titles like ""Bullets Need Violence""     indicate.  Still, pure sound rules this collaboration, and they produce an intimidating, blunt jab     indeed.</p>
<p>Most of the music on <i>Derbe Respect, Alder</i> was recorded in 2002 and 2003 by Faust, then manipulated     by Dälek-- though the final (listed) track ""T-Electronique"" was taken from Faust's 1999 album <i>Ravvivando</i>.     I had first heard the track on the last <i>Wire Tapper</i> compilation, and it is, by some measure, the     most straightforward piece on the album.  Its bass-heavy, loping drum loop flails like cold, machine-generated     funk, but the heavenly organ clusters overhead are pristine and sweet, and could only have come from Germany.     Brooks references ""filthy tongues slowly severed"" and ""the constant threat that we easily forget,"" and aligns     himself perfectly with the claustrophobic paranoia of the track.  This version of ""T-Electronique"" should     be a godsend to anyone into hypnotic drone-funk.</p>
<p>""Imagine What We Started"" begins the album with cold wind and deep, unidentifiable bass tones, like stepping     into an endless underground tunnel and realizing all the fleeting noises behind and above aren't just products     of your ketamine buzz.  When the drums hit, all hell breaks loose: Oktopus and Still drench the loop with     delay so that Diermaier's drums sound like the work of three men hammering out polyrhythms best suited for     inducing motion sickness and hearing loss, yet it's fascinating in its disorientating force (which is     one way to describe my feeling for the album in general).  ""Hungry for Now"" introduces Brooks' voice for     the first time on the album, warning, ""If I have not met your expectations, try to conceive my frustrations     with an earthly tongue,"" over ever-offcenter drum/bass vamping from Diermaier and Stoll, while Lobdell's     guitar stains all available space with guitar drone and feedback approaching white noise.  See also the     second half of ""Dead Lies"" and grotesque motorik of ""Collected Twighlight"" for more apocalyptic dream-shriek.</p>
<p><i>Derbe Respect, Alder</i> is a tough record to size up: On one hand, its middle third can get so dense,     so unrelentingly bleak that it takes a particularly receptive thrillseeker to make it through unscathed;     on the other, its best moments (for example, the first and last tracks, not counting the brief hidden track)     are some of the best music I've heard this year, and their payoffs are reason enough to let the undertow     swallow you whole.  Regardless, Faust and Dälek demonstrate the capabilities of potent, creative minds and     insistent forging ahead of born experimentalists.  If that means a few people are left behind, all the     better to take in the hardcore bliss on your own.</p></div>"|3019.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3019-derbe-respect-alder/|7.6|Dominique Leone

    often rely on half-realized juxtapositions and convoluted, name-dropping analogies that circumvent the
    brainwork required to actually say anything useful.  But sometimes, comparisons are so bull's-eye-accurate
    they can't be avoided.  So I apologize in advance, Ryan; the rest of you go ahead, call me lazy: Petracovich
    sounds like Aimee Mann fronting Sparklehorse with Beth Orton calling in plays from the sidelines.  Of course,
    just because the dots are so easily connected doesn't mean <i>Blue Cotton Skin</i> is a simple piece of
    work.  Petracovich mastermind Jessica Peters produces a hypnotic dreamtime soundtrack, all misty insinuations
    and shimmering mirages, a surprisingly enduring album of muffled bedroom folktronica wrapped in the silken
    sheen of Peters' subdued songbird voice.</p><p>
<i>Blue Cotton Skin</i> is one of those remarkable debuts that, even as it pulls at so many stylistic threads,
    capably establishes a unique, cohesive vision.  There's an array of ingredients here that in less assured
    hands might unravel the consistently crystalline, dreamy mood, but Peters maintains the mystery.  For instance,
    the Portishead dub noir of ""Nighttime"" and the Julee Cruise minimalism of ""Fall from Trees"" are the dark
    yin to the sunny yang of ""Birds in Flight"", with its anthemic guitar, handclaps, sweeping strings, and
    sugary girl-pop background vocals.  The album's two instrumentals are mildly dissonant, experimental
    pieces: ""Coyote on the Moon"" rides an underwater calliope hum, while ""Rosebud"" plays with reversed reverb.
    Meanwhile, the stunning, sun-drenched ""Driving Home"" showcases Peters' sharp songwriting skills, its
    slow-unfolding and sensual, druggy buzz evoking a female take on ""Summertime Rolls"".  Here, Peters' cooing
    vocals, though understated and at times even whispery, are self-assured and strong, unleashing emotion
    through intonation rather than volume.</p><p>
    
    Like the low-key lullabies of Iron &amp; Wine, <i>Blue Cotton Skin</i> might first settle into deceivingly
    shallow territory, but close listening reveals rich production details and unusual song structures.
    ""Footsteps"", a patient, fuzzy revelation, offers a musical storyline that develops over a repeated piano
    melody, a programmed drum track, and droning guitar, closer to Michael Brook than Sam Beam.  Consisting of
    only thumb piano, kettledrums and Peters' phase-shifted vocals, ""Water House"" spooks like Tom Waits, while
    ""Company"" astral-travels with spacy effects and somber piano.  Peters and co-producer Tad Wagner, who also
    adds electric guitar and bass, introduce subtle electronic nuances and studio tweaks that give these songs
    a deep, alluring luster.</p><p>
    
    Clearly, Peters has a broad creative reach, exemplified by the album's overall haunting, stark beauty.  But
    the fact that Petracovich only delivers 30 minutes of music is unsettling in the end-- it seems odd that
    the record's so short and its ending so sudden.  Like a dream, <i>Blue Cotton Skin</i> entices the listener
    to a hidden island floating in the ether, but doesn't last long enough to allow him to dwell there.</p></div>"|6537.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6537-blue-cotton-skin/|7.0|Jonathan Zwickel

    PRCSS operated as trio of musical penpals: The guitarist sent a track to the bassist, who in turn added
    his own line before shipping it off to the vocalist.  They would trade these tapes back and forth via post,
    until deciding as a group that their collection of overdubbed tracks had become a song, and finally an
    album, and would then present the material as a complete full-length.</p><p>
    
    If this is no longer the case, and S PRCSS have become a full-fledged, in-the-flesh studio band, their
    latest outing, <i>Taste Like Daughter</i>, still both benefits and suffers from a certain internal
    distance.  In fact, if anything, the double-edged nature of the band's schtick is more pronounced than
    ever: S PRCSS seem to embrace this distance and capitalize on it, whereas previous recordings offered
    the sense that at times the band was attempting to mask its compositional wiring.</p><p>
    
    Here, the writing recalls less rock riffs than rockish dance loops, the mere risk of which makes S PRCSS
    worth talking about in the first place.  Every song immediately showcases the fantastic depth and openness
    of the production.  Take ""Look: Explosion! New Spring"", which opens with a set of autonomous guitar and
    basslines which form airy chords as if accidentally.  Yet, while momentous, the song somewhat stagnates by
    its second minute, perhaps because the gild of coincidental parts loses its initial luster, and, in light
    of the honest production, a paucity of ideas becomes apparent.  In this respect, the longer but infinitely
    more developed ""Your Motivation Is: Less Like This"" fares better, capitalizing on heavy reverb, healthy
    vocal melodies, and prominent basslines, and continues to traverse new ground six minutes in.</p><p>
    
    Drums play a more dominant role in other parts of the album, adding just enough punch to songs like ""The
    Sun Provides Vitamin D"" to temporarily compensate for the familiar 16th-note <i>MNML</i> pulses that seem
    all too convenient for the band to synch their individual parts to.  This guise, unfortunately, fails to
    conceal the song's uninteresting modulations and good but eventually tired hooks.</p><p>
    
    S PRCSS as a project is incredibly tight, but perhaps sterile as a consequence.  ""I'm a Motorcycle Drummer"",
    for its killer syncopation and haunting female vocals, should be more effective than it is.  To a lesser
    extent, the same goes for ""I Call I Gorilla (Mountain Lifter)"", a two-minute power rocker with some seriously
    great vocal work-- for all its excitement, the end of the song seems contained and non-threatening.  It's
    an unorthodox thing to say, but I wanted to hear more mistakes on <i>Taste Like Daughter</i>.  It's simply
    too precise, and as a result, lacks the immediacy and spontaneity expected from its genre.</p><p>
    
    As a closer, ""Give the Beaches to the People"" is a good summation of what S PRCSS has accomplished so far,
    and what lies in store for them if they choose to continue in this direction.  Stuffed with hooks and catchy
    vocals, the song retreads typically energized territory, but then launches into the album's first bonafide
    riff: all instrumentation drops out to a bassline that's eager to rise to this solo occasion.  It's flat-out
    sick, and in the last 30 seconds of the song, the drums and guitars just chase the line to no avail.  It's
    the album's most blatant battle wound, an unexpected break from precise S PRCSS stratego, but the payoff
    is huge.  The band could stand to indulge in more of these sanguine moments.</p></div>"|7758.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7758-taste-like-daughter/|6.7|Nick Sylvester

    the greatest fucking band.  Oh wait, rock 'n' roll <i>does</i> have everything to with attitude, and the
    Icarus Line <i>are</i> the greatest fucking band.  Sure, there are thousands of bands who are wittier, louder,
    more sophisticated, and in general, more musically rewarding.  But if you want obstinance, irreverence
    and depravity, I dare you to find a band that offers it in such gratuity.  Too late: You see, after six
    years of infamous live shows and a scant yield of exactly one EP and one full-length, the Icarus Line have
    finally gotten serious, which means the derisive West Coast braggarts have sacrificed their reputation.
    This, of course, means they're no longer the greatest fucking band.  They're better.</p><p>
    
    Call it a fair trade off: By simply playing by the rock 'n' roll rulebook-- whose article 17, section 4
    strictly dictates that ego, excess and publicity stunts are to take complete precedence over, you know,
    songs-- <i>Penance Soiree</i> is one of the better straight-up records you're bound to hear from the
    genre all year.  Known for their manic behavior onstage and scuzzy surfeit off, the Icarus Line could win over scores of fans without even playing a note.
    But who cares that the band wear moddish black-and-red uniforms when they <i>sound</i> red and black?
    Unlike most groups who arch back to rock 'n roll's premillennial salad days, the Icarus Line are visceral
    enough in their music alone, and <i>Penance Soiree</i> proves it before even the chorus of its opening
    track.</p><p>
    
    Of course, this isn't anything you haven't heard before.  All the requisite pieces are in place: scalding
    guitars, amply flanged vocals, bombastic drums, and a bassline that sounds like nothing so much as running
    sewage.  But while a track like ""Up Against the Wall"" may not be aching to raze any monuments, it forcefully
    achieves all that it sets out to accomplish: Dubiously recorded to be difficult to hear unless played at a
    high volume, the song leaves the listener itching for a bath.  In fact, one would be wise to come prepared
    for this record with plenty of sweat rags and water bottles: Like a good workout, <i>Penance Soiree</i>
    pushes you until you're red-cheeked, wet-faced and utterly exhausted.</p><p>
    
    Hearteningly, the album loses hardly a step in its finery.  Joe Cardamone's vocals are properly wanton
    throughout this rabble-rousing tour de force, and while it's all too easy for lyrics about sex to succumb
    to sleaze, on ""Party the Baby Off"", it's all too tempting to oblige Cardamone's cries of ""Take off all your
    clothes!""  Carnal and prurient throughout, <i>Penance Soiree</i> is absorbing in its decadence and rarely
    alienating in its ferocity.  Technically, the music is necessarily indestructible; sloppy performances would
    allow these reckless tunes to spiral out of control, but the compositions are unerringly tight, nailing
    unison figures and hopping meter with insane dexterity.</p><p>
    
    But alas, the well of ideas from which the Icarus Line draw is limited, and while all their efforts are
    deftly executed, a handful of the tracks fall flat.  While most records of its kind are precariously
    frontloaded, <i>Penance Soiree</i> lags only in its third quarter.  Earlier on, the album's repetitive
    helps impede the galvanizing (if static) riffs, but later, the songs move from a torrid gallop to a haggard
    chug, as Cardamone's libidinous wails peter out into a bluesy drawl.  ""Big Sleep""'s title is particularly
    apt: The song is full of razoring kicks, but pitifully low on hooks.  Elsewhere, ""White Devil"" and ""Meatmaker""
    are mercifully fast-paced, but nevertheless somewhat cloying melodically.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, the two closing tracks redeem the missteps of the preceding numbers.  ""Seasick"" provides
    <i>Penance Soiree</i>'s most interesting textural moment in its icy two minute decline, an arrhythmic
    descent into a howling ocean of feedback.  And then, just as the album has seemingly crashed from its
    meteoric highs, the band sign off with ""Party the Baby Off"", a bouncy rocker that may well inaugurate its
    own British-style Invasion from the snowy peaks of Sierra Nevada.  They may not be the wittiest or most
    erudite band around, but the Icarus Line pummel with an intentness and honesty that trumps the best of
    their contemporaries.</p></div>"|4153.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4153-penance-soiree/|7.8|Sam Ubl

    books room every day for a couple weeks so a friend could listen to Kenneth Patchen read his poetry on
    hissy Folkways LPs.  Though a total pain in the ass, the effort seemed in keeping with the rambling spirit
    of the wordsmith: Patchen published more than 36 books between 1936 and 1972, and his style, experiments
    and collaborations with jazz musicians inspired what folks eventually started pigeonholing as the Beat
    Generation.  Also a painter, he often created luminous impressions of his poetical works on canvas.  These
    ornate broadsides-- crammed with cursive lettering, brightly colored flowers, bird-torn wind and smiling
    bird people-- resembled fliers for psych-rock concerts held in the trees.</p><p>
    
    The Skygreen Leopards took their bandname and the title of their third album from Patchen's writings.  The
    liner notes of <i>One Thousand Bird Ceremony</i> offers a blessing to the artist, and judging from the
    feathered collages decorating the album, the band is nearly as fond of anthropomorphic fowl as he was.
    Formed in 2001, The Skygreen Leopards are Glenn Donaldson and Donovan Quinn.  My vote for man of the year
    2003, Donaldson founded the Jewelled Antler label/collective with Loren Chasse and plays in quite a few
    amazing groups including The Blithe Sons, Thuja, The Franciscan Hobbies, and The Birdtree.  Quinn, another
    regular Jewelled Antler contributor, is the son of Country Weather bassist and vocalist Dave Carter and
    records as Verdure.  This is the duo's third album, and their first widely distributed release after two
    limited-edition CD-R's.</p><p>
    
    Like much of Glenn Donaldson's other work, <i>One Thousand Bird Ceremony</i> starts off with ambient
    forestal noises, chirps, the acoustic peregrinations of other animals, and properly spare bells.  While
    certainly making use of Jewelled Antler tenants such as recording without predetermined lyrics or chord
    changes, instead of droning psychedelia, The Skygreen Leopards create blissful pop songs interwoven with
    ambient hiss and naturally occurring sounds.  At times comparable to The Birdtree, the work's even tighter
    here, bringing to mind tiny nuggets of Syd Barrett and the Incredible String Band.  Or a pack of silvan
    spirits on a Beatles kick.  Unlike the usual one-track Jewelled Antler outing, <i>One Thousand Bird Ceremony</i>
    was recorded on an on 1/4"" tape to an 8-track; accordingly, the works house additional layers of 12-string
    guitars, banjo, bouzouki, jaw harp, mandolin, dulcimer, organ, and echoplex.  It's like listening to a
    muted late-period Lilys (or Kinks) recording in the bird house at the local zoo.  Yes, rural folk for the
    hook-obsessed pop fan.</p><p>
    
    In an album full of highlights and very few lows, the best moments are incredibly beautiful.  ""Where Do
    Songs Come From"" answers its stated question with the lilting sound of a breathless penny whistle
    disappearing below a horizon.  Turning jaw harp into a lovely percussive accompaniment, ""Let Me Grow in
    Your Meadow"" rings with Monkees lamentations and pastoral crab-grass drifts.  Equally idyllic, ""Walk with
    the Golden Cross"" hits echoing falsettos that rise and fall above a field of tinny percussion, downcast
    arpeggios and tambourine.  The lengthiest track, ""A Breeze of Pine Blows Through Me"", follows a sleepy
    firefly in a race amid the browning needles of a sapless tree.</p><p>
    
    The final track, ""Summer Pharmacy"" (linked thematically to the opener, ""Summer Alchemy"") points towards
    Donaldson and Quinn's ability to find the benefits of song in the most unlikely places, including the
    shifts between seasons, within blades of grass, in the honeyed clouds, on the dark side of a leaf changing
    color, beneath an icy rock.  As the concept of ""New Weird America"" broadens to encompass more than it
    likely should, The Skygreen Leopards drift languidly in and out of song, quiet locating the best sun spots
    in a way that seems both tossed off and perfectly formed.  Actually, Patchen's ""Pastoral"" describes it
    dead-on: ""The Dove walks with sticky feet/ Upon the green crowns of the almond tree/ Its feathers smeared
    over with warmth/ Like honey/ That dips lazily down into the shadow...""  Now translate that into joyful
    song.</p></div>"|7759.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7759-one-thousand-bird-ceremony/|8.5|Brandon Stosuy

    the Drive-By Truckers' most recent album, <i>Decoration Day</i>: When ""the dead-end life just drags you down/
    [You] turn those demons into walls of goddamned noise and sound.""  For more than a decade, Hood has been
    transforming all that preys on him into songs that are loud, rowdy, and angry, but also humorous, intelligent,
    and compassionate.  His demons are both personal and regional: He's been scarred by the racial, cultural and
    economic double standards that pervade the South and outsiders' perceptions of it, as well as by the
    tragedies of his own life, which include divorce, deaths, desertions, and Drive-By Truckers.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Killers and Stars</i>, his first solo album, these same demons inform songs that are quieter, but no
    less haunted or intense. Originally not intended for commercial release, the album was recorded
    <i>Nebraska</i>-style in Hood's living room and in various locations-- Auburn and Florence, Alabama;
    Athens, Georgia-- following his divorce, and then pressed in small runs and sold exclusively at shows.
    In the liner notes, Hood writes that the album was ""therapy"" and insists he left it purposefully unfinished.
    While these assertions may sound like expectations-lowering disclaimers-- that the sound and the songs will
    be rough, that the tone will be achingly confessional-- Hood is too extroverted a songwriter to be wholly
    defensive or self-absorbed.  Alone or with the band, he comes to himself through other people, whether
    musical influences like Ronnie Van Zant, cultural figures like George Wallace, or just friends and family.</p><p>
    
    As the album and song titles suggest, there's a crowd of people on <i>Killers and Stars</i>-- including Walt
    Disney, Belinda Carlisle, Georgia native Chan Marshall (aka Cat Power), Frances Farmer, even people you don't
    know, like Phil and Alice-- and these songs are more about them and how Hood sees them than they are about
    him solely.  He foresees Walt rising from his deep-freeze and wrecking havoc on the Eisner-ized company for
    ""forty years of decisions made""; chastises Carlisle for shedding her punk roots for ""cocaine and milkshakes,
    milkshakes cocaine""; and gently criticizes Cat Power for her precarious stage persona, although he could be
    directing that last line at himself: ""If you're really so shy why are you standing in the light?""</p><p>
    
    The most interesting people on <i>Killers and Stars</i>, however, are the unnamed non-celebrities: the
    rising son, the assassin, the hobo, the old timer.  Songs like ""Rising Son"" (a cover of which might have
    fit nicely into Johnny Cash's <i>American Recordings</i> repertoire), ""The Assassin"" and ""Hobo"" are not
    literally autobiographical or genealogical; they tell their truths figuratively, almost literarily.  But as
    always, Hood's family supplies him with his richest subject matter.  His then-recent divorce produced ""Miss
    Me Gone"", a break-up song every bit as conflicted and complex as <i>Decoration Day</i>'s ""(Something's Got
    to) Give Pretty Soon"".  ""Old Timer's Disease"" begins with Hood's grandfather being drafted at 42 and
    describes his hard life after World War II, then discloses his illness: ""He spends his days just looking
    around/ But he's forgotten what he's looking for.""  Hood understands the importance of character and story,
    so the first two verses build to those quietly devastating last lines, which form the album's climax.</p><p>
    
    That ""Cat Power"" instead of ""Old Timer's Disease"" ends <i>Killers and Stars</i> belies its unfinished state,
    and reveals a paradox almost endemic to projects like this: The songs can stand by themselves, never requiring
    the Truckers' larger sound to liven them up, but as spare as they are and given the circumstances of their
    recording, they're somewhat limited in their scope and sound.  While its ultimate fate will likely be as a
    footnote to his full-time band's long haul, <i>Killers and Stars</i> is strong enough to stand as a separate
    entity, a personal statement from Hood, sovereign from the interlocked identities of the Drive-By Truckers.</p></div>"|3982.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3982-killers-and-stars/|7.4|Stephen M. Deusner

Singer/songwriter Amy Annelle tapped
    a who's who of Portland, Oregon to record <i>The Autopilot Knows You Best</i>, a minor masterpiece of indie
    pop where folky violin and accordions complemented the crazy-scientist sounds of shortwave static and lost
    voices.  Melodic indie pop brushed against swaying acoustic ballads, and although her low, murmuring voice
    gave it a dreamy coherence, <i>Autopilot</i> was also an exciting patchwork: Each track made a new discovery.</p><p>
    
    The follow-up, finished in 2002 but not released until this month, couldn't be more different.  On <i>Call
    It Sleep</i>, exhaustion hangs from Annelle's voice like dust in her hair.  Each ballad sounds weary to the
    bone, not from melancholy or a nameable heartache, but like built-up fatigue: Annelle has flopped on your
    couch after ten hours of crossing dry, identical landscapes, and you can't tell if she wants to talk about
    it.</p><p>
    
    The album runs more slowly and evenly than <i>Autopilot</i>, as lazy guitars scraggle over the shuffling of
    drums and upright bass, but the focus lies with Annelle and the nuances in her vocals.  She sings in a low
    voice whose undertones resonate like blowing on the neck of a beer bottle.  Intimate and unforced, she comes
    close to vanishing before your eyes: Witness how ethereally she blends into the radio static on ""Program Ten"".
    And by singing quietly, she compels, especially when she pipes up or lets the notes swell and coast, as on
    ""Ruined New Life"".</p><p>
    
    At its best, <i>Call It Sleep</i> has gorgeous melodies and a clear sense for atmosphere, never overplaying
    its fragility or stifling the mood.  She refrains from big moments, except on the album's more propulsive
    finish, ""'Til the Death""-- but more typical are the sways from troubled to resolute, the shift from ""Travel
    Light""'s desolation to the steady outdoor cantina waltz of ""Clean Starts"".</p><p>
    
    But it's also a less remarkable album than its predecessor, despite its own round of guest stars.  Members
    of The Decemberists, The Swords Project, and Death Cab for Cutie, but nobody steals the spotlight: The extra
    instrumentation they provide is subtle, from the treading-on-glass vibes to the half-drowned piano on the
    achingly delicate ""Dead Reckoning"".  Additionally, fans of <i>Autopilot</i> might miss the quirky variety
    and ""geek chic"" of its experimentation and science references; on her cover of The Dreamies' ""Program Ten"",
    Annelle takes some playtime with shortwaves and sampling, but it's not as ebullient as the last album's
    cover of Syd Barrett's ""Late Night"".  The tone is heavy, and the decision to sequence the slowest songs
    (""What I Wouldn't Do for You"", ""Travel Light"") in succession almost stops the album.  Where The Places'
    last LP served as a pop complement to Annelle's quieter solo outings, <i>Call It Sleep</i> doesn't spark
    new ideas so much as shore up her work as a singer and songwriter.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, <i>Call It Sleep</i> works as a transition album-- in her career, and also in the content of
    her lyrics.  Even at its quietest, the record isn't sad so much as pensive: The ballads' reserve and the
    song titles like ""Clean Starts"", ""Travel Light"", or ""Ruined New Life"" evoke a sense of Annelle changing
    gears and deciding where to head next.  She doesn't conjure as many possibilities as before, but she hones
    in on the choices that count.</p></div>"|6330.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6330-call-it-sleep/|7.3|Chris Dahlen

But unless there's some punk behind that disco, we aren't likely to indulge in dance music too often-- let alone dance to it.  Because unlike indie rock, dance music's all the same, it's gay, and if it's in Massachusetts, its equal marriage rights are probably going to be denied.</p><p>  Wait a second: Is it 1998 again?  Because I remember more than a few of us thought the same thing about IDM, until we were all persuaded to pick up Boards of Canada's <em>Music Has the Right to Children</em>. It was electronica and it was taboo, but we purchased in good faith because it was on Matador, a label we trusted.  Boy, did we love the shit out of it-- and there weren't even guitars!</p><p>  Erlend Øye's <em>DJ Kicks</em> seems like that kind of gateway record.  Its most instantly alluring trait is its surprising pop/rock-accessibility, but-- for a guy most people know for his tenure in the hushed folk duo Kings of Convenience-- it's also remarkably innovative in its field.  Here, in a move that really is not as gimmicky as it might seem, Øye frequently dubs his own buoyant tenor over bright dancefloor instrumentals and vocal tracks.  Interestingly, these lyrics are often culled from well-known pop classics (such as The Smiths' ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out""), with slight melodic changes.  It's a fascinating, vaguely mash-up-like approach that effectively softens the blow for non-tech-house listeners, while also assuring each track a strong hook and lending the record a quality often underdeveloped in other DJ mixes: namely, a discernible personality.</p><p>  Enough can't be said about the quality and variety of these tracks, and the unique sense of humor with which Øye approaches their sequencing.  Take how subtly Øye gives new life to Jürgen Paape's ""So Weit Wie Noch Wie"", an instant tech-house gem that notably appeared on Kompakt's <em>Total 3</em> compilation: If only because the song is so often associated with the close of that mix, it takes on an unusual potency as Øye's kickoff.  The Paape opener is firm anchorage for the string of slick German dance tracks which Øye weaves in and out of the other numbers: Justus Köhncke's slick 1980s-meets-2100s groove ""2 After 909""; Jackmate's phaseshifted jitterbug ""Airraid""; Ricardo Villalobos' blipped-up but downtrodden ""Dexter"".</p><p>  Øye's slick tech-house base allows him some indulgences: There are the truly laidback moments like his tasteful remix of Cornelius' ""Drop"", Phoenix's less dance-oriented but utterly catchy French house gem ""If I Ever Feel Better"", and downright silly tracks like Avenue D's ""2D2F"".  It's amazing the latter track works as well as it does: its lyrics (""Don't pass out going down on me/ Or I'll wake you up with a mouth full of pee"" is but one) put the entire Peaches and Fannypack catalogs to shame.</p><p>  For these moments alone, the mix is perfectly enjoyable, but where Øye distinguishes himself is on two back-to-back tracks near the end of <em>DJ Kicks</em>, in which he explosively pits the familiar against the obscure.  Over a dark monochromatic Silicon Soul remix of Röyksopp's ""Poor Leno"", Øye overdubs his soft but confident croon of The Smiths' ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"", which reaches a quiet climax when Øye's vocals from ""Poor Leno"" surface momentarily in the background, then disappear.  Just as compelling is when the ultra-obscure track Skateboard's ""Metal Chix"" provides a velvet-metal backdrop for Øye's heartfelt delivery of ""Always on My Mind"", synching up the chorus with the accompaniment's dreamy interlude. We could stand more mash-ups like this and much less Jay-Zeezer.</p><p>  Those two songs seem to encapsulate Øye's intentions with his <em>DJ Kicks</em> album.  In the liner notes, he places his DJ style somewhere between a house DJ who plays to drugs, dancing shoes, and ""the artistic dimension"", and a wedding DJ who plays strictly to vaguely foot-worthy nostalgia.  ""I am not really a skilled beat-mixer,"" says Øye-- which is only sort of true-- but it's clear that he's as concerned with his track selection as with making sure that his listeners are enjoying themselves: ""A good DJ is not only musically responsible, but he is also the host of the party.""  With <em>DJ Kicks</em> bearing testament, Øye's party is truly a democratic one: The record is as warm and welcoming for first-timers as for longtime tech-house addicts.</p><p> </p></div>"|6079.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6079-dj-kicks/|8.2|Nick Sylvester

There was a time when an author couldn't get a book published in this country
    without a heady dose of the stuff.  Now there's a million-dollar market for literalist (but no less
    bodacious) claptrap about adultery or impending nuclear holocaust, for those who aren't up to <i>Madame
    Bovary</i> or <i>A Childhood's End</i>.  Music, meanwhile, has performed an inverse about-face: Where
    Mötley Crüe, and their fans, once proudly patronized strip clubs, folks who dig The Darkness constitute a
    putatively ""enlightened"" set.  Similarly, there may be some ulterior motives behind Surferosa's Day-Glo
    merriment.  Frankly, I no longer care.  This irony shit has gone too far.  When it all boils down, the
    songs are what matter, and by that standard, the Norwegian quintet are as indistinguishable from novelty
    as artists like Andrew W.K. and Electric Six.</p><p>
    Naturally, Mariann, the group's luminous lead singer, has already attained celebrity status in her homeland,
    and was reportedly the subject of a feature-length documentary on one of Norway's highest-rated television
    channels.  Her presence here is that of Debbie Harry in Blondie, or, more aptly for her comparable suck
    quotient, Gwen Stefani in No Doubt: It could be anyone playing behind her.  For better or worse, she
    dominates.  <i>Shanghai My Heart</i>'s 11 songs all carry the same saccharine vibe, bouncing from verse
    to chorus to verse on bubbles of blithe synth and hackneyed riffs-- and Mariann's brazen ubiquity is
    hardly captivating or original enough to sustain the gimmickry.</p><p>
    Unfortunately, Surferosa are unrelentingly catchy.  After a listen or two, you'll likely find many of the
    songs on <i>Shanghai My Heart</i> entrenched in your brain like terrorists in an Afghan cave, and it may
    take some serious sonic artillery to smoke 'em out.  But no lame simile could fully convey the unadulterated
    poppiness of this album; that task is best left to the omnipresent forebears of Surferosa's rah-rah retro
    rock.</p><p>
    Despite ""Lucky Lipstick"", which opens the record on a promising note, <i>Shanghai My Heart</i> suffers from
    a dearth of original ideas, and fails to resurrect those it parses in a noteworthy manner.  Adding to the
    list of bands that have rehashed kitschy musical trends in wildly exaggerated form, Surferosa take aim at
    Debbie Harry and Kim Wilde with the same outrageousness with which The Darkness and Electric Six took to
    schlock rock, and the result is equally vacuous.</p><p>
    ""Canuba Toystore"" is replete with quixotic guitar-synth interplay that might have helped get Rocky pumped
    for his showdown with Ivan Drago.  Meanwhile, over the track's power-chord-laden intro, a petulant Mariann
    shouts, ""This is a song about... toys!"", in what could perhaps be an awful twist on the Pixies' ""Tony's
    Theme"" off the album from which this band takes its name.  Elsewhere, ""Neon Commando"" and ""Olympia"" dish
    out synth-happy dross that falls somewhere between Avril Lavigne and ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"".
    Particularly brutal is the nonsensical ""Bim Bam Boom"", which aspires to poignancy in its grave chorus:
    ""Scooby, Scoo-by Doo/ Bim, Bam, Boom/ Bim/ Bam Boom.""</p><p>
    Self-proclaimed ""fun"" music is notoriously difficult to pull off without slipping towards vacuity.  Major
    keys and songs deluged in synthetic production effects aren't inherently bad; rather, their relationship
    with poor songwriting is stigmatic, not causal.  <i>Shanghai My Heart</i> isn't repellent because of its
    convivial synths and aseptic production, but in this context, these elements only serve to make weaker
    songs more obnoxious.</p></div>"|7756.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7756-shanghai-my-heart/|4.5|Sam Ubl

    to its most basic structure and played on a solo instrument.   If this is to be taken as an accurate gauge
    of musical value, then the Beta Band might be the worst fucking band in history.  On their debut, <i>The
    Three EPs</i>, the Scottish foursome turned the periphery of songwriting into the main attraction, applying
    multilayered production and serpentine song structures to chords and melodies that repeated to the point of
    self-nullification.  The group's second, self-titled album took this approach even further, as what seemed
    at first like petty musical asides were developed into the record's most striking and fully realized moments.
    These records' effects were world-class icing on cardboard cupcakes, using the traditional foundations of
    strong songwriting as a placeholder before smothering them in sweetness.</p><p>
    
    A steady diet of icing, however, can only last so long.  The Beta Band's last record, 2001's <i>Hot Shots
    II</i>, showed the band grappling with a lack of ideas for the first time.  The songs themselves were every
    bit as drony and repetitive as those on the first two records, but lacked the fascinating production tricks
    and odd instrumentation of their best work.  Indeed, the un-structure that made the first two Beta Band
    records so captivating seemed to have evolved into a structure of its own.</p><p>
    
    On their fourth album, <i>Heroes to Zeros</i>, that structure is further solidified, to decidedly mixed
    results.  ""Assessment"", the album's first single, toys with the kind of playful dynamics that made <i>The
    Three EPs</i> such a dense listen.  In true Beta Band fashion, the heart and soul of ""Assessment"" is little
    more than the interplay between two similar guitar parts, and one fantastic drum fill.  A few minutes into
    the song, a simple bassline rises to prominence before quickly and elegantly segueing back into a chorus.
    It's a nice diversion, but one can't shake the feeling that The Beta Band of yore could have turned it into
    an epic.  The more disjointed final section of ""Assessment"" is similarly frustrating-- several great ideas
    are explored, but the band moves between them with an abandon uncharacteristic to even their most slapdash
    work.</p><p>
    
    Still, ""Assessment"" remains one of the best tracks on <i>Heroes to Zeros</i>.  On ""Lion Thief"", frontman
    Stephen Mason's recurring deadpan, ""The fruits are the loops are the friendships that droop,"" approaches
    self-parody, rendering painfully clear the more formulaic aspects of the band's sound.  And sadly, the
    attempts at departure don't fare much better.  ""Easy"", with its embarrassing Stevie Wonder keyboards, could
    be the low point of all of The Beta Band's catalog.  The tepid ""Wonderful"" is particularly unfortunate for
    its thematic similarities to <i>The Three EPs</i>' awe-inspiring ""She's the One"", host to one of the most
    forceful and moving crescendos I've ever heard.  The Beta Band's best moments often came when they worked
    in extremes-- minimal sampled beats followed by insane, multitracked chipmunk vocals and massive,
    reverb-soaked drum fills.  Here, as with <i>Hot Shots</i>, the band attempts to split the difference,
    and in doing so, sacrifices the momentum that made their first two albums so thrilling.</p><p>
    
    Thankfully, <i>Heroes to Zeros</i> picks up with ""Out-Side"", by far the album's standout.  Opening with
    overbearing beats and an unusual barking dog sample, the song soon breaks into reverb-laden vocals and
    rough electric guitar.  Later, screeching synthesizers penetrate the mix, signaling yet another substantial
    textural change.  But then, the song is awkwardly followed by ""Space Beatle"", whose chorus of, ""I love you
    to pieces,"" registers as a watered-down rehash of ""Out-Side""'s subtle and charming ""I love you"" chorus.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, <i>Heroes to Zeros</i> is host to an unusually large number of deja vu's.  Most of these moments
    simply evoke <i>Heroes to Zeros</i>' increasing reliance upon form and formula-- but not all of them.  At
    about three minutes through ""Out-Side"", I found myself checking my stereo to see if what I was hearing was
    still part of the same song, and it immediately brought to mind the experience of listening to <i>The Three
    EPs</i> for the first time.  For just a little while, The Beta Band once again sounded like a band that
    could turn three notes into a symphony.</p></div>"|671.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/671-heroes-to-zeros/|6.9|Matt LeMay

According to my dictionary, a decahedron is a ten-faceted, 3D
    object.  Meanwhile, Decahedron, the new trio featuring Fugazi's Joe Lally and ex-Frodus members Shelby
    Cinca and Jason Hamacher, have plastered a big two-dimensional octagon all over their artwork of their
    debut album, presumably taking it as their logo.  Don't get me wrong; it's a fine image.  But shouldn't
    it at least be ten-sided?  I'm just saying is all.</p><p>
    
    As tenuous as the band's relationship with mathematics may seem from a glance at the cover, though, they
    don't seem to have any problem with complex meters or nasty syncopation when they're throwing down in the
    studio.  Hamacher and Cinca recorded and produced <i>Disconnection Imminent</i> themselves, giving it a
    sharp-edged yet accessible polish that accentuates the band's brutal precision.  Cinca tends to deliver
    his lyrics with ragged shouts, but also exhibits impressive control over his screams, which at times manage
    to border on melodic; Lally's smooth, even tenor, meanwhile, offers a balance that's highly effective in
    driving home the political rage that seethes within the band's lyrics.</p><p>
    
    Though Decahedron take pains not to tailor their criticisms too specifically to the moment at hand,
    <i>Disconnection Imminent</i> puts its agenda upfront more forcefully than any album I've heard since
    Bush, Jr. took office.  As a general rule, their criticisms of current Administration policy are open to
    interpretation, but anyone who's close to being on the same page with these guys will know who and what is
    being referred to by lines like, ""A half-wit was his henchman/ Whose limbs thought for themselves/ Building
    casket after casket/ Lining warehouse shelves.""  The raging ""Not These Homes"" takes specific issue with the
    conflation of the Iraq invasion and the euphemistic War on Terror with this choice bit: ""The sky shivers/
    Not this time/ Not these homes/ A hundred buildings fall for two that once stood tall.""</p><p>
    
    It's not exactly the kind of thing that'll have them all over the Clear Channel affiliates, but one supposes
    they'd rather have it that way, given that they attack Clear Channel by name in impressive opener ""Delete
    False Culture"", Cinca exhorting his audience to ""delete Clear Channel"" in nearly with a paint-peeling
    scream in the song's frenzied coda.  The song is a heap of snapping guitar riffs, crunching bass and
    whiplash rhythms that actually plays host to low-key two-part harmonies in its opening verse, gradually
    building to Cinca's manic outbursts.  ""No Carrier"" follows with breakneck punk fury, the wiry guitars
    bordering on psychedelia and strange glitch-plagued backing vocals tumbling through the final verses.</p><p>
    
    Decahedron are also the rare post-hardcore band that's just as compelling at slow tempos as they are more
    pulse-quickening paces, and a handful of excellent slow songs here help to diversify the mix.  The instrumental
    ""Dislocation"" flows through passages of liquid guitar, while ""Every City Is a Prison""'s creeping harmonies
    and hornet clouds of guitar flow like oil slicks from bombed pipelines.  ""Pay No Mind"" layers Lally over
    tribal toms as Cinca's guitar stalks the background, framing lines like, ""Take these for anxiety/ Keeps the
    eyes content with the floor,"" with dread.</p><p>
<i>Disconnection Imminent</i> is a stunning debut, with a bit of filler as its only real fault.  Anyone
    intrigued by the names involved is apt to be pleased with the record, and fans still aching over Frodus'
    demise will certainly find consolation here.  Now if they could just add a couple of sides to that
    octagon...</p></div>"|2555.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2555-disconnection-imminent/|7.7|Joe Tangari

Just as
    viewers in 1990 asked who killed Laura Palmer, listeners in 1967 debated what the narrator and Billie Joe
    McAllister dropped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.  Was it a stillborn baby?  A murder weapon?  Drug paraphernalia?
    Was it her doll, as the 1976 movie version claimed?  Or was it, as writer Ron Carlson theorized in <i>The
    Oxford American</i>, our collective loss of innocence as the Vietnam War raged and a counterculture surged?
    Originally intended as a B-side to ""Mississippi Delta"", ""Ode to Billie Joe"" was an unlikely hit: With a
    decidedly Southern Gothic atmosphere, the song unfolds mostly at a dinner table, builds a mystery around
    the narrator's unspecified relationship with Billie Joe, and touches on suicide, home cooking, and the
    plight of rural farmers, as Gentry's guitar and Jimmie Haskell's strings swirl around the words like eddies
    in swampy southern creeks.</p><p>
    ""Ode to Billy Joe"" wasn't Gentry's only hit-- just the one that's still popular today, canonized by K-Tel
    and various cover versions both blatantly ironic and boringly sincere.  Shout! Factory's new collection,
    <i>Chickasaw County Child: The Artistry of Bobbie Gentry</i>, seeks to erase that one-hit-wonder stigma by
    emphasizing her dusky and dramatic voice, confident interpretation, and geographically and culturally
    specific songwriting, all of which combined to create a unique Deep South style.  By portraying her as a
    true artist and a legitimate contemporary of Dusty Springfield, Jessi Coulter, and even FraxE7oise Hardy,
    this collection intends to introduce Gentry to a new generation of listeners more familiar with the Black
    Lodge than Choctaw Ridge.</p><p>
    As a testament to her woodwind coo, <i>Chickasaw County Child</i> succeeds effortlessly: Deep and expressive,
    down-home yet sophisticated, Gentry's voice transcends the country label, which she earned in the late 60s,
    by incorporating a range of styles to put her songs across, from blues and folk to pop and rock and even a
    little mariachi on ""Beverly"".  However, as a collection of songs meant to showcase that voice, this collection
    proves more complicated and not quite revelatory.  Often, her vocal performance so far surpasses the material
    that the effect is unintentionally comical, like watching a great actor spout wooden lines.  Sometimes her
    songwriting veers too close to precious (""Bugs"") or Vegas smooth (""Marigolds and Tangerines"") or just plain
    weird (""Refractions""), and in retrospect, many of the songs here sound dated, their production too gimmicky
    and, by now, kitschy.  In other words, too many of the songs on <i>Chickasaw County Child</i> sound more
    like artifacts of the 70s than timeless art.</p><p>
    Discounting Gentry as outdated, however, is dangerous: Credited with all but two of the nearly two dozen
    tracks on <i>Chickasaw County Child</i>, she proves herself a smart, intuitive songwriter with a distinctive
    voice that incorporated childhood reminiscence to conceal rather than convey her autobiography.  There's a
    lot more of her life in these songs than the lyrics suggest-- and the lyrics suggest plenty.</p><p>
    Obviously, ""Mississippi Delta"" and ""Papa, Won't You Let Me Go to Town With You?"" draw from her childhood
    spent on her grandparents' rural farm, a nostalgia that lent her a marketable wholesomeness (despite the
    implied indiscretions of ""Ode to Billie Joe"").  As her celebrity grew with her early success, Gentry
    eventually turned her attention from Southern youth to a less geographically centered adulthood.
    Consequently, her songs became less overtly autobiographical, although she still plays the lead.  She may
    not be the title character of ""Fancy"", a poor girl who has no qualms about how she earned that ""Georgia
    mansion and an elegant New York flat,"" but she certainly identifies with her tough-mindedness.</p><p>
    Following her contribution to the 1974 movie <i>Macon County Line</i>, Gentry retired completely and (so
    far) permanently from performing, refusing to give concerts or interviews and declining offers to record
    or collaborate.  On the amazing ""Lookin' In"", the penultimate track on <i>Chickasaw County Child</i>, she
    describes her hectic routine: ""Laying in my hotel room wantin' to be alone/ Needin' the time to rest my
    mind/ But they bring in another stack of papers to sign/ And L.A.'s a-waitin' on the other line.""  The
    song contains all the information we need to understand her self-imposed exile, but just like ""Ode to
    Billie Joe"", the answers it gives only draw more questions.  Gentry promises confession in these songs,
    but she remains unknowable and irresolvable.  As <i>Chickasaw County Child</i> makes clear, her true
    artistry lies not in what she revealed through words and music, but what she kept hidden-- and what her
    songs continue to guard so closely today.</p></div>"|3422.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3422-chickasaw-county-child-the-artistry-of-bobbie-gentry/|8.0|Stephen M. Deusner

Since notoriously recording his first album from behind a fencing mask, Ghostface Killah has spent his     solo discography facing tracklisting errors, guest appearances from subpar MCs, and a quest for commercial     acceptance that's netted him exactly zero Top 40 singles.  It would seem high time for Coles to shrug off     label expectations, focus on pleasing his fanbase, and finally escape the spectre of his financial     shortcomings.</p>
<p>Where the solo releases of so many Wu-Tang alumni have suffered from lagging production, or seemed naked     without backup from fellow Clan members, Ghostface has managed to cultivate a unique sound and identity     apart from his former crew on the strength of his own technical merit.  Still among the rap game's finest,     Ghostface possesses one of history's most malleable flows: he growls, screams, sputters, speeds up,     stumbles, coos, whispers, croons, pleads, cries, and indulges in onomatopoeia-- sometimes all in the same     song.  Considering this distinct style, the quality of his albums has always been relative to his subject     matter.  Here, he assumes the role of <i>Do the Right Thing</i>'s Radio Raheem: one fist spells ""HATE"", the     other ""LOVE.""</p>
<p>""Beat the Clock""'s strings hit like a right hook, as producer Minnesota (best known for Mos Def's ""Beef"")     throws down an unchanging blaxploitation funk loop that keeps in line with the minimalist backing of     Ghost's best work.  Taking advantage of the open space, Ghost styles like crazy, arguing with himself     between verses and periodically switching to a sing-song cadence.  Quotables pop up all over the place     here-- from scenes that have him ""hopping over chairs like O.J."" to straight disses like ""get off my     D-I, then go C the K"")-- but the track's most stunning line has Ghost pushing opulence through the     creative threshold: ""I put my ring up to my man's waves/ I seen the ocean.""</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum is ""Save Me Dear"", a self-produced throwback sampling Ghostface's own     <i>Supreme Clientele</i> highlight ""Child's Play"" and Jam Master Jay's cavernous 808 beats, and bears     a surprisingly resemblance to MF Doom's recent work.  An open plea to womankind, Ghost offers a testament     to true thug love, asserting, ""We mad tight, in the way she never call the cops on a nigga,"" and rallying,     ""To all the ladies who love they man/ Though they fucked up and you still let 'em back in.""</p>
<p>Of course, as is customary with Wu rappers, Ghost sometimes makes missteps in the name of personal     preference.  There are cases in which Ghost allows his old-school heart and love for homage obscure     or detract from the quality of his music (or album cover-- witness the sad Photoshop hackjob paying     tribute to Doug E. Fresh's 1988 classic <i>The World's Greatest Entertainer</i>).  Yet, <i>The Pretty     Toney Album</i> remains incredibly on-target otherwise, with uniformly stunning production work that     feels like a ramshackle <i>Blueprint</i>.  From the short sample chop and four-bar horn flourish of     ""Be This Way"", to True Master's paused piano and fuzz saxophone drum stomp on ""Biscuits"", to the     fear-soaked, twisted-horn chase music of ""Run"", <i>Pretty Toney</i> evokes hip-hop's storied past     even while its polish and gloss reveal its 2004 release date.</p>
<p>Expectedly, minor shortcomings hold the record back from classic status.  The lack of his usual obligatory     Raekwon collaboration hurts <i>Pretty Toney</i>'s variety, and the skits, despite featuring topics and     idiosyncratic raps far above the standards of his contemporaries, tend to bog down the album's progress.     I'm also disappointed by the exclusion of mixtape tracks ""Gorilla Hood"", ""The Splash"", and ""My Guitar"",     which could have offered the record a better batting average.  But all things considered, <i>Pretty     Toney</i> far surpasses 2001's <i>Bulletproof Wallets</i>, finally finding the missing link between street     cred and commercial respect.</p></div>"|3636.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3636-the-pretty-toney-album/|8.2|Rollie Pemberton

    in a while you just have to do it because it makes sense.  In this case, what you see when you look at the
    packaging for the album is exactly what you get when you listen to it: a limited tonal palette, lots of
    wide-open space, and a decidedly minimalist approach.  It's probably kind of difficult to tell in tiny 72
    dpi, but the lines stretching across the bottom of the brown field are steel-wound guitar strings, whose
    vibrations are the source of all but two sounds on this CD.  It's also worth noting that the package itself
    is the signature slipcase of Australia's Room40 Records, a promising ambient-focused upstart with a highly
    distinctive visual calling card.</p><p>
    
    Frost consists solely of guitarist/soundscaper Ben Frost, and his approach to the instrument is more
    textural than harmonic or melodic.  He draws long sounds from the instrument, processing and layering to
    create a slowly swelling and morphing mass of shimmering icicle tones that hang in the air like wraiths of
    smoke.  It sounds especially great in the dark, as the waves of guitar echo around the room.</p><p>
    
    The first two compositions are both soft-edged swells, clouds of drones that rise and fall separately to
    build dozens of subtly different textures.  Stars of the Lid and Keith Fullerton Whitman have more or less
    perfected this approach, and Frost does a good job of it, crafting an enveloping haze.  The standout track,
    though, is ""You, Me and the End of Everything"", a languid ice flow built around a few sparsely plucked,
    heavily reverb-drenched guitar figures.  Vocalist Jane Wentzki provides color, often merging with the
    guitar as Frost chops her voice and distorts it, laying it between inky chords and long, wailing drones.
    It's ten minutes of pure phase aural bliss, a total bath for the senses.</p><p>
    
    The title track wounds as if it was recorded in an old stone castle, the way the sounds reverberate, but
    of course it's all artificial reverb.  Field recordings of crackling sounds and muffled voices lie deep
    in the frigid lake of feedback and string noise, but it seems clear that they're not really the focus of
    the piece, but rather a sort of measure taken to lend the listener a sense of place.  The album closes
    with two pieces that, despite failing to expand much on previous tracks, are nonetheless entirely agreeable.</p><p>
<i>Steel Wound</i> is an exemplary ambient experience, and another fine release from an intriguing young
    label.  The chilly textures Frost creates are easy to immerse yourself in, and even occasionally transcendent.
    Whether he can spin this approach into another album this interesting or moves on to something else only
    time will tell, but <i>Steel Wound</i> speaks well for itself in the meantime.</p></div>"|3277.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3277-steel-wound/|7.9|Joe Tangari

    work remixed by different producers.  Since the sonic character of a song belongs to the person who
    last had their fingers on the mouse, an album collecting a producer's remixes tends to flow better
    and possess something closer to a singular identity.</p><p>
    
    Over the last couple of years, Schneider TM's Dirk Dresselhaus has been a busy remixer, and now he's
    collected 12 of his remixes and collaborations on <i>Reconfigures</i>.  Schneider TM have developed
    a distinct sonic identity that typically includes vocodered vocals, bits of acoustic guitar, and the
    kind of squelchy electropop production that Germany made famous, and he's not shy about using his
    signature tricks to dress up another song.  So, immediately, the best thing this collection has going
    for it is that it works together as a record, with similar elements used in various configurations from
    track to track.  In other words, it sounds something like a Schneider TM album with a host of guest
    stars.</p><p>
    
    But the stars, well, they're shining pretty dim on <i>Reconfigures</i>.  The problem is that most of the
    songs just weren't that interesting to begin with, and though Dresselhaus does make the most of his source
    material, the limit to what can be done is apparent.  His version of Margo's ""Take Me"" is plodding
    electro-indie, with slightly interesting noises that nonetheless fail to raise the song to the level of
    a Sukpatch B-side.  His take on Lamb's ""Wonder"", in which he adds some backward drums to the light-gray
    gothic melody, breaks the rhythmic spine of the song, transforming it from merely dull to actively
    unpleasant.  The Faint's ""The Conductor"" gets some vocodered vocals and chunky beats, and probably
    wouldn't be terrible if I could stomach Todd Baechle's voice.  The collaboration ""Ephe Kicks In, Feel
    Like Kevin"" with K.pt.Michigan and Rechenzentrum, features Marc Marcovic on vocals trying to do Prince
    track (""When Doves Cry"" handclaps feature in the production) and coming away with a bad Beck impression
    instead.</p><p>
    
    On the bright side, the collaboration with Pulseprogramming ""Suck or Run"" is essentially a new (and rather
    good) Schneider TM song, as Dresselhaus layers his vocals and guitar over the squishy beat, with a
    faux-Stones lead on acoustic and bits of harmonica.  Ruby's ""Grace, Space"" has some fantastic wah-wah
    guitar that rises to the level of the most intricate hip-hop production, along with the classic-sounding
    soul vocals.  Lambchop's ""The New Cobweb Summer"" has an interesting ""broken"" quality that goes beyond
    the processing of Kurt Wagner's voice, too.  But ultimately, despite a few positive blips, <i>Reconfigures</i>
    fails even with the lowered expectations of a remix collection.</p></div>"|7030.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7030-reconfigures/|4.5|Mark Richardson

A scrappy duo of New York ne'er-do-wells, their struggle was rich
    with emotion and anger, siphoning ghetto struggle through El-P's fish-eye lens.  And then Vordul got his
    collarbone broken.  We stood behind Vast's questionable freestyles and guest appearances.  We even thought
    about buying his <i>Dirty Magazine</i> mixtape (until we downloaded it and wept).  Now, three years after
    <i>The Cold Vein</i> made them underground hip-hop's next big thing, comes Vast Aire's solo debut for
    Chocolate Industries, an awkward, inconsistent amalgam of wasted talent and musical apathy.</p><p>
    
    The magic behind Vast Aire's early work is almost intangible, considering that his vocal exterior consists
    of a hazy cadence, off-kilter flow, unrelenting repetition, and dependence on punch-ins.  But his stoic
    confidence was immediately compelling-- almost as much as his effortless control of metaphor.  But the
    Vast Aire that shows up on <i>Look Mom No Hands</i> is confusing and confused.  Here, his darts lack the
    sharpness of his <i>Cold Vein</i> cuts, and as he frames his tracks with lame choruses (""Saying his rhymes
    ain't fresh/ Is like saying Ted Koppel's toupee is okay""), there's nothing to counter his arrhythmic
    delivery.  Whether this lack of ambition results from Vordul's temporary departure or just a sudden
    comfort with his craft is uncertain; what isn't is that Vast Aire just doesn't sound hungry anymore.</p><p>
    
    There are a few moments in which Vast offers glimmers of hope, from the amusing back-and-forth of the MF
    Doom collab ""Da Supafriendz"" to the pleasant summer barbecue vibe of the obligatory R&amp;B; cut ""Viewtiful Flow"",
    but never is the promise of greatness more apparent than on ""Life's Ill Pt. II: The Empire Striketh"". Madlib's
    instrumental sounds like someone playing church organ in a spaceship's engine room, with Breeze Brewin
    ""writing dead sea scrolls,"" Vast juxtaposing <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> and <i>The Cold Vein</i>'s
    release date, and Vordul chastising ""half-comedians, not really soundin' funny.""  Unfortunately, these
    are the best of the lot, and on a 16-track outing, these brief diamonds can't overshadow the rough.</p><p>
    
    The production is a spotty affair as well, though it too has its moments.  On the upside, Rjd2 pours
    incredible strings and 70s bass atop the pointless Esoteric diss ""9 Lashes (When Michael Smacks Lucifer)""
    and Madlib contributes the suspended flute, recoiling horns and marching drums of the title track.  But
    for every ""Pegasus (Remix)"", there's an ""Elixir"" (which, by the way, sounds like something from an aborted
    Daz Dillinger/Erick Sermon compilation). This kind of inconsistency helps to illuminate Vast's lack of
    lyrical commitment throughout the album.</p><p>
    
    All said, even with Aesop Rock, Sadat X, Blueprint, Breeze Brewin, MF Doom and Vordul on the lineup, <i>Look
    Mom... No Hands</i> consistently fails to impress lyrically, or to convince fans that Vast's first solo
    venture is really the individual effort it purports to be.  Sure, he drops the occasional jewel (""The third
    movie of <i>The Matrix</i> was gonna be wack/ It ain't like I didn't care/ But the Oracle said 'spend your

    it's no surprise that Tom Recchion, in homage to titles like <i>Lumpy Gravy</i> and ""White Jam"", has called
    this record <i>I Love My Organ</i>.  <i>The Wire</i> suspected that the quote could be onanistic, but in
    the tradition of another off-his-axis ambient master, Erik Satie, it could as easily be in the tradition of
    that lost art of omphalism, meditating on one's own belly-button.</p><p>
    
    Self-absorbed, unaware of trends and times, and generally out of the loop, tape-splicer Recchion has existed
    in his own world since the mid-1970s, helping to found the bizarre Los Angeles Free Music Society-- which had
    connections to everyone from The Residents to Beefheart to Keiji Haino (still decades away from recognition
    outside of the Japanese underground)-- a collective that released their own records in DIY fashion before
    punk even hit.  Recchion even worked inside the system, designing Grammy-nominated album covers for R.E.M.
    and Prince along the way.</p><p>
<i>I Love My Organ</i> is Recchion's latest batch of kooky, newly unearthed tape improvisations to see
    release via Birdman Records, and judging from the material on display, its contents were created in some
    nondescript haze of the 80s.  As composed as they may appear to be, 11 of the record's 15 tracks are
    real-time improvisations, with Recchion jumping between unballasted tape loops with arrays of organs,
    strange exotica samples and homemade instruments.  The liner notes' dedications point to the middle ground
    it all inhabits, shouting out to horn-rimmed geeks like Ferrante &amp; Teicher and Jad Fair, as well as ambient
    gurus Terry Riley and Brian Eno.</p><p>
    
    For those already taken with the disintegrating tape loop majesty of Brooklyn composer William Basinski,
    Recchion's ""Narcotic"" (which is dedicated to him), shows a striking synchronicity of melancholic sound;
    it's the result of two musicians operating on two different coasts during the Reagan era, utterly unaware
    of the others' work.  Other pieces engage in exotic, obsolete rhythms from the rim of the memory hole:
    Imaginary Italian mod soundtracks and rhythms such as waltzes, calliopes and sambas paint each distinct
    meter as a woozy and wasted 3am ride on a destitute carousel.</p><p>
    
    The record finishes with an eerie whispered bit by David Toop, whose <i>Exotica</i> book was inspired by
    a handful of peculiar easy-listening mixtapes sent to him by Recchion.  The culminating, off-the-cuff
    results are as unsettling as a Martin Denny album cover as rendered by performance artist Paul McCarthy:
    a grass-skirted nymphet in a rubber Mister Rogers mask, blood on her feet.</p></div>"|6916.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6916-i-love-my-organ/|7.5|Andy Beta

    Francisco beat scientist DJ Zeph's sophomore release fights for the royal echelon of turntablism.  He must
    realize he's on the cusp of reaching a wider audience: <i>Sunset Scavenger</i> pulls out all stops.
    Forgoing previous experimentation for superior songcraft, the album is innovative and fresh, driven
    equally by Zeph's warm, deft sampling technique, his ear for tight composition, and the organic vibe
    brought by an array of prestigious guest artists.</p><p>
<i>Sunset Scavenger</i>, named for the perpetually busy Bay Area recycling and composting service, couldn't
    ask for a more apt title: It sifts through heaps of styles and moods, cleverly referencing classic themes
    while constructing an absorbing, purely original work from the bits and pieces.  From the live electro
    tabla breaks of ""Go Back"", to Zeph's pairing with DJ Quest on the Bukem-esque opener ""Unsubtractable"", to
    Rahsaan Ahmed's Kurtis Blow flow on the rollerdisco bounce of ""Floorwax"", this record spans the entire
    breakbeat landscape to stunning effect, using history as it building blocks and wrapping its MCs in a
    warm blanket of crackling vinyl and analog purr.</p><p>
    
    When huge, unmistakable personalities show up-- like The Coup's Boots Riley and a typically raucous Lyrics
    Born-- Zeph's seamless production one-ups that of his contemporaries by complimenting, rather than obstructing,
    his guests.  In fact, the music's luxurious, necksnapping immediacy itself takes on a personality of its
    own: That's live violin and cello on ""Underscore"", beautifully amplified to swelling, orchestral proportions.
    The percussive ""Organ Eyes"" pours syncopated Hammond atop live tabla and former Tower of Power drummer Ron
    Beck's ride and snare cracks; ""Sunset Samba"" braids live flute, trumpet, and a sizzling Brazilian rhythm.</p><p>
    
    These collaborations have Zeph exhibiting the malleability of an expert arranger and producer-- through
    his wholly sample-constructed pieces, he flexes all the vinyl jockey flash that's rocketed his live shows
    to must-see status.  The soul vocals on ""Raw B Interlude"" are cratedigging gold, resting against conga beats
    and jangly guitar that suggest Latin-flavored Bootsy bass.  ""Cormorant"", meanwhile, captures Zeph at his
    most downtempo, his low-key beat and intermittent guitar samples trickling beneath hip-hop poet Tim Barsky's
    urban spoken word fairy tale.</p><p>
    
    Zeph's allegiance to Asian breaks crew Dhamaal is evident in his consistent use of Eastern instruments.
    His employment of sitar, doumbek and tabla never revels in the instruments' indigenous exoticism; rather,
    he seems as comfortable with their unique sounds as he does with traditional American accompaniment, allowing
    them to lend rhythmic texture and diversity without any hint of the kind of world beat undercurrent that
    could so easily shut the party down.  Still, there is one misstep here, as the Dhamaal drummers are set
    free on an a cappella tabla/doumbek duel which, while fascinating, momentarily sends the album's continuity
    off its rails.</p><p>
    
    To call <i>Sunset Scavenger</i> a breakthrough would be appropriate if not for Zeph's long-running presence
    on the West Coast turntablist scene.  He's been creating music in this vein for more than a decade now, and
    while this is his most fully realized piece to date, it doesn't offer the same level of innovation that
    propelled his best-known predecessors to DJ superstardom.  Still, like Rjd2's <i>Deadringer</i>, that
    doesn't stop the record from overshadowing its competition as a solid state-of-the-genre release.</p></div>"|2393.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2393-sunset-scavenger/|7.9|Jonathan Zwickel

    onslaught that awaits.  Leaving the station via the Hachiko exit reveals a piercing overload of blinking
    neon, tennis court-sized media screens, and a relentless and chaotic surge of humanity through the streets
    that spiral dizzyingly off into the horizon.  As a city gripped by paroxysms of furious activity, Tokyo
    seems to be a very reasonable home for the spasmodic, psychotic hardcore of Melt-Banana.  And if you've
    spent a little time in the world's most baffling metropolis, this reissue of the equally startling
    tech-punk classic <i>Scratch or Snitch</i> should resonate with familiarity.</p><p>
    Melt-Banana are not the only purveyors of excess to emerge from Japan, but like spiritual brethren Boredoms
    and Ruins, their best releases stand as a testament to the power that a well-produced and inventive punk
    band can command with focus, technical prowess, and sick levels of ambition.  Heavyweight Chicago auteurs
    Steve Albini and Jim O'Rourke recorded and mixed this 22-track, half-hour punk rocker back in 1995.  The
    presence of two of the industry's most respected creative technicians infused this energetic four-piece
    with a shot of credibility that, in light of this band's musicianship, almost seems gratuitous.  Evidently,
    nothing so drastic as a remastering was ever going to be needed for this repressing.</p><p>
    When forming Melt-Banana, Yasuko Onuki tore through ranks of personnel, finally settling with the guitar
    and bass duo of Agata and Rika, who provide electro-convulsive therapy to compliment Onuki's rapid-fire
    Japanese pop-culture musings.  Her search paid off: The maelstrom that ensues here is never less than
    impeccably rendered-- one of the most coherent and illustrative recordings of the notoriously sloppy punk
    genre.  ""Rough Dogs Have Bumps"" shows Melt-Banana in full control of an adrenaline-heavy hardcore frenzy
    that twists Heavy Metal guitar clichés into a delirious romp.  Nonsensical as they predominately are,
    Onuki's frenetic utterances slice through the mix, setting the band on a jagged path fraught with hysteria
    and anger.  Each instrument twitches fervently yet clearly in the expert mix that evokes Tokyo's busy
    streets: crammed with activity, yet immaculately litter-free.</p><p>
<i>Scratch or Stitch</i>'s track titles blare like the advertising slogans and brand name nonsense flashing
    on Osaka's electrical billboards.  ""DIG Out!"", ""DisPosable Weathercock"" and ""BuZZer #P"" combine a parody of
    pop culture with a lively humor that sits well with the delirium of their contents.  The 1\xBD-minute average
    track length echoes shortening attention spans precipitated by the quick-fire editing of youth culture TV,
    while Melt-Banana play with Japan's preoccupation with elaborate packaging and presentation by building
    layers of sound before ripping them to burning shreds as Onuki gleefully narrates their
    demise.</p><p>
    22 tracks might seem a bit ambitious, even for such an inventive and technically varied act, but then,
    hardcore punk is an ordeal at the best of times.  The inclusion of the stunted 10- and 20-second
    ""TYPe B for Me"" and ""A Finger to Hackle"" (amongst other sub-minute explosions) does something to punctuate
    and shape the record, but tracks tend to bleed into one another, the quirky titles being all that separate
    the likes of ""It's in the PillcaSe"" and ""Sick ZiP Everywhere"".  Thankfully, Melt-Banana do have a healthier
    than usual tendency toward riveting experimentation, judging by the torture chamber soundscape of ""EYE-Q
    Trader"" and the lycanthropic transformation from gentle to rabid in ""Back to the WomB"".</p><p>
<i>Scratch or Stitch</i> sits among subsequent Melt-Banana releases with an air of superiority.  Although
    influences and comparisons are not difficult to find, it's a mistake to bundle this album into any anonymous
    hardcore classification.  What you're listening to may seem to be sensationalist and carnal, but that belies
    the album's wry center, steeped in cultural exposure.  Hardcore?  This release is Tokyo-core, and looking
    out across this sleepless behemoth of commerce, there's nothing accelerated or excessive about it.</p></div>"|5219.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5219-scratch-or-stitch/|8.2|Dan Lett

    her more formidable likeness is homestate neo-powerhouse Norah Jones: No matter how boring
    or stupidly inconsequential Jones' records may be, Jones has proven herself one of the most unexpected
    new forces in pop, forgoing the seemingly predictable pop landscape in 2002 and single-handedly exposing
    a new, painfully untapped market of cocktail-partying music-buyers.  Thus, witness the aftermath: Now,
    plucky Jolie Holland has to contend with a new, post-Jones landscape, wherein slow, salty coos have become
    alarmingly ubiquitous, and a female singing scrappy, country-tinged jazz is forever linked with a
    Borders-shopping, latte-drinking, Nantucket-summering herd of yuppies.</p><p>
    
    Like Jones, Holland produces her own records, and plays several instruments (guitar, piano, ukulele), but
    Holland also single-handedly scribes all of her own material, injecting a healthy bit of confessionalism
    into her lyrics (see Sascha's ""I fell in love with a boy/ Who has a real life romance with a train"")
    whereas Jones' quips tend to fall embarrassingly flat, each verse impossibly lifeless and smooth.  This
    is, ultimately, where Holland exceeds most notably-- her vaguely gothic cautionary tales and lovelorn
    laments are always strikingly personal and passionately rendered, with traditional arrangements, heated
    narratives, and sprays of big Texas spark gently folded in.</p><p>
    
    Holland's pipes are dynamic enough to suit a variety of vocal styles, and <i>Escondida</i>, Holland's second
    full-length (and her first not culled from demos), boldly embraces an entire handful of tried American genres,
    her voice often flitting from country-rock twang to frantic crooner scats, or brazenly hopping from sultry,
    neo-beat jazz whispers (see repeated references to ""Billy Burroughs"") to benign singer/songwriter musing.
    Leaving little room for speculation, Holland repeatedly assures us that, yes, she can sing it-- and while
    self-diversifying is a perfectly acceptable (and sometimes glorious) approach to recording a fully realized,
    internally cohesive album, Holland's scope periodically makes <i>Escondida</i> appear non-committal and/or
    scattered.  Thus, the record occasionally becomes the sonic equivalent of playing dress-up or signing up
    for seventeen youth sports leagues-- and there are only so many hat-changes an audience can faithfully
    endure.</p><p>
    
    But all fickleness aside, <i>Escondida</i> still offers a spooky, blues-driven platter of jazz-folk, with
    plenty of interesting-- if vaguely predictable-- melodic turns.  The guitars-and-cymbals-only ""Black Stars""
    is a spare and prickly incantation, while ""Goodbye California"", which sounds as though it's being sung
    by a woman with a rubber mouth, putters proudly, an epic road story.  Holland refers to standout ""Old
    Fashioned Morphine"" as a ""bastard hybrid"" of Old Time Religion and Willie Johnson's take on ""Wade in the
    Water"" (Holland also includes a hilarious-if-ridiculous cautionary blurb in the liner notes: ""I wrote this...
    in the midst of a meditation on the history of medicine.  I'm certainly not encouraging anyone to fuck up
    their life""), but it's hard to dub the slithering, layered track anything but her very own.</p><p>
    
    Jolie Holland is well-armed to fight off detractors ready to dismiss her efforts as Jones-fallout, and
    perfectly equipped to counterattack all those currently assuming her songs are listless imitations of an
    already watery phenomenon.  And while Holland will probably never see Jones-size success, she's still
    working out her own path-- and the end looks promising. </p></div>"|3981.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3981-escondida/|7.0|Amanda Petrusich

You've put off reviewing this record
    for weeks; left it at the back of your mind while trembling through this stubborn, clinging winter.  When
    you're staring at a sick-note sun that only appears through breaks in the black clouds; with waves of rain
    that harass you on the slow trudge home, the last sound you want to hear is some twee-pop poem about daybreak
    in Santa Monica.  I have Joy Division box sets for days like these; do I need to listen to Sandy fucking
    Denny?</p><p>
    
    Which is lazy-assed journalism: Why should sunshine dictate whether a record's great or not?  Shouldn't the
    hardened rock hack, given a gram of coke and a poisoned pen, carve out some scene-stealing review of <i>Pet
    Sounds</i> even in the cold grip of a nuclear winter?  Maybe.  But maybe half the trick of music journalism
    is empathy; of leaving yourself open to the blues and moods that shaped the sounds under your radar.  How
    can you say if an album's any good if you can't even tell where it's coming from?</p><p>
    
    But then, maybe some albums just aren't worth the effort.  Being the coy-voiced, synth-fiddling, fair-haired
    minstrel behind both The Essex Green and Ladybug Transistor, in recent years Finishing School's Sasha Bell
    has lent her lemon-scent vocals to some divinely arranged, pillow-soft 60s pop. However, when removed from
    the cynicism and nosebled sincerity that stopped such projects from simply being a bore of psychedelic
    pastiche, her first solo outing seems like a rash of formulaic sweetness, without the strength of song to
    see it through.</p><p>
    
    Too often on ""Destination Girl"", Bell revels in by-numbers arrangements.  Take how opening track ""Reno""
    surprises no one with its cushion of cheap synths, baroque strings, spiked surf-guitar, go-nowhere lyrics
    and Bell's off-key, adolescent croon-- and proceeds to repeat the formula throughout the rest of the record.
    All of this would be less jarring if her melodies had the kind buoyant, sunlit gleam as her other projects;
    but here they seem weightless, drab, and lacking the sparks of grace and passion that permeated the last
    Ladybug album.</p><p>
    
    Despite its damning flaws, there's still a strange charm to this record.  At her best, Sasha Bell's songs
    are like a schoolgirl crush; listen to the ditzy love-stung waltz of the title track (""I feel like somebody
    you wouldn't even look at twice""), or when her keyboard line mimics the heartbeat flutter of a melody on
    ""Morning Light"",' and you find that however frustrating this record may be, some of these homemade reveries
    still have a genuinely touching warmth about them.</p><p>
    
    Sunshine or not, what we're left with is an album of mixed fortunes; at once graceful, passive, charming
    and sunburnt, it is also plagued with a predictability and deficiency of ideas that drag it into a mediocre,
    self-repeating quagmire.  It's hard to talk about records when they can't even cast a shadow.  Sometimes
    you've just got to draw the lines yourself.</p></div>"|3289.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3289-destination-girl/|5.9|Neil Robertson

Seen from the outside, its propulsive rhythms and improvisational swagger could only     signal an uneducated turn away from the staid, swollen rigidity of the Classics.  Jazz moved forward anyway,     its forebears far surpassing the creative limitations imposed by a shortsighted public and pushing the     limits of music.  But they were both right, the squares and the swingers: Jazz was dangerous music, and     for an extended golden era, its impassioned bite and mutant beauty illuminated the musical landscape.     Then, in the 1980s (how many bummer sentences start with that phrase?), we got Wynton, a man who rose to     national acclaim by sucking all the innovation and risk from the music founded on innovation and risk,     and it's been an uphill battle to regain jazz's vigor and progressive approach ever since.</p>
<p>For the past 15 years or so, ground zero has been the stylistic incubator of downtown NYC.  Progressive     luminaries like John Zorn, Marc Ribot, and MMW were all weaned on the City's well-informed, uberhip teat,     and they've brought truly challenging, thrilling new music to an adoring fanbase.  A staple of this downtown     scene for years, Josh Roseman was one of the founders of acid jazz goliaths Groove Collective and has toured     with artists like MMW and Soulive and jazz heavies Dave Douglas and Dave Holland.  On his first album, 2001's     <i>Cherry</i>, Roseman was a virtuoso showing on a variety of pop covers and weakish originals, impressive     though never outstanding.  His follow-up, however, delivers a potent, smoldering statement that harkens     back to jazz's headiest days.</p>
<p>Roseman starts off <i>Treats for the Nightwalker</i> on the right foot by surrounding himself with some of     today's best and brightest.  Besides Roseman's lyrical trombone, the lineup also features Hieroglyphics     Ensemble leader Peter Apfelbaum on organ, flute and sax, and guitarists Ben Monder and Liberty Ellman, while     the rhythm section features Dave Holland Quintet's Billy Kilson on drums and Patrice Blanchard's understated     bass. This underground all-star ensemble succeeds because, despite individual pedigree, it's bound into a     tight, multi-layered <i>Bitches Brew</i>-esque knot.  As the album winds through a boldly diverse array of     styles, Roseman picks his players to suit the song, but the dense, sinuous sound remains consistent.  Roseman's     major triumph here is in focusing a whole slew of genres-- free jazz, funk, hip-hop, dub, world beat, pop,     psychedelia-- through his own interpretive lens and projecting a completely cohesive, original sound.</p>
<p>Swirling compositions like the Far-eastern, prog-rocking ""Prospect"" and the ethereal, sensuous title track     are more ideas in motion than static songs; they're not sketches, per se, but slowly unfolding mysteries.     Along the way we encounter effects-smudged trombone, wah-wah guitar, muted trumpet, and hypnotic bass.     Burt Bacharach's ""Long Day, Short Night"" receives a heavy-lidded dub treatment that easily bounces into     a swinging ska breakdown, but its chorus retains the original's grand, showtunish grace.  The handclaps     and Hammond opening ""Meera"" give the song a frantic, <i>On the Corner</i> feel, but electronic effects     along with Diego Voglino's breakbeat drums and Jay Rodrigues' bass clarinet add a buoyant futurefunk     drive.  ""Regression"", flecked with sampled birdsong and underscored by Jon Maron's throbbing bass,     brightens slowly like an island sunrise.</p>
<p>With several numbers stretching past the ten-minute mark, these songs travel far before resolving and pass     through a variety of structures and moods, yet Roseman's joyful, surprising arrangements always keeps them     interesting.  Length, however, is the album's weak spot.  It's tough to swallow 71 minutes of music so     thick and compositions so vast.  Like a lot of epic fusion and soul-jazz albums of the 70s, <i>Treats</i> could benefit from one less song.  Too much of a good thing is still a good thing, but Roseman's point     would be far more effective if it were just a bit more succinct.</p></div>"|6915.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6915-treats-for-the-nightwalker/|7.2|Jonathan Zwickel

    guitar picks up and Avey Tare and Panda Bear's voices flail like children who know they'll never die,
    it occurs to me that youth isn't always wasted on the young.  This is an old cliché, about how kids can
    never really appreciate the finer aspects of immaturity-- in fact, it's their immaturity and naiveté that
    all the gray adults crave like zombies.  It's a child's lack of self-conscience and ""common sense"" that
    make them holy, just as it's an adult's knowledge of their own mortality that makes them a little bit dead.
    However, even if the sickly, aching adults might long for days spent wasting precious time and forgetting
    precious lessons, most of them wouldn't turn back the clock if given the chance.  Youth isn't wasted on
    the young at all, because only kids on holiday could afford to leave their hearts exposed for so long,
    to sing as loudly and to take so much for granted.  Rather, wisdom is wasted on the old.</p><p>
    Since their first release, Brooklyn's Animal Collective have soundtracked the surreal, manic experience
    of ""immature"" euphoria.  In fact, the Tare/Bear duo responsible for <i>Sung Tongs</i> is the same that
    issued 2000's <i>Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished</i>, a singular, idiosyncratic take on fairy
    tale folk and starchild pop.  Fairy tales and star-children: These are impressions of 'The Beyond' for
    imaginative children, and it's this mentality that Animal Collective explore and evoke.  It might seem
    whimsical or silly, but only in the sense that these perceptions are the birthrights of all children, and
    this band have such facility with their musical environment that they manage to turn something primal into
    something almost timeless.  Rather, grace is wasted on the elegant.</p><p>
    Unlike last year's impressive <i>Here Comes the Indian</i>, <i>Sung Tongs</i> opts for folky ambience
    and late-night, summer camp sing-alongs to carry the weight (or weightlessness) of its strains.
    <i>Campfire Songs</i>, which followed <i>Here Comes the Indian</i>, suggested a similar kind of sprawling,
    communal minstrel-craft, but without much of <i>Sung Tongs</i>' flair for soaring melody and delicate,
    buoyant pace.  As it happens, the last third of the new record does return to more of an open-ended,
    exploratory rote, but there it seems less a part of an endless ballad than the come-down from scenes of
    a jungle almost too fantastic to imagine.  And despite its eclecticism and relatively Dadaist leanings,
    <i>Sung Tongs</i> is a romantic album; romantic in its celebration of innocence and nonsensical shared
    knowledge, and the sweet, trusted idea that everything will be fine-- as if it hadn't always been.</p><p>
    Musically, Animal Collective sound more ""pop"" here than they ever have, which is to say most of the songs
    have clear melodies that beg to be doubled and tripled by you or anyone else who cares to join.  In songs
    like ""Leaf House"", ""Winters Love"" and ""College"", the duo stake a direct claim to the ideal American folk
    of the Beach Boys and Simon &amp; Garfunkel, as their harmonies are pure, without suggesting perfection.  As
    Tare and Bear leap over each other in wordless, sparkler-trail counterpoint, I think about the already-gone
    ambitions of ""Cabinessence"" and <i>Smiley Smile</i>.  However, as Brian Wilson's visions were damaged
    symphonies to god, Animal Collective don't stop down long enough to mire in the dust left behind.</p><p>
    ""Who Could Win a Rabbit"" revels in a thousand parts of some giant timepiece, as the pair of delirious
    children slide over screws into a bright green den of gears.  The acoustic guitar rings in the start of
    this race with a fanfare, major chord strum, and just after the chimes cheer in pandemonium, harmony
    vocals spit out as many syllables as possible to describe who knows what country fair, bread-and-butter
    game.  Sometimes their voices cross, or fly so near each other for long stretches that what seems like
    intricate polyphony approaches unhinged, acrobatic maneuvering.  Above all, a sense of overwhelming
    happiness at having discovered this strange place abounds.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, the music is more reflective.  ""The Softest Voice"" layers clear-toned guitar figures upon each
    other, as Tare and Bear whisper in harmony above, as if singing to the vision peering back at them from
    the skin of a backwoods creek.  The rustic, secretive manner of their voices and the barely disturbed
    forest around them suggests that whatever ghosts inhabit these woods are only too happy to oblige a
    lullaby or two.  Likewise, the epic ""Visiting Friends"" gathers in faceless, mutated ghosts (i.e., oddly
    manipulated vocalizations from the duo) to hover over their dying fire in visage of nothing better than
    the tops of trees.  The constant strumming moves alongside the voices, helping to keep them afloat, but
    never suggesting they should organize themselves into anything recognizable or predictable.  It's windy,
    and if it rains they'll get wet and continue to play.</p><p>
    The ritual dance ""We Tigers"", passing like a pagan baptism for children in war paint, gives way to a
    trilogy of almost formless ballads, beginning with the erratic hymn ""Mouth Wooed Her"".  Here, Animal
    Collective, no longer satisfied to keep their enthusiasm in check via tribal drums or faintly Brazilian
    guitar figures, glide through scenes with impressionistic glee.  Wordless coos and birdcalls light up
    the song, and the pair eases into their narrative with wispy, echoed melodies, before running into each
    other headfirst and pouncing on their guitars like real savages.  This is how <i>Sung Tongs</i> communicates;
    in place of organized chaos, there are chance meetings and reunions, and plenty of celebratory dances and
    momentary epiphanies.  In truth, it may be too much for some people to take, especially if they're too far
    removed from this strange environment.  For others, it's a wonderful place, as these guides know only too
    well.</p></div>"|191.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/191-sung-tongs/|8.9|Dominique Leone

    to a legendary Abbott &amp; Costello routine, or cause you to erupt into a fit of impassioned violence.  But its
    pun potential aside, On the Speakers is a ho-hum name for a group-- characterless and unevocative, not to
    mention a bit awkward to use alongside other prepositions (see below).  The foursome behind the name, which
    includes former Creeper Lagoon frontman Ian Sefchick, barely transcends this nomenclatural blandness: On the
    Speakers seem to have few ambitions beyond picking up where Creeper Lagoon's final album, 2001's <i>Take Back
    the Universe and Give Me Yesterday</i>, left off.  Their self-titled debut EP, which was originally released
    in late 2003 by San Francisco's 17 Reasons label, features the same type of self-effacing loser's anthems
    Sefchick wrote with his former band, along with the same chiming guitars and big-drama choruses.</p><p>
    
    While the songs are unsurprising as a general rule, there are some not-so-guilty pleasures on <i>On the
    Speakers</i> (see?).  Dan Horne's bass trips along on ""Share Your Self"", never content to settle for playing
    either rhythm section or melody, but trying to straddle both.  And Sefchick still has an admirable talent
    for investing obtuse or unoriginal lyrics with actual sincerity.  ""The heart is just a muscle,"" he observes
    wryly on ""Could I Be Right"" (perhaps unwittingly referencing a similar line from Clem Snide's song ""Exercise"",
    from 2000's <i>Your Favorite Music</i>).  And on the workplace love song ""Click Your Heels"", he counsels,
    ""It's alright to be female,"" before asking, ""Are you the pawn of love or the king of discipline?""  Somehow,
    he manages to make these lyrics sound like dares rather than whines.</p><p>
    
    The problem with On the Speakers, however, is the overfamiliarity of Sefchick's songwriting formula.  He
    begins with a fairly subdued verse backed by the interplay of immaculate guitars, then-- dependable as
    clockwork-- he launches into an anthemic chorus that comes down like a wrecking ball.  Sometimes this
    trajectory from small to big, from club venue to arena, fits the songs naturally and perfectly.  The
    first (and best) track, ""Could I Be Right"", tinkers with this formula by adding a catchy lead-in to the
    chorus, and the final song, ""Dance Crazy"", promisingly expresses a deep, sober-voiced anomie as Sefchick
    sounds genuinely addled by war-time paranoia and uncertainty.</p><p>
    
    But the four songs that separate these two tracks rely too heavily on Sefchick's cookie-cutter song structures,
    each one indulging in a sweeping chorus about one minute and fifteen seconds in.  This constant reiteration
    not only renders each track indistinct from the others, but breeds an unimaginative predictability that
    increasingly dilutes the songs' cumulative effect.  As a result, <i>On the Speakers</i> sounds repetitive
    at a mere six songs, and On the Speakers barely skirt redundancy themselves.</p><p>
    
    At the same time, these songs reveal a relatively new band still working on building a distinct, dynamic
    identity.  As they prove with the catchy melodies of ""Could I Be Right"" and the unexpected topicality of
    ""Dance Crazy"", On the Speakers sound best when they're willing to risk something, which suggests that they
    have all the elements to live up to-- or live down-- their name.</p></div>"|6096.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6096-on-the-speakers-ep/|5.8|Stephen M. Deusner

    (second stateside), there's a rather amateur photograph of some far-off cows grazing in a wide, open
    plain.  The plain's location is indeterminate-- it could be in Israel, or the U.S., or any number of
    other places-- but what interests me more than the plain is the clouds above it.  Really, I gave them
    no second thought until I looked at the booklet stowed within the outer casing, which uses two blown-up
    portions of the rear cover photo-- the thing is that when you open the booklet and view the front and back
    together, the two sections blend seamlessly as though they were one contiguous image, an impossibility
    since in the actual, full photograph, the section of the image that appears on the left is actually on
    the right.</p><p>
    
    Why am I ranting about this?  Honestly, I have little reason beyond the fact that it just struck me that
    somebody took the time to doctor these two details of a single photograph and serve them up as something
    new, probably knowing full well that almost nobody would notice it.  I suppose I also mention it because
    it's the sort of double-take detail that Rockfour build their music on.  The album that introduced them
    to American audiences, 2002's <i>Another Beginning</i>, was loaded with left turns and deceptive
    juxtapositions like that, and also happens to be one of the most enjoyable tributes to 1968 I've heard
    in ages.  Two years later, with <i>Nationwide</i>, they seem poised to equal and perhaps surpass that
    album, but run out of steam before they get the chance.</p><p>
    
    The album opens with a trio of knockout tunes spiked with 12-string jangle nicked from Roger McGuinn and
    honeyed harmonies.  ""Honey"" immediately strikes a darker tone for the album with its midtempo pound and
    lyrics that sound innocent enough until you realize that, ""You call her honey/ She gets in the car,"" details
    an encounter with a prostitute.  The title track is a rambunctious landslide of bouncing rhythm and thick
    harmony, highlighted by a warped guitar break that sounds beamed into the middle of the song from another
    planet, while ""Next Monroe"" drapes a sad minor melody over a dramatic chord progression.  The problem is
    that, after this impressive opening salvo, the guns are only on target about half the time.</p><p>
    
    Part of the problem is that the band has largely left behind the fun 'n' frenzy of their earlier material
    in an attempt to add a heavier, more serious edge to their sound, an entirely unnecessary exercise.  ""To
    the End"" has a wonderfully Lennon-esque melody, but the music underneath just thrashes with no center of
    gravity, finally coughing up an absurdly indulgent guitar solo.  ""Mad Routine"" finds more success with the
    fuzzier, more brutish take on the band's sound due to its propulsive rhythm and oozing hot glue melody,
    but the band muddies up ""You Said"" and ""Crush on Subtitles"" with too much distortion and rhythmic
    homogeneity.</p><p>
    
    So while Rockfour have bulked their sound up with roomfuls of steroidal guitar pedals, they've also
    sacrificed some of the character and attention to detail that they built their name on.  They can still
    kick out a melody with the best of them, but the slight update they've attempted has a tendency to load
    their songs down with too much dead weight.  The occasions where they get it right are sublime, but
    <i>Another Beginning</i> hits it out of the park every time and remains the best introduction to the
    band.</p></div>"|6817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6817-nationwide/|7.1|Joe Tangari

    Sbarro employees to former Diamondback Efrain Valdez.  The verdict is unanimous, transcending race, creed,
    and musical preference: <i>Kill Bill, Vol. 2</i> is no match for <i>Vol. 1</i>.  Curiously, though, this
    seems to be through no fault of <i>Vol. 2</i>'s.  People just seem to feel that comparing the two is as
    ludicrous as comparing a typhoon to the Sistine Chapel.  In fact, most of my queries concluded with
    condescension or confusion.  As one city clerk put it, ""You want me to do what now?""</p><p>
    
    It's no wonder people prefer the exhilarating thrust and groove of <i>Vol. 1</i>.  Tarantino's world is one
    that thrives on thrashing swiftness and attention deficit disorders.  And he works in a culture where entire
    residential areas are paved in neon lights, and anyone that goes the speed limit is labeled an effete bore
    or a terrorist.  But the actual reason for this universal preference is more ambiguous.  For every claim
    that ""the <i>Vol. 1</i> soundtrack is faster, sort of catchier,"" you'll catch a brief, addled grimace, a
    mark of uncertainty.</p><p>
    
    How can you possibly compare the two halves of this film, regardless of whether you derided or adored them?
    The first is all blustering, epileptogenic havoc; the second explores the first volume's motivation, history,
    and identity.  And if it's a bit slow-going, it's because the creases in the characters' faces took a while to form.  So do the soundtracks mirror this relationship?  Does the <i>Vol. 2</i> soundtrack redress
    <i>Vol. 1</i>'s pop euphoria, and try to instill a little culture and history through the same musicians
    and characters?  Does this explain the recurrence of certain artists-- Charlie Feathers, Meiko Kaji, Luis
    Bacalov, and Ennio Morricone?  Of fucking course not, you pompous shit.  Let's axe this disc like it ain't
    got no kids:</p><p>
    
    Any fears are swiftly squelched with Shivaree's opening ""Goodnight Moon"", a skulking ooze that slinks down
    the stairs and leaps to the floor, part innocent, haunted-house shiver and part libidinous excess: ""There's
    a blade by the bed/ And a phone in my hand/ A dog on the floor/ And some cash on the nightstand.""  It's as
    intoxicating and drenched in blood/sex/sweat as a three-minute Corona commercial.  The broiling lust and
    loss is continued in Charlie Feathers' ""Can't Hardly Stand It"".  Feathers basically made his entire career
    out of sounding like he was always endlessly and exquisitely enjoying a total mental and physical breakdown,
    and this song might be his climax: a limping, slashed voice punctuated by incredible, stinging gasps for
    air.  It's as downtrodden and chilling as anything I've heard recently, with the possible exception of a
    full choir of Spanish children singing mass-- which happens to constitute the soundtrack's next torrid
    track.</p><p>
    
    But the absolute masterpiece is Morricone's ""L'Arena"", an ode to pernicious anticipation that surrounds
    itself in bizarre, contorted construction sounds, like dirt being thrown over a grave.  Whistling and brass
    is torn between elegy and celebration, while an effervescent choir sings a rain dance of noxious beauty.
    It's the kind of piece you can't listen to very frequently because you'll never want to do anything else
    again. The only possible competition lies in another Morricone dervish, the indefatigable ""A Silhouette
    of Doom"".  Every single instrument here is played to its full capacity-- pianos are stomped, trumpets are
    excoriated, and guitars are brandished in a strangulating combination of Indian warcry, Hitchcockian dread,
    dog whistle, and recycling plant.</p><p>
    
    There's really only one lonely misstep: Malcolm McLaren's preposterous ""About Her"", which is, literally, a
    trip-hop Zombies classic.  The bigger issue, however, lies with the sequencing.  For the most part, Tarantino
    seemed to have little idea of how to match his song choices with the film's scenes.  Johnny Cash's slow
    death, ""A Satisfied Mind"", is given a few brief moments on Budd's stereo, while two of the best songs ever--
    Morricone's <i>Fistful of Dollars</i> and <i>Navajo Joe</i> themes (neither of which are represented on
    either of the two soundtracks)-- are given hardly any coherent visual accompaniment.</p><p>
    
    Likewise, Tarantino doesn't seem to have put much thought into how to represent the songs on this release.
    <i>Vol. 1</i> offered a much more cohesive listen, with all sorts of elaborate connections between its
    songs: Bacalov's scalding Santa Ana winds segued into the Twisted Nerve whistle; Issac Hayes's militaristic
    snare whirled into Al Hirt's ""Green Hornet Theme"", etc.  But <i>Kill Bill, Vol. 2</i> simply doesn't make
    any sense; despite the quality of these tracks, the disc plays like a blur of arbitrary inclusions, more
    like a Sunday afternoon college radio DJ than any of the soundtrack releases that have made Tarantino as
    respected a music archivist as he is a director.</p></div>"|7888.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7888-kill-bill-vol-2/|8.2|Alex Linhardt

Born in a Kentucky mining town called Butcher Hollow, a teenage bride and a mother     several times over before she even arrived in Nashville, Lynn sang with a hill-country accent (notably     different from typical Music Row stars) and with the unchecked candor of her toughening experiences.     In this smoothly defiant voice, she sang of her man's and her own cheating ways, as well as the hardships     of motherhood, wifehood, and celebrity as if each were one and the same-- and they probably were.</p>
<p>In Nashville, she was a rough in the diamond: Her hard-edged songs like ""Fist City"" and ""Rated X"" were     backed by pristine countrypolitan production-- mostly courtesy of Owen Bradley-- which helped sell her     to a wide audience.  At the same time, the disparity between her voice and her accompaniment created a     fascinating rural/urban friction that never let listeners forget that she was less a superstar than a     small-town girl at heart.  Crucial to her image and her success, the depth of Lynn's noncelebrity is     perhaps why her old material still bristles and burrs even today.</p>
<p>On her new album, <i>Van Lear Rose</i>, producer and admirer Jack White (who dedicated <i>White Blood     Cells</i> to Lynn in 2001) immediately erases that friction with a rawer, in-one-take live sound that     adds texture to her songs without overpowering her voice.  White's intention isn't to update or revise     Lynn's music or her persona, but simply to recast her voice in a new setting, to make her sound like she's     right back in Butcher Hollow.</p>
<p>To this end, White has corralled a backing band that consists not of Nashville veterans, but of young 'uns     from the decidedly non-rural locales of Detroit and Cincinnati.  Dubbed the Do Whaters by Lynn (""I named     them that because they got in there and did whatever we needed them to!"" she explains in the liner notes),     the group consists of The Greenhornes' rhythm section Jack Lawrence and Patrick Keeler, with Blanche's Dave     Feeny adding elegant pedal steel and slide guitar flourishes.  Together, they prove a dynamic backing band,     able to set a warm country atmosphere but not afraid to make some rock noise.</p>
<p>And they do just that on the first single, ""Portland, Oregon"".  Lynn and White exchange verses about sloe     gin fizzes and drunk lovin', recalling her adultery duets with Conway Twitty but with more of a boisterous     sound, courtesy of White's Zep blues riffs. On ""Mrs. Leroy Brown"", the band bang out a bar-stormer to match     Lynn's adventures riding around town in a pink limousine.  Even bigger than that limo, though, is the     unmistakable smile on her face as she disses her man and his floozy: ""I just drawed all your money out of     the bank today/ Honey, you don't have no mo'.""</p>
<p>If <i>Van Lear Rose</i> recasts Lynn's sound, it also revisits the subject matter of her earlier hits,     following her stories through to their sometimes dire ends in songs like ""Women's Prison"" and ""Family     Tree"".  But on the album's most memorable songs, Lynn tells her own story, singing in no other voice     but her own, and it still soars with surprising grace and with all the sass and intimacy of her younger     self.  Most of <i>Van Lear Rose</i> is autobiographical, relating her life in both Butcher Hollow and     Nashville with evocative detail and steady candor.  The title track, for example, recalls her father's     stories about her mother and ""how her beauty ran deep down to her soul.""  Her voice trembles with a tender,     nostalgic wistfulness, especially when she remembers how the miners teased her dad: ""You're dreamin', boy,     she'll never look your way/ You'll never ever hold the Van Lear Rose.""</p>
<p>After the spoken-word reminiscence ""Little Red Shoes"" and the devastating widow's lament ""Miss Being Mrs."",     <i>Van Lear Rose</i> ends with ""Story of My Life"", which is exactly what its title purports.  The coal     miner's daughter happily relates the events of her life-- early marriage, motherhood, stardom-- leading up     to the present, but instead of dwelling on hardship and tragedy, she sounds satisfied, even joyful.  It's     perhaps a testament to her modesty that she winds up this autobiography in less than three minutes, but     by song's end, her contentment feels undeniably hard-won and admirable: ""I have to say that I've been     blessed/ Not bad for a country girl, I guess.""</p>
<p>Lynn's triumphant return on <i>Van Lear Rose</i> isn't exactly unprecedented: Ten years ago, Johnny Cash     won a younger audience with the Rick Rubin-produced American Recordings, and George Jones, Merle Haggard,     Dolly Parton, and Willie Nelson have all released strong albums late in their careers.  Nor is it surprising     that fans would flock to such sturdy music, that critics would celebrate such a comeback or pursue such a     great story.  But the rating above does not reflect critical sentiment as much as it does critical amazement:     <i>Van Lear Rose</i> is remarkably bold, celebratory and honest.  It's a homecoming for a small-town musician     gifted with poise, humor and compassion, but at its very heart, it's happy to be just a kick-ass country     record.</p></div>"|4961.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4961-van-lear-rose/|9.3|Stephen Deusner

    less challenging than lobbing (more) half-assed jokes about skinny, over-privileged white boys sporting
    vintage t-shirts and pencil-leg Ramones jeans.  As part of a burgeoning metropolitan scene heralded more
    for its influences than its innovations, the French Kicks have long been served their fair share of glib,
    mostly meaningless descriptors, most of which include some comment about their addresses, pants, or haircuts.</p><p>
    
    By way of spiky L.E.S. fashion, or just via simple geography, the Kicks have always seemed to fit rather
    nicely into the Strokes/Interpol/Walkmen scene, despite not sounding a whole lot like any of those bands.
    Consider, then, how the French Kicks' heralded hometown has since become both the band's most efficient
    publicist and most formidable enemy: Fans of NYC new-wave pilfering inevitably flock towards them, but
    quickly figure out that, save their outfits, the French Kicks might as well be from anywhere-- and that,
    unfortunately, their music is just as expressionless.</p><p>
    
    On their 2002 full-length debut, <i>One Time Bells</i>, the French Kicks gave up sloppy garage noodling for
    hyper-stylized post-punk, maintaining just enough of their scrappy beginnings to lend their first long-player
    some youthful punch.  <i>The Trial of the Century</i> is a far more lush, lilting effort than its predecessor,
    ultimately destroyed by the monotony of its sweeping pop swells: Essentially, <i>Trial</i> is just one
    semi-interesting idea (retro-tinged, Smiths-influenced, synth-friendly rock) repeated 11 times-- and no
    matter how able or committed the French Kicks may be to that lone notion, their conviction alone can't make
    their sophomore record feel any less tedious.  Falsetto harmonies, pumping synths, and stay-put vocals
    tumble out in waves, while Nick Stumpf's thunderous drumming and brother Lawrence's sticky bass push
    everything on and on and on.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""One More Time"" is the record's most dynamic track, with bouncy, puttering percussion, gently yawning
    synths, giggly twitters, and fey, sighing vocals, while the almost-interesting ""Oh Fine"" starts off with
    hand-claps, melts into drums, and then kicks up a lowly bassline, Nick Stumpf's vocals gently sliding in
    to purr a gloriously high-pitched, ""We'll be fine/ She'll be fine/ He'll be fine,"" chorus.  Meanwhile,
    ""The Falls"" wouldn't feel too out of place on The Strokes' <i>Room on Fire</i>, although Stumpf's vocals
    never quite reach Casablancan heights of bored disaffection.  The insurmountable problem with the rest of
    the record is that most of the tracks feel entirely indistinguishable, their retro-styling and pompadour
    crooning melting into one giant song (see also some borderline formulaic quirks-- opening with prickly
    bits of percussion, or always building into high, harmonized choruses).</p><p>
    
    The French Kicks shouldn't be forced to swallow the inevitable NYC-backlash alone, but <i>The Trial of the
    Century</i> doesn't help anyone argue that there's something new and compelling about low-idea retro-rock.

    impossible to pin down: a performer and a producer, usually at the same time, Sten has worked on multimedia
    installations and rock concerts, remixes and live improvisation.  He brought his ""audio virus""-- his mystery
    box of electronics and production techniques-- to rock band Motorpsycho in the early 90s, while today he's
    the fourth member of Supersilent, the non-jazzman who adds electronic jolts and subliminal ambience.  He's
    both the band's nervous system, and its agitator.</p><p>
    
    Rune Kristoffersen describes meeting Sten as a crucial event in the founding of his Rune Grammofon imprint,
    and Sten remains one of the label's key players.  But <i>Morals and Dogma</i> is his first solo release for
    them, and it's part of a push that includes a box set, simply titled <i>Deathprod</i>, which collects some
    out-of-print and unreleased material.  (Consumer warning: the set also includes this album.)</p><p>
<i>Morals and Dogma</i>'s ominous, immersive tone may not surprise anyone who's encountered Deathprod before,
    but its purity and rigor are startling.  Working with his audio virus and two guest musicians, Motorpsycho's
    Hans Magnus Ryan and the violinist and saw player Ole Henrik Moe, Sten has created four pieces that are
    gorgeously horrifying.  Even when he makes kitschy or literal decisions-- implying dark rituals, naming a
    song ""Dead People's Things"", choosing a sleeve design that's as black as a coal pit in hell-- nothing
    detracts from the actual music.</p><p>
    
    Reportedly, Sten often builds a piece out of a single source, and on ""Tron"", it seems to be a recording of
    wind-- variable and evolving, but trapped in a membrane to keep it from blowing disruptively free.  The
    sounds of heavy footfalls and the increase in volume at the lowest registers make the track increasingly
    unsettling; if you listen to it with a subwoofer, you may respond the way your pets to do thunder.  The
    few musical tones at the end, which chime like the sounding of a gong, are almost intrusive.</p><p>
    
    When Sten uses an instrument or a found sound, he obscures the source, refusing to take advantage of any
    associations it brings.  Although there are acoustic instruments on the album, he blurs the edges or
    manipulates the attack, keeping control of every detail of the timbre.  For just one example, he uses a
    sound on ""Dead People's Things"" that resembles the suction tool you'd use to clean an aquarium.  You can
    try to pick apart the sound of pebbles gurgling against the plastic, or the drone of streaming water, but
    the outlines blur before you can make out what it really is; and in the end, it may be something as basic
    as a stretched-out violin sample.</p><p>
    
    ""Orgone Donor"", the most musical track, was actually written by Ryan and Moe.  The piece unfurls on long,
    droning tones of rising pitch, and it's a break from the rest of the album: The only track here with a clear,
    simple shape, it's like a beacon of clarity against the amorphous dread around it.  But by the time the
    record closes on ""Cloudchamber"", Sten has pulled you back into the fog.</p><p>
    
    Calling the album ""immersive"" overlooks how much it pushes you away.  The more you sink into the details,
    the more they assemble into something unsettling.  It's hard to believe that Sten could perform this
    material when he plays this year's Sonar Festival in sunny Barcelona: A stern, cold wind will blow through
    whatever space he's playing, and the audience might wonder why the floor continues rumbling after he's left
    the stage.</p></div>"|2554.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2554-morals-and-dogma/|8.3|Chris Dahlen

    a chain bookstore.  For a while, the storewide promotion of non-raucous jazz, skinny cappuccinos, and other
    telltale tropes of now-sound bourgeois hep was funny and even engaging.  But soon enough, the fixation on
    sparkly confetti, martini culture, and Miss Ann-Margret's ""13 Men"" inside a beige superstore grew awfully
    humiliating.  I've avoided easy listening ever since.</p><p>
    
    Imagine my surprise, then, upon discovering Azita's 2003 Drag City release <i>Enantiodromia</i>, on which
    Chicago no-wave icon Azita Youssefi traded the jagged energy of her early work with Scissor Girls and Bride
    of No No for boogie piano and jazzy lounge-- albeit mostly for Steely Dan fans and the punk-at-heart.  A
    year later, she's returned with an even smoother mix.</p><p>
    
    Despite its jarring approximation of the bubbly stuff, <i>Life on the Fly</i> is by no means an unchallenging
    album.  Making use of the same adept back-up band as on <i>Enantiodromia</i>, the core trio consists of herself
    playing piano and singing, boyfriend John McEntire executing nimble rat-a-tat (as well as pristine mint-julep
    engineering) and Isotope 217 bassist Matt Lux contributing a sparse and tasteful low-end.  The guest musicians
    share a similar Chicagoan pedigree: improvisational jazzman Aram Shelton blows alto sax and clarinet, while
    Tortoise's Jeff Parker and Rob Mazurek contribute sometimes over-the-top guitar and cornet intrusions.</p><p>
    
    Like smokey torch singers of old, or Come vocalist Thalia Zedek with a subtle hint of Neko Case twang,
    Youssefi infuses vocal lines with unexpected over-enunciations and dramatic flourishes.  Likewise, her
    dense songwriting offers flippant chord progressions and weird dynamics.  For example, the buoyant opener,
    ""Wasn't in the Bargain"", takes Robert Johnson's crossroads to a barbecue where ol' Lucifer returns to
    collect his debt from a hapless bargainer: ""When the devil comes to take his pay/ You look into his eyes
    and know your sorrow/ Cursing that you never thought you'd see this day/ You didn't have to borrow.""
    Musically, it's Bruce Hornsby jamming to the Sea &amp; Cake and Vince Guaraldi, but despite a couple cheesy
    turns-- including Jeff Parker's disconnected guitar solo and Youssefi's over-emphatic repetition of
    ""Well, I think that I will go""-- it's one of the album's better tracks.</p><p>
    
    It'll take some picking and choosing, but if you give these tickled ivories a chance to seep into your
    pores, there are breezily erudite pop moments.  In the meantime, shuffle past the busy approximation of
    a Dirty Dozen Brass cornet duel on ""Just Joker Blues"", ""Miss Tony""'s remarkable resemblance to a Muzak-y
    Stones' ""Let's Spend the Night Together"", and a few too many vocal grinds bringing on a blush like
    Billy Joel crashing his car while fatuously replaying some lost collaboration of ""Movin' Out"" with Twyla
    Tharp.</p><p>
    
    Whatever the mishaps, Youssefi's making a transition into a new and complex phase of her already admirable
    career, and <i>Life on the Fly</i>'s eccentric dose of ambition and indulgence in a sea of half-assed garage
    rock, out-folk and IDM turns an otherwise middling project into a post-no-wave musical worthy of repeat
    engagements.</p></div>"|397.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/397-life-on-the-fly/|6.4|Brandon Stosuy

Already this
    year there've been a slew of great and different releases in the genre-- it seems Devendra Banhart, Charalambides,
    and Espers will all top year-end lists-- and the juggernaut that is Animal Collective's <i>Sung Tongs</i>
    hasn't even officially hit the streets yet.</p><p>
    
    Among these names we can now count Chicago's Born Heller.  The duo of Josephine Foster and Jason Ajemian
    have put together a chilling debut album of distant backwoods folk, remarkable particularly for its depth
    of sound despite the duo's insistence on sparse, straightforward melodies.  Strummed chords are typically
    passed over in favor of deliberate note-for-note string harmonies and some proper counterpoint.  The ensuing
    nudity of the compositions forces Born Heller, in order to keep the listener occupied, to move from one
    idea to another without much brooding time-- no moment is wasted on mere repetition.  What results is an
    album that's deceptively slow-paced, yet consistently engaging for the entirety of its half-hour runtime.</p><p>
    
    Ajemian is clearly a competent instrumentalist, as his work with Rob Mazurek and Ken Vandermark attests.
    But Foster, a veritable American Shirley Collins, is the star here.  From her first croons on ""I Want To"",
    Foster manages what some might liken to a clandestine amateur opera: Her voice is quiet, shaky even, but
    she manages a practiced control over her pitch and delivery.  Which is important: Foster often taps into a
    certain melodrama that finds a face only in the most assuredly private bathroom mirrors.  The glam works
    here perhaps to its own chagrin because it sounds quite real and vulnerable; if someone told Foster she
    sounds like an idiot, I get the feeling she might tailspin into depression.</p><p>
    
    As on ""I Want To"", Born Heller's compelling brittleness can be attributed to its circumspect broken-glass-on-floor
    approach to tandem guitar/vocal rubato.  ""Mountain Song"" provides one of the album's best moments, pitting
    double-plucked strings against Foster's calmly delivered, yet gritty brown narrative: ""We're lost in the
    mountains... Call a paramedic.""  The song's most brilliant stroke, however, is Born Heller's suspended
    violin tones, which, by moving in and out of key, lend gravity to an otherwise vaudevillian display.  ""Lulu
    Fellows"", an outwardly darker counterpart to ""Mountain Song"", succeeds for similar reasons, though perhaps
    glosses over the low-level tension which worked so well earlier.</p><p>
    
    Ajemian accompanies a moaning Foster in the highly charged duet ""First Kiss"", and, whether wittingly or
    not, recalls Thom Yorke when in mid-high register.  The other duet, ""Big Sky #4"", comes off similarly
    over-the-top, but in turn, Born Heller seem to acknowledge their own indulgent stage drama on melodically
    upbeat no-frills ditties like ""The Left Garden"" (""In the left garden, this dead bird is all I found""), and
    the two sparse harp-driven numbers, ""I Am a Guest in Here"" and ""Pansies, Will You Ever Grow?"".</p><p>
    
    If one could characterize the rest of the debut as creepy, then ""Good Times"" is Born Heller's most
    terrifyingly beautiful nightmare, without question the album's standout track.  While for the most part
    a distant co-presence, Foster's voice occasionally cannot help but nod to the chaos behind it: In this
    riveting soundstorm, strings screech in menacing atonal unison, and Foster's own mandolin manages some
    remarkable intermittent melodies.  In just over two minutes, ""Good Times"" summarizes the degree of sound
    texture and honest melody Born Heller can squeeze not only out of such sparse instrumentation, but such
    deliberately honest composition as well.  The paradox makes the duo's debut a particularly interesting
    grower-album, as the duo's most initially accessible melodies become increasingly problematic with increased
    rotation, and compellingly so.</p></div>"|1109.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1109-born-heller/|7.8|Nick Sylvester

Life goes on here irrespective of the outside world.  It's all one big long
    Bohemian vacation, where bushy beards and handrolled cigarettes are protocol.  The laws are different here
    than elsewhere; take, for instance, the painted crosswalks, designated points in the street at which one
    may cross at any time, regardless of traffic lights, at the bequest of penal-code-abiding motorists.
    Billboards are rare.  Outside of Boston, there are no news tickers to update locals on the truly fucked-up
    shit an average hour brings.  And if there were, no one would pay attention anyway.</p><p>
    
    At least that's how I see things when I visit.  Sunburned Hand of the Man <i>might</i> have a TV, or
    occasionally peruse <i>The Berkshire Eagle</i>, but my money says they don't.  The Massachusetts free-folk
    collective is too busy making bizarre, limited-press albums and engaging a formidable cult following to do
    otherwise.  Oddly enough, in eight years as a band, Sunburned Hand have never before released a CD,
    eschewing accessibility both physically and intellectually.</p><p>
<i>Rare Wood</i> is the group's first foray into formal studio recording, which is both good and bad news
    for fans of the group.  Gone are the handpacked hemp protective sleeves, replaced by the infinitely more
    mundane digipak, in exchange for the much wider availability a studio issue offers.  Sadly, that availability
    isn't fully capitalized upon, as <i>Rare Wood</i> will likely only appeal to the band's ardent stable of
    fans.  Newcomers would be far better off seeking out one of the group's mysterious CD-R or vinyl-only
    releases through rare-records vendors such as Ecstatic Yod.</p><p>
    
    To be frank, <i>Rare Wood</i> simply pales in comparison to many of the group's previous releases,
    especially <i>Headdress</i> or <i>Wild Animal</i>.  Where those records were harsh, but also tuneful and
    emotive, <i>Rare Wood</i> is, well, mainly harsh.  Bestial vocals play a more prominent role on this album
    than elsewhere in the group's discography, and as a result, the expansive milieu of guitar, bass, found
    sound, and oddball percussion that has come to epitomize the band's sound is muzzled in favor of a more
    confrontational approach.  Though the record might seem to fall in fairly close proximity to Sunburned
    Hand's other work, and marks no significant departure from their organic free-folk logotype, it fails to
    live up to better work from the group's LP series.</p><p>
    
    ""Shitless"", alone, from <i>Headdress</i>, packs more melody than <i>Rare Wood</i>'s entirety.  Unless you've
    got an ear for particularly strident music, vocals that sound like nothing so much as Andre the Giant spooning
    molasses probably won't sit too well in your stomach.  Some might argue that that's the point, but on prior
    outings, the band managed to sound as immersive as they were acerbic.  That elemental blend of bitter and
    sweet is what has made the group's best work so enjoyable.  Here, it's hard to ignore the caustic
    stream-of-conciousness vocals and just appreciate the seductive, primeval freakout happening in the
    background.</p><p>
<i>Rare Wood</i> does pack a scant handful of instrumental passages in its curt 42-minute runtime that
    recall the strength of the group's earlier work.  As the paranoid opener ""Easy Wind"" fades into ""Gyp
    Hawkin'"", along with it go the glottal squeals, and the subsequent ten minutes are pleasantly reminiscent
    of the band's better moments.  ""Gyp Hawkin'"" expands upon the amorphous instrumental rambling of the band's
    earlier material by featuring sparse organ swells and haphazard bursts of synthesizer.  Texturally, it's by
    far this album's most affable moment, due in no small part to its lack of vocals.  Unfortunately, the
    similar, centerpiece-length ""Glass Boot"" fails to diverge from <i>Rare Wood</i>'s central instrumental
    motifs, and is overpowered by more jarring vocal jabs.  ""Buried Pleasure"", the album's abrupt closer, feels
    like a beginning to a new piece, rather than a summation of one to which it has no discernable stylistic
    connection.</p><p>
    
    When a band releases 14 albums in three years, as Sunburned Hand of the Man have since 2001, it's
    unrealistic to expect them to be on the money every time.  <i>Rare Wood</i> wouldn't be such a
    disappointment if it were just another one of the myriad homespun release in the tumescent Sunburned
    Hand catalog, instead of the band's first album proper.  As it stands, the album is a landmark document
    for a group whose career has been shrouded by isolation and mystery.  Beyond that, however, its interest
    is marginal.</p></div>"|7570.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7570-rare-wood/|6.4|Sam Ubl

At first blush it seems illogical-- the place is covered with ice and snow, after
    all-- but huge swaths of the continent receive less precipitation in a year than the Mojave.  In my mind,
    this is an interesting factoid in and of itself, but in terms of this review it would be useless if it
    didn't relate directly to the direction Friends of Dean Martinez have taken lately.   And it does.</p><p>
    
    The Friends built their name on capturing the open air and empty expanse of the American Southwest in their
    high, lonesome sound.  Every drumbeat was a fence post eroded by wind-blown dust, the organs were the
    lengths of barbed wire and the illusion of water on the horizon, while Bill Elm's steel guitar was the
    open sky, blistering in the sun and frigid at night.  As members came and went, the band shifted further
    from the sun-fried day and deeper into the mysterious desert night, crafting a sound over two recent albums--
    <i>A Place in the Sun</i> and <i>On the Shore</i>-- that seethed with escaping heat and nocturnal energy.
    Now, with <i>Random Harvest</i>, they call to mind a place of utter desolation, a place that feels more
    like the desert on the bottom of the world than the desert outside Tucson.</p><p>
    
    Mind you, there's still a heaping helping of the Old West here, but when the band reaches for the cold on
    songs like ""The Winter Palace"" and ""Why Does My Heart Go on Beating?"" they wind up in a deep freeze.  ""Why
    Does My Heart Go on Beating?"" sounds as though it were mastered from vinyl, with its crackling surface noise,
    and the creeping mass of echoing pings and skin-tighteningly cold drones.  ""The Winter Palace"" is more
    structured, resting on an ice sheet of humming Moog bass and smeared organ and synth while nylon-stringed
    guitar wanders through the landscape trying to find its way.</p><p>
    
    Elsewhere, the guys find themselves in more familiar territory, opening the title track with a plaintive
    string theme that the drums only sweep aside as they usher in Elm's steel and Mike Semple's arid electric
    guitar.  If Elm and Semple's guitars dance with each other in complex melodic interplay on ""Random Harvest"",
    then they spar openly on ""Ripcord"", Semple's tone dripping with acid and Elm's steel sporting ragged distortion.
    ""Dusk"" plays like the approach-- and finally, the arrival-- of a torrential desert storm, building on the
    horizon with thunderheads and lightning, and finally gushing buckets as the band reaches a climax.</p><p>
    
    And that's not even the best stuff.  They save that for the end, with the skywalking waltz ""Lost Horizon"",
    resplendent with majestic slide work and a gorgeous acoustic guitar solo, and the astral lament ""Nowhere
    to Go"".  On that final track, Elm's steel searches the heavens, grounded by glockenspiel and acoustic
    guitar flourishes, but the song comes crashing to earth for Semple's ferocious multi-tracked guitar solo.
    Semple's playing suggests that the random harvest of the album title might one of souls by angry gods
    rather than a reaping of grain by humans with threshers.</p><p>
    
    And with that, Friends of Dean Martinez have done it again, crafting an album of absorbing texture and
    rending grace.  <i>Random Harvest</i> isn't quite as stunning as <i>A Place in the Sun</i> or <i>On the
    Shore</i>, but it's close, and besides, equaling the majesty of either of those records is a tall order.
    Either way, it's a fine testament to the fact that our driest, emptiest expanses can also be some of the
    most beautiful.</p></div>"|3205.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3205-random-harvest/|7.8|Joe Tangari

Most end up progressing towards
    more positive, ""enlightened"" styles (De La Soul, Jurassic 5) while others fall for the promise of financial
    success allowed by the party rap platform (Black Eyed Peas).  But in the case of Foreign Legion, the
    listener isn't inclined to care either way.  From the outset of their second record, <i>Playtight</i>,
    we're immediately made aware that this ""fun rap"" isn't actually rap-intensive, or even fun, for that
    matter.</p><p>
    
    Prozack, DJ Design and Marc Stretch encompass Foreign Legion, a group best known for their explosive live
    show (I've heard tales of Prozack rapping out of Stretch's backpack) and a lackadaisical musical style.
    To be fair, they do pull off the party vibe pretty well, translating on record like a bunch of drunk fat
    guys leading the soiree from the balcony.  Unfortunately, they also rap just like him.  Over the course
    of the album, you'll hear embarrassing falsetto choruses, various ""style changes"" (poor homages to their
    commercial influences) and most frequently, incredibly offbeat rapping.</p><p>
    
    What's surprising is the locale from which Foreign Legion hails.  Considering that California has been a
    breeding ground for the most amusing, innovative and exciting fun rappers of our generation (Hieroglyphics,
    Freestyle Fellowship, The Pharcyde, Quannum), you'd expect them to have some semblance of charisma.  They
    can incorporate the whitest faux-soul imaginable, put on silly voices and recite amateurish verses (""My crew
    comes tighter than masturbating with vice grips!""; ""You could be a butler but ain't no way that you're
    serving me!""; ""The whole club looks like a bunch of Pez dispensers!""), but they also lack flow, delivery,
    and any sense of likability.</p><p>
    
    Half the problem with the record is the ridiculously bad production.  Other than problems like lyrical
    nonsense and lame rappers, the reason groups that have a similar aesthetic (Cunninlyguists, Ugly Duckling)
    end up with better results is ultimately down to the beats that frame the music.  From the Tom Jones-inspired
    ""It's Working"" (cut atop soap opera piano stabs and a corny synth bounce), to the lazy electro throb of
    ""Happy Drunk"", to the wanky wah-wah pedal and clavinet of ""Voodoo Star"", the results are wholly unlistenable
    .  DJ Design lists his equipment in the liner notes before the lyrics to each song, but in this case, it
    looks like his laundry list of gear is worth a lot more than he is.</p><p>
    
    So what did I like about the album?  The beats for ""Bring It"" and ""Party Crashers"" are tolerable.  And Marc
    Stretch rhymes a lot of words in his bars.  Oh yeah, and when Prozack said that he ""rocks an O.J. Simpson
    jersey,"" I giggled.  I guess that's about it.  All I have left to ask is: What exactly would possess someone
    to pay money for this?  Which is where you come in: If you or someone you know owns this album, I ask you
    to email me with the exact reason this record came into possession.  If this is supposed to be a representation
    of the future of underground rap, sign me up for my old school revivalism.</p></div>"|3294.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3294-playtight/|2.1|Rollie Pemberton

    speakers when reviewing records.  This person, who is playing the tunes and singing the songs, isn't to
    be treated as a performer so much as the instigator of all the terrible/wonderful noise infesting the
    writer's world, and should be judged accordingly.  That is, by the social rules of rock criticism, one
    shouldn't judge the musicians at all, merely their music-- and even then, only in terms of how it affects
    the writer, and in turn, how it might do the same for other listeners.  The ""argument"" comes during the
    moments when you either agree or disagree with the writer's experience.</p><p>
    
    The next thing writers learn is that just thinking of one's own experience isn't enough, because there's
    a whole world out there giving clues to the real value of the music.  If music ""matters,"" it follows that
    its impact should be obvious outside the window; ""relevance"" is paramount at this stage of criticism,
    though since bitter humility is a daily part of any rock writer's life, it pays to phrase arguments
    stressing relevance in ways that don't obviously indicate its bias.  This kind of criticism may seem harsh
    (and pretty unrelated to the actual musical experience), but it also shares much with traditional journalistic
    aims of reporting and immediate interpretation, and as such, is a method emphasized at most mainstream music
    pubs.</p><p>
    
    All of this brings me to Prince and his latest album, <i>Musicology</i>.  What happens when, by the two
    most common forms of writing about music, a legend comes out looking like a drastic underachiever?  Do I
    dare call him out on this, especially after seeing many educated people pledge their written testimonies
    to this stuff?  I've lived with this record for a few weeks now, and by any normal measure, I fail to see
    how anyone could seriously call it a comeback, or a return to his intimidating good form.  But that's
    presumptuous: Despite the tried-and-true edicts of rock crit, there really is no accounting for taste,
    nor is Prince's extended absence from the top of the pops a concrete sign that he no longer matters.</p><p>
    
    Yet, I know what I hear: an artist who is beyond condescending his interests to generate relevance.  I hear
    someone who's honestly more concerned with the pristine state of his record collection than he is in buying
    all the latest hits.  I hear someone who's probably worked out most of the bigger issues in life, and is
    satisfied to stay with a groove for its own sake, offering his take on things rather than arresting you
    with it.  Prince has never been embarrassed of himself on record, but on <i>Musicology</i>, his direction
    only makes sense to me in the broadest sense of appreciating life and love.  The revolution is over in this
    corner, and I'd bet it all he could care less what anyone thinks about it.  Unfortunately, in this case, it
    translates to music that, while often pleasant, lacks the power of not only his best work, but also most of
    his successors' stuff.  And since Prince's ""successors"" could be considered half of everything on the radio,
    it's tough for me to give him the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>
    
    The most interesting moments on <i>Musicology</i> come when Prince either hits on a good concept (like the
    rich white girl who can't dance paying out for the ""funk"" in ""Illusion, Coma, Pimp and Circumstance"") or
    drops the pretense of keeping the party going altogether.  Today, slow jams are his forte: the infidelity
    warning ""What Do U Want Me 2 Do?"" beats Phoenix at their own game with smoother-than-smooth vocals and a
    breezy chorus that would seem to close the book on anyone else attempting lite-jazz pop in the future.
    ""Call My Name"" is hardly as distinct, but is a perfectly functional slab of loverman soul along the lines
    of Marvin Gaye.  Typically, Prince saves his best moves for the chorus (he's still pop, through and through),
    as his layered harmonies impart the rather straightforward admission, ""I know it's only been three hours,
    but I love it when you call my name.""</p><p>
    
    Those songs seem a tier above others on <i>Musicology</i> partially because Prince isn't doing his one-man
    band thing.  Despite that I've always thought it was cool to hear him make records mostly by himself, some
    of the songs here betray either a disinterest in fleshing out arrangements or an inability to pull them off.
    ""A Million Days"" has the structure of good Prince rock ballad, but the sound of half-finished demo.  The
    synth that powers the opening sounds piped in from a home studio built about 20 years ago, and even then
    it's not loud enough.  His guitar and vocals are lavishly spread all over the mix, but the drums are too
    soft and muddy, so ultimately his track comes out like a bad Lenny Kravitz throwaway.  Elsewhere, ""Life
    O' the Party"" and the title track suggest nothing in Prince's life these days was born this century.  Not
    only does he waste valuable time on the former making fun of Michael Jackson, but the track is mired in
    stale funk a notch below the <i>Martin</i> theme.</p><p>
    
    ""Cinnamon Girl"" is the best straight rock track on <i>Musicology</i>, not only because its production is on
    par with Prince's typically well-crafted hooks, but also because it manages to keep all the details in check
    via relatively simple performance.  Prince's grasp is hardly lacking throughout, but for various reasons,
    his reach comes up short many times.  ""If Eye Was the Man in Ur Life"" starts out as an incredible jam with
    metal guitar, a tight, slow beat (not played by Prince) and a glorious harmonized verse melody, before
    bogging down at the end with some kind of be-bop thing right out of a Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears song.  I'm all
    for experimentation, but this seems more like a bad case of mid-song boredom and a lack of anything better
    to do.</p><p>
    
    The worst part is that <i>Musicology</i> is probably the best Prince album since at least the ""symbol"" album
    from 1992, and possibly since <i>Sign O' the Times</i>.  But that's misleading, since this album isn't close
    to <i>Sign</i>'s league-- it's also depressing to think he hasn't made a great record in over 15 years.  But
    don't take my word for it; look out the window, see if any of your friends are jamming to this.  Failing that,
    chart your own experience in your own headphones.  By either measure, despite a few good moments, I'm missing
    Prince now more than ever.</p></div>"|6479.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6479-musicology/|5.8|Dominique Leone

    on the first three pages of a Google search for his name.  It's easy to see why.  For one, the encumbering
    folklore that drags heavy about Wolf's skinny shoulders is intriguing in all the right ways: He casts himself
    as a neo-Dickensian laptop minstrel, a wandering electro-folk organ grinder, and a pacifist werewolf bent
    on a nomadic musical existence.  Whether or not you buy into his mythology, though, his debut album confirms
    better reasons to check his music, not least of which is that the stockpile of personal issues he doles out
    here contains enough agony and energy to fuel the fires of several puberties.</p><p>
    
    When Fat Cat Records discovered him four years ago, and saw fit to kit him out with his own mini-studio,
    he was just 16, but had already chalked up ten years of musicianship.  He toured Europe with an orchestra,
    before going on to form the now-defunct punk band Maison Crimineaux in Paris.  (The alias ""Patrick Wolf"" was
    conceived there shortly thereafter, with the assistance of a local clairvoyant.)  And this impressive
    background has paid off with <i>Lycanthropy</i>, on which he wraps his folk-pop musings in lush blankets
    of violin, viola, harp and harpsichord, and tricks out the mix with aggressive electronic textures.  His
    singing voice is fantastic as well, with a broad British accent recalling the caustic androgyny of Suede's
    Brett Anderson.</p><p>
    
    Late British author Angela Carter played a formative role in Wolf's thematic development; her novel, <i>The
    Brotherhood of the Wolf</i>, inspired his lycanthropy obsession.  Carter based much of her work on themes of
    adolescence embodied in erotic folklore metaphor, and here, Wolf occasionally paraphrases or condenses some
    of her passages in lyrics like, ""I was once a boy/ Until I cut my penis off/ And grew a hairy scar of stubborn
    fire.""  But if his transformation from boy to wolf is complete, he's still marked by a mortal vulnerability--
    a result of an unsettled childhood of bullying and rejection.</p><p>
    
    ""A Boy Like Me"" is a perfectly sculpted pop song for the ubiquitous dissolute youth: ""A boy like me is told
    he is both nine and ninety/ And a boy like me should shut those books and join the army.""  Alienation and
    teen misery are not rare commodities in music, but Wolf throws up such provocative contrasts (""I want total
    chaos/ And a holiday home in the east"") that his naivete often seems acknowledged-- possibly even a put-on--
    just another undercurrent in the clever, serpentine narratives that guide us through this densely self-aware
    work.</p><p>
    
    When Wolf brings his considerable sequencing skills to the forefront, <i>Lycanthropy</i> echoes Warp Records
    prodigy Chris Clark's raw and uncompromising 2000 release <i>Clarence Park</i>.  But then, Wolf's influences
    are so numerous that if occasional snatches of Clark or Nick Cave or Joni Mitchell are briefly detected,
    they quickly give way to fusions of other artists, or combine to create a sound of their own.  Meanwhile,
    the music itself is polarized and raw, with (naturally) lycanthropic juxtapositions of rustic/urban,
    ordered/chaotic, naive/cynical.</p><p>
    
    It may be tempting for some to judge Wolf in terms of his age, but this would be doing a disservice to a
    lyricist of such courage.  If any complaint could be lodged against <i>Lycanthropy</i>, it's that it
    sometimes lacks subtlety, as it's possessed by a heady, pubescent intoxication that can result in some
    indiscriminate vocalizing.  Still, witnessing such breathless unraveling of the heart and such thoughtless
    conviction that never quite sounds arrogant is exhilarating-- not to mention rare.  Indeed, with <i>Lycanthropy</i>,
    Wolf has constructed a themed record that deftly manipulates myths while brazenly striding into new,
    tumultuous territory.  On the eve of his virgin U.S. tour this May, it would seem he has more in common
    with the Pied Piper than with Peter Pan, and his eerie playing will surely seduce many into his following.</p></div>"|8773.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8773-lycanthropy/|8.2|Dan Lett

When you spend months at a time
    without leaving the city and suburbs you get so used to pavement and manicured lots that it starts to
    look normal, as though there never was any prairie or forest there to begin with.  While the sprawl I'm
    used to is Chicago, Patrick Gubler is similarly incubated from the natural world in New York City, but
    he's somehow managed to keep in touch with the backwoods and dirt roads that make up the parts of America
    in which most of us have never resided.  Since exiting Tower Recordings to cut albums on his own as P.G.
    Six, he's crafted a deeply naturalistic sound rooted in the early 70s progressive folk of the British
    Isles, with room for diversions into abstract expressionist interludes.</p><p>
<i>The Well of Memory</i> is Gubler's second album as P.G. Six, and it treads similar ground to his debut,
    opening with a creepy/pretty harp improvisation and dialing up Pentagle, Steeleye Span and Magna Carta from
    there with a clutch of songs and instrumentals that wouldn't sound out of place in the score for a new
    cinematic adaptation of <i>MacBeth</i>.  Gubler plays a mean Renaissance Faire guitar, and his even, earthy
    croon helps keep the fog from blowing too far off the moors.</p><p>
    
    The opening title track is a lengthy harp improvisation that sounds played on an open-tuned instrument,
    which Gubler plucks and strums, the lower strings ringing with a guttural quality that clouds the sound
    with overtones.  He revisits this approach twice more on the album, which is unfortunately twice too much,
    as it's easy to lose interest during these meandering passages.  He slips free-folk elements like these
    into a lot of the more conventional songs to better effect, winding down ""Come In/The Winter It Is Past""
    with a prolonged passage of droning buzz, while his hovering electric guitar lights fire to ""Crooked Way""'s
    entrancing acoustic folk.</p><p>
    
    The most traditional song Gubler offers is ""The Old Man on the Mountain"", a narrative ballad so simply
    worded and old-school that I'm surprised Smithsonian Folkways hasn't picked up the publishing rights.  Over
    his fluttering acoustic, he falls asleep by the roadside and dreams of walking up the mountain finding an
    old man living among the remnants of a past settlement.  Closer ""The Weeping Willow"", with backing vocals
    from Helen Rush, sounds almost ancient with its spare acoustic guitar and piano arrangement, while ""Considering
    the Lateness of the Hour"" is a hill gnome freakout with guitars melting and running like slag over plunking
    hand drums and shaker.</p><p>
    
    Unfortunately, the album's scattered peaks aren't enough to overcome a general sense of aimless drift that
    hangs over the album as a whole-- the songs have a tendency to slip by unnoticed if you start doing even
    the most minor thing while listening.  Fans of P.G. Six's debut, <i>Parlor Tricks &amp; Porch Favorites</i>,
    should be pleased with this effort, as the two albums are extremely similar, but this is primarily recommended
    for only the most intrepid fans of the recent free-folk explosion.</p></div>"|7755.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7755-the-well-of-memory/|6.6|Joe Tangari

    pulse of intertwining melodies to lend momentum to music.  Their melodic lines would twist along, gathering
    dissonances that would eventually explode against their rhythms into warm, open intervals.  But back in
    those days, they didn't have drum machines to pull their lines into orbit.  Ratatat does, and it gives
    their music an epic quality that would send any monk into fits of orgiastic glee.</p><p>
    
    Ratatat is a collaboration between lead guitarist Mike Stroud and bedroom producer Evan Mast, with piercing
    sheets of guitar and synthesizer yoked to a bass-heavy metronomic grid.  The project marks a new direction
    for both musicians: Evan Mast's 2001 debut as E*vax, <i>Parking Lot Music</i>, was a stroll through a
    collection of debris both sleek and gritty, while Mike was known for ripping it up on stage with Ben Kweller
    and Dashboard Confessional.  With Ratatat, however, the pair establishes a plush, crisp sonic space, and
    then holds court there for a good three quarters of an hour.</p><p>
    
    Theirs is an imperial presence, somewhere near the crossroads of rock, electronic and hip-hop.  Though their
    songs are pop-length, and each is bound to get stuck in your head, these are not actually songs in the
    conventional sense.  There are no vocals, for one thing, and they grow from point A to point B without
    looking back over their shoulder for a chorus.  While the album is a home studio creation, most of the
    material begs to strut on stage for a hungry crowd.  Indeed, what we have here is a long-awaited stepchild
    of IDM and hair metal sensibilities, joined by the omnivorous appetite of hip-hop.</p><p>
    
    And Ratatat <i>is</i> hip-hop.  For starters, ""Lapland"" and ""Breaking Away"" feature the sort of spacious,
    head-nodding beats that fuel freestyle fantasies, and recently led the duo to a mixtape collaboration with
    Wu-Tang's Buddha Monk.  The two waifish Crown Heights boys also sprinkle their album with samples of local
    rap veteran Young Churf, who starts out the album with a sly boast: ""I've been rapping for about 17 years,
    okay?  I don't write my stuff anymore. I just take it from my head...""</p><p>
    
    So it begins.  The opener, ""17 Years"", is heavy artillery singed with the roar and crackle of distorted
    power chords.  But it has a change of heart halfway through, wandering from the guitar-rock battlefield
    to graze on bittersweet, twilit pastures.  ""El Pico"" cultivates a brighter kind of melancholy.  Layered with scraping
    percussion, sweet electric piano figures, wiry synthesizers, and even an old accordion, it sets a tone that
    somehow manages to be intimate and epic at the same time.</p><p>
    
    Ratatat is also good old-fashioned rock. ""Desert Eagle"" has a sing-songy quality that explains why so many
    people have been trying to put words to these tunes since Mast and Stroud started performing together as
    Cherry last year.  But if ""Desert Eagle"" promises an indie rock ballad, it soon turns into a towering
    arena-rock anthem that delivers a healthy dose of Brian May.  There is, after all, more than a little Queen
    in Ratatat's sound, which, when paired with Evan's husky, meticulous beats, results in a surprisingly
    buoyant thrash that delivers on the promise of early rock/rap crossovers.</p><p>
    
    The duo's debut tends towards harmonic saturation, folding over you with great swaths of guitar and synthesizer.
    Unsurprisingly, the effect is intensely pleasurable, giving the album a warm and almost amniotic sense of
    immediacy.  But a womb can also be a prison.  Despite the risk of claustrophobia, Ratatat keep the oxygen
    flowing with well-proportioned chord cycles backed by spare, expansive beats.  In soaring like a motet
    yet pounding like cavalry-- or, in modern terms, in ripping like Jimi but bumping like Dre-- Ratatat
    deliver on the ancient promise that harmony and rhythm, often set against each other in the history of
    Western music, are really just facets of one another.</p></div>"|6913.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6913-ratatat/|8.4|Loren Ludwig & Jascha Hoffman

With their new imprint, Sublime Frequencies, dedicated to documenting     music accumulated on decades' worth of wandering travel to distant spots on the globe, they have realized     their greatest ambition yet: creating a body of music and sound that will have lasting archival import,     resonating especially in the all-too-sheltered American world.  That these releases also feature some of     the most challenging, mysterious, ludicrous, brilliant music ever documented (even in comparison to the     band's own oeuvre) is merely the cherry on top.</p>

However, unlike world music labels of the past-- Folkways, Ocora,     Lyrichord, Nonesuch Explorer, etc.-- Sublime Frequencies never reveals its hand, and no explanatory notes or     anthropological clap-trap are offered.  There are no maps or handles to grasp, and listener and writer alike     have no choice but to be overwhelmed beyond comprehension and completely lost in these aural landscapes of     field recordings, tape collages, interviews, and bazaar-bought cassette compilations.

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Passing Through Syria</span><br/> Airwaves and interviews.  We move through the streets.  A steel door is pulled down in front of a closing     storefront.  Voices bounce from beneath the stone archway.  The streets are dusty; the air is dry.  A     transistor radio sits in an open window, blaring sleigh bells, strings, anguished voices.  What do you     know?  Belly dancers at the falafel place.  Syrian rock?  Puny digital drums clank along with the SynSonic     technology, handclaps any stateside robot would call laughably fake.  And then the voice: A high desert Tom     Jones, bellowing what has to be a song of lust.</p>
<p>The distortions of imperfect technology add layers to the sounds I pick up in the avenues.  If you place     aluminum foil on an antenna, the sounds are cleaner.  If you half-smash a boom box, it emits something     closer to the truth: The bleed between tracks and people.  I start a conversation: ""There are changes in     Syria, of course.  It is the way it must be.  We have our culture.  I lived five years in Holland: racist.     We are the civilized world.  White man = racist.  America's only 200 years old.  I laugh at it.  America's     the country where I don't want to live.""  Then some French.  I'm hungry.  Another conversation, a homosexual     man mentions ""Say You'll Be There"".  Certain passages like spider webs:</p>
<p>""Problem because of Islam. Sometimes I am afraid. Little. Meet in the cinema. No bars. In one/four million     maybe 1,000 homosexuals. Very bad. 75. 15 normal. Puberty. Normal if boy or girl. Sperm. Here problem.""</p>
<p>Wife knows you're a homosexual?</p>
<p>""No, no-- secret. Woman jealous. Big, strong woman here. Problem. Problem. Big jealous. Divorce, goodbye.""</p>
<p>February 21, 1997: It ends with the groan of a camel. The silence between the notes is an anchor dropped     all around the world. Is this Syria the one you see on the map? This is one man's Syria, I suppose, and     like they used to say about radio, the pictures here are better.</p>

A steel door is pulled down in front of a closing     storefront.  Voices bounce from beneath the stone archway.  The streets are dusty; the air is dry.  A     transistor radio sits in an open window, blaring sleigh bells, strings, anguished voices.  What do you     know?  Belly dancers at the falafel place.  Syrian rock?

It is the way it must be.  We have our culture.  I lived five years in Holland: racist.     We are the civilized world.  White man = racist.  America's only 200 years old.  I laugh at it.  America's     the country where I don't want to live.""  Then some French.  I'm hungry.  Another conversation, a homosexual     man mentions ""Say You'll Be There"".  Certain passages like spider webs:</p>
<p>""Problem because of Islam. Sometimes I am afraid. Little. Meet in the cinema. No bars. In one/four million     maybe 1,000 homosexuals. Very bad. 75. 15 normal. Puberty. Normal if boy or girl. Sperm. Here problem.""</p>
<p>Wife knows you're a homosexual?</p>
<p>""No, no-- secret. Woman jealous. Big, strong woman here. Problem. Problem. Big jealous. Divorce, goodbye.""</p>
<p>February 21, 1997: It ends with the groan of a camel. The silence between the notes is an anchor dropped     all around the world. Is this Syria the one you see on the map? This is one man's Syria, I suppose, and     like they used to say about radio, the pictures here are better.</p>

<p>August 21, 1992: So what do we have, three dozen different stringed instruments? One hundred different kinds     of drums? Or is it a single drum design with endless variations?

Even     as I wake, I can remember the terrible sound of his chewing, amplified as it is by the karaoke mic.</p>
<p>A man dressed like a demon insinuates himself into a group of masked dancers. He reminds me of a witch     doctor. He spins erotically. I've started smoking.

America's     the country where I don't want to live.""  Then some French.  I'm hungry.  Another conversation, a homosexual     man mentions ""Say You'll Be There"".  Certain passages like spider webs:</p>
<p>""Problem because of Islam. Sometimes I am afraid. Little. Meet in the cinema. No bars. In one/four million     maybe 1,000 homosexuals. Very bad. 75. 15 normal. Puberty. Normal if boy or girl. Sperm. Here problem.""</p>
<p>Wife knows you're a homosexual?</p>
<p>""No, no-- secret. Woman jealous. Big, strong woman here. Problem. Problem. Big jealous. Divorce, goodbye.""</p>
<p>February 21, 1997: It ends with the groan of a camel. The silence between the notes is an anchor dropped     all around the world. Is this Syria the one you see on the map? This is one man's Syria, I suppose, and     like they used to say about radio, the pictures here are better.</p>

I forget to ask his name before my eyes wander to a     produce stand with green bananas. Tiny red sticker announcing a familiar brand. I try to pick out a bassline     or individual notes from a horn and realize they're actually creating a dust storm-- everything a palimpsest     of rubble and dry, dry dirt.</p>
<p>August 21, 1992: So what do we have, three dozen different stringed instruments? One hundred different kinds     of drums? Or is it a single drum design with endless variations? No two songs share the same percussion     sound. Some drums are cardboard; others, titanium. Enough variety to fill the Library of Congress with     sample CD-ROMs.</p>
<p>Hash Dream #14: Turbaned and robed bots are chasing after my Alfa Romeo Spider as I weave through tiny     streets paved with cassingles. My sunglasses are but petroleum smeared across my face. I try to take them     off by plucking my eyelashes with tweezers. The steering wheel becomes slick, and I crash into an ox. Even     as I wake, I can remember the terrible sound of his chewing, amplified as it is by the karaoke mic.</p>
<p>A man dressed like a demon insinuates himself into a group of masked dancers. He reminds me of a witch     doctor. He spins erotically. I've started smoking.

Later, trying to refocus,     nothing looks like I'd imagined.

Of course now I     idealize condescendingly.</p>
<p>Hash Dream #6: James Brown is in an eggplant tux, sweat cascading off him as he tells Bobby Byrd that he     wants to ""get into it, you know, like a Sikh machine"". But as Byrd puts his parched lips to the shenai,     Brown zaps him into a teeny mosquito. Brown allows the mosquito to buzz and suckle at his neck while he     grunts and the band plays through their new mandibles.</p>
<p>April 1, 1988: Here's an orchestra of spoons on mosaic tile. Some of the musicians wear green vests, which     remind me of St. Patrick's Day. One time I couldn't get into DoJo's because an early morning reveler was     passed-out in front of the door. His friend kept repeating, ""I told him it wasn't worth it."" Here, two men     in matching white shirts and blue jeans dance along joyfully. My favorite, the more animate, is wearing a     nametag and has something draped over his shoulders.</p>
<p>A parallel-universe Tammy Wynette stands by her man as he awaits execution. Explosions of unidentifiable     wooden percussion-- why divide time into equal segments? Rainforest opera transformed beyond recognition     by the power of the modulated frequency. Small anti-room, a man in a dashiki pecks at a piano that emits     notes submerged in water and vinegar. A brocade blanket's been placed over the proceedings. Gold and red.     Sounds like chopsticks with the door closed. Outside, the streets are filled with cheers.

A few years ago,
    Coates awoke from a dream certain he had been 1930s jazz dandy Al Bowlly and 60s cult actress Tuesday Weld
    in the nocturnal presence; that day he adopted a new name, sidetracked a career in the visual arts, and
    began to make modern music that drew inspiration from classic European cabaret and throwback romanticism.
    With <i>I, Lucifer</i>, Coates, under nom-de-chanson (The Real) Tuesday Weld, draws the listener deep into
    a scratchy, sepia-toned fantasy that first suggests the gap between boozy, swinging ragtime, sophisticated
    lounge poetics, and innovative beat technique, then bridges it in one swooning swoop.</p><p>
    
    Besides its musical dexterity and pastiche of divergent styles, <i>I, Lucifer</i> is interesting for the
    fact that it's the soundtrack to English author Glenn Duncan's novel of the same name.  The story is the
    devil's first-person account of his attempt at redemption by spending a month in the all-too-human body of
    down-and-out author Declan Gunn (hello, anagram?) without committing grievous sin.  Though clearly the CD
    and the book don't match up song by page, they both evoke the same wry British humor and sense of inevitable,
    tragic love, making for a unique intellectual experience that gets through to the heart via the head.  It's
    a pretty grandiose prospect that surprisingly never settles into self-conscious preciousness or pseudo-scholarly
    pomp, revealing instead a consistently alluring narrative vision.</p><p>
    
    Writing and producing <i>I, Lucifer</i>'s self-styled ""antique beat"" variety act, Coates also enlists some
    interesting secondary players, such as veteran British musical comedian Earl Okin on ""Bathtime in Clerkenwell"".
    ""Bathtime"", the album's most sweeping, memorable number-- something like a breakbeat ""Belleville Rendezvous""--
    layers Okin's rustic, gonzo scat over a manic rimshot and cymbal rhythm, and slips bright, swelling brass
    under Aphex Twin effects in an era-twisting Gramophones-to-headphones mashup.  This song gives Coates'
    introduction to the surreal, intriguing dream world of (The Real) Tuesday Weld, and it's an improbable
    stunner.</p><p>
    
    Coates' vocal delivery is of the subdued, Gainsbourgian variety-- he hardly sings, instead relying on his
    whispery, melodic cadence and a natural, naked delivery on songs like ""(Still) Terminally Ambivalent Over
    You"" and ""The Ugly and the Beautiful"", which exemplifies <i>I, Lucifer</i>'s lyrical sensibility: ""The
    drugs just ain't enough/ Though I like the way they made us crazy/ But love's the only drug/ That turns
    the ugly into the beautiful.""  Bolstering the vocal element, the Tiger Lilies' Martyn Jacques lends his
    crisp, quivering croon to the bittersweet ""Someday (Never)"" and French singer/guitarist David Guez fills
    the Gallic quotient with the tender acoustic ballad ""La Bete Et La Belle"".</p><p>
    
    With the help of Scottish
    alt-jazz chanteuse Pinkie McClure, Coates moves from ethereal anxiety on the Badalamenti-esque ""One More
    Chance"" to his own slick, RZA-darkened Brit-hop rap on ""The Life and Times of the Clerkenwell Kid"". ""The
    Eternal Seduction of Eve"", meanwhile, falls somewhere between a buoyant hip-hop bump and Air's vast spaces,
    with Coates lamenting like a lovelorn Joe Frank, ""From the Brooklyn Bridge to St. Petersburg/ And every
    boardroom or boudoir across the world/ From the fall of Rome to the Renaissance/ Through reformation, Cold
    War, Vietnam/ I'm waiting for you to notice me.""</p><p>
    
    Like any superior story, the variety of moods and settings <i>I, Lucifer</i> spans is inspiring.  Coates not
    only has the grand imagination and facile wit necessary to build an evocative fictional world, but he's got
    the musical prowess to keep the plot moving forward without leaving the listener behind.  An album worth
    reading.</p></div>"|6703.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6703-i-lucifer/|7.8|Jonathan Zwickel

    Pearson's manifesto on The Locust's official website.  An impressive goal, to be sure, but he's still got
    some personal obstacles to navigate before he comes close to it.  Like prog-rockers and avant-gardists
    before him, Pearson laments the prevalence of 4/4 time, sending his brief, mathy anthems through speakers
    in headspinning time signatures that any ordinary fool (myself included) would likely find unclockable.</p><p>
    
    But interestingly, despite his aim to break free of the public's preconceptions of ""what pop music ought
    to be,"" Pearson does conform nicely to all the stereotypes of underground rockers-- he even followed his
    indie rock contemporaries by commissioning a remix that turned his band's earlier, more ""uncompromising""
    work into a drill-n-bass electro rave-up at the height of that particular craze.  Chart The Locust against
    Alec Empire's superior efforts in that area and Pearson's manifesto begins to sound like the attention-seeking
    squeal of an underachieving sibling.  Fortunately, Pearson's vocal immolation produces just the kind of
    hellish shrieks loud enough to drown out his irrelevant philosophies and questionable publicity ploys,
    and force you to understand what a juggernaut his band can be when at its best.</p><p>
    
    Over the eight years since its conception, The Locust's lineup has assimilated a murky hardcore gene pool
    in which Cattle Decapitation's David Astor and The Album Leaf's Jimmy LaValle have soaked.  These black
    sheep have helped to cement The Locust's status as the <i>causes celebres</i> of the new hardcore movement.
    This newly reissued early EP features none of the band's later contributors, though, and as such, offers
    listeners the chance to ponder which approach-- the early years, or the more refined, newer incarnation--
    is more satisfyingly obnoxious.</p><p>
    
    Of course, there's one big roadblock with this release: It's saddled with a remixing/remastering treatment
    that sands down some of the original's edges.  The Locust tend to gain the most leverage when they echo
    Pearson's primal screams and mainline their ferocity through frayed studio wire and blown speaker cones.
    This edition might sound ""cleaner"" through your hi-fi, but it contradicts the rough-cut impulsion of the
    original recordings.</p><p>
    
    Still, that doesn't hinder the proceedings too much: Only a chronic migraine sufferer could imagine the kind
    of blinding misery conjured by this disc's opening 45 seconds, a little track called ""Halfway to a Worthless
    Ideal Arrangement (An Interlude to a Discontinued Sarcastic Harmony... Yea Whatever)"".  And William Burroughs
    would balk at the caustic cut-ups that form the lyrics of ""Hairspray Suppository"": ""Illness is a problem,
    not a convenience/ Sometimes things are started and never finished/ The stitch out of time never saves nine/
    Diagnosed with a fucking illness/ Rome was never built in a day.""</p><p>
    
    The song titles here are as base and scatological as their volatile contents; ""Cattle Mutilation"", ""Head
    Hits Concrete"" and ""Keep Off the Tracks"" read like the bleakest news report snapshots and hint at concerns
    deeper than Pearson's nonchalant bravado would suggest.  But trying to pick through the cacophonous
    catharsis to explore these themes is as fruitless as attempting to transcribe the explosive guitar phrasing
    that rips up the mix, leaving it bleeding and sore like a fresh suture.</p><p>
    
    A further textual analysis becomes pointless as well, since The Locust is best experienced as an entirely
    carnal, sensory experience.  Purists might prefer this earlier work to the more textured approach of late,
    but what are purists doing listening to The Locust anyway?  Contradiction and alienation are integral parts
    of the band's charm.  The bassist is wrong, they aren't going to change anything at all, and, in fact, they
    hardly even seem like they're trying.  But then, as any virus coder can attest, the most effective means to
    corrupting a system is to Trojan Horse your way in and mutate it from the inside.</p></div>"|4825.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4825-the-locust-ep/|6.0|Dan Lett

The Velvet Underground's third and Miles Davis' <i>Bitches     Brew</i> are two older records that spring to mind, and I'd toss in <i>Spiderland</i> as well. It's not a     long list, but somewhere on it belongs Boards of Canada's <i>Music Has the Right to Children</i>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Warp Records reissued <i>Music Has the Right to Children</i> worldwide, adding the bonus     track ""Happy Cycling"" (which we Americans with our Matador-licensed copies have always known as the album     closer) and redesigning the cover art as a foldout digipak.  It's always a bit strange when an album is reissued     when it has not, in any sense, ever gone away.  How could we possibly have forgotten about <i>Music Has the     Right to Children</i> when the sound Michael Sandison and Marcus Eoin created here is still the predominant     inspiration in IDM?  And yet, here we are, new package and new marketing push.  Even so, six years after its     original release is as good as any time to look into why <i>Music Has the Right to Children</i> has resonated     so strongly.</p>
<p>Boards of Canada's sound was not wholly original.  Seeds of it can be found in Eno, Aphex Twin (in a big     way), The Orb, and all over the home listening electronic scene that sprang up in the wake of Warp's     <i>Artificial Intelligence</i> compilation.  Boards used drum machines, samplers, and an unfathomable     collection of analog and digital synths, like others in their sphere.  Their chords were typically gauzy     ambient, their beats head-nodding downtempo.  Properly speaking, they invented nothing.</p>
<p>And yet, the parts had never come together quite like this.  The first thing to note is that <i>Music Has     the Right</i> revealed Boards of Canada to be geniuses with texture, where god is in the details.  The     incredibly simple melody of the short ""Bocuma"" becomes a lump-in-the-throat meditation on man's place in     the universe through subtle pitchshifts and just the right mist of reverb.  The slow fade-in on ""An Eagle     in Your Mind"" is the lonesome sound of a gentle wind brushing the surface of Mars moments after the last     rocket back to Earth has lifted off.  The long history of the electric piano was nothing but a lead-in     to the tone Boards used on ""Turquoise Hexagon Sun"", the perfect evocation of a happy walk through the     woods in an altered state.  Every IDM artist since has at least once labored over their modular unit to     get a patch that sounds like one of the many brilliant sounds found here.</p>
<p>Boards of Canada had released some singles and two EPs previous to this record's release, material which     showed that they'd already developed their sound.  But with <i>Music Has the Right to Children</i>, the     duo set out to make a proper album, and approached the album from a rock perspective, carefully mixing and     editing the track sequence, while drafting interludes and tightly restricting the palette.  You aren't     likely to hear more subtly effective layering of sounds on any electronic record in the last 10 years:     <i>Music Has the Right to Children</i> is as unified and complete they come.  Here, Boards of Canada set     their sights on a small set of moods and characteristics-- innocence, apprehension, wonder, mystery-- and     probed every possibility in minute detail.</p>
<p>What's it all about, then?  ""Childhood"" is the usual answer, but that's not as easy a connection as it     seems on the surface.  The giggling voices of kids that crop up are a sure giveaway, as are the song titles     (""Rue the Whirl"", ""Happy ""Cycling""), but <i>Music Has the Right to Children</i> avoids the twinkling music     box melodies that Múm has been coasting on for a while now.  Boards managed to evoke childhood without     seeming cute or twee.  It's childhood not as it's lived but as we grown-ups remember it, at least those of     us with less-than-fond recollections.  The shades of darkness and undercurrents of tension (qualities which     came further to the fore on 2002's <i>Geogaddi</i>) accurately reflect the confusion of a time that cannot     be neatly summed up with any one feeling or emotion.</p>
<p>When you discover that Boards of Canada took their name came from an organization committed to educational     film, the overriding idea of their project clicks immediately into place.  I've no memories of the National     Film Board of Canada but I remember tapes with narration and incidental music accompanying filmstrips, tapes     that were always damaged from age and overuse on poorly maintained equipment.  The warbly pitch and warped     voices mirrored the anxiety that came with the ""carefree"" days of being a kid and living subjugated to others.     Boards of Canada tapped into the collective unconscious of those who grew up in the English speaking West     and were talented enough to transcribe the soundtrack.  No need to get hung up on specifics; however we     lived and whoever we were, <i>Music Has the Right to Children</i> reflected back the truth for a lot of us.     You can't ask more of an album than that.</p></div>"|838.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/838-music-has-the-right-to-children/|10.0|Mark Richardson

    scuttling through the darkness, skimming tiny creatures and passing detritus
    from the water with freaky tendrils.  Why does this matter?  Well, it
    doesn't to you-- at least not directly-- but it's still something to think
    about.  While you're waiting for the Jiffy Lube crew to finish up your oil
    and filter change, any number of life-and-death struggles are occurring in
    the animal kingdom; from the bat chasing the moth to the lion in pursuit of
    the bongo, and all the way back to my favorite evolutionary holdover-- the
    nautilus-- mindlessly plucking lives much tinier than itself from the sea,
    living on perpetual autopilot.</p><p>
    
    This album reminded me of the nautili, as much of it conjures the echoing
    of distant sound through huge stretches of water, albeit with some crunchy
    drum machines added for good measure.  Australian sound sculptor John Chantler
    has his way with sines and sawtooths on <i>Monoke</i>, concocting pieces
    with a sense of drift worthy of the continental plates. ""Play. Play."" moves
    in shuddering waves over twittering programmed percussion, a wash of rounded
    sound.  The middle of the record is especially aquatic, with the lava-lamp
    bubbling of ""Autu"" and ""Vendor"". The latter is like listening to the sonar
    pulse of a modern submarine.  A thumping kick drum and something similar to
    a dot-matrix noise join deep-space pings and rhythmic, muffled returns,
    forming a truly otherworldly piece of music.  It's somewhat reminiscent of
    John Chowning's 1970s experiments with early FM synthesis that yielded a
    series of surprisingly accessible, enveloping soundscapes.  ""Slow Closure""
    ends the record in a mid-Pacific abyss of reverb and hollow, pulsing sound.</p><p>
<i>Monoke</i> is ultimately an album that falls about halfway between outright
    pop and outright minimalism: accessible but not exactly melodic, and simple
    without being especially sparse.  There are times when the liquid sonics
    don't flow as smoothly as they could.  In particular, ""Personal Rock"" is too
    thin an electronic wheeze, but on balance <i>Monoke</i> makes a nice slice
    of post-millennial electronica.</p></div>"|1740.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1740-monoke/|7.2|Joe Tangari

    ""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan"", Superpitcher's Aksel Schaufler has always been Kompakt Records'
    resident softie.  While his string of one-offs for various twelves, remixes, and Kompakt-branded compilations
    over the years have proven him master over all the Cologne label's chosen elements (microhouse, schaffel,
    pop), somewhere along the line he began to imbue his Superpitcher tracks with a warmth that made them
    unmistakably his.</p><p>
<i>Here Comes Love</i> marks Schaufler's long-anticipated debut full-length and affords him the opportunity
    to tease out the gushy, starlit house template that his output has so far suggested.  Opulent and lovestruck,
    it's a stunning record, not just for the way it decorates the Cologne sound with orange-y hues and elastic
    textures, but for the way it integrates them with a whole mess of newly introduced elements-- ambient collage,
    cabaret, and even glam.</p><p>
    We begin as we will finish, between the sheets.  Crisp and clear, the seductive ""People"" drifts along on a
    watery bell loop, a clipped 2/4 beat and a lonely mellotron line while Schaufler whirs sweet nothings that
    eventually collapse under a tangle of limpid bell tones.  As opening tracks go, it's a gorgeous beginning:
    surefooted, simple, and sweet.  What follows, however, is indisputably the album standout: With its bright
    schaffel beat and scuffled loops, ""The Long Way"" begins with a nervous edge, constrained by its stuttering
    rhythm.  Schaufler toys with that tension for a few minutes before introducing a piano line that diffuses
    it into thin air.  It's a subtle tweak but a beautiful one nonetheless, the kind of minuscule detail that
    makes all the difference in the world when songs are as wide open and as spacious as these.</p><p>
    The three-minute ""Sad Boys"" is our first hint that Schaufler may have more up his sleeve than just lovey
    variations on the Kompakt theme.  It's also the beginning of a four-song suite that sees him completely
    abandon anything resembling a house beat.  Over a moody, two-chord organ loop and a spliced-up samba rhythm,
    Schaufler cops a trick from Roxy Music and goes straight for the elegantly overblown.  ""We ain't going
    nowhere 'cause... we don't go nowhere,"" he whispers. ""'Cause... we stay right here 'cause... we are... sad
    boys for life.""</p><p>
    From there, Schaufler jumps headlong into the shimmering cabaret of ""Träume"", the only one of the album's
    nine tracks to feature vocals by someone (Charlotte Roche) other than Schaufler.  Destined to become the
    mid-morning centerpiece in many a summertime DJ set, ""Träume""'s plastic, Casiotone production and brooding,
    Weill-influenced melody line mark <i>Here Comes Love</i>'s dramatic high point.</p><p>
    And that's when things briefly go off the rails.  The next two songs-- ""Love Me Forever"" and an ill-advised
    cover of the pop standard ""Fever""-- are the album's low points.  With its jerky organ line and absent-minded
    melodies, the former is a beatless, aimless mess that temporarily breaks the spell.  ""Fever"" isn't quite as
    bad, but it does come across as clumsy and unnecessarily campy, as if Schaufler didn't trust that his original
    material would be enough to help us to locate his reference points.</p><p>
    However, not only does the album's final third restore the momentum, it also marks Schaufler's faithful
    return to deep, surging house.  Framed by a mixed bag of submerged synth sounds and clanging chimes, the
    moody ""Lover's Rock"" lumbers out of the gate before settling into a nice trot.  Better still is ""Happiness"",
    which, with its stomach-tugging electric keyboard vamp and gothic stringscape, counts as the record's
    rushiest six minutes.</p><p>
    Rather than closing out with a bang, the bittersweet disco shuffle of ""Even Angels"" unfurls itself gently,
    like a wool blanket coming undone, with a celestial reverb drone piece that accounts for at least eight of
    the track's 14 minutes.  Vaporous and sweet, it's a more appropriate end to Schaufler's doe-eyed ruminations
    than any clubfloor banger could've been.  Instead of sending us home with an abrupt kick out the backdoor,
    it lovingly parachutes us back to earth and then vanishes in a puff of goodwill.</p><p>
    In spite of its slight missteps, <i>Here Comes Love</i> is a beautifully textured, well-paced and sweepingly
    romantic record, the kind that has the swoony 18-year old in me conjuring twilight raves and beachfront

    that they've yet to play in America or even release a record outside of Japan.  The few of you who might
    have heard them wouldn't be surprised to hear me compare them favorably to bands such as Fugazi or classic
    Wire or Gang of Four.  Other names to drop would be concert partners The Locust, Ruins, and Melt-Banana.
    So, do they sound like a mathy punk band to you yet?  Well, that's not exactly the case: Yui Kimijima's
    grinding, wiry guitar figures ensure that you know exactly where they're coming from, just as Chisaki
    Taguchi's drumming spikes like broken mirror shards.  Yet they aren't spastic or crazy or whatever Japanese
    post-post-punk bands are supposed to be.  They're a band like any other you might listen to-- I only imagine
    they're not household names because most people haven't been introduced to them yet.</p><p>
    
    Of course, Gaji haven't made it very easy for people outside of Japan to find them: In order to find their
    records you have to search strange, scary Japanese distro sites (or worse, ask Japanophiles like me about
    them). I guess this harkens back to punk's original days when word-of-mouth meant as much or more than what
    the media was telling you; but in 2004, word-of-mouth seems about 1,000 times slower than an Internet
    connection.  So, please meet Gaji: Surely one of the best bands you haven't heard.</p><p>
<i>9pm at GFM</i> is Gaji's fourth full-length release, and was recorded live at the Tokyo club Grapefruit
    Moon.  It's not really a ""live album""-- there's no audience and all but one of the songs is new.  The band,
    despite initiating a new bassist, sticks fairly close to the sound of their prior releases: tight, angular
    guitar figures over almost-but-not-quite unhinged drumming.  Another way of putting it is that they play
    downtrodden post-punk at the speed of muso hardcore-- tense as hell, but not devoid of emotion.  In fact,
    <i>9pm</i> improves on their most recent album, <i>Ten to Ten Past Ten</i>, in its efficient use of
    dissonance and concise aggression, using these traits as painters use blacks and whites to sharpen archetypes.</p><p>
    
    Opener ""Sand"" begins as tentative amp fuzz and deceptive, subtle ebb from Kimijima.  When the full band
    enters like a jackhammer locomotive, it's clear this will be no ambient affair.  As it happens, though, the
    song is relatively low-key.  Vocalist Yuko Hasegawa intones passive protest with her lines.  I have no idea
    what she's saying (no lyric sheet is included), but she sounds pretty tired of something or someone.  Just
    as Yasuko O's vocals do for Melt-Banana, Hasegawa's blunt admissions serve as iron fist rhythm as much as
    melody.  As the bass grinds below, Hasegawa bleats like a cold lion, leaving very little to chance.  I
    don't normally go for the desensitized thing in vocals, but she wears it well and, in turn, helps make
    music that might otherwise lapse into pseudo-metal grandeur come out a bit more broken.  In short, she
    has a cool voice.</p><p>
    
    ""Jagg"" speeds up the tempo, but wisely trades out tension for a major mode.  Still, Hasegawa's low range
    utterances suggest dissonance even as the band surges forth like Can introduced to the industrial age.
    Similarly, the noir (yet propulsive) indie balladry of ""Fire in Hands"" would beg for melodrama along the
    lines of the most grotesque soul baring of Courtney Love, but Gaji stick close to a black curtain.  It
    stays soft when they're supposed to go soft-loud-soft, and Hasegawa stays gray when she's supposed to be
    florescent and anxious.  I wouldn't ordinarily think subtlety and introversion would be great qualities
    for a band like this, but they make it seem obvious.  And yes, when the super loud stuff happens later
    on, it fucking kills.</p><p>
    
    So if Gaji are so great, etc., etc.  Well, I can complain about the sound of this release.  Live albums are
    nice and all, but when your stock in trade is playing intricate riffs, while the vocalist has a dark-toned
    alto rather than a piercing falsetto, a proper studio mix is in order.  As it stands, <i>Ten to Ten Past
    Ten</i> is still the best introduction to the group, but <i>9pm at GFM</i> suggests that not only are
    these guys and gals for real, they're practically slept on.</p></div>"|3375.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3375-9pm-at-gfm/|8.0|Dominique Leone

The art of letter-writing gets lost in the mail, phone
    calls from three time-zones over come at the most inconvenient times, sweet words distort in signal static
    or get dropped in the middle of ""I love..."", victims to a conspiracy of star-crossed satellites.</p><p>
    
    Though the two producers here-- Japanese composer Sohichiro Suzuki (who has recorded under the name World
    Standard since 1985) and German producer Jorg Follert (responsible for an album recorded as Wunder on the
    Karaoke Kalk label, and one as Wechsel Garland for Morr Music)-- met just twice in Japan to play and
    record music together, and then filled in the spaces from their respective, distant locales, the result
    feels like they never left each other's company.</p><p>
    
    Suzuki's picking of nylon strings on ""Dande Lion Wine"" could be mistaken for lonesomeness.  He gently swathes
    it the instrument in lines of piano, chimes, harp, violins, and marimba, each additional timbre embracing
    and furthering the melody, while never quite shaking that pensive feeling.  It's not until the second track,
    when that lone guitar figure starts to flicker by the hand of Follert, that the long-distance relationship
    manifests itself.  Each producer, instead of simply recording and splitting each side of a record, passed
    their ideas back and forth between Japan and Germany, correlating their themes and expounding on them in
    their own miniatures (seven by each-- their only shared credit is the title track).</p><p>
    
    What makes the relationship work is that each partner is comfortable creating his own self-contained sounds
    while being aware of what came before and what will follow: Wechsel Garland's songs tend to be more upbeat,
    brightening the proceedings with patches of sunlight and electronics.  He tends to go for percolating pulses
    and babbling streams of digital nuances, making the first half of the album more buoyant.  When his initial
    guitar themes comes around again, he either chops them into a samba shape (""Octant"") or else gives them a
    brisk Hawaiian air (""A Found Chart""), each time new and refreshed.</p><p>
    
    Suzuki, meanwhile, is the more wistful half of the partnership, not so much melancholic as hopelessly
    romantic, and prone to spells of sweet exotica breezes.  He pens dreamier airs like ""Atoll"", with a
    reserved piano touch that fleshes out every melodic contour.  As the album winds its way down, his role
    comes to the fore, the gentleness setting the lullabies and chanteys in a peaceful sea for ""Canopy of
    Heaven"" and ""A Fire Under the Stars"".</p><p>
    
    Whether acoustic or electronic, no sound addition ever stifles the primary lonely-island feeling with
    unnecessary melodrama or overproduction.  Perhaps that's why it opened up DJ Koze's eclectic mix on
    Kompakt, and that it could embrace both the Langley School's innocence-loss as well as the click-knowledge
    of Jan Jelinek.  By the disc's sumptuous, twinkling end, Suzuki and Follert show the best way for such
    musical relationships to work out, by being sympathetic to their partner and remembering that succinct
    advice: Keep it sweet and simple.</p></div>"|8772.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8772-the-isle/|8.4|Andy Beta

    steel interludes, lyrics peppered with highways and cardinal directions, people from Connecticut asking for
    more ""gih-tahr"" in the mix.  Such ill-conceived attempts at evoking American roots music virtually always
    sound forced, if not downright stupid, and currently seem to plague so many Americana and alt-country
    releases.  From that angle, I approached <i>Small Town Murder Scene</i>, the second album from roots-informed
    Canadians the FemBots with a healthy level of skepticism, but much like Summer Hymns' beautiful <i>Voice
    Brother and Sister</i>, <i>Small Town Murder Scene</i> won me over in spite of my preconceptions.  What
    really impresses me about this record, and what sets the FemBots apart from their more derivative
    contemporaries, is how the band cultivates a truly busted ambiance without ever seeming remotely contrived
    or manipulative.</p><p>
    
    Unlike <i>Voice Brother and Sister</i>, which caught me completely off guard upon its release in 2000,
    <i>Small Town Murder Scene</i> came to me with nothing but the highest recommendations.  Darlings of the
    wildly supportive Toronto music scene, the FemBots have garnered rave reviews from local journalists,
    musicians, and record store owners, and rightfully so.  <i>Small Town Murder Scene</i> is a humble,
    thoroughly charming record-- the kind you want to tell people about precisely because it never ostensibly
    announces its own strength.</p><p>
    
    The record opens with a call to attention-- a rattle and a scream-like siren-- before segueing into the
    gorgeously downbeat ""Broken and Blue"".  The amount of open space on this record is striking, as the band
    reifies the gap between sounds to great effect.  ""Broken and Blue"" makes use of sparse guitar, reverb-soaked
    percussion, and train whistle screeches, but the palpably spatial arrangement of these elements seems to
    be the primary element holding the record together.  ""Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist"" most directly evokes
    the aforementioned Summer Hymns, with its organ high in the mix, subtle flourishes of bells, and My Morning
    Jacket-esque finale.</p><p>
    
    The FemBots continue to explore their penchant for unconventional percussion on ""A Million Dead End Jobs"",
    which follows the insistent ticking of a clock for its entire duration.  Again, a shimmering organ is
    introduced about halfway through the song, one of many subtle additions that greatly alters the overall
    tone of the song by the three-minute mark.  Only on ""Mom's Ether Blues"" do the FemBots' manipulated
    country-isms lapse into obnoxiousness, eschewing their usual melodic strength in favor of trite blues
    noodling.</p><p>
<i>Small Town Murder Scene</i> is punctuated with thoughtful instrumentals, occasionally recalling David
    Pajo's early work as Aerial M.  ""The Transit Song"" is a minimalist epic of clean and dirty electric guitar,
    piano and organ.  ""Theme from a Radio Play"" comes across like an experiment in pure texture until a blast
    of bass and drums blows it wide open.  Sometimes, the FemBots' reliance on traditional song structures
    obscures the freshness of their sound, but the effect of the overall listening experience is profound.
    Right now, it's late afternoon on an unusually nice day, and simply put, listening to <i>Small Town Murder
    Scene</i> feels just right.</p></div>"|3293.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3293-small-town-murder-scene/|8.0|Matt LeMay

    <i>Peace Love Death Metal</i>, the band sound like neither The Eagles (a relief) nor death metal.  Instead,
    the record's churning guitars and hook-driven choruses suggest a bizarro-world version of Queens of the
    Stone Age, specifically the <i>Nuggets</i>-inflected ""Another Love Song"" from <i>Songs for the Deaf</i> or
    their cover of ""Who'll Be the Next in Line?"" from the Kinks tribute <i>This Is Where I Belong</i>.  Which
    makes sense: Queens frontman Josh Homme is listed as producer on <i>Peace Love Death Metal</i>.</p><p>
    But who are the Eagles of Death Metal?  The liner notes credit J. Devil Huge on guitar/vocals and Carlo Von
    Sexron (nickname: Baby Duck) on drums/backing vocals.  Huge is apparently the stage name for J. Everett
    Hughes, a friend of Homme's from Palm Desert, CA, while Von Sexron is an alias for both Josh Homme and
    (as the nickname's initials hint) Distillers frontwoman Brody Dalle.  While the connection between Hughes
    and Homme goes way back, the band's fraudulent nomenclature and misleading identities-- along with the
    general one-off vibe of the album-- suggest that <i>Peace Love Death Metal</i> is really the sonic
    manifestation of an elaborate inside joke, in this case possibly fueled by either ""nicotinevaliumvicadanmarijuannaecstasyalcoholc-c-c-cocaine""
    or just an appreciation of cartoonish rock clichés.</p><p>
    Adopting a bluesy loverman persona that at times, intentionally or not, recalls Jon Spencer, Hughes sings
    most of the songs in a jokey falsetto that would be unbearable if he didn't occasionally dip into a
    Elvis-channeling low-end grumble.  On the lead-off track, ""I Only Want You"", he lays out his dishonorable
    intentions: ""I'm not really interested in what's in your heart/ I don't want you to fall in love with me
    so don't start.""  Elsewhere, Hughes promises that his good lovin' will leave you babbling in religious
    ecstasy on ""Speaking in Tongues"", and even offers an articulate demonstration as he sings, ""Muh-muh-muh-muh-oooh-da-galing-ling-ling-ling-da-da""
    over the bridge.</p><p>
    Backing up this self-conscious braggadocio are bundles of bandsaw riffs that add enough edgy swagger to
    skirt outright garage-rock parody.  The stripped-down instrumentation and live-in-the-studio recording
    occasionally sound thin, as if you could turn the volume all the way up to 11 and it still wouldn't be
    loud enough.  The trade-off, however, is a spontaneity and resourcefulness that adds honky-tonk piano to
    ""Wastin' My Time"", beat-keeping finger snaps to ""San Berdoo Sunburn"", and four false starts to ""English
    Girl"".</p><p>
<i>Peace Love Death Metal</i> is at its best when the inside joke is buried deep in the music, but whenever
    the deathtongue is planted squarely in the deathcheek, the songs turn not just silly, but lumbering and
    self-indulgent, overburdened by the overriding concept.  ""Kiss the Devil"" and ""Midnight Creeper"" are
    nudge-nudge exercises in rock Satanism, and ""Whorehoppin'"" seems to exist solely for its over-the-top
    chorus of, ""Shit!  Goddamn!  I'm a man!""  Similarly, the cover of Steelers Wheel's ""Stuck in the Middle
    with You"" doesn't add anything to the original that <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> didn't at least suggest; most
    likely, it's only here to provide the easy pun of retitling the song ""Stuck in the Metal"".  Nothing rocks
    like a bad pun.</p><p>
    In another post-<i>Songs for the Deaf</i> death metal side project, some-time QOTSA drummer Dave Grohl
    recreated real head-banging metal with a revolving line-up of singers and no trace of irony.  Eagles of
    Death Metal, on the other hand, try so hard <i>not</i> to sound like death metal that sometimes all you
    get is irony.  They're not resurrecting a fallen-from-grace genre or even attempting to subvert any of
    the rock clichés they indulge in; their only agenda is to have a good time, dude.  Still, while it sounds
    disingenuous compared to Probot, and the whole concept wears thin over 15 tracks, it's hard not to get
    caught up in the jovial fuck-all spirit of <i>Peace Love Death Metal</i>'s best cuts.  It may be an inside
    joke, but Homme and his cohorts, whoever the hell they are, seem to want us all to get it.</p></div>"|2903.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2903-peace-love-death-metal/|7.2|Stephen M. Deusner

    societal norms become meaningless, and everyone within a 15-foot radius has to very quickly decide whether
    the proper reaction is to guffaw through their noses or climb under a table: As innocent onlookers see-saw
    between sniggering into their hands and recognizing a real, imminent danger, said malcontent stomps and
    huffs, roars and shakes, veins popping and eyes yellowing in a ludicrous display of pumped adrenaline.
    This kind of dumb, excessive billowing is the single defining force behind most nu-metal, and probably the
    impetus for a shitload of bloody guitar solos, cymbal crashes, and ridiculous cock-rock binges.  Giggle or
    sprint.  Listen or die.</p><p>
    
    British upstarts Seachange have isolated the fiery barb behind getting retarded-mad and gently smoothed it
    over, crafting something decidedly more sophisticated (and satisfying) than their chubby, swashbuckling
    contemporaries.  The glitch is that, in the process, they've also started to sound an awful lot like
    mid-grade Idlewild, watering everything down to a soupy mix of standard alt-rock punches, complete with
    post-punk guitar zaps, the occasional folk oasis, and a requisite blanket of cloudy booze-and-bummers
    melancholy.  The confounding result: Seachange sound like the slightly better version of every mediocre
    band you heard eight years ago.  But now with a violin!</p><p>
    
    Seachange formed in Nottingham in the late 90s, and their debut long-player, <i>Lay of the Land</i>, is
    heavy with the gummy residue of pre-millennial/post-grunge angst, alternately seething and wistful, pressing
    and distanced.  Vocalist Dan Eastop spits typical rock and roll grunts over the band's thick guitar bleating,
    and his Brit clip and disaffected, vacant delivery tend to make his lyrics sound more like heckles than
    wishes.  Guitarists Dave Gray and Adam Cormack noodle and thrash, while violinist Johanna Woodnutt weaves
    quivering string melodies in and out, all three players incessantly puttering between frenzied bursts and
    thoughtful contemplation.  Meanwhile, bassist James Vyner and drummer Simon Aldcroft pump out steady
    rhythmic bits, ably gluing the whole mess together.  The resulting clash can be momentarily compelling,
    but lacks the nuance and character and to really pull it off, which all leaves Seachange huddled on the
    cusp of something significantly worthwhile, but still a few wild, miscreant swings away.</p><p>
    
    Ultimately, Seachange's biggest problem is their steadfast refusal to break formula, even for a second:
    Virtually all of <i>Lay of the Land</i>'s 12 tracks indulge the very same schematic (quiet/loud dynamics,
    guitar/violin tradeoffs, solid midtempo gunning), sometimes to successful ends, and sometimes not.  When
    Seachange are good, they're very, very good-- ""The Nightwatch"" is a haunting, thunderous success, and
    ""Anglokana"" is a violently pleasing burst-- but when Seachange are bad, they're just boring (see the
    rambling songlessness of ""Come on Sister"").</p><p>
    
    Seachange's idea to smarten up the teeth-bared tumult of neo-dude-rock could, in the future, lead to some
    genuinely impressive feats.  For now, though, listeners will have to content themselves with a generous
    handful of decently textured throwbacks.  The verdict: Don't laugh, don't run.  Just wait.</p></div>"|7752.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7752-lay-of-the-land/|5.6|Amanda Petrusich

    Germany supergroups-- The Notwist, Ms. John Soda, Lali Puna-- have maintained fairly unique personalities.
    Let's oversimplify: The Notwist remains the camp's darkest shade, preoccupied with melancholy and perhaps
    the most electronically involved.  Ms. John Soda straddles rock and pop equally, coaching chocolately sweet
    vocals and the camp's most peppermint hooks.  By analogy, Lali Puna is to riffs what Ms. John Soda is to
    melodies-- this is Weilheim's face of rock, its most outwardly energetic outfit and the closest this town
    gets to sweaty basement shows and fucking shit up wholesale.</p><p>
    
    Which doesn't say much, as Lali Puna's idea of fucking shit up on their 2001 release <i>Scary World Theory</i>
    seemed to be, at worst, breaking into a building and rearranging the furniture.  Still, at the time, the
    album's gruffest tracks offered the most aggressive sounds Weilheim's palatable pop spectrum had yet
    delivered.  And then last year, Ms. John Soda released their heavily rock-oriented <i>While Talking</i> EP,
    which, though only marginally enjoyable, branched out into harder terrain.  Now, with <i>Faking the Books</i>,
    Lali Puna snatch the Weilheim riffing crown back from Ms. John Soda-- and thankfully, even top their labelmates
    melodically.</p><p>
    
    After a pleasant but ultimately faceless title track opener, Lali Puna provide a double-shot of well-wrought
    rippers: ""Call 1-800-FEAR"" is the first, boasting a no-nonsense drive, tight instrumental harmonies and
    undistracting electronic loops that bolster the song's pulse.  Atop it all floats bandleader Valerie Trebeljahr's
    underwater vocals, processed enough so as not to sound incongruous or (gasp!) bedroomy.  ""Micronomic"", the
    album's second single, follows in similar temperament, and while not my favorite track on the album, speaks
    to Lali Puna's ability to cradle their listener gently in melody for one second, and to punch him in the
    face with a dirty riff in the next.</p><p>
    
    ""B-Movie"" and ""Left Handed"", however, are without a doubt the album's standouts, and maybe the best rock
    songs in Lali Puna's catalog.  ""B-Movie"" pulls off the Kim Gordon sing/speak that Ms. John Soda attempted
    to lesser success last year: Trebeljahr just nails that been-there-done-that apathy which works so well
    with the song's contrasting manic rock groove and pointed bass pulse.  The loud, guitar-heavy chorus of
    ""Left Handed"" steps further away from Weilheim's distinguished trademarks than the band's other material.
    Its roaring rock factor was a point of contention when it was released as the album's first single, but in
    the context of the album it doesn't seem out of place at all: The song sports similarly atonal-to-tonal
    lyric deliveries as ""B-Movie"", and remains anchored firmly by the nervous, high-pitched synth line that
    opens the song and rides it out to the end.</p><p>
    
    As for the rest of <i>Faking the Books</i>, it's pleasant, and hardly unrealized, but it falls just a bit
    too close to the IDM pop lark that takes up so much space on CD racks and FireWire drives.  And on an album
    on which this band so beautifully exceeds itself with songs like ""B-Movie"" and ""Grin and Bear"", tracks like
    ""Geography-5"" and ""People I Know"", which are content to simply be pretty, are just further proof that the
    gimmick of pairing electronic and traditional rock instrumentation has lost its edge, and that the genre
    must now rely on stronger songwriting to succeed.  That said, <i>Faking the Books</i> is a confident stride
    in the right direction, and proves that, even within the confines of a tired concept, a great hook still
    goes a long way.</p></div>"|4648.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4648-faking-the-books/|7.5|Nick Sylvester

The term, meaning a state of intense
    disorder or confusion, is commonly applied to loud bands who offer a somewhat masochistic listening
    experience.  Load Records is an unfortunate victim of this naive branding.  While many of its bands are
    excruciatingly loud, few fit the true definition of chaos.  Even Lightning Bolt, one of the most
    unrepentantly ear-splitting groups ever, are far from chaotic: Their compositions weave in and out of
    rigidly preordained constructs, stretching the taut skin of rhythm to maximum tension, yet never breaking
    it.  Noxagt are certain to be smote by the term in the wake of their second LP, <i>The Iron Point</i>, yet
    while many of the Norwegian trio's songs may be deafening, they're also often downright sublime.</p><p>
    
    Continual high-volume pummeling can be quite soothing, particularly when a band is content not to overstuff
    their songs with breakneck changes and spitfire riffage.  One more than one occasion, I've blasted this record
    on car trips, and the music has a surprisingly sobering effect.  While an epileptic band like The Locust
    certainly isn't the best thing to drive to, Noxagt's behemoth soundscapes are easy to become immersed in:
    <i>The Iron Point</i> moves as one sprawling, ambient suite, albeit composed for glottal bass, metallic
    drums and palsied viola.</p><p>
    
    While Lightning Bolt construct minimalist masterpieces by distilling the adrenal essence of rock, Noxagt's
    song structures are more finessed, and thus lose some of their intended potency.  But such gracefulness and
    attention to detail isn't always a hindrance.  ""The Hebbex"" is as anthemic as it is jarring, the stylistic
    double whammy that makes Lightning Bolt's music so toothsome.  ""Acasta Gneiss"" stutters on a spasmodic
    bassline, replete with tremolo-heavy viola and primal tom-bashing, creating a textural kaleidoscope that
    makes for one of <i>The Iron Point</i>'s most interesting moments.  ""Regions of May"", another standout,
    shows a more sensitive band influenced equally by <i>Loveless</i>-style noisemaking and more dire hardcore
    and metal acts.</p><p>
    
    ""Thurmaston"" illustrates the potentially hypnotic effect of exceptionally loud music.  Beginning with a
    spliced viola whine that sounds redolent of a weedwhacker gone haywire, the song features an unflinching
    drum rhythm that starts entropic, before being finally pinioned by a dirgeful bassline.  From there, the
    track gradually builds momentum, as the subtly mutating viola line provides the sole melodic underpinning.
    Four minutes later, not much has changed, but it's hard to imagine where the time went: Like the best
    ambient and drone music, ""Thurmaston"" seems to bend time, disintegrating our physical relation to the
    world around us.  The primary difference between this and, say, <i>Selected Ambient Works II</i>, is
    the instrumentation and volume.</p><p>
    
    A stringently singular coherence might be both this record's greatest asset and detractor.  While appreciable
    as a whole, the songs on <i>The Iron Point</i> often blend into one another, offering no significant difference
    in tempo, instrumentation or volume.  Additionally, some of the more searing numbers-- especially ""Blood
    Thing"" and ""A Blast from the Past""-- seem like throwaways: Not only do they languor in the album's sequence,
    they're downright tedious in and of themselves.  Still, <i>The Iron Point</i> has plenty of beatific moments
    within its just-right 33-minute runtime.  Like the jagged, sun-drenched slab of granite that adorns its
    cover, the album poses a striking dichotomy that limns an unconventional beauty.</p></div>"|5897.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5897-the-iron-point/|7.7|Sam Ubl

Either the producer trips, chops,
    or buries the musicians and masks the flow of their improvisation, or he stands back, letting the musicians
    run blithely past the light colors or static backdrops set behind them.  The Thirsty Ear Blue Series has
    repeatedly tried to put both sides on equal footing-- or at least to start a wrestling match-- like on last
    year's sadly dull <i>Antipop Consortium vs. Matthew Shipp</i>.  But even when the music works, you can still
    see the separation: The two camps mix, but don't synthesize.</p><p>
    
    Then there's Craig Taborn, who approached his latest album as a performer and as the producer.  It's hard to
    believe this is only Taborn's third record as a leader, and his first with electronics.  When you flip through
    his work as a sideman and keyboardist-around-town in New York City, the breadth is overwhelming.  With James
    Carter and on his own <i>Light Made Lighter</i>, Taborn is a methodically swift pianist who can solo like
    Scott Joplin's piano player plugged into the wrong voltage.  He's also acclaimed as a leading Fender Rhodes
    revivalist, blowing the cobwebs off fusion licks for Tim Berne or Dave Douglas.</p><p>
    
    But Taborn is most distinctive as a textural player.  He's said he follows the example of Sun Ra or Larry
    Young, pushing his keyboards to see what they can do for him; but Taborn uses the latest technology.  If
    the hypnotic see-sawing of ""The Golden Age""'s melody recalls the theme to <i>Close Encounters of the Third
    Kind</i>, that's just one touchstone for his digital space jazz, which also co-opts Detroit techno and dance
    beats.  But he also constructs immersive spaces, opening up rough-hewn synth backdrops or triggering a deep
    sonar ""ping"" that creates the illusion of light-eating depths.</p><p>
    
    Each track on <i>Junk Magic</i> is crammed to the gills, and then made light by the restlessness and motion
    that drive the album.  Taborn may have spent weeks constructing a machine but he gets to flick the switch
    right in front of us, and the product unfurls in real-time, even as you acknowledge the overdubbing.  This
    starts right on the opening track, where IDM chirps fly like tacks over the synth lines that pile on top of
    the piano figure and thick organ chords at the low-end-- wheels spinning within wheels.</p><p>
    
    Taborn works with a group here, although he easily outnumbers them.  Of his three sidemen, The Bad Plus'
    ""dude, holy shit, you've gotta check this guy out"" drummer David King is the chief commercial draw.  He
    gives up some freedom when he joins Taborn's cyborg army, but it's worth it to hear the way Taborn bats
    him around-- as on ""Mystero"", where he's cut up like a stop-motion photograph.  Aaron Stewart joins what
    you could call the frontline on tenor sax, but microtonal violist Mat Maneri adds the most color, sawing
    seared lines and rasping soliloquies over Taborn's precision.  The musicians submit to cameos on some
    tracks and get full-contact jams on ""Prismatica"" and ""Mystero"", and ""Bodies at Rest and in Motion"" even
    starts as a stumbling acoustic piece-- though you know it's only a matter of minutes before the digital
    insects fly back in.</p><p>
    
    Impeccable taste keeps this project on track.  Taborn sticks to one palette but never uses it the same way
    twice: Each piece is distinct, even the busiest tracks have a hook or clear melody to hang onto, and best
    of all, the record is concise, clocking in at just over 40 minutes, which leaves no time for screw-ups.
    It could've been stiff, crass, or even grotesque; instead, it's a definitive recital, and it throws down
    a challenge for the rest of the Blue Series.  We've spent several records hearing Matthew Shipp flirt with
    electronica or gently funkify his piano, and the whole time Shipp had the spotlight, Taborn was already on
    the other side of the moon.  Here's hoping people finally notice.</p></div>"|8257.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8257-junk-magic/|8.6|Chris Dahlen

Baldly transgressing the most basic assumptions about rock singers, the band's frontman is a pudgy, bearded, wild-eyed freak whose unpredictable stage show tends to scare off men and women alike. Their studio output varies from barked, discordant indie anthems to synth-heavy art-punk. And their new singles record, <em>Inches</em>, reverses all the usual rules that compilations of its ilk abide by.</p><p>For most rock bands, a singles compilation is an afterthought-- an offhanded concession to fans who may have missed out on the limited pressings. For Les Savy Fav, a singles compilation was a <em>forethought</em>, conceived before the band had even recorded a song for it. Now, seven years after its conception, the career-spanning project finally comes to fruition, collecting the A- and B-sides of nine seven-inches, all originally released by different labels.</p><p>For those who've been keeping up with these singles, the excellence of <em>Inches</em> is a foregone conclusion. While many contemporary indie bands reserve their singles for the release of marginal or subpar material, Les Savy Fav's tend to offer songs that are not only better than the band's album cuts but, despite the disparate conditions of their production, more consistent as well. For a band so prone to brilliant and exhausting outbursts, it's not surprising that their defining album would come in this form.</p> <p>And without a doubt, this is Les Savy Fav's defining album. The high points on <em>Inches</em> are not only the finest songs the group has ever recorded, but are also the most indicative of their strengths as a band. ""Our Coastal Hymn"", released in live form as a hidden track on <em>The Cat and the Cobra</em>, is possibly the catchiest song in their entire repertoire-- hook after blistering hook, all energized by the band's trademark frenetic grandiosity.  Never overpowered by its angularity, ""Our Coastal Hymn"" is less an anthemic punk song than it is a pointy anthem, unconventionally catchy and tremendously forceful.</p> <p>Tracing the band's chronology backwards, <em>Inches</em> shows Les Savy Fav continually reshaping and revitalizing their sound with new textures, and expanding their palette of both sounds and approaches to recording. The album's newest track, ""Meet Me in the Dollar Bin"", is a sparse and direct dance-punk epic, with Harrison Haynes' terse, robotic drumming perfectly anchoring frontman Tim Harrington's pained screams. Les Savy Fav's most recent LP, <em>Go Forth</em> largely failed to sustain itself, as the band's energy was substantially defused by Phil Ek's production, but <em>Inches</em>' diverse pacing allows even the Ek-produced ""Fading Vibes,"" on which the band revisits the more straightforward guitar-rock sound of their first album, to stand out as one of the best and most unique recent Les Savy Fav tracks.</p> <p>Of all the remarkable tracks on <em>Inches</em>, ""Yawn Yawn Yawn"" remains my personal favorite. Here, Seth Jabour's endlessly inventive guitar playing is in top form, masterfully and subtly building from a clean, rhythmic figure in the verse to a soaring, distorted chorus.  Lyrically, the song is further proof that Harrington has more in common with Daniel Bejar and John Darnielle than he does with his harder-rocking contemporaries. Like many of Les Savy Fav's songs, ""Yawn Yawn Yawn"" explores themes such as sex, partying, decadence and disaster.  And, as usual, Harrington relishes his words like a storyteller, delivering them with both conviction and humor.</p> <p>The first pressing of <em>Inches</em> comes with a bonus DVD that further solidifies its status as Les Savy Fav's most essential and representative release. Videos of three songs from a 2003 performance at Brooklyn's Northsix provides a welcome glimpse of the awe-inspiring Les Savy Fav live experience. Although Harrington's theatrics are usually the most frequently discussed aspect of Les Savy Fav's live show, the distance provided by the footage puts the emphasis largely on the virtuosity and spontaneity of the band's individual players. And the video of ""Who Rocks the Body"" is just fucking hilarious, as Harrington asks a stuffed rabbit, ""Who rocks the party that rocks the bunny?""</p> <p>Unfortunately, Harrington's notorious live antics have resulted in many people writing off Les Savy Fav as a joke or a novelty. And without a doubt, the band's previous recorded output has largely failed to demonstrate the musical prowess spoken of by their fans. But Les Savy Fav have always demonstrated a uniquely off-kilter sense of humor, and it seems strangely fitting that the very album their fans have been waiting for has, in fact, been underway since the band formed. With <em>Inches</em>, Les Savy Fav brings together a full seven years of solid musicianship, deviously catchy songwriting, and explosive punk rock energy, discarding all the gratuitous dissonance and convoluted song structures that often plague ""post-punk."" Finally, <em>this</em> is Les Savy Fav.</p> <p> </p></div>"|4752.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4752-inches/|9.1|Matt LeMay

No, the former child prodigy hasn't spun off this mortal coil just yet,     but Shuggie's erstwhile recording career has certainly seen better days-- and unfortunately, those days     were 30 years ago.  Back in 1974, Shuggie managed to raise critical eyebrows with his ambitious <i>Inspiration     Information</i> LP, an elegant, absorbing collage of delta blues, soul, R&amp;B;, and funk laced with the velvety     psychedelic twist of his own flawless production.  At the time, due to promotional misfirings and a fickle     music market, album sales barely registered, and a despairing Shuggie turned reclusive.  But finally, following     a 2001 reissue on David Byrne's globe-spanning Luaka Bop label, the record gained the widespread acclaim it     was previously denied, and rock's standard bearers hailed its genius at last.</p>
<p>Sadly, Shuggie's ain't the Cinderella story it could have been.  Grasping at his 15 minutes three decades     after they were due, Shuggie embarked on a major-city tour in the fall of '01, culling voracious audiences     on both coasts.  But this time, the press wasn't so thrilled-- <i>SF Chronicle</i> critic Joel Selvin called     Otis' Fillmore performance ""haphazard"" and ""inept""-- and Shuggie once again retreated from the spotlight.</p>
<p>Whether this release from Australian two-for-one reissue mavens Raven Records is a worthwhile listen for     fans of <i>Inspiration Information</i> depends on how much of a completist you are.  Raven packages Shuggie's     solo debut, 1971's <i>Here Comes Shuggie Otis</i> and its '72 follow-up <i>Freedom Flight</i> together on     one epic CD, but only <i>Here Comes Shuggie Otis</i> contains any true classics not featured on the Luaka     Bop release.  That disc added <i>Freedom Flight</i>'s four best tracks, including the cosmic funk of the     title song and Shuggie's most famous composition, ""Strawberry Letter 23"", a swirling, swinging midtempo     breeze inspired by his girlfriend's scented stationery.  ""Me and My Woman"" and ""Someone's Always Singing""     elicit Shuggie's gentle bump, but fail to merit revisitation rights.  And even though his B.B. King-inflected     guitar and deft, overdubbed bass on the instrumental ""Purple"" reveal his rootsy intuition, the song is far     from classic.</p>
<p>The liner notes, which are interesting but never revelatory, can't overstress Shuggie's youth during the     original recording of <i>Here Comes</i>, and the depth of the record's content certainly belies his 16     years: He played six instruments, sang, and co-wrote each tune with his famous father, bandleader Johnny     Otis, Sr.  Kicking off the twofer, ""Oxford Gray"" is second only to ""Freedom Flight"" as Shuggie's grandest     stroke.  Blazing guitar and harpsichord lead into a massive, stirring pizzicato-strings-vs.-slide-guitar     duel which trips through a rock 'n' soul jitterbug crowned by a elaborate orchestrated horn section.  It's     an astounding opening statement from the father-and-son team, and its heaving, soulful psychedelia rivals     even <i>Axis: Bold as Love</i>.</p>
<p>But from there, <i>Here Comes</i> becomes less focused, and its quality wavers.  ""Jennie Lee"" is noteworthy     for its gorgeous strings and horns, darkened blues guitar, and Shuggie's Alan Toussaint-esque vocals, while     ""Bootie Cooler"" brings standard Sly/Meters funk nodding to Shuggie's bouncy organ and Hammond overdubs.     Namedropping his guitar influences (B.B., Elmore, Son House), Shuggie busts into a rolling blues shuffle     on ""Shuggie's Boogie"".  Elsewhere, the rolling horn section and syncopated guitar on ""Hurricane"" provide     a gritty Stax/Volt spark, while ""The Hawks"" closes with a Memphis country funk feel.</p>
<p>Casual consumers will likely pass up this reissue like they did <i>Inspiration</i> 30 years back-- which is     probably fine, as the majority of these songs fail to add much of significance to Shuggie's discography.     Still, for groove hounds, funk archivists, and collectors, there's more than enough solid material here     to justify at least a few spins.</p></div>"|11795.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11795-here-comes-shuggie-otis-freedom-flight/|7.5|Jonathan Zwickel

    On his second proper full-length, <i>Ghost Man on First</i>, he combines Nina Simone's ""Black Is the Color
    of My True Love's Hair"" and ""Waring Cuney"" into ""A Raga Called Nina"", offers name-checking props to 60s
    folkie Fred Neil and bluegrass killer John Fahey, and covers Bert Jansch's ""Silly Woman"", a track from the
    1971 album <i>Rosemary Lane</i>.</p><p>
    
    Barker borrows his project's name from a county in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, but resides in
    Brooklyn.  Firmly lodged within the Big Apple's out-folk context, the urban hillbilly released his 2002
    debut, <i>Unpacking My Library</i>, on Mark Robinson's TeenBeat label, and also plays lead guitar for
    Aden.  From this indie rock vantage point, he could very well find contextual links to Tower Recordings
    offshoots Matt Valentine &amp; P.G. Six, as well as kindred, but less topically similar spirits Animal
    Collective and Devendra Banhart.  To avoid petty regionalism, you could draw a family tree with Six Organs
    of Admittance's Ben Chasny as well as Espers' Greg Weeks.</p><p>
    
    Of those players, his practice most faithfully corresponds to the beautifully faded standards he admires.
    As those who saw Gus Van Sant's updated <i>Psycho</i> know, this has its positives and negatives.  Though
    not opposed to experimentation-- he does sometimes tease out or expand upon particularly sumptuous threads
    of an iconic players' work-- he remains within his forebears' shadows, for the most part.</p><p>
    
    There's no doubting that Barker's one heck of guitarist, but a number of these compositions, as prettily
    intricate as they are, come off like guitar exercises rather than compelling pieces.  Cheekily, he offers
    a service through his website for eager beavers who want to learn how to play Currituck Co. songs via
    instructional videos and tablature.  Folks choose the songs (""choose any four songs and the fifth song's
    free!"") and he passes along the goods.  Ripe for this by-the-books treatment, ""Requiem for John Fahey"" and
    ""Dedication: Fred Neil"" are solo guitar pieces that sound out the smooth finger-pickers they reference.
    Similarly structured, ""The Tropics of Cancer"" brings to mind the warmth of the geographical grid rather
    than the chaotic hedonism in the texts of Henry Miller.</p><p>
    
    Despite his skills, though, I'm more a fan of the moments in which he opts to screw with expectations.  For
    instance, the crackling Eastern-flavored ""Raga Called Pat Cohn"" unrolls over nine minutes with patient
    guitar plucks, flutters, and equally rarified harmonium.  The repetitions are catchy on their own, but he
    adds a subdued vocal drone that eventually turns into actual language just as the harmonium takes on the
    crisply breezy properties of a muffled flute.  Not as digressive as Henry Flynt or as noisome as Sunburned
    Hand of The Man, the work still manages to wander admirably.</p><p>
    
    More compactly stated, the cover of Jansch's ""Silly Woman"" shares likeness with the original, but lulls in
    the vein of Six Organs of Admittance's <i>Compathia</i>.  Of the eight works, the biggest anomaly is the
    metallic ""The March of the People Who Do Not Know You"", a full-frontal distorto guitar jam that shows up
    unexpectedly just prior to the heart-achy closer, ""I Truly Understand"".  It's far from riveting, but the
    yammering guitar shield disrupts the folkie atmosphere in an interesting way, and points towards the
    different avenues Barker has at least tangentially explored more fully on other releases.</p><p>
    
    Currently, Barker's working on <i>Garden of the Deadroom</i>, which has a tentative winter release date on
    Troubleman Unlimited.  Quite obsessively, he's been honing the album since August 2002.  Of course, time
    doesn't necessarily equal quality, but it'll nonetheless be exciting to see how much weirdness he allows to
    creep in to thwart the conceptual purity of the finished product.</p></div>"|1758.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1758-ghost-man-on-first/|7.4|Brandon Stosuy

    band members are children of the late 1970s and early 1980s, and their songs of failed romance emanate from
    a shared period nostalgia.  However, they don't ape early XTC or prime Cheap Trick, for example, the same
    way Interpol echo Joy Division.  Instead, for The Bigger Lovers, these influences fall in the category of
    older-sibling bands: groups your big sister or brother played and therefore you thought had to be the
    coolest.</p><p>
    
    On <i>This Affair Never Happened</i>, the band comes across as candid and self-effacing-- as well as a
    little self-congratulatory for being so candid and self-effacing.  But beneath the back-patting and the
    reflexive jibes lies a sober sincerity.  The heartache, the romantic confusion, the almost adolescent
    hopelessness-- it's all very, very serious business.  In a sense, it's the flipside of irony: Rather than
    not caring enough, The Bigger Lovers care so much that they sometimes lose perspective.  At times this
    tunnel-vision romanticism can be endearing in a shamelessly escapist way, a tonic for life's real hurt.
    On songs like ""I Resign"" and ""Slice of Life"", they prove themselves a more-than-capable pop band.  Ed
    Hogarty's guitar cuts through with riffs that are as concise as they are catchy, as Scott Jefferson and
    erstwhile Pernice Brothers drummer Patrick Berkery maintain a strong pop momentum.</p><p>
    
    But too often on <i>This Affair Never Happened</i>, the band sounds like they just need to get over it.
    ""Blowtorch"" is a humdrum shuffle that tries to sell us lines like, ""Black coffee, booze and cigarettes/
    Have kept me running on fumes.""  And who knows what to make of the line, ""And it's hard to sleep/ When the
    shit is ankle deep"" from ""Hollywood"".  Additionally, the determinedly inconsequential ""No Heroics"" brings
    <i>This Affair Never Happened</i> to a screeching halt midway through, and the record doesn't get moving
    again until two tracks later, with the dermatological love song ""Peel It Away"".  The album ends with ""For
    Christ's Sake"", a Christmastime lament that mixes cloying coyness (""Thoughts stick to my mind/ Like head
    lice"") with a chorus (""Come back to me/ For Christ's sake"") whose cleverness undercuts its heartfelt plea.</p><p>
    
    As a follow-up to the more focused songwriting of their two previous albums, <i>This Affair Never Happened</i>
    ultimately sounds disappointing and a little hollow, with no real experience behind the sentiments.  Maybe
    if that affair really had happened, these eleven songs might pack more punch.</p></div>"|1108.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1108-this-affair-never-happened-and-here-are-eleven-songs-about-it/|6.3|Stephen M. Deusner

    his music and in his daily life.  He offers reflections on the recording of his third full-length that run
    longer than the printed lyrics in the liners and, man, does he ever rip his heart out and show it to you
    in his songs.  Matranga developed this habit with emo punks Far, but he's refined it on his own, developing
    a loose, free-roaming approach to confessional songwriting that pushes his music beyond the normal sad-sack
    singer/songwriter clichés.</p><p>
<i>The Volunteers</i> comes packaged in artwork that suggests Stephen Foster and the Civil War era more than
    the modern grab-bag it actually contains, and Matranga's liners are a good stream-of-consciousness accompaniment
    to the music, which opens with a plinking xylophone and ghostly female vocals before giving over to ""Over It"",
    a sing-along anthem which casts the personal struggle of the lyrics in a strange light.  Like most of the
    songs that follow, ""Over It"" moves from section to section seemingly when it occurs to Matranga to switch
    things up; there's no traditional verse/chorus/verse structure to anything here.</p><p>
    The meat of the album is primarily in the middle, though, as tracks three through seven swerve all over the
    road finding different ways to toy with emotions.  ""A Ghost"" follows a dead man as he watches his wife and
    son go on living, drifting through the door of his wife's bus and floating above the seats, and builds to
    a majestic conclusion wrapped in a warm blanket of synth.  Matranga's voice gets breathy and relaxed while
    hovering around Chad Waldrup's layers of spacious guitar on ""Stay"", the melody wrapping around the simple
    lyrics for the album's most transcendent moment.  But he's back to his normal croak when he opens ""We Had
    a Deal"" with the couplet, ""I had a deal with Heaven, but it fell through/ I had a dream or seven and I'm
    not sure which one came true.""  The most infectious song on the album is actually a joke-- Matranga wrote
    ""Oh, Boys"" for his girlfriend after damaging her car, and the vocal round of ""boys keep fuckin' up my car""
    in the outro is hilarious.</p><p>
    For its peaks, though, <i>The Volunteers</i> does have its lows, and it more or less trails off in the last
    quarter, especially with ""Portland?"", a revisitation of the album intro that consists mostly of a sample
    of a gas pump and some wandering keyboards.  It fades into near-silence for too long before ""As Much to
    Myself as to You"" strikes up to close out the album with its solo acoustic lament, a serviceable folk tune
    with some nice couplets, but a limp melody.  But even while it's unfortunately anticlimatic, <i>The
    Volunteers</i> is a fine record, and a welcome addition to the modern singer/songwriter canon.</p></div>"|6095.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6095-the-volunteers/|7.1|Joe Tangari

I don't know why I wanted to walk outside today anyway; it was humid
    and about to rain.  It wasn't a particularly interesting day; nothing much to see except the same old pulse
    of the same old engines zipping past me on their way to some place that could never matter.  It would have
    been a depressing day had I cared enough to pay attention.  But in fact, it wasn't depressing at all.  The
    footstep beats of those cars, and of the change in my pocket when I reach down to make sure I still have
    something to put in the newspaper dispenser, ensured that whatever wandering train of thought I carried
    didn't veer too far within.  For gray days, there is gray music, and I'm glad I brought along <i>Pasada
    Professional</i>.</p><p>
    
    Spanish DJ and modern techno producer Angel Molina has done more than his part for this kind of gray.
    <i>Pasada Professional</i> is a mix featuring artists from the Argentinean label Fragil Discos.  The
    general sound is close to the Kompakt/Force Inc. style of minimal techno, with soft house beats and
    ambient textures providing sparse color.  Of course, this is not exactly ""dance"" music, in the same way
    that Herbert's <i>Around the House</i> isn't necessarily dance music, but it comes from a similar place,
    and in these gray days, that's enough to get going.</p><p>
    
    However, unlike most microhouse (there, I said it), Molina's mix is less concerned with keeping the beat
    alive than it is sculpting ebb and flow from its sources.  As it happens, there isn't a beat to be found
    until the fourth track, and even then, you have to catch it on your own as Leo Garcia's ""Clap 4"" only
    implies it at first.  Prior to that, Molina eases into a pulse, using a high-pitched bell tone from Pablo
    Reche's ""Campanitas"" and the fuzzy, mechanical hum of Audioperu's ""Ciao Morocco"" to introduce his own fuzzy,
    mechanical vision.  Romina Cohn's ""Let's Rock (Voz)"" is straight glitch-noise growl, while Andy Love's
    ""Andy Loops"" drastically slows down a sample of Andy Warhol that some listeners will recognize from David
    Bowie's homage to the legendary pop artist.  No beats, not even gray ones.</p><p>
    
    Those don't really appear until Molina brings out his ""heavyweights,"" like Kompakt's Leandro Fresco, who
    gets two tracks on <i>Pasada Professional</i>.  ""Pol-Pol"" seems pure Cologne, despite its South American
    origins.  Imagine Kraftwerk removing the few human traits they exhibit (including playing synthesizers)
    and opting instead for bleak, almost colorless textures using only a couple of hazy loops and vinyl crackle.
    Alternatively, imagine Fennesz and Philip Jeck collaborating on a house track, vowing never to get louder
    than the doorbell.  Pommerenck's ""Diacido"" evaporates out of ""Pol-Pol"", using two watercolor chords as its
    backbone and keeping the tick-tock from the previous tune.  Fresco returns with ""Pasta de Cristal Congelado"",
    sounding relatively extroverted in comparison-- though in truth, it's merely the beautiful music of passing
    trains and sunsets.  As these samples die, so does the track, and ""Diacido"" halfway returns, removing its
    harmonic weight in favor of beat afterthoughts like missed trains.</p><p>
    
    Romina Cohn's ""Angel"" brings in an erratic glitch, like a broken Casio working just well enough to hint at
    some ages-gone programmed melody destroyed because someone left the floppy on top of the television too
    long.  It carries over into Fantasias Animadas' ""Ascensor de Aluminio"", so much so that it's hard to really
    tell where one track ends and the other begins.  Throughout <i>Pasada Professional</i>, Molina delights in
    blurring the lines between tracks, and his sense of pacing seems to favor mood and atmosphere over pure
    beatmatching.</p><p>
    
    My only complaint is his inclusion of Ocio's downtempo chill track, ""No es Palabras Escritas"", at the end,
    as it seems to jump out from nowhere.  But even so, the final track featuring only children walking and
    singing seems a perfectly enigmatic way to close a perfectly enigmatic mix.  For bright days and nights,
    there is plenty; for gray areas, <i>Pasada Professional</i> seems right.</p></div>"|5584.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5584-pasada-professional/|8.2|Dominique Leone

    originally mathy, precision-bound leanings to embrace more traditional songwriting.  As orally fixated as
    the New York hype machine is, The Double have already been on cognoscenti lips and weekly paper tips with
    biting mentions of Echo and The Walkmen.</p><p>
    However, a funny thing happened on the way to record their debut: Drummer Jeff McLeod severely fucked up
    his hand, and his cast muffled the chances of capturing the impressive punch of their live sound.  As a
    result, the band did a re-think and <i>Palm Fronds</i> was recorded while McLeod's hand healed: The band
    opted to forego the rock drumkit and instead use drum machines and loops to propel its songs. While working
    within these new parameters, both technological accidents and the freedom of creating within a studio
    setting began to stack up in oddly appealing ways as the group stumbled onto a new creative process that
    echoed Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies and the sonic permutations in their record collections.</p><p>
    ""Blanket on the Beach"" would merely be a sunny slice of bikini- and bleach-blanket pop were there not a
    melodica and acrid slush acting as an undertow, pulling the bottom out from under the band.  Similarly,
    tinny distortion eats at the edges of ""Ghost Song"", while ""Standing on a Levee"" follows the long-forgotten
    weed forestin' paths of early Sebadoh and Smog by recording a catchy pop song onto a four-track tape that
    crunches like Grape Nuts.  The disc's second half comes across like Coney Island arcane arcadia by way of
    clattering barrelhouse piano and broken merry-go-round melodies, making the tracks seem woozy without
    straying too far from their Shantytown shack rhythms.  The best mashed imagining is ""Firecrackers in
    Sawdust"", which could be the ghost of Ian Curtis channeled through Keith Hudson's Kingston studio-- all
    aslant rhythms and stumbling echoes falling into a brittle balance.</p><p>
    As those who remember Catsup Plate's Black Dice, French Paddleboat, Destroyer, and Animal Collective releases
    can attest, the label's handmade packaging reflects all their records' irregular layers.  Here, a water-painted
    wraparound hides a jewel case of swirling foliage in sloppy bloom, just as naïf noises obscure and heighten
    the pop highs that lie at the bottom of The Double's concrete jungle.</p></div>"|2552.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2552-palm-fronds/|7.7|Andy Beta

Yet another British band appropriating the
    amateurish DIY clatter and plaid-shirted heartache of the American Midwest, the group echoes the sounds
    of mid-1990s U.S. rock, artists reared on the commercial juggernaut of grunge who coupled the distorted
    dynamics of Nirvana to the more sensitive, roots-tinged sound of The Replacements, Pavement, and Uncle
    Tupelo.  To that end, <i>Summer of Mars</i> seems a good decade out of date, but this Scottish act's
    second full-length is still a pleasant bit of nostalgia trading.</p><p>
    
    Of course, that's not an impression one would get from its god-awful opening title track.  With a bone-headed
    bass riff and frontman Paul Smith's innocuous, say-nothing vocals, the band initially seems to be timidly
    trying to tag themselves onto the tail end of the current garage revival fixation.  Not only does it offer
    a ghastly first impression, it's also incredibly unrepresentative of the album's overall sound.</p><p>
    
    The rest of <i>Summer of Mars</i> is mostly acoustic fare peppered with occasional shards of amp-shredding
    noise.  And since Vera Cruise are neither great nor particularly inventive, they wisely rely on their ability
    to deliver their songs on an emotive level: The slow strum of ""Glaciers""-- dressed in slide guitars and
    close harmonies, with Smith's laconic voice dwelling on past failures (""I know I did the wrong thing just
    to be here by your side"")-- is reminiscent of <i>Being There</i>-era Wilco.  It's this sweet-natured,
    shirtsleeve-tugging honesty that stands as the record's finest quality.</p><p>
    
    On the whole, this angle works pretty well.  ""This Is a Fuse"" litters lyrics like, ""This is my heart; don't
    fuck around,"" above tight, Replacements-style guitar chords and furious drumming, while ""The Pact"" slowly
    evolves from sparse and tactless piano chords into a pretty, full-bodied country ballad.  Of course, it's
    hardly a remarkable piece of work, but in the face of tiresome sub-grunge dirges like ""Step Right Up and
    Meet the Lame"", with its shifts from charmless distortion to weak-limbed jangle, and a handful of unremarkable,
    workman-like offerings, it fares reasonably well.</p><p>
    
    Judged against a music scene of thrilling, Technicolor diversity, <i>The Summer of Mars</i> simply skulks
    in the shadows.  There are no new ideas, and much of the material here can be sourced back to a few great
    bands that did it with much more skill, passion, and urgency.  Nonetheless, when judged on their own terms,
    Vera Cruise have produced a good collection of songs full of sunken hope and stained dreams, which manage
    to swell with empathy and emotion in spite of their trad leanings.</p></div>"|8530.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8530-the-summer-of-mars/|6.9|Neil Robertson

Maybe it's the fear of a looming
    backlash that drives artists to cram as much diversity as possible into their records, but while this often
    shows that an artist is capable of working within more than just one sonic realm, it also frequently results
    in an unfocused end product.  Some producers come close, but fall just short of perfecting that delicate
    balance, lacking the kind of important, subtle changes that keep listeners listening.  But then there's
    DJ Signify, a New York-based producer whose debut album is a singularly dark, instrumental clinic which
    manages to maintain its unique identity while shifting styles within similar contexts.</p><p>
    
    As with any master beatsmith, DJ Signify counts subtlety among his greatest strengths, using his backdrops
    to lend depth and color to his stories.  Throughout the album, his drumwork is staggeringly confident, in
    some cases creating counter-melodies around his samples, while halting for emphasis in others: After Buck
    65 drops his verse on ""Winters Going"", the drums detach from the guitar loop, a vocal sample enters briefly,
    and a different set of more prominent beats suddenly enter to dominate the soundscape.  A less patient
    producer might have run that vocal sample into the ground, but Signify wisely employs it just once, at the
    end of the track, to hit his point home.</p><p>
    
    But while he may seem to have an affinity for an approach based on the purest elements of the art, Signify
    exhibits many styles throughout <i>Sleep No More</i>.  Whether he's using sinister carnival funk and 60s
    bell tones on ""Peekaboo Part 1"", vulnerable icy keys and heavy drums on ""Where Did She Go?"", or a processed
    yet organic pulse and stuttered synth stomps on ""Peekaboo Part 3"", Signify manages to make even unlikely
    sounds feel like they belong.</p><p>
    
    The big selling point for many will be the involvement of two of the underground's biggest magnates, Sage
    Francis and Buck 65.  Francis' contributions are all slightly tilted to themes of unfulfilling adulthood
    and relationships (""At night, I'm more than certain, she hurts inside from all this shit/ Drawing a curtain,
    blurring the line before crossing it"") that wouldn't have been out of place on his <i>Personal Journals</i>,
    while Buck 65 strings together a David Lynch-esque story-in-reverse.  And while it may seem like a bad idea
    to pair two loosely affiliated Anticon rappers with vaguely Anticon-esque beats, the emcees never stilt the
    continuity of the album, and in fact, leave you wanting more.</p><p>
    
    Buck 65, whose key strength lies not in his flow or delivery, but in his lyrics and storytelling, delivers
    the standout performance on ""Stranded"".  Dictating to a mindblowing beat backed by a glitchy metronome
    drumline, fuzzy synth, subtle chimes, and even a saxophone solo, Buck 65 uses his incredible power of
    description to put the listener inside his story.  Here, he introduces us to a hotel owner that ""looked
    like Peter Fonda and smelled like Jack Daniels"" and a room with ""a sign above the toilet that said 'Don't
    flush your needles,'"" closing with the memorable couplet, ""Unable to speak, our thoughts were in brackets/
    We called it a night and slept in our jackets.""</p><p>
    
    Opening with concurrent waves of distortion, the strongest individual beat comes with the Nick Drake-referencing
    ""Five Leaves Left (For Lauren)"".  Though initially framed by monarchial fanfare with scratches and a classic
    boom-bap, the sequence quickly shifts to a chopped choir, invoking the work of both Sixtoo (who engineered
    <i>Sleep No More</i>) and Non Prophets producer Joe Beats.</p><p>
    
    Of course, like most records, <i>Sleep No More</i> isn't without its share of misses: The jarring sound
    experiment ""Shatter and Splatter"" disrupts the album's flow three-quarters in, while the six-minute closer,
    ""Breathe"", doesn't offer enough variety to justify its lengthy scratch solo.  Nonetheless, two misses out
    of 17 makes for a pretty solid ratio, and all told, <i>Sleep No More</i>'s brilliant journey into
    sample-based experimentation easily places DJ Signify in a league with the genre's best-known producers.</p></div>"|2551.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2551-sleep-no-more/|8.7|Rollie Pemberton

Blue cocktail napkins, sticky and
    balled, float in partially consumed cups of apple juice.  Shreds of wrapping paper and ribbon dot the
    lawn, abandoned sacks of loot topple over into the flower bed, candy necklaces and pink rubber balls
    slowly spill into the topsoil.  Children run at full speed, in every direction.  And on a cheap portable
    stereo, Architecture in Helsinki's debut, <i>Fingers Crossed</i>, starts to spin, each bit of gleefully
    bizarre pop somehow blending perfectly into the haphazard hollers of cake-stuffed toddlers, mirroring
    their soft mania, providing what might be the only appropriate soundtrack to a throwdown attended
    exclusively by knee-high tots no longer wearing their shoes.</p><p>
    
    While goofy backyard birthday parties have long been rendered formulaic, chalked up as another standardized
    offshoot of American minivan culture, <i>Fingers Crossed</i> is an oddly surprising invention, curiously
    unparalleled and quietly compelling: In a rapidly changing landscape, it's rare to stumble onto a record
    that actually sounds new, and Architecture in Helsinki have managed to take ""neo-psych"" to entirely
    unforeseen levels of blippy eccentricity.  Ultimately, what's most disarming about the band's brand of
    blissful musing is that it's so stupidly pleasant to listen to: Melding lilting harmonies, sweet,
    high-pitched synthesizers, tittering percussion, and assorted woodwinds, Architecture lay out a weird
    and whimsical electro-pop buffet, effortless yet perplexing.</p><p>
    
    A collective of eight Australians (five men, three women), Architecture tote around a massive pile of
    gear-- xylophone, flute, four different kinds of guitar, glockenspiel, trumpet, tuba, trombone, assorted
    synths, melodica, thumb piano, clarinet, recorder, bass, and various drums, their tinny din augmented only
    by a mess of vocals (including contributions by some craggy-voiced kids), handclaps, tap dancers, and
    finger snaps.  It's impossible to understand the group without understanding their pile of stuff and the
    penchant for tinkles and beeps it so blatantly implies; despite employing more than thirty noisemakers and
    a diverse choir of age-ranged voices, <i>Fingers Crossed</i> manages to end up sounding excessive and
    slight at the very same time.  The combination is beautifully baffling.</p><p>
    
    Credit the band's songwriting prowess: ""The Owl's Go"" is <i>Fingers Crossed</i>'s brilliant creative apex,
    an insane and addictive menagerie of sounds, melodies, and gleeful circus bits-- listening feels a little
    like cracking open the mind of a manic-depressive in full-on hysteria, climbing inside while he shakes
    with joy, elated to the point of drooling.  The track starts with a whispered two-voice countdown, figures
    tap-shoes-and-finger-clicks-as-percussion, and then positions flute, jangly guitar, finger snaps, xylophone,
    a smattering of boy/girl voices, shouting children, and sighs as prominently as possible.  While the rest
    of <i>Fingers Crossed</i> never quite matches this high, there are other notable moments: ""Fumble"" is a
    goofy-but-engaging tuba-heavy celebration, and ""Like a Call"", with its muted beats and meandering bassline,
    is an inadvertently touching promise.</p><p>
    
    But just as benign backyard clowns have earned a spot in pre-adolescent nightmares, there's something sort
    of terrifying about Architecture in Helsinki's strung-out ecstasy.  The band's incessant squeaking could
    make <i>Fingers Crossed</i> become vaguely unbearable, overwhelming in its promise of total, uncompromised
    happiness.  Still, like any good birthday binge or uncanny high, it's worth the hangover.  You might swear
    you'll never touch it again.  But you so will.</p></div>"|440.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/440-fingers-crossed/|8.2|Amanda Petrusich

    stirring the cauldron into a frenzy of seizure-inducing mayhem.</p><p>
    
    Mochipet is Taiwan's David Wang, who made his name with self-released original material he'd send free in
    CD-R form to anyone who requested it from his website.  Following his second CDR release-- <i>Randbient
    Works 2002</i>, which was released just as his idiosyncratic esoterica began to see recognition in the
    underground-- Wang was offered the opportunity to cut a 12"" for Ellen Allien's Teutonic imprint,
    Bpitchcontrol, and happily took on the staggering workload that comes with the territory for electronica
    auteurs.  Now there's <i>Combat</i>, his first official full-length, which comes courtesy of the Tigerbeat6
    label's mischievous subsidiary, Violent Turd.</p><p>
    
    Here, Wang epitomizes the revisionist tendencies inherent in his genre, and produces surreal distortions
    and grotesque caricatures of some of music's most established institutions, from Yes to DJ Qbert.  But
    Mochipet is no common mashup artist: Here, he complicates that formula by selecting source material purely
    via word association.  Those of you who might balk at the uneasy pairings of Barry White with The White
    Stripes, or Captain Beefheart with Captain &amp; Tennille may be alarmed to imagine Mochipet's own tireless
    techno battery scaffolding such unsteady constructions.  But relax: <i>Combat</i> is a riotous, hilarious
    success.</p><p>
    
    After the introductory megamix of ""Mochi vs. Soulseek"", in which Wang prepares us for the maelstrom to
    come by borrowing from Rod Stewart, Destiny's Child and Vanilla Ice, the bombastic party-scape of ""Wang
    Chung vs. The Real Wang"" reveals an infectious enthusiasm for juxtaposition.  But ""Johnny Cash vs. Cash
    Money Millionaires"" is the kicker, treating the originals with affection and intuitive invention.  Here,
    Wang coaxes humor and optimism from Cash's ghostly vocals, doing no disservice to a legacy he could so
    easily have offended.  ""Aphex Twin vs. Thompson Twins"", meanwhile, finds <i>Combat</i> at its most perverse.
    A cheekily crooned rendition of ""Come to Daddy"" degenerates into an unruly musical brawl as Wang's wacky
    interpretations overlap psychotically in a glorious flourish of creativity.</p><p>
    
    At worst, this record can be frivolous (see the banal but mercifully brief ""Thundercats vs. The Stray Cats"").
    Some may also scorn the lack of structure which hovers over the proceedings, threatening to break up these
    strange marriages, but I'd argue that in such scattered sensory eruptions, Mochipet tends to incites the
    maximum incredulity and hilarity in his listeners more often than not.  Naturally, of course, there are
    exceptions: ""Barry White vs. The White Stripes vs. White Lion"" can be oppressively jerky, despite offering
    an amusingly discordant vision of 70s, 80s, and contemporary pop.  And ""Neil Diamond vs. King Diamond vs.
    Lion King"" is an unsettling carousel that reels drunkenly before slamming into the ghost train, ending the
    album on a mysteriously callous cackle.</p><p>
    
    Sonically, <i>Combat</i> pushes few boundaries, but does revel in an obsessive pop fascination that
    playfully upsets all preconceptions.  Perhaps the album's most disturbing moment-- a candid reproduction
    of Captain &amp; Tennille that escapes unmolested for one entire, terrifying minute-- best illustrates how
    gripping Mochipet's relentless showmanship can be.</p><p>
    
    Indeed, <i>Combat</i> is too involving to be considered pure mockery, too self-involved to be simply a
    tribute.  But maybe <i>Combat</i> is best-described as a sort of deranged karaoke.  Wang plasters himself
    all over the guilty pleasures in which he so degenerately indulges.  As such, this record is best enjoyed
    by the drunk and the whimsical, all of whom should be prepared for one stupefying, maniacal experience.</p></div>"|5583.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5583-combat/|7.8|Dan Lett

    alone.  I experienced an aesthetic connection with that minimal ambient record that is arguably the sole
    reason art exists.  An artist creates something that is his way of saying: ""You know how __________ and
    __________, and it feels like __________?""  And I play the CD and-- despite his communicating with music
    rather than words-- I'm able to say, ""Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.""  The space between us is
    diminished.</p><p>
    
    And yet, <i>Playthroughs</i> gave me a sense of isolation because I felt as if no one else heard in it
    quite what I did.  I received a number of e-mails from readers about my <i>Playthroughs</i> review telling
    me that ""there was no <i>there</i> there"" and I was just pretending to like it to be cool or deep or
    something.  Others readers went as far as claiming that anyone with half a brain and a single finger could
    make that album.  Plenty of people did like <i>Playthroughs</i>, but to most of them it was just an ambient
    album among many ambient albums, a bit more skeletal than most, perhaps, but nothing to go crazy over. I
    maintain that there were a million ways <i>Playthroughs</i> could have been different, but very few ways
    it could have been better.</p><p>
    
    To tide us over to the next Whitman full-length, <i>Multiples</i>, Kranky offers the vinyl-only
    <i>Antithesis</i> EP, which contains four worthy tracks that didn't fit the new full-length.  The
    <i>Antithesis</i> material is very much an odds-and-sods hodgepodge: four pieces recorded over a span
    of eight years in different home studios with widely variable set-ups.  All of the tracks are instrumental
    compositions created by layering traditional sounds like guitar, feedback, keyboards, and percussion,
    without computer sources or digital processing.</p><p>
    
    ""Twin Guitar Rhodes Viola Drone (For Lamonte Young)"", recorded in 1994, is the oldest of the pieces, and it
    fittingly has a shoegaze feel.  Although Young is namechecked, the feedback hum and recurring three-note
    suggestion of I/IV/V chords are pop tropes, far from gallery-presented art music.  The song has a unique
    melancholy vibe coupled with a sense of endlessness, as if it could continue to unspool forever.  And its
    primitive-sounding recording places its aural space in the vicinity of where Windy &amp; Carl and Flying Saucer
    Attack were in 1994, with a bit of VU/Theater of Eternal Music viola folded in.</p><p>
    
    ""Obelisk (For Kurt Schwitters)"" is from 1997 and would have fit on one of the <i>Storm</i>/<i>Swarm</i>/<i>Throne</i>
    drone compilations Asphodel released around that time.  With echoing bits of tribal percussion and held
    tones that sound as if they're disappearing down some mantle-bound cavern, ""Obelisk"" is not far from the
    dark ambient of Steve Roach.  ""Rhodes Viola Multiple"", from 1995, is closest in sound to <i>Playthroughs</i>,
    with an overlapping series of keyboard throbs that combine with guitar feedback into a constantly shifting
    drone.</p><p>
    
    The closing ""Schnee"" is a timeless and terrifically evocative piece of music, one that sounds uncannily
    like vintage krautrock.  I've heard comparisons to Ash Ra Tempel, but it sounds more like Popol Vuh doing
    soundtrack work for Werner Herzog.  Its ancient, blurry guitar tone and endless cascade of cymbal reference
    a time when psychedelic rock was tightly bound to the medieval, a connection exploited to maximum effect
    by Genesis and Gentle Giant.</p><p>
    
    Each time Whitman offers a glimpse of what <em>else</em> he's been up to in the past 10 years, we get a
    deeper understanding of his impressive range.  He started out as an impressive drum-n-bass beat technician
    and then experimented with minimal ambient music to unveil some worthwhile instrumental rock-ish sounds.
    And to think, I once thought of this dude only as the guy who wrote the witty and informed blurbs on
    German electronic music for the Forced Exposure catalog.</p></div>"|8661.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8661-antithesis-ep/|7.7|Mark Richardson

    beard to obscure his baby face.  Without his ragged mountain-man facade, de Dionyso's distinctive voice
    lacked its familiar context; instead of an unhinged woodsman chopping demons, a bespeckled indie-rock geek
    spat possessed tongues, hillbilly ire, and the gurgling howl of a vampiric Jon Spencer.  To confuse things
    further, this end-times preacher was swaddled in a red sweatsuit emblazoned with ""Oriental is the world
    famous country"" and accompanied by a picture of Italy.  I really love these disjunctions: Ted Bundy didn't
    resemble a killer, pre-makeover Clay Aiken was an unlikely pop star, I can't believe it's not butter.  As
    I saw it that night, this figure somehow swallowed a maniacal banshee who flooded the club with its angry
    presence whenever this sorcerer opened his mouth.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps due in part to my confused expectations, Old Time Relijun was unstoppable that night-- an endless
    well of Beefheart goodness.  ""Cold Water"", from <i>Lost Light</i>, was especially propulsive, constructed
    with an extended build-up and an eventual shout-along of the song's title by new double bassist Aaron
    Hartman and drummer Rives Elliot (the latter replacing The Microphones' Phil Elvrum) before de Dionyso
    ended the set with an extended jaw harp solo.</p><p>
    
    There are no jaw harp or solo excursions on Old Time Relijun's fifth album-- it's all about teamwork (well,
    that and storytelling).  An intense 30 minutes, <i>Lost Light</i> features the band's catchiest, most
    filled-out songs to date-- a sure-footed treat after the unevenness of 2003's rarities collection,
    <i>Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, whose lack of narrative pull was its primary weakness; as
    if Old Time Relijun are responding Roxanne-style to my prodding, <i>Lost Light</i> is a goddamn concept
    album.</p><p>
    
    At first glance, <i>Lost Light</i>'s song cycle seems to document an estrangement from innocence (or Eden).
    Complicating this otherwise easy read is an Olympic-sized pool of water imagery-- amniotic fluid, rivers,
    rain-- as well as an endless quest, oral sex as ablution, Blakean naturalism, the gnashing of teeth, and
    addictive poison (I'm thinking Bel Biv DeVoe).  Upon closer inspection-- and with the help of ""Dark of the
    Male, Light of the Female"" from 2001's <i>Witchcraft Rebellion</i> for imagistic explanation-- it's more
    about old-fashioned love.  That's an interpretation that's backed by de Dionyso himself, who told me via
    e-mail: ""My songs use the language of alchemy and dreams to find new (and ancient) ways of talking about
    love-- the entire process of having, losing, finding, rejecting, coming to terms with, being in love.
    <i>Lost Light</i> tells the classic story of the Shaman's Soul Retrieval.""</p><p>
    
    Amidst that dense tale, Old Time Relijun twist and shake the three-minute pop song.  Banged together with
    Thinking Fellers Union Local #282's angular and unhinged guitarissimo, album opener ""The Door I Came Through
    Has Been Closed (But I Keep Trying)"" mutates as it swivels, swings, and saves.  It also announces de Dionyso's
    Proclaimers-like intentions: ""I walk the streets of the city/ I walk alone in the city/ I keep trying to/
    Find you.""</p><p>
    
    The previously mentioned, ""Cold Water"" is a swift eight minutes: De Dionyso tracks a vision quest, water,
    and himself through trees, roots, mud, rock, soil and sand.  The instrumental ""Music of the Spheres"" chimes
    with the confusion of a flood-zone and ""Cold Water, Deep Underwater"" is a chill-out sans vocals with wrangler
    gee-tar and precisely constant water torture drumming.  ""The Rising Water, The Blinding Light""-- with lines
    such as, ""Devil and the angels making eyes at each other/ They wanna be inside of each other""-- feels like
    Flannery O'Connor damnation as sexual come-on, a crazed monological call-and-response of dizzying spells
    invoking Nick Cave.  The album even ends with a reference to rock's most-famous lovers, John and Yoko, via
    the ""put down your sword"" of the joyful ""War Is Over"".</p><p>
    
    Critics mention a musician's parent's occupation when it adds to or helps create a mythology.  With that
    shop secret in mind, de Dionyso was raised in Arkansas and Spokane, WA as the son of Methodist ministers.
    And <i>Lost Light</i> is his most confident, explosive sermon.  When a band this manic attempts concision
    while still working within its raging form, the ideal result is a super-tight documentation of howling
    at the moon.  <i>Lost Light</i> has that swagger.  As the poem inside the album suggests (""I'm the kind of
    king that likes the night/ Ashes and dust are my glittering crown/ I found my queen/ I go down/ For my
    underground queen""), this is a cracked, art-rock <i>Odyssey</i>, a collection of warped hillbilly booty
    jams for folks who've misplaced something and want like hell to find it.</p></div>"|5972.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5972-lost-light/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

    because of any silly aversion to religiously themed music or a discussion of faith, but because talking
    at length about them seems to force deeper meaning upon them than they seem intended to carry.  Copious
    mentions of Jesus and Mary in both the titles and lyrics on this EP aside, Cambridge, England's Broken
    Family Band aren't playing devotionals here, nor are they offering any particular critique of Christianity
    or religion in general; rather, Jesus appears to be just another vehicle for the quartet's Appalachiophiliac
    explorations of love and loss, and the effects of alcohol on one's senses of balance and abdominal fortitude.</p><p>
    
    So basically, what you have is a four-piece British Americana band who aren't afraid to have a little fun
    with the #1 Son, and is that really so wrong?   Well, when the music is this ingratiating, it certainly is
    not.  Even at their nadir, their puzzlingly straight cover of Neutral Milk Hotel's ""King of Carrot Flowers,
    Pts. 2 &amp; 3"", these guys display an infectious energy and beery exuberance that marks them as nothing
    if not endearing.  Plus, they had the decency to ask Jeff Mangum if they could kill his song before they
    went and did it, and you have to respect that.</p><p>
    
    Oddly, wonderfully, The Broken Family Band actually call to mind the captivating weirdness of Neutral Milk
    Hotel more on a couple of their originals than they do on their cover.  Vocalist Steven Adams' tumbling
    syllables on ""Mother o' Beauty"" nod to Mangum's ""Song Against Sex"", and the jumble of pep and melancholy in
    the music are in aesthetic harmony with <i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i>.  Still, it's not a mere
    knockoff: The lyrics function as a letter from home, running off a litany of boring family trivia like
    ""Dave got a cold/ And Sally got married,"" but the choice of phrases reflecting longing and distance turns
    it profound, the way Ray Davies used to be able to turn domestic dreariness into epiphany.</p><p>
    
    The backbone of the EP is the ""Walking Back to Jesus"" trilogy, three distinct songs that use the title as
    a hook in completely different contexts.  The first opens the disc with a pensive, one-chord skulk, building
    to a distortion-soaked climax like none other in the band's catalog-- it's the only hint here that bassist
    Gavin Johnson was once a member of tragically short-lived post-rockers Gwei-Lo, and it's a suitably ass-kicking
    opener.  The acoustic guitar and banjo of the middle installment have a decidedly different tone, and Adams'
    easy delivery belies his pained soul-searching, flowing swiftly into the refrain of ""I am not your only son,
    but I am equal to whichever one you compare me to.""  ""Part Three"" is the strangest, a slow bob over accordion
    and Mick Roman's two-stepping drums joined near the fade by a Welsh male voice choir.</p><p>
<i>Jesus Songs</i> is The Broken Family Band's third major release, after a full-length and an EP, and it
    proves their mettle as transatlantic style-hoppers, as well as fine songsmiths.  People looking for some
    sort of religious experience, either musical or lyrical, aren't going to find them here, and by the same
    token, folks who cringe at the merest whiff of Christian Coalition evangelizing have nothing to fear from
    these guys.  What listeners will find is some solid Anglicized country and a band to keep an eye on.</p></div>"|1107.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1107-jesus-songs/|7.9|Joe Tangari

    EP, <i>Indestructible Object</i>.  Hard to believe it's been that long.  Across more than two decades, the
    duo-- Johns Flansburgh and Linnell-- have parlayed their silly sense of whimsy into a surprisingly bankable
    commodity, stretching what could have been merely a novelty act into an enviable career marked by consistent
    output and a highly loyal fanbase.  Furthermore, they've quietly challenged the way pop music is created and
    disseminated through their Dial-a-Song project, their soundtrack to the 7th issue of the literary magazine
    <i>McSweeney's</i>, and their collaboration with Marcel Dzama on the children's book <i>Bed Bed Bed</i>.
    Even more impressive than this array of media, however, is the range of genres they've mastered and the
    ease with which they can flip through their musical Rolodex, find an interesting style, and introduce it
    into a song without seeming like dilettantes or stuntmen.</p><p>
<i>Indestructible Object</i> is no great departure for the Giants, but it does provide a fitting illustration
    of their all-over-the-map approach to making music.  The lead-off track, ""Am I Awake?"", with its logic-problem
    lyrics (""The coffee's cold/ Did I forget to drink it yet?""), floats by in a haze of drum loops that suggest
    a mildly existential Postal Service nodding off at work.  ""Memo to Human Resources"" backs away from the
    laptop production even as it explores a similar theme of work- and world-weariness: ""I'm busy taking stock
    of all the things I've forgot/ And making mental notes of just exactly where I lost the plot.""</p><p>
    
    If these first two songs sound a little darker than the Giants' recent fare, then ""Au Contraire"" and ""Ant""
    set things back in place.  The former namedrops David Bowie (bonus points for calling him ""Dave""), Franklin
    Delano Roosevelt, Jodie Foster, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Mahatma Gandhi.  After a groovy flute solo by
    Doug Wieselman, it ends in a hearty round of ""right on""'s straight out of a 1950s Beat club.</p><p>
    
    ""Ant"" begins like a children's song, with soft vocals and cartoonish lyrics about an ant crawling up your
    back and nestling in your ear while you're asleep.  A tuba joins in on the second verse, oompah-ing a simple
    bassline.  This, however, quickly morphs into a brass band playing ""Hail to the Chief"", then into the house
    band for Rowan &amp; Martin's <i>Laugh-In</i>, and the song explodes into a brass-versus-synths freakout.  As
    the horns run amok, the lyrics grow gradually more political, while the ant becomes president and sends men
    to ""ransack your house in the nighttime.""  The conclusion is grim and somewhat accusatory-- ""But you think
    that's okay while you're sleeping""-- but political dissent rarely sounds like so much fun.</p><p>
    
    Coming after the mayhem of ""Ant"", the Giants' faithful cover of the Beach Boys' ""Caroline, No"" sounds too
    staid and inconsequential.  Brian Wilson's lament seems to rein in the very qualities that make the rest
    of <i>Indestructible Object</i> so charming and memorable: the play of musical ideas that mask, but never
    obscure, deep discontent, and the buried emotions that give shape to the musical experimentation.  When
    allowed to wreak havoc, these tendencies continue to steer the band away from short-lived novelty and give
    their music meaning beyond the formal exercises.  Right on.</p></div>"|7999.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7999-indestructible-object-ep/|7.1|Stephen M. Deusner

    serious scholarly debate.  Dissertations and books have been devoted to the potential feministic undertones
    of movies like <i>Halloween</i> and <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street</i>.  Carol Clover's <i>Men, Women and
    Chainsaws</i> (1993)-- one of the premiere works on the subject-- posited the notion of a so-called Final
    Girl in slashers as a bastion of feminine righteousness.  According to Clover, while all the other tramps
    are getting hacked during or following a casual sexual encounter, Final Girl abstains from illicit behavior,
    and ultimately avoids death.  Our heroine is cloistered, bookish, and androgynous-- in short, a shameless
    feminist stereotype.</p><p>
    
    But well-intentioned or not, slasher films are often crass and inelegant-- and, as the adage goes, it's not
    what you say; it's how you say it.  Fortunately, <i>Bad Thriller</i>-- the third album from French synth-hop
    daemons Abstrackt Keal Agram-- possesses more urbanity and verve than almost anything in the slasher canon.
    One thing <i>Bad Thriller</i> shares with its namesake film genre is a homespun, low-budget aesthetic.  And
    the three-note acoustic guitar arpeggio and conjoining synth melody at the beginning of its title track
    sound hauntingly like a prelude to a gory murder-- but that's where the similarities end.</p><p>
    
    While Abstrackt Keal Agram's previous full-length, <i>Cluster Ville</i>, dwelt in dour monotony, <i>Bad
    Thriller</i> is a sufficiently more upbeat affair, featuring a handful of radiant melodies (case in point:
    M83's remix of AKA's song titled for Grandaddy's frontman, ""Jason Lytle"").  And while songs like ""Street
    Lamp Confessions (Ghost Version)"" and ""Yo, Rap!"" affirm Abstrackt Keal Agram's penchant for angular beats
    and turntable stylings, the group's addition of fragile acoustic guitars to their craggy synthscapes,
    adoption of a more diverse approach to songwriting, and tendency to sing (in often hushed vocals) as often
    as they rap make this album more well-rounded than its predecessor.  ""Delta Force"", in particular, shows
    the sophistication and hopefulness missing from <i>Cluster Ville</i>: After a gloomy, disjointed opening
    section-- over which guest vocalist Poor Boy slurs double-tracked vocals like, ""When you wake up, you feel
    so tired/ Destroyed by the rules of time""-- the song performs a sly turnabout with gorgeous synth glides
    augmenting a subtly mutating guitar harmony.  This song, like most of the LP's others, features discernable
    parts and complex evolutions, rather than just cascading instrumentation atop a stagnant rhythmic loop.</p><p>
<i>Bad Thriller</i>'s liner notes feature Abstrackt Keal Agram's name graffiti'd on a trucker hat, but
    their music is a novel reconciliation of old-school beatmaking and modern synth-pop in refulgent 32-bit
    color.  Although the album packs an overwhelming number of ideas into a scant 36 minutes-- and occasionally
    feels thematically and stylistically disjointed-- Abstrackt Keal Agram have vastly improved upon their prior
    outings.  And the fact that these songs were all written and recorded late last year-- immediately following
    the release of <i>Cluster Ville</i>-- means the improvements came quickly.  In my Pitchfork review of
    <i>Cluster Ville</i>, I tagged Abstrackt Keal Agram ""the hyperkinetic little brothers of the Gooom Disques
    roster.""  Here, their undying enthusiasm has served them well-- and every indication is that they'll only
    get better.</p></div>"|435.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/435-bad-thriller/|7.6|Sam Ubl

<p>Psych-folk warblers Vetiver (with Andy Cabic, Devendra Banhart, Alissa Anderson, and Jim Gaylord) have opted to cluster, hold hands, and skip the line between deviously surreal and lullingly pleasant, leading us all very, very deep into the forest, leaving no trail of breadcrumbs in sight. Vetiver could very well be the blurry soundtrack to a delirious fever dream: The band's self-titled debut is a dizzyingly euphoric tangle of freaked-out folk and scratchy strings, all twisted sheets and sweaty brows, upside-down trees and wicked flowers. Anchored by Cabic's tousled vocals and Banhart's amber guitar strums, Vetiver is swampy and sublime, a compelling mix of sweet, candlelit laments and jagged hymns.</p>
<p>A sizable clump of guest-players help out here-- Joanna Newsom tickles a harp (""Amerile""), Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval offers backing coos (""Angels' Share""), and former My Bloody Valentine drummer Colm O'Ciosoig putters stoically at his kit (""Luna Sea"", ""On a Nerve""). But it's Devendra Banhart who ultimately infuses Cabic's soft, fraying songs with wooly layers of warmth. Banhart's semi-infamous transcontinental loping (see substantial stints in Paris and Venezuela, and a handful of years logged as a roaming mistral, squatting, playing, and recording songs on a friend's answering machine) tend to pump his solo records full of whimsy, and unsurprisingly, Banhart's nomadic tendencies lend Vetiver the same kind of strange, rambling diversity.</p>
<p>""Amour Fou"", one of two songs Banhart co-wrote with Cabic, is so charmingly bizarre that listening feels a little bit like pedaling through the French countryside on a three-seat bicycle: precarious, exuberant, and inexcusably weird. Scratchy banjo, acoustic guitar, and a bit of bass tumble together girlishly, while Banhart and Cabic enthusiastically bellow, ""Love-love-love-love-crazy love/ Amour fou-ooooh!"" Curl your fingers around the handlebars and let the purple streamers fly: No matter how hard you try, Vetiver is too blissfully strange for your sofa alone.</p>
<p>Cabic's delicate voice (as previously heard in the Simple Machines band The Raymond Brake) can swing from salty to sweet within a single syllable, and is anchored here only by his gingerly picked guitar and yawning swells of violin-- like a gentler Tom Waits (or a throatier Donovan), Cabic is happy to marry the familiar and the strange, warbling quietly (and occasionally in romance languages) over plucky layers of instrumentation. ""Without a Song"" bashfully mixes high and low noisemaking, with impeccable cello and violin lines rubbing up against prehistoric foot-tapping-as-percussion, while opener ""Oh Papa"" swirls contentedly, strings and guitar finding easy communion.</p>
<p>Blame Thom Monahan's naked production, or the band's presumably ancient instruments, but something about Vetiver feels entirely anachronistic, impossibly devoid of 21st century stamps. Still, while Vetiver have successfully eschewed contemporary gloss in favor of following weird, primeval whims, their neo-psych musings are always tender and accessible, as quirky and warm as a well-worn Nick Drake tape. Somehow, all lyric abstractions and structural foibles seem perfectly reasonable in context, each ancient folksong gloriously comprehensible, despite incompatibility of time and place. Thus, when Cabic howls about ""the shape of things to come"" (on closing epic ""On a Nerve""), it somehow seems like far more than just a thinly veiled Ornette Coleman reference, or a vague prediction-- it sounds like a promise for the future.</p></div>"|8528.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8528-vetiver/|8.3|Amanda Petrusich

<p>Oh yeah, Simple Minds.  They're that <i>Breakfast Club</i> band, with the ""(Don't You) Forget About Me""     song, right?  Well, yes.  But years before that, they were just one more upstart band toiling in the     post-punk swamp of the late-70s UK, cutting tangled avant-dance records for the clubs in Orwell's Oceania.     And after years of letting them languish Stateside as U2 clones from the decade of hairspray and coke,     Virgin has now gone and given their early catalog the remaster/reissue treatment for a new, more danceable     decade.  What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>I'm not going to set any Simple Minds LP up as a masterpiece, because I'd be lying if I did, but they     nevertheless made a few excellent albums, and they're certainly worth a look and a listen for folks who     just can't get enough of that wonderful post-punk.  Although Virgin has reissued 12 Simple Minds albums--     nearly their entire oeuvre-- I've chosen to focus on two of their most wonderfully strange records, 1979's     <i>Reel to Real Cacophony</i> and 1980's <i>Empires and Dance</i>, the band's sophomore and junior albums,     respectively.  These two albums feature Simple Minds pulling themselves together musically and finding     their direction.  Here, the band is moving away from its disorganized debut, <i>Life in a Day</i> (to say     it was padded with filler is pretty charitable) and toward the expansive, reverb-soaked anthems that     characterized its greatest achievement, 1982's <i>New Gold Dream (81-82-83-84)</i>, and their eventual     string of U.S. hits.</p>
<p><i>Reel to Real</i> is the wildest ride the Simple Minds ever went on, foraying into soundscape weirdness     (check the bugged-out bass riff that lends contour to the ambient squiggle of ""Veldt""), as well as spiky     mirror-ball rock and gothic motorik.  Jim Kerr's vocals wouldn't yet attain their full Bonoesque bombast     for a few years-- here, he instead falls somewhere between Bryan Ferry and Colin Newman, at once spastic     and strangely reserved.  ""Reel to Real"" opens the album at a crawl, with the band banging out a cockeyed     rhythm and Kerr snaking through it wraithlike.  The album's peaks include the wickedly loopy ""Carnival     (Shelter in a Suitcase)"", which veers between <i>Can of Bees</i> psych verses and crazy circus synth parts     over percolating bass, and ""Changeling"", a bristling dance track led by a nasty, fuzzed-out synth.     ""Changeling"" pairs nicely with ""Premonition"", which-- with its insistent bass and Kerr's bombastic chorus--     is the album's best predicator of the band's future.</p>
<p>The approach is more refined on <i>Empires and Dance</i>, but at that time, Simple Minds still hadn't     completely reined in their experimental tendencies.  ""Twist/Run/Repulsion"" shows the band's Roxy Music     influence more clearly than any of their other songs.  Not only do Kerr's motormouth vocals sound like     Ferry, but the dissonant horn blasts, syncopated bassline, and recording of a female announcer speaking     French over an intercom kick it quite a bit further into leftfield than it initially seems willing to go.     The album is much slower than its predecessor, but is nevertheless dominated by a triumvirate of propulsive     songs that break up the medium pacing.  Opener ""I Travel"" whips along on machine-gun synth, bumping bass,     and big keyboards.  ""This Fear of Gods"" is a harrowing seven-minute epic of collapsing reverb and buoyant     rhythm.  The Teutonic synthesizer and choppy beat of ""Thirty Frames a Second"" make a strange mix, but work     nicely under Kerr's twitchy shouting.</p>
<p>Whether you should approach Simple Minds' earliest material depends on your appetite for the open-ended     aesthetics of the post-punk era.  The band's early albums nestle nicely next to Wire's <i>154</i>, The     Sound's <i>Propaganda</i>, Shriekback's <i>Care</i>, and Neu!'s <i>75</i>.  Each of these two Simple Minds     records has its share of inessential material, but that is greatly outweighed by the good stuff.  A     thoughtfully chosen highlight reel from the band's first six albums would really be an ideal introduction     but, as none exists, either of these albums would be a good doorway to an oft-neglected band.</p></div>"|11840.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11840-reel-to-real-cacophony-empires-and-dance/|8.5|Joe Tangari

    Andrew Weatherall and Keith Tenniswood are clearly well-versed, because for eight years, they've been generating
    solid remixes from even the most paltry of source material.  Fortunately, the dependable East London duo has
    also been invited to tinker with some well-oiled engines in their day. These sonic alchemists have reprogrammed
    a wealth of original music by everyone from Paul Weller to David Holmes-- pausing along the way to craft
    some of Warp Records' most consistently satisfying work.  If only for convenience's sake, the new remix
    collection <i>Peppered With Spastic Magic</i> is an essential selection, one that should please even the
    likes of unlikely collaborators Starsailor, who, right about now, should probably be looking to the abundance
    of TLS collectivists to balance their own fading sales.</p><p>
    
    The more likely TLS allies in Slam have a pretty good hold on effective dance floor mechanics, and Weatherall
    and Tenniswood capitalize on that expertise with a riotous yet faithful vocal mix of ""Visions"".  Although
    that track is a fairly recognizable regurgitation, it's nestled among an album's worth of wayward hijackings.
    Covering nearly a decade's worth of tracks, the album acts as a cross-section of TLS's history.  ""Put Your
    Arms Around Me (Electric for Bird Mix)"" consumes Texas in a constellation of delicate eeriness and techno
    deconstruction that was the hallmark of TLS's 2000 release <i>Tiny Reminders</i>.  Howie B's ""Angels Go Bald
    Too"" is fed through the same strange machinery that imbued 1998's <i>Stay Down</i> with quirky melancholia--
    as darkly alien as it is irrepressibly seductive.  Long time Weatherall favorites Lali Puna are given room
    to breathe within an intensely warm and reflective rendering of ""Nin-Com-Pop"", revealing a resilient
    tenderness scattered throughout its chilly beats.</p><p>
    
    It's a shame that only 13 tracks were selected to represent Two Lone Swordsmen's rich remix legacy--
    particularly when only half of them are of high quality.  For instance, a relatively weak and dated
    Stereo MCs rehash is included at the expense of any number of better works could have been chosen instead
    to rub shoulders with the elating electro treatment of Primal Scream's ""Stuka"".  Still, there is a staggeringly
    high level of quality that infests just about everything TLS touch.  Their sound is as synonymous with
    technical prowess as it is with instinctive innovation, and <i>Peppered with Spastic Magic</i> retains a
    contemporaneous air despite its timeline, one which is an eon in terms of modern electronic music.  And
    if TLS's imminent <i>From the Double Gone Chapel</i> is as mold-breaking and transitional as it's rumored
    to be, <i>Peppered</i> will be a worthy summary of Messrs.  Weatherall and Tenniswood Mk. I, the moment
    before they turn their revisionist talents to rewriting their own legacy.</p></div>"|8226.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8226-peppered-with-spastic-magic/|7.0|Dan Lett

<i>Poltergeist</i>s and <i>Licensed to Ill</i>: Some things only make sense to kids.  Too many years removed
    from junior high, they tend only to reveal themselves in annoying bursts of violence, confusion and rhymes
    like Abe Vigoda.  And it's not even because their appeal is particularly juvenile, but rather that they
    operate in a realm only comprehensible to the innocent; those untouched by the brutal reality of the real
    world, where everyday injustice skews our perception to the point that what might have been common sense to
    us as adolescents now seems mystifying.  To little Carol Anne, Ad-Rock simply <i>is</i> another child.</p><p>
    
    New York brats-cum-activists Beastie Boys have gone to great pains to explain the error of their 80s ways.
    This is not to say they've been apologetic, but only too keen to emphasize the arcs of their characters
    over the years.  <i>Licensed to Ill</i>, like <i>Cooky Puss</i> and the underrated <i>Rock Hard</i> EP
    before it, were indeed both impressively ahead of their time, and rudimentary to the extreme.  How a city
    that already had ESG felt it needed the Beastie Boys in the mid-80s is a question that confounds the ages;
    yet, Ad-Rock, MCA and Mike D could hardly have predicted the slacker generation better if they'd tried
    (which they didn't).  Chalk it up to NYC eclecticism, perhaps.  Chalk it up to Run-DMC and Madonna, who
    helped showcase them to the most economically and culturally powerful generation of kids since the boomers.
    Chalk it up to Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin.  And MTV.  Most of all, remember that at their worst, these
    guys got thrown out of White Castle for being too loud.</p><p>
<i>Licensed to Ill</i> is given a lot of credit for predating the whole rap-rock thing of the 90s.  Bad
    news for the Beasties: History appears to contradict that assessment.  First of all, their cornball Cali
    cousins the Red Hot Chili Peppers had already graced the earth with two LPs prior to <i>Ill</i>, not to
    mention beating them to the 70s funk revival by working with George Clinton.  Secondly, contrary to most
    rock writers' beliefs, white guys + guitars do not necessarily = rock.  Had they released <i>Ill</i> even
    four years later, it would have been a novelty record.  It's dated remarkably badly, while Rick Rubin's
    skill with the mixer (and drum machine) is entirely questionable.  The rhymes... well...</p><p>
<i>""I got franks and pork and beans/ Always bust the new routines.""</i></p><p>
    
    ""Spent some bank, I got a high powered jumbo/ Rolled up a wooly and I watched Colombo.""</p><p>
    
    ""I keep a pistol in my pocket so you better be cautious/ Fly around the world but it makes me nauseous.""</p><p>
    
    ""Get ready/ 'Cause this ain't funny/ My name's Mike D and I'm about to get money.""</p><p>
    
    Okay, so it isn't the music or all the rhymes that translate beyond the scene of the crime.  What, then?
    Probably just that the Beasties didn't give a fuck-- AND AMERICA DESPERATELY NEEDED TO BE SHOWN HOW NOT
    TO GIVE A FUCK.  And it sort of still does.  <i>Licensed to Ill</i> demonstrated that you could be
    ""groundbreaking"" and ""important,"" and still have no goals beyond getting drunk before 6th period.  Think
    about that.  It meant that you could live life as one giant inside joke, speaking in tongues and making
    hilarious references to Chef Boyardee with no one outside your circle of jerks the wiser.  Sorry ma,
    forgot to take out the trash, but that's okay because I drink Brass Monkey and I rock well.  ""What?""
    ""Nothing.""</p><p>
    
    In light of this information, it almost seems pointless to recap the highlights.  Does anyone really care
    that ""Rhymin' and Stealin"""" witnessed Rubin's genius for exposing the sample-ability of Led Zeppelin?  No,
    because, ""My pistol is loaded, I shot Betty Crocker/ Deliver Colonel Sanders down to Davey Jones' locker""
    is awesome, and if you don't get it then what-the-fuck-ever.  Does it matter that ""Fight for Your Right""
    actually does kind of invent rap-rock?  No, because everyone has their best porno mag, and these guys are
    just telling it like it is, and rap is the CNN of rock.  Do you know what ""I did it with my whiffleball bat""
    means?  Has anyone ever even been to Brooklyn?  Who in their right mind is sampling Creedence?  Is ""I should
    have probably guessed her gay"" the best line ever, or is it when they brag about having more rhymes than
    Phyllis Diller?</p><p>
    
    Despite its seeming defiance of respectable society, there is no shortage of folks who would canonize
    <i>Licensed to Ill</i>-- hence this new edition, replete with commemorative DVD.  For Miller's sake, it's
    the Beastie Boys' worst record.  (Even though we all secretly know it's their best.)  Yet, there's something
    impressive about tapping into the secret language of the immature and terminally slack.  All these years
    later, with every listen, it becomes clearer to me that you can never really outrun your inner idiot.</p></div>"|607.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/607-licensed-to-ill/|7.8|Dominique Leone

    <i>Rewind Vol. 3</i>?  Here's the scoop: Bing Ji Ling is a guy's name.  Bing Ji Ling also translates to
    ""ice cream"" in Mandarin.  Bing Ji, the man, wants you to believe ice cream is an aphrodisiac.  Bing Ji, the
    band, appears in concert with the dudes from No Doubt-- drummer Adrian Young and guitarist Tom Dumont--
    dressed in 1950s Good Humor Man outfits.  Bing Ji Ling also employs former pro skater Tommy Guerrero on
    bass, but on his debut album, <i>Doodle Loot Doodle a Doo</i>, he plays just about every instrument by
    himself; crisp, Cool Whip production is provided by the very interrogative Merkley???.  Bing Ji Ling is
    actually S.F. white boy/soul man/sundae fanatic Quinn Luke, and Bing is funkier than Fudgie the Whale
    with a blunt in his blowhole.  If Sly was a one-man family or if Beck and Prince took a double dip, it
    would taste something like this.</p><p>
    
    All good humor aside, Luke and Merkley??? clearly understand that the fundamentals of funk come down to
    hooks, texture and innuendo, and there are good 'n"" plenty of all three here.  The album starts off with
    the filtered wah-wah guitar and Casiotone percussion of ""Do What I Gotta Do"".  A party-starting screamer,
    the song climaxes with a looped one-man choir delivering quivering background vocals alongside swaggering
    horn splashes that erupt in an orgiastic P-Funky eargasm.  The song sets the bar damn high in terms of
    production quality and giddy, goony charm, and though there's diversity throughout the rest of the album's
    46 minutes, the cookie never crumbles.</p><p>
    
    ""Put Your Hand in Mine' is a midtempo organ grind as Luke wails like his Rhodes, ""I've been through some
    sticky clover/ But now my picking is over.""  The robotic handclaps on ""Can't Say Much"" crack over the
    layered, pitch-shifted vocals, while ""So Natural"" brings Steely Dan together with Prince in a cokeheads
    'n' cream wet dream.  Weighing in at the halfway mark is the anthemic ""Money in the Meter"".  Up to this
    point, lyrically speaking, there's a common theme of go-for-broke, wet-sheets sexual abandon, and ""Meter""
    follows suit.  No Doubt's Young makes his only album appearance here, keeping a real time beat snapping
    under a rubbery guitar lick and the chant-worthy chorus.  It's easy to imagine this song killing it live,
    as it offers not only the repeated lyrics (""Put your money in the meter/ Stay for a while"") but a scathingly
    sexy, shimmering melodic swing.  After these six minutes of unfettered flirtatiousness there's no way you
    won't go back to <i>Doodle Loot</i> for at least a second lick.</p><p>
    
    From the rambunctious ""Meter"", the album smoothes into denouement with a blissful post-coital melt.  Despite
    the focus on sugary melody, these last five songs are about unanswered booty calls; somehow, after all his
    carousing, Luke (or rather, alter-ego Bing Ji Ling) hits a rocky road with the ladies and can't find the
    right flavor.  ""Where Is Your Love"" is a bittersweet psychedelic soul ballad buttered by ambient synths
    and lush vocals, and the almost-acoustic ""You"" is a doo-wop lament of lost love and failed reconciliation
    skipping along over a chunky funk-hop rhythm.  It all comes to a surprisingly tender finale with ""Time to
    Breathe"", as Luke/Ling woos, ""Time to breathe has taught me/ I can never get enough of your love.""</p><p>
    
    When the music comes to a swooning stop, check out the ridiculously clever CD packaging: the inside features
    five separate makeout scenes-- a pint of empty ""Bing Ji Ling Ice Cream"" in the foreground of each-- while the
    outside is a five-panel spread of a long-locked, custom-airbrush-suited Luke doing the disco at his favorite
    scoop shop.  Mixing Ben &amp; Jerry's instrumental density with snow-cone sweet lyrics, <i>Doodle Loot</i>
    balances the chocolate with the vanilla and makes for one delicious swirl.</p></div>"|1106.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1106-doodle-loot-doodle-a-doo/|7.6|Jonathan Zwickel

    in experimental electronic music in recent years""-- as he recently did in his review of Fennesz's exceptional
    <i>Venice</i>-- I'm inclined to trust his judgment.  What's always reluctantly been called IDM <i>does</i>
    seem less compelling by the day, victimized by both process music that makes for a better backstory than
    listening experience and a roughly three-year flood of experimental electronic refuges seeking shelter in
    the more rewarding and head-turning world of tech-house.</p><p>
    
    The rise of tech-house-- and its annexation of the best work of former <i>Clicks &amp; Cuts</i>-style producers
    such as Vladislav Delay, Hakan Libdo, Reinhard Voigt, and Jan Jelinek-- may seem like a very large nail in
    IDM's potential pine box, but it also pointed a way forward for electronic head music.  The message: Shave
    your beard.  Loosen up.  Have fun.  Since then, several artists have pulled off the trick by re-engaging
    with clubland, making music that-- while compelling in any environment-- often works best in a dancefloor
    context.</p><p>
    
    Jason Forrest doesn't make dance music, but unlike most IDM producers he doesn't shy away from the vitality
    and immediacy of it, either.  Forrest is still probably best known as Donna Summer, former host of WFMU's
    ""Advanced D&amp;D;"" radio program and leader of the impish breakcore collective Cock Rock Disco.  That tag is
    essentially what <i>The Unrelenting Songs of the 1979 Post Disco Crash</i> sounds like: brash and big,
    furious and frantic, and best enjoyed loud.  And it's performed with a sly wink and nods to everyone from
    Prefuse 73 to dj/Rupture, while drawing samples from sources as diverse as Talking Heads, Elton John,
    Creedence Clearwater Revival, and The Who.</p><p>
    
    Forrest isn't much for minimalism.  Perhaps a lesson learned from his WFMU days, he offers his listeners
    instant gratification-- which is a good thing, as these days, our fingers twitch just as impatiently over
    the iPod dial as they do the radio tuner.  So, like The Avalanches' <i>Since I Left You</i> or Basement
    Jaxx's <i>Kish Kash</i>, this is a maximalist record.  Sounds and ideas come quickly, make their points,
    and never outstay their welcome.  In that sense, <i>The Unrelenting Songs of the 1979 Post Disco Crash</i>
    is also inclusive, a post-mashup dragnet that sweeps metal, drill-n-bass, gabba, disco, and familiar FM
    rock staples into a single pie and then slices it with precision.</p><p>
    
    For about 40 seconds, album opener ""Spectacle to Refute All Judgments"" seems like another example of
    music-making that struggles to make the leap from idea to execution, as Forrest applies to disco the
    slice-and-dice aesthetic that Scott Herren has used on hip-hop.  Then comes the first guitar solo.  And
    the big glam stomp.  And the second guitar solo.  And the drum solo.  And... well, it quickly becomes clear
    that Forrest has a lot of cards up his sleeve, and little interest in holding any of them close to his chest
    for any length of time.  Which works beautifully: ""Satan Cries Again"" tears through CCR's jungle, pausing
    only for a motorik pep rally; ""An Event (helicopter.passing.(edit).251001.mp3)"" is solemn and hypnotic from
    a distance before being swept up in the winds of a clusterfuck of organ sounds; and ""180 Mar Ton"" sounds
    like the Amen break crossing the river Styx.</p><p>
    
    The liberal sampling of classic rock on what is at heart a disco-cum-noise record shouldn't be much of a
    hurdle for potential fans to jump: The arena-ready guitars serve the same sort of capacity as breakbeats
    do in Big Beat records-- as patient, friendly guides for those who don't normally listen to electronic
    music-- while the sensual futurism of ""Ceci N'est Pas du Disco"" or deep house tribalism of ""INKhUK"" is
    far too infectious to be ignored, even by the biggest guitar-phobics.</p><p>
    
    Forrest does, however, have The Who to thank for his show-stopping album closer, ""10 Amazing Years"".  The
    record's most ferocious and <i>Unrelenting</i> track, it's also oddly the most patient and straightforward,
    eschewing most of the ADD tendencies of the rest of the album.  Except for a heavily reprogrammed Ringo
    Starr drum solo and an extra kick of guitar at the end, it's essentially filter disco meets classic rock.
    It's The Who in their prime covering ""Da Funk"", with a half-dozen or so bare and, yes, fairly minimal
    elements drifting in and out of the track at different times before they all come crashing together for
    one glorious finale.  Were it at the start of the record, it would cast a long shadow over the rest of
    it.  As it is, it just makes you want to dive in and hear the whole thing over again.</p></div>"|3290.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3290-the-unrelenting-songs-of-the-1979-post-disco-crash/|8.5|Scott Plagenhoef

No problem, right?  You scrape some cash together and     hit the beat.  Make a few phone calls, get some comparative hourly rates, and determine which you can most     afford.  Maybe you've even got a label willing to pay for all that studio time.  Even simpler, then.  But.     Say your country is still recovering from a brutal ethno-religious conflict that decimated its neighboring     country and ravaged much of the countryside.  You're an unsigned surf band in the middle of Eastern Europe--     Croatia, to be exact-- and you want to cut a record.  Not so easy now.</p>
<p>This is the daunting situation that faced The Bambi Molesters, the Balkans' finest purveyors of good,     old-fashioned surf-rock, when they set out in the late 90s to put to tape some of their ultra-reverent,     unironic paeans to The Ventures, Duane Eddy, and Dick Dale.  When they finally loaned some space from an     acquaintance, they had precious little time to record the album, and as a result, they wound up blasting     it out in a span of just a few hours, one take per song.  The sound was muddy, the cymbals bled into every     microphone, and the label owner they finally got to distribute it-- Igor Banjanin of Dirty     Old Town Records-- had to hit up loan sharks to get it distributed.</p>
<p>That was seven years ago.  In the interim, the Molesters have cultivated ties to R.E.M. and The Minus 5     (they toured together in Europe), managed to get an album out in the U.S. (2002's fantastic <i>Sonic Bullets</i>,     on which both Peter Buck and Scott McCaughey guested), and watched as Croatia stabilized and put its war     behind it.  As the generous liners to this re-recording of that shaky start attest, they were never happy     with the sound of their debut.  So, with their newfound stability, they decided to try it again, and even     threw in a few extra songs to boot.</p>
<p>The material they were writing out of the gate demonstrates a remarkably deep understanding of what made     original surf music work so well, from the Spanish and Greek influences in the melodies to the snapping     spring reverb that enveloped the guitars of Dick Dale and Link Wray.  This stuff sounds so real, so honest,     it could only have been made by people unaware of its relative kitsch value in the U.S.  Modern American     surf bands like Man... or Astroman?, The Aquabats and The Surfers operate fully aware of <i>Beach Blanket     Bingo</i> and Quentin Tarantino's employment of ""Misirlou"" in <i>Pulp Fiction</i>, and it inevitably colors     the way they approach the music; Man... or Astroman?, in particular, compound the kitsch factor by pouring     on samples of Japanese monster movies and old drag-race flicks.</p>
<p>Though a few of these songs fail to fully demonstrate the compositional brilliance that characterized     <i>Sonic Bullets</i>, most of these early Molesters tunes can hang ten with anything just below ""Rabble     Rouser"" and ""Walk Don't Run"" in the surf pantheon, with the one-two punch of ""Wanganui"" and ""Hot Water Pool"",     opening things with a wave of huge, twangy melody and tremolo'd chords.  ""Hot Water Pool"" now has the added     benefit of a rock-solid horn arrangement, which punches the energy level up even further.  The sound this     time out is clear and cavernous, as it should be, and band sounds utterly confident with the material.  One     of the remarkable things about The Bambi Molesters is how much of their own original material they play,     as a lot of surf bands lean heavily on standards for a lot of their material.  However, a few old chestnuts--     like The Surftones' ""Cecilia Ann"" (best known today as the lead track on the Pixies' <i>Bossa Nova</i>) and     ""Margaya""-- do crop up, each attacked with enthusiastic passion.</p>
<p><i>Dumb Loud Hollow Twang</i> isn't the best place to meet The Bambi Molesters; with its more advanced     compositions and perfect sound, <i>Sonic Bullets</i> is really the best of both worlds.  Still, it's nice     that it's been made available in the States, and anyone into surf will definitely want to check it out.     It's always refreshing to hear a solid, untainted take on a well-worn American genre.</p></div>"|539.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/539-dumb-loud-hollow-twang-deluxe-edition/|7.2|Joe Tangari

    pick me up, but you know what I'm say--</p><p>
    
    El-P: Shut the fuck up, Urkel!  Man, who invited you?  I think Camu might be onto something.  Elaborate,
    nigga.</p><p>
    
    Camu Tao: Word.  Basically, you could make a few beats that all sound pretty similar and are all technically
    tight, except whenever we would normally show a dope beat respect, we could just dumb down the whole process!
    Like, maybe you could make this dirty, guttural synth bounce track with some cowbell in it and we could act
    out a story about crashing the VMAs and you being too messed up on mushrooms to accurately shoot Sheryl Crow!</p><p>
    
    El-P: It's a plan-- but only if I can reference Salvador Dali.  I have to appear intelligent while limiting
    my vocabulary at the same time.</p><p>
    
    Camu Tao: Deal.</p><p>
    
    Aesop Rock: I am inclined to agree, amicable individuals.  Most of the [unintelligible] consumer base that
    purchased or electronically procured <i>Bazooka Tooth</i>, my magnum opus, were taken aback by my
    [unintelligible] production backdrops.  Ergo, I must regress my musical acumen and output to aurally
    mirror that of my earlier albums.  Clearly, our fans consider us so far ahead of our time that if we were
    all to similarly regress, we'd be allowing the opposition a chance to see us and understand our message!</p><p>
    
    Mr. Lif: I hate to be a Negative Nelly, but shouldn't we keep trying to top our previous work, instead of
    just making the same sounds and retreading older developments?</p><p>
    
    El-P: Listen, Whoopi, maybe if you'd pipe the fuck down, I could make some calls and see if Ted Danson will
    have sex with you again.</p><p>
<i>[everyone laughs, sings </i>Cheers<i> theme]</i></p><p>
    
    Camu Tao: Yeah, so, anyway, we could bring in some of those newer guys and make sure they follow the new
    Def Jux song template: The beats can be solid, but they have to be so monotonous and regressive that it
    makes the lame verses of the label's core artists appear better than they actually are.</p><p>
    
    Carnage <i>[popping out of a closet]</i>: Yeah, and I could rap about rapping, over a beat that samples me
    saying, ""Make news,"" over and over!  It just might be irritating enough to work!</p><p>
    
    El-P <i>[to Carnage]</i>: I have no idea who you are, but that's never stopped me before.  Right, 4th Pyramid?</p><p>
    
    4th Pyramid <i>[to El-P]</i>: Word, God.  My plan is to do this ridiculously pretentious one where the
    chorus is, ""Master of my own fate, it's my career,"" and the song itself is an obnoxious, over-rhyming brag
    track with a bong sample.  No one could <i>ever</i> like that!  Like, seriously, I'll be all, ""Rap attack
    you, grab and smack you/ MOVE WITH THE FLASH DUDE, never act rude/ Past dues, harpoons come back at you!""

    Camu Tao: Hey! We could do a song about this! Except you could be the OxyContin dealer fucking someone
    else's girlfriend, Cage could be an angry lover, and you could have a conflict that has no actual ending!
    Oh, and instead of making a beat, you could just use the same sample as Slug's ""Body Pillow"" for added
    irony.  And when is that girl gonna suck me off?</p><p>
    
    El-P: She's slow, but her work is surprisingly technical-- SORTA LIKE VAST THREE YEARS AGO, ahahahahhahaha...</p><p>
    
    Vast Aire: Fuck you!  I ain't fallen off yet!  I'm just trying to focus on me right now, and if you can't
    understand that, then I guess you aren't really my friends!</p><p>
    
    El-P: Uh, Camu, how will we get this memo to Rjd2 and Murs?  They're in the studio right now!  They're
    liable to make some dope shit and fuck everything up!</p><p>
    
    Camu Tao: Don't worry, champ.  We need to have a couple good songs to make it seem a little less suspicious.
    And besides, everyone will skip Murs' song because no one will admit to liking him.</p><p>
    
    El-P: On the real, yo, I think this could work out fine. I mean, maybe if we try to become more and more
    commercial in our mindset, we could get on <i>TRL</i>!  Come on, dog, you know how I do!  I LIKES MY PUSSY

At least not lately.  Back in the early 1990s, she was an
    alt-pin-up girl with a throwback hairstyle, breathy voice, and smart, stripped-down songs-- mostly other
    people's, but who really cared?  She released a few seven-inch singles and two EPs (one of which contained
    the fabulous fanboy rebuke ""His Indie World"") before finally signing with then-Sony subsidiary The Work Group.
    On a cold day in January 1998, she released <i>Got No Shadow</i>, a charming collection of covers (Freedy
    Johnston, Elizabeth Cotton) and impressive originals (""Western Union Desperate"").  And then she promptly
    disappeared, rumored to be battling a drug addiction, with only a live album and a split single with Sean
    Na Na to hold fans over.</p><p>
    
    Six years later, <i>Got No Shadow</i> still charms, but Lord has lost most, if not all, of her indie relevance,
    despite returning to an indie label-- pal Nick Salmon's Rubric Records-- for her new album, <i>Baby Blue</i>.
    The move away from the majors coincides with a shift from the precise, pristine pop of <i>Got No Shadow</i>
    to a looser, janglier sound that, unfortunately, recalls early Shawn Colvin.  For a singer who idolizes ""my
    Joni, my Nick, Neil, and Bob,"" this is not an unexpected move, but neither is it a successful one.</p><p>
    
    As on all of her previous releases, Lord believed above all else in the power of the well-written song, in
    its commanding ability to convey intimate emotions and complex ideas equally well.  But her stalwart devotion
    proves both a strength and a liability on <i>Baby Blue</i>.  For one thing, she has strong material that
    makes for memorable tracks like ""43"", in which she questions her relationship with either a young lover or
    her young fans: ""Seventeen/ Wonder what you see in me/ I'm going on 43.""  Tracks like ""The Wind Blew All
    Around Me"" and ""Farming It Out"" reveal Lord's insecurities, mostly about her career, with surprising candor,
    while ""Ron"" is a tearjerker about a single mother waiting for her daughter's father to return.</p><p>
    
    But too often, Lord's approach to her lyrics is overly reverent, to the detriment of the music itself.
    Especially in the album's midsection, her backing band churns out country-rock rhythms so bland they seem
    designed specifically not to distract from the words.  But it's not always the best package for the lyrics--
    the effect is much like wrapping sparkling jewelry in dull newsprint.  On songs like ""Because He's Leaving""
    and ""The Inhibition Twist"", the music either sounds completely disconnected from her vocals or completely
    drowns them out. ""Stars Burn Out"" slows down until it almost stops completely, and Lord's cover of Pink
    Floyd's ""Fearless"" is a showcase more for the reined-in band than for her vocals, resulting in an
    attention-straining five-minute anticlimax.</p><p>
    
    Fortunately, <i>Baby Blue</i> ends not with ""Fearless"", but with ""Old Tin Tray"", a modest little jingle
    reminiscent of <i>Got No Shadow</i>'s ""Shake Sugaree"".  In its simplicity and unpretentious directness it
    recalls Lord's early work, which is appropriate: <i>Baby Blue</i> sounds like the work of a much younger,
    less confident artist-- one who's closer to 17 than 43.  More than a decade into her unpredictable career,
    Lord seems like she's still grasping for a comfortable mix of guitar and vocals, not quite sure what works
    best with her unique voice.</p></div>"|4857.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4857-baby-blue/|5.7|Stephen M. Deusner

    <i>Summer Make Good</i>: What could you possibly have said nice about the vocals here?  How many times did
    you want to just say to this band, ""I'm sorry, I can't do this,"" hang up your press kit-writing jeff cap,
    and just spend the rest of your life banging your face against a sheet of nails?</p><p>
    Let me explain.  For starters, <i>Summer Make Good</i> departs further from the group's 2000 debut,
    <i>Yesterday Was Dramatic, Today Is OK</i> and settles almost entirely on instrument- and song-based
    compositions.  Change is good, and I can dig a group experimenting with its sound and redefining its goals
    and so on, but let me be perfectly clear about Múm's song-aspiring arch: It's a fucking terrible idea, and
    they should stop it immediately.</p><p>
    In his review of 2002's <i>Finally We Are No One</i>, Mark Richardson remarked quite accurately that ""Múm
    is not bestowed with the gift of melody""-- as it turns out, they aren't terribly great instrumentalists,
    either.  The songs on <i>Summer Make Good</i> are similarly flimsy, low on ideas, and, as lo-fi compositions,
    terribly unambitious.  The clear loser of this outing, however, is singer Kristín Anna Valt\xFDsdótti, whose
    grating, Fran Drescher-as-a-seven-year-old vocals rival the unspeakably awful, kitschy croons of fellow
    Scandinavian Anton Maiden.</p><p>
    It's not that Múm have broken a barrier to make their first entirely unpleasant record-- the addition of
    drums and trumpet do make for some compelling instrumental moments-- but there simply aren't enough exciting
    or even vaguely interesting moments in each song, and between this scarcity and, Jesus, <i>that voice</i>,
    <i>Summer Make Good</i> seems an unfortunate addition to 2004's disappointments.</p><p>
    It's frustrating how little there is to say about these songs.  ""Weeping Rock, Rock"", ""The Ghosts You Draw
    On My Back"", ""Sing Me Out the Window"", ""Oh, How the Boat Drifts"", and ""Will the Summer Make Good for All
    of Our Sins"" are of an obnoxiously homogenous ""dark"" and ""brooding"" sentiment; the songs ride roughly the
    same tempos and formulas, where stripped-down acoustic ambience leads unalarmingly into a tepid chorus,
    then usually trails off into more electronic terrain, as if in a nod to the band's <i>Yesterday Was Dramatic</i>
    past.</p><p>
    If Múm plans to stick with this sound, then ""The Island of Children's Children"" and ""Nightly Cares"" seem
    probably the best direction in which they could continue-- the two songs definite highlights of <i>Summer
    Make Good</i>.  Formally, the songs benefit from much more careful consideration than was given to the
    album's other tracks, both covering considerable melodic ground while also bearing witness to the band's

    self-taught drummer/loop digger.  But in the case of the official release of the Madlib-helmed Yesterday's
    New Quintet's fabled <i>Stevie: An Instrumental Tribute to Stevie Wonder</i>, no such trepidation is
    necessary.</p><p>
    
    The <i>Stevie</i> story goes: Madlib forms fictitious group, recreates classic sounds, deems it unsuitable
    for release, tosses it in as a promo to love-starved journalists.  Journalists get addicted and play it at
    parties, record gets heavily bootlegged, Madlib rethinks decision, re-sequences and remasters record,
    adds a song, and puts it up for sale.  But are the additions and alterations worth the price of admission?
    Undeniably, yes.</p><p>
    
    The remastered cuts pop louder and with more presence than the ones on the promo, but some of the mixing
    could have better emphasized certain elements-- particularly in the case of the keyboards, which are too
    deep in the mix.  In a few cases, I also would've preferred louder drum work from Madlib.  This is not to
    say that the sound is disappointing.  On this record-- which blends the live explosiveness of jazz with
    hip-hop's spirit of inventiveness-- the music works as both background ambience and the forefront of any
    party.</p><p>
    
    Madlib selected a relatively upbeat group of Wonder tracks, and focuses more on a constant low end and
    meandering grooves rather than the sound collages more associated with his hip-hop production.  From the
    throbbing Cuban bounce and addictive synth keys of ""Visions"" to the understated bass groove and swift
    snare hits of ""Rocket Love Pt. 1"", Yesterday's New Quintet reconstructs tracks from several periods of
    Wonder's career without losing continuity or wandering beyond a song's parameters.  I definitely would've
    enjoyed Madlib's take on some of my personal favorites (""Living for the City"", ""Big Brother', ""I Was Made
    to Love Her"") but this is clearly a project with an agenda, however loose it may seem.</p><p>
    
    And yes, the new song (""This Girl"") is good.  It has a rugged bass loop and clapping snare that's falls
    closer to Jay Dee than Quincy Jones, while its light synth flourishes pleasantly accompany the ever-present
    keys on a sequence that's both guttural in tone and displays mesmerizing technique.</p><p>
    
    Still, the record isn't bulletproof: The song choice could've been more varied across Wonder's catalog,
    the instruments emphasized in its mix could've been selected a little more appropriately, and the album
    could stand to be a little longer.  But all things considered, <i>Stevie</i> not only reinforces YNQ's
    commercial clout within the independent music scene, but it's also another strong 2004 release from the
    Stones Throw camp.</p></div>"|4178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4178-stevie/|8.5|Rollie Pemberton

    computer to bed with him, and finding pleasure in the way it warmed his sheets.  I suppose it's taking
    the idea of the bedroom musician to its logical conclusion.  I realize that there's too much of this
    music floating around for some people, but I like the idea of light, quiet indie pop made with computers.
    It seems such a natural fit.</p><p>
    Berlin's Kat Cosm is a boy/girl duo (Sebastian Skalei and Jana Plewa) that combines guitar, piano, and yes,
    computer processing, and <i>Knightboat</i> is their second record, a long EP with three remixes of the
    title track added.  The opening title track immediately presents Kat Cosm's modus operandi, with out-of-tune
    electric guitar providing texture against acoustic strumming, bits of Rhodes keyboard, and crunchy
    Cornelius-style drum programming.  Enormously inviting as it builds over its six minutes, the song winds
    from a lengthy intro through Skalei's hushed verses, until it finishes with a big, heartswollen chorus
    which finds Plewa chiming, ""We can't go on like this.""  It's a nakedly romantic, corny, whitebread thrill--
    which is exactly what this sort of music is supposed to be.</p><p>
    ""My Letter of Fate I Write for You Tonight"" is Plewa's showcase, opening with just her voice and piano,
    and then folding in bits of melodica and electronic keyboards.  She carries the tune well, recalling old
    folkie Rickie Lee Jones, but ultimately, the piece is a bit too short, and as a result seems simply like a
    sketch of what could have become a standout track.  The instrumental ""Hotgirl"" is pleasant enough, relying
    mainly on acoustic guitar, but would better serve as an interlude on a longer album than as a fully
    realized EP cut.  ""Circle/A Little Wetsan"", meanwhile, is a damn good tune, finding Skalei at the piano,
    crooning like Bacharach as slide guitar and some odd noises flit about the background.</p><p>
    The three remixes of ""Knightboat"" show the song to be remarkably pliable.  Planet \xB5's Leafcutter John finds
    the light and airy core at the song's center, adding fluttering percussion and successfully looping a
    particularly appealing melodic nugget.  TenEcke plays up the melancholy, foregrounding the chorus and
    draining the tune's rhythmic bed before adding a perfect blast of overdriven guitar.  The closing mix by
    Mondomarc is all about beats and remains connected to the original only subliminally.  ""Knightboat"" really
    is a fantastic pop song, and it sounds good pulled apart and reassembled into these configurations, but
    the rest of the EP is a tad patchy.  Somehow, though, in spite of virtually being a maxi-single with three
    B-sides, <i>Knightboat</i> makes for a decent listen straight through.  Kat Cosm: from their bedroom to
    yours.</p></div>"|4575.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4575-knightboat-ep/|6.4|Mark Richardson

    impassioned whisper; the soft hum of ringing strings as they pause for breath.  Too many musicians shy
    away from these voids.  Scared that each empty moment will expose their songs as half-formed, half-felt
    mock-ups of emotion, they fill each space with needless guitar lines, cloying strings, or overcooked vocal
    cadences.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps the reason <i>Homesongs</i> revels in such silences-- with its slowly shifting dynamics and effortless
    drops from towering intensity to breath-baiting sighs-- lies in its conception.  Written and recorded in the
    ex-Fridge guitarist's London home, Adem Ilhan's debut consists of songs culled from quiet evenings of
    epiphany and contemplation and of simple chords plucked in a bedroom and embroidered with the barest of
    adornments.</p><p>
    
    From the first hesitant strums of autoharp on ""Pillow"" to the pleading proposition, ""Could this be my home
    for tonight?"", the more sparse, lethargic moments on <i>Homesongs</i> sound as though Ilhan sat alone,
    puncturing the stillness of his surroundings, each of his notes a tiny tremor.  On ""Long Drive Home"", the
    worn acoustics that accompany Adem's cracked, lived-in voice are furnished with descending glockenspiel and
    modest organ parts, serving to accent his swollen-throated tale of a trampled-on lover.</p><p>
    
    But <i>Homesongs</i> is not simply a procession of trembling troubadour tunes.  For each turn of boxwood
    fragility, there's also one of bold and confident songwriting.  While many of the melodies on the album
    are too abstracted to pigeonhole Adem as alt-folk, the lilting grace, rolling acoustics, and undertow of
    wheezing harmonium on the wonderful ""Everything You Need"" sits comfortably alongside the low-rent Scottish
    folk propelled by the likes of Domino labelmates James Yorkston and ex-Beta Band member Lone Pigeon.
    Similarly, the sprawling six-minute strum ""These Are Your Friends"" gradually abandons its wistful narrative
    and gentle arrangements, building a fevered intensity around the mantra, ""Everybody needs some help sometimes,""
    before Adem cuts the chord, allowing his voice and a gentle wind to fade into the ether.</p><p>
    
    Though the album's home recording and quaint assembly of second-hand accompaniment may suggest a kitsch,
    lo-fi aspect, the reality is very different: These songs are well-produced.  Although Adem does not approach
    the instrumentation with the same disregard for convention you would expect from a member of a post-rock
    outfit like Fridge, the album's narrow array of sounds rarely restricts the effectiveness of its songs.
    Take ""One in a Million"": Adem sets the steel twang of banjo and guitar against a soft carpet of harmonium
    and a melody that flutters from half-spoken to impassioned falsetto, creating something both beautiful and
    understated.</p><p>
    
    Gentle yet never whimsical, intimate yet never insular, Adem's debut captures the often-unrealized potential
    of bedroom recording.  Avoiding crass emotioneering, it plays as a collection of late-night soliloquies.
    These are outward-looking songs of hope and hurt, wrapped in the warmth and familiarity that can only be
    replicated in the place one calls home.</p></div>"|4171.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4171-homesongs/|8.3|Neil Robertson

The parvenu French label's brand of electronic music is sleek,
    stylish, and occasionally flashy, but never tawdry.  Its artists are young and highly accessible, and their
    music eschews radicalism and experimentation in favor of a more direct, melodic approach.  The result is
    musically fashionable as only the French could make it: complex, and yet somehow pedestrian.  Take, for
    instance, the artwork on the label's new sampler, <i>Gooom Tracks, Vol. 2</i>: All white text on black
    background, sans-serif font embellished by strokes of sparse graffiti.  It's strikingly sophisticated,
    yet may well have been slapped together in MS Paint-- perfect for this album of bedroom symphonies from
    enthusiastic tweens.</p><p>
<i>Gooom Tracks, Vol. 2</i> features remixes of original works by 16 artists spanning the entire Gooom
    roster.  The theme yields generally interesting and occasionally breathtaking results, albeit working
    within a far less stringent set of guidelines than many undie electronic mixtapes.  <i>Gooom Tracks</i>
    is more of a sampler squared, purposely packed to the hilt with as many artists as possible.  Of course,
    while it's certainly a colorful and unbridled showcase of over two dozens talents, the format may not be
    the best or most germane representation of the Gooom roster.  But many of these tracks do show prodigious
    ability and a fluent chemistry that's rare among so large a label.</p><p>
    Kicking things off is an acoustic version of Cyann &amp; Ben's ""Buick to the Moon"", a somber, slightly soporific
    number that shows the group's folk-tinged electronic songwriting at its most elemental.  Backed by mournful
    organs moving at a funereal pace, the Buick might as well be a hearse, but the song is short enough not to
    stifle the album's energy before it even gets going.  Next is ""Wounded Knee Creek"", a collaboration between
    Purple Confusion and Bartuf which works well in two respects: Not only does the song, a driving neo-shoegaze
    romp that smacks as much of M83 as it does of power-pop, propel the album with enough energy to sustain the
    subsequent few tracks, it also segues perfectly into the pitch-shifted squeals that introduce Mils' heady
    remix of Atoms Family's ""High on Life"".  That track, though built upon fairly straightforward verse-exchange,
    is pulled to shreds by wanton electronics and reassembled as breakcore.  Listening to it is akin to
    nose-breathing underwater.</p><p>
    From there, <i>Gooom Tracks</i> loses nary a step throughout its rousing first half.  KG's airy, Rhodes-driven
    ""S.P.E.C.T.R.E.2"" offers a refreshing counterpoint to the aggressive Mils track, and is anchored by just
    enough melancholia to keep the lithe instrumentation from blowing away.  Featuring an intoxicating vocal
    melody courtesy of Computer Pink, this deceptively complex track is easily the album's most affecting
    moment. Similarly effective, though not quite to the same degree, are songs by Steve &amp; Rob, Erich Zahn
    (ft. Moughqual), and follow-up appearances by Purple Confusion and Cyann &amp; Ben.  Even The Atoms Family's
    ham-fisted, unmolested verses on Abstrackt Keal Agram's ""Street Lamp Confession"" fail to disrupt to the
    album's structure.</p><p>
    Unlike most samplers, <i>Gooom Tracks, Vol. 2</i> is sectioned into two distinct sides, and begs for vinyl
    bifurcation.  Its diffuse first side delves into various styles, but remains strong, track-for-track.  The
    cloistered strumming, Gregorian harmonizing, and sucrose electronics of Mils' ""Mardi"", as performed by
    Cyann &amp; Ben, offers an ideal bookend to side one, and sheds entirely new light on Mils after their
    ambiguous earlier appearance.  Until this point, <i>Gooom Tracks</i> is impressively solid by any measure,
    and downright spectacular by mixtape standards.  The album is holistically disjointed, roundabout in
    sequence, yet uniquely adherent.  Unfortunately, young labels are in many ways like young artists, and
    their early samplers often resemble debut albums.  <i>Gooom Tracks</i> is thus typically frontloaded, and
    though ""side two"" has its share of promising moments, it seldom approaches the great heights of its opening
    half.</p><p>
    The first misstep is the inclusion of Es La Guerilla's interpretation of Cosmodrome's ""E-Mail Diamant"".  As
    soon as the wistful embers of ""Mardi"" have fully vaporized, part deux is reigned in by a impudent onslaught
    of nu-metal guitars that confuses more than it offends.  If nothing else, the song proves Gooom jack of all
    niches, but is otherwise a somewhat awkward fit, and a harbinger of strange things to come.  The remainder
    of <i>Gooom Tracks</i> is a markedly subdued affair, as if the people who put together the compilation felt
    the entire second side was needed to shake the hangover from Es La Guerilla's jarring assault.</p><p>
    Curiously, the album's biggest names are reserved for its dusky tail end: M83, the stargazing stalwarts that
    first garnered Gooom attention in the States, are here remixed by Múm.  ""Violet Tree (Violent Tree Mix)"" is
    a brooding, minimalist dirge of atmospheric synths, crackling noise, and sporadic rhythmic punctuation that
    hints at the darker direction Múm have taken with their music.  Capping the record is a high-profile
    collaboration between Dorine Muraille and Prefuse 73 (in found sound effigy).  The song's title, ""When
    Someone Dies, His Card Is Demagnetized"", is a grim, postmodern epithet, and appropriately, the track is a
    bleak process piece that ends Gooom Tracks on a pensive off-note.</p><p>
    For all its eclecticism, this album is surprisingly cohesive for a work of its kind.  <i>Gooom Tracks</i>
    plays like more of a soundtrack than a sampler, and would probably be received warmly in goodie bags at
    the upcoming Cannes festival.  But the label's doctrines are still truer to teens spinning records in
    their bedrooms than to the world of high culture.  <i>Gooom Tracks, Vol. 2</i> occasionally awes, but more
    important is the feeling it gives that anyone could do this, and these songs are surely more than enough
    impetus for a new crop of laptop maestros to start.</p></div>"|2042.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2042-gooom-tracks-vol-2/|7.5|Sam Ubl

    Haven last November.  The band played in the backyard of a Yale co-op, on the second floor of a run-down
    barn that housed everything from pirate ship blueprints, to snubbed cubist attempts, to what I think
    might've been a '57 Chevy.  The wood and nails that held the barn together had been loosened by repeated
    ivy league fetes of women, cocaine, and horse racing, to the point that when the 80 people in attendance
    began jumping around during the band's mid-set performance of ""The Electric Slide"", the floor collapsed:
    Skulls and bones started breaking, and we all had this awesome band to thank for our hospital bills and
    a perfectly unrequited night.</p><p>
    
    I was supposed to buy The Narrator's seven-inch after the show but couldn't because of the unpleasantness,
    so it was with death-defying anticipation that I cracked open the <i>Youth City Fire</i> EP, the Chicago
    quartet's Flameshovel debut.  It's uneven, and the vocals range from painfully melodramatic to sadly
    insecure, but there are bright glimmers of that D.C.-informed punk rock energy that quite literally brought
    down the house.</p><p>
    
    The warp-speed crowd-noise montage that kick-starts ""Culture/Counts"" finally gives way to PiL-dirty guitar
    slashes and thick drumming that, though not the crispest, rivals pretty much anything on Dischord in terms
    of sheer energy.  There's a similar crash-and-burn aesthetic to ""All Are Assassins"", which, at under two
    minutes, manages some potent contrasts and a climactic breakdown/handclap-buildup that flat-out kills in
    a live setting.</p><p>
    
    As instrumentalists, The Narrator are tighter than one might expect from a band that's only been around a
    year and a half; as songwriters, they're burying really slick riffs deep into their mix-- it's the vocals
    that hold the <i>Youth City Fire</i> EP back.  Producer Greg Norman (who's recorded Guided by Voices and
    90 Day Men, among others) desperately tries to keep the vocals from being overly exposed, but all too often,
    it's to no avail-- the energy's there, but the tonality and confidence are not, which is especially dangerous
    when The Narrator aren't at breakneck speed, such as on the ersatz Sonic Youth noodlander ""We Call Police""
    or the confusing emo waltz ""Horse with Blinders"".</p><p>
    
    Those two songs are dangerous slip-ups on an already short EP, which is why the stunning first two minutes
    of closer ""The Electric Slide"" are so critical for this young band.  This may be the most bad-ass opening
    of a rock song I've heard so far this year: the call of quiet single-line guitar intervals, snare rim
    tapping, and a bitter chorus of ""Fight! Fight! The Winners! The Winners!"" beget increasingly monstrous
    responses and some fantastic bass work towards the end of movement.  It's glorious-- until The Narrator
    drops the old ""can you feel the cancer spread inside me"" line, but fine, whatever. <i>Youth City Fire</i>,
    for all its shortcomings, harbors some seriously potent rock moments.  Let's hope the band can manage some
    self-censorship on future releases without sacrificing the energy that makes them so compelling live.</p></div>"|5895.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5895-youth-city-fire-ep/|6.0|Nick Sylvester

    with December's cigarette butts still suspended in February's frozen amber puddles, the cold snap finally
    snapped, and thermometers inched above zero degrees.  Just to feel the sun cut through the blustery wind
    promised the approach of spring, and it was then that I relied on vibraphonist Roy Ayers to help soundtrack
    and celebrate warm weather's imminent return.  Best known for ""Everybody Loves the Sunshine"", Ayers and his
    vibes are like those same solar rays on your skin; for me, this batch of grooves was a salve for staving
    off seasonal depression.</p><p>
    
    Not quite on par with, say, James Brown uncovering hours of tape from his on-the-one prime, the promise of
    prodigious unreleased songs from the peak of Ayers' powers is reason to take notice nonetheless.  Since his
    1963 debut, Ayers has worked with everyone from Herbie Mann and Guru to Fela Kuti and Erykah Badu, and his
    shimmering sound has foreshadowed acid jazz and fueled hip-hop, as well as gracing contemporary R&amp;B.;  Though
    <i>Virgin Ubiquity</i> is billed as a collection of thirteen never-before-released tracks, it's far more
    than a mere scrap heap of outtakes, as each of its ""from the vault"" cuts luxuriate on the comfortable musical
    bed that Ayers mastered from '76 through '81.</p><p>
    
    Originally of the hard bop school, Ayers embraced the strains of black music coming from the radio,
    incorporating more R&amp;B; smoothness and disco push into his jazz-based playing.  That so-slick sound of joy
    reverberates through titles like ""What's the T?"" and ""Green and Gold"", proving the vibed tinges of his
    loving funk to be almost ageless.  The only suggestion of dating comes from the revolving cast of ladybirds,
    who imitate the leather-lunged female vocal style of the day, piercing through the brass and bass in the
    manner of disco-divas like Patti LaBelle and Minnie Riperton.  The wailing of both Merry Clayton and Sylvia
    Cox counteracts the otherwise mellow bump of ""Brand New Feeling"", as they match the analog sine waves with
    some dog-whistling of their own.  But when both ladies lay off the caterwauling, the vibraslap and horn
    lines recline like a cat napping in a patch of warm light.  More soothing is Carla Vaughn, who would go
    on to sing with Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.  Here, she flutters on suave yet tricky tracks like ""Mystic Voyage
    (Version)"" and ""Boogie Down"" (wherein she urges her lover with the undeniable order ""pour yourself on me"").</p><p>
    
    ""I Am Your Mind', the final track, is the most driving of the 13 presented here, its hard, snapping bass
    underpinning the multi-tracked whispers, which are a curious bit of what could only be considered
    ""solipsistic funk.""  Knowing that the head keeps the body from unleashing the freedom that resides within,
    Ayers, on this unearthed set, echoes the paradigm of another long-lived head-funker: Free your mind and
    your ass will follow.</p></div>"|434.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/434-virgin-ubiquity-unreleased-recordings-1976-1981/|7.3|Andy Beta

Bob Dylan's
    battered face appears, quickly and suddenly, augmented by an erstwhile tangle of black hair, a creepy
    pencil-mustache, and gently-swiped eyeliner.  Dylan freezes and squints, expressionless, save a fleeting
    bit of blue eye-twitch, wherein it momentarily seems possible that he's about to start snickering out of
    his nose.  A remix of 1997's ""Love Sick"" blares.  The clip cuts back to the model, now glaring confrontationally,
    quasi-seductively arching her back.  A logo appears.</p><p>
    
    It might be 2004's strangest 30 seconds of television broadcast.</p><p>
    
    My favorite thing about Bob Dylan's Victoria's Secret commercial is the (not so farfetched) possibility that
    there are viewers in America who won't recognize Dylan's smarmy mug, and, incapable of sketching a line from
    his figure to the song playing in the background, must contend with an otherwise preposterous cameo, a
    wrinkled, peculiar-looking man nonsensically interrupting the provocative struts of an underwear model
    selling prepackaged titillation.  Without the proper context, it's impossible to know that the weathered
    face peering awkwardly at the camera once hocked his very own brand of shockingly alluring taboos, as
    furtive and dangerous as pink satin bras and lace-edged panties.</p><p>
    
    Despite the fact that Bob Dylan has been steadily burrowing deeper and deeper into the studied Americana
    canon, he was once the voice of the counterculture, slouching shoulder-to-shoulder with Allen Ginsberg and
    the radical left.  That Dylan was previously embraced by the anti-establishment seems perfectly apropos--
    liking Bob Dylan in 2004 is, as it was nearly 40 years ago, an entirely counterintuitive move.  His voice,
    nasal and impossibly garbled, is one of the pitchiest and most uncompromising in the history of American
    popular music.  He's generally cranky, a seething and cantankerous figure in interviews.  He has been
    touring forever, playing bad venues for stupidly high ticket prices, occasionally forgetting the lyrics
    to his own songs and puttering around onstage, distracted and annoyed.</p><p>
<i>Live 1964</i>, recorded on Halloween night at New York's Philharmonic Hall, is Bob Dylan's first
    all-acoustic live record, and is most noteworthy for its gooey formative circumstances: This is pre-Dylan
    Dylan, an impeccably recorded portrait of the guitar-toting folk singer, the giggling, sheepish heir to
    Woody Guthrie's dusty proletariat throne, a Dylan who had yet to wail electric at Newport, convert to
    Christianity, or write and star in <i>Masked and Anonymous</i>.  Charming and curiously personable, Dylan
    seems deliriously comfortable on stage, engaging an appreciative audience (no hollers of ""Judas!""), even
    enlisting their help with the first verse of ""I Don't Believe You"", asking, after a bungled opening, ""Does
    anyone know the first verse of this song?""  Featuring only longtime-cohort Joan Baez (who appears on four
    tracks) and his own harmonica and guitar, <i>Live 1964</i> is a spare, earnest portrayal of neo-Dylan-in-training,
    a man who, having long mastered one form, is just a few years away from revolutionizing another.</p><p>
    
    October 1964 was a tumultuous time in America, both politically and socially: American presence in Vietnam
    was gradually swelling, Communist China had successfully detonated its first atomic bomb, and, with civil
    rights battles still raging strong, racial tensions made for profoundly tense streets.  The presumed
    anti-politics of <i>Another Side of Bob Dylan</i>, released just three months earlier, had already earned
    Dylan a slap on the wrist from the more radical folk factions, who resented Dylan's irresponsible dip into
    personal whimsy.  But a couple listens to <i>Live 1964</i> promptly reveals the post-<i>Another Side</i>
    Dylan as the same defiantly stubborn protest singer, as staunchly concerned with the fate of his country
    as he was with his own heart.</p><p>
    
    The sixth installment in Dylan's Bootleg Series, <i>Live 1964</i> includes the infamous ""Talkin' John Birch
    Paranoid Blues"", which inspired Dylan to stroll off the set of <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i> earlier that year
    (unsurprisingly, network officials wouldn't let him play it on-air) and didn't earn official release until
    1991.  ""Talkin'"" sees Dylan caustically mocking McCarthyism and mumbling, ""It's a fictitious story,"" before
    jovially belting about his induction into the John Birch society, wherein he scours his sofa, rose bush,
    chimney, and toilet bowl for ""commies,"" and finally indicts both himself and Betsy Ross (who mistakenly
    included red stripes in the American flag).</p><p>
    
    Dylan's comedic timing was at its apex in '64, growling perfect punchlines (""I heard some footsteps by the
    front porch door/ So I grabbed my shotgun from the floor/ I snuck around the house with a huff and a hiss,
    saying hands up, you communist!/ It was the mailman/ He punched me out"") every single time.  Even Dylan's
    muttered introduction to ""Who Killed Davey Moore?,"" a wordy indictment of the media-fueled death of boxer
    Davey Moore, is caustically hilarious: ""This is a song about a boxer.  It's got nothing to do with boxing,
    it's a song about a boxer.  And it's not even having to do with the boxer, really... This has been taken
    out of the newspapers, and nothing has been changed.  Except the words.""</p><p>
    
    Over the course of two sets, Dylan enthusiastically strums his way through now-classics ""The Times They Are
    A-Changin"" and ""Mr. Tambourine Man"", but some of his lesser-known wonders are the most impressive: ""Mama,
    You Been on My Mind"" (later covered by Johnny Cash on 1965's <i>Orange Blossom Special</i>) sees Baez
    diva-howling before turning expectedly to Bob, who grumbles, ""I don't do that.""  Both Baez and Dylan seem
    to be perpetually swallowing laughs, bellowing together in a weird, perfect harmony.</p><p>
<i>Live 1964</i> isn't Dylan at his most explosive, or most innovative, but it does capture a Bob Dylan
    just starting to shed his folkist skin, folding in bizarre bits and signs of what would later become a
    full-on folk apocalypse.  As primetime television so eagerly attests, a lot has changed since Bob Dylan
    first played New York on Halloween.  But he remains fiercely anachronistic, a little out of place, and
    always on the verge of a big, snarky chortle.  And that self-satisfied air of mystery might just be sexy
    enough to sell some underwear.</p></div>"|2500.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2500-the-bootleg-series-vol-6-live-1964-concert-at-philharmonic-hall/|9.1|Amanda Petrusich

    and a host of No-Wave acts-- references that owe as much to their bandname's tribute to a DNA song as to
    Blonde Redhead's often discordant noise-rock.  That rhetoric, of course, should've been shelved after the
    release of <em>Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons</em>.  I only felt I should mention it again because, apparently,
    many of their party-line detractors never got the memo.  By <em>Melody</em>, much of Blonde Redhead's feedback-laced
    art-rock had given way to brittle pop and arm's-length romanticism, yet somehow they still caught flak for
    the sound they had already largely outgrown.  Just saying, is all: What used to be true is now tired, and,
    with the release of <em>Misery Is a Butterfly</em>, such knee-jerk dismissals can finally be considered
    irrelevant.</p><p>
    On <em>Melody</em>, the band's artistic growing pains had already become evident, most notably in the
    wide-eyed, fairytale pining of ""This Is Not"", a vibrant synth-ballad that-- like the first protuberance
    of wing from a cocoon-- threatened to split the seams of their style-damaged rock wide open.  That's not
    just flowery critic-speak, either-- Kazu Makino and the Pace twins (Amadeo and Simone) split from Touch
    &amp; Go Records and financed their latest recording themselves, because, according to Simone, they ""didn't
    want to have any kind of limits with what [they] wanted to do as far as expenses; with Touch &amp; Go, sometimes
    things were a little tight.""</p><p>
    The confidence that led them to strike out on their own-- even before 4AD expressed interest in the album--
    is impressive.  But more striking is how clearly that confidence has translated to their music.  Freed
    from all constraints, Blonde Redhead are beautifully reborn on <em>Misery Is a Butterfly</em>.  True,
    feelings of loss, insecurity, and outright alienation do factor heavily into the record's thematic
    vision (this butterfly isn't called ""Misery"" for nothing), but the band's sense of assuredness surrounds
    the album's themes of vulnerability.
    </p><p>
<em>Misery Is a Butterfly</em> was recorded before being shopped to a label, but judging by the sound of the
    album, its eventual release on 4AD seems to have been an inevitability.  From track one, the record is lacy
    and moody, perfectly suited to the one-time home of the Cocteau Twins and This Mortal Coil.  The word ""lush""
    doesn't quite capture the fluttering whirls of strings, keyboards, and delicately plucked guitar that open
    ""Elephant Woman""; I'd go so far as to label such enveloping richness of instrumentation ""baroque,"" perhaps
    even ""rococo.""
    </p>
<p>
    For Blonde Redhead's latest incarnation, the softer production simply serves as polish for tarnished, tired
    guitar, drums and keyboards.  Here, the bristling energy that once held would-be sympathizers at bay has
    been turned inward, resulting in an unprecedented illusion of warmth.  ""Anticipation"", for example, ventures
    into completely foreign territory for the band; it's vulnerable, yet remains emotionally available, and is
    breathtaking even in comparison to the band's most typically pretty compositions.  Never before have Makino's
    gentle whispers seemed so genuine or close at hand.  The psychedelia-inflected title track and the fractured
    desolation of ""Falling Man"" also offer inviting hints of the underlying humanity Blonde Redhead had, until
    now, been so reluctant to display.
    </p>
<p>
    Of course, even now, that humanity may be little more than an apparition.  Their tales of heartache and
    desperation have cast Makino and Amadeo Pace-- the emotional heart of the band-- as tragically misunderstood,
    tortured poets who pin misery on their sleeves, never conceding that anyone else could be capable of
    understanding their pain.  And despite the more inviting nature of <em>Misery</em>'s music and production,
    they remain insular and distant here, as well.  Only on ""Anticipation"" are Makino's vocals as beckoning
    as their musical surroundings; elsewhere, Blonde Redhead remain as they've always been: beautiful and
    vacant.
    </p>
<p>
    But they excel at being just that.  It bears repeating that <em>Misery Is a Butterfly</em> is a gorgeous
    achievement.  Parrying the double-edged sword of pathos in music-- the ""emo"" trap, if you will-- Blonde
    Redhead have perfected their own unusual strain of perceived insincerity.  They said it themselves, and
    it still rings true: ""Fake can be just as good.""  Though this album's lustrous ornamentation is often
    placed at odds with its halting vocals, Blonde Redhead are wise enough to embrace their own imperfections.
    They once espoused the merits of loving another despite our faults, and it shouldn't be hard for fans to
    seize on that sage advice.  <em>Misery Is a Butterfly</em> makes it easy.
    </p>

When America exited World War II and entered the most comfortable era in
    its existence, national insecurity largely seemed obsolete-- at least to the privileged few who didn't need
    to worry about civil or sexual discrepancies.  Consequently, anyone who was anyone figured out that real
    passion was in music, sex, drugs, and crass, florescent wallpaper.  Of course, artists, musicians and
    poets were the first to realize just how open the American landscape had become, but eventually, even
    your grandparents were growing sideburns and listening to Les Baxter go all Bora Bora.  Somehow a ""counter
    culture"" embraced the tip of an iceberg of buzzwords that helped define modern America: Diversity, Equality,
    Understanding.</p><p>
    Eclecticism is more attainable when you don't have to sweat the basic shit.  This explains why you don't
    find many abstract IDM artistes or jazz hipsters in Tibet.  It's not that there isn't a wealth of worthy
    artistic muse in Tibet (or any other land); I imagine life is generally more interesting elsewhere.  Perhaps
    there is little point in celebrating the world's diversity when daily, local life presents more than enough
    on which one can concentrate.  It must have seemed exotic to listen to Asian gongs and Tahitian rhythms
    filtered through the corniest big band imaginable to our grandparents.  It must have seemed really deep to
    paste throat-singing monks over Moog patterns to our parents.  And I suppose it's a nifty thing to hear
    African drums put to use as undie hip-hop backing tracks today.  None of this is inherently bad, and much
    of it is curiously comforting.  Yet, it's also necessarily superficial; all part of the price we pay for
    having a decent national infrastructure and oceans on both sides.</p><p>
    Chicago's Hu Vibrational is Adam Rudolph (Pharoah Sanders, Yusef Lateef) and celebrated modern jazz drummer
    Hamid Drake, and <i>Beautiful: Boonghee Music 2</i> is their second release.  Their first, <i>Boonghee
    Music</i>, was an EP for Prefuse 73 mastermind Scott Herren's Eastern Developments label.  Rudolph and
    Drake perform music on more ethnic percussion than you can shake a rain stick at: kalimba, Cajon, Udu drum,
    qarqarba, slit drum, gimbre, Dusu'ngoni, talking drum, surdo and even bamboo flutes.  Yet, this is no jungle
    meeting of the new-age crystal shaman priests; rather, it's a neo-easy listening funk party.  Where Martin
    Denny would have lulled you into a Utopian tropical paradise, Hu Vibrational want to chill you out with
    James Brown beats and trip-hop moves played on instruments otherwise best suited for indigenous ritual
    ceremonies or tribal war dances.  If it didn't all go down so smoothly, I might say it was ""wild"" and ""free.""</p><p>
<i>Beautiful</i> is a low-key exercise in world-music templates applied to hypnotic, almost minimalist groove.
    The two percussionists perform short etudes using their array of strange sounding devices, constructing
    contemporary propulsion from ancient skin and blocks of wood.  ""On the Now (for Big Black)"" (no, not that
    Big Black; it's the alias of Afro-Cuban jazz percussionist Danny Ray) comes on like a tropical slow jam,
    shakers providing the pulse for the bellowing on-the-one of talking drum (which sounds very much like a
    tabla).  Carlos Niño (aka DJ and producer Ammon Contact) gets credit for producing this album, and he might
    well have contributed to the no-nonsense, uninterrupted beat play of this track and much of the rest of
    <i>Beautiful</i>.  ""Joyful Road"" offers a steadily busy trap kit beat from Drake under which Rudolph heads
    to the South Pacific via mallets and tuned wood yet never strays too far from good, old-fashioned boogaloo
    funk.  Eclectic, indeed.</p><p>
    IDM artist-cum-hip-hop producer Daedelus guests on two tracks, but rather than provide samples off archaic
    LPs, he plays guitar.  ""Feet on a Beautiful Planet"" uses more talking drum and kalimba (something like an
    African xylophone) to provide color, as guitar lends the track a Brazilian flair in places.  In comparison,
    ""Sunkissed"" sounds much more like a ""song,"" as Drake supplies the uptempo funk pulse, and Daedelus' chord
    progression suggests introspection while still lending a little structure to an otherwise open-ended jam.
    In fact, it's the freer moments on this album that offer the most lasting impressions: ""In the Here"" has a
    steady pulse, but an understated solo performance throughout from Rudolph on talking drum.  Its handclaps
    lend the piece a spontaneous feel, even if its basic outline is efficiency in the extreme.  Likewise,
    ""Friends and Gardens (for Don Cherry)"" is a small celebration of bell-like sounds, buoyant Island funk and
    Rudolph's persistent whisper vocal.  At its best, Hu Vibrational's concise improvisation is contagiously
    alluring.</p><p>
    I might have wished master musicians such as Drake and Rudolph would have performed something a little more
    weighty than the short, beat-driven tracks on <i>Beautiful</i>, but then, the album falls right in line with
    a legacy of exotica best heard on evenings or afternoons with a glass of wine and suitably sophisticated
    company.  This stuff might ultimately be background music, but it's a been a while since that was synonymous
    with saying it's bad-- far be it from me to deny its charms.  Eclecticism doesn't always work in art (or
    perhaps in life), but it certainly has its luxurious moments.  If you can stand the florescent wallpaper,
    there's a lot to enjoy.</p></div>"|3980.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3980-beautiful-boonghee-music-2/|6.9|Dominique Leone

    that it's a commercially motivated attempt to reach a larger audience.  More importantly, if that record is
    a cover album of American standards, the endeavor unavoidably becomes a political statement-- especially at
    this particular moment in time.  Whether or not Brazilian vocalist Caetano Veloso intended this covers album
    of American standards-- his first full-length performed entirely in English-- to be overtly political is
    debatable.  But in his liner notes, he writes somewhat apologetically: ""People all over the world would like
    to find a way of thanking American popular music for having made their lives and their music richer and more
    beautiful.  Many try.  So do I.""</p><p>
    
    On one level, <i>A Foreign Sound</i> is an act of appropriation, a kind of reverse musical imperialism, much
    like Cornershop covering ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"" in Punjabi.  In addition to American chestnuts
    by Cole Porter and Rodgers &amp; Hart, Veloso covers songs by artists who have borrowed from Brazilian traditions,
    including the Talking Heads and Arto Lindsay.  Even on songs that have no musical ties to Brazil, Veloso
    exerts his elegant phrasing and supple voice to make them sound new.  For example, Nirvana's ""Come As You
    Are"" becomes a low-key groove, its signature guitar line rendered as a mysterious, burbling funk, as Veloso
    emphasizes Cobain's pronunciation of the word memory as ""memoria,"" a move that here takes on special linguistic
    significance.</p><p>
    
    On another level, at a time when U.S.-bashing is a popular global pastime, <i>A Foreign Sound</i> plays like
    an eloquent defense of American cultural imperialism.  In that regard, the album's most impressive aspect is
    the generous scope of Veloso's vision: He is just as interested in more recent fare like ""Come As You Are""
    and Stevie Wonder's ""If It's Magic"" as he is in standards such as George and Ira Gershwin's ""The Man I Love""
    and Irving Berlin's ""Blue Skies"".  Despite the lack of any American country music or blues, the breadth of
    Veloso's overview of American music-- as well as his acknowledgement that phrasing and melody contribute
    just as much to a song's national character as its lyrics-- elevates <i>A Foreign Sound</i> well above the
    standard standards dreck dispensed obligatorily by twilight has-beens like Rod Stewart or Cyndi Lauper.</p><p>
    
    But <i>A Foreign Sound</i> is more impressive as a musical statement than as a political one.  Veloso aims
    to reinterpret these songs, to make them sound new and foreign to American ears.  And for the most part he
    succeeds.  His nearly a cappella version of Cole Porter's ""Love for Sale"" draws out the gutter pathos in
    the original's over-polished lyrics, and Berlin's ""Blue Skies""-- which closes the album-- hasn't sounded
    this good since Willie Nelson covered it on <i>Stardust</i>.  On the other hand, Veloso's version of Bob
    Dylan's ""It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)""-- perhaps chosen for the relevance of its message-- is a
    lamentable misstep, as is his precious reading of the Civil War ballad-turned-Elvis Presley hit ""Love Me
    Tender"".  But these flaws are perhaps merely the result of the length of the album (22 tracks) and are
    easily forgivable; after all, who else could make ""Feelings"" sound fresh and unironic?</p><p>
    
    Translating these songs with wit, grace, and intelligence, Veloso reinvigorates them in what could be
    considered an act of diplomacy.  <i>A Foreign Sound</i> demonstrates how nations can meld the best of
    their cultures and traditions in a mutual give-and-take, a feat which makes the album a triumph both
    musically and politically.</p></div>"|8429.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8429-a-foreign-sound/|8.8|Stephen M. Deusner

Over the years, the label has cultivated a uniform aesthetic,     with many of its artists seeming like overdone, mock-innocent caricatures.  Though there are exceptions to     the rule, Mirah stands out as a genuine persona, and rarely, if ever, does she stoop to the sort of corduroy     foppery that characterizes many of her labelmates.  On a label of self-styled misfits and singing eremites,     Mirah is perhaps the only true enigma.  Her tenuously confident voice revels and never wallows in its     shyness, and though she has her share of precious moments (see ""La Familia""), her songs are neither     understated nor overbearing.  The Microphones' Phil Elvrum might be a real-life hermit, but his mysterious     personality is impertinent to his talent; Mirah, meanwhile, can dominate a stage in diva-like fashion, and     the experience of hearing her sing is all the more moving for the sense that she's doing something that     takes a tremendous wealth of talent.</p>
<p>On <i>To All We Stretch the Open Arm</i>, Ms. Yom Tov Zeitlyn conspires with Seattle's The Black Cat     Orchestra to render a generation-spanning panoply of folk songs from a variety of locales.  The album--     Mirah's first for Yoyo Records (but not her last for K)-- is structured around a theme of rebellion and     dissent; its dozen tracks consist of covers of songs from periods of war and strife.  But while it's about     time someone united Bob Dylan with his centennial antecedent, Civil War troubadour Stephen Foster, this     album does little justice to the songs and causes it represents, and ultimately feels like a pointless     exercise.</p>
<p>Perplexingly, Mirah's dexterous voice is subdued throughout much of <i>To All We Stretch</i>.  It seems no     great pains were taken to mix these recordings; every instrument sounds remarkably flat, as if the band     just close-mic'd one of their rehearsals and pressed record.  Of course, this four-track technique is     hardly revolutionary, but it's nevertheless surprising coming from Mirah, whose albums have always found     clever ways to avoid the sterility implicit in most lo-fi pop.</p>
<p>Besides being hackneyed, the homespun feel of this recording fundamentally clashes with the populist nature     of its material.  Revolutions don't happen in Olympia bedrooms, and while many of these songs have grassroots,     they were doubtless written with a larger audience in mind.  For a message to be of import, the vehicle in     which it's delivered needs to feel significant, too, and <i>To All We Stretch the Open Arm</i> is diminutive     in stature.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, the band is equally flaccid.  Rather than give the songs (some of which date to before     recording technology) a modern update, the Black Cats render them verbatim, exaggerating their lugubrious     tempos.  ""Si Me Quieres Escribir"" and ""El Cant Dels Ocells"" sound particularly amateurish, laboring in the     saturnine dynamics that come to typify this record.  There would seem to be immense potential in rehashing     songs that are more than a century old, but Mirah and the Orchestra have failed to find it.  The album's     strongest numbers are its most modern, including a cover of Dylan's ""Dear Landlord"", which features Mirah's     most charming vocal performance on the album.  Likewise, two original songs, ""The Light"" and ""How Sweetly     Friendship Binds"", show promise, but are ultimately stifled by the band's indifferent performance.</p>
<p>Protest songs that are anchored by a very specific place and time are period pieces, and are therefore     difficult to execute outside their quaint confines.  A song about the Civil War is nothing if not a     historical document; trying to resurrect its temporal relevance in lieu of a situation that dovetails     less than perfectly with the circumstances under which it was conceived is an ill-fated endeavor.  Because     of this, <i>To All We Stretch the Open Arm</i> is at an inherent disadvantage, and when coupled with the     Black Cat Orchestra's tepid performance, the album packs all the excitement of a Battle of Gettysburg     re-enactment.</p></div>"|5331.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5331-to-all-we-stretch-the-open-arm/|5.2|Sam Ubl

    becomes easily pronounceable.  A combination of Charlie Parker's ""Ah-Leu-Ch"" and ""Zapatista,"" the name is
    meant to suggest both the instrumental band's politics in lieu of lyrics (the long-short: they align
    themselves with the oppressed and marginalized) and their approach to music.  No, they don't play anything
    you could even remotely call ""bop,"" but the improvisational élan that Bird and his contemporaries brought
    to music is definitely the order of the day.  Ahleuchatistas do their version of bop in a manner more
    reminiscent of mid-70s King Crimson or the on-and-off Laswell/Frith/Hayward project Massacre and-- although
    this is just their first album-- they pull it off surprisingly well.</p><p>
    The trio hails from Asheville, North Carolina, a picturesque town in the Appalachians I previously knew
    only from a quick news bit about a pickled frog being found at a local fast food joint.  Which makes some
    sense: the band's sound is definitely more pickled frog than it is bucolic mountain scenery.  The interplay
    ranges from ridiculously tight, turn-on-a-pinhead careening to barely controlled chaos, and all points
    between.  Just when you think they've lost the plot completely, they hit you with a fistful of razor blades
    and march lockstep over your corpse with odd-metered, pants-soiling grooves.</p><p>
    Seriously, recording a nearly hour-long album with nothing but a guitar, bass and drums-- there's nary a
    guest vocal or even a sample to lean on-- without boring you, me, and both of our mothers half to death is
    tricky stuff, but I dare say Ahleuchatistas have done it.  Guitarist Shane Perlowin is apparently allergic
    to all effects aside from reverb, but bassist Derek Poteat makes up for that with varying shades of
    scuzzbucket fuzz and tastefully employed chorus and octave pedals.  Drummer Sean Dail keeps his kit
    stripped and makes the most of just a few basic sounds.  His hi-hat control is especially impressive,
    and it essentially makes a couple of these songs all on its own.</p><p>
    The AK-47s and apocalyptic gore that bristle from the album artwork don't take long to materialize, rising
    in a methodical swell on the cacophonous ""Intro"" and blazing in full glory on ""The Machines Became Cognizant"".
    On that track, Perlowin's clean-tone clusters buzz like an angry hive of bees as the drums scatter and the
    bass stretches out into a percolating pattern.  ""Lacerate"" is all odd meters and dynamic interplay, the
    band flipping between ballet shoes and combat boots, while Dail's hi-hat pushes the final charge at breakneck
    speed.  ""A Thought Like a Hammer"" steps it up further still, with guitar figures that you could even call
    catchy and pummeling bursts of violent riffage.</p><p>
    Ahleuchatistas take a break from the bloodsport on ""I Don't Remember Falling Asleep Here"", an elegiac
    meditation of sparse guitar and growling, pitch-shifted bass.  And they save two of the nastiest tracks
    for last: ""Empath/Every"" starts with a lulling melodic passage and weird counterrhythmic guitar runs,
    but builds naturally to a punishing head with distorted bass, boiling guitar, and flagellant drumming.
    Meanwhile, ""Lament for Bhopal"" (the title of which references a 1984 Methyl Isocyanate leak at a Union
    Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal, India that killed thousands and still causes birth defects in the region)
    opens with a dark descent into entropic noisemaking and moves between quiet menace and brutal assault with
    frightening purpose.</p><p>
    This all makes for a record that will surely be exhausting for people who aren't into instrumental confrontation.
    For those who are, however, it's supremely rewarding.  Listening to this record reminded me of having my
    mind blown by the first Massacre album, and though it's not quite up to that standard, it's certainly close.
    The real test for Ahleuchatistas will be to see if they can improve on this their next time out, but for
    now, <i>On the Culture Industry</i> is one hell of a starting place-- and worthy of all the pretension their
    bandname implies.</p></div>"|431.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/431-on-the-culture-industry/|7.8|Joe Tangari

After all, between their attachments
    to the Chicago arts scene, their chic appropriation of 1960s pop, and their attachment to co-conspirators
    Jim O'Rourke and John McEntire, the expectations for the band can sometimes seem unreachable.  This, of
    course, doesn't mean that the duo of Frank and John Navin haven't bent over backward trying to match those
    expectations.  Ever since their third album, 1999's <i>Pedals</i>, was criticized for drowning its lilting
    Burt Bacharach-esque melodies in O'Rourke's over-elaborate production, they've taken a more simple,
    scaled-back approach to their arrangements.</p><p>
    
    On <i>Morehappyness</i>, their sixth album, the band has binned the saccharine orchestration of their early
    work to instead adopt an electronic finery similar to the neon-tinted new wave of the 1980s or The Magnetic
    Fields' early incursions into synthetic thrift-store pop.  The trouble is, on this second installment of
    their planned <i>Happyness</i> trilogy, the Navin brothers still struggle to sound more than the sum of
    their parts.</p><p>
    
    Much of why this record fails to catch fire lies in how-- compared to previous records <i>Pelo</i> and
    <i>Happyness</i>-- the songs seem melodically indistinct.  By ditching their baroque leanings, the Navins'
    songwriting has become more abstract, oblique, and in line with fellow Chicago pop experimentalists The Sea
    and Cake.  Yet while that band's tunes shuffle and meander their way into your consciousness, much of
    <i>Morehappyness</i> simply seems slight and unremarkable.  On ""Snowflake"", synths murmur, a deep bassline
    shudders and McEntire's drumming doles out a near-disco rhythm, but this otherwise competent backing is
    made redundant by the way John Navin's voice ineffectively grazes above the music.</p><p>
    
    The Navins' over-reliance on electronics is also somewhat restrictive: Their repeated use of similar-sounding,
    smooth keyboard lines is tiresome, and a greater variation in sound and structure would have been preferred.
    Because of this, the tracks which produce a greater impact tend to be those that incorporate organic elements.
    When John Navin's faint, graceful flutter of a voice blends with the faintly flicked guitar on ""Colored Town"",
    the result is a sparse, pillow-soft splendor.  Likewise, the penultimate ""Wheat and Tare"" is an indelibly
    beautiful fusion of slow piano and a subtle electronic undertow, featuring a divine middle-eight that could
    have been written for Dionne Warwick in the 1960s.</p><p>
<i>Morehappyness</i>, then, is a slow stretch of still-motion reverie and contemplation, augmented by
    attractive, understated melodies and arrangements, but The Aluminum Group's failing lies in their inability
    to replicate the splendid melodrama of their Bacharach-imbued early work within the confines of a new sound.
    Unfortunately, this shortcoming leaves both the songs and their presentation sounding a bit slender and
    a little too powerless.</p></div>"|142.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/142-morehappyness/|6.9|Neil Robertson

    had on the face of indie rock (Hives, I'm looking in your direction), one can hardly find an article on the
    man that doesn't in some way mention his early 90s stint as <i>Sassy</i> magazine's ""Sassiest Boy in America.""
    Ironic as the title might have been, it has somehow followed him through the years and managed to undermine
    his sincerity, as if the hilarity of the award is more a commentary on his credibility than on that of the
    now-defunct teen magazine.</p><p>
    As if in reaction to <i>Sassy</i>'s dubious distinction, or perhaps in an effort to heal his bruised cred,
    each of Svenonius' post-Nation of Ulysses efforts have been increasingly quirky in sound and approach.  The
    Make-Up drew inspiration from 60s-era psych-rock and emerged complete with an anti-establishment ethos and
    manifesto; Scene Creamers drenched its whimsical pop simplicity in sex and politics; and Weird War, on their
    self-titled debut, funneled a mélange of influences-- from Motown to prog-rock to 60s garage-- into an
    intense, reverb-heavy stew.</p><p>
    Since that first Weird War record, original member Neil Michael Hagerty (ex-Royal Trux) decided to leave
    the band in pursuit of the ever-elusive solo career, and Svenonius' Scene Creamers came under fire for
    allegedly choosing the same name as a group of French graffiti artists.  So with a founding member missing
    from one band and another bandname tied up in a legal dispute, what's a man to do?  The solution was surprisingly
    simple, and in what amounted to independent music's answer to corporate restructuring, Scene Creamers became
    Weird War for the release of <i>If You Can't Beat 'Em, Bite 'Em</i>.  And all was well.</p><p>
    But in spite of the band's convoluted pedigree, off-kilter image, and critic-ready, retro-garage-funk
    sound, the fact remains that <i>If You Can't Beat 'Em, Bite 'Em</i> is just not as interesting as it could
    be.  For all its experimental bluster and lyrical imagery, the end result is paradoxically both unique and
    mediocre, like a band merely treading water when it should be filling the pool with gasoline.</p><p>
    Style reigns supreme over substance here, and the whole album is bathed in a coat of 70s garage funk, with
    distorted percussion and buzzing guitars.  But while there's much to be said for a solid groove, something's
    just not right when a track goes flat before the two-minute mark: ""Store Bought Pot"" opens promisingly with
    a rhythm section straight out of any 70s sitcoms, but lacks variation and quickly beats itself into the
    ground under Svenonius' rap-like musings.  Unfortunately, the song's underdeveloped, monotonous groove
    typifies the project's shortcomings, as many of its songs are half-baked and needlessly stretched out
    minutes beyond their prime.</p><p>
    But then there are tracks like ""Grand Fraud"", whose fuzzy, MC5-esque rhythm section underpins its energetic,
    staccato vocals.  When the growling chorus kicks in here, the rhythm falls straight in line, stoking the
    fire as Svenonius snarls, ""There was a village with a witch and they decided to burn that bitch.""  Even the
    spoken word psych freakout ""One by One"", and the socially critical honky rap and falsetto chorus of ""AK-47""
    manage to keep just this side of ludicrous, lending more charm than dissonance or absurdity.</p><p>
    These are, however, exceptions to the rule, and sadly, <i>If You Can't Beat 'Em</i>'s moments of retro-chic
    accessibility are grossly outweighed by its general repetitiveness.  Most folks likely won't even make it
    past the lascivious intro, ""Music for Masturbation"".  But then, perhaps that what Svenonius intended.  Sassy,
    indeed.</p></div>"|8618.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8618-if-you-cant-beat-em-bite-em/|6.2|Jedediah Gilchrist

It's imperceptible in the scheme of a day or a week or even a year, but
    you are aging, and your body is degrading.  As your cells synthesize the very proteins that allow you to
    live, they also release free radicals, oxidants that literally perforate your tissue and cause you to grow
    progressively less able to perform as you did at your peak.  By the time you reach 80, you will literally
    be full of holes, and though you'll never notice a single one of them, you will inevitably feel their
    collective effect.  Aging and degradation are forces of nature, functions of living, and understanding
    them can be as terrifying as it is gratifying.</p><p>
    
    It's not the kind of thing you can say often, but I think William Basinski's <i>Disintegration Loops</i>
    are a step toward that understanding-- the music itself is not so much composed as it is this
    force of nature, this inevitable decay of all things, from memory to physical matter, made manifest in
    music.  During the summer of 2001, Basinski set about transferring a series of 20-year-old tape loops he'd
    had in storage to a digital file format, and was startled when this act of preservation began to devour the
    tapes he was saving.  As they played, flakes of magnetic material were scraped away by the reader head,
    wiping out portions of the music and changing the character and sound of the loops as they progressed,
    the recording process playing an inadvertent witness to the destruction of Basinski's old music.</p><p>
    
    The process may be the hook for this sprawling four-disc set, but the loops themselves are stunning,
    ethereal studies in sound so fluid that the listener scarcely registers the fact that it's nothing but
    many hundreds of repetitions of a brief, simple loop that they're hearing.  I imagine that
    life within the womb might sound something akin to these slowly swelling, beauteous snatches of orchestral
    majesty and memory-haze synthesizer.  The pieces are uniformly consonant, embellished with distant whalesong
    arpeggios and echoing percussion.</p><p>
    
    In essence, Basinski is improvising using nothing so much as the passage of time as his instrument, and the
    result is the most amazing piece of process music I've ever heard, an encompassing soundworld as lulling
    as it is apocalyptic.  A piece may begin bold, a striking, slow-motion slur of ecstatic drone, and in the
    first minute, you will notice no change.  But as the tape winds on over the capstans, fragments are lost or
    dulled, and the music becomes a ghost of itself, tiny gasps of full-bodied chords groaning to life amid
    pits of near-silence.  Some decay more quickly and violently than others, surviving barely 15 minutes
    before being subsumed by silence and warping, while the longest endures for well over an hour, fading into
    a far-off, barely perceptible glow.</p><p>
    
    There is another, eerier chapter to the story of the <i>Disintegration Loops</i>-- that Basinski was listening
    to the playbacks of his transfers as the attacks of September 11th unfolded, and that they became a sort of
    soundtrack to the horror that he and his friends witnessed from his rooftop in New York that day, a poignant
    theme for the cataclysmic editing of one of the world's most recognizable skylines.  Removed from the context
    of that disaster and transposed into the mundane world we live in every day, <i>The Disintegration Loops</i>
    still wield an uncanny, affirming power.  It's the kind of music that makes you believe there is a Heaven,
    and that this is what it must sound like.</p></div>"|577.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/577-the-disintegration-loops-i-iv/|9.4|Joe Tangari

For critics,
    it's all too easy: Just state the bandname and album title, discuss the intensity of the lead songwriter's
    Brian Wilson fixation, and critique him based on the effectiveness with which his band approximates <i>Pet
    Sounds</i>.  For extra points, drop words like ""hallucinogenic"" or ""sun-drenched"" in the review as often as
    possible, and-- if you're really good-- throw in a well-placed Curt Boettcher reference.  There you have it:
    Band X is another petty homage to 1960s California pop.</p><p>
    I often wonder why music fans aren't more resistant to this type of summary delineation; surely there's more
    to Jeff Magnum's twisted genius than a childish idolization of the Beach Boys, just as Will Cullen Hart's
    powers don't derive from something abnormal in the water he drank as a kid.  I suppose this critical tactic
    is prevalent because there really <i>are</i> artists who fit this simplistic bill, ones whose records are
    about as essential to a pop fan as the work of a bad Zeppelin knockoff would be to a metalhead.</p><p>
    I've always pegged Of Montreal as one of those inessential bands.  The only real adoration I've felt for any
    of their tracks is for ""Don't Ask Me to Explain"", a simplistic ditty from the band's debut LP that manages
    to do Weezer better than Weezer themselves.  And although Of Montreal haven't released a real dud in the
    band's eight-year recording life, the most engaging thing about their songs is often their longwinded,
    quasi-literary titles.  Evidently, the band has had trouble keeping the attention of record labels as well,
    spreading their seven-album yield amongst five different imprints.</p><p>
    Two years removed from <i>Aldhils Arboretum</i>, their last studio album of new material, the band has had--
    by Of Montreal standards-- a relatively long time to hone their sound and explore a more cohesive approach
    to songwriting, one less encumbered by oblique concepts.  Since 1997, Of Montreal have churned out roughly
    an LP a year, not to mention untold EPs, B-sides, and an effective collection of singles.  The group's
    longest previous respite between LPs was the two-year hiatus between <i>The Gay Parade</i> and <i>Coquelicot
    Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse</i>.  And while <i>Coquelicot</i> was clearly more
    ambitious than its predecessor, it wasn't a vast transformation in either quality or style.  All told,
    there was no reason to expect any great strides from this dependably generic quintet this time out, which
    makes <i>Satanic Panic in the Attic</i> all the more surprising.</p><p>
<i>Satanic Panic</i> displays a considerable maturation in Kevin Barnes' songwriting.  Everything, from the
    <i>Sgt. Pepper's</i>-copping album art to the wontedly verbose lyrics and song titles, would suggest a
    predictable collection of spindly psych-pop.  But when the music actually starts, the differences become
    apparent.  ""Disconnect the Dots"" begins with a Doppler-affected drum sample, before the abrupt appearance
    of both handclaps and a verifiably indelible guitar riff.  Seconds later, Barnes arrives, bearing an
    invitation: ""Come disconnect the dots with me, poppy,"" he intones, before deliquescing into a blissful
    mini-chorus.  From there, the song shifts effortlessly from section to section, orchestrating a dense but
    well-balanced array of organ drones, vocal harmonies, astral guitar peals, and interlocking electro-acoustic
    percussion.  And this is all in the album's first 4\xBD minutes.</p><p>
    ""Disconnect the Dots"" is more than just an album pacesetter-- it's a mission statement for a band remade,
    or at least reconsidered.  The new Of Montreal grab your attention, not deliberately invite it to wander,
    as the next track, ""Lysergic Bliss"", makes abundantly clear.  The song is perhaps most reminiscent of the
    band's earlier work, sluicing through multiple time and key changes with operatic grandiosity.  On a previous
    effort, the song's fragments might have either fallen apart from lack of a coherent vision or been mashed
    together to form a mottled soup of disparate ideas, but here, the track is handled with impressive finesse;
    even the bridge's extended a cappella harmonies have a natural flow.</p><p>
    Elsewhere, <i>Satanic Panic</i> frequently leans closer to Steely Dan than the Beach Boys, which lends a
    refreshing dose of realism to the implicit reverie of songs like ""My British Tour Diary"".  Elsewhere,
    ""Eros' Entropic Tundra"" and ""Erroneous Escape into Eric Eckles"" are both delicately refined, while still
    retaining Of Montreal's psychedelic salience.  And while the music hits with somewhat of a blunted edge,
    Barnes' harmonies are always unimpeachably catchy.</p><p>
    My naysaying of Of Montreal's earlier work is only meant to underscore the impressive growth displayed here.
    While albums such as <i>The Gay Parade</i> and <i>Coquelicot</i> often drowned in oppressive amounts of
    cheerfulness, it's possible to take <i>Satanic Panic</i> seriously while still enjoying even its stickiest
    melodies.  It may lack the raw inventiveness of a potential peer such as Olivia Tremor Control's <i>Dusk at
    Cubist Castle</i>, but Of Montreal are psych-pop of a different strain. <i>Satanic Panic in the Attic</i>
    is idiosyncratic without being hokey, and although the band has been stiffed recognition for the consistency
    of their previous work, this album should make the group much more difficult to ignore.</p></div>"|5954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5954-satanic-panic-in-the-attic/|8.3|Sam Ubl

    career attempting to claw his way out of little brotherdom.  Blame his goofy guitar stomps, moppish locks
    and toothy grin, or the enduring legacy of an infamously anticlimactic high school gig (the heavily hyped,
    quickly forgotten Radish), but know that Ben Kweller is having a crap of a time escaping our distracted
    head-pats and condescending smiles.  Check standard Kweller-crit protocol: The elders glance and chortle,
    crinkle their noses, dub him ""adorable!"" or ""a wunderkind,"" and then proceed with white-knuckled noogies.</p><p>
    
    Never mind that Kweller's scrappy, Violent Femmes-ish alt-rock is not really all that different from what
    his aged peers (see Evan Dando, Ben Folds) perpetually crank out, or that he's married, and 23, and two
    records into a fairly successful recording career.  Somehow, it still feels far more appropriate to hide
    his bicycle in the bushes and play the infuriating Wayne to Kweller's sheepish Kevin Arnold.  Maturity,
    then, is Kweller's shiny-haired Winnie Cooper: elusive, confounding, and perpetually out of reach.</p><p>
    
    Kweller's latest, <i>On My Way</i>, takes a gallant stab at adulthood, toning down the slappy bursts and
    over-energized slams, and simultaneously erasing all the awkward, bumbling charm (comparing sex to eating
    spaghetti?) that made us notice him in the first place.  Mostly, Kweller's very-well-intentioned efforts
    have simply led to an unfortunate critical snafu: Record reviewers have long chastised Kweller for his
    naivete, but those same folks will probably frown when faced with Kweller's loaded, listless shot at the
    big kids' table.  <i>On My Way</i> is a far less goofy effort than 2002's <i>Sha Sha</i>, and suffers
    remarkably for its comparable lack of inanity-- no longer powered by the youthful glee of his solo debut,
    Kweller's hooks sag and fade, contrived and loose.  Like countless twenty-somethings hovering on the cusp
    on self-realization, Kweller's grasps at actualization fall just a little bit short, inadvertently
    positioning his younger flailings as the far more attractive choice.</p><p>
    
    ""Hospital Bed"" sees Kweller returning to the depths of his well-pilfered Beatles collection, channeling the
    (irritatingly plucky) spirit of Bens cohort Ben Folds, mixing in twinkly piano bits and octave-jumping vocals;
    it's the closest Kweller comes to recreating <i>Sha Sha</i>'s cocky charisma, with hyperactive la-la-la's
    and pounding electric guitar.  Kweller's boyish vocals, which have always felt vaguely unhinged, work best
    when singing absurd, yelpy love songs to his stuff-- see his tender ode to his cat-filled Brooklyn apartment:
    ""My apartment/ The home where I hide/ Away from all the darkness outside/ I'm there all the time."" Kweller
    mixes in some sweet acoustic ballads (the title song is an unassuming acoustic monument to his girl: ""She
    makes hats with her hands/ She is such an artist/ I'm her biggest fan/ And I'm teaching her to sing""), but
    his folky promises are still far less convincing than his leg-flailing, adolescent rockers, like ""The Rules"".</p><p>
    
    Ben Kweller is clearly trying hard to do the right thing-- to grow up, brush off, evolve.  But <i>On My
    Way</i>-- as its title so brazenly suggests-- is also unforgivably transitory.  Subsequently, the record
    becomes an oddly limp testament to Kweller's newfound inertia, and listeners are left feeling a little
    empty-nested.</p></div>"|4553.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4553-on-my-way/|6.4|Amanda Petrusich

    years, as the genre's popularity exploded, it's undergone a major transformation, and these days, it's
    increasingly difficult to identify or label the style of every new low-budget collective.  Fortunately,
    the Sound Providers (aka Soulo and Jason Skills) lay out their agenda immediately: Their debut is an aural
    retrospective of the mid-90s, as well as a testament to the survival of the jazz-hop format.  Spiritually,
    it distills the magic of Digable Planets and Black Sheep into a modern, less ambitious format.</p><p>
    
    Though far from original, <i>An Evening with the Sound Providers</i> is notable for taking a bat to
    jazz-hop's dead horse while also paying its just dues.  Surprisingly, this unusual production style tends
    to work more frequently than not, but not without its share of problems: Despite impressively consistent
    drumwork (a noticeable nod to DJ Premier) and functional samples, the instrumentals fail to offer much
    variety, and lack the necessary change-ups to command a listener's full attention.  The duo also tend to
    lean toward a Ninja Tune-like background ambience, rather than the bolder sonics preferred by their
    forbears (Pete Rock, Diamond D, Prince Paul).</p><p>
    
    The few chosen MCs lack personality as well, drawing from the same pool of influences-- usually Guru,
    A Tribe Called Quest, and Black Thought.  Collectively, they seem to play the role of an inverted Slum
    Village: the jazzy beats remain, but in place of the sex-obsessed, pseudo-commercial dialogue is a series
    of conscious, anti-commercialist rhyme patterns to balance the scale.  Unfortunately, the rappers don't
    have much interesting to say, content to simply fill time when they appear on tracks.  More capable MCs--
    J-Live, maybe, or anyone from the Quannum collective-- would have been a much better match for the Sound
    Providers' production style.</p><p>
    
    There is, however, one untouchable bright flash, when Asheru of Unspoken Heard rises up to steal the show
    on ""For Old Time's Sake"".  Barreling around playful flute loops, light xylophone, upright bass, and harsh
    percussion, Asheru employs his clear monotone and slightly Posdnous-influenced delivery to take to the
    typical anti-platinum approach typical of this kind of record.  Still, his bile for MTV-friendly rappers is
    pretty amusing: ""Emcees these days got it all fucked up/ With their incredible quest to gain mad cream/

The only interview of his I've ever read was in     <i>ND Magazine</i>, featuring a photograph of a little shrew in lieu of a portrait of Jackman.  Active     in modern music since the early 1960s, Jackman took part in British composer Cornelius Cardew's crucial     Scratch Orchestra, which at various times has featured luminaries such as granddaddies of noise AMM,     composers Howard Skempton and Gavin Bryars, and the legendary Brian Eno.  Since then-- either under his     own name or under the more recognized moniker, Organum-- Jackman has released countless records that     exist on the peripheral edges of industrial and experimental music.  Whether on cassette, LP, or single,     these transmissions are usually cooked up in editions so miniscule that within weeks of their release     their average eBay price is greater than the number of extant copies.</p>
<p>As private as Jackman is, his list of collaborators reads like a who's who of experimental heavyweights:     Jim O'Rourke, Nurse with Wound's Steve Stapleton, Current 93's David Tibet, Main, Eddie Prevost, The     Haters, The New Blockaders, and Christoph Heemann have all had roles in his ongoing Organum project.     This new release stems from a 1999 dinner date between mutual acquaintances, at which Jackman handed     tapes over to prototypical sound pounder, Z'EV.  It's an apt pairing considering that Z'EV's ear-bleeding     early work laid the I-beams for folks like Einstürzende Neubauten and Test Dept.  (He also kept the     klangbeat on ""anvil"" for an early Glenn Branca symphony.)  Despite both men's love of muscular and metallic     drones, natural sound decay, and endless mechanistic churning (Jackman has released singles of machine gun     fire and tank engines), this new alliance leans more towards Organum's propensity toward maddening brevity.</p>
<p>As a result, <i>Tinnitus Vu</i> is four tracks long and clocks in just at 16 minutes.  Named after a garden     lunch discussion they had about each other's loss of hearing, initiate listeners might not quite understand     what they're hearing, either: In Jackman's oeuvre, sound sources are impossible to approximate.  A resounding     piano chord-- stretched and morphed beyond recognition-- introduces each shift in the drone.  Even with all     the manipulations, these suspended strings carry through the buzzing din.  The record's sleeve art, which     features an x-rayed boxspring on its cover and stretched-out coils strung along a snow-coated fence in the     countryside on its back, suggests these too could be the source of the drone.  As always with Organum, that     metal-scratched drone is dangerous, hypnotic, brutal, and beatific.  ""II"" creaks like a squeaky bed and a     wind-blasted ghost ship, while ""III"" glowers with menacing Vader-esque breathing until the ringing piano     returns.</p>
<p><i>Tinnitus Vu</i> is more widely available than most of Jackman's intriguing and defining work, much of     which has been released on smaller imprints such as Germany's Die Stadt, the U.S.'s Robot Records, the UK's     Matchless, and Japan's Siren Records.  But even if it's impossible to completely capture or collect all of     Jackman's output-- even the ones that feature his best work-- each of his droning soundsc(r)apes is still     a treat.</p></div>"|6094.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6094-tinnitus-vu/|6.9|Andy Beta

Since
    I didn't want his money, we set up a barter system: Every couple of weeks he handed over heavy bags of
    vegetables and various tofu products from the organic grocer where he worked.  It functioned well for both
    of us: He got the food for cost and I ate at home instead of walking to the sketchy Chinese restaurant down
    the street.  Moreover, we used his payment for meals that the entire household prepared together.</p><p>
    
    In retrospect, our method of reimbursement fit well with the politics of Man Is the Bastard, the sludgy
    Southern California noise-core band to which he so frequently stirred the pasta.  And though a cramped
    NYC apartment makes me wary of reintroducing these idyllic arrangements into my current living situation,
    if he did wander back looking for some floor-space and a mattress, perhaps we could listen to <i>The People
    at Large</i> while we pureed our rosemary and chickpeas.</p><p>
    
    Now presenting mellower fare, Henry Barnes, the voluminously bearded mystic behind Claremont, California's
    Amps for Christ, played guitar and prepared organ in Man Is the Bastard before founding AFC in 1997.  On
    his seventh album, the violence has been replaced with a few pinches of feedback and a whole lot of pretty
    sitar, wiry Fahey-esque plucking, gentle folk strums, ballads layered with crumbling distortion, and one
    instance of boom-box screamo.  Behind the stylistic maturation, though, the political grumbles remain.</p><p>
    
    Despite the misleading tones of his gentle whispers, Barnes takes Bush to task for the war in Iraq, critiques
    America's soulless greed, and offers a less than idealized version of 9/11.  Like any good punk, he also
    scrawls political manifestos-cum-poetry throughout the CD's liner notes: ""Don't look now George but a big
    snake's got you by the toe/ This time it's Muhammad sayin let my people go.""  And because Barnes is unabashedly
    passionate about his Christianity, these ""holy war"" disses offer an extra resonance.  Despite some proselytizing,
    like Sufjan Stevens or The Danielson Famile, Barnes doesn't come off pushy or self-righteous; rather, he
    just seems really confident and calm.</p><p>
    
    Wisely escaping the overwroughtness of a ham-fisted Propaghandi screamathon, Amps for Christ let the music
    do most of the pontificating.  While ""AFC Tower Song"" is fairly explicit in its subject matter, when Tara
    Tikitavi sings ""Prince Charlie Stuart,"" a traditional Scottish ballad popularized by Steeleye Span, there's
    a less obvious sense of the political couched in her anachronistic harmonizing of the Bonnie Prince's exile
    in Spain.  Placing interpretation squarely in the hands of the listener, the apocalyptic ""Firecube"" pumps
    out chirpy KK Null noise, while the blissful ""Freddie the Mockingbird"" is just chirpy.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps mirroring the vast populism of its title, <i>The People at Large</i> has the charm of an overstuffed
    antique jukebox stuck between 45s: I hear Iran fronting the Sun City Girls, Captain Beefheart collaborating
    with Merzbow, the old Shrimper band Goosewind trying some Appalachia.  The laid-back spoken poetry of ""Bug""
    hits like the ""fast and bulbous"" intro to ""Pachuco Cadaver"" on <i>Trout Mask Replica</i>.  ""Banjo Hymn""
    breaks hearts with its lovely sustain and eventual hoedown.  The stately minuet ""Midianite Prelude"" reminds
    me of the opening to an episode of <i>Masterpiece Theater</i>, though I've never actually watched the show.</p><p>
    
    This breadth is impressive (the record's twenty-three songs equals the track count of 2002's <i>The Oak
    in the Ashes</i>), but the continual shift between styles also highlights weaknesses.  For instance, the
    overstated ""Memmorial Immemorial (Revisited)"" and its ponderous soloing, left me yearning for the clean
    lines of an endless sitar, hinted at wonderfully on ""Tarsit"" and ""Claremont Raga"".  Still, Barnes continues
    to forge an engaging hodgepodge of musical/political/spiritual obsessions, and whatever the eventual pitfalls
    of this patchy eclecticism, finding a form within these shambles is an enjoyable task.</p></div>"|174.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/174-the-people-at-large/|7.4|Brandon Stosuy

    artificial songbirds Breezy Singers, will market The Dream Workshop, or ""Yumemi Kobo.""  The device looks
    like a cheap viewscreen attached to a baby monitor or shower radio.  For \xA514,800, users will (theoretically)
    be able to create and control their dreams.  After the sleeper inserts and ogles an image associated with
    the desired dream, the bedside contraption emits odors, soothing music, and voice recordings during deep
    REM sleep to steer the brain through the proper nocturnal narrative.</p><p>
    Having received a prototype of the toy for an article in <i>Cold Sweat</i>, the magazine of nightmares and
    nightmare culture, I decided to kill two birds with one stone and review The Dream Workshop and fifth
    Tortoise album, <i>It's All Around You</i>, together.  I followed the instructions, drank a bottle of wine,
    inserted the smooth atmospheric rambling of Tortoise into the sound drives, and went to bed.  In my dream,
    I threw a stone which ricocheted off the head of a Blue Jay, and into the soft breast plate of an American
    Goldfinch.  (One should not use the Breezy Singers songbird simulators with The Dream Workshop.)  On the
    second try, I scanned the fantastic artwork of <i>It's All Around You</i> into the Workshop's monitor and
    stared intently into the image.</p><p>
    Looking at the cover, I hoped to take a dip in the waterfall, cross the bridge by the rainbow, or wander
    down into the L.A. grid that glows like bioluminescent deep sea creatures.  Oliver Wasow's surreal,
    technicolor images of social decay, natural awe, and disaster begged to be experienced in a state of lucid
    dreaming.  In fact, even Tortoise themselves seem so overwhelmed by the majesty of the images that these
    10 songs sound more influenced by the digitally enhanced landscapes than some collective subconscious
    muse.  Clearly, the seasoned Chicago ambient jamband hopes to whisk listeners through these beautiful,
    unreal vistas.  Unfortunately, they just end up emulating the hi-glossed cardboard the scenes are printed
    on.</p><p>
    As I lay in bed, the album's opening title track gracefully lifted off with John McEntire's skittering
    helicopter-blade percussion and Doug McCombs' lightly turbulent bass.  Jeff Parker, Tortoise's most
    significant member, pointed to bushes and dawn-illuminated mist with his languid, soloing guitar, setting
    the mood for ""The Lithium Stiffs"".  Here, Kelly Hogan's vocals-- little more than Calgon ahh's processed
    through a keyboard-- perfectly emulated the state of relaxed awe.  It's the most emotional piece of music
    Tortoise have yet created, working the numbing psychotropia of the title against the joyous exaltations of
    Hogan's vertiginous sighs.  The bass deepened dramatically, mimicking the throb of an eardrum pulse cupped
    against a pillow.  But much as Hogan's vocals beckoned and hinted at audio bliss, they sadly dissipated,
    leaving the brain little to focus on but percussion, chimes and vibraphone, like your amplified heartbeat,
    or a dripping showerhead in the dead black night of your home.</p><p>
    ""Stretch (You Are All Right)"" naggingly fought The Dream Workshop for my attention in such a manner.  Here,
    after a promising start, Tortoise stubbornly began to adhere to their tested formula of studio-perfect
    skittering and vibraphone.  (Is there a more monotonous sounding instrument than vibraphones?  Even at
    their best they sound like florid doorbells.)  Finally, my brain gave in fully to slumber out of bored
    frustration.  <i>It's All Around You</i>, too, settled into REM sleep at that point.  Even the band's busy
    percussion on ""Dot/Eyes"", electronic glitch on ""By Dawn"", and, uh, more skittering percussion and glitch and
    vibraphone on ""Unknown"" and ""Five Too Many"" seemed as instinctual and unnoticeable as fluttering eyelids,
    letting the subconscious spend more valuable time in dreams or the decayed island city depicted inside of
    the digipak.  The titles alone struck me as profoundly insightful.  ""By Dawn""?  If I was lucky.  ""Five Too
    Many?""  Indeed.</p><p>
    Finally, by the concluding ""Salt the Skies"", Tortoise and The Dream Workshop synched up with effect, taking
    me into the rusty, charred landscape of the inset photograph.  Clouds gathered.  John McEntire quickened his
    drum hammering.  Oil lines exploded in flames.  Jeff Parker let feedback spill from his guitar.  And as
    the final chime ebbed with the darkness, I awoke.  The beginning of a dream, and its climax, always stick
    most to memory.  Tortoise, too, lure you in with nifty production tricks and winding melodies at the start
    of the album, and build to closing climaxes, just as they've done in the past on ""TNT"", ""Seneca"", and
    ""Speakeasy.""  It's the middling middles that have always bogged their albums.</p><p>
    More frustrating, however, is that, after the scrappy <i>Standards</i>, where Parker spiked the mix with
    sparks and grime, Tortoise have pressed their music back into Scandinavian furniture.  Cold Ikea percussion
    frames hold downy white duvets of keyboards, the music sterile and functional.  Looks lovely in the
    storefront window, but isn't quite comfortable for heavy petting or watching baseball.  Like Japanese
    toys-- The Dream Workshop, and the Furby and Tamagochi before it-- Tortoise obviously spend hours in the
    lab honing the science, but the finished product comes with a one-time novelty factor.  The most insipid
    reviews of instrumental music inevitably refer to the music as ""soundtracks to the best film never made!""
    Sadly, Tortoise have been outdone by the still photographs accompanying their music.</p></div>"|8117.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8117-its-all-around-you/|5.2|Brent DiCrescenzo

    exotic and strange.  Before Kraftwerk, and certainly ages before all manner of modern digitally powered pop,
    hip-hop and experimental music, the only people interested enough in electronics to apply them in anything
    approaching rock were mad-scientists like Raymond Scott, Bruce Haack and David Vorhaus.  These people were
    as much engineers as they were musicians, and history has granted them more technological props than musical
    ones.  However, as the futuristic daydreams of the 50s and 60s graduated into the wide-eyed discovery by
    thousands of young, fearless kids in the 70s, the ideal of electronic interaction with guitars and drums
    seemed less an abstract, distant concept than a viable alternate reality.</p><p>
    One of the earliest bands to exploit this marriage to its fullest potential was the French outfit Heldon,
    led by guitarist Richard Pinhas.  Pinhas was heavily influenced by King Crimson leader Robert Fripp--
    particularly his searing, sustained tone, coming on like an intensely focused acid-rock laser beam-- and
    a love of epic-length compositions.  Pinhas was also very much enthralled by the idea of using programmed
    synthesizers in his work.  His first records with Heldon are direct precursors to the industrial clang of
    bands like Throbbing Gristle, and later, Einstürzende Neubauten and Ministry, in their uses of menacing
    synth clusters performing seemingly endless patterns of perpetually churning, lysergic fuzz.  However, his
    major impact wasn't felt until he combined his love of King Crimson's avant-progressive dynamics with his
    fetish for doom-filled, minimalist tech-core.  The apexes of this fusion were represented on 1976's <i>Un
    Reve Sans Consequence Speciale</i> and this album, 1977's <i>Interface</i>.</p><p>
    Pinhas worked with two of the finest musicians of his country on <i>Interface</i>: keyboardist Patrick
    Gauthier (later of Magma), and powerhouse drummer Francois Auger.  With this pair, Pinhas was able to
    construct massive specimens of metronomic terror while still being able to constantly shift the focus of
    the sound.  In concert, they might stretch five-minute patterns into half-hour death races, never deviating
    from the pre-ordained settings of an army of sequenced synthesizers.  The classic Heldon lineup was like
    an inhuman mix of Tangerine Dream's otherworldly journeys into space and time and the finely tuned brawn
    of The Mahavishnu Orchestra, not to mention featuring practically orgasmic guitar solos that would make
    Makoto Kawabata blush.  It was excessive to a fault, but then, any music designed to draw out the darkest
    demons of an acid trip should've been.</p><p>
    The first side of the original LP consists of several relatively short pieces, each nonetheless in the
    immediately identifiable Heldon style.  Auger's ""Les Soucoupes Volantes Vertes"" and ""Bal-A-Fou"" both
    feature synth-ostinatos under which he pounds like Jaki Leibezeit on triple-dosage steroids.  The thick
    rumble of the latter tune almost makes you forget there was no bassist in the band.  Pinhas' ""Jet Girl""
    is fairly similar to his earlier Heldon efforts in that it forsakes typical rock aggression for bleak,
    apocalyptic soundscapes more often identified with the industrial music that was inspired, in part, by
    this band.  Nevertheless, Pinhas' distant, raging guitar serves fair warning that this music originates
    from the same psychedelic heart as many other concurrent night-trippers like Ash Ra Tempel and Hawkwind,
    even if the execution was completely different.</p><p>
    The meat of <i>Interface</i> is its 18-minute title track (also featured in two truncated live versions on
    this Cuneiform reissue).  Beginning with phased, metallic hammering, morphing into a percussive pattern
    and eventually traveling through a truly intimidating labyrinth of synthesizers, howling guitars and
    all-around horrific, swirling thunder, ""Interface"" is the definitive avant-prog nightmare.  With each
    passing minute, it seems more detail is layered into the piece, so that before too long, there's so much
    going on, I can only really make out a single, lurching beast.  Rattlesnake electric drums going off on
    the right, bass-heavy synthlines threatening to throw me off balance, Auger's constantly mutating drum
    patterns-- but most of all, Pinhas' absolutely unhinged soloing.  He starts out merely deranged, bending
    lines all over the place, like a strung-out Hendrix taking his wrath upon Silicon Valley.  His lines
    eventually transform into almost pure noise, jumping up just long enough for you to notice that your
    speakers are about to blow from all the commotion below.  It really is an obscene mess, but still a
    gorgeous one.</p><p>
    This CD is the same issue that Cuneiform released a few years back, but which had gone out of print almost
    as soon.  Anyone with even a passing interest in electronic/rock hybrid music should check it out, as well
    as those wanting to hear one of the chief precedents for bands ranging from Lightning Bolt to Neurosis to
    Squarepusher.  To many (including me), Heldon and Richard Pinhas are considered building blocks for whole
    schools of experimental rock music, and one of the few who rarely fail to deliver on the hype.</p></div>"|3979.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3979-interface/|8.7|Dominique Leone

    ""porn soundtrack"" are often put to use.  The idea that the blue movies of the 70s had even marginally
    interesting soundtracks is, if you think about it, a rather odd bit of received wisdom.  How many people
    have actually seen enough of these films to say?  Perhaps it's just that 70s porn soundtracks and the
    now-classic music of the blaxploitation genre have become tangled up in people's minds somehow.</p><p>
    In 1975, Swedish songwriter and renaissance man Tom Zacharias recorded two concept albums so funky, so nasty,
    and in such overall bad taste, that counterpart skin flicks would've been mere redundancies.  These records,
    titled <i>Belinda</i> and <i>Belinda's Döttir</i>, featured elastic rhythms, acid guitars, and catchy pop
    songs about kinky sex of the most extreme varieties.  Sold primarily in porn shops, both were hits throughout
    Sweden.  In an attempt to cross over to the American market, Zacharias recruited singers to add English
    vocals to a handful of the tunes and advertised the finished product via classifieds in the back pages of
    <i>Hustler</i> and <i>Screw</i> magazines. There were few takers, however, and <i>Belinda</i> never arrived
    in America.</p><p>
    This CD reissue collects the <i>Belinda</i> songs re-recorded in English; also aboard are the Swedish
    originals.  The sound of this disc is immediately appealing.  Zacharias had access to a good studio and
    used top-drawer session musicians; every last instrument and piece of gear used here would undoubtedly
    fetch top dollar in today's vintage market.  The grizzled guitar filth is so very right, and the drums
    pop and reverberate with joy-- a joy the 80s might've destroyed forever.  When Zacharias' band is at its
    funkiest, it makes the kind of sound The Beastie Boys longed so desperately to capture on their <i>Check
    Your Head</i>-era instrumentals.  At the purely sonic level, <i>Belinda</i> is a major treat.</p><p>
    The songs themselves, though, present a mixed bag.  I greatly prefer the Swedish versions because, in
    English, the lyrics are graphic and shocking in the most juvenile manner possible, distracting the listener
    from all other concerns.  ""Please Daddy"" is sung from the perspective of a girl who wants to lay her father,
    and she's willing to allow Mom to join in.  ""Last Christmas,"" she sings, ""I blew Santa Claus/ And the family
    that screws together grooves together.""  Another lyric offhandedly mentions sex with a 10-year-old.  It's
    all theatrical and tongue-in-cheek, of course, but it's hard not to feel like an asshole listening to it.</p><p>
    But skip to the Swedish half of the album, and the groove goes guiltless in comparison.  With the meaning of
    the words masked, <i>Belinda</i> becomes an enjoyable series of libidinous 70s pop tunes with tough beats.
    ""Savinnan"" sounds almost like Can, with a driving bass throb that the rubbery drummer clings to like a life
    preserver.  ""Gay Club"" is acoustic and quieter but still danceable, stemming from some strain of music-hall
    tradition.  Melodies seem drawn more from Northern European folk songs than the Western pop tradition, which
    lends an added degree of strangeness.  This is not a great record by any means, but stick with <i>Belinda</i>'s
    Swedish versions and you've got a pretty decent record for a rather indecent party.</p></div>"|8957.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8957-belinda/|6.1|Mark Richardson

    session courtesy of his pregnant mother.  Funk has since revisited his sonic initiation in the womb with the
    eponymous Nymphomatriarch release, sourced entirely from mid-coitus, ""internal"" samples of he and partner
    Rachael Kozak (aka Hecate).  That he describes himself as a combination of Lee Perry, Stockhausen, and
    contemporary drum-n-bass pioneer Squarepusher-- all subject to ""gasoline enemas""-- may seem both egocentric
    and anally preoccupied enough to encourage further Freudian character analysis.</p><p>
    But however (un)justified you judge his self-opinion to be, Funk is currently producing some of the most
    challenging compositions on electronica veteran Mike ""\xB5-Ziq"" Paradinas' Planet Mu label.  His frantic
    production schedule has seen him messily hemorrhaging at least two full-lengths of chaotic, genre-devouring
    work each year-- with the emphasis often on shock and sensation.  And this year's <i>The Chocolate Wheelchair
    Album</i> won't likely disappoint his audience, containing variations on the crazy-paving soundscapes with
    which Funk has become synonymous.  But: Does it suggest enough of a progression to substantiate Funk's lofty
    allusions to the pioneers mentioned above?</p><p>
    Rumor has it that Funk's original title for this album was <i>The Stupid Chocolate Wheelchair Album</i>,
    an idea quashed by a disapproving Paradinas.  That didn't stop Funk taking a black marker to pre-release
    copies distributed at promotional gigs last year and ""correcting"" the tamed album title.  You see, Funk
    does whatever the hell he wants-- a philosophy that thrives unchecked in the studio.  Ever since the
    gorgeous fusion of opera, eruptive break beats, and a cappella melodic phrasing on ""Dance Like You're
    Selling Nails"" (from 2002's <i>Higgins Ultra Low Track Glue Funk Hits 1972-2006</i>), Venetian Snares has
    deserved some indulgence of his attention-seeking musical tendencies.  And if this album fails to capture
    the originality of his best work, it at least captures a similar spirit.</p><p>
    ""Einstein-Rosen Bridge"" vibrates with funky guitars channeled into revisionist techno mockery set to
    trademark hectic beats.  The overall effect is surging and rampant; Funk camps it up with throwaway vocal
    samples and something akin to game-show style orchestral hits.  This track obliterates the immediately
    forgettable glitch noodling of ""Langside"", a piece made obsolete by Funk's own superior past efforts in
    this area.  ""Handthrow"" starts out, worryingly enough, like an early jungle track, merely accelerated and
    panned about with nothing resembling innovation; its distortion-happy, shoot-'em-up descent into monotonous
    snare button-hammering isn't much better, either.</p><p>
    Despite <i>The Chocolate Wheelchair Album</i>'s intriguingly perverse wackiness, a weakness begins to emerge
    as it plays.  Funk has always flitted between styles, making each track a microcosm of multiple genres.
    The riotous pastiche that has served Funk so well in the past here threatens to deaden one's senses to the
    individual moments of inspiration.  When psychotic mood swings and jaw-dropping reversals are this ubiquitous,
    they lose their ability to shock, and, criminally, they almost lull.  Funk packs so much processed pandemonium
    into each song that you can't help thinking that a dozen or more of those rapid-fire ideas could have been
    set aside and nurtured over their own four minutes.</p><p>
    Still, even within this dense barrage of skewered noise, there lies a handful of intriguing moments to snap
    listeners to attention: Standout tracks ""Herbie Goes Ballistic"" and ""Marty's Tardis""-- the latter featuring
    an affectionate reworking of the <i>Doctor Who</i> theme-- see ideas and form presented in equal measure.
    And if nothing else, the record is more accessible than 2001's boisterous <i>Songs About My Cat</i>.  Of
    course, none of this changes that notion that Funk is suffering the plight of many an electronic composer--
    a limitless availability of sonic tools and the fetishistic desire to push each one to the limit.  Like an
    electronic magpie, Funk surrounds himself with all that glisters.  Thankfully, half the time he produces
    gold.</p></div>"|8441.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8441-the-chocolate-wheelchair-album/|6.5|Dan Lett

    Catherine Ann Irwin and Janet Beveridge Bean, Freakwater was renowned for its strict adherence to bare-bones
    Appalachian musical forms.  Their first couple of releases helped jumpstart the alt-country movement in the
    early 90s, boasting little more than the cheaply recorded acoustic guitars and vocal harmonies of the two
    frontwomen, augmented by sparing use of stand-up bass, pedal steel, dobro, and other stylistically
    appropriate instruments.  But this stark, almost severe attention to form was not merely an academic
    exercise.  There was a bucket-load of heart-wrenching humanity there, too.</p><p>
    
    A lot of that is due to Irwin herself.  Other performers have mined this uber-authentic vein from a certain
    distance, gingerly handling traditional themes (salvation, drunkenness, poverty) and song-structures like
    sacred library texts to be presented as if under glass.  By contrast, Irwin comes across as the genuine
    article-- a musically homely, inexpert oddball, the updated embodiment of the tragic eccentrics that have
    always populated this kind of musical landscape.  It never sounds like she had to study how to sing or
    write this way.  Her songs and her singing sound convincingly lived-in.</p><p>
    
    Also contributing to the human factor is the car-wreck compelling, between-the-lines story that is related
    solely through the interplay of the two women's voices.  Countless other long-standing vocal duos have rung
    the harmony bell with more crystalline clarity, but few have wrestled so explicitly to define a real-world
    relationship in song.  This subtext allows Bean and Irwin to transcend their vocal limitations and gives
    the music an emotional, in-the-room immediacy that is simply not available to more accomplished practitioners.</p><p>
<i>Old Paint</i>, originally released in 1996, was Freakwater's high-water mark as a going concern.  For
    the second time, it paired them with madwoman-in-the-attic production specialist Brad Wood, who was still
    basking in the afterglow of his work with Liz Phair.  Bassist Dave Gay was now permanently on board as the
    third band member, and steel player Bob Egan, who would later spend some time in Jeff Tweedy's revolving
    door, was on hand to provide the color commentary.  Bean and Irwin were more than ready, with an album's
    worth of supremely evocative original songs-- for the first time, the few, well-chosen covers on a
    Freakwater album were there to lend context to the original songs, and not the other way around.</p><p>
    
    The first lines of <i>Old Paint</i>'s opening ""Gravity"" announce Freakwater's worldview quite clearly: ""I
    wasn't drinking to forget/ I was drinking to remember/ How I once might have looked through the eyes of a
    stranger.""  A couple of songs later, on ""Gone to Stay"", things have only gotten worse, as Irwin sings,
    mournful but clear-eyed, ""There's nothing so sure as a razor blade above your wrist.""  By ""Hero/Heroine"",
    the situation is downright hopeless, with some nasty Stones-ish slide work and bleary observations like,
    ""Everyone who gets drunk will not write a good book.""  There are some moments of redemption as well, from
    the jet-black humor that propels the buoyant ""Waitress Song"" to the heavenly cello that levitates the
    haunting cover of Loudon Wainwright's ""Out of This World"".</p><p>
    
    So much discussion about bands like Freakwater hinges on questions of authenticity.  As <i>Old Paint</i>
    demonstrates, that's pretty much missing the point.  Specific styles of music are important, of course,
    because they carry certain traditions across generational lines.  But on a personal level, they're really
    just empty vehicles.  No musician can get anything of substance from a particular musical style-- it's what
    the musicians bring of themselves that matters.  On <i>Old Paint</i>, Bean and Irwin gave so generously of
    themselves that style and substance became virtually indistinguishable, and that's an achievement worth
    drinking to remember.</p></div>"|3184.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3184-old-paint/|8.5|Philip Shelley

    on the beatmaker's personality.  In the case of Blockhead and Def Jux emcee Aesop Rock, their names were
    seemingly attached to each other's achievements almost immediately.  But it was inevitable, considering
    Aesop's affinity for production, that Blockhead would take a stab at the instrumental game with his debut
    album for Ninja Tune, <i>Music by Cavelight</i>.</p><p>
    
    Far from experimental, Blockhead is a new breed of hard-edge traditionalist with few frills and a serious
    ear for samples.  His rhyme-ready work is high-strung and bombastic, but, as is the custom with most indie
    producers, his instrumental work is darker and more placid by comparison.  The album is rife with a variety
    of harrowing loops, as evidenced by the addictive, cleverly chopped guitar and layered strings of ""Road
    Rage Breakdown"" and the ebbing waves of bass, emotional piano, and orchestral arrangements on the stomping
    ""Insomniac Olympics"".  One thing you'll notice, though, is a lack of pacing within each composition, as
    well as a general dearth of tonal variance throughout the span of the record.</p><p>
    
    Anyone who has followed Blockhead's career would most likely attest to, one major factor of production as
    his Achilles' heel: the drums.  And while it is true that some of his earlier work (and the odd track on
    this album) was prone to a seriously poor choice of drum set, nothing bothers me more in his beats than
    the bass.  The basslines themselves aren't bad at all, but the sounds associated with them are incredibly
    distracting in the full scheme of things.  Couple that with the fact that his use of pitchshifted vocal
    samples (a la Kanye West or Just Blaze) is awkwardly jarring, and you begin to see a lot of missed
    potential.</p><p>
    
    But in the case of ""You've Got Maelstrom"", the sound works for the better.  Opening with harmlessly faint
    keys and bongos, this track leaves the listener ill-prepared for its onslaught of scratches, a seemingly
    Elizabethan xylophone melody, and a sharp synthline.  Soon, a saxophone is introduced, followed by a splash
    of flute that gets cut by timely vocal samples and crushed by Miami bass drums, horns, and tortured yelps.
    It doesn't have the emotional resonance harnessed by more time-tested instrumental compilers in the
    underground, but it's incredibly listenable nonetheless.</p><p>
    
    All around, Blockhead's first foray into solo sound collage is far from bad, but it rarely steals the show
    the way his rapper-associated work tends to.  Then again, maybe this was his intention: to release a nuanced,
    traditional production clinic that has more in common with trip-hop and chillout than pure hip-hop grandiosity.
    Either way, even without the experimentation of Rjd2 or the upbeat nature of his better known work, there is
    definitely a place for the calm tones of Blockhead's debut.</p></div>"|1104.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1104-music-by-cavelight/|6.5|Rollie Pemberton

    asked Black Dice vocalist-turned-knobtwister Eric Copeland what he thought of his band's place in modern
    noise's renaissance, as well as its knowledge of that genre's past.  ""I feel like there <i>is</i> an
    underground that is really aware of this stuff,"" he said.  ""We're a little bit behind-- like we're catching
    up-- but it's kinda nice being ignorant of it.  When we approach these ideas, they always feel new to us,
    even if they may not always sound new.""  Ignorance is bliss: Just ask the roomful of monkeys at typewriters
    getting to the ear-poisoning monologue of <i>Hamlet</i>.</p><p>
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive to simply say that <i>Miles of Smiles</i>-- Black Dice's
    contribution to a Tokyo gallery's Poetry of Sex installation, and the A-side to the band's latest 12-inch--
    accidentally re-creates the ""Music Promenade"" section of French composer Luc Ferrari's 30-year-old landmark
    tape composition, <i>Presque Rien</i>.  Both pieces utilize the field-recorded rhythms of a marching band's
    celebratory processional to swim between worlds alternately mundane and nightmarish-- the aural hallucinations
    running hot and cold-- but that's where the synchronicity ends.</p><p>
    A blanket of bugs chirps at the start of the track and echoes throughout, and an egg rattle continually
    pans about as if stolen from Ragnar Grippe's minimal classic, <i>Sand</i>.  Along with quoting records
    they've probably never heard, Black Dice flash a heavy amount of Krautrock tape foolery, taking cues from
    the meth/'luude interludes of <i>Neu! 2</i> and echoing the mix of handheld percussion and endless reverberation
    of Can's kooky ""Ethnological Forgery Series"".  Not content to just dissolve all this history into an ambient
    puddle, the track's frantic marching band brass section stomps double time for its giddy finale.</p><p>
    The second half of the EP, ""Trip Dude Delay"", is a final postcard from the edges of Black Dice's familiar,
    expansive <i>Beaches and Canyons</i> sound.  Having parted ways with drummer Hisham Bharoocha, Black Dice
    will no longer have his thunderous toms, crashing cymbals, and tribal rhythms to tether their drifts.
    ""Trip Dude Delay"" has opened Black Dice's live set for roughly two years, and it sounds as if Bjorn Copeland's
    guitar is a thousand twanging instruments.  Sometimes the vocals sound ready to shuffle off this mortal coil,
    as if the Beach Boys' ""Our Prayer"" had been cut at Lee Perry's Black Ark.  All are subsumed by Bharoocha's
    malleted cymbal, swelling into a nasty tempest.  The captured cymbal frequencies scald at white-noise
    temperatures and the sub-woofers seep out lava, but it all retains a fine quintessence of dust and pumice.</p><p>
    As oceanic as the middle section is-- overwhelming the senses in its unbridled noise-- its enormous natural
    forces and minute details remain intact, each droplet discerned in the tidal wave.  As it cools, it reveals
    an isle full of noises, sounds, and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not.  It lounges like Martin Denny's
    tiki hut, a place where tropical thumb pianos coo with the washed-out vocal harmonies, serenely slurping
    back out to sea after nearly 15 minutes out of joint.  Less musique concrète than a chunk of asphalt,
    <i>Miles of Smiles</i> moves in a delirious stagger.  Eyes heavy lidded, flaunting ragged edges and torn
    cuffs, it revels in brave new worlds, even if those worlds are only new to them.</p></div>"|750.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/750-miles-of-smiles-ep/|7.9|Andy Beta

In a paragraph or two, I may spoil the hell out of it.</p><p>
    
    Given its subject matter, Michel Gondry's new film, <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i>, has a
    particularly visual agenda, which makes great use of the medium's most important quality: its ability
    to collapse the distinction between linear and synchronic plot development.  Charlie Kaufman has essentially
    written a film's film, which is fine-- wonderful, in fact-- but what storytelling role does <i>Eternal
    Sunshine</i> leave, then, for its soundtrack?</p><p>
    
    The answer here is not much of one.  Jon Brion has written a perfectly ambient score: It's undistracting,
    yet contains interesting sounds and ideas for those who choose to be distracted by it.  But with this
    balance comes a powerful dependence on <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>'s visual elements.  The value of listening
    to Brion's score by itself-- with the exception of his thematically tongue-in-cheek ""Strings That Tie to
    You""-- is situated in the potency of its corresponding visual nostalgia.  This seems to be the logical fate
    of most film scores, but in the case of <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>, Brion's insistence on certain themes
    popping in and out of his textures seems particularly appropriate, as the soundtrack's fluid matrix
    performatizes the cinematography's mind/body collapse:  In the film, Brion's organi-synthgaze postlude
    ""Phone Calls"" plays after Joel decides not to try and save his first memory of Clementine, but just to
    enjoy it.  Here, Brion's score meets <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>'s oculophilia halfway, and fittingly comprises
    one of the film's most potent scenes.</p><p>
    
    By now I trust you've seen the trailers for <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>, and yes, the song that backs it
    (Electric Light Orchestra's ""Mr. Blue Sky"") is present here, despite not finding time in the film itself.
    The Polyphonic Spree also contribute two heavy doses of equally sugary pop (""Light and Day"" and ""It's
    the Sun""), while Anaheim garage trio The Willowz offer two shameless, anonymous, but ultimately tolerable
    White Stripes rip-offs.  Also present is Lata Mangeshkar's Indian spook ""Wada Na Tod"", which plays from
    the kitchen radio in Clementine's apartment in a moment of comic self-indictment: Clementine works at
    Barnes &amp; Noble, which these days seems to pride itself on its peddling of ""world"" music releases.  The
    song title means ""Don't break your promise,"" and subtly hints at Clementine's final request of Joel-- that
    he meet her again.</p><p>
    
    And then there's the Beck track, a cover of The Korgis' ""Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometime"".  Scott Plagenhoef
    panned this track in a recent <a href=""http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/wearetheworld/04-03-24.shtml""><u>We
    Are The World review</u></a>, but I think Beck did a really fine job reworking the original, and here's
    why: The song appears at three critical junctures in <i>Eternal Sunshine</i> when Joel feels trapped
    by the bitterly ironic circumstances of his memory erasure.  Beck's cover logically cannot encompass
    ""love's multiple dimensions"" in the same way as the original version, as it would make for an odd
    juxtaposition: From Joel's perspective, love has only one side, its unrequitedness and devastation.
    In these moments, love is hardly ""a journey always worth taking.""</p><p>
    
    Fittingly, Beck revoices all the chords to be decidedly less bright and colorful, and with this move, he
    changes the tone of the song's repetitive lyrics from their originally bittersweet positivity to a perfectly
    contradictory melancholy.  When Beck sings, ""Change your heart,"" we know very well that Joel does not have
    the power to change his own.  This is the song's beautiful ironic tension, which is used to fantastic effect
    in the movie's final scene: Joel and Clementine's mutual emotional attraction ultimately gives way to
    reason.  It's triumph of reason over human emotion, summed up perfectly by their laughter-- Gondry's final
    nod to Nietzsche, who said (roughly) that laughter signifies the death of an emotion.  Beck's song starts
    here again: Joel and Clementine have finally learned, and what they've learned comprises the film's
    disarmingly icy pessimism.</p></div>"|7890.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7890-eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind/|7.5|Nick Sylvester

    unique and recognizable sound from the most basic elements of rock music.  By the time they'd released
    their second album, <i>The Lonesome Crowded West</i>, the band was working with a distinct but manipulable
    set of characteristic traits-- Isaac Brock's throaty, lisping vocals, Eric Judy's rolling, fluid basslines,
    and the rigid, muscular drumming of Jeremiah Green.  2000's <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i> crafted these
    traits into an epic studio masterpiece-- an ambitious, affecting, moody album that built upon the band's
    musical strengths rather than obfuscating them.  But in the wake of that record, the band's future seemed
    dubious.  Under the pressure of following their defining LP, the band lost their drummer and regained
    original guitarist Dan Gallucci, a substantial lineup shift that seemed to constitute a threat to the very
    core of Modest Mouse's characteristic sound.</p><p>
    In the wake of all this uncertainty, it comes as no small relief that <i>Good News for People Who Love Bad
    News</i> is just the kind of Modest Mouse record we've come to expect from the band. As suggested by the familiar starburst pattern on the CD, now stained a pharmaceutical pink, <em>Good News</em> is less a product of the ambitious experimentation of <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i> than it is the young, violent Modest Mouse on anti-depressants.  Opener ""The World at Large"" is classic Modest Mouse in composition-- Isaac Brock
    singing a melody of thirds over subtle chord changes and clean, delay-soaked electric guitar.  But the overall
    tone of the song is disarmingly anesthetic: The jabbing guitars and insistent drumming of early Modest
    Mouse are ostensibly absent, replaced with subtle e-bowed guitars and distant ""bop bop bop's.""  Certainly,
    ""The World at Large"" is more resigned in tone and content than any Modest Mouse song to date, but what
    makes it truly striking is that its resignation never seems fully convincing -- the frantic anxiety of early Modest Mouse still lurks just below the surface.</p><p>
    ""The World at Large"" is followed by the first single from <i>Good News</i>, the awe-inspiring ""Float On"".
    Like <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i>'s ""Paper Thin Walls"", this song seems fundamentally different from almost
    everything Modest Mouse has released to date.  In the past, even the band's upbeat songs have essentially
    been sped-up dirges, due in no small part to former drummer Jeremiah Green's restless, serpentine drum
    patterns.  On ""Float On"", new drummer Benjamin Weikel more than pulls his weight, his simple but inventive
    playing affording the song an anthemic character never before realized by the band.  This anthemic side of
    ""Float On"" reaches its apex in the song's fist-pumping finale, as numerous voices join in to sing/speak
    the chorus.</p><p>
    Like every other Modest Mouse full-length, <i>Good News</i> remains tremendously strong for its first five
    or six tracks.  ""Ocean Breathes Salty"" is slightly darker than ""Float On"", but remains uncharacteristically
    upbeat.  Here, Weikel's drumming proves particularly indispensable, his tight, regular playing adding extra
    emphasis to the song's powerful dynamics changes.  Lyrically, as with most resignation-themed albums by
    philosophically minded bands, <i>Good News</i> concerns itself largely with death and the afterlife.  At
    times, Brock's lyrics threaten to approach cliché, but ""Ocean Breathes Salty"" redeems itself with its strong
    vocal melodies and convincing delivery.  ""Bury Me With It"", the record's most blistering, forceful track, is
    an energetic high point, putting Brock's signature sing-screaming to great use.</p><p>
    With ""Dance Hall"", however, <i>Good News</i> begins to slip.  Along with ""The Devil's Workday"" and a few
    others, the song comes across as half-hearted Tom Waits pastiche, overlooking all of the band's strengths
    and ultimately undermining the album's cohesiveness.  It's a shame that so many of the album's darker tracks,
    which could have provided a poignant emotional counterpart to the more resigned and optimistic tone of the
    record as a whole, come across as so overdetermined and musically lacking.</p><p>
    Fortunately, <i>Good News</i> bounces back fast with the laidback, literate ""Bukowski"".  Here, as with
    ""The World at Large"", Brock steps out of his well-cultivated gas station savant pose to prove that, yes,
    he can read.  Indeed, <i>Good News</i> is a much more lyrically casual and upfront album than any past
    Modest Mouse record, substituting more conversational and direct observations for Brock's usual wide-eyed,
    poetic revelations.  Similarly, songs like ""Bukowski"" are much more musically unassuming, relying upon
    simple but well-structured banjo figures and rhythmic vocal patterns.</p><p>
    The latter part of <i>Good News</i> is host to some remarkable moments, as well.  ""Blame It on the Tetons""
    splits the difference between ""Bukowski"" and ""The World at Large"", offering one of the album's most memorable
    melodies.  On ""Black Cadillacs"", Modest Mouse wind up sounding uncannily like The Clash, Brock's chorus of
    ""we were done, done, done with all the fuck, fuck, fucking around"" echoed by angular stabs of guitar, bass,
    and drums.</p><p>
    Yet, for all its transcendent moments, <i>Good News</i> ultimately fails to hold together all that well as
    an album.  The middle sections of <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i>, often criticized for being aimless and
    overproduced, worked tremendously well towards reinforcing the desolate, paranoid tone of the record as a
    whole.  Indeed, <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i> was an album where moment-to-moment action was often, and
    wisely, sacrificed for album-unifying ambience.  On <i>Good News</i>, however, the lulls are simply lulls.</p><p>
    Still, it's remarkable that, after four long full-lengths, an album's worth of singles, and a couple of
    EPs, Modest Mouse are still finding ways to invigorate their sound while retaining a sense of definiteness
    and sincerity.  While <i>Good News</i> is neither a unilateral return to the scruffier Modest Mouse of
    yore, or an even more experimental expansion of <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i>, it is host to more than its
    share of great-- and, perhaps more importantly, distinctively great-- moments.  In spite of a substantial
    line-up change and the daunting spectre of their previous full-length, Modest Mouse have issued yet another
    record that uniquely explores what the band does best; being Modest Mouse.</p></div>"|5363.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5363-good-news-for-people-who-love-bad-news/|7.9|Matt LeMay

    years old and already writing sharper tunes than, well, most girls her age who write pop songs.  Then there's
    that 1950s-era kitsch cover photo of McKay wearing an adorable red coat that matches her lipstick, and
    orchestral arrangements that circle her piano with sweet pippy strings and flute tweets.  She swoons, she
    yells, and she even raps, though that's not as bad as when she cops an accent like Astrud Gilberto's.  And
    when the lyrics get political and she tut-tuts George W. Bush... <i>man</i>, this record's annoying.</p><p>
    
    But McKay is also great because she's cute.  She sings about her kitty and she even acts like one herself,
    baring her claws because she can pretend she doesn't know how to use them.  Every potentially annoying turn
    of phrase is like a secret ingredient that drives her songs into your skull.  For example, she doesn't sing
    about a clone-- it's a clon<em>ie</em>. And how retro is it to use a fizzy sound effect when she sings about
    pouring a drink?</p><p>
    
    McKay's the latest in the recent wave of NPR-friendly young women who like to sing with their clothes on.
    If you consider Norah Jones to be the leader of this pack and Joss Stone the one who just plain works the
    hardest, then that makes McKay the maverick.  Clever enough to flit across a broad pastiche instead of
    coasting by on jazz ballads, McKay can also be just edgy enough-- she swears but she's no sailor-- and she
    throws out barbs more to disrupt herself than her audience.</p><p>
    
    Take the lyrics, which are both shallow and unfathomable.  When other teens are singing about boys, McKay
    only seems to know men in their 40s, ones who spend more time lecturing her about jazz than breaking her
    heart.  McKay also has plenty of bile for the ladies, making fun of suburban housewives even while she acts
    scared that she'll become one.  Either way, a line like, "" I want to get married/ That's why I was born,""
    is the kind of teenage smarm that you get from people who are too young to make those mistakes.</p><p>
    
    ""Won't U Please B Nice"" is a flawless satire of a money-hungry wife-cum-femme-fatale-- until the bridge
    makes a distracting (and outdated) N'Sync joke.  And in case you were lulled by the closing ballad, ""Really"",
    she breaks the mood with a snap about a ""yuppie fuck.""  The only time it sounds like something is at stake
    is when she finally turns the bile on herself, like the self-doubt in ""Sari""-- on which she's spitting mad
    at herself and the world-- or ""Change the World"", where she's honest about how trivial life's big questions
    sound when they're filtered through teenage white guilt.  When she sings, ""Am I hetero or queer?"", it isn't
    t.A.T.u.-like tantalization, but idle speculation.</p><p>
    
    If McKay can't make up her mind about herself, that also suits the music, which is a mess of jazz, pop, and
    easy listening.  At their most obvious, the arrangements sound like a 1970s variety show, and you can picture
    a fiddler on a hoe-down set for ""It's a Pose"", or a cardboard NYC skyline wheeled out for ""Manhattan Avenue"".
    But under all of that, McKay brings the goods.  Her graceful melodies, barbed hooks, and confident voice
    take command on the itchingly catchy ""Ding Dong"" and ""The Suitcase Song"", on which she proves how smoothly
    she can tickle the ivory, what a warm massage her vocals can become, and how seductive she might someday
    sound.</p><p>
    
    With better lyrics and a longer attention span, McKay would be a jaw-dropping songwriter, but it's difficult
    to get sucked into a song if you don't connect with the singer.  McKay can't decide whether she'll grow up
    to be Dorothy Parker or Holly Golightly, and by splitting the difference, she only catches the funny parts
    of either.  Next time she'll need to give us more depth, to sustain us when the cute wears off.</p></div>"|5582.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5582-get-away-from-me/|6.3|Chris Dahlen

    the same kind of greasy, crooked fingerprints that lend other, non-computerized genres a sense of humanity.
    But Hrishikesh Hirway, the lone face behind the electric-bedroom swansongs of The One AM Radio, is
    perfectly poised to prove the opposite true, twisting and pulling his beats and effects until they burn
    like fingernails.  Folding soft, singer/songwriter laments into fuzzy washes of constructed sound, <i>A
    Name Writ in Water</i>, The One AM Radio's second full-length, is a collection of swooning folk songs,
    just sweet and compelling enough to make your well-worn Nick Drake tapes feel curiously obsolete.  And
    while they may not be as gory as a seven-minute guitar solo, Hirway's tracks still dripping with loads of
    gooey heart.</p><p>
    Since teaming with violinist Jane Yakowitz in 1999, Hirway has gradually delved deeper and deeper into
    folktronica nuance, rolling out subtle, beat-tinged poems and spare, instrumental elegies.  Most of <i>A
    Name Writ in Water</i> trades in blurry transitions: The stunning opener, ""What You Gave Away"", starts
    with gently shaken percussion as Hirway's soft vocals give way to a fleeting violin wail and quivering
    maracas falling into puttering beats.  Hirway's coos slip into computerized warbles, and a plaintive
    trumpet finally overtakes the melody, ending in a haze of sharp, sad yowls.  Standout ""Shivers"" opens
    with glitchy drones and woozy violins, its emotional narrative only stronger for its lack of vocals.
    ""Buried Below"", though, is defiantly straightforward, its light acoustic strums and nervous drums backing
    Hirway's multi-tracked, melancholic pledges.</p><p>
    Hirway's lyrics can occasionally seem convoluted (""Streetlights spark to life as we pass by/ Caught in
    panes of warehouse windows and reflecting in your eyes/ Lying on your lawn on our sides/ We'll stay
    outside""), and are generally preoccupied with standard issues of movement, life, death, loss and love.
    But Hirway's prose is also peppered with imagistic bits of landscape, all grass and dust and summer sunsets.
    Coupled with his breathy, organic whispers, much of <i>A Name Writ in Water</i> invites big, natural metaphors,
    somehow only easily comparable to snow-capped mountain ranges or towering, Sigur Rós-ian icecaps.  His
    compositions simply feel colossal.</p><p>
    Unsurprisingly, <i>A Name Writ in Water</i> is stubbornly unassuming in its prettiness, inadvertently
    figuring songs as portraits, melodies as promises.  While not nearly as pert or quirky as The Postal
    Service's like-minded debut, The One AM Radio is just as addictive-- but Hirway's version of America
    is less concerned with enigmatically assassinated presidents, and more interested in charting the gray
    spots between highways and oceans, between guitars and laptops.  The maps he draws are beautiful.</p></div>"|6093.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6093-a-name-writ-in-water/|8.1|Amanda Petrusich

One need only take a cursory glance at the Fredericksburg, Virginia-based
    trio's latest album, <i>Synthstatic</i>, and its hallucinogenic pink and blue artwork, or pull up the
    band's website at killerrockandroll.com to infer what their music sounds like and where they get their
    kicks.  Like many of the best rock bands around today, Skywave have hardly an original lick in them.  But
    anyone who listens to The Strokes for their inventiveness or risk-taking is missing the point.
    <i>Synthstatic</i> is indebted to two bands in particular-- My Bloody Valentine and The Jesus &amp; Mary
    Chain-- and Skywave aren't afraid to filch textbook riffs and techniques from either group.  The 14 songs
    here are shamelessly and often overwhelmingly derivative, and dare you to do something about it.</p><p>
    
    Of course, what <i>Synthstatic</i> lacks in originality it makes up for in songwriting formidability:
    Paul Baker (guitars), Oliver Ackerman (bass), and John Fedowitz (drums) are equally adroit composers who
    manage to maintain stylistic consistency throughout this album.  Even the harshest, most grating guitars
    on ""Wear This Dress"" fail to suppress an irrepressible melody that recalls The Wedding Present, and
    interestingly, owes more to jangle-pop than shoegaze.  ""Nothing Left to Say"", <i>Synthstatic</i>'s longest
    track, relaxes upon a quavering repetition of zonked-out, detuned guitars to deliver the album's most
    touching moment.  This atonal dirge, in particular, is indebted to <i>Loveless</i>' grimy ballads, imbued
    with just enough moments of unmitigated beauty to sustain its six downtempo minutes.  Opening track ""Tsunami"",
    meanwhile, lives up to its title with monstrous walls of washed-out guitars and driving, machine-like drums.</p><p>
    
    Duly impressive is the shear magnitude of Skywave's sound.  At live shows, the band is known for soundchecking
    at half-volume, then cranking it all the way up at curtain time for an unsuspecting soundman.  Bassist Oliver
    Ackerman designs his own effects pedals, including the Supersonic Fuzz Gun and a series called Total Sonic
    Annihilations, which Skywave employ to help achieve their massive sound.  His clientele includes Keith
    Fullerton Whitman, who used FX-pedal-augmented, laptop-produced guitar tones to construct 2002's beautiful
    <i>Playthroughs</i>.  <i>Synthstatic</i> is similarly experimental in its delicate treatment of extreme
    noise, and its oscillating high-volume dynamics more than live up to the band's promising URL.  The record
    even sounds potent on laptop speakers.</p><p>
    
    If only for its formalism is it impossible to call <i>Synthstatic</i> a great album.  Bands following
    similar formulas in different genres might be pilloried, and Skywave will doubtless endure their own share
    of derision.  But some forms of rock, given an occasional tightening of the bolts, never seem to grow stale.
    Had it been released 15 years ago, a work of this songwriting caliber would likely have been wildly acclaimed.
    As it is, <i>Synthstatic</i> lacks any shred of originality, but is probably the best of all possible
    end-results from a monument built completely out of scrap material, a shoegazing ""Junkyard Workshop"" that,
    like any successful tribute, enforces the significance of its forebears while managing to hold its own
    ground.</p></div>"|7748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7748-synthstatic/|7.5|Sam Ubl

    front, slid into a clear plastic outer casing that contains a card listing only the artist and album title
    in a simple courier font.  And that's it.  Search though you might, you'll never find a tracklist or any
    kind of information about the people involved in crafting this record.</p><p>
    
    The music inside this purposefully enigmatic enclosure isn't quite as obtuse as its packaging might suggest.
    Though it's rife with unorthodox textures and songs that detour down paths they don't predict, it's basically
    accessible and pop-rooted, and the lack of a proper tracklist is odd given the distinctness of the individual
    songs.  A bit of research reveals that the packaging convention is actually just the standard for Shinkoyo
    Records, and that Skeletons are really just one Skeleton: a guy by the name of Matt Mehlan who brings in
    supporting musicians as necessary, but operates for the most part on his own.</p><p>
    
    Mehlan is obviously interested in the construction of a distinct sound, and he's well on his way to having
    one, a burbling conglomeration of ambient electronic debris, programmed and live drums, his own multitracked
    harmonies and a wall of keyboards and guitars.  His dark roomsound production gives the record a feel akin
    to <i>Home Is Where It Hurts</i>-era Hood with less emphasis on the low-end, blending the timbres into each
    other like watercolors.</p><p>
    
    Mehlan is a sharp melodist, and when he brings his full arsenal to bear on a simple melody, the effect is
    magnificent.  Track 3 sways in on a clipped beat over a bed of ringing keys and piano, and thin lines of
    hovering guitar.  Mehlan's massed harmonies are weirdly smeared here, the background voices rising in the
    wake of the foreground vocals for a strange seasick effect.  (Incidentally, this is the only track given
    a title on the band's website: ""My Friend Drowned in His Own Vomit"".)  His harmonized falsetto refrain of,
    ""If you gave me the chance I'd like to/ Fuck away your memory/ Fuck away mistakes I've made"" on track 4 is
    the kind of thing you could have stuck in your head for days, nudged into your memory by chiming keys and
    brisk programming.</p><p>
    
    The album's unquestionable highlight, though, is track 7.  A slow, dark crawl led by violin and viola, the
    song slinks in on inky cymbals, building to a disorienting verse that ends with Mehlan proclaiming, ""I
    looked up and saw an angel,"" whereupon the song slips into a bizarre interlude, Mehlan battling to rise
    above a morass of electronic gurgles.  The strings finally force their way back into the picture and the
    song rides out on fuzz-addled guitar and bass, closing with a meditative guitar ostinato.</p><p>
    
    For its breathtaking peaks, though, <i>Life and the Afterbirth</i> has a few unfortunate holes, most notably
    tracks 6 and 8, the former being a low, ambient hum and the latter a far too deep forest of fluttering static
    and bell tones.  Still, for his first label release (he has one self-released album, 2002's <i>Everybody
    Dance with Your Steering Wheel</i>), Mehlan has crafted a unique and largely successful album of art-stained
    pop.</p></div>"|7746.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7746-life-and-the-afterbirth/|7.9|Joe Tangari

    banana for the first time and John Cale lifers who finally threw in the towel for good with the release
    of 1996's bloated, overproduced ""pop"" album, <i>Walking on Locusts</i>.  Cale's been biding his time,
    of course, obsessively studying the umbrella-strawed, shaved-ice recordings coming out of the current
    London dance-music scene, and gearing up for his own grand re-entrance into the 21st Century.</p><p>
    Produced by Lemon Jelly's Nick Franglen (Björk, Primal Scream, Pulp), <i>HoboSapiens</i> finds Cale, at 61,
    back in the major leagues (on EMI) and undeniably re-energized by his newfound musical palette, marrying his
    down-and-dirgey muse to music that's buzzy, dense and eclectic.  On his own website, Cale talks about his
    recent appreciation for Beck and The Beta Band, and the influence of the latter, presumably, is evident on
    the sexy, summertime acoustic pop track ""Things"", by far the album's catchiest song.  Of course, the lyrics
    remain as dour and abstruse as ever, but, for better or worse, this time he's not weeping them out alone at
    the piano.  The opening lines of the first song, ""Zen"", a grim manifesto delivered <i>de facto</i> in Cale's
    ageless and immutable brood, offer a thematic crib sheet for the entire record: ""It's midnight/ And our
    silver-tongued obsessions come at us out of the dark.""</p><p>
    Pretty sonic landscapes whiz by as you cruise through the album: strangely out-of-tune bells, sumptuous
    string sections, lachrymose violas, impossibly resonant keyboards, treated voices, whole choirs.  Odd drum
    samples and stray bits of post-industrial electronic noise provide the pervasive background radiation which
    adds an air of doom-and-gloom to even the most airy, melodic songs.  About half of it works reasonably well,
    though the end result is somehow closer to <i>Low</i>-era Bowie or Eno's <i>Taking Tiger Mountain</i> than
    anything truly contemporary or avant-garde.  There really is only one cringe-worthy track, ""Twilight Zone"",
    which finds Cale yowling and haranguing over ""beats"" so ostentatiously ""trip-hoppy"" that you feel embarrassed
    to listen, like your dad had wandered drunkenly into your karaoke party and insisted on taking a turn at
    the mic.  (And that's overlooking the dog-tiredness of the song's title conceit.)</p><p>
    If your trendometer has jumped into the red, that's not a malfunction.  But Cale's perverse and singular
    worldview, and the effortless authority with which he dispenses his overwhelming musicality, spare him
    from the worst-case scenarios one may associate with aging rock legends who seek to revitalize their careers
    by hooking up with younger hotshot producers.  The good news is, it still sounds like a John Cale album.
    But the full-on return-to-form that some critics have been trumpeting is mostly just wishful thinking:
    they're simply overjoyed to have Cale awake and fully alert again.  And if nothing else, it's a step in
    the right direction.  Just for fun, I'll lay down a few dollars that say his next album's the one they've
    been waiting for.</p></div>"|1227.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1227-hobosapiens/|6.5|Philip Shelley

    shoutout to Chemikal Underground Records.  The band wasn't just promoting the label that their core
    songwriting duo, Emma Pollock and Alun Woodward, started in the early 90s; they were also giving props to
    the then-nascent Scottish scene, which included Chemikal signees Arab Strap, Bis, and Mogwai, and which
    peaked during the latter part of that decade.  Of the acts on Chemikal Underground, The Delgados weren't
    always the most popular or critically acclaimed-- in fact, it wasn't until the turn of the current decade
    that they rose from the ranks with their Dave Fridmann-produced albums, <i>The Great Eastern</i> and
    <i>Hate</i>-- but The Delgados were always able to compete with any of the bands they signed and promoted,
    as handily proved by this reissue of <i>Domestiques</i>, which is not remastered (and doesn't need to be)
    but includes five bonus tracks, improved artwork, and two videos.</p><p>
    
    It seems odd to compare these early songs to the band's more recent work, as they could belong to another
    band entirely.  Despite the presence of Pollack and Woodward's familiar vocals, the approach and the sound
    are completely different: Instead of the well-polished cacophony of their last two albums, <i>Domestiques</i>
    has a much rawer, looser sound, almost punk in the songs' straightforward structures and simple energy.  But
    the album contains the seeds of its successors. Woodward's acoustic meditations on ""One More Question"" and
    ""Smaller Mammals"" prefigure <i>Peloton</i>, while tracks like ""Strathcona Slung"" and ""Akumulator"" showcase
    the same kind of singalong, hoist-your-pint choruses the band has since perfected.</p><p>
    
    Like fellow Brits like Mojave 3, The Delgados alternate male and female vocals,
    occasionally playing them off each other.  But it wasn't always this way: <i>Domestiques</i> is undeniably
    Pollock's album.  The songs that prominently feature her vocals, such as ""Big Business in Europe"" and
    ""Sucrose"", are by far the record's best and most dynamic.  Woodward, on the other hand, shows an inclination
    for meandering structures and half-developed ideas, and the concentration of his songs toward the end of
    <i>Domestiques</i> makes for a disappointing anticlimax.</p><p>
    
    The five bonus tracks reveal the range of sound and songwriting the band was willing to explore.  ""Monica
    Webster"" and ""Een Telf"" are blistering, bratty punk, while ""Bear Cub"" allows Woodward to indulge his Pavement
    fixation.  An early recording of ""Thirteen Gliding Principles"" makes an interesting contrast to the Dave
    Fridmann version on <i>The Great Eastern</i>, suggesting The Delgados were at least experimenting with
    sounds and time signatures as early as 1997, though it still sounds like a demo.</p><p>
<i>Domestiques</i> makes a fine point of origin for the three albums and handful of singles that followed
    it, but it's more than just a curio for fans: At its best, the album exposes the roots of a scene that
    produced one generation of bands and influenced another, and showcases a young band trying to claim its
    own territory in both music and business.  Still, its flaws reveal they had a long road ahead of them
    before they'd finally arrive.</p></div>"|2268.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2268-domestiques/|6.9|Stephen M. Deusner

    common ground.  It might be unbearably weird to imagine lanky, bearded tea-drinkers communing with pogo-ready
    mohawkers, but both sonic traditions wholeheartedly embrace DIY, music-for-the-folks ideology.  Both arm
    themselves with mailing lists, grassroots promotions, and homemade CDs.  Both hock silk-screened, handcrafted
    wares from heavily stickered cardboard boxes.  And both fight hard (usually with bumper stickers) for political,
    cultural, and social acceptance.  Somehow, sadcore heroine Shannon Wright has managed, over the course of
    five solo records, to confidently plant one foot in each of these genres, skipping from muted, earnest
    troubadour to raucous, pissed-off squealer.  Yet, rather than sounding like a neo-DiFranco, Wright ends
    up forging her own self-expressive format, churning out sparse, plucky bits of dissonant guitar rock.</p><p>
<i>Over the Sun</i>, Wright's fifth effort since splitting from indie-poppers Crowsdell, is a sprawling
    collage of distraught lyrics, buzzing guitar, mellotron echo, and Wright's incomparable wheeze.  With a
    voice that seems lodged in perpetual despair, Wright whisper-yowls her way through nine tortured tracks,
    and each of her tiny exhalations seems borne of some kind of gruesome emotional or physical ailment,
    strained, fiery, and sometimes oddly quiet.  Opener ""With Closed Eyes"" starts with fuzzy mellotron, before
    promptly descending into a spare guitar-and-drums assault.  Wright chants her poetry heroically, spitting
    declarations in perfect time.</p><p>
    
    While Wright's songwriting is well-honed, it's almost impossible to move past her wounded vocals and into
    the meat of her compositions; highlight ""You'll Be the Death"", despite its ""wretch like me"" admissions,
    comes closest to showcasing Wright's other skills, with a distant drumbeat and some gentle guitar picking
    backing up a haunting, spectral vocal melody.  ""Plea"" serves to solidify Wright's moody introspection,
    as disjointed piano bits pop up uneasily between dim proclamations (""No say in this/ No say in this/ Why
    must we try?"").</p><p>
    
    The only problem is that <i>Over the Sun</i> is a remarkably pained record, and its built-in malcontent
    taxes listeners, shamelessly demanding our empathy, attention, and stamina, tugging on our arms, filling
    up our living rooms, leaving a trail of desperate, coughing voicemails.  It's not that Wright's dissatisfaction
    isn't compelling or convincing, but that her unhappiness is impossibly unrelenting: Blood spurts from every
    clenched gasp and vacant guitar strike, tears tumble out of lonesome drum beats and stray piano notes.  What
    the record lacks is a logical sense of perspective: Wright's pain is a straight line, unwavering and stoic,
    with no peaks, recessions, or hops.  Consequently, listening becomes an exercise in endurance, a long,
    extended attempt to justify Wright's untempered sonic frustration.  While Wright's songwriting is admirable,
    the tonality of <i>Over the Sun</i> is entirely unbearable: Check 3,000 shades of black, with absolutely no
    sun in sight.</p></div>"|8745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8745-over-the-sun/|6.5|Amanda Petrusich

Virgin
    territory is still being forged, as the public continues to observe how artists develop as they wrinkle,
    grey, and atrophy in popularity.  The notion of respectable longevity has mostly been bulldozed with Wings
    and Steel Wheels, but its main culprits have been cocaine, cash, and circuitry, not backaches and orthopedic
    pillows.  The notion of septuagenarian rockers wets the lips of Leno's writers, but blues musicians-- the
    Tigris and Euphrates river valley to Mick Jagger's Royal Dutch Shell-- can play to their death, thanks to
    the genre's acceptance of the stool.  The Buena Vista Social Club are older than Arizona, yet their records
    uniformly win critical raves and record sales.  Really, there's no justifiable reason to write off musicians
    who blow out over 40 candles a year.  Music is an artform, right?  Painters, writers, architects, driftwood
    sculptors, and dog groomers can all produce masterworks in late age, so why not rock musicians?  Again, the
    format has not existed long enough to develop patterns and cycles demonstrative of artists' complete
    lifetimes.</p><p>
    But there has been new hope of late.  David Bowie, The Stooges, Robert Plant, Joe Strummer, Wire, Kraftwerk,
    and The Zombies all contributed vital releases to their discography in the last few years.  Naturally, as
    one ages, the appeal of music written about aging by aging artists becomes vastly more appealing.  Even
    flawed recordings and miscalculated experimentation can charm, as they mirror our own missteps and ability
    to laugh at our own mistakes.  <i>Grown Backwards</i>, as the title suggests, skips whistling into maturity,
    and employs this concept as its thematic core.  Here, endearing for his joyous, occasionally wrong-footed
    style-hopping, David Byrne gleefully releases himself to fate, both critical and existential, like a man
    who's breathed in the dust of ceiling tile, cinder, faxes, and bone.  He even wears Oshkosh overalls on
    the back.  (Perhaps.  They could be Miu Miu.)</p><p>
    If you hold the cover of <i>Grown Backwards</i> before your face at the precise angle, twisting your head
    to the right slightly, the mirrored finish of its packaging superimposes your visage over David Byrne's
    remarkably unchanged face.  Put the CD down and your fingerprints blemish the gloss with human grease.
    Intended or not, the album physically reflects and inserts the listener.  With its themes centered on the
    amusing and tragic nuances of seemingly mundane human behavior, Byrne has crafted a personal album for all,
    confronting us with our greatest fears and flaws-- mainly mortality.</p><p>
    The album's sequencing even parallels a lifecycle: The opening is exciting, naively romantic, and carefree.
    Like adolescence, tracks four through seven strive awkwardly to follow trends and fit in.  Regal trumpet
    blasts herald a diatribe on American imperialism on the unfittingly political ""Empire"".  And finally, ""The
    Other Side of Life"" arrives at adulthood, with arms wide before a Broadway melody.  With signature wide-eyed
    sincerity, Byrne sings, ""I don't have any more problems/ All of my worries are gone/ Beautiful angels
    appear at my side/ And corporate sponsors will act as my guide,"" dispensing of any sarcasm these lyrics
    might imply.  ""Glad"" revels in a laundry list of flaws: ""I'm glad I got lost/ I'm glad I'm confused/ I'm
    glad when the sex is not that great/ I'm glad I know how my life will end/ I'm glad I'm a mess,"" again,
    with ambiguously sincere delivery.  Whether Byrne is mocking the shortcomings of the average man or
    rejoicing in his own averageness is unclear, but either way, it works.</p><p>
    As the dream journal-like interior package design suggests, <i>Grown Backwards</i> floats in a metropolitan
    ether, hitting the ears like sensory blasts encountered while walking Manhattan at daybreak.  The style
    shifts seem intentionally influenced by random urban experience, not wanton experimentalism.  Opera,
    hip-hop, the funk of ""Dialog Box"", the Pacific island breeziness of ""Astronaut"", the French café gestures
    of ""Civilization"", and club grooves come and go like scents, smells, and sights on a cosmopolitan excursion.
    The album's clean, organic production-- much like the roomy environments recorded by Nick Gold for Byrne's
    new labelmates Buena Vista and Orchestra Baobab-- help to make possibly jarring style shifts seamless and
    timeless.  Like the Neverland of J.M. Barrie, alluded to on ""Pirates"", <i>Grown Backwards</i> sounds like
    a subconscious composite of Byrne's loves, fears, influences, and fantasies.</p><p>
    Demonstrative of the breadth and strength of Byrne's compositions, the album's two masterful high-points,
    ""Au Fond du Temple Saint"" and ""Lazy"", sit on polar opposites.  The former, a rendition of Bizet's lusciously
    melodic duet from <i>The Pearl Fishers</i>, is covered with aplomb alongside Rufus Wainwright, and devastates
    with juicy beauty.  Bizet, who wrote the piece at 24, tells the story of two men who turn their back on a
    promise from youth with typically sacrificial results, and Byrne fits the brick into his album's Legowork
    with sophistication.  He sings opera, a music now typically reserved for silver aristocrats who subscribe
    to <i>Smithsonian</i>, but chooses an immortal ode to youth struck dumb by Brahmin beauty, written by an
    inexperienced composer.  While invigorating a dying music with modern zeal, his limitations as a Comique
    tenor matter little.  ""Lazy"", on the other hand, reworks a dance collaboration with X-Press 2 with awesomely
    melodramatic strings from the Tosca ensemble, who color the entire album with playful accents, and electric
    guitar and keyboard from Byrne, which absolutely shames whatever New York newcomers who attempt such styles.
    It's Morodor disco and CBGB punk, not some cheap hybrid.  The song's self-deprecating lyrics, in hindsight,
    sound like the thematic font for this entire project.</p><p>
    Though David Byrne may sing the part of Bizet's Nadir, this album is anything but.  It fits alongside the
    best of his career and adds another solid release to a solo catalog which will hopefully become more cherished
    in time.  In 20 years, as we straighten our faces with botulism, braces, and stem cells, the album will
    stand up.  ""On my high school folder/ I drew a big gorilla/ Something familiar yet something far, far
    away,"" Byrne sings.  With that last phrase, he could mean the gorilla or youth.  As <i>Grown Backwards</i>
    proves, records need not rely on either for thrills.</p></div>"|1063.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1063-grown-backwards/|7.6|Brent DiCrescenzo

    mean something to me.""  At times, you can locate an inevitability by staying in one spot.  To aid in the
    quest, Black Forest/Black Sea are making music for the roof and fire escape, helping you detail your view
    of the neighbor's tacky kitchen and your own obstructed portion of any already obstructed sky.</p><p>
<i>Forcefields and Constellations</i>, the Rhode Island duo's second dose of interstellar gazing, sets
    adrift with the dreamy ""Orion"", a milky moon-drop instrumental featuring the guitarwork of guest performer
    Christina Carter (Charalambides).  Here, Carter's guitar lobs tremolo darts at the nighttime, too busy to
    notice the melancholic swarm of voices that flit around her.  Despite lasting under four minutes, the
    song creates an air of languid eternity.  This protracted time/space collusion is a constant on Jeffrey
    Alexander and Miriam Goldberg's follow-up to last year's eponymous (and now out-of-print) debut as Black
    Forest/Black Sea, and by patiently dismantling the chamber-folk that made that record such a treat, they've
    initiated a whirlybird gale that blows compositional constraints wide open.</p><p>
    Chilly abstraction is an assured move for a sophomore record, but Alexander and Goldberg are seasoned
    psych-folk players:  Alongside lyricist and multi-instrumentalist Carin Wagner, Alexander comprised the
    slowcore renaissance duo The Iditarod.  Goldberg, though not a core member of that band, toured with them,
    and contributed cello, piano, and guitar to a number of their studio recordings.  Packing this pedigree and
    collaborative dynamic into 13 tracks, <i>Forcefields and Constellations</i> creates a steely, diaphanous
    and fragile mass of delicate and complex instrumentation.  Using voice sparingly, the focus falls on
    improvisation (or at least, something that sounds like improvisation).  The duo also employs guest
    musicians-- including the aforementioned, freaked-out guitarwork of Christina Carter, and bouzouki from
    Jewelled Antler impresario Glenn Donaldson-- and samples the work of drone artists Fürsaxa, as well as
    Black Forest/Black Sea's own past performances, which turns this album into something of a large-scale,
    open-door collaboration.</p><p>
    As with most successful recordings in this genre, it might seem dodgy to remove individual tracks from
    their context within the album-- after all, the shifts in gradation are half the fun-- but here, it makes
    sense, because a few numbers do stand out.  ""...with a dead man I've never met"" is, like the album's opener,
    a heady instrumental featuring modulated cello and plucked banjo.  But where ""Orion"" coasts on a gentle
    wave, this track takes a darker turn halfway through, becoming a churning noise squall (though it does
    retain the banjo's soft undertow).  ""These Things"" follows a less dramatic pace: Goldberg's wonderfully
    raw and ethereal voice-- backed by tone delays, ringing chimes, and buzzing flourishes-- creates a lo-fi,
    4AD-esque transition into the reverberations of ""Kyy Plays Perpetual Change"", which swings along a snippet
    of Finnish psych-rocker Kemialliset Ystävät's song, ""Lammikko"", evoking a dewy forest populated by tiny
    glitches and sine waves.  Violin, staccato cello, a malfunctioning player piano, and distorted bells drive
    ""Hung Far Lowish"", with strings keeping pace beneath.  It ends with a drizzle of moody machines, a lone
    green kite amid the subtle deterioration of weather.</p><p>
    Per psych's prescription, <i>Forcefields and Constellations</i> signs off with an even lengthier freakout,
    ""Jamestown"", which serves as a slow-built run-through of the band's strengths: Here, notes climb and shake
    and sustain themselves admirably, and Carter returns to add layers to the song's drift.  Discordant air
    pockets and dyadic tone rings appear on occasion, but throughout its nine-minute run, the piece never
    commits to any one direction, ultimately flitting away as unprocessed as it arrived.</p><p>
    Black Forest/Black Sea take their time telling a story, and they avoid definitive conclusions; rather,
    this album's strengths lie in its fragmented, molasses trajectory and overall expansiveness.  But there's
    much more here for patient listeners-- those who allow the connections to emerge or build tiny bridges
    themselves.  If you're into song-based atmospherics and fractured folk, <i>Forcefields and Constellations</i>
    should prove a gratifying jigsaw.  Just sit still a while.</p></div>"|1082.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1082-forcefields-and-constellations/|8.4|Brandon Stosuy

    much: ""Ways and Means"" features the line, ""Is there a t-shirt I can wear/ 'Cause I'm soaking look at me.""
    ""Grazed Knees"" contains the banal couplet, ""Your breakfast will get cold/ I really have to go.""  And
    ""Spitting Games"" veers dangerously close to high school poetry: ""My heart is bursting in your perfect
    eyes/ As blue as oceans and as pure as skies.""  But taken together, these not-too-quotable lines add up
    to a surprising whole: an album as argument, wherein Lightbody pleads with lovers to consider his side of
    the story (""How to Be Dead""), or to give him another chance (""Grazed Knees""), or simply to notice him
    (""Spitting Games"").  Rather than dwelling the dissolved romances of his past, Lightbody dwells in the
    here-and-now, speaking not to his audience but to his lovers, and candidly reveals a centrifuge of
    conflicting emotions and awkward confessions.</p><p>
    Writing in plainspoken lyrics that sound like the kind of speech you rehearse in your head for days,
    Lightbody has carved himself a niche among confessional singer/songwriters by documenting the gradual
    accumulation of grievances and recriminations that creates a rift between two people who ostensibly love
    each other.  The problems he describes usually aren't as tangible or as black-and-white as, say, cheating,
    but Lightbody still manages to make these small predicaments dramatic and compelling.</p><p>
    If the lyrics carry the feelings, then the music itself is restrained: tastefully plaintive vocals and
    churning guitars generate rigid, unwavering tempos that approximate dance music.  It's a more sophisticated
    sound than that of the band's previous albums, or of Lightbody's side project, The Reindeer Section.  In
    addition to adding guitarist Nathan Connolly, Snow Patrol have brought in producer Garret ""Jacknife"" Lee
    (formerly of the band Compulsion), who gathers elements from the Pixies and My Bloody Valentine, as well
    as from more obvious sources like Radiohead, into a straightforward, polished sound that works well for
    the first half of <i>Final Straw</i>.</p><p>
    The pristine quality of Snow Patrol's music and Garret Lee's production, however, belies the rawness of
    Lightbody's words, and too often, the songs suffer from the contrast.  It's not that there aren't bursts
    of noisy feedback or filtered vocals or the occasional programmed beats; it's that each one sounds perfectly
    placed, too tidy, so overthought and foreordained that the songs sound staid and stolid.</p><p>
    This is especially noticeable in the middle of <i>Final Straw</i>, when Snow Patrol indulge in some Coldplay
    moments.  ""Run"" exists solely for its uplifting, if oddly fatalistic, chorus (""Light up, light up/ As if you
    have a choice""), which will surely have concertgoers raising their lighters during the inevitable second-encore
    singalong.  Actually, the song is unapologetically anthemic, until Lee throws in some schmaltzy strings at
    the climax that practically cry out to score the big smooch in some teen-friendly romantic comedy.</p><p>
    Deploying more upbeat tempos and pop harmonies, ""Ways and Means"" and ""Tiny Little Fractures"" try to regain
    the momentum of the album's first half.  But ""Somewhere a Clock Is Ticking"" crawls along at a slow pace,
    its gloomy atmosphere not quite enough to sustain it, and ""Same"" attempts a grand finale that only sounds
    redundant after ""Run"".  As such, despite the surprising cohesion of its modest lyrics, <i>Final Straw</i>
    remains less than the sum of its parts.</p></div>"|7304.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7304-final-straw/|6.7|Stephen M. Deusner

He asserts that the software has gotten so good that     making tracks is just that easy: Talent is kinda nice-- and probably adds something to the equation-- but     it's not really required.  There's no question that the perceptible dip in interest in experimental     electronic music in recent years has something to do with the fact that there are so many labels, artists,     and, above all, records that don't sound different enough from one another to warrant special attention.</p><p>But then there's Christian Fennesz.  When it comes to recording under his own name, Fennesz works slowly:     <em>Venice</em> is only his fourth full-length studio album in seven years, and his first since 2001's     groundbreaking <em>Endless Summer</em>, which altered the perception of experimental electronic music with     pop leanings.  Fennesz has remained busy by remixing, collaborating, touring (both on his own and with     FennO'Berg), and re-releasing his back catalog, but-- considering Kid606's admission-- three years is a     long time between albums for an artist such as Fennesz.</p><p>With every album, Fennesz's music has become prettier and more accessible yet still retains his distinctive     style-- and <em>Venice</em> is no exception.  That's fortunate for the uninitiated because as Fennesz's     reputation has grown, each new offering has served as the perfect introduction to his work.  ""Rivers of     Sand"" opens <em>Venice</em> with deep bass pedals working against pinched swoons of feedback.  It's completely     electronic, but this piece would also sound fantastic in an arrangement for strings.  ""Château Rouge"" is in     the vein of the bent instrumental pop of <em>Endless Summer</em>, with what sounds like an organ melody     (simple, just a few notes) beset by synth gurgles and pinstripe bands of white noise.  Its ""middle-eight""     is vertical howls of machine noise, but its purpose is the same as the bridge of any pop song-- to offer     a variation on the themes presented earlier.  ""The Other Face"" also feels as if Fennesz were taking some     of the ideas from <em>Endless Summer</em> and pushing them in a different direction, here adding ethereal     vocal samples to the buzzing mix.</p>
<p>The short track ""Onsra"" serves as an intro to <em>Venice</em>'s centerpiece, ""Circassian"", which was written     and performed with fellow avant guitarist Burkhard Stangl (who has previously worked with Fennesz as a     member of Polwechsel).  When people talk about Fennesz's Kevin Shields fixation they're thinking of tracks     like this.  ""Circassian"" drowns in loud, slightly out-of-tune power chords, each of which leads a long and     happy life after the initial strum.  The string reverberations multiply and mutate endlessly, making it     possible to imagine cathedrals, a jet airplane passing through billowy clouds at 500mph, or the volatile     racket of a tropical storm.  Markus Schmickler gave it a shot, but no one does neo-shoegaze laprock as     well as Fennesz.</p>
<p>On <em>Venice</em>, Fennesz also continues to dabble with pop.  Last year, he collaborated with David Sylvian     on the former Japan singer's <em>Blemish</em>, and that partnership continues here with ""Transit"". When a     record contains only a single vocal track, the tendency is to place too much focus on it.  That anomalous     track always seems destined to summarize or ""explain"" the record somehow, yet the particular concerns voiced     by Sylvian on ""Transit"" don't blend easily with its abstract aesthetic joys.  Still, as a song, it works     well and would have made a nice non-album single.  Fennesz has demonstrated a sympathetic yet adventurous     ear when supporting vocalists.  On ""Transit"", a low organ sound anchors the tune but all sorts of strange     explosions do the real work, simultaneously marking the changes and shifts in the song and reinforcing its     structure.  Fennesz flirts with a different kind of conventionality with ""Laguna"", a guitar duet with     Stangl with a serious Morricone vibe.</p>
<p><em>Venice</em>'s quality extends beyond its sound.  Touch proprietor Jon Wozencroft-- through his breathtaking     design and photography-- continues to fight the good fight against records-as-pure-data by making the CD a     value-added prospect.  More importantly, the music is of a high standard.  One thing that is made clear by     <em>Venice</em> is that Fennesz is a composer who spends as much or more time crafting melodies and chords     as he does searching for the perfect texture.  He works regularly with improvisers, but his records under     his own name could not be more orderly, with discrete sections carefully structured to maximize their     emotional impact. (The symphonic nature of last year's <em>Live in Japan</em> is strongly present here.)     Thanks in part to that emotional heft, I have a feeling that long after many of the experimental electronic     records from the past ten years disappear, we'll continue to reach for the works of Fennesz.</p></div>"|3036.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3036-venice/|8.6|Mark Richardson

    house while they went out to revolutionize our home with the purchase of not just the VCR, but also a microwave
    (both appliances, incidentally, are still in service).  I remember my dad programming the clock and then taping
    an episode of <i>Masterpiece Theater</i> so he could watch it later, even though we were home when it aired.
    Despite its shortcomings-- lousy tracking was always a problem-- the VCR really did change things for us,
    and I still have tapes that we made in the waning days of Reaganomics, including an entirely uncensored
    version of <i>Animal House</i> that we apparently taped off of network television in the middle of the night.
    Don't tell Michael Powell.</p><p>
    
    If the VCR brings back fond memories of the 80s, then VCR, a quintet from Richmond, Virginia, might reasonably
    be expected to do the same.  The font on their debut EP's cover seems to imply that they will, but this turns
    out not to be the case.  There are plenty of people who'll try to lump this disc in with the recent 80s
    revivalist wave on account of the bandname, the artwork and the synthesizers, and I suppose it's of a piece
    with the post-post-punk that's dominated the five boroughs and year-end lists lately, but it frankly doesn't
    sound at all like that decade.  The buzz of the synths hints at it, but there's at least as much Dischord
    abrasion and punk gallop in this stuff as there is Human League dancefloor pyrotechnics.</p><p>
    
    Despite the ragged edges they display, though, VCR are first and foremost a party band, and in case you
    couldn't figure it out from the hip-pumping rhythms and triple keyboard assault of the first five tracks,
    they spell it out for you on closer ""We Are VCR"", easily the record's weakest track.  The song is decently
    catchy and marginally ass-shaking, but it's hard to hear the rallying call as they shout their association
    with an obsolete home entertainment appliance.  They also claim to be the future of dance music, but as far
    as I can tell, they're simply the right-now of dance music, caught on what seems to be the ebbing end of
    indiedom's fling with dancefloor sweat.</p><p>
    
    Still, this doesn't negate the fact that the other five tracks are immense fun.  Opener ""Rad"" spills over
    with saw-toothed keyboard hooks, and the rhythms are potent enough to get a few people out of their chairs.
    Vocalist/keyboardist Christian Newby's slurred bark (think halfway between Isaac Brock and J. Robbins) isn't
    an optimal melodic vehicle, but he manages well, often ceding the hooks to the keys or backing vocalist/keyboardist
    Mya Anitai.  They share the lead on the EP's best track, ""King and Queen of Winter"", a song that charges in
    hard with smacking drums and scattershot vocals, only to pull back for the band's most strongly melodic
    vocal parts, gradually letting the rhythm creep back in and bringing the song back around to a full-on
    thump, where it remains.  ""Bratcore"" mashes up Polysics keyboard histrionics and Faint gloom-and-doom with
    aplomb, whipping up a great dance number.</p><p>
    
    VCR may not be dance-rock's greatest hope, as they claim to be, but they've constructed some tight songs
    for their debut EP, and as it blows by in 18 minutes, it's surefire ear candy.  At the very least, they
    live up to their name by warranting multiple playbacks, and for music that revels in passing frivolity,
    that's something.</p></div>"|8527.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8527-vcr-ep/|7.2|Joe Tangari

    drunken fan.  This scrawny kid was stumbling around the place by himself, preaching to the choir about
    the dark genius of Foetus mastermind Jim Thirlwell.  He went on about how Thirlwell's piercing, syncopated
    beats, primitive tape loops and misanthropic persona laid the foundation for industrial music and were the
    spare parts Trent Reznor used to build his pretty hate machine.  While listening to <i>Maryland Mansions</i>
    (the title is a nod to both a certain NIN protege and Kidwell's home state), I realized that this wide-eyed
    fanboy could have been Rjyan Kidwell, aka Cex.</p><p>
    
    Okay, so it probably wasn't him, but the slow, pounding rhythm and paranoid rant on <i>Maryland Mansions</i>'
    ""Kill Me"" sounds as if it could be either a remix of a mid-80s Foetus epic or a Nine Inch Nails outtake.  On
    this track, Kidwell has Thirlwell's brutal white-boy snarl down pat, spitting: ""I want you to find me, but
    I don't want you to touch me/ It seems so disgusting to be handled like a doll.""</p><p>
    
    Nothing throughout Cex's prolific recording career hinted at the bleak, nihilistic tone of the eight-track,
    25-minute <i>Maryland Mansions</i>, a self-assured and, yes, mature work from a guy who sounds as if he's
    sick of being dismissed as a snotty kid with musical ADD.  Cex released <i>Role Model</i> at the age of 19,
    and it promptly established him as a force in the IDM world even as he simultaneously railed against that
    sound's constraints and sneered at its scenesters.  Cex then tweaked the electro-pop idiom with 2001's
    <i>Oops, I Did It Again!</i>, and he paid tribute to old-school hip-hop with <i>Tall, Dark &amp; Handcuffed</i>
    the following year.  As a result, critics and fans would be forgiven for not knowing what to make of this
    skinny, charismatic man-child given to getting naked on stage.  I always pegged him somewhere between Kid606
    and Paul Barman-- a mix of electro-freak and hyper-aware mugging MC.</p><p>
<i>Maryland Mansions</i> offers an unnerving picture of Kidwell as a friendless loner-- one who's most
    comfortable in his bedroom studio with his headphones blocking out the world.  On ""My Head"", over a slow
    beat and hypnotic strings, he comes to grips with the fact that the only thing that can save him from a
    life of stifling banality is music.  But because he's not confident in his talents, it's a confession that
    gives him little comfort and only serves to reveal his insecurity and hopefulness.  By the end of the song,
    he makes it clear that he wants to save himself through music and, in the process, save music itself.
    Lofty goals from a guy who two years ago was writing tracks like ""Destination: Sexy"".</p><p>
    
    And what if he wasn't a musician?  What would Rjyan Kidwell do if he allowed himself to be sucked into the
    suffocating straight life?  Cex answers that question on ""The Strong Suit"", a straight-up hip-hop track on
    which he imagines himself eking out a living as a traveling salesman: Call him MC Willie Loman.  ""The Strong
    Suit"" is both funny and brooding, and its his head-spinning lyrics would make Rakim smile.  Especially
    rewarding is the bit where Cex fantasizes about breaking out of the nine-to-five grind by ""leaving my cells
    in your sisters and daughters/ Trying to escape, disguised as my own kid.""</p><p>
    
    That kind of playful wordsmithery also enlivens ""Stillnaut Rjyan"", on which Cex applies some over-the-top
    N.E.R.D.-style production elements to screeching beats and a rapid-fire call-and-response chorus.  The track
    is a weird, intergalactic fantasy about an extraterrestrial mission gone awry, like Kool Keith covering
    ""Space Oddity"".  So perhaps it's about time that we stop calling Cex a wunderkind: He may be barely 25 but
    with the introspective yet exuberant <i>Maryland Mansions</i>, he's officially grown up, establishing himself
    as a performer to be taken-- yikes!-- seriously.</p></div>"|1392.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1392-maryland-mansions/|8.2|Chris Weber

Though his songs may have swapped bleeding hearts for bloodied corpses,
    indiscretion for mortal sin, and lovesickness for whatever fatal disease is doing the rounds, Dan John
    Miller uses such moments of misery as metaphors for his own state of mind.  From the lurching paranoia
    of ""Superstition"" to the smashed-glass attack on vanity in ""Garbage Picker"", the amount of melodrama and
    woe-is-me fatalism displayed through the lyrics paints the image of a man out of place; unable to bear
    with the brutal pace of modern life.</p><p>
    
    Of course, this could all just be tailored to fit the band's sound.  Sharing the same ground as fellow
    mudslingers Giant Sand, The Handsome Family and Violent Femmes, the debut album by Detroit doomsayers
    Blanche trains the weeping slide guitars, brash banjo and twanged Appalachian melodies of trad-country
    into yet another imitation of the much-abused ""Southern Gothic"" sound.  But while it's an admirable attempt
    at capturing the threadbare line between contentment and catastrophe, these twelve barbed fits of fear and
    hate don't quite hit the mark.</p><p>
    
    Perhaps the problem lies in the band's adherence to such a tired formula.  On the mid-pace duet ""Do You
    Trust Me?,"" the same three-chord strum, swinging-pendulum bassline and straight-laced, derivative melody
    fail to make Blanche any more distinctive than the raft of alt. acts that thieve the traditions and folklore
    of Americana to give their sound some kind of perceived ""edge.""  It doesn't help that the song's moral of
    jealousy and trust revolves around a tiresome indecision that's punctuated by Miller's rampant paranoia.</p><p>
    
    The production, tackled mostly by His Name Is Alive's Warren Defever, also sounds largely unimpressive.  In
    his recordings, Defever concentrates on capturing Miller's voice at its most possessed; ignoring an underlying
    tenderness in his affected southern drawl.  At the same time, he leaves the guitars sounding thrashed, brittle
    and smothered in sandpaper.  When Brendan Benson and David Feeny take the reigns on ""Who's to Say"" and ""So
    Long Cruel World"", the band's sound is subtler, allowing each instrument the breathing space to make its
    contribution, rather than relying on coarse production.  Their work also makes the most of Miller's voice,
    as it teeters from deranged and demon-like on ""Cruel World"", to handsome and sincere on the likes of
    ""Bluebird"".</p><p>
    
    There are other moments to admire in this record.  The closing ""Someday"" is split into two sketches of roughly
    recorded bluegrass; one a fevered, flushed strum of strained vocals, and the latter a transistor-radio lullaby
    filtered through an effects device to sound like a lost 50s country record.  A point where Warn Defever's
    production does succeed is on the jumble of lumbered rhythm and squealing slide guitar of ""Jack on Fire"",
    as Tracee Miller's promise to ""fuck you until you die, bury you in kisses"" tramples the line between romance
    and masochism to chilling effect.</p><p>
    
    While Blanche are not yet at the stage where they can craft a challenging and consistent record, their
    mastery of the country music form, their emotional complexity and their lyrical intelligence are all
    signposts to suggest that it's within them.  All they need to do is become less tied down to conventions,
    strip back on the drama, and refocus their themes on something that's more real.  After all, that's where
    the true drama lies.</p></div>"|1103.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1103-if-we-cant-trust-the-doctors/|6.7|Neil Robertson

    cheap pop until a more enlightened friend of mine pointed out that they were <i>supposed</i> to sound like
    that.  Since then, Chicks on Speed have continued to produce clever, knowingly trashy anti-pop that coaxes
    nonchalant head nods from irony imbibers.  The ex-art school collective has fed fashion, feminism and
    photo-ops through the lowest of lo-fi fuzzboxes, kindergarten two-step beats, and tape recorder-quality
    disco-- all in the guise of an arch riposte to modern pop culture.  Three years later, <i>99 Cents</i>--
    the third full-length from the Berlin-based trio of American Melissa Logan, German Kiki Moorse, and
    Australian Alex Murray-Leslie-- indicates that my original synopsis is as inaccurate as ever, albeit for
    significantly different reasons.</p><p>
<i>99 Cents</i> still sees Chicks on Speed in the familiarly playful, reveling-in-the-throwaway mood that
    has characterized their career, but replaces the cheap sounds of their earlier records with more traditional
    sonics, which leave the often-clever lyrics feeling like an afterthought.  The Chicks' inevitable collaboration
    with Peaches (the standout track ""We Don't Play Guitars"") is a gutsy, rambunctious melee that puts mantra
    before message.  An impressive reproduction of the Tom Tom Club's ""Wordy Rappinghood"" continues the girls'
    tradition of fantastic covers, seamlessly pairing solid, dance-friendly programming with live playing and
    featuring both eccentric vocals and slick synth work.  The stuttering R&amp;B; of ""Coventry"" seems unintentionally
    candid, considering that genre's recent shift toward self-reference and pastiche (see: ""Slow Jamz"", for one).
    ""Sell-Out"", however, seems a bit obvious, and not a little lazy, especially compared to the sexier, more
    adventurous ""Shick Shaving"", which showcases chants from the sublime Miss Kittin, and sounds like The Postal
    Service with decaying optimism and too many drinks.</p><p>
    
    Based in Germany, Chicks on Speed have always shared a cynicism toward capitalism and commodification--
    best revealed here by the blunt ""Universal Pussy""-- with their erstwhile compatriots from the Frankfurt
    School of cultural criticism.  Imagine Adorno in a plastic mini-skirt and smeared lipstick and you have
    some idea of their since-derailed mission statement.  Perhaps Chicks on Speed think it's clever or
    post-whatever to embrace a more contemporary production ethos or swap counter culture for something much
    closer to over-the-counter culture, but you can't pull off sounding bored and indifferent when you're
    clearly working this hard.  If this album <i>is</i> an easily digestible Trojan horse to carry their
    cynicism into the unsuspecting mainstream, Chicks on Speed are in danger of letting their spunky satire
    devolve into mere chirpy sarcasm.</p></div>"|1442.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1442-99-cents/|6.9|Dan Lett

Let's cut to the chase, okay?  If there's     improvisation with actual instruments, it's jazz; if there are rhymes, it's hip-hop.  Both elements, however,     blend into a tech-noir soundscape that's equally sensual and gripping on this 13-track debut from longtime     San Francisco collaborators Azeem and Variable Unit.  Instrumental hip-hop has made great advances in the     past couple years, but Azeem's lyrical surrealism and V.U.'s subdued atmospherics smolder with an urgency     that's far more experimental, and powerful, than most.</p>
<p>Mainly responsible for the album's post-millennial tension are dual DJs Quest and Zeph, both fixtures of     the West Coast turntablist community.  These two lay shifting foundations of indeterminable effects that     settle just long enough to anchor Variable Unit's expansive, moody grooves.  Keyboardist Jacob Aginsky     blows a future-funk breeze through each tune, his Hammond and synth flights simultaneously anachronistic     and progressive in tone.  Matt Montgomery's bass is a fluid pulse, deftly strutting alongside Thomas McCree's     laidback drumming to form a head-nodding rhythm section that's appropriately understated and utterly     hypnotic.  Backed by Blackalicious vocalist Omega's sultry croon and occasional full-flavored horn flourishes,     Variable Unit alternate between eerie minimalism and rubbery bounce that produces an innovative, deeply     soulful slant.</p>
<p>Some of Azeem's previous work with V.U. has come off as overly political and heavy-handed.  A seriously     conscientious and articulate MC, his fire-and-brimstone rants can numb impatient ears eager for catchy     hooks and booty bragging.  On <i>Mayhem Mystics</i>, he waxes metaphysical, leading the band with easygoing,     conversational rhymes and spiritual stream-of-consciousness poetry.  Were the mic in another MC's hands,     ""Break It on Down"" might be an upbeat party starter; here, instead of the beat, Azeem breaks down our     faltering society: ""War is inviting/ Peace is in hiding/ Factions uniting/ Lands are dividing/ Birds are     migrating/ And pigs are now flying/ Everything's breaking on down.""  On ""Sound Field"", above Zeph's palette     of electronic animal noises, Azeem spins scenes of new beginnings after an unavoidable apocalypse.  He's     intriguingly abstract: ""My heartbeat gives the tone of the jungle/ You alone the forest of light/ What lays     beneath/ The creeping things/ The birds that fly/ The fish that swim/ Run along the river ."" The unbridled     funk of ""What Is It?"" yields the album's most accessible track, as Azeem, putting a hand out to the initiated,     chants, ""Put your wings on, tilt your halo to the side/ Strap on your time machine, let's go for a ride.""</p>
<p>Several of <i>Mayhem Mystic</i>'s tracks run over five minutes, their length hinting at the groups' open,     exploratory spirit, but at more than seven minutes, ""The Music Is the Medicine, So Let It In"" is easily the     most ambitious.  Featuring The Flecktones' Paul Hanson on bassoon and saxophone, the tune is a sprawling     breakbeat journey that will leave listeners simultaneously unsettled and sedated, as Azeem intones, ""Crawling     out of the TV, turning your forehead into a gray lens, experimenting.  Beware the Illuminati, they are even     watching you now/ The Patriot Actors, the Patriot Actors.""  His dose of creepy, Wu-addled conspiracy is     jarring, but the Middle Eastern vocals that float through the track carry it into dark, ambient terrain.     The song captures the album's essence, hitting like a drug you've never tried-- blissfully hallucinatory     in feel and startlingly vivid in imagery.</p></div>"|430.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/430-mayhem-mystics/|7.9|Jonathan Zwickel

The King Records founder had a long history of working with
    black performers, ever since the late 40s when he decided to get into ""the race business"" after initially
    only concentrating on ""hillbilly accounts.""  This is a man who had not only started his own independent
    label, but also bankrolled his own recording studios, pressing plant and distribution network.  He was
    keenly aware of talent, using A&amp;R; reps (who would later be his scapegoats when pressed by the FCC during
    the payola hearings of the 50s) to snatch up big band singers and bandleaders, in the hopes of transforming
    them into viable sensations for what would one day be called ""crossover"" appeal.  He tried country, blues,
    doo-wop and R&amp;B--; he might not have capitalized on every opportunity (most notably letting The Platters go
    to Mercury in 1953, only to witness them become the most successful vocal group of the decade), but he was
    certainly willing to try.</p><p>
    
    Nathan signed Macon, Georgia performer James Brown in 1956 to his King subsidiary, Federal, despite a less
    than favorable view of the ""Please, Please, Please"" demo (in short, ""That's the worst piece of crap I've
    heard in my life"").  Brown and his band, The Famous Flames, had already toured the South when he was signed
    for $200 to Federal, but he had yet to convince Nathan and Federal to allow him to record with the band.
    It wouldn't happen until Brown and the Flames scored a hit called ""Mashed Potatoes"" under the pseudonym Nat
    Kendrick &amp; The Swans for another label.  After Brown hit regionally with ""Please, Please, Please"" in 1956
    for Federal, Nathan's original appraisal appeared to have been off the mark.  That is, until Brown's next
    nine singles in a row flopped.  Badly.</p><p>
    
    Brown and the Flames finally scored a national hit with their eleventh single for Federal, ""Try Me"", which
    granted him further stay on the label.  Nathan was rewarded, too, as over the next four years, the band
    earned its reputation as the best in the biz, performing as The James Brown Revue (""Star Time""), and saddling
    its frontman with several well-applied titles: ""The Hardest Working Man in Show Business,"" ""Mr. Dynamite""
    and ultimately, ""The Godfather of Soul.""  By 1962, Brown intended to showcase his act with a live album,
    especially after seeing Ray Charles hit with <i>In Person</i> in 1959.  He'd played Harlem's Apollo Theater
    several times, but when Nathan refused to pay for a live recording on the basis that he wouldn't have a
    single to promote it, Mr. Dynamite had to take matters into his own hands.</p><p>
    
    Brown personally funded the recording of his Wednesday night show at The Apollo on October 24th, 1962.  He
    and the Flames had been there all week already, and Brown was counting on the raucous crowds who showed for
    amateur night to give him the kind of support he knew Nathan couldn't ignore.  For his part, Nathan had
    reluctantly sent one of his people to supervise the recording, but could hardly have expected it to result
    in this album.  It's more than a little strange to think King had originally issued <i>Live at the Apollo</i>
    with canned applause and screams because not only were the Apollo faithful in full ""support"" of Brown's
    revue, that night has gone down in rock and soul history as arguably the finest live performance ever
    captured on record.  Not bad for a guy who'd been one flop away from failure only a few years earlier.</p><p>
<i>Live at the Apollo</i> was issued in 1963 and became an instant hit.  Not only did it satisfy Brown's
    small legion of diehard fans-- to the tune of being played in its entirety during the evenings on some R&amp;B;
    radio stations-- for the first time, it brought the undeniably intense celebration of his live show to young
    audiences throughout the country.  This might not have been very important in another era, but just as <i>Live
    at the Apollo</i> can be seen as a symbolic transformation of R&amp;B; into Soul, for a myriad of events, 1963
    marked the dawn of a decade when sharing experiences and points of view across an entire culture meant more
    than just crossover success.  It was the true beginning of the 60s, and Brown's half-hour Wednesday night
    set figures no less prominently than Dylan bringing protest music to the masses or The Beatles arriving in
    America the following year as musical signposts for A New Day.</p><p>
    
    Emcee Fats Gonder's introduction to the show is as fine a setup as a performer could ask for: ""So now,
    ladies and gentlemen, it is Star Time.  Are you ready for Star Time?!""  The Flames give hits upon each
    Brown hit that Gonder lists, and the eager crowd responds with due enthusiasm (i.e., screams, lots and
    lots of screams).  The band then drops a cutting version of Brown's ""The Scratch"" to urge the Man onstage.
    And what do you think Brown should announce as soon as he arrives?  Two years before ""I Got You"", and he
    lets us have it: ""You know, I feel alright!""</p><p>
    
    The band launches ""I'll Go Crazy"" with the slash of Les Buie's guitar and the sting of horns.  ""If you
    leave me, I'll go crazy,"" sings the leader, and the audience can already barely stand themselves.  Horn
    punches accentuate the message Brown has taken with him to this day: ""You gotta live for yourself, and
    nobody else.""  Just as soon as he's delivered the advice, Brown pleas to ""Try Me! SCREAM! Try Me!""  His
    trio of background singers, Bobby Byrd, Bobby Bennett and ""Baby"" Lloyd Stallworth, echo the sentiments,
    while the band locks the bluesy shuffle in tighter than the tension on Clay Fillyau's snare head.  And
    again, before you can catch your breath, the band is already into the post-jump intro to ""Think"".  Star
    Time was a lesson in speed, endurance and shared inspiration: If you gave the band everything you had,
    they'd return the favor tenfold.</p><p>
    
    Then, things get <i>really</i> good with a dit-dit-dit-DOOO and the ultra-cool, slow burning blues seduction
    of ""I Don't Mind"".  With each beat, falling just behind where you expect it to land, Brown and his angelic
    backing choir deliver a fatal blow to any woman within earshot: ""I don't mind, and I know you're gonna miss
    me.""  Jesus.  Just in case you didn't think he was serious, good luck surviving ""Lost Someone"", ten minutes
    of gospel-tinged balladry somehow slower and lower than the preceding number.  The Flames horns (led by
    trumpeter Lewis Hamlin) maintain a faint bond to Count Basie while at the same time handing Brown the
    razor-sharp precision he demanded.  Between each declaration of passion, the horns serve an upturned figure,
    just enough to hold the audience in their place lest they faint from what must by then have been a steamy
    auditorium.  And can I get a medic to those two girls JB was singing to at the end?</p><p>
    
    The Flames were masters of pacing, and roll out a six-minute medley of their hits to keep the show rolling,
    including ""Please, Please, Please"" (twice!), ""You've Got the Power"" and ""Why Do You Do Me"".  The audience
    doesn't miss a beat, of course, and the only thing more powerful than Fillyau's bass drum kicks are their
    shrieks.  And then things get REALLY REALLY good: ""All aboard!""  ""Yeah!""  ""All aboard!""  ""Yeah!""  ""For
    NIGHT TRAIN!""  Brown ends the show with his then latest hit, running down a list of cities in which he was
    quickly becoming a household name.  He even gets his band excited when name checking New York City.  ""Night
    Train"" is full of complex polyrhythms and demands total precision from the musicians, but you can hardly
    blame them for getting swept up in this show.</p><p>
    
    The original <i>Live at the Apollo</i> ended after ""Night Train"", but the newly expanded and remastered
    version contains four mono single-edits of songs from the show that Brown issued to tide over fans unable
    to catch one of his 300 yearly shows.  40 years later, the few remaining folks either unaware or somehow
    unconvinced of the power of the record have little excuse not to put down the bucks for this budget-priced
    edition.  Beyond its significance in rock and soul history, and for Brown as an artist, this music translates
    so far beyond barriers of style or taste, it's one of the few albums that could accurately be described as
    essential.  Fats Gonder said it best: ""It is indeed a great pleasure to present to you at this particular
    time... James Brown &amp; The Famous Flames.""  Amen.</p></div>"|976.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/976-live-at-the-apollo-expanded-edition/|10.0|Dominique Leone

    crunked-up cornerstone of the Dirty South.  The trailblazing Organized Noize production unit rolled out
    a gritty, organic sound with blaring horns and live bass, and lyrically, both Outkast and the Mob added
    heart and soul to the bling and booty equation.  Their complex musical arrangements, gospel harmonies,
    and confessional lyrics upset the East Coast/West Coast bipolar disorder, and both groups quickly gained
    massive underground cred and critical accolades.  Outlasting Master P's murda music for regional bragging
    rights, Outkast went on to achieve megastar status.  But after three cult-fave albums, creative differences
    and the pressures of success dissolved Goodie Mob in 2000.</p><p>
    
    That the four members of Goodie Mob-- Cee-Lo, Big Gipp, Khujo, and T-Mo-- could reach a unified vision of
    empowerment within their dark, urban melodrama raises them above your average radio rappers.  The sense of
    urgency conveyed through tales of petty violence and street corner hustling transforms several tracks on
    this greatest hits collection from battle hymns to ghetto anthems.  Goodie Mob (the name's an acrostic:
    Good Die Mostly Over Bullshit) lead rough, conflicted lives occasionally peppered by block parties and
    one-night stands, and their lessons and losses often rise through the music.</p><p>
    
    ""Black Ice"", featuring Outkast's Big Boi and Andre 3000, is a sparse, psychedelic warning against the
    perils of dealing near your neighbor.  The sultry ""Soul Food"" brings brothers together over chicken wings,
    grits, and a greasy beat as Cee-Lo rhymes, ""If I hadda went and took the easy way/ Wouldn't be the strong
    nigga that I am today/ Everythang that I did/ Different thangs I was told/ Just ended up being food for my
    soul.""  Cee-Lo's cartoonish Scatman Crothers rasp carries the most memorable verses here; on the album's
    only day-glo party starter, ""Get Rich to This"", his exaggerated, sing-song meter bounces on regal horn
    samples like a balloon.</p><p>
    
    On a few lesser numbers, Organized Noize's dense, steamy production tramples the vocals, mostly the result
    of underwhelming flow from the Mob.  The Stax/Volt guitar and bass on ""Fly Away"" takes off with a funky
    lift, Gipp and Khujo just can't stand up to the bump, despite their solid wordplay.  Surprisingly and sadly
    absent from this collection is ""The Dip"", the haunting strings-n-bass epic from <i>World Clique</i>, Goodie
    Mob's final album.  That track shows the group at its best, delivering significant rhymes in perfect synch
    with a lushly orchestrated background.</p><p>
    
    With only a handful of true <i>Dirty South Classics</i>, most spotlighting Outkast or Cee-Lo's incomparable
    timbre, this comp falls short of essential.  No doubt it's an important retrospective in the development of
    some currently flourishing artists-- Cee-Lo Green and Pat ""Sleepy"" Brown (co-founder of Organized Noize)--
    but like most compilations of this nature, a few imperfections hold it back.  Skip this album and fire up
    Cee-Lo's <i>Soul Machine</i> instead, and you'll see why he's the only Mob-ster to achieve solo success
    after the group's collapse: Like Andre 3000, his artistic ambitions transcend the Dirty South pigeonhole
    and fly off into their own uncharted post-millennial funk realms.</p></div>"|3635.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3635-dirty-south-classics/|7.0|Jonathan Zwickel

    discovering that once upon a time I was a giant asshole.  Somewhere between teendom and quasi-adulthood,
    <i>Dear You</i> had been my jam of choice, a big slab of music as irrationally depressed and eager to rock
    as I was.  After listening to it for days and nights and weeks, I began to work backward through the band's
    catalog.  As these albums took prominence, <i>Dear You</i> dropped out of rotation, and eventually wound up
    on some nameless secondhand store's shelf to inflict its half-life of misery on someone else.</p><p>
    
    Coming off the yelping enthusiasm of <i>Unfun</i>, <i>Bivouac</i>, and the stellar <i>24 Hour Revenge
    Therapy</i>-- whose songs argued the politics of being a legitimate punk-- Jawbreaker disappointed their
    indie-thrall fanbase by signing to Geffen for a one-million-dollar, three-album contract, and far worse,
    selling out their music: <i>Dear You</i> was a slick symphony of guitar and singer Blake Schwarzenbach's
    soft, post-surgical vocals.</p><p>
<i>Dear You</i> is emo in denial; a tight-sweatered cry of loneliness, heartbreak, and wallowing in sadness
    that apes the band's punk roots.  ""Sluttering"" and ""Fireman"" are love-as-revenge songs in the key of Sylvia
    Plath.  ""Jet Black"", a paean to alienation, opens and closes with Christopher Walken's car crash monologue
    from <i>Annie Hall</i>, converting the clip's original surrealistic humor into more grist for the whiny
    mill.  And while these songs admittedly held fast to Jawbreaker's melodic chops, it's clear the band had
    dulled their edge to appeal to the radio-friendly commercial punk explosion that dominated the mid-90s
    airwaves.</p><p>
    
    The problem with <i>Dear You</i> wasn't Jawbreaker's decision to renege on their long-standing anti-major-label
    policy, but that the album, plainly, is a dramatic step down in quality from <i>Revenge Therapy</i>, despite
    the fact that it took much longer to record.  Songs often wander too long, and their lyrics strain for depth
    in pursuit of the album's overall sad-sack mood.  Unlike Van Morrison's <i>Astral Weeks</i>, whose fatalistic
    tone ends at a cul-de-sac into rebirth, or Lou Reed's unapologetically despairing <i>Berlin</i>, <i>Dear You</i>
    waffles between manic and depressive, unsure of which it wants to be.</p><p>
    
    Tracks like ""Chemistry"", ""Save Your Generation"" and ""Bad Scene, Everyone's Fault"" do manage to inject a
    small dose of joy into the proceedings, but are obscured by the frantically waving arms of a drowning band.
    Even ""Basilica"", a seemingly redemptive number with a more positive outlook, meanders, droning and repeating
    its vaguely threatening request, ""I'm asking you on a date for the rest of your life.""  That <i>Dear You</i>
    killed Jawbreaker is no surprise, given how little it sold by major-league standards, and how divisively
    fans reacted to it.  The question is: What happened to the band that merged ragged perfectionism with
    lyrics that read like fiction?</p><p>
    
    This expanded edition offers no answers.  No new ground is covered here for fans of the original release,
    though the inclusion of ""Sister"" and the Psychedelic Furs cover ""Into You Like a Train"" are quick
    and dirty little gems.  The eventually tiresome ""Friendly Fire"" is as close to a transition between
    <i>Revenge Therapy</i> and <i>Dear You</i> as you're likely to find, but are also available on the band's
    somewhat more worthwhile <i>Etc.</i> collection.  Only the throwaway ""Shirt"" has been previously unissued,
    and it, along with a baffling, unnecessary remake of ""Boxcar"", illustrates that the disintegration of
    Jawbreaker was not worth mourning, especially with so many bands gladly assuming their former position
    in the underground.</p></div>"|4215.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4215-dear-you-expanded-edition/|2.3|Christopher Sebela

    Hence, utilitarian inventions like the cellphone, which has turned walking, or riding peacefully aboard a
    train, into a productive activity.  Space followed a similar injunction when we decided to industrialize
    two centuries ago.  Now any so-called wasting of either commodity is considered a sin among those who seek
    to be ""winners"" in this world.  Well, pardon me if this isn't exactly the most trenchant observation, but,
    what is it all for?  Of all our needs and desires that seem to manifest in material goods, I believe what
    we really want, above all else, is our time and our space back.</p><p>
    
    Vienna-based trio Trapist share my feelings.  On their second full-length, <i>Ballroom</i>, the band make
    the musical assertion that it's impossible to waste time or space, unless, perhaps, you overstuff it with
    useless filler.  Though the group composes primarily through improvisation, both electronic and acoustic,
    every note on <i>Ballroom</i> feels spectacularly preordained, as if under the mystical spell of a world
    as it should be.  Unfortunately, that world is all too foreign to even the most pedantically existential
    of us, and it may take a complete sacrifice of one's school- or job-mandated priorities to gain an
    appreciation for this record.  But the reward is more than just musical; what Trapist have created here is
    more of philosophical dissertation as spoken through the ineffable poetry of music.  And their thesis, if
    not entirely original, is brilliantly put.</p><p>
    
    Trapist are sure to draw comparisons to composers like Morton Feldman and latter-day improv acts like The
    Necks, whose work attempts to propel the inherently static by transcending the time constraints of
    conventional music.  Pieces like Feldman's <i>For Samuel Beckett</i> fixate on subtly repeating constructs
    and protract them to Zen-noise-like levels.  <i>Ballroom</i> doesn't experiment with time so much as make
    exquisite use of it as an artistic element.  While some of Feldman's pieces would make Trapist seem like
    verifiable A.D.D. cases, what this band does with modern forms of music is selfsame in spirit as Feldman's
    exploration of classical composition.</p><p>
    
    But while the group have their loyalties, the fragments of acoustic guitar that scatter the opening section
    of ""Time Axis Manipulation, Pt. 1"" (no coincidence there) make it abundantly clear that Trapist are capable
    of radiant beauty.  That avowal is supported by the gradual introduction of a gently undulating organic
    drone, which underscores the sparse instrumental setting and forms the melodic crux of the song.  The result
    is something akin to Keith Fullerton Whitman with a backing band.  Furthermore, the synth melody that emerges
    at the two-minute mark of ""Time Axis Manipulation, Pt. 2""-- <i>Ballroom</i>'s most confrontational moment to
    this point-- is blissfully sophisticated.  The ensuing 90 seconds feel too sublime to endure the remaining
    five minutes, and they don't: The song gradually devolves into a crackling abyss of feedback reminiscent of
    Fennesz's <i>Endless Summer</i> or Sonic Youth's renascent noise saga, ""Karen Revisited"".  On ""Observations
    Took Place"", the group's penchant for beauty returns, in infinitely more staggering form, as deliquescent
    synths build atop a looming bass-and-drums vamp, before meeting to form a dazzling sustained chord that
    carries the song out.</p><p>
    
    Equally essential to the makeup of <i>Ballroom</i> is the improvised playing of bassist Joe Williamson,
    guitarist Martin Stiewart, and drummer Martin Brandlmayr.  Brandlmayr, in particular, has an exceptional
    ability of evincing complex soundscapes from his kit.  With the augment of minimal electronics, his parts
    sound like multi-musician efforts, and provide a lush rhythmic bedding on which Williamson and Stiewart
    gladly trample.  Similarly, Williamson's bass parts are mysterious and lulling, adding additional melodic
    depth to Trapist's formidable electronic palette.  Like the best music, <i>Ballroom</i> is satisfying both
    intellectually and aesthetically, and while the record errs a bit more on the side of the former, its best
    moments are among the most gorgeous found in any genre.</p><p>
    
    If you aren't up for a potential overhaul of your philosophical worldview, chances are you'll consider
    <i>Ballroom</i> a waste of time.  I admit, in struggling to consume it in time to meet a deadline weeks
    ago, the record was lost on me.  Then I realized that I wasn't giving it the time or attention it demands.
    This album is best consumed on headphones, or at a reasonably loud volume, in order to take in every nuance.
    Missing a hushed analog swirl here is like missing the guitar riff that opens the body section of ""Teenage
    Riot"".  <i>Ballroom</i> is a perfect record for a drear Saturday morning, with nothing on the agenda and
    no will to slate something in for later on.  But then, Trapist aren't about any specific time; they embrace
    all hours, and dominate any one in which this disc spins.</p></div>"|8256.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8256-ballroom/|8.2|Sam Ubl
