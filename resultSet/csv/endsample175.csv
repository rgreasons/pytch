The Beatles had <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13435-sgt-peppers-lonely-hearts-club-band/"">Sgt. Pepper’s</a>; Prince had <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreleased_Prince_projects#Camille"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Camille</a>; Beyoncé had <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12462-i-am-sasha-fierce/"">Sasha Fierce</a>; Garth Brooks had <a href=""http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1909772_1909770_1909763,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chris Gaines</a>. Parkay Quarts have been billed as an “alter-ego” of the smart, scrappy punk band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30832-parquet-courts/"">Parquet Courts</a>, but the term seems off: While “alter-ego” implies a different side of the same person—Superman to Clark Kent—Parkay Quarts are effectively Parquet Courts’ two frontmen and principal songwriters, Austin Brown and Andrew Savage, filled out with help from assorted friends, including Jackie-O Motherfucker’s Jef Brown and Bob Jones, from the band Eaters. Alongside PCPC—Parquet Courts’ collaboration with the muddy psychedelic band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19845-pc-worship-social-rust/"">PC Worship</a>—Parkay Quarts seems less like an attempt to devise a new identity than to blur the edges of the one they already have.</p>
<p><i>Content Nausea</i> was proudly recorded on four-track cassette, that old saw of indie cred and self-reliance in the pre-digital era. The recording is humid and a little sloppy; the songs are occasionally in rough shape, with scaffolding showing. Both Austin and Savage are expert mimics—the kind of songwriters who suggest a rich and variegated past without ever seeming like slaves to it. Listen to <i>Content Nausea</i>—as with Parquet Courts’ great <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19403-parquet-courts-sunbathing-animal/""><i>Sunbathing Animal</i></a>, which came out only six months ago—and you’ll hear Richard Hell, the Minutemen, the B-52s, the Raincoats, Pavement, Talking Heads, and an entire history of bands who took the nervous energy of early rock'n'roll and launched it into more oblique orbits. But people said the same thing about the Strokes almost 15 years ago, you might be thinking. They did, and they were right then too. Such is the great wheel of time. (Not that Parquet Courts are all that much like the Strokes—they are brainier, funnier, more severe and less likely to go over at barbeques.) And so we arrive once again at the indie-rock analog to a bistro burger: Something simple and familiar made with enough invention to make you feel like the tradition still has room to grow.</p>
<p><i>Content Nausea</i>—what a title! Song after song, Savage and Brown bark their anxieties about modern life with enough wit to suggest that they’re aware of the convention and enough passion to suggest that they feel those anxieties anyhow. “This year it became harder to be tender/ Harder and harder to remember/ Meeting a friend/ Writing a letter/ Being lost/ Antique ritual/ All lost to the ceremony of progress,” Savage says on the title track, his voice flat and intense, the beat poet unspooling his revelations over free jazz. And then comes the caveat: “Ignore this part, it’s an advertisement/ These people are famous, I’d trust 'em!”</p>
<p>Are any of these lyrics specifically about 2014, a year in which you can walk into a bar and see someone wearing glasses connected to the Internet? Not really. Like <i>Sunbathing Animal</i>, <i>Content Nausea</i> keeps its symbols flexible and vague. Sometimes the vagueness seems a little lazy, sometimes just ironic—rather than preoccupying itself with the actual stuff of modern life, <i>Nausea</i> is preoccupied with <i>albums </i>preoccupied with the stuff of modern life. But like all traditionalists, closeted or out, Parquet Courts seem of the mind that these changes—dial-up to smartphones, missile launchers to drone strikes—are superficial. The only difference between now and then is the shape of the toy, not how we use it or what it does to our brains.</p>
<p><i>Nausea</i> is easier to listen to than <i>Sunbathing Animal</i> in part because it seems less ambitious. Four of its tracks are around a minute long; one is a so-so cover of ""These Boots are Made For Walkin’"" (itself a punk staple as ubiquitous as the safety pin); one is basically spoken word over noise—a reminder that for all the band’s nervous intensity, they’re basically bookworms. If they belong in a tradition of New York punk—an ambition Savage has talked cannily about in interviews—it’s the tradition of people like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4539-tom-verlaine/"">Tom Verlaine</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2052-richard-hell/"">Richard Hell</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3842-patti-smith/"">Patti Smith</a>, stalking moonlit streets in ripped jeans with Rimbaud and Baudelaire tucked into their unwashed armpits, less concerned with smashing the state than with cutting through the red tape that holds them back from the wilderness within, romantics who tried to forge ahead by clawing back to the source.</p></div>"|20005.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20005-parkay-quarts-content-nausea/|7.7|Mike Powell

Take two <i>Rolling Stone</i> reviews from the era, both of which mention 1969's <i>Trout Mask Replica</i> : <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/lick-my-decals-off-baby-19701210"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one reaction</a><i> </i>was akin to Montezuma’s Revenge—“I about puked…what <i>is</i> this shit?”—while in another, Lester Bangs crowned the album “a total success, a brilliant, stunning enlargement and clarification of his art…the most unusual and challenging musical experience you’ll have this year.” </p>
<p>Decades have done little to mitigate such responses, and <i>Trout</i> remains as barbed as a blowfish. As a gateway to Captain Beefheart's singular amalgamation of country blues, psychedelic rock, free jazz, and beat poetry, it puts off as many listeners as it draws in. Which is a shame, in part because rock produced only one figure like Don Van Vliet. He was equal parts inscrutably gruff and warm, and he could be both room-clearing and mesmerizing onstage; the impregnable imagery in his lyrics slid to reveal a sly commentary, and he was able to both howl like a wolf (or Howlin’ Wolf) and purr like a cat. It’s not that he re-imagined Delta blues or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/793-ornette-coleman/"">Ornette Coleman</a>’s harmolodics (not to mention gamelan or lute music or proto-punk) as much as he took them all in and then presented every angle at once, the closest rock music could get to cubism.</p>
<p>Beefheart’s genius can be more easily gleaned on <i>Trout Mask Replica</i>’s 1970 follow-up <i>Lick My Decals Off, Baby</i>, taut and streamlined where the former sprawls and splays. Unfortunately, it's languished out of print since the early CD era and now reappears as the first disc of <i>Sun Zoom Spark: 1970 to 1972</i>, a handy 4xCD compilation (disc four a fascinating set of outtakes and unreleased material) that captures the good Captain’s cagey albeit failed move towards mainstream rock acceptance. Rather than the impenetrable poses of <i>TMR</i>, <i>Decals</i> finds Beefheart at his wiliest and most playful, a new persona that takes centerstage across this album as well as its follow-ups, <i>The Spotlight Kid</i> and <i>Clear Spot</i>. As the critic Robert Palmer once noted: “The dada-dabbling surrealist has become the teasing, tantalizing back door man who entices crazy little things with almost drooling gusto.” Take the title track, where he shoves aside the Beatles’ boyish sentiments with lines like: “Rather than I want to hold your hand/ I wanna swallow you whole/ ‘n I wanna lick you everywhere it’s pink/ ‘n everywhere you think.” He's no longer the trench-coated, trout-masked weirdo in a corner.</p>
<p>It’s a strange guise for Van Vliet, but the mischievousness of songs like “Space-Age Couple” and “I Wanna Find a Woman That’ll Hold my Big Toe Till I Have to Go” (not to mention a line that rhymes “dinosaur” and “Dinah Shore’s shoes”) succeeds because of the Magic Band behind him. Featuring <i>TMR</i> holdovers John “Drumbo” French, Bill “Zoot Horn Rollo” Harkleroad, and Mark “Rockette Morton” Boston, augmented by the addition of former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4742-frank-zappa/"">Frank Zappa</a> member Art Tripp on marimba, <i>Decals</i> shows off a Magic Band so tight so as to be spring-loaded, as fearless as a daredevil stunt team (check this <a href=""http://youtu.be/DUa5DcDmc48"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rare live footage</a> of this short-lived group). On this concise album, death-defying time changes and complex chords abound. There are also two stunning, contemplative and complicated solo guitar compositions, “Peon” and “One Red Rose That I Mean”, that sound at once stately and knuckle-breaking to play.</p>
<p>A song like “Bellerin’ Plain” contains multitudes in its three and a half minutes. It starts with a tough serrated guitar riff that soon unspools as Drumbo’s closed hi-hats and quick drum rolls keep finding more space even as Van Vliet’s surrealist bark about railroad brakemen and black smokestacks pushes to the fore, the music itself metallic and clacking like a train. A considered yet dense bass solo not unlike something from a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/798-john-coltrane/"">John Coltrane</a> side comes in before Beefheart and band lurch back. There follows a double helix of marimba and guitar that contains the DNA for most '90s post-rock in its 45 seconds. The band returns with even more fury, one of the Captain’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/184-albert-ayler/"">Albert Ayler</a>-shrieking solos flares up and carries the song out.</p>
<p>Soon after <i>Lick My Decals Off, Baby</i>, John French was out again, the band was reconfigured, and Captain Beefheart signed to Warner Brothers, where across two albums from 1972 (<i>The Spotlight Kid</i> and <i>Clear Spot</i>) it sounds like he was being groomed to be the next <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8648-van-morrison/"">Van Morrison</a>. But after many albums of being difficult and diffuse, a slightly more mainstream Beefheart is a fascinating beast. Some edges of his sound are sanded, the Martian blues inherent in the guitars decidedly more grounded. The squalls of soprano sax and shenai are shelved, Van Vliet’s force-of-nature voice lowered, revealing it be a more cracked and nuanced instrument as a result. Obtuse as his lyrics could be, there were traces of the real world tucked in there, with nods to ecological concerns, garrulous people, female empowerment. Familiar blues tropes are upended to reveal new imagery, the “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You” re-imagined as a merman returning to the ocean on “Grow Fins”.</p>
<p>Produced by Ted Templeman (who would go on to discover <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6895-van-halen/"">Van Halen</a>), <i>Clear Spot</i> is Beefheart perfectly balanced between his aslant sensibilities and the desire for radio play, as on “Circumstances” and the transcendent roadhouse rock of “Big Eyed Beans From Venus”. “Too Much Time”, replete with horns and backing vocals sounds like a lost track from James Taylor or Bob Dylan circa “You Angel You”, is the pop move where Beefheart began to alienate his fanbase. But whether you heard “Her Eyes Are a Blue Million Miles” on the Dude’s headphones during <i>The Big Lebowski</i> or here for the first time, it remains the Captain’s loveliest, most heartrending creation.</p>
<p>Nothing here became a hit or brought Beefheart any closer to popular acceptance. Instead, <i>Clear Spot</i> ultimately marked the end of this particular era of Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band, as they would depart once they discovered his shifty accounting practices, leaving him to assemble a group dubbed “the Tragic Band” by critics for his next two disowned albums. When Van Vliet returned to the critics’ good graces at the end of the '70s, it was as the hard-edged, irascible crank. This slightly sweeter, gentler Beefheart was dropped like a mask, rarely glimpsed again.</p></div>"|19923.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19923-captain-beefheart-sun-zoom-spark-1970-to-1972/|8.8|Andy Beta

Which is to say: the past two weeks have amounted to a perfect marketing rollout strategy for </span><i>Final Days</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, the fourth and most cataclysmic album to date from Brooklyn post-industrial prophet Sean Ragon and his swelling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15719-cult-of-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Cult of Youth</a> congregation. Since debuting in 2007 as a solo acoustic mission, Ragon has been gradually adding more members, not to just elaborate upon his neofolk-rooted sound, but to seemingly recruit soldiers for war. But on </span><i>Final Days</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, he’s not so much fighting to save the planet as our collective sense of empathy—because without the latter, the former is essentially doomed.</span></p>
<p>From day one, Cult of Youth songs have followed a similar structural trajectory—solitary acoustic strums introduce Ragon’s sonorous croon, before his playing turns incrementally intense and his voice explodes into a self-immolating shriek. What’s changed over the years is his means of getting there. On 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16987-love-will-prevail/"" target=""_blank""><i>Love Will Prevail</i></a>, the addition of drummer Glenn Maryansky and violinist Christiana Key helped smooth the journey from calm to chaos, and seemed to channel Ragon’s rage into positive change; on that album’s penultimate track, ""To Lay With the Wolves"", he even signed off by declaring, ""I fell in love/ In love with the world."" But, following a crippling bout of paranoia and a brutal street beating that left him hobbled for months, Ragon’s faith in humanity was destroyed anew. So while <i>Final Days</i> showcases a newly expanded five-piece chamber-punk formation—electric-guitarist Christian Kount, bassist Jasper McGandy, cellist Paige Flash, and drummer Cory Flannigan—it proves to be a much gnarlier, nastier record than its predecessor. Rather than continue the sophisticating process introduced on <i>Love Will Prevail</i>, <i>Final Days</i> answers Ragon’s righteous indignation with the tsunami-sized sonic maelstrom it’s always been begging for.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p>True to its wide-screened scope, <i>Final Days</i> unfolds like a film told in flashback, with the eerie opening soundscape ""Todestrieb"" presenting a desolate, post-apocalyptic scene (instrumentation includes a cannibalistic symphony of ""human skull"" and ""bodies"", with some guest molestation courtesy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29540-iceage/"" target=""_blank"">Iceage</a>’s Elias Bender Rønnenfelt) that the subsequent vocal-driven songs subtly inch us toward. And just as a track like ""Dragon Rouge"" gradually builds from deceptively idyllic folk-song overture toward a cataclysmic, string-screeching climax, so too does <i>Final Days</i>’ sequence as a whole, frontloading more concentrated blasts of fury to set up the more imposing, expansive set pieces of the album’s second act.</p>
<p>For Ragon, the road to hell is paved with grave intentions: domineering organized religions, morally bankrupt politicians, resource-depleting multinational corporations. But his mythic, allegorical language transcends the trappings of finger-wagging protest folk, giving songs like ""No Regression"" and the stormy, nine-minute ""Sanctuary"" the biblically charged vigor of late-’80s Bad Seeds. And by dealing in folkloric metaphor rather than name names, Ragon’s able to focus his ire on the real enemy: the insidious apathy toward the Machiavallien machinations that transpire in the corridors of power. As the percussive onslaught of ""Sanctuary"" hits its feedbacked fever pitch, Ragon repeats the mantra ""some of us are scared to death of things the rest ignored,"" a dispiriting acknowledgment that his enraged invective won’t get through to the people that need to hear it the most; in this bleak light, the windswept shanty ""Roses"" feels less like an optimistic sign of life in the cracks of the pavement than a wilted bouquet left at the gravesite of humanity. But as a now happily married Ragon <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/the-war-on-control-an-interview-with-cult-of-youths-sean-ragon"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently revealed to Noisey</a>, immersing yourself in such a despairing headspace can prove oddly therapeutic and invigorating—and, likewise, <i>Final Days</i>’ exhilarating, cathedral-toppling spectacle could prove to be the career game-changer that ensures his band remains a cult no more. </p></div>"|19867.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19867-cult-of-youth-final-days/|8.1|Stuart Berman

While his star continued to rise, he quietly released a handful of singles under the name <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29197-les-sins/"" target=""_blank"">Les Sins</a>, pulling from the sounds of French touch and British bass music on songs like </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er_lTXEcOEA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lina""</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">. The humbly covered </span><i>Michael</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> is his first full-length as Les Sins, and it finds Bundick turning away from his thin, genial voice and natural melodic gifts, choosing instead to embrace rhythm and lean, shadowy beat construction.</span></p>
<p>Bundick has name-checked influences like German producer Danilo Plessow (who records deep house as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28724-motor-city-drum-ensemble/"">Motor City Drum Ensemble</a>) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a> in <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/chaz-bundick-les-sins-michael-debut-album-interview-toro-y-moi"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviews</a> surrounding the release of <i>Michael</i>, and the similarities between their work and his are evident throughout the record. He likes to cobble beats together from a wide assortment of percussive samples, including fragments of his own familiar voice that have been chopped up and warped beyond recognition, and he’s more than willing to craft hooks and engaging passages using unconventional means and sounds. Opener ""Talk About"" and highlight ""Bother"" both hang on aggressive spoken samples, the former cribbed from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3002-nas/"" target=""_blank"">Nas</a> cut <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxce_qvhi5I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""One Love""</a> and the latter delivered by Bundick himself; the skittering ""Toy"" is built around a spectral, cycling flute-ish melody that’s tonally incongruous given the menace of the rhythm that surrounds it. Choices like this grant the record a playfulness and lightness that serve to balance its darker, occasionally amelodic tendencies.</p>
<p>With that said, the best moments on <i>Michael</i> are the ones that hew closest to Bundick’s work as Toro y Moi, which remains his flagship project. If you imagine a spectrum anchored at either end by the sonic extremes Bundick has explored—perhaps a piece of lounging, bachelor pad pop like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-n7N1RXJbM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""How I Know""</a> at one end, and the shocking, guttural assault of <i>Michael</i>’s ""Call"" on the other—it’s clear he does his best work somewhere near the middle. The irresistible ""Why"", featuring vocalist Nate Salman, would slot in perfectly alongside dance-oriented <i>Anything in Return</i> highlights like ""Harm in Change"" and ""Rose Quartz"" if Bundick was singing it instead, and it’s the most memorable moment on <i>Michael</i> by a wide margin. A handful of songs scattered throughout the album’s back half succeed in large part because they embrace tones and textures that Bundick is clearly comfortable deploying, from the spacey synth line gliding through ""Bellow"" to the bold, bright piano melody that stars on closer ""Do Right"". These tracks feel distinct and separate from his work as Toro y Moi, but without completely forgoing the skills and unique palette that makes those songs stand out. And although <i>Michael</i> is likely destined to end up a minor effort in Bundick’s expanding catalogue, his talent and radiant passion for new musical ideas and a wide breadth of sounds render the album a worthwhile effort for even casual listeners.</p></div>"|19977.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19977-les-sins-michael/|6.6|Jamieson Cox

Taylor Swift’s Polaroid album cover for <i>1989</i>? <i>Ghostbusters</i>? <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">The Beatles</a>? <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>? Limp Bizkit? <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17497-illmatic/""><i>Illmatic</i></a>?<i> </i>Nostalgia is fascinating and infuriating because of how specific it is: my nostalgia is not your nostalgia. But when it’s used correctly and on the right person, it’s an emotional weapon, able to warp hazy memories into strong feelings.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Let's Cry and</i> <i>Do</i><i> Pushups at the Same Time </i>is Luke Wyatt's second album as Torn Hawk this year, and stylistically, it<i> </i>builds directly on the previous release, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19195-luke-wyatt-through-force-of-will/""><i>Through Force of Will</i></a>. Wyatt’s still playing with the emotional resonance of his own specific memories, and nostalgia is still a primary factor, but it's tempered by a breathy, new age smoothness that rounds out the jagged edges of his older material.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It’s not quite spa-ready easy listening though. The drums on ""Lessons From the Edge"" lurch and shuffle under layers of digital murk, like a low-res jpg blown up way too big. Wyatt still loves layering and twisting triumphant guitar lines that are bound to remind you of whatever your favorite movie featuring an underdog coming out on top is, or failing that, a surf magazine from 1989.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But it’s not all triumph. Wyatt skews dark on occasion: ""Because of M.A.S.K."" is a neon-lit journey through a dystopian present, and ""Return to the Pec Deck"" sounds like two different Torn Hawk songs playing at once. It’s unsettling and weirdly funny. Yet it still feels like Wyatt is holding back. Each record he releases brings him closer to facing nostalgia head on: both the nostalgia inherent in the sound of his music, and the nostalgia people that write about his music saddle him with. But how deep does he want to go? <i>Pushups, </i>as dense as it is, is a breezy listen.

<p class=""p1""><i><i>Let's Cry and</i> <i>Do</i><i> Pushups at the Same Time</i> </i>is often beautiful, and that’s all it really needs to be, but Wyatt’s been plugging away at this sound for long enough that it feels like he’s making a larger point about the way we engage with our own memories of pop culture—or at least questioning them. It’s impossible to tell if he’ll ever come to any conclusion. If he even <i>wants</i> to come to any conclusion, but there are a couple things that are certain: Wyatt’s managed to take something as idiosyncratic as the way pop culture tangles up with our memories of the past and make a universal sound out of it. Ultimately, Wyatt has made a sadly triumphant album that questions how our minds remember what they remember. What will happen when he stops asking and starts answering?</p></div>"|19912.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19912-luke-wyatt-lets-cry-and-do-pushups-at-the-same-time/|7.3|Sam Hockley-Smith

""212"" was the seed for all of the triumph and adversity that followed—the prodigious rap skills, the casual genre-bending, and the bratty disdain for authority. In its wake, Banks charted a career path typical of a budding rap talent. She dropped the promising, beat-jacking pre-album mixtape (2012’s unrelenting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16950-azealia-banks-fantasea/""><i>Fantasea</i></a>) and the compact retail EP of brash originals (2012’s nostalgia tripping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16775-1991-ep/""><i>1991</i></a>). She navigated through mettle-testing beef with her peers. The tiffs were negligible as long as the music was nourishing, and for a while Azealia’s war on the rap establishment was excitingly disruptive. </p>
<p class=""p1"">But as work on her Interscope Records debut commenced, Banks hit a tight spot. The deal soured as her new tracks were met with indifference from label liaisons. Her uncompromising social media demeanor landed her in quaffs both hysterical (See: her merciless ribbing of <a href=""http://www.mtv.com/news/1683691/azealia-banks-ti-twitter/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">T.I.</a> and <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2014/06/a-history-of-azealia-banks-twitter-beefs/iggy-azalea"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Iggy Azalea</a>) and injurious (that time she <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/azealia-banks/68740"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">defended her right to call Perez Hilton a gay slur</a>), but vocal criticism of Baauer, Pharrell, and Disclosure began to cost her profitable collaborators. Her early career goodwill nearly spent, Banks finally caught a break: Interscope let her out of her deal with the rights to all the songs she’d recorded during her tenure there. <i>Broke With Expensive Taste </i>arrived this month with very little fanfare, its release <a href=""https://twitter.com/AZEALIABANKS/status/530445290592305152"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">announced with a simple tweet</a>. Its lengthy gestation is, of course, its chief foible. Older material accounts for roughly half the tracklist, and some of it doesn’t mesh well with the fresher, weirder stuff around it. It helps to see <i>Broke With Expensive Taste</i>, then, as an anthology, The Portable Azealia Banks.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Three songs in, it’s clear why Interscope didn’t know what to do with the thing. Opener ""Idle Delilah"" bursts in effortlessly crossing elements of house, dubstep, and Caribbean music. It’s followed by ""Gimme a Chance"", a bass-heavy post-disco romp that takes a hairpin turn into smooth merengue halfway through, as Banks flits from rapping and singing in English to perfect unaffected Spanish. ""Desperado"" borrows a beat from early 2000s UK garage whiz <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_JvvALgD9Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MJ Cole’s ""Bandelero Desperado""</a> as Banks puts on a rap clinic, flaying adversaries in a flow so neat you might miss the fact that every piece of every line rhymes. Her voice is often the sole unifying force from track to track here, and it’s easy to see a label’s trepidation about pushing this thing on listeners who haven't followed her every move. ""Nude Beach a Go-Go"", for instance, a late album collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a>, is every bit the what-the-fuck moment it sounds like on paper. </p>
<p class=""p1"">By the end of <i>Broke With Expensive Taste </i>you’ll come to see Azealia Banks as a dance pop classicist underneath the flailing. The capable but unfussy approach to melody on deep cut confections ""Soda"" and ""Miss Camaraderie"" as well as <i>Fantasea </i>holdover ""Luxury"" and the massive ""Chasing Time"" showcase Azealia as a singer who’s studied her Robin S. and Technotronic. Coupled with her bullish rhyme skills, Azealia’s chops as a house vocalist make for a true rapper-singer double threat. (Credit is due to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"">Nicki Minaj</a>, but both sound like they picked up singing on the job.) She’s an angel on the choruses, but for the verses in between, she’s a formidable spitter whose flash and flow are unmistakably Harlem.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The party line among hip-hop aficionados is that New York rap currently lacks a distinctly New York identity. There’s some truth to it. The city’s biggest success stories of late involve locals breaking out by spicing Big Apple grit with outside flavors, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30605-aap-mob/"">A$AP Mob</a>’s Texas screw fixation to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30094-french-montana/"">French Montana</a>’s trap circuit traction to Nicki Minaj’s day-glo EDM daze. But the scene in 2014 can’t look like it did in 1994 or even 2004, and it’s becoming increasingly clear that the Statlers and Waldorfs pining for a new age of rappity boom bap wouldn’t notice a new New York if it came up and offered them molly in a Brooklyn bar bathroom.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Well, Azealia Banks is it, and <i>Broke With Expensive Taste </i>is a reminder that the corner of Harlem that she claims is walking distance from both Washington Heights and the Bronx, where you’re as likely to hear hip-hop booming out of apartments and passing cars as freestyle, reggaeton, house, or bachata. It’s a quick subway jaunt away from the landmark clubs where ball culture persists, as well as perennial dance parties at Webster Hall and the glut of eclectic Lower Manhattan concert venues. <i>Broke With Expensive Taste </i>glides through all of these, just like the faithful 1 train sampled on ""Desperado"". <span>Both album and the artist revel in the freedom of a New York City where divisions between these sounds and scenes have ever so slowly ceased to exist.</span></p></div>"|19998.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19998-azealia-banks-broke-with-expensive-taste/|8.0|Craig Jenkins

Though it had been out for more than 18 months, his second album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/467-i-am-a-bird-now/""><i>I Am a Bird Now</i></a>, remained both perplexing and compelling. Hegarty had captured seldom-told stories of gender confusion and romantic impermanence in 10 songs that seemed to breathe grace instead of air. He’d been an unknown upstart signed to the label of fringe hero and early booster David Tibet when he issued his debut just five years earlier. But for <i>Bird, </i>Hegarty had assembled a cast of apropos icons—not only his refined and intricate Johnsons, but also <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"">Lou Reed</a> and <a href=""http://www.boygeorgeuk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Boy George</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4542-rufus-wainwright/"">Rufus Wainwright</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/288-devendra-banhart/"">Devendra Banhart</a>, four singers who’d also flirted with liminal identities. Rather controversially, those tunes had even <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4217140.stm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">taken Britain’s top music prize, the Mercury,</a> only a year ahead of the two-night Barbican stand, besting Coldplay, M.I.A. and the nationalistically sore losers of Kaiser Chiefs. <i>The Guardian </i><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/sep/07/mercuryprize2005.mercuryprize"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">called him</a> a ""former choirboy turned cross-dresser."" He was, suddenly and unexpectedly, something of a star.</p>
<p><i>Turning</i>, Hegarty’s touring multimedia collaboration with the New York video artist Charles Atlas, is the work of someone who has been given a sudden, conspicuous platform. As Antony and his band worked through songs from his first three albums and an assortment of shorter sets, a dozen transsexual, transgender, or simply androgynous women—""beauties,"" Antony has long called them—turned slowly with the help of an elevated, mechanized circle. Many of these characters reappear throughout Hegarty’s career. Dr. Julia Yasuda speaks and plays Morse code during <i>Bird</i> interlude<i> </i>""Free at Last""; longtime collaborator Johanna Constantine has appeared in Antony’s album artwork and is the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccLW2Jb_lJM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">striking star of his ""Epilepsy is Dancing"" video</a>.</p>
<p>Positioned just to the side of the stage, Atlas funneled live video of their bodies and faces through a web of effects and projected it behind the ensemble. It is an audacious and illustrative concept, a synesthetic design that uses humans to portray Hegarty’s songs about dignity and survival, to boost the hypothetical into the empirical. (Atlas’ video for <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkynrjJsRIU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Are My Sister""</a> is a simulacrum of the show.) Though conceived and premiered <a href=""http://www.e-flux.com/announcements/antony-and-the-johnsons/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">for the Whitney Biennial in April 2004</a>, this full international tour was the byproduct of Hegarty’s post-Mercury cachet. Suddenly, he had the ability to do more than play shows in London, Rome, Braga, Paris, and Madrid. He could <i>stage </i>them, too. Captured throughout the European run and issued almost exactly eight years later, this new CD-and-DVD package finally opens those shows up for a wider audience.</p>
<p>You might smirk at the thought of another live Antony album, since this is the third of his career and second since the release of his most recent studio LP, 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14748-swanlights/""><i>Swanlights</i></a>. (It’s arguably the third since then, too, as he issued <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Antony-3-Battiato-Del-Suo-Veloce-Volo/release/5239583"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an onstage collaboration with Italian singer Franco Battiato last year.</a>) But this is, to date, his quintessential live release, capturing a set that toggles carefully between the band’s luxurious sounds and his urgent songs. The Johnsons are in their most measured and exquisite phase, giving new life to cuts familiar from Hegarty’s catalog. They add tension (and a touch of ""Crazy in Love""?) to the start of ""I Fell in Love With a Dead Boy"" before indulging a perfectly pregnant pause that leads to the song’s big reveal. And three years before the number’s release, they lean hard into ""Kiss My Name"", Parker Kindred’s drums dancing with delight alongside Rob Moose’s electric lead. The auspiciousness of the occasion plays in Hegarty’s voice as complete confidence. He masters these takes. His voice dips and dives with the strings of ""Bird Gerhl"", finding the soul gusto he can sometimes miss in the studio. And as he drives into the wordless shouts at the climax of ""Hope There’s Someone"", you feel his call for solidarity on an instinctual level. This isn’t delicate subject or even delicate material, he seems to say; it’s real life.    </p>
<p>The accompanying film, however, tries to do too much, in turn missing the simple, genius focus of the conceit. Unequal parts concert footage, interviews between the beauties and Antony, backstage logistical shots and motivational speeches from the singer himself, <i>Turning </i>never explores an acute angle. The performances are beautiful, with the figures and distortions of the women transforming songs like ""Rhythm of Your Love"" and ""Daylight and the Sun"" into beautiful, ad hoc short films. Many of these numbers come cut with conversations with the models, talking variably about issues with parents, childhood wishes for a penis, struggles with discrimination, and moments where they discovered self-worth in their particular identity. There are stunning moments, as when <a href=""http://www.christopherbollen.com/portfolio/joey_gabriel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joey Gabriel discusses</a> communities of trans vagrants—""a transgender jigsaw puzzle,"" she says—in Boston while the band rises high through ""Hope There’s Someone"".</p>
<p>But unless you’re familiar with Antony’s orbit or you’re willing to do some independent study about who these people are, you’re left feeling as though you know a little about a lot of vaguely connected performers. They’re rarely called by name, and you have to work to keep them separate between scenes. Antony speaks no more than the beauties themselves, but because of each woman’s cursory survey, he emerges as the film’s anchor, offstage as on. For a piece that aims to celebrate the value in diversity and self-worth, such an anonymous effect actually negates the point.</p>
<p>Not long before Antony and Atlas took <i>Turning </i>to Europe, the filmmaker interviewed the singer for <a href=""http://bombmagazine.org/article/2818/antony"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a conversation in <i>BOMB Magazine</i></a>. They talked about Catholic school and singing, drums and diaries. They also talked about <i>Turning</i> and their impressions of the work’s value. ""What it whittled down to for me in the end was tableaux,"" Antony said. ""Staring at something that I thought was beautiful and magical, something transcendental, which for me is usually moving across androgyny toward the feminine.""</p>
<p>Watching and listening to <i>Turning</i> nearly a decade later, tableaux feels too specific and stationary, as though the work were only a to-scale model of the difficulty and progress of LGBTQ rights that both Antony and Atlas had witnessed in long lives as New Yorkers. Still, despite the film’s issues, and despite the relative slow motion of Antony’s current output, this concept feels as revelatory and salient now as it did then. Even if Atlas’ effects feel dated less than a decade later, this is no period piece. At a time when <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/06/opinion/toobin-supreme-court-same-sex-marriage/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one court says yes or at least “no comment”</a> to gay marriage only for <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/11/06/gay-marriage-appeals-court-ohio-michigan-kentucky-tennessee/15712319/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">another to say no</a>, and when women can’t criticize a multi-billion dollar industry <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">without receiving death threats</a>, the idea beneath <i>Turning</i> remains one of vital empowerment. And whether he’s singing about polar bears or sexual orientation, that’s long served as Antony’s most implicit message. Now, it spins forever.</p></div>"|19954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19954-antony-and-the-johnsons-turning/|7.3|Grayson Haver Currin

But it’s also a perfect summation of their contradictory aesthetic, with sundazed lyrical meditations pining for a balmy, breezy paradise that’s forever on the horizon, but ultimately obstructed by the distracting bustle and suffocating noise pollution of unrelenting urbanism. Celestial Shore songs are like a Club Med advertisement… plastered on the side of a bus that’s just sped through a puddle and doused you in slush on a dreary January morning.</p>
<p>Given their jazz-school chops, Celestial Shore have always abided by a policy of “why settle for three chords when 17 will do?” On their 2013 debut <i>10x</i>, their quirks and tics felt like genial gesticulations in sync with a post-Dirty Projectors world, while the backing vocals of the since-departed Lorely Rodriguez (aka rising synth-pop diva Empress Of) provided a calming counterpoint to the songs’ architectural-degree complexity. With the band now pared down to a trio featuring guitarist Sam Owens, bassist Greg Albert, and drummer Max Almario, <i>Enter Ghost</i> untangles the knottier aspects of the band’s sound, but the 90-degree kinks are still very much visible. They haven’t so much focused their songwriting approach as harnessed their fidgety energy into more powerful spurts, with the band’s intricate interplay emphasizing their pop instincts rather clashing against them.</p>
<p>In its most spirited stretches, <i>Enter Ghost</i> imagines the new, more poised album we have yet to receive from the recently reunited Unicorns, with songs like “Now I Know” and “Same Old Cult Story” story striking a similar balance of winsome, '60s-psych melodies and structural instability. As was the case with <i>10x</i> standout “Valerie” (not a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbKNICg-REA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Steve Winwood cover</a>), the highlight here is a customized ode to another girl <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0aHmMfZTEw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">already</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybYgP48X2DY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mythologized</a> in the rock canon that’s slotted into the second-batter position: “Gloria” rides a <i>Doolittle</i> bass groove into a big-Deal chorus, though the real hook isn’t Owens’ ascendant, airy sigh, but the labyrinthine yet oddly catchy chord progression running circles around it. And as the wistful “Weekenders” proves, sometimes the most startling thing this tightly wound band can do is just chill out for a minute: the song’s compulsive verses give way to a gorgeous anti-chorus of whispered, daydreamy incantations and jangly strums that repeat and recede like ocean waves softly cresting onto the sand.</p>
<p>However, even on a lean 33-minute record, Celestial Shore struggle to maintain a consistent balance of inspired and insolent. Momentum sags amid the sludgy terrain of “Shell Shocked” (where Albert’s vaporous vocals and Owens' pig-squealed guitar-playing sound like they belong in different songs), while the lumbering psych-rock of “I Hide” and smash-and-grab garage-punk of “Pass Go” don’t so much throw curveballs as wrecking balls, toppling their shaky structures with forced freakouts. But in the same way that they can unnecessarily derail solid songs, Celestial Shore can also instantly transform the staid into something splendorous, like when the twee solipsism of closing lullaby “Goodbye” blossoms into a kaleidoscopic cluster of barbershop harmonies. So while <i>Enter Ghost</i> abruptly turns elation into frustration and back again, for Celestial Shore, disorder is the norm—after all, at the space beach, sinking and swimming are one and the same. </p></div>"|19857.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19857-celestial-shore-enter-ghost/|6.8|Stuart Berman

Case in point, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30092-254/"">2:54</a>.  The Thurlow sisters made a strong impression with initial singles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13214-youre-early/"">""Cold Front""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12815-got-a-hold/"">""Got a Hold""</a>, evoking a more bottom-heavy and emotionally distant <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure"">Cure</a> in their stadium-goth status. But despite being no better or worse than most records of its ilk, the Thurlow sisters’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16671-254/"">self-titled debut</a> was perceived as a bummer. Their promising start dulled within the context of <i>2:54</i> after it became apparent the band currently had little to offer besides their heavily stylized and insubstantial sulk, which actually works in the favor of <i>The Other I</i>; adjust your expectations accordingly and it's much tougher to be let down.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That said, <i>The Other I</i> has a slightly different character than its predecessor, as the Thurlows acknowledge the prevailing trends of the past two years and skew more ""pop"" in a way that rarely feels like calculated troubleshooting. Granted, ""pop"" doesn’t mean sharp melodies, accessible lyrics, or a discernible personality here. But rather than emphasizing low-end churn, the vocals and drums are pushed to the fore, which puts every song on <i>The Other I</i> in a position to succeed. Colette Thurlow can project and generally sound confident when maxed out, though her vocals serve as more of an appliance than an instrument: they can bring the heat, they’re just rarely given anything to cook. Cranking the drums also proves a wise choice, as these songs are most likely to be distinguished by rhythm alone<span>—""</span>Blindfold"" has a saucy, tom-heavy pulse that nods to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB_dYLTHsPA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Let the Music Play""</a> or <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn8pJ_-eFGY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Come Go With Me""</a>, they edge towards country and western on ""The Monaco"" and trade stricture for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6026-fleetwood-mac/"">Fleetwood Mac</a> shuffle on ""Pyro"".</p>
<p>But as with <i>2:54</i>, the band shows an extraordinary ability to sound alluring within the first 30 seconds of any song without building on it at all. The positive qualities of <i>The Other I</i> makes it sound like it’s carved from marble<span>—</span>dense and somehow delicate, cool to the touch, blinding whites and swirled blacks, translucent and glazed, luxurious and intimidating. Consequently, it’s about as easy to engage as a statue.</p>
<p>Which is to say it’s completely without edge, regardless of how you define it—hooks, abrasion, tension, whatever. These sort of standards might seem unfair, as 2:54 aren't necessarily projecting ""We <i>mean</i> it."" There is no screaming, they don’t try to rock in a way that hits with visceral force, the Thurlows never make it obvious that they’re confessing anything. Listen close enough and they just might, though. During the chorus of ""Blindfold"", Colette appears to crack just the slightest bit<span>—""</span>A soulful face is looking back at me,"" she begins, and the following line can be heard either as ""I’m turning quick, losing my pose"" or ""I lose my pulse."" Whatever it is, there’s that brief possibility of finding relief in letting her guard down. She later bellows, ""I don’t want to find my way back home,"" which can actually raise expectations for the next time out. 2:54 have built a palatial structure on <i>The Other I</i>, but they still have yet to lay out a welcome mat.</p></div>"|19812.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19812-254-the-other-i/|5.3|Ian Cohen

But there <i>The Basement Tapes</i> are—an ever-brighter star in the Boomer firmament—and here we are, as their glow increases from a distance of 47 years.</p>
<p>The six-disc <i>Basement Tapes Complete</i> set that Dylan released last week isn't even the whole story. At some point in the past couple of years, Dylan found a stash or two of lyrics from the <i>Basement Tapes</i> period that he apparently didn't get around to setting to music at the time (or, if he did, apparently didn't bother to play with the Band at Big Pink). Producer T-Bone Burnett was appointed to do something with them, and assembled a kind of new Traveling Wilburys to write and perform music for them: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/835-elvis-costello/"">Elvis Costello</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25867-jim-james/"">Jim James</a>, Marcus Mumford of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28595-mumford-sons/"">Mumford &amp; Sons</a>, Rhiannon Giddens of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23453-carolina-chocolate-drops/"">the Carolina Chocolate Drops</a>, and Taylor Goldsmith of Dawes.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time somebody else has written music for Dylan's words—the first example may have been Ben Carruthers and the Deep's 1965 single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBIqd_u0lkM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jack o' Diamonds""</a>—and two of the original <i>Basement Tapes'</i> highlights, ""This Wheel's on Fire"" and ""Tears of Rage"", were completed by members of the Band. Dylan himself participated in a similar project three years ago, completing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8980-hank-williams/"">Hank Williams</a>' unfinished lyric to ""The Love That Faded"" for <i>The Lost Notebooks</i>. Williams, though, didn't live to finish that album's songs. Dylan's just not so much the guy who wrote the lyrics on <i>Lost on the River</i> any more. (He's moved on: the set list on his current tour includes only four of his pre-1997 songs, not counting a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5095-frank-sinatra/"">Frank Sinatra</a> cover.)</p>
<p>These Dylan texts are, literally, throwaways, but they come from a period when he was writing spectacular throwaways. The baffled breakup songs ""Golden Tom - Silver Judas"" and ""Kansas City"" would both be as perpetually quoted as, say, ""You Ain't Goin' Nowhere"" if they'd appeared on record in the '60s. (The latter features some perfect Dylanoid backhands a la ""Positively 4th Street"": ""You invite me into your house/ And then you say you gotta pay for what you break!"") And, as always, Bob's a magpie: the title of ""Duncan and Jimmy"" riffs on the folk tune <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSHvXOHGC7o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Duncan and Brady""</a>, and ""Hidee Hidee Ho"" owes its hook to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mq4UT4VnbE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cab Calloway's ""Minnie the Moocher""</a>.</p>
<p>A project like this is a treacherous one for its artists, though. To try to sound like Dylan is to come up short of the mark, and to try to <i>not</i> sound like Dylan can betray the material. So the New Basement Tapes hedged their bets, each writing music for the old lyrics on their own, which is why the 20 tracks here (on the ""deluxe"" edition, released at the same time as an impoverished 15-track version) include a few lyrics that show up twice in radically different settings. Most of the songwriters err on the side of avoiding Dylanish cadences—Goldsmith's settings, in particular, are bland adult-contemporary stuff, and his lack of puckishness means that when he gets to a phrase like ""I have paid that awful price,"" it lands with a dull clunk.</p>
<p>It also seems like a mistake to take these songs as seriously as the NBT's sometimes do. ""Spanish Mary"", for instance, is a chain of stock phrases from old ballads, shuffled until sense falls away from them (""in Kingston town of high degree""?), but Giddens sings it as if it's a meaningfully dramatic narrative. (To be fair, the funereal Giddens/Mumford setting of ""Lost on the River"" that closes the album is one of its high points.)</p>
<p>The MVP of this group turns out to be Elvis Costello, who treats Bob as a band member who didn't happen to show up to the jam that day. Costello's already started playing a few of his collaborations with 26-year-old Dylan live, including ""Matthew Met Mary"", which isn't even on this album. His two-minute take on ""Married to My Hack"", whose lyric is basically just Dylan flexing his rhyme chops, is a rapid-fire monotone rant in the vein of <a href=""http://vimeo.com/72540087"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Subterranean Homesick Blues""</a>; he bellows and snarls his way through ""Six Months in Kansas City"" as if it was one of his own minor rockers.</p>
<p>Nearly every track on <i>Lost on the River</i> has a couple of memorable moments: a marvelous turn of phrase, a brief Jim James guitar meltdown, an instant of the band members discovering how their voices can harmonize. But what it lacks is the casual joy of Dylan's <i>Basement Tapes</i>—music that was made almost literally in a woodshed, with no thought at the time to releasing it. Dylan and the Band had the luxury of freedom from expectations and the luxury of being allowed to make something trivial. For all its power and commitment, Burnett's supergroup doesn't.</p></div>"|19918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19918-various-artists-lost-on-the-river-the-new-basement-tapes/|6.1|Douglas Wolk

The first 10 were spent minting the band’s platinum-plated modern-rock sound, and the subsequent decade was spent trying to remold it… only to have it settle back into its predictable color and shape. Indeed, it’s hard to distinguish one Foo Fighters album from another, since they all draw from the same well of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ04WbgI9rg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">arena-punk fist-pumpers</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNwkN9vrUYY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gentle comedown ballads</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VQ_3sBZEm0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">arm-swaying sing-alongs</a> that fall somewhere in between; as their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13658-greatest-hits/""><i>Greatest Hits</i></a> compilation made all too clear, a Foos song from 2007 sounds an awful lot like one from 1997. To his credit, Grohl seems well aware of the fine line between being unerringly consistent and relentlessly formulaic, and has tried to provide each new record with a fresh narrative. But these strategies have essentially amounted to hanging different frames around an unchanging picture—like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3149-in-your-honor/"">a double-album opus</a> that simply segregated the Foos’ habitual whispers and screams, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15328-wasting-light/"">a back-to-the-garage throwback</a> seemingly designed for garages big enough to house private jets.</p>
<p>That said, Grohl's latest plan to drum up interest for a new record could be his most ingenious: make the most elaborate, expensive EPK in music history and have HBO distribute it. <i>Sonic Highways</i> is the name of both the Foos’ eighth record and an accompanying, eight-part TV series documenting its ambitious, cross-country production process, with the band (alongside Butch Vig) recording each of its eight songs in a different city. It effectively blows up the concept of Grohl’s 2013 film, <i>Sound City</i>, to a national scale: visit a renowned musical mecca, speak to the legends that put it on the map, and hope some of their mojo rubs off onto new recordings.</p>
<p>As a documentary, the <i>Sonic Highways</i> series takes full advantage of Grohl’s unique status as a punk-spawned celebrity to deftly intertwine mainstream and underground rock histories. For instance, so far we've seen how Chicago-blues icons like Buddy Guy and noisy nihilists like Big Black were both fueled by the same impoverished necessity, or how hardcore pioneers Minor Threat and go-go greats Trouble Funk shone a light on the Washington that lurks in the shadow of Capitol Hill. As a promotional film for a new Foo Fighters album, however, it makes you wonder why its trailblazing subjects’ transgressive influence didn’t seep into the sound of final product. </p>
<p>Though it's all relative, <i>Sonic Highways</i> is the most adventurous Foo Fighters album to date, but it bends their trusty template in ways that bear little relation to the project’s underlying musical-history-tour gambit. (It’s not like hanging out with Bad Brains inspired a sharp left turn into light-speed D.C. hardcore, or digging up Roky Erickson’s roots in Austin has introduced sunbaked psychedelia into the mix.) Rather, at eight tracks and 42 minutes, <i>Sonic Highways</i> is paradoxically the Foos’ leanest record while boasting their most sprawling compositions, taking a more scenic route to their usual destinations.</p>
<p>Where most Foo Fighters songs have shown their hand by the first chorus, the highlights here gradually build up in step-like fashion: “Something From Nothing” may boast a typically teeth-clenching Foos climax, but it rides a surprisingly funky (if uncannily <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkysjcs5vFU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dio-esque</a>) organ groove to get there; “What Did I Do?/God As My Witness” stays well within Grohl’s power-pop pocket, but its stop-start/two-part structure suggests Big Star’s “Back of a Car” given a musical-theater makeover. And even songs that travel a straight-and-narrow path have a welcome sense of patience about them, revealing new melodic nuances along the way (like on the dreamy jangle-pop of “Subterranean”) or, in the case of ""Congregation"", unexpected dynamic shifts: what starts off as a standard-issue, cruise-controlled rocker in the “Learn to Fly”/“Times Like These” mold acquires a more intense energy, thanks to an extended soul-stomping breakdown buoyed by Zac Brown’s finger-picking. </p>
<p>But given the great logistical effort that went into the album’s creation—and the fanboy reverence Grohl exhibits toward his interview subjects on each ""Sonic Highways"" episode—it’s unfortunate that the regional essence of a given a song is barely perceptible without the televised exposition. Beyond illustrating that upbeat pop-punk is an odd forum for a discussion of the '68 D.C. race riots (see: “The Feast and the Famine""), the album boasts a bounty of special-guest ambassadors who are given little room to assert their personalities amid the Foos’ chromatic crunch: the New Orleans Preservation Jazz Band doesn’t have much to do on “In the Clear” but chirp up its mid-tempo riff; Joe Walsh’s bluesy fills get lost in the fast lane of “Outside”; and good luck parsing out the presence of Joan Jett on “I Am a River”, a gaudy Macy’s Day Parade of a power ballad that, just when you think can’t get any more overblown, piles on a false ending and string-section finale. The composite cityscape seen on<i> Sonic Highways</i>’ front cover proves to be all-too emblematic of the album’s overall sound: a hodgepodge of aesthetic signifiers that get swallowed up into a monolithic whole.  </p>
<p>Watching ""Sonic Highways"", you get the sense that the real purpose of the whole endeavor wasn’t so much to reinterpret the musical traditions of a given city as simply broaden Grohl’s lyrical perspective beyond his usual relationship-focussed ruminations and self-help affirmations. In some of the episodes that have aired so far, we see a shot of Grohl sitting down after completing his interviews to write a song based on all the local lore he’s absorbed; the episodes then conclude with the Foos performing the resultant track, as the lyrics—loaded with knowing references to “<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muddy_Waters"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">muddy water</a>,” “<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_13th_Floor_Elevators"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the 13th floor</a>,” and “<a href=""http://bluebirdcafe.com/index.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bluebirds</a>”—are splashed across the screen practically begging for I-see-what-you-did-there acknowledgement. Ironically, in trying to tap into the mystique of America’s most storied cities, Foo Fighters completely demystify their own creative process, effectively turning the <i>Sonic Highways</i> project into a glorified homework assignment—educational, perhaps, but laboriously procedural.  </p></div>"|19864.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19864-foo-fighters-sonic-highways/|5.6|Stuart Berman

The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> protégé and collaborator allows no sample to go unaltered and no synth to go unprocessed; even the peripherals of <i>Immunity</i> are meticulous and substantial enough to reward closer listening. It's fitting, then, that Hopkins revisits his material on the <i>Asleep Versions</i> EP, stripping it down and recontextualizing the subtleties in lush ambient compositions.</p>
<p>Starting with <i>Immunity'</i>s titular closer, Hopkins re-works four <i>Immunity </i>highlights in reverse order, taking care to dismantle the heavy crackle of beats which defined ""Form by Firelight"", ""Breathe This Air"", and ""Open Eye Signal"". The space left over from his excavation remains unfilled, leaving simple piano chords, pattering percussion, field recordings, and vocal elements enough room to realize their full potential. You learn when listening to the new version of ""Immunity"" that maybe Scottish singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2363-king-creosote"">King Creosote</a>'s humbling vibrato should've always had a place at the forefront of Hopkins' original mix.</p>
<p>Recorded in Mosfellsbær, Iceland (just outside of Reykjavik), <i>Asleep Versions</i> was conceived as a single piece of music, and it works best that way. Each section of the 25-minute recording flows seamlessly together, thanks largely to its shared wintry chill. Hopkins' characteristic attention to detail feels further pronounced when he treats such subtle shifts in tone with austerity and drama. ""Open Eye Signal (Asleep Version)"" drifts on seven minutes of glacial pads and choral voices before a lone piano surfaces to give the EP its serene finale. All of which is preceded by the slow-coming flurry in ""Breathe This Air (Asleep Version)"", sounding like a restrained <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"">Tim Hecker</a> with its crystalline synth flicker, weighty bass drops, and smears of tonal texture. Maybe Icelandic winters just bring a certain kind of frozen majesty out of electronic producers.</p>
<p>Whether it's the pap-pap-pap of a live xylophone or muffled thuds and brittle ticks hinting at a rhythmic structure, the record often feels haunted by <i>Immunity</i>'s beats, like ghosts unreconciled with their forcible extraction. That quality does well to diversify what might've otherwise been a typical addition to the lineage of ""ambient versions"" in electronic music, and helps complement Hopkins' brilliant fourth album by never trying to overshadow his original work.</p></div>"|19922.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19922-jon-hopkins-asleep-versions-ep/|7.4|Patric Fallon

Pat Mahoney isn’t quite in that category yet, but after watching his indefatigable energy (and running shorts) seated behind the drum kit as he powered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"">LCD Soundsystem</a> for a decade, it’s startling to realize that the honeyed vocals heard on Museum of Love’s debut album belong to him. </p>
<p>Even beyond that prominent role in the label’s flagship act, Mahoney and bandmate Dennis McNany are already <a href=""http://dfarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DFA</a> family. The latter released a handful of singles as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31351-jee-day/"">Jee Day</a>, lent a hand to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6175-shit-robot/"">Shit Robot</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19112-shit-robot-we-got-a-love/""><i>We Got a Love</i></a>, mixed a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3246-panthers/"">Panthers</a> single, and even recorded a track for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3529-the-rapture/"">the Rapture</a>. But rather than shade towards LCD’s sound, Museum of Love pull from the playbook of DFA’s other big band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28006-holy-ghost/"">Holy Ghost!</a>, favoring the timbres, patch settings, and smooth productions of elegant 1980s new wave and nu-romantic acts.</p>
<p>After the minute-long instrumental opener ""Horizonlator"", Mahoney’s voice is front and center on ""Down South"", and it’s such a dead ringer for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1479-bryan-ferry/"">Bryan Ferry</a> in his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6054-roxy-music/"">Roxy Music</a> prime—right down to his aching near-sigh—that it makes you wonder how such a secret weapon was not deployed on an LCD single. Even during <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>'s heyday, Kurt Cobain <a href=""http://youtu.be/Fpyd9EQpFz0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">let Dave Grohl sing on a B-side</a>. And as Mahoney gets his voice to soar towards a falsetto and then swoop down into a lower register, McNany has his battery of synths shadow him, making for a dynamic track that keeps revealing new surprises across its runtime. But the favor is returned when Mahoney’s tireless disco hi-hat patterns entwine with McNany’s distorted thumb piano riff on the more uptempo polyrhythmic track ""In Infancy"".</p>
<p>Gentle arpeggios open ""FATHERS"", again buoying Mahoney’s heartbreaking falsetto, which this time balances equal parts Ferry and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1967-mark-hollis/"">Mark Hollis</a> circa Talk Talk’s debut. Glints of other bands appear and withdraw throughout the album, be it <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/138-art-of-noise/"">Art of Noise</a> (check the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux3u31SAeEM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Moments in Love""</a> exhalations in the background of ""Learned Helplessness in Rats (Disco Drummer)""), Spandau Ballet, Level 42, Ultravox and more, but the duo is careful to not allow such grace notes turn into direct homages. </p>
<p>The album’s centerpiece and first single ""The Who’s Who of Who Cares"" starts off as the perfect track to segue from something like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14576-todd-terje/"">Todd Terje</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHiqPG0526U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Inspector Norse""</a>, a spry Italo synth riff augmented by a dry drum machine tock. Mahoney intimately coos as horns and female voices dart in and out of the mix. For a track with such insouciance in its chorus, Mahoney nevertheless conveys the deepest sincerity.</p>
<p>That crafty juxtaposition of conflicting sentiments also comes to the fore on ""Monotronic"", a dreamy song that, heard post-election, seems to have gained resonance overnight. A jittery yet narcotized keyboard motif that could come from any <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a> album moves behind a sleepy Mahoney vocal, who murmurs indolent first-world problem lines like: ""I wasn’t made for this much happiness"" and ""The waking world was never meant for me."" But as the song picks up momentum and starts to crest, Mahoney’s voice pivots and midway through the track, a deeper commentary comes into play: ""Welcome to our nation/ With its fatal concentration of wealth and loss/ All we know for certain is that we could bear the burden of waking up."" So when Mahoney comes back to the admission about ""this much happiness,"" that once-sweet voice now has just a hint of bitterness and resignation to it.</p></div>"|19971.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19971-museum-of-love-museum-of-love/|7.7|Andy Beta

Not only has the band they co-founded, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29754-the-men/"" target=""_blank"">the Men</a>, maintained a prolific rate of production (with five albums and two EPs in the past five years), they’ve been able to bend its sound to satisfy their every passing whim, be it loogie-hocking scum-punk, wood-cabin country rock, atomic psychedelia, or old-school '80s indie. And yet, they’re not ones to spend their days off between tours getting caught up on ""</span>The Walking Dead"".<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> Much of their downtime since 2010 has been devoted to Dream Police, where, with the help of producer Kyle Keays-Hagerman and a trusty drum machine, they’ve been workshopping song ideas that exist on the peripheries of the Men’s elastic sound, but aren’t really suited to that band’s five-man attack.</span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p>While Perro and Chiericozzi have previously issued Dream Police material in limited-edition cassette runs, they couldn’t have picked a better time to release their first proper album for <a href=""http://www.sacredbonesrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sacred Bones</a>. On last spring’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18971-the-men-tomorrows-hits/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tomorrow’s Hits</i></a>, the Men sounded like they were settling into a cozy, classic-rock cul de sac, sanding down the edges of their punk and country influences into an easy-going boogie. Though it was a notable adjustment, it didn’t open up any unexplored avenues for the band. So the robotic rhythms, laser-beam synths, and industrialized guitar noise that form the foundation of <i>Hypnotized</i> introduce welcome new dimensions to Perro and Chiericozzi’s sonic palette, and encourage a renewed streak of irreverent experimentation for a couple of guys who appeared to be digging in their heels. But while <i>Hypnotized</i> nudges Perro and Chiericozzi out of their established comfort zone, it also has the effect of making you appreciate the tightened-up craft and finely curated song selection they exhibit with the Men.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p>
<p><i>Hypnotized</i> proves be a far more eclectic affair than initially suggested by its title-track single, which is exactly the sort of electro-blooze stomp you’d expect from a couple of scruffy rockers tinkering around with synthetic beats. The spectrum here spans Teutonic post-punk to somber psych-folk (really, pretty much every subgenre of rock <i>except</i> the arena-ready power-pop suggested by Dream Police’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/732-cheap-trick/"">Cheap Trick</a>-nodding name), but several songs simply stretch out a one-note idea until there’s nothing more to do: the bass-grooved ""My Mama’s Dead"" imagines ""Hey Joe"" being half-remembered by a megaphone-wielding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6554-mark-e-smith/"">Mark E. Smith</a>; ""John"" is a repetitious blues swing akin to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD1_GgxlLu8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Stooges’ ""I Need Somebody""</a>, but sapped of the menacing desperation. And though Dream Police carry over the Men tradition of penning <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFBCuDrXxwA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">acoustic odes to girls</a>, the downcast lysergic lullaby ""Iris"" (appended with what can only be described in 2014 as ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/57232-the-war-on-drugs-responds-to-douche-mark-kozelek-i-dont-have-time-for-idiots/"">beer-commercial guitar</a>"") and highlands-bound hymn ""Sandy"" (a church-bell-clanging duet between Chiericozzi and Brooklyn artist <a href=""http://hollyoverton.com/home.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Holly Overton</a>) feel more random and out of place in this mechanized context than they would on a Men record, suggesting Perro and Chiericozzi may need to start yet another, folk-focused project to accommodate their unplugged urges.</p>
<p>The most successful experiments here don’t simply add tech textures to Perro and Chiericozzi’s guitar grind, but use them to reshape it, and invest the duo’s muscular crunch with a more androgynous energy: ""Pouring Rain"" folds early-'80s skinny-tie standards like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIpfWORQWhU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Flock of Seagulls’ ""I Ran (So Far Away)""</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEQkIEkxm7k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Martha and the Muffins’ ""Echo Beach""</a> into late-'80s post-hardcore screech, while ""Let It Be"" is a glorious <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"">Neu!</a>-wave instrumental that reroutes the Autobahn through the American heartland, its synth-smoothed pave job nicked with countrified slide-guitar licks. Of course, it figures that a couple of studious rock historians like Perro and Chiericozzi would cop a title that their heroes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3559-the-replacements/"">the Replacements</a> likewise <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11676-sorry-ma-forgot-to-take-out-the-trash-stink-hootenanny-let-it-be/"">stole</a> from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13430-let-it-be/"">the Beatles</a>. But in this case, the song is less an explicit tribute to the classics of yore than an embodiment of the title’s contented, live-and-let-live sentiment—and an indicator that Dream Police do their best work when roaming lawless fantasias.</p></div>"|19865.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19865-dream-police-hypnotized/|6.2|Stuart Berman

Sure, as Magik Markers surpassed the half-decade barrier, some of their songs pulled back on the earlier feedback and distortion, the ruptured rhythms and full-band hysterics. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10700-boss/""><i>BOSS</i></a>, for instance, featured tunes that might have been college-rock singles for the right DJ, like the slinking ""Taste"" or the build-to-burn piano tune, ""Four/The Ballad of Harry Angstrom"". But as late as last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18700-magik-markers-surrender-to-the-fantasy/""><i>Surrender to the Fantasy</i></a>, Magik Markers had hardly normalized. That album opened with ""Crebs"", a steady snarl that slowly interred itself in scorched-amp hiss and fuzz. Magik Markers are less active and aggressive than they once were, but they’re still not exactly the kind of band you’d leave alone in a room with a potential pop hit and a mixing board. It might get messy.</p>
<p>But ""Superstitious"", which cracks open with quickened-pulse drums and radiant piano chords, feels like the first draft of a song and structure suited for popular consumption—not blogs, but the top of <i>Billboard</i>. For all of Magik Markers’ ripostes and pugnacity, this is a disarming love song about falling for someone so deeply that you give up your lack of belief in the supernatural, for fear of ruining what you’ve found. ""I cross my fingers, baby/ I touch every tree,"" Ambrogio sings, multi-tracked but humble harmonies crisscrossing behind her. ""I block the paths of black cats/ To keep you loving me."" During the song’s four minutes, Jason Quever’s marching-band drums push ahead of the piano, and the background vocals grow bigger and bolder. But the tune barely changes, treating the sweetly declarative refrain just like the illustrative verses. It feels like a full-band version of a tune begging to become electronic pop, to explode into one final, overloaded chorus. You can imagine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31596-sylvan-esso/"">Sylvan Esso</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28373-phantogram/"">Phantogram</a> pushing it to new heights, or even Katy Perry during her days of <i>Teenage Dream</i>. Magik Markers never had a chance with this one.</p>
<p>That introduction isn’t an outlier, either: About half of <i>The Immoralist</i> suggests low-budget renditions of tracks meant for bigger spaces and studios. ""Stopped Clocks"" is an anxious, agitated pop-punk romp, where Ambrogio turns the jargon of paranoia into an irresistible hook over an irrepressible beat. And ""Reservoir"" drifts through aestival reverie, steady piano chords, and circling guitar riffs guiding her soft approach into romantic escapism. ""Taking hands, making fools of ourselves,"" she offers with alluring calm. ""I don’t want this no one else."" And with its aphorisms about death, details about life and generally flawless hook, you can imagine the haze and drone lifting from behind piano-and-cello closer ""Arkansas"" like morning dew, moving the tune from the domain of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31101-sam-smith/"">Sam Smith</a>.</p>
<p>But those budget hits and the appearance of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29211-waka-flocka-flame/"">Waka Flocka</a> on the album’s cover as a stand-in for Ambrogio shouldn’t trick you into thinking she’s given up on her more plangent past. Even the most radio-ready songs warp in some way, whether it’s the tidal harmonium drone that introduces that sweeping finale or the hard-angled, distortion-pocked counter-riffs of ""Stopped Clocks"". Ambrogio slinks into the fragmented poetry of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30653-bodyhead/"">Body/Head</a> for ""Kylie"", a discursive and forlorn look at a former friend, maybe a pretty party girl, whose life has slipped into depressive solitude. During ""Clarinet Queen"", Ambrogio alludes to her noise associations with a particularly brittle guitar solo, here a crooked exclamation mark cut into the middle of an otherwise downcast number. By the time ""Far From Home"" ends, it’s stumbled into drifting sections of gentle coos and cymbal crashes. But it builds in a fit of static and squall until, by the end, the song breaks into a rhythm-less shriek of guitar. Where Magik Markers might’ve once caught that jagged thread and ziplined toward a fisticuffs, though, Ambrogio simply moves along to ""Stopped Clocks"".</p>
<p>If it sounds like Ambrogio is sitting on a fence during <i>The Immoralist</i>, she is. She’s an exceptional songwriter, with a touch for hooks that withstand production choices or context. This has been apparent in Magik Markers for at least half of that band’s life. But she also comes from a lineage of punk pranksters and art-rock iconoclasts, musicians who’d rather destroy a song altogether than see it played too straight. Ambrogio, at this point, seems undecided, and that’s for better and worse. That indecision turns <i>The Immoralist</i> into an intriguing listen, a sort of garden of forking paths. Could she make a pop record in earnest, or would she even want to? Or will her work always entail a measure of transgression, no matter the triumph of the material?</p></div>"|19991.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19991-elisa-ambrogio-the-immoralist/|7.3|Grayson Haver Currin

In the 35-year-old electronic producer’s latest dystopian vision, the Earth’s layers peel back with painstaking certainty while everything else bursts and pops in unrest. Temperatures flash between frostbite and flame. There are moments of unsettling calm, only to be ruptured by bruised sky, acid rain, famine, disease. Unknown beings attack, armed with tones set to bewilder. Somewhere, the sound of a muffled Billie Holiday acetate being mauled by a pack of lions echoes through the murk. There is last-chance dancing—or are those people just <i>running away</i>?</p>
<p class=""p1"">As far as end-times scenarios go, the one Clark sets forth on his eponymous seventh album is vivid. And while there’s plenty of terror to be found here, <i>Clark</i> resonates because it pinpoints both the humanity and the nothingness that come along with complete dread; he knows that in order for annihilation to mean anything, you have to care about what’s being annihilated. Because for every laser-burned bass kick and alien-probe synth, forces of good cautiously look out from the rubble in the form of twinkling lullabies and melancholic piano loops. In cinematic sci-fi terms—and it’s hard <i>not</i> to think of this record as a kind of headphone IMAX experience—<i>Clark</i> is more akin to Alfonso Cuarón’s devastating infertility parable <a href=""http://youtu.be/2VT2apoX90o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Children of Men</i></a> than, say, <i>Independence Day</i>: ominous because its pulse feels all too real.</p>
<p class=""p1"">At this point, Clark has been translating his wracked emotions via machines—samplers, software, synths—for about half his life, and <i>Clark</i> has him merging techno, electro, noise, classical, ambient, and post-rock with the skill of a virtuoso. Growing up just outside of London, he indulged in nascent omnivorous Internet-era listening habits, giving time to indie rap, Pavement, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3921-squarepusher/"">Squarepusher</a> as a teen before <a href=""http://warp.net/records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp</a> deemed him next-in-line to their mindful electronic throne at the start of this century. Though it was probably unfair to expect Clark to live up to the legacies of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a>, it was also inevitable. But with his third album, 2006’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9557-body-riddle/""><i>Body Riddle</i></a>, he quietly did just that, turning in an opus that moved the sounds of Warp’s classic 1990s roster forward, mixing sensuousness and mechanics to create a 21st century cyborg touchstone.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Owing to the mercurial nature of his tracks, which often morph unexpectedly many times across just a few minutes, follow-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11240-turning-dragon/""><i>Turning Dragon </i></a>was nearly as excellent but utterly different, trading in spectral atmosphere and hip-hop rhythms for a more full-on techno thrust. And after five years of frustratingly diffuse material that had the producer grasping at new styles and textures with mixed success, <i>Clark</i> is a much-welcomed return that locates the midpoint between <i>Body Riddle</i>’s tangibility and <i>Turning Dragon</i>’s bulletproof sheen. The album adds a fresh layer of grandiosity that hints at festival-sized dance music or even Trent Reznor’s churning soundtrack work while never bowing down to any type of current trend. <i>Clark</i> is like Aphex’s comeback <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19755-aphex-twin-syro/""><i>Syro</i></a> in that it showcases a veteran artist living and breathing within a sonic space of his own creation—and the fact that no one would confuse the two records is a testament to Clark’s hard-won individuality.</p>
<p class=""p1"">What’s always set Clark apart is his eclecticism, dynamism, and flair for the dramatic, all of which is on fine display here. His tracks don’t drop as much as they slip or swerve, forever off-balance. He’ll end a techno album with eight minutes of beatless, sky-cracking ecstasy you’d expect to find on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"">Sigur Rós</a> LP, and it will make sense. He’s allergic to the idea of standard sounds and presets, which is partly why we’re still talking about him 13 years after his debut. And unlike many of his more insular peers, Clark can be open to sentimentality—not schmaltz as much as a belief in humanness and all its inexact wonder. In electronic music’s never-ending battle between man and machine, he’s seeking a third way. “It's just far too easy these days,” he said in an <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1y98k8/hey_this_is_clarki_record_music_for_warp_records/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> earlier this year, talking about the copy-and-paste replicability of so much modern composition. “I'm often inspired by the path of most resistance. Looking for those tiny snippets of error—machines being pushed into areas of behavior that seem wrong and unusable. There is real fruit there.”</p>
<p class=""p3"">Rather than fighting the SoundCloud hivemind with real people playing real instruments, à la Daft Punk’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories/""><i>Random Access Memories</i></a>, he composed <i>Clark</i> largely on a computer by himself in a barn in the middle of the English countryside, cracking codes and inflicting glitches. As computerized watches and glasses inch toward ubiquity, this idea of subverting machines to make them more human seems like a particularly worthy preservation strategy—and nobody does that quite like Clark. Yes, he makes music that sounds like the end of the world. But he also makes you want to live long enough to see what that will look like.</p></div>"|19905.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19905-clark-clark/|8.3|Ryan Dombal

In a revolving gallery of evaporative avant-pop weirdos, they churn out album after distinctive album without ever breaching self-parody. As an aesthetic conceit, ""weird"" only works as long as it's novel—if you're going to wallow in it for two decades, you'd better be prepared to regenerate yourself constantly. But Deerhoof make music like a group of friends who never get sick of each other's jokes. Their 13th album, <i>La Isla Bonita</i>, is among their most accessible, reaching for moments of escapism that never entered the frame on 2012's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16993-breakup-song/""><i>Breakup Songs</i></a>.</p>
<p>Between the album's title and the name of its first track, ""Paradise Girls"", <i>La Isla Bonita</i> promises tropical hues that it only delivers superficially. On a mechanical level, it functions the way Deerhoof's music has always functioned: isolated lyrical snippets pop in and out, refusing to cohere into a narrative, while the guitar, drums, and bass alternately concoct blissful grooves and total disorientation. Deerhoof thrive in the space between the sugar you want and the acid you get.</p>
<p>They're generous with their ironies on <i>La Isla Bonita,</i> starting with ""Paradise Girls"", a song that inverts its own premise. The title calls to mind women's bodies presented as set decoration for a steamy male utopia—ad copy for sleazy West Coast entertainment. Satomi Matsuzaki's lyrics counter that expectation by describing girls who make their very own paradise: ""Girls/ Who play the bass guitar...Girls/ Who are smart."" Rumbles of her bass mingle with John Dieterich's itchy guitar riffs and Greg Saunier's spacious drumbeats.</p>
<p><i>Breakup Songs</i> leaned heavily on anemic synthesizer sounds to round out its eerie, space-age profile, but with <i>La Isla Bonita</i>, Deerhoof sink back into punk rock's bare bones just to see how much they can crank out of them. With a purely organic template behind her, Matsuzaki's voice finds new pockets of space to fill, which helps her nail in her nonsensical lines even deeper. Run through the sour, bass-driven groove of ""Last Fad"" a few times, and you'll have no idea how the words ""Baseball is canceled/ it is running late"" keep getting stuck in your head. It doesn't matter—they're there. Matsuzaki slips them in so skillfully you'll want to adopt them as a catchphrase for when everything goes wrong: ""Fuck it! Baseball is canceled!""</p>
<p>The record's climax ""Black Pitch"" sweeps Deerhoof's tight patterns into a satisfying pop catharsis. It starts with something like a threat: ""We're gonna want you/ We're gonna want you/ We're gonna want you 24/7,"" Matsuzaki insists. The riffs behind her stay nervous; Saunier's drums shift and shake. And then the song crests. Matsuzaki sings over herself as if from far away, stretching her syllables until the backing drops out and it's just her and her own echoes, alone in the void.</p>
<p>A big part of Deerhoof's power comes from their inscrutability. They've got the rare talent of affecting emotion without supplying a direct line into any kind of inner narrative, of inspiring release in the abstract. <i>La Isla Bonita</i> doesn't solve any mysteries, but it does cut some new faces on a band that feeds on its own newness. </p></div>"|19917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19917-deerhoof-la-isla-bonita/|7.6|Sasha Geffen

<div><i>Money Sucks, Friends Rule</i> is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31590-dillon-francis/"" target=""_blank"">Dillon Francis</a>' first full-length after a string of EPs and singles that broke moombahton big (well, bigger) in the States. And while there've been glimpses of what he can pull off when he's not in his usual flippantly goofy mode, like the warm, oddly moving electro-house sleeper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15827-dillon-francis-without-you-ft-totally-enormous-extinct-dinosaurs/"" target=""_blank"">""Without You""</a>, this intended breakthrough album pushes him out to the wider world as the man that nuance forgot. He can put together crowdpleasing music that pushes all the right buttons at the right moments, and his lack of shame when it comes to giving his pop upbringing its due hints at the potential versatility of his status in a world where EDM is one of the few new ideas pop's stuck to recently. But it's hard to get to the core of what his music does and where its inspiration really comes from without his public persona's living-meme goofiness getting in the way. <br/><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">It happened to every youth-energy genre, and lowest-common-denominator EDM isn't immune, either: at some point, a major player in the music eventually mistakes stupidity for rebellion. Now making stupid shit isn't a crime in itself. Subversive idiocy in action is when Country Joe &amp; the Fish led Woodstock in a mass cheerleading effort to spell out the word ""FUCK"" before launching into their dark-humored, fatalist 'Nam-War hillbilly eyepoke ""I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag"". Not to bring it up as the fifty-thousandth example of attempting to prove how right-on the Baby Boom generation was or anything; </span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">It's just to note that <i>Money Sucks</i> has a track, ""What's That Spell?"", that lifts the ""gimme an F"" (and so on) from that cheer and is pretty much fine with leaving things there. We're at a point long after that word alone has seemed dangerous and long before we appear done with shipping soldiers overseas, so what's the point?</span></div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">With an edgy jokester's built-in defense mechanism (what're you, humorless?), coupled with his defiant belief that dropping a bunch of blatant pop crossovers into <i>Money Sucks</i> can still be a true-to-self move, it's almost like he's daring purists and tightasses to roll their eyes.</span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">But if that's a source of cred for his fanbase, it's going to have to make up for the cred lost with the album's directionless eclecticism. Never mind if it's a sellout or not—it's just a mess, and makes Francis' claim in </span><a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/videos/6266809/dillon-francis-talks-debut-album-money-sucks-friends-rule"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an early-October Billboard interview</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> that an album of wall-to-wall club songs ""is not going to be interesting to anyone"" look tone-deaf. Does Twista's land-speed-record schtick fail to hide how little he (or anyone) has to say about hater-callout VIP-section fellatio trawling? Does Panic! At the Disco's Brendon Urie try to Jim Steinman his way through histrionic nonsense and assembled Springsteen/Stooges lyric lifts on ""Love in the Middle of a Firefight""? Do the Presets sound like an emergency airlift from 2005's indie-electro heyday dropped into the blankest caricature of that style imaginable?</span></div>
</div>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There's still a fair amount of stuff that fits more of what you might expect from a Mad Decent hedonist. And that's fine if you don't mind both-kinds-of-dense faux-Arabian rich-kid twerkbait (DJ Snake collab ""Get Low"", which won't make you forget either 2003 or 2013 Lil Jon), grating vocal chops that careen through dizzying pitch shifts (""I Can't Take It""), and an overwhelming reliance on building machine-gun crescendo/underwhelming drop structures that are five minutes from becoming the decade's big musical self-parody moment.

Those words may be true for guest vocalists Charmaine Baines and Lauren Faulkner, but it'd definitely be a stretch to call Dean Meredith and Ben Shenton ""New York City men."" And that disconnect, of course, is part of the great charm of the Mind Fair project, in which two Brits do their damnedest to pass as Americans. And not just any Americans, but Downtown disco denizens of the 1980s—with a ragged Woodstock freak flag dangling from their back pockets, for good measure.</p>
<p>A quarter-century ago, Meredith was a member of Bizarre Inc., a British acid house act that briefly served as an intermediary between the rave scene and the pop charts. Since then, he has spent most of his career pushing in the opposite direction—not following electronic music's progress into the future so much as burrowing back towards a mythical, prelapsarian moment, pre-rave culture, when disco and electronics and dub collided for the first time. If the search for the wellspring of soulful electronic dance music is something of a fool's errand, perhaps that explains why he's come at it from so many angles: the dubbed-out disco of his group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/904-chicken-lips/"">Chicken Lips</a>; the even dubbier, On-U-influenced Big Two Hundred; the Italo-flavored White Light Circus; and a dozen other bands and aliases, many with the same small handful of associates, like Andrew Meecham, Steve Kotey, and Ben Shenton.</p>
<p>In the past three years, Mind Fair have released nearly a dozen singles or EPs of woozy, nostalgic dance music, post-disco and proto-house. They established the outlines of their sound on their very first single: at one end, the loosey-goosey disco of ""Kerry's Scene"", complete with copious piano riffing and live electric bass; at the other end, the unplugged, back-porch blues of ""Mind Fair"", complete with harmonica and acoustic guitar. With <i>Mind Fair</i>, their debut album, they dial up the rock quotient and really let their hair down. The album sounds like the product of a week locked in someone's apartment, fueled by tequila and mushrooms, and while it's unclear exactly who did what—along with their own machines and electric bass, the album credits a handful of musicians for percussion, ukulele, and vocals—it scans as a joyful ruckus, a communal frenzy.</p>
<p>After an introduction of organ grind and fun-fair clang, they dive straight into the fray with ""Green Fingers"", a pulse-raising fusion of late-'70s disco/rap percussion—extra-dry drum-machine patterns overlaid with rolling congas—and searing acid rock guitars. It's reminiscent of Big Audio Dynamite and, even more so, James Blood Ulmer's 1984 single ""Eye Level"", in which the jazz/funk/blues guitarist was accompanied by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9376-the-pop-group/"">the Pop Group</a> drummer Bruce Smith and On-U producer Adrian Sherwood. ""So Morose"" is another blues-heavy number, this time with a far cleaner hook and a one-note bassline, plus some organ riffing in the background. It's one of the album's most focused grooves, and one of its best, with a real first-thought-best-thought immediacy to it. Venturing further out, ""Deutsche Bag"" drizzles tautly plucked guitar and a misty layer of Frippertronics over declarative tuned toms, with distant chants and the odd splash of organ adding faint tone color. As it goes on, the tonal center just disappears. It's not often you find a club track that's so unafraid to go for broke. Depending on the dosage in the punch, it's not hard to imagine it reducing the dancefloor to a writhing mass, naked and speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>Given the jam-oriented structures and the limited tonal palette, one's appreciation for the record will have a lot to do with one's predisposition for bluesy electric guitar over shuddering drum machines. ""Cursed"" repurposes the trills of Cymande's ""Bra"" over a ""Rapper's Delight""-inspired break and piles on ukulele and harmonica; ""U Got the Lovin'"" adds some flute to the mix. But there's enough variety to keep things interesting. ""Voodoo Train"", with its wordless chants and grunts and mewls over oodles of rolling hand percussion, evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell"">Arthur Russell</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/251-matias-aguayo/"">Matias Aguayo</a>. ""Neon Carnival"", with its clean-lined synth arpeggios and clipped sax bleats, revisits Chicken Lips' groove-heavy stomping ground. ""Mushroom Blues""—the title is pretty much a dead giveaway—rolls out the acid-rock guitars over a ""Wax the Van""-style groove, pretty much as good a way to close the album as any. Before that, the bass-and-guitar counterpoints of ""Find Me at the Fair"" sound a hell of a lot like Minutemen, and when's the last time you could say you heard <i>their </i>influence in a dance record?</p>
<p>The one thing that feels missing is a proper singer. Despite the presence of four credited vocalists, those vocals never play a central role—which is fine. But given the jammy, freeform qualities of their playing, Mind Fair could stand to have the occasional element to pull it all together. The melodic hook was what made ""Take Me to the Bridge"" so indelible. But give 'em time; theirs is a New York of the mind, rent-controlled and immune to gentrification. Nobody's going to be forcing them out any time soon.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p></div>"|19883.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19883-mind-fair-mind-fair/|7.0|Philip Sherburne

Since 2011, the solo recordings of the Brazilian-born composer and producer, a Berklee graduate and sometimes death-metal drummer, have been concerned primarily with the expressive potential of synthesizers.<i> Progress Chance</i>, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17241-assimilating-the-shadow/"" target=""_blank"">Assimilating the Shadow</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18745-ricardo-donoso-as-iron-sharpens-iron-one-verse-sharpens-anther/"" target=""_blank""></a></i>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18745-ricardo-donoso-as-iron-sharpens-iron-one-verse-sharpens-anther/"" target=""_blank""><i>As Iron Sharpens Iron, One Verse Sharpens Another</i> </a>brim with quicksilver frequencies, gravelly formants, and shimmering, mirage-like washes of tone. Sometimes his sounds are reminiscent of physical instruments like pipe organs; more often, they feel like signals picked up by a radio telescope, or pure electricity poured through a sieve.</p>
<p>Those records were just as concerned with the expressive potential of sequencers—hardware devices, and sometimes virtual instruments, used for triggering arpeggiated patterns of notes as well as the filters and effects that color them. Reduced to simple contrapuntal phrases, Donoso's sequences came across like glistening series of dewdrops arrayed across spiders' webs vibrating in midair. Shorn of the drums that would scan as ""techno,"" they felt less like dance music and more like perpetual motion machines. Earlier this year, with <i>Nitrogen Narcosis</i>, released under his Scuba Death alias on Seattle's Further label, he delved more explicitly into dancefloor aesthetics—albeit slowed down by half and still almost percussion-free, save for a dull kick drum buried deep in the mix. But here, on the inaugural release for his own Kathexis label, he switches up his process, eschewing the safety net of repetitive beats and expanding his palette to include a wealth of electro-acoustic material of uncertain provenance.</p>
<p>Divided into seven roman-numeraled parts, the 29-minute album feels very much like a film score; it proceeds seamlessly from one segment to the next, and it's heavy on atmosphere but light on song-like structure. And, in fact, it <i>is</i> a film score; Donoso's music is the accompaniment to <a href=""http://www.julienymann.com/A-Song-For-Echo-2013"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Julie Nymann's film of the same name</a>, a re-telling of the Echo and Narcissus myth created specifically for a 360-degree surround-image projection in the Boston Museum of Science's Charles Hayden Planetarium. That immersive dimension helps contextualize the music's slow, shifting movements.</p>
<p>The album opens with resonant drones reminiscent of Seefeel's <i>Succour</i>; bells and plucked-metal synthesizers chime against a backdrop that might be airplanes buzzing high overhead. A thudding pulse lends a hint of dub techno; midrange arpeggios, echoing Monolake's carefully sculpted arrangements, flash like goldfish darting through muddy ponds. It's occasionally reminiscent of Vladislav Delay's early, abstracted work; the massing drones and bowed bass and scraping sheets of metal also suggest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31030-the-haxan-cloak/"" target=""_blank"">the Haxan Cloak</a>'s waxy horror. As the album proceeds, it builds into something almost overpowering—an enormous basso throb accompanied by the grating sound of knives being sharpened, metal gates swinging back and forth in the wind; swollen reverb sings the wind-tunnel blues. And then, like a storm passing overhead, it all fades to silence.</p>
<p>Speaking to Marc Masters and Grayson Currin for their column <a href=""http://the-out-door.tumblr.com/post/101677189170/200-words-ricardo-donoso"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Out Door</i></a>, Donoso described <i>A Song for Echo</i> as ""a springboard,"" noting, ""all the ideas on it are still very much segregated, naked &amp; exposed—much like <i>Progress Chance</i> was. Slowly, over the next few releases—these building blocks will evolve into much deeper &amp; developed structures."" There's plenty of room for him to develop the ideas broached here; rhythmically and texturally, <i>A Song for Echo</i> sounds like he's just beginning to blaze a trail that leads beyond the limits of the Digitalis trilogy. But it's exciting to hear Donoso reconnecting, however tentatively, with the intensity of his metal band, Ehnahre. If <i>Echo</i> is the sound of stormclouds massing, perhaps the deluge is just around the corner.<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> </span></p></div>"|19882.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19882-ricardo-donoso-a-song-for-echo/|7.5|Philip Sherburne

We’ve known for a while that Mark Kozelek was going to be releasing a Christmas album before the end of the year, but for much of that time Kozelek was riding a wave of goodwill following the release of (the still very good, even if I’ve stopped bringing it up at parties) <i>Benji</i>. Now <i>Sings Christmas Carols</i> finally comes out and it feels like an unwanted present from the obnoxious uncle you try and avoid at family gatherings. What happened in between? Kozelek saw the reaction he got from a typically cranky and offhand comment about War on Drugs’ music bleeding into his own at a festival and somehow thought releasing not one but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56989-here-it-is-mark-kozeleks-song-called-war-on-drugs-suck-my-cock/""><i>two</i></a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56989-here-it-is-mark-kozeleks-song-called-war-on-drugs-suck-my-cock/"">songs</a> about it a would be amusing to someone other than himself (plus a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56628-mark-kozeleks-label-selling-all-you-fuckin-hillbillies-shut-the-fuck-up-t-shirt/"">t-shirt</a> with another insult). Suffice to say the joke isn’t funny anymore, and Kozelek is looking pretty sad, not to mention that he’s probably alienating new fans he may have acquired since <i>Benji</i>’s release. And now we’re supposed to allow him into our homes and into Mom and Dad’s 5xCD changer, slotting his CD next to Dolly Parton and Nat King Cole and <i>A Charlie Brown Christmas</i>? If nothing else, we can be thankful that Kozelek finished this album some time ago, so he didn’t alter his version of “The Christmas Song” to include the line “Although it’s been said, many times, many ways, War on Drugs can…”</p>
<p>Anyway. If you can listen to <i>Sings Christmas Carols</i> and think, “This too shall pass,” knowing that by Christmas 2015 Kozelek will have become bored of this game and we’ll have moved on to the next internet beef, you may well enjoy this one. There’s no doubt Kozelek has a voice suited to the material, that he comes up with solid guitar arrangements, and generally imbues these songs with a sense of calm and contemplation. This is by and large a traditional Christmas album all the way, something that you <i>could</i> play for your parents and have them say, “Hey, that’s better than the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RW7IZBUMc8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">weird one</a> you brought last year.” He layers his voice into a mini choir for the a capella on “O Come All Ye Faithful”, throws a funny spoken word interlude into “Christmas Time Is Here” that pokes fun at his sad-sack persona, and includes an overlooked Christmas-themed song into the mix, the Pretenders’ “2000 Miles”, which really should be a standard. It’s just voice and guitar throughout, but Kozelek’s nylon string work is consistently engaging, even as he falls back on some of his go-to fingerpicking patterns.</p>
<p>But the album’s strengths—the relaxed vibe, easy prettiness, and earthy undercurrent, all appropriate for a bloated eggnog buzz—happen to be qualities Kozelek can conjure at will. He has a weird way with covers; he can make any song sound like a Kozelek song, but that’s a double-edged sword. When he tackles someone else’s music it almost always <i>sounds</i> good, but there is rarely any depth, and the actual content can seem irrelevant. Two previous covers collections, the AC/DC set <i>What’s Next to the Moon</i> and <i>Tiny Cities</i>, featuring Modest Mouse songs, were more about domination than interpretation. Kozelek smothers the songs in his own aesthetic, and the same holds true here. The main differences being, Christmas songs lend themselves well to his particular concerns, and not too many people are thinking about the deeper layers of meaning inside “O Christmas Tree”. Is it going to bump Low’s <i>Christmas</i> out of the rotation? Not likely. But it’s not bad, and it very well may sound better with each passing year.</p></div>"|19932.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19932-mark-kozelek-sings-christmas-carols/|6.8|Mark Richardson

But when it came time to record “My Curse”, one of the darkest moments on the album, he didn’t think he had it in him. “I tried to sing it, but it was kinda really impossible for me to do,” he told <i><a href=""http://www.summerskiss.com/tspress/gd_loose_lips_interview.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Loose Lips Sink Ships</a></i> back in 2005. “It was too close to the bone. Basically I chickened out.” That’s a remarkable thing to contemplate: This is, after all, an album that serves as an emotional exorcism, visceral and violent, played by a band not known for its squeamishness. Rather than tackle the song himself, Dulli enlisted Marcy Mays of the Columbus, Ohio, band Scrawl, and she sings the absolute hell out of it. Her slurred, scrawled vocals are tough-minded and defiant one moment, freshly bruised and broken the next, as she treads the tightrope between temptation and repulsion, between pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>“Curse softly to me, baby, and smother me in your love,” she all but begs, as though she must summon the courage to get each syllable out of her mouth. “Temptation comes not from hell but from above.” It is, to say the least, a powerful moment, but it also fulfills an important narrative function: If <i>Gentlemen</i> documents the demise of a romance, then “My Curse” allows the woman to tell her own side of the story, to call out the posturing in Dulli’s hyper-masculine lyrics, to express explicitly the pain he is inflicting on her. Offering a new perspective on the album’s brutal sexual politics, Mays reveals his outsize persona to be a ruse: a defense mechanism with which he can refract emotions too dark and messy and traumatic to face head on.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s why the album still sounds so vital and so fresh 21 years on. Removed from the alt-rock boom of the early '90s, <i>Gentlemen</i> is both personal and unknowable, cocksure yet deeply troubled—in other words, so complicated and contradictory that we’re still trying to untangle its knots. <i>Gentlemen at 21</i> offers some fresh insights into this song cycle, but fortunately doesn’t remaster or repackage the mystery out of it. The album sounds sharper and a bit more dangerous, those coiled guitars riffs more potent and Steve Earle’s drums wilder and more insistent. And the bonus demos and covers reveal the DNA of the album, signaling not only the rock and R&amp;B sources that inspired Dulli, but also giving some insight into the band’s creative process before they trekked down to Ardent Studio in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>
<p>Memphis figures prominently on <i>Gentlemen</i>, even if the album opens with the buzz of car wheels on the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge in the band’s hometown of Cincinnati. The Afghan Whigs had long been incorporating the sounds and fashions of black soul, funk, and jazz into their buzzy indie rock, which lent previous albums like 1990’s <i>Up in It </i>and 1992’s <i>Congregation</i> a sense of taut rhythmic urgency. The band had previously covered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5771-al-green/"">Al Green</a>’s “Beware” and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22874-elvis-presley/"">Elvis</a> hit “True Love Travels on a Gravel Road”, and they chose Tyrone Davis’ “I Keep Coming Back” for <i>Gentlemen, </i>proving their well of influences went much deeper than the usual alt-rock fare. While their contemporaries drew from indie bands like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3517-the-raincoats/"">Raincoats</a> and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2725-meat-puppets/"">Meat Puppets</a> or from classic rock acts like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4592-the-who/"">Who</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>, Dulli was much more interested in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=stax"">Stax</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=complete+motown+singles"">Motown</a>, in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2707-curtis-mayfield/"">Curtis Mayfield</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2054-isaac-hayes/"">Isaac Hayes</a>.</p>
<p>On later albums, these sources would become much more obvious, but on <i>Gentlemen</i> they are buried in the mix, evident in the strangled riffs on the title track and in the sensual drift of “When We Two Parted”. Drummer Steve Earle is crucial to this balance of styles and sounds, keeping time as tight as the great <a href=""http://youtu.be/kzlftJnGwvY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Al Jackson Jr.</a> but adding the fills and frills of showy rock drummers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14623-keith-moon/"">Keith Moon</a>. (Sadly, this would be Earle’s final album with the band.) In this regard, the covers included with <i>Gentlemen at 21 </i>prove more substantial than your typical bonus material, not only providing a blueprint for the Afghan Whigs’ sound but also providing a sort of mixtape for the characters involved. It’s not hard to imagine Dulli’s narrator blasting the Ass Ponys’ “Mr. Superlove” for inspiration, or tempting a lover with Dan Penn’s “The Dark End of the Street”, or consoling himself with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11827-the-supremes/"">Supremes</a>’ “My World Is Empty Without You”.</p>
<p>Over two decades <i>Gentleman</i> has most often been described as a “song cycle,” a term that distinguishes it from a concept album or a narrative album (although both terms are to some degree applicable). If that idea persists, perhaps its due to the word “cycle,” which seems apt: <i>Gentlemen </i>ends more or less where it begins. Scene-setting overture “If I Were Going” opens the album with a slow fade-in finally interrupted by Earle’s stop-start drumbeat, and “Brother Woodrow/Closing Prayer” closes the affair with a long, cinematic fade-out, with a dissonant cello echoing the migraine drone of the Roebling Bridge. The sequencing shapes the album beautifully, creating a sense of emotional fatigue while only hinting vaguely at redemption. Thematically, however, that cycle implies a romantic fatalism, as though every relationship is doomed to end painfully.</p>
<p>That’s what makes <i>Gentlemen at 21</i> such a compelling and necessary reissue, even if the album has never been terribly hard to find. Living with this record, whether for a few weeks or a few decades, only repeats the pattern and makes the songs sound increasingly, almost unbearably desperate. That urgency has not softened over time or even with the addition of bonus material. The early versions of these songs, recorded at Ultrasuede Studio in Cincinnati, show just how little they changed at Ardent, although it’s unclear whether they burst out of Dulli’s brain fully formed or the band sharpened them. Perhaps the most intriguing bonus track is the Ultrasuede version of “My Curse”, with Dulli singing lead. He toys with pitch and meter like a man with more to say than his voice can convey, but he’s more engaged with the material than he sounds on later bootlegs like <i>Time for a Bavarian Death Waltz.</i> In fact, he sounds relatively timid, perhaps even beaten, exhausted, raw, lowdown—as though he no longer possesses the hope or the courage to keep the cycle going. In a way, chickening out may be the boldest thing he ever did. </p></div>"|19885.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19885-the-afghan-whigs-gentlemen-at-21/|8.7|Stephen M. Deusner

<p>But what’s even the point of feigning outrage anymore, we’re celebrating the 20th anniversary of a year when Candlebox and Live were successfully marketed as an alternative to <i>anything</i>—this is just the 21st century version of selling the drama. But we need to talk about <i>something</i> when we talk about <i>HAERTS</i> and more interesting than their anodyne music is this central paradox<span>—</span>it’s easy to think of thousands of people liking HAERTS and extremely difficult to explain how a single person could love them.</p>
<p>They’re hardly alone in this aspect; they’re not so much a part of a wave than a crest between the retrospectively game-changing, idiosyncratic, helium-voiced future-prog of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26765-passion-pit"">Passion Pit </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt"">MGMT </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30747-chvrches"">Chvrches</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim"">Haim</a>'s merger of modernist, personable warmth and fashion mag gloss. HAERTS are indicative of the functional bands that currently fill the rosters of quasi-indies like Downtown, Vagrant, Glassnote, and Neon Gold, and functionality is enhanced by interchangeability<span>—</span>these are usually co-ed groups that look European but sound American (or vice versa), their picture gives you no immediate sense of who does what, on stage they’re structured like rock bands but don’t really put guitars at the center, so let’s just split the difference and call it “indie pop.” And this <i>is</i> the sound of “indie pop” in 2013 and, no that’s not a typo. It’s not just the stylization of HAERTS’ name that already seems dated.</p>
<p>So what does HAERTS give you that Wildcat! Wildcat!, Strange Talk, or their virtual twin St. Lucia (whose Jean-Philip Grobler produces) doesn’t? The main difference is that they’re even more willing to be serviceable towards some unknown, greater purpose. HAERTS aren’t much for sloppy emotions, edge, or humor; while Nini Fabi is occasionally given a booster from an unseen cheerleading chorus, she’s so earnest, so committed to staying out of the way of big hooks, she’s more akin to a middle manager than a frontwoman.</p>
<p>A scroll through <i>HAERTS</i>’ tracklist reveals some serious truth in advertising: “Giving Up”, “Wings”, “Lights Out”, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16790-call-my-name/"">“Call My Name</a>”, “All the Days”. The sentiments are so vague that the placeholder titles offer no assistance in helping you remember which one does the <i>Tango in the Night</i>, which one shines like a midnight sun over <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12263-midnight-city"">“Midnight City”</a>, which one does a shuffling, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10351-chairlift"">Chairlift</a>-like ascension, and which one (or several) have the same DNA as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14299-the-mother-we-share"">“The Mother We Share”</a>.</p>
<p>That said, throw <i>HAERTS</i> on shuffle and it’s uniformly accessible and uniform, period. You will hear a glimmering song about heartbreak that also sounds vaguely motivational. Quote any random lyric and it will also speak of heartbreak while sounding vaguely motivational. Do some WebMD research if you must before encountering “Hemiplegia”; its symptoms sound as mundane and relatable as those of the common cold, no matter how much Fabi tries to impart meaning via repetition to  “No you can’t move up with your eyes down.” “Giving Up” echoes the unapologetic breakup austerity of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15784-haim-the-wire"">“The Wire”</a>, but keeps its eye on the ball rather than fumbling, which is a problem when a hook like, “I’m giving up/ You say it’s now or never/ I’m giving up/ In time it’s for the better” needs some semblance of human error to resonate.   </p>
<p>So, the supposed paradox of HAERTS is actually fairly easy to explain<span>—</span>bands of their ilk respect the craft that goes into pop music and aren’t shy about emulating its crisp, moneyed sound. They’re just shy about risking self-disclosure, anything personal that could be extrapolated into <i>personality</i>. Fabi may have experienced every single thing she sings about here, but you never get a sense of who she actually is or how it felt. Even if <i>HAERTS</i>’ hooks sound like slam dunks in a vacuum, they remind you of arguments as to why the NBA Slam Dunk Contest has become increasingly obsolescent<span>—</span>at this point, it’s just 80s and 90s nostalgia, there’s no room for innovation, no charisma and, most importantly, no realistic context to give it meaning.</p></div>"|19960.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19960-haerts-haerts/|5.8|Ian Cohen

No matter how deep you dig, there are only so many fuzzy riffs and analog synth squelches that can possibly be exhumed from the 1960s and '70s. If only for this reason, Cave have a purpose in the world.</p>
<p>Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31611-bitchin-bajas/"">Bitchin Bajas</a>, their <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drag City</a> labelmates (with whom they share members Rob Frye and Cooper Crain), the Chicago-based quintet do their best to expand the world’s limited supply of old-school zone-out sounds. The Bajas’ work pays tribute to the spacey and meditative tones of early minimalist composition and new age music. Cave’s music takes heavy influence from the gritty and repetitive sounds of krautrock and obscure global psychedelic music. Very often, both bands' efforts provide a superior experience to the steady stream of era-appropriate reissues with which they must compete. After all, they have the benefit of hindsight. Cave can deliver all of the good stuff—the hypnotic grooves, the cosmic atmospheres—with less of the yodeling.</p>
<p><i>Release</i> collects out-of-print material from a number of the band’s non-album singles, cassettes, and limited edition CD-Rs—originally released on labels like Trensmat, Static Caravan and Important—onto one LP, with the earliest material stretching back to 2007.</p>
<p>On its most recent full-length, <i>Threace</i>, Cave refined their approach and stripped down their sound with great results. Where some of the band’s earlier work sometimes sounded as if it had been haphazardly jammed into existence, songs like ""Shikaakwa"" and ""Slow Bern"" were elegant and tightly focused, getting maximum mileage out of minimal melodic information. Like the music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"">Neu!</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>, Cave’s songs implied motion and stasis simultaneously through the use of repetition.</p>
<p>The music on <i>Release</i> is a little rougher around the edges, but don’t interpret that as ""worse."" Some of the tracks included here stand above the LP cuts the band was releasing at the time. They’re looser, but also grittier and headier. ""Bobby’s Hash"" showcases Cave at its heaviest, with screeching guitar solos and pummeling, distorted drums. It’s well executed, but free and freaky abandon isn’t necessarily the band’s strongest position. Unlike their pysch-rock revivalist forebears, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/805-comets-on-fire/"">Comets on Fire</a>—who lived and died by glorious freewheeling and freaky guitar solos—Cave’s music is most distinctive when the band is exercising restraint. On ""Butthash (Harsh Mellow Mix)"" Cave slowly expands upon a fuzzy, cyclical guitar riff, gradually fading in synth murmurs and additional percussion. Both drawn from the same 2012 single, ""Party Legs"" and ""Thai I Am"" find the band moving toward the more economical sound they would employ on <i>Threace</i>, switching from a hypnotic improvisation to more tightly structured compositions.</p>
<p><i>Release </i>is not Cave’s strongest record, but it’s not a bad entry point. An odds and ends compilation, it provides a clear picture of the group's evolution from free-form psych-noodling toward its more sublime and trance-inducing current incarnation.</p></div>"|19773.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19773-cave-release/|6.6|Aaron Leitko

They seem, in large part, a relic of the 1990s electronica boom, a time when CDs were plentiful and well-funded major labels were trying to figure out how exactly to best peddle funky bleeps and bloops to a wider record-buying public. Remixes are still used as a way to boost the visibility of a young artist via a more famous remixer, or to expand a track's reach by dressing it up in a different genre, but it's more common these days to offer the material as a carrot for purchasing from a particular vendor or as a freebie to drum up interest. Underground labels, as always, seem content to issue mixes on vinyl, for DJs and collectors. So the market isn't exactly saturated, which is fine: it was always a slightly dicey proposition to bundle together re-imaginings by a disparate group of artists.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31736-livity-sound/"">Livity Sound</a> is a small, Bristol-based label/collective whose curious meld of techno, dub, and bass music proved popular with the type of progressive, underground-leaning DJs. They were notable for their sound, but also for the insular nature with which is was presented: tribal markings (<a href=""http://punchdrunkmusic.com/2013/10/29/a-statement-about-livity-sound-and-its-artwork/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">since abandoned</a>), monochrome labels, and singles that featured different combinations of the three members (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22787-peverelist/"">Peverelist</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31347-kowton/"">Kowton</a>, <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/1451990-Asusu"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Asusu</a>) but no outsiders. Watching them <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1993"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">conjure the sound live</a> revealed a sense of ritual.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With just nine (original) releases to their name—and none since they collected them on last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18622-livity-sound-livity-sound/"" target=""_blank"">excellent eponymous album</a>—they might seem an unlikely mark for an album of Sumixes. But Livity's sound represents something of an ideal for remixers: potent and distinct enough to survive mangling but with plenty of cavities and null spaces to explore. The sound, so deep-seated in the trio, would best be expanded by a group of peers and sympathizers.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The list of remixers is heavy on European veterans, and while the names aren't big—UK techno don <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4004-surgeon/"">Surgeon</a> represents the loudest choice—they're an imaginative group that share Livity's propensity for manically controlled aggression and tense rhythms. The remixers favor tweaks and refurbishments to outright deconstruction, so <i>Livity Sound Remixes</i> is still largely a hard charging collection of throbbing bass and ratcheting snares, albeit a collection that feels slightly less isolated as the familiar clang of techno and curves of house are sprinkled over the tracks like seasoning.</p>
<p>There are some striking updates. Tessela takes the nimble breakbeat of Pev's ""Aztec Chant"" and plates it in chrome; Ghost-202 (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31758-ron-morelli/"">Ron Morelli</a> and Svengalighost) pervert ""Livity""'s bassline into a snarling, distorted mess. Surgeon takes the halting rhythm of ""Raw Code"" and sets it like a broken bone, offering rigidity and support. Berlin's Nick Höppner turns in one of the best mixes, unearthing softness and patience in the quicksilver house of Asusu's ""Sister"".

<p dir=""ltr"">There are times when austerity gets the better of Livity's sound, like when MM/KM (Mix Mup and Kassem Mosse) remove titular, wiggling synth melody, one of Livity's rare playful moments, from Kowton's ""More Games"". And while the lack of total teardowns by the remixers speaks to the resiliency of the original tracks, <i>Livity Sound Remixes</i> is lacking in true curveballs (something that was less apparent when these tracks were released separately over the course of the year). Still, <i>Livity Sound Remixes</i> serves as a welcome addendum to some of the most vital club music of recent years and a roadmap for placing this flinty, penetrating music into a broader context.</p></div>"|19796.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19796-various-artists-livity-sound-remixes/|7.4|Andrew Gaerig

The record also let in influences that were not yet entirely indie-approved, such as dance music on ""Tiny Cities Made of Ashes"". Morbid lyrics and backmasked guitars notwithstanding, ""Gravity Rides Everything"" was catchy enough to sell Nissan Quest minivans. <i>Moon</i>, though clearly a classic now, caused debates over whether Modest Mouse had ""sold out,"" something people still earnestly fretted about as the Internet was upsetting old hierarchies.</p>
<p>This commercial openness was quite a shift for a band defined by a sense of isolation in its own secret world. The Modest Mouse of the '90s had also been very much of its time, when indie rock was less of a popular genre than a refuge from them. Weird bands from nowhere places strained their quirks through a punk filter, and their styles were narrower but, perhaps, deeper than those of their polyglot descendants. Modest Mouse fit the mold. Formed by singer and guitarist Isaac Brock, drummer Jeremiah Green, and bassist Eric Judy in the Washington suburb of Issaquah, they had a kind of insular, visionary oddness.</p>
<p>Modest Mouse quickly found purchase in the Pacific Northwest scene. In 1994, they made their first EP with Calvin Johnson in Olympia for his twee-punk label K Records, as well as a single for Seattle's Sub Pop. They also recorded the album <i>Sad Sappy Sucker</i>, which sat on the shelf until 2001, when it did indeed turn out to be their most K-style record—bright, baggy, and loose at the seams. During this time they veered off into a wilderness of their own devising, debuting with the darker and tauter <i>This Is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing to Think About</i> on Up Records in 1996. That and their second Up album, 1997's <i>The Lonesome Crowded West</i>, have just been reissued by Brock's Glacial Pace label. Both are excellent, but it's the more fully formed <i>Lonesome</i> that consummates an era.</p>
<p>From the start, Modest Mouse were instantly recognizable: Judy's ropy bass and Green's drumming, heaving from a caveman bash to a disco skip, are indispensable to the rangy, volatile sound. But it's the guitars that really define it, so strange and particular—Brock's hearty riffs, string bends, harmonics, and whammy-bar tremolo push up toward trebly extremes of panicked intensity. The songs break down into wheezes and coughs as the band pounds the ends of bars until they curl up like sheet metal. </p>
<p>But they weren't completely <i>ex nihilo</i>. Like other '90s indie groups, Modest Mouse reflected their region before pulling free from it on later albums. There's grunge in the whisper-scream dynamics here, metal and punk in sections of breakneck thrash, twee in the richly jangling acoustic guitars and in Brock's voice, always petulant and pleading. There are also outlying indie touchstones—""Might"" sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill/"">Built to Spill</a> if someone had knocked <span>Doug Martsch on </span>the head, other songs evoke <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"">the Pixies</a> by way of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a>. Even alt-rock is absorbed in the patchwork pop of ""Lounge"", a medley of surf-rock, hot jazz, and chamber music with shout-rapped lyrics. But Modest Mouse were already fortifying their hermetic island on <i>Long Drive</i>, where they pitted the jarring against the lulling in diverse ways.</p>
<p>The great theme of both albums is travel, or more essentially, how motion through space feels. This is also intricately bound up with the physical geography Modest Mouse inhabited. The urban paranoia of post-punk seeps into wide-open rural, looming industrial and encroaching suburban vistas, all alike in their sinister, hypnotic repetition. With the first words of <i>Long Drive</i>, ""traveling swallowing Dramamine,"" a sense of drugged conveyance through some grand monotony settles over us. We seem to glimpse empty landscapes with twisty bits of things blowing through them in the window of a train. Strip malls and parking lots, monuments and steeples, empty fields and dark forests scroll by in a purgatorial loop. This becomes overt on ""Convenient Parking"", a dusty practice riff with broken springs.</p>
<p>For Brock, these enclosing physical confines are tantamount to mental ones; he's always moving forward without getting anywhere different, and he confronts this existential emergency with disdain and terrified awe. The music cultivates its particular urgency by devising and then breaking free from psychic traps. ""From the top of the ocean/ From the bottom of the sky/ Well, I get claustrophobic,"" Brock bellows on <i>Lonesome</i>'s ""Teeth Like God's Shoeshine"", an image that would return in different form a few years later on ""Ocean Breathes Salty"". The earth and heavens are not mediums but inescapable masses, crushing us in the seam where they meet. The feeling of being stuck in a small town inflates to cosmological proportions.</p>
<p>Home-schooled in religious hippie communes, Brock was primed for this visionary vocation. His lyrics are marked by a war between militant atheism and kind of crypto-Christian mysticism, a tension that twists his perspective into strange shapes. On these records, the pavement is steadily encroaching on the wild in ways that feel spiritually symbolic. Brock wants to wrench apart ground and sky, prefabricated towns and consumer culture, to find an exit hatch into some deeper, more meaningful state of being which, as he suspects on ""Exit Does Not Exist"", is a fantasy.</p>
<p>Modest Mouse never captured their particular rural paranoia better than on <i>Lonesome</i>'s ""Cowboy Dan"", a minor key dirge that takes us to a jet-black desert rustling below the occasional shooting star. It's a folkloric tale of a cowboy who tries to shoot down God as revenge for mortality, with eerie calls and groans floating out of a vast, breathing darkness. ""I didn't move to the city, the city moved to me,"" he cries, via Brock's rabid goblin croak, ""and I want out desperately,"" a theme that first began to develop on<i> Long Drive</i>'s ""Beach Side Property"".</p>
<p>It's all about inverted insides and outsides: huge landscapes that feel like small cages, civilizations that breed a savage misanthropy, disbelief that feels like religion. ""Doin' the Cockroach"" begins with the elusive dichotomy, ""I was in heaven, I was in Hell/ Believe in neither but fear them as well."" Brock excoriates riders on the Amtrak for ""talking 'bout TV,"" punctuating his condemnations with pleas to ""please shut up."" He also slips in one of the best of the obscure aphorisms that would come to increasingly infiltrate his litany of complaints: Some number of years ""down the road in your life, you'll look in the mirror and say, 'My parents are still alive.'"" I <i>think</i> it's about getting older, but it's open to numberless interpretations, all of them with the indescribable ambient menace of a bad dream.</p>
<p><i>The Lonesome Crowded West </i>fine-tunes forms that were introduced on <i>Long Drive</i>. ""Teeth Like God's Shoeshine"" and the sprawling ""Trucker's Atlas"" draw the erratic thrust of ""Breakthrough"" into sleeker, more commanding arcs. ""Lounge (Closing Time)"" is a less novelty-based, more structurally balanced version of ""Lounge"". And ""Shit Luck"" is even more potent than""Tundra/Desert"", with two-note power chords growling up and down the neck in breakneck syncopation with wailing string bends. The record also refines some new looks that would soon be developed, such as the scratchy rural funk jam of ""Jesus Christ Was an Only Child"" and tender, ringing ballads such as ""Heart Cooks Brain"" and the gentle confessional ""Trailer Trash"".  </p>
<p>With <i>Moon</i>, Modest Mouse caught a new wave of spacey psych-pop alongside the likes of The Flaming Lips, and it let them out on a foreign shore: mainstream success. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5363-good-news-for-people-who-love-bad-news/""><i>Good News for People Who Love Bad News</i></a> (2004) went platinum, produced hit single ""Float On"", landed the band on <i>SNL</i> and earned a Grammy nomination. To me, that was the last real Modest Mouse album—and even it was on the verge—as the personalities that made the group unique got diluted by new personnel, i.e., someone as externally defined as Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10010-we-were-dead-before-the-ship-even-sank/""><i>We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank</i></a> (2007) was the band's first number one album, but it felt like an ending, and only an EP of leftovers from the last two albums has emerged since. </p>
<p><i>Lonesome</i> came out right on the hinge between indie rock's regional phase and its global one, in 1997, the year I got my first email address, and I still have the original LP I bought around then. Listening to albums you loved that long ago often feels like looking at old photos, but the remarkable thing about these reissues is that their thrill feels contemporary, a present sense of physical and psychological danger. Indeed, something you notice in an almost manically retro indie music climate is a striking absence of nostalgia. Things are fucked <i>now</i>, with no inkling that they were ever any better, no state of grace to return to.</p>
<p>The end of the '90s were packed with epochal last gasps of pre-Internet indie rock that came out just as Radiohead's <i>OK Computer</i> was becoming the avatar of the next, more mainstream phase.

You can see it in his tweets, which knowingly combine the <a href=""https://twitter.com/tbhjuststop"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sad teenager</a> aesthetic with that of the <a href=""https://twitter.com/ryanhemsworth/status/517760114158469120"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">semi-ironic, in-crowd broducer.</a> You can see it in his <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/shhsecretsongs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Secret Songs record club,</a> through which he's cultivated a community of bedroom producers in his likeness and given them access to a large audience. And you can see it on the guest list for his new album, <i>Alone for the First Time,</i> which, despite its name, features contributions from popular Soundcloud artists and Secret Songs amateurs alike. But even if it’s not literal, the title does justice to the major artistic step that this album represents. For better and for worse, this is the Halifax producer’s boldest aesthetic statement to date, and taking that kind of risk must feel something like striking out on your own for the first time.</p>
<p>Hemsworth started his career playing two distinct roles. He produced songs for minor, buzzing Southern rappers riding the cloud-rap wave and remixed the pop songs of the moment, tricking them out with candy-colored synths and creaky drum machines. He was already about as collaborative as it’s possible to be: most of his work either featured someone else rapping or was a rework of a song that had been created by someone else entirely. But even his original tracks felt like the work of a producer who wasn’t yet sure what kind of music he wanted to make, someone who was following cues from other artists. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17138-last-words/""><i>Last Words </i>EP</a> from 2012 was catchy but scattered, and last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18670-ryan-hemsworth-guilt-trips/""><i>Guilt Trips</i></a>, as refined as it was, showed a reluctance to commit to any one style. (The exception to these projects was last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18152-ryan-hemsworth-still-awake-ep/""><i>Still Awake </i>EP</a>, the most direct precursor to <i>Alone for the First Time.)</i></p>
<p>Hemsworth was one of the early, post-Girl Talk producers who reveled in the dissolution of genre, and he dabbled in bedroom electronic, candied R&amp;B and Southern hip-hop without pledging allegiance to any of them. It was only when he fully embraced a fourth influence, the 8-bit soundtracks to handheld video games of the '80s and '90s, that he began to focus on refining a specific sound, one that combined his pop instincts with the miniaturized melodies of that format.</p>
<p>He’s been drilling down towards the essence of that sound for more than a year now. And the core he’s reached on the new album reveals a singer-songwriter bedroom pop by way of <i>Final Fantasy</i>. It’s unmistakably a winter album, and would be recognizable as such even were its first single not titled ""Snow in Newark""; the album fairly bleeds nostalgia and comfort—listening to it feels like being swaddled with blankets and pillows. <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">And for the first time, it features Hemsworth working largely with original, lyrical songs</span>, a jarring development for fans who originally came to him for his remixes or production.</p>
<p>Hemsworth has made sport out of feeling vulnerable—his twitter is replete with references to him needing to snuggle—and his lyrics are generally in that mold. When they’re simple, as on ""Walk Me Home"", they can feel tender and lovely. The song’s refrain of ""Leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone, there’s no room for me left in your heart,"" is genuinely heartbreaking, syncing nicely with an upswing of strings and what sounds like a live version of the drum machines he favors. But occasionally, his songs can feel like transmissions of his twitter feed that have been scrubbed of all humor or irony. ""Snow in Newark"" is the best example of this phenomenon: the first verse is one of the album's wordiest, but Hemsworth doesn’t use it to communicate details and the song ends up sounding both vague and precious, reminiscent of a lesser Jack Johnson track.  </p>
<p>Songs like these will garner Hemsworth new fans, but it’s jarring to hear someone with such a refined sense of structure still struggling with songwriting. It can be a relief then to reach a track on which a truly talented vocalist makes up for Hemsworth's lyrical shortcomings. ""Surrounded"", which features the voice of the wonderful Angelino songstress <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/kotomi"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kotomi,</a> is one of the most powerful tracks on the album, and it feels like a natural extension of the R&amp;B remixes that Hemsworth came up on. The singer’s voice breathes life into the lyrics like a good actor into a bad role—the preciousness of the words is swallowed by the power of her emotion and the frantic production that surrounds her voice echoes the track’s message.</p>
<p>Tracks like ""Surrounded"" hint that the problem with Hemsworth’s songs is not necessarily the lyrics but rather his lack of confidence when it comes to doing those simple words justice. But the contrast between the amateurism of his songs is all the more jarring because he’s become such a sure-handed producer. Instrumental tracks like ""Blemish"" and ""Hurt Me"" are quintessential Hemsworth productions, springy, bubbly tracks that sound like they were produced for a <a href=""http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pallet_Town"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pallet Town</a> after party. There’s an undercurrent of melancholy to each that’s balanced nicely by the chirpy synths and springy drums that have long been the producer’s forte.</p>
<p>You have to hand it to Hemsworth for refusing to make the same song over and over again. He’s learning from the artists he’s meeting online, going farther afield than ever before (the album features artists from all over the globe), and growing more comfortable in his role as someone who can create pop, not merely tweak existing songs. <i>Alone for the First Time</i> is the furthest he's pushed himself, and the growing pains on the album can be chalked up to the strain of trying new things, a kind of adolescent awkwardness that shows signs of maturing into something sophisticated and unique.</p></div>"|19952.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19952-ryan-hemsworth-alone-for-the-first-time/|6.0|Jonah Bromwich

While the band’s early peers (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"">the Breeders</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3539-red-house-painters/"">Red House Painters</a>) spent the better part of that decade honing singular aesthetics, His Name Is Alive were intent on doing the opposite. Early albums like <i>Livonia</i> and <i>Stars on E.S.P.</i> flirted with everything from shoegazey ephemera to sun-bleached California dream pop, but never lighted long enough on any one style to truly embody it. Warren Defever—the Michigan-based musician, songwriter, and mercurial heart of the band—embraces a kind of gleeful wanderlust, a predisposition that only intensified after the band parted ways with 4AD in the early 2000s. In the years since, Defever’s output has become even more of a willfully mixed bag, encompassing everything from spooky R&amp;B, blown-out psych rock, meandering instrumental compositions, and—on 2007’s <i>Sweet Earth Flower</i>—an album-length tribute to free jazz saxophonist Marion Brown. Some 20 years deep into their career the only single thread twisting through all of His Name Is Alive’s music has been Defever’s own peculiar force of vision, which makes exploring the band’s now expansive back catalog both a satisfying and weirdly schizophrenic experience.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise, then, that <i>Tecuciztecatl</i>—the band’s 14th full-length—is a thing both wonderful and extraordinarily strange. A concept record that comes with the worrisome descriptor of ""psychedelic rock opera,"" <i>Tecuciztecatl</i> involves a proggy narrative about a young woman who discovers she is pregnant with twins—one good, one evil—and must seek the help of a demon-hunting librarian. Each of the album’s nine tracks is written from the perspective of a different character and the whole melodrama is set to play out like the soundtrack to a gothic psych-rock horror movie that never actually was. (Additionally, every edition of the record—be it on vinyl, CD, or digital download—is unique, each with different mixes and tracklists.) Most records would surely collapse under the weight of this kind of conceptual pretense—the struggle of good versus evil as played out from within the womb! —but <i>Tecuciztecatl</i> succeeds due to the strength of the songs, all of which still operate nicely outside the confines of the album’s bloody narrative.</p>
<p>The album opens with “The Examination”, a 13-minute opus comprised of simmering, Yes-era synthscapes, a chorus of flutes, and—most flamboyantly—an arsenal of fuzzy, overdriven guitar lines twisting around each other. As the song morphs from prog-rock anthem into something resembling a messy garage-funk jam, vocalist Andrea Morici’s plaintive vocals provide a calming counterpoint: ""Look into my eyes/ Look into the light all around you/ Make yourself at home."" As opening salvos go, it’s a doozy…and something the rest of the album never quite lives up to. Still, tracks like ""Reflect Yourself"" and ""See You In a Minute"" play around with classic rock power riffing in ways that are both ridiculous and kind of perfect. Employing harmonious guitar solos that were apparently perfected by practicing along to an edit that Defever created of every <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14178-thin-lizzy/"">Thin Lizzy</a> guitar solo recorded between 1973 and 1983 (It’s a real thing. You can check it out on YouTube), much of <i>Tecuciztecatl</i> plays like a celebration of the kind of bombastic, gatefold double-album sonic excess that marked '70s bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2297-king-crimson/"">King Crimson</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7953-emerson-lake-and-palmer/"">Emerson Lake and Palmer</a>.</p>
<p>It would be easy for these sorts of rock opera theatrics to come across as jokey or ironically reverential, but Defever's earnest commitment never wavers. Psych-rock noodlings aside, it’s the more subdued tracks—the splish-splashy ""African Violet Casts a Spell"" and the pastoral vibes of album closer ""The Cup""—that not only sound the most like classic His Name Is Alive, but also save the record from simply being a conceptual goof. Divorced from the album’s bizarro storyline, ""I Believe Your Heart Is No Longer Inside This Room"" would still rank as one of His Name Is Alive’s most inspired tracks—a song that manages to simultaneously address birth and death while also incorporating an orchestral snippet of ""Joy to the World"" in a way that somehow makes total sense. No small feat.</p>
<p>In the end <i>Tecuciztecatl</i> is an unusual treat because it manages to have it both ways. As an aspiring rock opera, the album is sufficiently bombastic, but it’s also surprisingly emotional. That the record can be both is a testament to Warren Defever’s kooky dexterity and his continued willingness to take big, weird conceptual risks—something that gets celebrated less and less within the increasingly homogenous landscape of what has come to be known as indie rock. <i>Tecuciztecatl</i> will certainly not be everybody’s cup of demon twin tea—and as albums go it is the very definition of a ""grower""—but those willing to spend time with it will are to be rewarded with what is a sometimes challenging but ultimately strangely beautiful listen.</p></div>"|19965.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19965-his-name-is-alive-tecuciztecatl/|7.6|T.

Since then, the Japanese instrumental outfit has incrementally raised the presence of chamber sounds on their records, to the point where their last two full-lengths—the 2010 live album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14272-holy-ground-nyc-live-with-the-wordless-music-orchestra/""><i>Holy Ground</i></a> and the 2012 studio album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16985-for-my-parents/""><i>For My Parents</i></a>—were swamped with symphonic fluff. It’s pretty enough, but it also undercut one of the band’s initial strengths: tension. Crescendos and cannonades became as quaint as clockwork, and the band’s magnificence was made mundane. The best that could be said of Mono is that they were impeccable self-editors.</p>
<p>That hasn’t changed on <i>The Last Dawn</i> and <i>Rays of Darkness</i>, two new studio albums being released concurrently. Spread between two discs, the 10 songs feel more like an average Mono double-LP split in half and given two names. But there’s something at least nominally interesting about the way they’re divided: <i>The Last Dawn</i> continues along the orchestral arc that <i>For My Parents</i> followed, while <i>Rays of Darkness </i>strips things down to the rock-quartet bone—and adds a couple of tiny surprises that don’t make up for an overall lack of spark.</p>
<p><i>The Last Dawn </i>is a dreary exercise in being as obvious as possible. With violin and cello as its crutches, “The Land Between Tides/Glory” squanders a fantastic intro—Zeppelin-esque in tone, shoegazing in execution—with percussive clichés and a corny piano coda. The candlelit keys on “Kanata” are even worse; there are 70s soap-opera theme songs with more emotive potency. Mono’s debt to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"">Mogwai</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"">Sigur Rós</a> has never been hidden, but the waltzing schmaltz of “Cyclone” could be the product of any Explosions in the Sky knockoff of the past 10 years. Make no mistake, <i>The Last Dawn </i>is both sweeping and elegant, full of grand melodic gestures and updrafts of euphoric distortion. You can hear the big punches coming from a light year away, and that’s part of their power: They tug at the nervous system like circadian rhythms. But when the title track sleepwalks out of the orchestra pit and into the realm of noise-pop lullaby, it might as well be the scratch of a pencil on a checklist.</p>
<p>And, <i>Rays of Darkness</i> is just inexplicably dull. On it, Mono pulls off an impressive feat: smashing gargantuan swells of drama and volume into two-dimensional smudges, as if they were bugs to be afraid of. The removal of a string section might seem like a brave move on their part, especially after relying on its ostensible grandeur for so long—but they don’t substitute anything in its place except a higher setting on the fuzz pedal. “Recoil, Ignite” isn’t bad by any means, although its whale-song-through-a-Marshall-stack sound just sits in the midrange, inert and suspenseless. Making background music this loud is an accomplishment itself, even though “The Last Rays” confuses beige static with edgy experimentalism.</p>
<p>A couple of guest artists help liven up two of the album’s four tracks: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/650-calexico/"">Calexico</a>’s Jacob Valenzuela lends his trumpet to “Surrender,” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4953-envy/"">Envy</a>’s Tetsu Fukagawa sings on “The Hand That Holds the Truth”. The former track is another case of missed opportunities; Valenzuela’s tone is dusty and ghostlike, but all he does is follow the guitar for a few bars. Nothing will make you wish harder for Rob Mazurek’s punchy, twisty trumpet on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJdv2DGu-qc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“TNT”</a>. Fukagawa’s vocals on “The Hand That Holds the Truth” are far more successful. True to form, he howls a hole through the flimsy, post-rock-patterned tissue of the song. If only the song pushed back—against him or anything.</p>
<p>Post-rock works best when it embraces, or at least acknowledges, the subatomic friction within the conventional rock lineup. The same goes for cinematic music, another genre that Mono <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mitsuyo/where-we-begin-narrative-dance-film-needs-your-sup"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">have a leg in</a>; without counterpoint and textural contrast, it can slump into a pretty blob. These two new releases may be at attempt to point out some diametric dialogue at play within Mono’s music, but the range is so constricted it doesn’t allow for much beyond meek agreement. There’s a lack of texture and energy to these two albums, and also a lack of ideas; almost every song feels like a practice-space warm-up jammed and discarded by a far better band. At times in the past, Mono have been that band, and echoes of that exquisite urgency still surface here and there. It’s not enough.

The Newcastle singer-songwriter’s breakthrough album, 2011’s <i>The Magic Bridge</i>, features songs like ""Grandad’s Deathbed Hallucinations"" and ""Man Has Been Struck Down by Hands Unseen"", as well as a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIXk7PQGg_I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Black dog in the sky/ Who pisses and slobbers all over the world.""</a> When looking for inspiration for his follow-up (2013’s concept piece <i>The Glass Trunk</i>) Dawson began with a database search for ""death"" at his hometown museum. The album’s a capella ballads, inspired by centuries-old news clippings, tell tales of mutilated horses, murder, and the moors. His latest LP, <i>Nothing Important</i>, is no less morbid in its talking points, but the tragedies described are less outlandish. The subject matter feels personal, often uncomfortably so, and Dawson always falls far from sentimentalizing or softening it.</p>
<p>The primary sonic forces on the album are Dawson’s brittle, crudely amplified nylon-string acoustic guitar—which recalls the timbre of UK free-improv giant Derek Bailey’s playing—and his fitfully expressive tenor voice, which, when not incited to the point of howling self-evisceration, evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4629-robert-wyatt/"">Robert Wyatt</a>’s. On other albums Dawson has explored his disparate musical tendencies separately from one another: Experimental drones, folk sketches, imitation field cries, and free jazz diversions were relegated to separate tracks and even different releases. <i>Nothing Important</i> fulfills and extends the promise of this earlier work; incongruous stylistic elements are overlaid upon one another, and packed into unwieldy but tightly-wrapped packages (particularly, two dense, 16-minute long compositions).</p>
<p>The album’s lyrics begin with a birth, but the time stamp suggests that it is not Dawson’s: ""I am born by Caesarean section at 9:30 AM/ In Princess Mary’s Maternity Hospital on the 24th May/ Sixty years ago today."" In a handful of lengthy verses—often fit to iambic rhythms and lilting melodies reminiscent of 16th-century madrigals—Dawson sketches painful but faint memories, including the death of a baby and an uncle who reappears as a ghost. The choruses are explosive, and derail easily (""I am nothing/ You are nothing/ Nothing important""). Running through a laundry list of mundane, still-life images maddens the title track’s narrator to the point of surrendering: ""Why do they remain so clear while the faces of my loved ones disappear?"" Eventually Dawson’s voice trails off, and the instrumental themes which hold the piece together reappear briefly—fatigued and sluggish—and fade. Full of unlikely musical juxtapositions and bizarre imagery (dark omens like ""a barracuda chewing on a chrysanthemum"" or ""a forking hairline seam of superglue through the Black Gate"") ""Nothing Important"" is perhaps Dawson’s most ambitious and affecting composition to date.</p>
<p>""The Vile Stuff"" is less nuanced: a slow-burning dirge based around a snippet of a sinister, raga-like melody. Dawson’s lyrics center on a group of classmates (""year 7’s"") who suffer dire consequences after sharing a Coke-bottled slurry of mixed liquors on a fieldtrip. The humor here is pitch black, similar to that of <a href=""http://dpworks.net/smilga/gashlycrumb-tinies.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an Edward Gorey picture book</a>: Dawson’s narrator and his fellow transgressors suffer fractured skulls and cheekbones, stab screwdrivers through their hands, and hop into bed with their teachers. The song culminates in a blistering cacophony of bowed harp drones (courtesy of Dawson’s frequent collaborator Rhodri Davies), funereal percussion and feedback—the sound is only as discordant and unpleasant as adolescence.</p>
<p><i>Nothing Important</i> is driven by an ongoing conflict between entropic impulsiveness and an almost classical sense of beauty and order. The music is frequently caught in a tug of war between melody and harmony. In the guitar instrumentals that bookend the album, for instance, Dawson always runs the risk of letting a particularly effusive riff overwhelm the chords and rhythms, and topple the whole musical edifice into a series of fragmented stabs and melodic shards. The lyrics, meanwhile, alternate visions of despair, pain, and anger with moments of reconciliation and acceptance. The ritual drama of falling and picking one’s self back up again (taking ""responsibility,"" as Dawson prefers in interviews) plays out in every element of this music, and is key to its elusive power.</p></div>"|19904.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19904-richard-dawson-nothing-important/|7.8|Winston Cook-Wilson

Since turning 68 last November, Young has become <a href=""https://ponomusic.force.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a tech startup figurehead</a>, <a href=""http://neilyounglies.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an enemy of Canadian conservatives and oil companies</a>, a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Special-Deluxe-Memoir-Life-Cars/dp/0399172084"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">second-time author</a>, and a <a href=""http://www.robertbermangallery.com/exhibitions/neil-young-special-deluxe"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">watercolor artist</a>. He’s done a European tour with a modified Crazy Horse, U.S. shows all by his lonesome, and recorded a no-fi covers collection with Jack White. And perhaps most notably, he’s divorcing his wife of 36 years, and has been spotted <a href=""http://www.relix.com/news/detail/neil_young_goes_public_with_daryl_hannah_pegi_young_bows_out_of_farm_aid"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">canoodling with a notable ex-mermaid</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Amid that manic activity, the high concept of <i>Storytone</i> barely raises an eyebrow. Ten tracks recorded live in front of a 92-piece orchestra and choir or a jazz big band, the project doesn’t fit neatly within either the acoustic or electric categories that have been the magnetic poles of Young’s career. But it also calls back to some odd moments from his discography: the orchestrated excesses of ""A Man Needs a Maid"" and ""There’s a World"" from <i>Harvest</i>, with a dash of 1988’s largely forgettable <i>This Note’s for You</i>. Once again, he’s fallen in love with the actress, and only a symphonic scale will do.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Unlike the Voice-o-Graph pops and crackles of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19295-neil-young-a-letter-home/"" target=""_blank""><i>A Letter Home</i></a>, which seemed like a classic Neil joke on the heels of his fidelity-obsessed Pono pitch, <i>Storytone</i> spares no sonic expense, with the arrangements set to maximum lush. So maybe call it A Little Touch of Schmeil in the Night, even if the songs only sound like standards and Young is far from your typical crooner. A set of 10 songs predominantly concerned with the withering of old love and the promise of new—and, as such, haunted by his recent romantic tabloid escapades—<i>Storytone</i> is unabashedly melodramatic and earnest, occasionally sounding more like the passions of a 17-year-old instead of someone on the brink of their seventies.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Unfortunately, aside from placing that unorthodox warble against a velvety backdrop, <i>Storytone</i> plays it straight, often veering into the deep schmaltz of a Vegas revue. The arrangements, by Michael Bearden (who has worked with Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga) and Chris Walden (an arranger for Michael Bublé and ""American Idol""), are exquisitely produced but hollow, gilding the songs without adding any thoughtful counterpoint. ""Who’s Gonna Stand Up?"", Neil’s latest eco-anthem, is given a dark, cinematic urgency, and the light countrypolitan stomp of ""When I Watch You Sleeping"" recalls the rustic sweep of 2005’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8855-prairie-wind/"" target=""_blank""><i>Prairie Wind</i></a>, but more typical are the harp and chime twinkles applied without subtlety to ""Tumbleweed"" or the Navy Pier blooze of ""Say Hello to Chicago"".</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Helpfully, you can assess these additions thanks to Young providing solo versions of each track on the album’s deluxe edition—sparse near-demos on guitar, piano, and ukulele that come closer to the intimate sound of his recent, rambling theatre sets. Stripped down, the dark, doubtful elements of ""Plastic Flowers"" or ""Say Hello to Chicago"" come to the fore, Young’s tenor sounding vulnerable instead of overmatched. Here, the contradiction of putting a protest song against fracking and fossil fuels right next to a song called ""I Want to Drive My Car"" is somewhat resolved, as the latter gets a hushed version that makes Young’s autophilia sound more like an embarrassing addiction than a passion. But the solo versions of the more PDA material in the album’s back half make something of a case for their fancier counterparts, leaving nothing to hide valentine lyrics unavoidably about Daryl Hannah (the “A Man Needs a Mermaid” joke writes itself).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Despite the dual versions, <i>Storytone</i> never finds a comfortable middle ground: the orchestral versions too maudlin, the solo versions over-sharing. More so than the goofily overwrought <i>Harvest</i> tracks with the London Symphony Orchestra, the flaws of <i>Storytone</i> throw back to Young’s restless '80s (or 2002’s <i>Are You Passionate?</i>), where genres were meticulously recreated but often a poor fit for his songwriting and performing strengths. For an artist who can make an orchestral roar with Old Black or twist an emotional knife on a pump organ, the extra gloss is subtraction by addition.</p></div>"|19969.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19969-neil-young-storytone/|4.8|Rob Mitchum

Koze doesn’t just move around what’s already there, but takes some small portion or impulse within a song and creates an entirely new context for it. Usually, the new context brings out a quality or shade in the music only hinted at by the original, hence the word ""reincarnation"": The body is new but the soul is still the same. A Koze remix of a meatball might be a hamburger; his remix of a horse might be a car.</p>
<p>Koze is playful, which is nice because most of the artists he works with are not. Witness Ada’s ""Faith"", a modest ballad sung by a choir of androids too tired to care anymore. In Koze’s hands, it becomes a starlit torch song in some Palm Springs lounge; the androids still melancholy but now played for their sex appeal, too. Or Herbert’s ""You Saw It All"", which appears here as a Motown-style love letter that breaks into a clarinet solo played by someone who may not have ever played a clarinet before. (My favorite Koze remix is still of Matthew Dear’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YssOtPsVpHM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Elementary Lover""</a>, which places a stern Germanic orator in the middle of what sounds like Club Med.)</p>
<p>These are gestures that understand and dignify the source material but don’t let it restrict them. Often, Koze seems like a boy pirouetting through the museum, ornamenting treasures of antiquity with handlebar mustaches and tiny yellow birds. Even when his music isn’t outright funny, there is something about it that feels casual and loose, allowing stray beauty at the margins of the track—a breath, a syllable—to blossom into a central hook. I still don’t know whether to pronounce his name DJ <i>Cot-zuh</i> or DJ <i>Cozy</i>, and my guess is that the ambiguity is intentional.</p>
<p><i>Reincarnations Pt. 2</i> collects his last six years; the first volume collected 2001–2009. Both are strong, though the highlights on the first edition—""Elementary Lover"" or Battles’ ""Atlas""—are a little brighter. Like Todd Terje, Koze is a Northern European prankster who built his reputation on remixes but whose own music gets better every time he decides to make it. Last year, he put out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17793-dj-koze-amygdala/""><i>Amygdala</i></a>, an album that had more to do with the history of psychedelic pop than with techno in the same way Terje’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19148-todd-terje-its-album-time/""><i>It’s Album Time</i></a> had more to do with film music and exotica than disco. If you have never heard Koze, start there. His is a low-key beautiful world, governed by bright colors, round shapes, and a gentleness that can seem meek but more often just seems like the byproduct of wonder. ""It is fairly easy to rock the house,"" he told an interviewer in 2008, ""but so hard to look out of the window.""</p></div>"|19962.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19962-dj-koze-reincarnations-pt-2/|7.3|Mike Powell

Smith is his fondness for the live album. Wikipedia counts <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_discography#Live_albums"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">31 live records</a> by the band, and that’s not including the handful of part-live/part-studio efforts that have appeared over the years. This album appears to fall into the latter category, although details are scant. There are few clues as to what was recorded when. A couple of its tracks sound like studio creations—a thought confirmed by a number of posts on a Fall <a href=""http://z1.invisionfree.com/thefall/index.php?showtopic=38192&amp;st=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">discussion board</a>—while the live material is taken from a series of shows spanning 2008–2012. Even the release of it has been unusual, with the album originally set to come out last year bearing a different title and track listing. Longstanding Fall fans will be used to such about-turns in approach, such as the subtly different versions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2975-the-real-new-fall-lp-formerly-country-on-the-click/""><i>The Real New Fall LP (Formerly Country on the Click)</i> </a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2980-fall-heads-roll/""><i>Fall Heads Roll</i></a> that surfaced when those albums were originally issued.</p>
<p>The build-up to the release of <i>Uurop VIII-XII Places in Sun &amp; Winter, Son</i> barely befits such a low stakes addition to the Fall’s canon. It’s got the feel of a bootleg—the recording is at times horribly thin, and the occasional snatches of audience chatter make it sound like the work of someone staggering drunkenly through the crowd with a barely concealed mic. Word has been good about the Fall’s live shows in the past few years, especially when they returned to a double-drummer format. It’s typically contrary of Smith to document them like this, with a song like ""Jetplane"", the standout from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18044-the-fall-re-mit/""><i>Re-Mit</i></a>, sounding like it was recorded through a thick woolen blanket. It wouldn’t surprise anyone if Smith claimed to prefer it that way. The opening ""Wings (with Bells)"" and the later ""Reformation - Utrecht"" don’t fare much better in the audio stakes, although the latter is at least an intense performance, albeit one that sounds like it was recorded from a bathroom cubicle in the bowels of the venue.</p>
<p>The two alleged studio recordings, ""Auto 2014 Chip Replace"" and ""Amorator"", are the worthiest additions to <i>Uurop</i>, although both are little more than curios. Smith is in wonderfully hoarse form on the former, where the drums stick to a neat Klaus Dinger clip, Elena Poulou’s keyboards fizz in all the right places, and an unexpected (if slightly ill-thought out) about-turn closes down the track. Neither of the songs make much sense here, although this is an enterprise that doesn’t deal in logic, especially as the commercial demand for poorly recorded live tracks is surely at an all-time low. Sometimes the grain of the recordings adds something; the leaden throb of David Spurr’s bass on “Irish” resembles someone shoveling through heavy mud, while Smith’s over-loud and distorted vocal on the same track is suitably terrifying when it first lands. A typically acerbic ""Fifty Year Old Man"" and the following ""Wolf Kidult Man"" are highlights, with both gaining a welcome layer of malice from being so grating in texture.</p>
<p>In 2004, the Fall released another part live/part studio album titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2977-interim/""><i>Interim</i></a>, the title of which made it feel like a stopgap. <i>Uurop</i> falls along similar same lines—unless there’s a surprise in store, there will have been no new studio album from the band in 2014, so this plugs a hole that didn’t really need filling in the first place. It’s a record that will most likely be listened to a few times by devotees then filed on a shelf or in a digital archive, regularly getting thumbed past on the way to better material. Even people who were at these shows may have found their way to recordings of these moments already, or would rather not remember them this way.</p></div>"|19899.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19899-the-fall-live-uurop-viii-xii-places-in-sun-winter-son/|4.6|Nick Neyland

The circumstances are different, but the conundrum is always the same: How do you translate the most intimate, infinity-grappling ponderings into songs that convey the micro and the macro of the matter, answers to questions that have eluded the wise, and enabled the ignorant, for millennia? On </span><i>Believer</i><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">, the debut full-length by Megafortress, sole member Bill Gillim successfully charts a different course. He foregoes conclusions altogether and reframes the big questions as abstract, almost mathematical contrivances. Then he threads his voice through them like a thief trying to pick a lock.</span></p>
<p>For all the album’s well chilled minimalism, Gillim’s voice is the most immediately striking thing about <i>Believer</i>. It’s virtuosic, in its own way; his lyrics are delivered in neat, easily graspable phrases and with piercing plainness, but the notes are pure. He’s not trying to confound or mystify, even though his range can plunge from heavenly falsetto to tormented moan. It doesn’t hurt that he gives his voice so much space. “Fear” is not only one of <i>Believer</i>’s most riveting songs, it’s the album’s fullest exploration of Gillim’s scope. Round, pulsing notes are coaxed from an upright bass while samples of saxophones split and reassemble around it. A piano skitters here; empty space yawns there. There’s a biomorphic falseness to the arrangement’s smooth, curved surfaces, but Gillim’s vocals breathe life into them. His lines are slow, drawn out, burdened with psychic weight. When he sings the word “fear” in an operatic register that would make <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4672-craig-wedren/"">Craig Wedren</a> proud, it’s one of the most arresting single syllables anyone’s committed to record all year. “Fear has come undone,” he intones narcotically, and the absence of anything to replace it is just as terrifying.<b> </b></p>
<p>Besides his voice, piano seems to be Gillim’s primary instrument. But where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19798-perfume-genius-too-bright/"">Perfume Genius</a>’s Mike Hadreas and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19820-grouper-ruins/"">Grouper</a>’s Liz Harris have made unique, majestic use of the keys-plus-voice equation this year, Gillim pulls back. He opts for tender clusters of chords, allowing his songs to be driven more by synth hums and hovering blocks of nothing. “Pilot” works field-recorded loops of seagulls into its gaping, throbbing, extended metaphor for angels; eventually they’re indistinguishable from helicopter blades. The instrumentals “Beginning” and “Bogota” feel incidental, treading the line between ambient and disposable. Mostly that’s because so many tracks on <i>Believer</i> seem as though they may be instrumental, up until Gillim’s celestial voice wanders in; if he’s trying to toy with expectations, it works at cross purposes to the record’s overall leap-of-faith prerequisite.</p>
<p>The songs ""Never Becomer"", ""Believer"", and ""Murderer"" appear back to back on the album, and those accusatory titles form a triptych. From agnostic to follower to apostate: Gillim presents portraits of discreet devotional forms, then sets them up as a surrogate for a more sacred trinity. Accordingly, they’re wildly incongruous pieces of a puzzle: ""Never Becomer"" is a voiceless meditation that spins around a shimmering synth arpeggio, while ""Believer"" adds more sampled birdsong—along with bucolic splashes of water—to the album, that is until it succumbs to a disjointed, almost industrial creep. ""One hand for the Devil/ Same hand for the Lord,"" Gillim sings, and he comes within an inch of being too obvious. But he backs off on “Murderer"". Not only is it the most pop-forward track on <i>Believer</i>, it lets its massive bass-snare beat etch out a vast territory of loneliness and unknowing that Gillim pegs as the heart of his spiritual confusion: ""No one to stand by my side/ No one to wait for me,"" he pleads, then he adds slyly, ""I cannot make out your intentions/ But I know mine."" By that point, the beat has ground to a halt and the synth hook has collapsed into an asthmatic drone.</p>
<p>Dissonance and self-deconstruction dance at the edges of <i>Believer</i>, although Gillim manicures that unease most gorgeously on ""Live in Grace"". It begins with him singing, unaccompanied, ""I can never recall your face/ But I know the sound of your voice/ Telling me to live in grace."" Keyboards seep in like shadows, then ring like bells. The tension he creates is delicious, a stasis between sinister and ecstatic, and that’s only heightened when he sings ""Man with a thousand names/ But never just one to call when all alone""—especially seeing as how ""man with a thousand names"" could just as easily apply to God as to Satan. ""Climb if you wanna, baby/ It’s the same as falling down,"" he adds by way of summary. As beautifully simple as that sentiment is, he puts a little twist in it on the way out, and the bass line stumbles as it descends. Grace, he seems to be hinting, is not a state of being, becoming, or believing, but some quantum cloud of all three. With <i>Believer</i>, Gillim is neither finding nor losing his religion. He’s groping in the heart-stopping hope of simply feeling the shape of it.</p></div>"|19802.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19802-megafortress-believer/|7.7|Jason Heller

The Southern California quartet have made an explosive hardcore-meets-'70s-swagger joint with <i>Poison Everything</i>, their debut full-length for <a href=""https://www.southernlord.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Southern Lord</a>, but the album comes at a time when rock music—guitar music, even—is losing its cultural capital. Even if it inspires a few cheap ""rock is dead"" articles, that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as rock and metal’s conservative wing has grown tiresome and irrelevant—see former W.A.S.P. guitarist Chris Holmes’ <a href=""http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/former-w-a-s-p-guitarist-chris-holmes-relocates-to-france-i-aint-going-back-to-america/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>interview at this year’s Hellfest</span></a>, where he displays his bitterness about hip-hop replacing metal as the rebellious music of choice, thus, reducing his chances to ""make it"" in the States. Obliterations charge on anyway, and <i>Poison</i>'s energy makes it a vital record, even if it’s somewhat out of step. </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Most of <i>Poison</i> is rock'n'roll as it should be—fuckin’ fast, fuckin’ loud, and ready with a joint and a case of whatever economy lager most litters your local punk house or DIY space (bringing Sierra Nevada to a house show? Get the fuck outta here!). Most songs are 2 minutes or shorter, and they barely stop to mull over the damage they’ve inflicted. This isn’t pure nihilism, however, as there’s also an influence from political punk and grindcore bands like Discharge and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5443-napalm-death/"">Napalm Death</a> at hand here. The cover art, with its not-so-subtle references to Apple and Chase in Xerox black and white, is the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10633-scum-20th-anniversary-edition/""><i>Scum</i></a> of 2014. (That eye on the top right corner bears quite a similarity to the eye on Discharge’s <i>Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing</i>, too.) The lyrics deal with frustration from complacency, depression, and our decline into the apocalypse, all of which could have appeared on a crust album from the '80s.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When Obliterations set aside the blinding frenzy <i>Poison</i> blossoms like a carrion flower. ""Shame"" is the album’s slowest song, but also one of the album’s best, a Motor City banger in the tradition of Rob Asheton and Fred Smith. Opening with a brief wave of feedback before going into a groovy riff that carries a tough haziness, ""Shame"" best combines the group’s voracious punkiness and feel for hooks. ""Open Casket"" also takes on a doomier approach, though it’s closer to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/"">the Melvins</a> than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"">Sabbath</a>. ""The Middle of the End"" shows a slightly different side of Obliterations’ Detroit obsession, moving like Motown on nasty speed. <i>Poison</i> will not, no matter what teary-eyed rock Jimmy Swaggerts would hope, convince kids to burn their MacBooks and pick up Gibsons. It does, however, put forth scorched-earth attitude that is a common thread amongst the anger of youth, disaffected or privileged or otherwise. That attitude should never diminish, even if the its voice changes.</p></div>"|19928.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19928-obliterations-poison-everything/|7.5|Andy O'Connor

Beyond that, though, Arca is best known as a next-generation super-producer, or a potential one, anyway. He's already produced some of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30936-twigs/"">FKA twigs</a>' best work, he's co-producing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a>'s next album, and he had a hand in four songs on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/""><i>Yeezus</i></a>.</p>
<p>Ghersi's proper debut album, <i>Xen</i>, named for his ambiguously gendered alter ego, shows that his brush with the big time has not softened him. Kick drums stutter and stumble; rhythmic patterns fall apart in mid-song. A few of the beat-oriented tracks, like ""Fish"", have come completely untethered from the rigid grid that usually governs electronic music's timekeeping. Sounding like a hardstyle rework of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/"">Laurie Anderson</a>'s ""O Superman"" made with a broken MIDI clock, it flaps at the edges like a tarp with a busted tent pole. Aside from a few relatively placid sketches recalling Harold Budd or Vangelis' <i>Blade Runner</i> soundtrack, the palette tends to emphasize hammered metal, broken glass, and melted plastic; plucked tones and bent notes and nails-on-a-chalkboard sheets of dissonance. (The strident synths of ""Tongue"" sound like they've been inspired by the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VP5jEAP3K4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shower scene</a> in <i>Psycho</i>.) Taken as a whole, it is an album about unstable unities, things that cannot easily hold together, wholes breaking to pieces and being put back together again in new and unfamiliar shapes.</p>
<p>Even the pacing of the album seems to move in fits and starts. From the dramatic opener, ""Now You Know"", all elastic arpeggios and rocket-launch glissandi, he feints left into the Harold Budd homage ""Held Apart"", and from there it's on to the schizophrenic ""Xen"", a song divided between metallic locust-swarm passages and Fairlight fantasias flecked with synthetic birdsong. ""Slit Thru"", a downcast Dem Bow number, gives way to the languorous and atmospheric ""Failed"", a meandering synthesizer jam that wouldn't sound out of place on <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/visiblecloaks/fairlights-mallets-and-bamboo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Fairlights, Mallets and Bamboo</i></a>, a mixtape of Japanese ambient pop from the 1980s. From there, the pizzicato string synths of ""Family Violence"" lead into the reggaeton-leaning ""Thievery"", the closest thing to a single on the album. And so on, all the way through the anticlimactic (but still exhilarating!) closer, ""Promise"", with its aimless string plucks and blast-furnace rumble. <i>Xen </i>feels less like a narrative arc than an amalgam of two- and three-minute chunks that might work just as well on shuffle. That's not a criticism. To the contrary: the album's mazelike shape is an indicator of how much lies beneath the surface. You really could get lost in this thing.</p>
<p>It's been a while since it felt like there was anything really, categorically <i>new </i>in popular music, or even semi-popular music. As Simon Reynolds' <i>Retromania</i> argued, the story of the century so far has mostly been one of collaging together the bits and pieces of earlier decades. Gradually, however, it is becoming clear that something is cresting the horizon, and while it's too early to make out the particulars of its shape—this lumbering behemoth with the Teflon gleam and Transformer joints and image-mapping skin—it is getting closer.</p>
<p>This new thing is not a genre, exactly; call it a style, a sensibility, a veneer. It has to do with computers and digital sound and digital imagery. It has to do with representation and malleability, the idea that sound and image can be stretched and twisted and copied ad nauseam. It revels in digital gloss and grit, in bent tones, in smeared and frozen reverb tails. Extreme compression, schizoid pith: rap vocals broken down to monosyllables, a single ""Huh"" as metonym for everything that's happened between the Sugarhill Gang and now. History reduced to a USB stick.</p>
<p>It's not necessarily sci-fi in its themes—not, say, in the way that Detroit techno celebrated cybernetics and space travel—but there's still something inherently futuristic about its portrayal of technology as something tangible and even sensual, its suggestion that data has texture and heft. It spins code into a second skin. (I realize that that description doesn't sound that far off from <i>The Matrix</i>—a 1999 film that, these days, we're likelier to read as kitsch than as prophecy—but this stuff is different; it's less Keanu than Cronenberg.) You can make out its traces in the work of people like Actress, Oneohtrix Point Never, Evian Christ, FKA twigs, Berlin's Janus crew, and even PC Music, and it feels like it's coming to a head on Arca's <i>Xen</i>. The next few years—<i>his</i> next few years—are going to be interesting. </p></div>"|19836.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19836-arca-xen/|8.4|Philip Sherburne

The stability of long-term companionship, steady employment, and home ownership comes at the expense of spontaneity, adventure, and wanderlust—and vice versa. Inevitably, those residing on opposite ends of the spectrum start to long for what the other has. For the working musician—whose very livelihood is a function of perpetual financial risk and chronic displacement—those poles shift further apart with each passing year, thus amplifying the cruel irony of trying to make a living so, that one day, they can enjoy a life that’s ultimately creeping further out of reach.</p>
<p>While the old adage says ""there’s no place like home,"" for Alex Zhang Hungtai home is no place. The music he’s produced as Dirty Beaches has amounted to an extended examination of the vagabond life, one that he comes by honestly. (Well before he became a touring performer, he had spent his formative years shuttling between Taipei, Hawaii, Montreal, and all points in between.) While his 2011 breakthrough, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15281-badlands/""><i>Badlands</i></a>, romanticized the lone-wolf lifestyle with its impeccably pompadoured inhabitations of early-Elvis and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"">Suicide</a>-schooled bad-boy archetypes, the music he’s released since has focused on the flipside of that outlaw ideal: the constant sense of dislocation and isolation.</p>
<p>His electro-shocked 2013 album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18076-dirty-beaches-drifters-love-is-the-devil/""><i>Drifters</i> and its soundscaped counterpart <i>Love Is the Devil</i></a> respectively captured both the hedonistic allure and homesick ennui of globe-trotting travel. But on Dirty Beaches’ latest release, that feeling of disorientation and disconnection becomes all-consuming—to the point of obliterating his Dirty Beaches identity altogether. If <i>Love Is the Devil</i> was a series of impressionistic snapshots cataloguing the many far-flung locales stamped on Zhang's ever-crowded passport, the all-instrumental <i>Stateless</i> captures the eerie sensation of waking up and not knowing where—or who—you are. After hearing this album, you'll understand why Zhang recently announced he's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/57227-dirty-beaches-calls-it-quits/"" target=""_blank"">retiring the Dirty Beaches concept</a>: this is the sound of an artist who, after years of nomadic musical exploration, has reached the end of the road, with nothing but open water before him and a desire to submerge himself completely. </p>
<p>The pensive instrumentals on <i>Love Is the Devil</i> revealed Zhang's mounting interest in less theatrical, more introspective modes of expression. With <i>Stateless</i>, he finally achieves the state of pure anonymity that his work has been inching toward, fashioning four extended pieces that do away not just with vocals and rhythm, but identifiable melodic motifs altogether. As was the case with <i>Love Is the Devil</i>, the song titles serve as highly evocative headers to blank diary entries—but where its predecessor offered some geographic cues to help frame Zhang’s free-form excursions (""Berlin"", ""Alone at the Danube River""), <i>Stateless</i> deals in intangible, existential messaging: ""Displaced"", ""Time Washes Away Everything"", and so forth. Even the one recognizable locale—""Pacific Ocean""—is defined by its imposing vastness.</p>
<p>For all its seeming aesthetic and thematic open-endedness, however, <i>Stateless</i> proves to be the most focussed, tightly orchestrated release in the Dirty Beaches canon. For one, its two album sides share a similar arc, opening with a relatively shorter piece—both of which clock in at exactly 7:27—that set up longer works surpassing the double-digits mark. And where the instrumentals on <i>Love Is the Devil </i>had a more roaming quality—with Zhang laying down wandering piano lines and serrated guitar shards as a gateway into his subconscious—<i>Stateless</i> is a work of deceptively serene, slow-roiling tension, liberated from traditional song structure yet claustrophobically contained at the same time.</p>
<p>Recorded in his current homebase of Lisbon, the album primarily features Zhang on synths and saxophone, but, in stark contrast to that combo’s new-agey connotations, the tracks here are corroded in grainy, greyscale textures. With Zhang’s staccato sax squawks woven into Colin Stetson-like oscillations alongside guest Vittorio Demarin’s trembling viola, the opening ""Displaced"" resembles the foreboding intro to a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1742-godspeed-you-black-emperor/"">Godspeed You! Black Emperor</a> epic (shut your eyes and you can practically picture <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBk9tTkNMB4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the accompanying Karl Lemieux projections</a>), but lingers on the sense of encroaching dread rather than deliver the crescendo rock-out. On the title track, layered synth drones form an oppressively thick mist under which Zhang’s saxophone murmurs are barely audible, like foghorns emanating from some indeterminate location far off in the distance. For Zhang, the ship is always arriving, but never settling.</p>
<p><i>Stateless</i>’ second act eases up on the tension, and in its place, reveal subtle but forceful moments of emotional release: ""Pacific Ocean"" begins as a synth hum that’s as monochromatic and all-enveloping as the namesake body of water, but Zhang gradually introduces affective chord changes that hint at all the wondrous subaquatic life that exists beneath the surface. And the immense 14-minute closer ""Time Washes Away Everything"" brings Demarin back for an exquisitely melancholic meditation whose intertwined, synth-swaddled viola and sax sweeps constantly seem to be on the verge of flickering out, before the embers come alight more brightly than before.</p>
<p>If <i>Love Is the Devil</i> was intended to challenge the expectations of fans initially drawn to Zhang for the greaser persona and wild-child shrieks, then <i>Stateless—</i>fitting for a finale—proves to be the ultimate test of their commitment. The album’s stationary sound and glacial pace, ironically, make it a more demanding listen than Dirty Beaches’ more outwardly confrontational, punk-inspired previous releases. But coming from a musician who, not too long ago, could be easily slotted alongside other retro-fetishist garage-rockers, <i>Stateless</i> feels less like a sad, unceremonious farewell than the quietly triumphant completion of a mission, the final step in an ongoing process of deconstructing Zhang's prefab persona into something pure and personal. Before the news broke of Dirty Beaches' demise, <i>Stateless</i> sounded like an audio analogue to Zhang’s eternally unmoored existence. But now, it feels like the natural end point of Dirty Beaches' unpredictable aesthetic evolution. In other words, it feels like home. </p></div>"|19863.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19863-dirty-beaches-stateless/|7.6|Stuart Berman

As well they should. For the better part of a decade, they’ve created music of extreme emotional and physical engagement, music tagged as “post-hardcore” because of the reverberating guitars and five-minute song lengths or “screamo” by the less self-conscious. Their 2009 debut <i>Old Pride</i> had a recording of Kyle Durfey’s mother describing the debilitating effects of multiple sclerosis on her husband, a perversely calm moment because words were being spoken instead of yelled. Longevity isn’t expected out of the bands or the people in it, and there are an equal number of former and current members of Pianos Become the Teeth. Several moonlight with Geoff Rickly’s hyperbolic, great punk rock and roll swindle <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32333-united-nations"">United Nations</a>; by comparison, that’s a fun band. And now here’s <i>Keep You</i>, the result of Pianos Become the Teeth spending the past three years switching labels and drastically reconfiguring their sound, consequently putting everything at risk. You will feel the burn.</p>
<p><i>Keep You</i> is Pianos' first album for punk heavyweight Epitaph, which likely means it will be an introduction for many. If that’s your situation, take a few listens to their <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZgtmfaX1zA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">previous</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ut3qOLDmBY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">highlights</a> and know going in to<i> Keep You</i> that Durfey does not scream once. This is important for several reasons, the least of which is that a lot of their older fans are pissed. Because it turns out that he can actually <i>sing</i>, and in a rich, resonant register rarely heard in indie rock and often associated with flannel-clad he-men of various stripes. But these are lyrics that require subtlety and range, as <i>Keep You</i> edges towards acceptance following the four stages of grieving that preceded it. During opener “Ripple Water Shine”, Durfey takes himself to task—“I'm still always slowly waiting for what follows/For what I've learned about being so defined by someone dying,” and going forward, he does raise his voice, but it never cracks. In this music, you process and tolerate your inner turmoil rather than drowning it out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/s3gK1MjTEo/?modal=true"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here’s drummer David Haik</a> performing some of Pianos’ older material. He doesn’t do <i>that</i> either on <i>Keep You</i>; he’s just as active and dexterous, but nowhere near as loud, darting around “Repine” and “Ripple Water Shine”, reminding the listener of the herculean effort they’re putting forward to repress their rage and how that could fail them; they probably won’t lash out, but they might. And these are guitarists who haven’t lost their technical prowess either, they just don’t have to play as fast or loud—Chad McDonald and Mike York rely on fingerpicked patterns and blunt-force chording to alternately constrict, mesmerize, soothe and bludgeon.</p>
<p>So, to recap—no screaming, musicians of conservatory-level aptitude practicing extreme restraint, and producer Will Yip doing his best Peter Katis impersonation, keeping the vocals and percussion at the fore to establish intimacy in an otherwise hall-filling sound. Maybe Pianos Become the Teeth aspire to be the post-hardcore <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national"">National</a>? It’s not far-fetched when you listen back to the outsized, half-sung “Hiding”, which was included on a split 7” with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31567-touche-amore"">Touché Amoré</a>, who would later cover <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/nosleeprecords/touche-amore-available"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Available”</a>. So <i>Keep You</i> is a progression more than a clean break, and the best way to put yourself at the forefront of post-hardcore these days is to prove that you’re kinda done with it.<span> If </span><i>Keep You </i><span>was intended as their way of separating themselves from Touché Amoré and </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31994-la-dispute"">La Dispute</a><span>, they’ve succeeded. But they're now just parallel to each other.</span></p>
<p>Pianos’ craft is certainly at the level of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18598-touche-amore-is-survived-by/"">Is Survived By</a></i> and <i>Rooms of the House</i>, which already feel like future standards, but <i>Keep You</i> doesn’t have the same populist appeal. Everything here will bring a circle pit to a dead halt, while melodic hooks and catharsis are scarce. Moreover, Durfey isn’t a storyteller like La Dispute’s Jordan Dreyer, nor does he speak in rallying cries like Touché Amoré’s Jeremy Bolm. <i>Keep You</i>’s lyricism bears a greater similarity to early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2331-mark-kozelek/"">Mark Kozelek</a>, captivating in its evocative detail and conversely, prone to detail so personal, it’s intimidating. Both aspects are prevalent during the stunning postmortem of “April”, where Durfey drinks from a tin mug with an engraved date and even he’s unsure of its meaning—“What happened 7/31/76 that made them etch your name and the date?/ What'd I miss? It was a Saturday”. Even the person it’s addressed to is unclear—“I got your picture sitting on the sink...Water dripped and hit your cheek in the right spot/ It ruined my week, when I just wanted to wash the filth off.”</p>
<p>Emotionally pulverizing moments like these are so common throughout <i>Keep You</i> that it becomes something close to critic-proof. It’s certainly got its musical shortcomings, but they that shrink in light of its potential to level those who can get past them. Whenever Durfey’s lyrics get too insular, there’s the recognition that by giving so much of himself, the best response is to give right back. Only Durfey and his family know the stories behind lines like, ""I've never had that old Ed size/ I've never had Robert's prison guard skin"", and, ""How odd life would be if you had made it from Elmira to Kansas City/ Instead you cried the whole way, punching the wheel home."" But you can relate if there are people in your past have been reduced to physical signifiers and the geographic signifiers are only relevant in your ability to understand the scale between them, of leaving a suburb for the “big city” and being paralyzed with fear.</p>
<p>When it seems like <i>Keep You</i>’s achromatic desolation is too unrelenting, you catch a reference to memories formed in places like Arcade, New York and Seven Valleys, Pennsylvania. The latter is a town of less than 500 near the Maryland border; I’m guessing you’ve never been because damn near no one has. But if you’ve ever driven through anywhere in the rural mid-Atlantic, particularly during this time of the year, you might recognize the ache and strange hope in the barren trees, endless fields and rundown building showing some kind of resilience in the middle of nowhere. It’s bleak and beautiful in the same way <i>Keep You</i> is, and it gives a lot provided you put your share of effort into it. And so you’ll probably feel exhausted after listening to <i>Keep You</i>; as well you should.</p></div>"|19931.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19931-pianos-become-the-teeth-keep-you/|7.3|Ian Cohen

The second LP from UK-based singer and producer Daniel Woolhouse, <i>Songs</i> isn't quite the folksy confessional its title implies. This isn't <i>Songs of Daniel Woolhouse</i>; you won't find a ""So Long, Marianne"" in its ranks. Instead, <i>Songs</i>—maybe titled so simply as recompense for last year's punny <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17753-deptford-goth-life-after-defo/"">Life After Defo</a>—</i>winds in tender and occasionally cathartic circles, focusing on the fears that accompany an intimacy that's supposed to be permanent.</p>
<p>I mean, how <i>do</i> pessimists pair off? How do you put down your melancholy long enough to say, ""Hey, we'll probably like each other forever""? And once loneliness is legally written out of your record, where do you put the sadness that mysteriously hasn't vanished now that you sleep next to the same person every night? Woolhouse's <i>Songs</i> circles through these problems of commitment as he tries to situate himself as one half of a stable whole.</p>
<p>""Every new day you can set on fire everything that you own,"" Woolhouse sings on ""A Circle"". He can build a house, he knows, but not one that won't burn. This is a guy who's clearly in love and still can't help being a downer. ""I fell down/ Things all look bad to me,"" he sings on ""We Symbolise"". ""Love stings, everything goes,"" he muses on ""The Lovers"". What's more, he's got to weigh in his headspace with another person every day of his life. If there's danger, it's shared, for good or bad: ""I saw the weight in your eye in the corner of the night."" In marriage you get to be loved, but you also have to be constantly seen.</p>
<p>Behind his accented murmurs, Woolhouse fills out <i>Songs</i> with bolder strokes than the pale production of <i>Life After Defo</i>. His synthesized instruments all sound synthesized— strings, drums, flutes, and horns plop directly out of a keyboard, and he does nothing to obscure it or make any stab at realism. Acoustic instruments would have projected a sense of collaboration, of others sharing a room and playing with him. Surrounded by fakes, Woolhouse sounds completely alone.</p>
<p>It's there in his solitude that he can get at the roots of his worries. Woolhouse knows that for some of us, getting what you've always wanted prompts the question of whether or not you're even worthy of it in the first place. Throughout <i>Songs</i>, he yearns to be better—to be the sort of guy who deserves the love he wants. ""Make me good,"" he pleads on the beautifully revolving ""Near to a River"". ""Make me kind. Lift my body up. Make me kind."" He repeats the words like a mantra as the song overflows, carrying him away on its surf.</p>
<p>Even within the safety of companionship, the outside world threatens danger. ""Find each other, cause it's all we've got,"" Woolhouse sings on ""A Circle"". When he gets far enough outside of his own head, his expressions of love are charmingly simple: ""You're a human, and I like you the best."" That's it. That's all there is. He cuts out the sparkle from romance, knowing that it alone won't save him. But that doesn't mean he can't take root in it, can't wear it like armor. ""We've got peace in us,"" he concludes on ""Two Hearts"", the first in the album's delicate two-song finish. ""Love, love is enough."" Then, on ""A Shelter, a Weapon"": ""If you want me, you can have me 'til the end of time."" There's no guarantee anything lasts that long, but he's willing to fight for something like forever.</p></div>"|19916.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19916-deptford-goth-songs/|6.8|Sasha Geffen

In 1980 and 1981, ACR's singles </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnqN-rGM3J8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Do the Du""</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> and </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRVORzxxm5s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shack Up""</a><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> were even getting played at some of those dance clubs.</span></p>
<p>After singer Martha Tilson joined up to give trumpeter Simon Topping a break from his reluctant position as frontman, A Certain Ratio's six-piece lineup recorded and self-produced their third album, released at the beginning of 1982. Thirty-two years later, it still sounds like no other record: it's either that era's creepiest, boggiest dance album or its funkiest smear of brittle art-noise.</p>
<p>One axis of the <i>Sextet</i>-era band is Tilson, who's as odd a vocalist as they could have picked. She's perpetually lagging behind the beat and beneath the pitches for which she's reaching, and she swallows her words, as if she's struggling to repeat them to herself. (Tilson's an acquired taste as a singer, but awfully distinctive.) Topping's one major turn on the mic here is similarly strange: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghHaN5KbOe4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Skipscada""</a>, a two-minute flurry of Brazilian percussion and trilling whistles, on which he scat-sings tunelessly, rolling his R's with infectious glee.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kerr and Johnson are doing their damnedest to play funk as hard as the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybrRgAqiZ3c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sugar Hill Records house band</a>--hitting precise, clipped grooves while their bandmates run interference with haphazardly flung splashes of atonal piano and dissonant horn bleats. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihx87_WkVQg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Gum""</a> is produced like a good-time boogie track: Topping and Martin Moscrop's trumpets tootle out a soul-revue fanfare, Johnson and Kerr punctuate every few lines with get-down flourishes, and the whole band contributes to a samba breakdown. But everything's out of tune with everything else, and Tilson's distantly wailing ""I'm sorrreeee... I can't remember your name..."" If anyone was waiting for another ""Do the Du"", they'd have to keep waiting.</p>
<p>What they'd have been waiting for, actually, was <i>Sextet</i>'s centerpiece—just not in this form. On the album, ""Knife Slits Water"" is a seven-and-a-half-minute, two-chord mantra: Kerr works endless variations on a little bass figure as Tilson mutters about sex, her voice doubled by an eerie pitch-displacement effect, and somebody makes a bunch of prickly noise with a kalimba. By the end of 1982, they'd re-record it as a single in the wake of Tilson's departure, and the terrific and even longer <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP7fE6rZelo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">12-inch version</a> (included here), sung by Johnson, recasts the <i>Sextet</i> version's uncontrollable tremors as boogie fever.</p>
<p>This new reissue appends a 13-track bonus disc to the original album. Besides the ""Knife"" 12-inch (and its B-side, a near-instrumental Sugar Hill pastiche with the Kabbalistic title <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIZfP2_wxu8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Kether Hot Knives""</a>), it includes the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNmQdgAM6BI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Waterline""</a> single that introduced Tilson when it immediately preceded <i>Sextet</i>, a couple of meandering dub experiments the band originally released under the name Sir Horatio, and BBC radio sessions from 1981 and 1982. They all illuminate the band's curious fascinations and tensions in that period, but <i>Sextet</i> itself—a gorgeous mess, slumped against the back wall of the best dance club in town—is no less mysterious for the illumination.</p></div>"|19835.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19835-a-certain-ratio-sextet/|8.1|Douglas Wolk

You will not like what you hear. Here’s a brief, but nearly complete list of people who are exempt, as handed down by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p"">El-P</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5605-killer-mike"">Killer Mike</a> on <i>RTJ2</i>: Malcolm X, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5406-ugk"">UGK</a> (Pimp C posthumously given the Lifetime Achievement Award), MJG, the Weathermen (both the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0Xpwzkuc04"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hip-hop</a> and militant factions), Gangsta Boo, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3707-scarface"">Scarface</a> (that's Brad Jordan, Al Pacino's is noticeably absent here), Zack De La Rocha, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3123-the-notorious-big"">Biggie</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5023-2pac"">2Pac</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3002-nas"">Nas</a> (ca. 1993 and also 2014, as this is being released on his Mass Appeal imprint). That’s really about it.</p>
<p>Otherwise, when El-P sneers, ""You want a whore in a white dress/ I want a wife with a thong"" during ""Angel Duster"", it’s a metaphor that implicates just about everybody in his blast radius—conservative and liberal politicians who hide their bullshit ideals behind ""values,"" religious figures doing the same, beta-male types using performative tolerance as a front for their passive-aggressive misogyny, or just anyone who’s full of shit. For <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31319-run-the-jewels"">Run the Jewels</a>, these people are what cocaine was to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/960-clipse"">Clipse</a>, sex to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne"">Lil Wayne</a>, clothing to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/937-camron/"">Cam’ron</a>—their domain, their muse, a seemingly endless source of inspiration for the most viciously realized rap album of 2014 and most other years.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that <i>RTJ2</i> is an <i>album</i>—it’s on a real label and you can pay money to own it. And the transition from mixtape-to-album explains every progression El-P and Killer Mike have made in the past year. Think of it as the <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9658-hell-hath-no-fury"">Hell Hath No Fury</a></i> to <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18219-run-the-jewels-run-the-jewels/"">Run the Jewels</a></i>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11708-we-got-it-4-cheap-vol-1-vol-2""><i>We Got It 4 Cheap</i></a>—the latter were freewheeling collaborations that introduced commercially exiled veterans to a new audience of microphone fiends and completely reframed their public perception. The sequel feels more like a statement, taking into account crucial constructs like sequencing, judiciously granted guest spots, and pacing. But Run the Jewels exchange Clipse’s unrelenting, and highly specific mean streak for a righteous anger that has a gleeful, conspiratorial edge—Run the Jewels<i> get it </i>and you <i>get </i>them.</p>
<p>This is one of the more readily apparent aspects of Run the Jewels’ development as a functioning group; they were a festival act from the start and <i>RTJ2</i> is a rare hip-hop record that sounds like it was created with live performance in mind. They’re two guys with dexterous, booming voices over blaring production that’s percussive, abrasive, and dynamic. The first half is uncut aggression for any situation in transit, the first thing you can reach for if you’re getting elbowed on the subway or cut off in traffic driving down I-85. As <i>RTJ2</i> progresses, it’s still the same detritus that filled El-P’s iron galaxy in the past, only now, the forms are recognizable and warm: dub’s echo and synth bass swiped from<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13407-amnesiac-special-collectors-edition""> <i>Amnesiac</i></a> commingle on ""All My Life"", vocal snippets are taken from <i>Police Academy</i>’s Michael Winslow on ""Oh My Darling Don’t Cry"", and Zack De La Rocha on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17164-run-the-jewels-close-your-eyes-and-count-to-fuck-ft-zack-de-la-rocha"">""Close Your Eyes (And Count to Fuck)""</a> before the real thing comes through to spit some goofy, try-hard ""Bombtrack""-style aggro braggadocio that doubles as the best verse of his life. On the whole, <i>RTJ2</i> is El-P’s most accessible and rangy production to date and he’s hit a stride that recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth"">Sonic Youth</a> in 1987 or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective"">Animal Collective</a> in 2004, the point where a celebrated noise terrorist starts to embrace and challenge their audience rather than simply testing their patience.</p>
<p>Run the Jewels are undeniably a crossover hip-hop act, and cognizant of their unique position—Mike and El's career-changing 2012 albums respectively came courtesy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16537-killer-mike-rap-music/"">Cartoon Network</a> and a former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16641-cancer-for-cure/"">blues label</a> that spent years claiming the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys/"">Black Keys</a> as their most ""contemporary"" act. Both have been around long enough to recognize they share stages with EDM acts and fans with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug"">Young Thug</a>; rather than seeing them as threats, they view them as inspiration and competition, as it’s the commercial vanguard who are fucking with language and syntax as much as Def Jux and Dungeon Family ever were.</p>
<p>And therein is the most important lack of distinction on <i>RTJ2</i>, that between ""old school"" and ""new school,"" ""lyrical"" and whatever its opposite is, as if hip-hop isn’t a living, evolving organism. El and Mike deliver both blows to the sternum and elbow-jabs to the ribs; there are hours worth of instantly quotable, clever ignorance, as in El-P’s already much-loved request that haters, ""Can all run naked backwards through a field of dicks."" Meanwhile, Mike’s verse on ""All Due Respect"" is a blacked-out, brilliant clinic in rhythm, wordplay and content—""This year, we iller than a nun in a cumshot/ Getting double-penetrated in a dope spot/ By two hard pipe hittin’ niggas/ On the orders of Marcellus to the soundtrack of 2Pac/ I beat you to a pulp, no fiction/ Tarantino flow, new Jules (Jewels) and Vincent.""</p>
<p>Throughout <i>RTJ2</i>, the duo appear limitless in their vocal capacity, whether working as a tag team, storytellers, or engaging in battle-rap one-upmanship. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17059-run-the-jewels-blockbuster-night-pt-1/"">""Blockbuster Night, Pt. 1""</a> is all razzle dazzle alliteration, while ""Oh My Darling Don’t Cry"" compiles a career’s worth of flows, from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX6K7waag5Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""We Dem Boyz""</a>-derived ""hol’ up""s! to Adidas-scuffing tough talk to the triplet-flipping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16612-future-move-that-dope-ft-pharrell-pusha-t-and-casino"">""Move that Dope""</a> cadence. Any sort of geographical or philosophical or stylistic boundary that stood between the two no longer exists, if it ever did; El is just as likely to spit Dirty South double time raps about strippers as Mike is to wax about obscure historical figures and governmental conspiracies.</p>
<p><i>RTJ2</i>is darker, bolder, and longer than its predecessor, though still clocking in at a bullshit-free 39 minutes; the difference between this and most sequels is that this one actually has a plot. Both El-P and Killer Mike are pushing 40, career artists spitting grown-ass raps about grown-ass problems. They came of age during a time when ""the black CNN"" was actually something worth aspiring to and hip-hop isn’t the one that failed to keep up its end of the bargain; I don’t know if they finally found the plane or have moved onto 24-hour coverage of the ebola panic, but these days you might as well be watching <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5AYMiAdqhQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Channel Zero</a>. Comedians are now delivering the hardest news anyway, and <i>RTJ2</i> is more ""Last Week Tonight"", ditching the ironic distance that typified political humor and going straight for the killshot.</p>
<p>As with<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32145-vince-staples""> Vince Staples</a>’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17090-vince-staples-hands-up/"">""Hands Up""</a>, ""Early"" is live reportage of police brutality that wasn’t directly inspired by the death of Michael Brown. Which is what makes it even more frightening. The racial dynamic of Run the Jewels is occasionally played for laughs on <i>RTJ2; </i>here, it's acknowledged in a powerful, unspoken way, as Mike’s role is that of the street preacher, empowered by the support of his people, whereas El plays the wilderness prophet, his madness spurred by the realization his craziest thoughts are coming to pass. Mike is harassed in his home over trivial weed possession and taken away in cuffs while the neighbors record the scene on their cell phones. Meanwhile, El-P walks the streets of New York untouched by the police, but affected by his own powerlessness. He closes his mournful verse with ""They’ll watch you walk to the store they’re recording/ But didn’t record a cop when he shot no warning,"" concluding the cycle of violence with, ""Go home, go to sleep, up again early""—the last line echoing ""it was everyday America and that’s all"" from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4050-sun-kil-moon"">Sun Kil Moon</a>’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5dWBPsru-Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Pray for Newtown""</a>, another anti-gun protest whose headlines were pulled from the past and has its relevance renewed throughout 2014 <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/28/us/washington-school-shooting-claims-another-victim-gia-soriano.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in regular and increasingly dispiriting intervals.</a></p>
<p>A similar splitscreen occurs on ""Crown""; Mike’s verse is based on a true story, recalling his days of slinging cocaine to a pregnant woman just to make ends meet, praying for God to give him a lane out of this life. Once the kid is born, Mike sighs, ""Heard he was normal 'til three and then he stopped talking,"" racked with guilt until he meets the woman a few years later and she relieves him of his burden—""I’ve been redeemed/ I found in Christ/ Whatever it take, I hope you find it, Mike."" Meanwhile, El takes a surprisingly empathetic tone towards an army ensign who himself was just trying to find his own lane, pitying the man for voluntarily surrendering his free will to become a human weapon but understanding the choice in light of the mental torture. Whereas the broad scope of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16537-killer-mike-rap-music/""><i>R.A.P. Music</i></a> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16641-cancer-for-cure/"">Cancer for Cure</a> </i>made <i>Run the Jewels</i> seem like a one-off lark, the interaction between El and Mike on ""Crown"" and ""Early"" makes those records somehow sound incomplete in retrospect.</p>
<p>But these moments of reflection are wisely paced within <i>RTJ2</i>’s otherwise relentless assault. ""Close Your Eyes (And Count to Fuck)"" is the hardest, most <i>celebratory</i> track about starting a prison riot since <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM5_6js19eM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos""</a>; sulfur burns and wardens are waterboarded, as, ""We killin’ em for freedom cause they tortured us for boredom/ And even if some good ones die, fuck it, the Lord’ll sort 'em."" The most unconventional social study occurs on ""Love Again (Akinyele Back)""; as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus""><i>Yeezus</i></a> proved, consensual, unorthodox sex is instantly heard as misogyny and the he-said, she-said hook of, ""She want that dick in her mouth all day"" certainly courts trouble. At least until Gangsta Boo steals the track with a verse of even greater demands and vulgarity, in the same way she made filthy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4388-three-6-mafia"">Three 6 Mafia</a> songs like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brHkg1dRCJU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tongue Ring""</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hk1XpJGzgA8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hit It From the Back""</a> sound strangely progressive in their gender politics.</p>
<p>Referring to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mAJU_ZKhEM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Put It in Your Mouth""</a>, the most infamous track of ""Love Again""’s parenthetical namesake, El-P <a href=""https://twitter.com/therealelp/status/526740116916948992"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">commented</a>, ""i feel lucky to have grown up in a time when filthy/stupid/funny rap songs could be hits like that one.""<i> RTJ2</i> isn’t backwards-looking or a throwback, but any record whose most notable guest appearances come from former members of Three 6 Mafia and Rage Against the Machine is nostalgic to some degree. There’s also the hovering influence of not just <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3086-nwa"">N.W.A.</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3411-public-enemy/"">Public Enemy</a>, but also less critically revered innovators like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/20777-geto-boys"">Geto Boys</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1823-goodie-mob/"">Goodie Mob</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27881-8ball/"">8Ball &amp; MJG</a>, Southern acts whose intelligence and complexity felt natural, wisdom from stoops, liquor stores, and street corners that translated to college dorms without ever presenting themselves as ""art"" or ""conscious"" rappers.</p>
<p>As much as El-P and Killer Mike want to distance themselves from being seen as role models, they are; their experience just happens to sound a hell of a lot like the truth. Towards the end of ""Lie, Cheat, Steal"", Killer Mike digs a shallow grave for deposed Clippers despot Donald Sterling, but not entirely for his horrifying racism; what truly offends Mike is seeing the guy <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO0hX8ukuS4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blubbering on TV</a>, giving apologies he doesn’t mean in the slightest, outing himself as another ""prisoner of privilege"" in a system where even a billionaire isn’t in control of his destiny. And the common thread that ties <i>RTJ2</i> with some of the other widely-celebrated albums of 2014—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18860-sun-kil-moon-benji/""><i>Benji</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19326-swans-to-be-kind""><i>To Be Kind</i></a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18821-beyonce-beyonce/""><i>Beyoncé</i></a>—is that each is an example of a seasoned artist using their financial and artistic capital to take control of the means of production and distribution, putting the least amount of distance between themselves and their vision. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/34613-company-flow-talk-funcrusher-plus-reissue/"">""Independent as fuck""</a> indeed; sounding like nothing else and answering to nobody but its creators, <i>Run the Jewels 2</i> is in a class by itself.</p></div>"|19968.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19968-run-the-jewels-run-the-jewels-2/|9.0|Ian Cohen

The Austin-via-Houston group wasn't together all that long—they released two full-lengths and some singles, and by the time of that second album, they'd already broken up. Their short run may have contributed to a feeling of anonymity. To me, they were different from relative peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3406-the-promise-ring/"" target=""_blank"">Promise Ring</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2477-lifetime/"">Lifetime</a>, groups that seemed communal; Mineral weren't a guilty pleasure, more like a prized secret. They've been described as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3986-sunny-day-real-estate/"">Sunny Day Real Estate</a> rip-off, but that never seemed quite right to me—there was more lo-fi jangle and hiss to Mineral's songs, and the production wasn't as big. In a way, Mineral were more aligned to the darker pop of mid-1990s indie-rock groups like fellow Texans Bedhead, and they didn't strike me as quite so ""hardcore."" The connection with SDRE that <i>did</i> exist, though, was in the angsty, acrobatic vocals of Chris Simpson, which were in the same vein as Jeremy Enigk's, but rougher. </p>
<p>Take, for instance, ""MD"", the B-side to 1996's ""February"" 7"", included on this new retrospective,<i> 1994-1998 - The Complete Collection</i>. On it, Simpson is about to visit his older brother (""It's good to know we haven't outgrown the love we shared as children""), and meet the woman that brother plans to marry. He talks about the secret language they shared at a young age, when they dressed up as Batman and Robin for Halloween (""Everybody laughed at us and said we had it wrong 'cause you were the taller one""), and ends the track with all the force he can muster: ""She's beautiful/ And I know that you'll be happy/ So take this as my blessing/ Wrapped up with all the love that I can send/ 'Cause you are my brother/ My friend/ And my superior/ Till the end."" On paper it reads like a note you'd send to a sibling; in song, it's towering.</p>
<p>The emotions here are emo, no doubt. This is the kind of music where people yell ""I stand on a building and throw up my arms to the sky/ I swallow my pride"" and ""This is the last song that I should ever sing/ Just one more time and I'll shut my mouth forever"" amid huge crashing guitars. Simpson sings about coming of age, feeling unloved and embarrassed (""I bring it on myself/ I know I bring it on myself""), and also the innocence of youth, being in love, loving your family, and what those connections and relationships mean. There are stabs at '90s DIY politics, and he articulates being human and lost in great detail: ""When I'm finally naked and standing in the sunlight/ I'll look back at all of this selfishness and foolish pride/ And laugh at myself."" The melodrama, in general, is great, and the music around it rises to the occasion. The songs are intense, catchy, over-loaded with feedback and beauty, and meant to be yelled.</p>
<p>Though they didn't release much, their two proper albums are markedly different. The sound of 1998's <i>EndSerenading</i> was softer, and more glistening than 1997's <i>Power of Failing</i>. It hinted at what Simpson would do with bassist Jeremy Gomez in their next band, the Gloria Record, and perhaps, in retrospect, suggests why the group went in two different directions: guitarist Scott McCarver and drummer Gabriel Wiley formed Imbroco then went on to found other projects separately. <i>EndSerenading</i> album was a pop, and not a lo-fi or punk gesture, and it's just not as compelling as <i>Failing</i>. It has plenty of good moments, but it can also feel overthought and staid. Part of what makes <i>The Power of Failing</i> a classic is that its raw feel and execution matches its emotions.</p>
<p>Mineral formed in 1994, and released some singles and toured like crazy, so <i>Failing</i> felt like a culmination. Conversely, <i>EndSerenading</i>, which they recorded with producer Mark Trombino (Blink-182, Jimmy Eat World), felt, at times, like a lukewarm new beginning. They were supposed to do a third album for Interscope, but, of course, it never happened. Which, honestly, is probably for the best. There's momentum on <i>Failing</i> that was already getting hemmed in on <i>End</i>, not to mention the addition of labored song titles like ""LoveLetterTypewriter"", ""TheLastWordIsRejoice"", and ""&amp;Serenading"". It's easy to imagine them becoming even shinier and more staid on a major label debut.</p>
<p>Not to say <i>End</i> is a failure. Title aside, ""LoveLetterTypewriter"" is an excellent, moving opening track, and one of their best. Simpson sings the words patiently, and with more refinement than in the past (and, honestly, more like Enigk): ""Summer unfolded like a tapestry/ And you were there as you have always been/ There glowing where the sky meets with the trees/ Air softly crowing, singing fears to sleep/ Will you ever know how much I love you for that?"" It's a constant build that crashes into the next track, ""Palisade"", a song that serves as climax and release before moving into another direction. It's an exciting one-two: these pieces pick up where <i>Failing</i> left off; the formula is updated, but not abandoned. The same goes for the group-singing of the next song, ""Gjs"". But then, they take it down a few notches, often ending up too mid-tempo and over-long. The music remains pretty, and even knottier, but feels less life-affirming.</p>
<p>For instance, the spacious, ultimately clamoring ""&amp;Serenading"" would be a good closer <span>(""When I was a boy I saw things/ That no one else could see/ So why am I so blind at 22?""), but instead of the gorgeously repeated finale (""the sound of the driving snow that drives me home to you""), it's the downtempo, shimmering acoustics and humming vocals of the pretty-but-slight ""TheLastWordIsRejoice"" that serve as our exit. Like the forced titling, it's inoffensive, but feels unnecessary, as do other grown-up touches on </span><i>End</i><span>. That line from ""&amp;Serenading"" quoted above reminds you just how young these guys were, though, and why they might feel the need to ratchet it up on their sophomore record, considering the attention given to the first.</span></p>
<p>Not that it mattered, of course. They ended and then, as bands do now, they reunited; this remastered two-disc compilation is a good way to hear it all in one sitting (the reissues are also available, without the bonus tracks, on vinyl). None of the alternate take bonus tracks here are especially riveting, and the covers of the Psychedelic Furs' ""Love My Way"" and Willie Nelson's ""Crazy"" are mostly forgettable (the latter's actually pretty bad), but it's great to have the relative lo-fi ""Rubber Legs"", from the 1997 (<i>Don't Forget To) Breathe</i> compilation, the punked-up ""Sadder Star"", which appears on the 1997 <i>First Crush</i> compilation, and, most importantly, the 1996 ""February"" b/w ""M.D."" single, which includes a couple of their best songs.</p>
<p>When I listened to the<i> Power of Failing</i> in real time back then, it was often on a cassette that I'd dubbed from the vinyl, for when I was traveling. Because of that, I always thought ""February"" and ""M.D."" were part of the proper record, and was surprised to realize they weren't. That's just one example of how music becomes personal, and shifts according to your own relationship with it. It's something you're faced with when the music of your youth keeps resurfacing, and it can be weird, but also somehow touching. For instance, it's been good going back to these records so many years later, and realizing I find myself moved more by the songs about family than the ones about wondering on roofs alone. </p></div>"|19688.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19688-mineral-the-power-of-failingendserenading/|8.5|Brandon Stosuy

The 23-year-old Detroit native, named for her high school footwear preference, is matter-of-fact to the point where you can’t help but to trust her completely. Part of that comes from her not-so-distant backpacker past: <i><a href=""http://dejaloaf.bandcamp.com/album/just-do-it"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Just Do It</a></i>, her self-released 2012 solo debut, was full of Midwestern earnestness and diaristic boom-bap somewhere between Slum Village and popped-Polo Kanye. Stylistically, that stuff couldn’t be further from ""Try Me"", Dej’s sweet-and-sour breakaway hit that gently threatens to turn enemies into a variety of Italian delicacies—a track that garnered the attention of Drake and secured her a deal with Columbia Records. But though <i>Sell Sole</i>, her first release in the spotlight, is devoid of the literal <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdPPkarI4zg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">college dropout jams</a> of her debut, that sense of confessional non-fiction lingers. As her songs have grown weirder, her lyrics have kept that idiosyncratic bluntness and a repulsion for theatrics. When some hometown detractors ask, early in the tape, why she insists on stunting on them so hard, her response is pragmatic: “I don’t know.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Sell Sole</i> represents a transitional stage for Dej, documenting the full gradient of her shift from straightforward raps to hustler’s nursery rhymes. This isn’t to say that her more traditional songs are lacking: she can rap, as immediately evident in no-hook, no-nonsense opener ""Bird Call"". Her voice is light and gauzy, sometimes a little wispy but always clear and authoritative; lyrically she’s clever but restrained, delivering deadpan jabs in a half-smirk (""Diamonds dancing like Omarion in <i>You Got Served</i>""). But though her rappin’-ass rapping is accomplished, Dej seems to have sensed that these songs are not likely to have the impact of ""Try Me"". Sure enough, the highlights of the tape are when Dej sings, either in half-rapped hybrid (on woozy crew love number ""We Be On It"") or in full-on R&amp;B mode (done best on ""Easy Love"", the star-crossed soulmate of Chief Keef’s cult favorite ""Citgo"").</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Even in its most aspirational moments, <i>Sell Sole</i> is clouded with a pervasive sense of mourning. Throughout the tape, Dej recalls bits of herself she has lost, most notably through the death of her father, cousin, and grandmother. There is no real climax, no <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KCWqnldEag"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""HYFR""</a> moment. Instead, catharsis comes from the act of telling things as they are, quietly absorbing the suffering in her surroundings and soberly reflecting them back outward. On ""We Be On It"", when Dej borrows Beyoncé’s self-love rallying cry, ""I woke up like this,"" it’s rendered calm and almost existential: ""Okay, here I am.""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Dej’s cool realism and off-hand threats of violence have been compared to Chicago drill, but Lil Durk is her only real peer in the genre. Durk, too, is a technically great rapper when the occasion calls for it, though like Dej, his best songs often don’t. Instead, both have an improvisational knack for melody and a tendency toward unshowy, personal lyricism. Her most direct influence, though, may be the late rapper/producer Speaker Knockerz. The quietly trend-setting South Carolina native developed a solid Midwest following before his unexpected death earlier this year, and Dej’s ""On My Own"" in particular is a direct descendent of his uncharacteristically somber last single, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPrmjTSiqBs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Lonely""</a>.</p>
<p>Wisely, there are relatively few features here, but the tape’s most prominent guests serve as a study in contrasts. On tape highlight ""Blood"", known hyperbolist Young Thug, whose power often lies in his gift for caricature, acts as Dej’s foil; where Thug thrills with his unpredictability, zipping from wistful sing-song to geeked-up double-time flow, Dej’s comforting evenness keeps things planted firmly on earth. Most enlightening is the remixed version of ""Try Me"", featuring guest verses from Remy Ma and Ty Dolla $ign along with an entirely revamped verse from Dej. Remy sounds right at home, gladly assimilating into Dej’s universe, but Ty’s contributions sound flat and unnatural. Though he traffics in a similar mode of rap-R&amp;B hybridization, his breed of detached, fuck-your-feelings melodicism is a sore thumb in the midst of a tape so unguarded and unconcerned with coolness.

The answer is no. They did it anyway. On <i>Lifer</i>, the Baltimore band’s follow-up to 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16638-natural-history/""><i>Natural History</i></a>, ""AOL"" is the most blatant reference to that bygone decade of dialup Internet and weirdo alt-rock that made <i>In Utero</i> sound safe. <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/1152-drive-like-jehu"">Drive Like Jehu</a>, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/1725-girls-against-boys/"">Girls Against Boys</a>, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/451-brainiac/"">Brainiac</a>, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/731-chavez/"">Chavez</a>, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/4431-us-maple/"">U.S. Maple</a>: This is Dope Body’s deliciously warped version of '90s pop history, and accordingly, they’ve been able to pull that into a tight knot of noise that doesn’t actually sound too retro at all; there are sonic nods here and there, some obvious and others of the Easter egg variety, but mostly they’ve managed to refresh a subversive, aggressively squirrelly approach to racket-making that never had the chance to become played out in the first place. ""AOL"" is as good an example as any on <i>Lifer</i>. It slinks, thrashes, boils over, shrinks down, gets jazzy, and is stabbed with jagged hooks by singer Andrew Laumann, who babbles and slurs while guitarist Zachary Utz surgically cripples his own riffs like a true '90s guitar antihero.</p>
<p>Despite all that, ""AOL"" is not the most thrilling demonstration of Dope Body’s prowess. A foaming-at-the-mouth intro lapses into a leaden breakdown; rather than dynamic, it feels slapdash. Most of<i> Lifer </i>is better, but there’s a marked drop in energy to the album as compared the band’s prior work. Yet somehow, the record sprints along at a brisk pace; that velocity, though, doesn’t seem to go anywhere. ""Repo Man"" splits a simmering, <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"">Fugazi</a>-esque buildup with Laumann’s mush-mouthed, vaguely angry poetics, but none of it coagulates into a single focused hook or mood. On ""Nu Sensation"", tar-pit guitar stews in its own mock-stoner-rock filth while the vocals meander, ramble, babble, and attach to nothing.</p>
<p>When <i>Lifer</i> clicks, though, it’s unkillable. ""Hired Gun"" slices open its own means of entry with Utz’s needling, staccato harmonics; Laumann’s lax snarl hits peak slacker charisma, and the swaggering riffage mixed with wah-pedal leads imagines <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"">J. Mascis</a> jamming with <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3588-rocket-from-the-crypt"">Rocket from the Crypt</a>. Things get downright punk on ""Toy"", although the album’s angriest track, ""Day by Day"", scratches and swarms without fully blowing the hatch off. ""Rare Air"" is the album’s best song, a snakelike sashay through pinging effects and a dub-worthy bassline from John Jones, formerly of fellow Baltimore band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30110-roomrunner/"">Roomrunner</a>. But even then, Utz’s thick, surfy riff could have come straight off a <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"">Pixies</a> outtake. ""Wanna be original/ Don’t wanna be a wannabe,"" Laumann sings, and it’s not clear at all if the irony is lost on him.</p>
<p>Laumann, at his worst, can lapse into a frat-scat leer that comes across unsettlingly like Anthony Kiedis; he goes there on the slinky, smoky ""Echo"", and it doesn’t help that in the lyrics of ""Toy"", the three words ""under the bridge"" actually appear in that order. If <i>Lifer</i> were either catchier or crazier, it would be far better. As it stands, it feels like a placeholder, something to pass the time until a more rounded, less pastiche-leaning version of Dope Body gets dialed up. As soon as they figure out that they don't have to lift wholesale chunks of inspiration from any of their heroes in order to make their point, they may find a way to more creatively harness their '90s worship. Until then, <i>Lifer</i> has just enough life of its own.</p></div>"|19959.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19959-dope-body-lifer/|6.9|Jason Heller

That’s not in the simple sense that this low, fluttering signal is the start of the second one-track album from the Chicago chamber doom-and-drone collective Wrekmeister Harmonies. And it’s not that this is the origin from which everything else unfolds. It’s that, almost immediately, you can sense where these 34 minutes <i>might</i> be headed before they’ve had the chance to grow beyond a single note. Recorded in a church and then re-recorded from playback in a lakeside lighthouse, the organ seems haunted, like a ghostlight fading in and out of the middle distance. It’s less outwardly threatening than eerie, a warning to proceed with caution. Turns out, that premonition is correct: The end of <i>Then It All Came Down</i> is a waking nightmare.</p>
<p><i>Then It All Came Down</i> takes its title from a 1973 Truman Capote interview with Bobby Beausoleil, the budding entertainer-turned-murderer who the author called ""the key to the mystery of the homicidal escapades of the so-called Manson family."" But J.R. Robinson, the mastermind of Wrekmeister Harmonies, didn’t only lift the name of the Capote essay. He lifted its spirit, or more exactly, the key question behind Beausoleil and the Helter Skelter mob at large: How did a bunch of drug-doing, orgy-inducing kids with visions of stardom and famous acquaintances turn so decidedly dark?</p>
<p><a href=""http://thrilljockey.com/assets/library/13038/Beau%20Soleil%20by%20JR%20Robinson.doc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In an accompanying essay</a> that traces the links from Aleister Crowley’s credos and teachings to hippies, Manson and the whole lot, Robinson grapples with that lingering concern and its spiritual underpinnings. ""Rather than earning their spot in the sun by fighting their way through the darkness, [Manson and Beausoleil] reversed the sequence, starting with the positive and working towards the negative,"" he writes. This piece, which moves in the time of one sitcom episode from that docile drone into a noise-flanked doom fisticuffs, is Robinson’s musical representation of such perversion. At the start, <i>Then It All Came Down</i> suggests a world of possibilities; by its end, the only available outcome seems to be some form of purgatory, a nihilistic vacuum of supposed free will.</p>
<p>The process, then, is obvious, even predictable: <i>Then It All Came Down</i> moves from rather gentle tones to complete miasmic atonality. But the path between those poles is surprising, stepwise and involved, the chief feat of Robinson as a bandleader and composer. To complete this piece, <a href=""http://www.decibelmagazine.com/featured/wrekmeister-harmonies-announces-then-it-all-came-down/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robinson recruited 20 musicians</a> and recorded them in sessions scattered across America and Canada. There’s the pick-up-and-check-out acoustic strummer Ryley Walker and the meticulous Codeine/Come guitarist Chris Brokaw. Infamous black metal madman Wrest contributes vocals, as do Lydia Lane Stout, Chanel Pease and Kate Spelling, an entrancing trio of sirens. There’s a string quartet and the riveting Chicago doom band Indian, assisted by collaborator and power electronics savage Mark Solotroff. Robinson folds them all into his inquires, actors and actresses yielding to the director’s vision.</p>
<p>However ominous it may seem, this music is, at first, august. Walker scatters florid, raga-like lines across an amoeboid dream of tinkling bells, drifting organ and harmonizing voices that softly sing “Beautiful sun,” the translation of Beausoleil’s French name. The action swells until it collapses into a din of windswept noise. Wrest growls nocturnal imprecations through the hiss. Strings and horns soon pull the action toward an existential crossroads: Which of those embryonic elements will prevail? The answer emerges through electric guitars, locked in feedback, and militant drums, locked into a lumber that shakes the frame. The finale is as punishing as the peaks of doom metal itself. The ensemble’s patience suggests the successes of the Ocean, and the vocal scowl of Indian’s Dylan O’Toole recalls Khanate’s ever-acerbic Alan Dubin. In the end, only this destruction was feasible.</p>
<p>To match the colossal approach of his releases, Robinson has taken care to ensure that the physical products for both of his albums mirrored the grandeur of the music. You could get lost, for instance, in the illustration of 2013’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18263-wrekmeister-harmonies-youve-always-meant-so-much-to-me/""><i>You’ve Always Meant So Much to Me</i></a>, where cliffs of ice sublimated into bulbous clouds. The same holds for <i>Then It All Came Down</i>, in which a split-panel piece by Simon Fowler links heaven and hell in refracted, infinite detail. You can imagine the art as the machinery for Beausoleil’s time-lapse depravity.</p>
<p>What’s more, the compact disc version backs Robinson’s new work with last year’s debut, previously available only on vinyl. The combined set makes for a long listen but a telling one, too: As he harnesses new tools to power these documents of personal or public descent, Robinson’s audacity and imagination are expanding. <i>Then It All Came Down </i>is shorter than <i>You’ve Always Meant So Much to Me</i>, but it feels bigger, bolder and more nuanced, so unified as to appear oblivious to the experimental/metal divide that this project’s previous work so carefully traced. It’s as though Robinson has just now begun to touch on the real possibilities of the principles at play within Wrekmeister Harmonies.</p></div>"|19740.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19740-wrekmeister-harmonies-then-it-all-came-down/|7.5|Grayson Haver Currin

In a performance at Krakow's Unsound Festival earlier this month, the rattle of a film projector added a layer of instant nostalgia to her murky swirls of voice and guitar. Much of the time, Grouper's music is so diffuse that there's no longer any distinction between center and margin anyway, no difference between foreground and background.</p>
<p>That is not the case on <i>Ruins</i>, the first album from the Portland, Oregon, musician since last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17571-the-man-who-died-in-his-boat-dragging-a-dead-deer-up-a-hill/""><i>The Man Who Died in His Boat</i></a>. Here, the incidental noises—crickets, croaking frogs, thunder and rain, and, at one point, the unmistakable beep of a microwave oven that fired up after a blackout in the house where she was recording—serve primarily to underscore how stark the music is, unadorned and pocked with vast silences. <i>Ruins</i> is Grouper's ""unplugged"" record, essentially, as much as that might sound odd for a musician who has always put acoustic guitar and piano and voice at the core of her work. Here, however, she foreswears the looping pedals and the innumerable layers of fuzz that are just as essential to her aesthetic. What we're left with is achingly beautiful and, given the intensely private nature of most of Grouper's work—on stage, she often plays sitting down, crouched over in order to manipulate her effects pedals, her face hidden in shadow—almost unnervingly direct.</p>
<p>The emotional core of the album is the four melancholy songs for piano and voice, which are complemented by two instrumentals of a similar mood. Rarely have Harris' lyrics been so clearly audible, and rarely, if ever, has love been so plainly the focus of her songwriting. ""I hear you calling and I wanna go/ Run straight into the valleys of your arms,"" she sings on ""Holding"", her multitracked close harmonies reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"">Low</a> circa <i>The Curtain Hits the Cast</i>. On the devastating ""Clearing"", she sings, ""Every time I see you/ I have to pretend I don't""; on ""Call Across Rooms"", she has a change of heart: ""I have a present to give you/ When we finally figure it out."" (""The song is on one level very plain and literal, about a letter I wrote for someone I loved and could not get along with,"" she told <a href=""http://www.vogue.com/1357779/grouper-ruins-call-across-rooms-liz-harris/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Vogue</i></a>.)</p>
<p>Not everything is so explicit. In ""Clearing"", she keeps her vocal range between the notes of her piano chords, as though she were seeking refuge there, and her wispy voice frequently dissolves into indecipherability, like cold breath passing through a beam of sunlight. Her phrasing is tentative and guarded; even without recourse to her trusty loops, she finds ways to muddy the atmosphere. Multitracking offers a way of hiding behind her own shadow, and her foot rarely leaves the piano's sustain pedal, even on the instrumental numbers.</p>
<p>Only two songs on the album don't quite fit the mold. The opening ""Made of Metal"", essentially a means of clearing the air, is just a slow, ritualistic drumbeat wreathed in the sound of distant frogs. And the closing ""Made of Air"" returns us to the drifting ambient world of Grouper that we're most familiar with. The latter dates back to 2004, and it's of a piece with other material from that period, like her 2005 album <i>Way Their Crept</i>, where looping tones of uncertain provenance—Voice? Guitar? Keyboard?—swirled into a jellied haze. It doesn't necessarily fit with what's come before it, but it's a welcome addendum to the album, if only for its familiarity.</p>
<p><i>Ruins</i> has a vivid sense of place. Harris recorded the album in 2011 during an artistic residency in Aljezur, Portugal—a tiny coastal town tucked inside a nature preserve on the southwestern corner of the country. In a press release, she describes the pleasures of recording simply, hiking to the beach, and getting lost in her head, working out ""a lot of political anger and emotional garbage… The album is a document. A nod to that daily walk. Failed structures. Living in the remains of love."" Even without knowing the particulars of the album's backstory, the naked recording means that you can practically picture the room in which it was made—the worn floorboards, or maybe ceramic tiles, dusted with sand; the stucco walls, slightly damp; the steam rising from a cup of tea near the upright piano. Even the microwave that made the tea, which beeps once towards the end of ""Labyrinth"", an accidental noise allowed to remain in the final cut. From the hushed mood and half-enunciated vocals of it all, you get the feeling she didn't speak to many people during that time of focused creativity. Lucky for us.</p></div>"|19820.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19820-grouper-ruins/|8.8|Philip Sherburne

In 1960, he was leaving Miles Davis’ group after a stint during which it was widely understood to be among the greatest jazz units of all time. In 1967, he was at the leading edge of free jazz, creating abstract and unbelievably intense music that left the mainstream far behind. In between he recorded impossibly dense music with a big band (<i>Ascension</i>), ballads and standards albums with Duke Ellington and Johnny Hartman, extended suites (<i>A Love Supreme</i> and <i>Meditations</i>), and had generally pushed jazz as far as it could go. And then, in July 1967, he was gone.</p>
<p>During his brilliant run between 1964 and 1967, Albert Ayler, a fellow tenor saxophonist whom Coltrane admired tremendously, seemed like he’d finally found the music he was meant to make. Coltrane was always searching. His music was never content with where it was but was always looking toward what it might be. This would be less interesting if not for the fact that this search is embodied in the sound itself. There’s always something left hanging in Coltrane’s later work—when it ends you feel not just everything that happened but also what might have happened but didn’t. And you sense that he felt same way. He famously told Miles Davis that he played so long because he didn’t know how to end his solos, and Miles famously told him back, “Take the horn out of your mouth.”</p>
<p>Eight months before he died, Coltrane played a gig at Temple University. It was recorded by the radio station but has only been heard in partial, poor-quality bootlegs until this year, when it was polished up and issued for this set. The music on <i>Offering</i> shifts between standard ideas of jazz and noise music, regularly tipping over from chords and melody and harmony into the realm of pure sound. So I tend to experience music like this as a visceral thing, something to be played loudly that can be both beautiful and frightening.</p>
<p>The last two years of Coltrane’s life found him experimenting relentlessly, perhaps aware, on some level, that he only had so much time to get it all in. He used extra bassists, extra drummers, new kinds of percussionists, expanded ensembles. On this night in Philadelphia, he had some of all these things: a couple of extra saxophone players he knew from the area as well as Umar Ali, Algie DeWitt, and Robert Kenyatta on percussion. I’m obligated to point them out because they are in the credits and they were an important part of this gig as the people in the room experienced it. But the truth is, this recording, all done through one microphone without much thought for posterity, misses a great deal of sound from those extra drummers and percussionists and, indeed, from the pianist, Alice Coltrane, as well as the bassist, Sonny Johnson. This set puts the focus squarely on the leader, who was nearest the microphone, and his playing—and vocalizing—made this a special night indeed.</p>
<p>In 1966, electric jazz was just around the corner; the music would later get denser and more intense, it would mix with rock or go way over into the realm of abstraction. Coltrane himself seemed to be returning from the edge of chaos. <i>Live in Japan</i>, recorded in July 1966 but not released in full until 1991, was about as far “out” as he got, stretching tunes that once lasted for eight or nine minutes to nearly 60, and filling them with explosive atonal blowing. But by the time this set was recorded, he was returning to Earth as if after an armageddon, seeing what was left. He starts here with “Naima”, a pretty tune written in 1959 that later became a standard. The harmonic structure is difficult to puzzle out, but Coltrane plays with force and clarity, in a melodic mode even as the tune differs from the familiar lines. It does, however, have Alice Coltrane’s longest solo, an intense banging thing that reveals the nature of her genius. (She could be a superb soloist on two instruments as a leader, but her distinctive voice never quite emerged in her husband’s band.) You have to use some imagination to hear the song inside of it.</p>
<p>“Crescent” is almost unbearably intense, the brittle shrieking egged on by someone yelling “Hey!” in the background. Melody and harmony are sacrificed at the altar of texture and feeling, anger and joy bleed into sadness. Once in a while you can hear a cowbell in the background, and you get a glimpse of what it might have been like to be here on this night. “Leo”, one studio version of which was found on the Coltrane/Rashied Ali duo album <i>Interstellar Space</i>, was another staple of Coltrane’s sets during this period, and its hyper-bouncing opening theme sets the stage for a long and intense blowing session. This is Ali’s turn to solo, and he does so beautifully, the articulation of every hit coalescing into a blur of feeling, his drums showing greater clarity when other instruments drop out.</p>
<p>During the following track, “Leo”, something unusual happens, a moment that has been mentioned extensively in the marketing of this release: Coltrane sets aside his horn, and starts to vocalize, singing phrases while beating on his chest to give his vocals an effect something like vibrato. The first thing that comes to mind with this gesture is that perhaps Coltrane had reached a point where his instrument couldn’t convey the feelings he had locked inside; it spilled out beyond the realm of technique, and there should be no object between the expression and the reception. This is what I think of when considering <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wO9UCV5APPA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a piece of music recorded eight months later</a>, by Albert Ayler, at John Coltrane’s funeral, when he gives over the last few minutes of his performance to ecstatic and tortured screams. But Coltrane was never quite as unhinged as Ayler, he always tempered emotion with his intellect, and his music, even at its wooliest, always had a sense of control. So Coltrane’s vocals are best heard as an extension in texture, a musical expression as opposed to just an emotional one. And they do add much here—every time his voice comes in, it’s disarming.</p>
<p>By the time the record gets to the iconic “My Favorite Things”, we’re reminded that Coltrane was doing some strange things with the tune by this point, most notably starting it with a bass solo that lasted several minutes. You’re in a certain headspace as a music listener when you’re sitting through bass solos that go on for that long, but when the tune finally kicks in, it’s still fascinating to follow where Coltrane was taking this song. At points, his soprano saxophone trills away on repetitions that suggest Steve Reich-like minimalism, elsewhere the music leans toward noisy drone. “My Favorite Things” was a center of gravity that Coltrane would move around, sometimes examining it from a distance, taking in the beauty of the whole, and sometimes veering so close to it he threatened to burn up. And while I wouldn’t put this version in the top 10 of ones I’ve heard, it’ll never get old for me.</p>
<p>Considering his stature in American music, every note of John Coltrane’s music deserves release. That’s a given. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that every note has something for the broader music listening public. <i>Offering </i>passes that test, it’s both an “important” jazz release and one that’s actually enjoyable to listen to.</p></div>"|19522.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19522-offering-live-at-temple-university/|8.5|Mark Richardson

Then he brought out Medicine’s leader Brad Laner to sing with him on M83’s “Splendor”—which makes sense, seeing as how Laner guests on the 2011 studio version of the song. The gesture was a small one in the grand scheme of things—it’s a safe bet few in the audience recognized the name—but it’s also indicative of Medicine’s less than enviable position over the years: a band loved, respected, and imitated by musicians, but minimally acknowledged beyond that. Like many groups in existence during the alt-rock free-for-all of the '90s, Medicine had its shot at fame; signed to Rick Rubin’s American Recordings, they appeared on the chart-topping soundtrack for <i>The Crow</i> (and in the movie itself, along with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau Twins</a>’ Elizabeth Fraser). When that lottery ticket didn’t pan out, the band broke up in the '90s, then reformed for their 2013 comeback album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18320-medicine-to-the-happy-few/""><i>To The Happy Few</i></a>. But where <i>To The Happy Few</i> feasted on Medicine’s legacy with a desperate yet stately elation, the band’s new full-length, <i>Home Everywhere</i>, just sounds desperate.</p>
<p><i>Home Everywhere </i>is a mess. It isn’t always a <i>bad</i> mess, but far too often, it is. Where<i> To The Happy Few </i>exercised impeccable taste and restraint in its attempt to probe every overblown trope of shoegaze and space-pop, <i>Home Everywhere</i> piles them on. And on and on and on. The panning from left to right is juddering, spasmodic, panicky. Worse, it works against the melodic euphoria Laner excels at; a little deconstruction goes a long way, and Laner’s lost the plot. Songs like “The Reclaimed Girl” and “Move Along – Down The Road” aren’t psychedelic, as that would imply at least the possibility of bliss. Instead, Laner pumps so many samples, filters, noisemakers, and modulators into the mix, the band’s own instrumental source material is treated like something that should be anxiously covered up.</p>
<p>Of course, it shouldn’t; there are great tunes poking out of the tangle, or at least great fragments of tunes. Too many of them in rapid succession, actually, or all at once. Laner’s longtime cohort Elizabeth Thompson twines her ethereal voice wonderfully around his on “Don’t Be Slow”; still, it’s not enough of a lifeline to cling to as the music boils and manically pans around them. Making music that sounds like an orchestra of malfunctioning transistor radios at once is a noble pursuit, and one that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a> consummated triumphantly; MBV have always been one of Medicine’s biggest inspirations, and that hasn’t changed on <i>Home Everywhere</i>. But where MBV—and Medicine, at their best—nervily harness those smears and blurs, “Turning” renders that lovely paradox of abrasive dreaminess into stabs of spectroscopic strobe lights, garbage-disposal bass, and self-sampling to the point of bleary-eyed myopia. It doesn’t come off as experimental, any more than it would to dump every chemical on the lab floor to see what happens.</p>
<p>When <i>Home Everywhere</i> takes a deep breath, though, it’s incredible. “Cold Life” is spacious, dynamic, and eerily backmasked, or at least backmasking is the aural illusion that Laner is trying and winning at evoking. It’s a gentle queasiness, and it’s made all the more absorbing by Laner’s flowing, melancholy vocals, even though he sounds like he’s brazenly mimicking <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith/"">Elliott Smith</a> for some reason. Similarly, “They Will Not Die” and “It’s All About You” reign in the album’s sensory overload, daubing it sparingly from time to time for maximum impact. At over 11 minutes, the album’s cosmic-jam title track doesn’t justify its sprawl; it’s over about halfway through, but someone forget to tell the band that. At this point in Medicine’s existence, they’ve earned the right to get as excessive as they want—and in a way, it’s thrilling to see a group that’s been around so long continue to go for broke with rapturous self-indulgence. <i>Home Everywhere</i> has every element needed to make a great Medicine album, only they’re deployed in gangling spasms and obsessive over-processing. If only they’d edited themselves a little more—or a little less.</p></div>"|19869.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19869-medicine-home-everywhere/|6.0|Jason Heller

She has toured as a member of noise-rock outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2158-jackie-o-motherfucker/"">Jackie-O Motherfucker</a> and alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6392-nautical-almanac/"">Nautical Almanac</a>, although most listeners will recognize her robustly forlorn voice from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"">Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16936-mature-themes/"">Mature Themes</a></i>. After the release of her 2011 label debut, <i>The Outside Room</i>, she has wandered America like a Steinbeck character (anyone who adapts her stage name from a Flannery O’Connor novel will certainly be familiar with literary references). Mering tapped maple trees for syrup in rural Kentucky and studied herbs in the New Mexico desert. After a brief layover in Baltimore, she settled into the New York music scene and signed with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=mexican+summer"">Mexican Summer</a>.</p>
<p>All of those experiences—from harsh drone to hallucinogenic herbology—come to play on her second album, <i>The Innocents</i> (which is presumably a reference to the 1961 film adaptation of Henry James’ ""The Turn of the Screw""<i>). </i>The album plays like a picaresque of the Lower 48, as Mering collects sounds and ideas along her journey and pieces them together into an album that has considerable scope yet is rooted in the personal.<i> </i>Drawing from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1131-donovan/"">Donovan</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17325-joan-baez/"">Joan Baez</a> as well as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17325-joan-baez/"">Mark Linkous</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a>, Mering blends the idylls of folk ballads and madrigals with the sonic abrasiveness of noise rock. Most of the songs feature just guitar and Mering’s rich soprano, but on several tracks she manipulates the instruments to suggest music that is curdling, fading, transforming, evolving right before our ears. Even the simplest and loveliest tunes, such as “Requiem for Forgiveness” or closer “Bound to Earth”, sound like they might be interrupted at any moment by waves of distortion.</p>
<p>To indulge another literary reference, <a href=""http://www.potw.org/archive/potw351.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the center will not hold</a>. Things fall apart. There is no solid ground on <i>The Innocents</i>. The album opens with explosions in the distance, a rhythm of destruction that portends something darkly ominous. Borrowing not just the music but also the topicality of '60s folk, “Land of Broken Dreams” conveys a sense of immense dread as Mering sings about an America in fantastical disrepair—in particular, the growing rift between what the country should be and what it actually is. “Stand by to believe in the land of the free, whatever you want it to be,” she sings, and it’s impossible to determine just how much irony is packed into that line. Are those explosions an echo of atomic testing in the 1950s, or perhaps of the bombs planted by radical activists in the 1970s?</p>
<p>The aftershocks of those opening explosions reverberate throughout the album. “Bad Magic” sets its delicate acoustic guitar theme against an ambient tape hiss, as though Mering were self-consciously creating a new field recording. “Some Winters” opens with a warped piano, its glissandos garbled and mutating, as though Mering found the tapes buried deep in the snow—memories of an old affair made new. “I’m as broken as a woman can be,” she sings, with a peculiar quiver in her voice. That vibrato, it becomes clear, is not part of the performance itself, but a subtle distortion of the notes in the studio. It’s applied so sparingly that it’s impossible to determine where her voice ends and the manipulation takes over, and the effect is thematically powerful and musically jarring. There’s no small thrill in hearing Mering both uphold and upend the conventions and even the pieties of folk music, which means that while <i>The Innocents</i> may be her second album, it plays like a debut. These finely wrought songs introduce a fascinating and confidently subversive artist and offers a glimpse of the road she’s traveling.</p></div>"|19792.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19792-weyes-blood-the-innocents/|7.7|Stephen M.

It’s easy to see where the confusion would arise: while the group has roots in Chicago noise rock, last year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18644-oozing-wound-retrash/"">Retrash</a></i> owed as much to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23607-voivod/"">Voivod</a>’s sci-fi weirdness as it did to crossover’s streetwise attitude. Oozing Wound weren’t trying to infiltrate a scene, they just happened to make an inventive record most thrash revivalists couldn’t. A year after <i>Retrash</i> they return with their second record, <i>Earth Suck</i>.</p>
<p>Absurd humor has always been a part of Oozing Wound’s music, and while that’s mostly manifested itself in the lyrics, it extends itself into the actual riffs on <i>Suck</i>. Opener “Going Through the Motions Til I Die” leads off with a stonery passage that could be from a Red Fang song, but just when you think they’re about to stroke their beards sensually and talk about how they’re “really into metal like the Sword,” they bring the most unchill hate.</p>
<p>A stranger iteration of this comes on “Genuine Creeper”, a homage and pisstake on black metal. The band’s gleeful warpath wouldn’t be appropriate for a BM song, but those riffs are nothing but necro. And if a song about coveting a neighbor’s property isn’t blasphemous, then what is? (If “Creeper” were on a lo-fi cassette, collectors would be tripping over themselves to get what few copies existed.)</p>
<p>Things take a turn for the doomier with “Hippie Speedball”, which sounds like them joking around with fellow Chicagoans Bongripper, thinking “oh yeah, this slow and low thing is for chumps.” This, like most of <i>Suck</i>, shows the strength of letting Chicago’s wide range of metal and punk influence penetrate their sound and loosening things up. Even so, <i>Suck</i> is more focused than <i>Retrash</i>, most evident in better sequencing that balances the longer and shorter songs.</p>
<p>Lyrically, <i>Suck</i> is obsessed with selfishness and its consequences. The first line, after all, is “I’ve lost the will to live an honest life.” While these themes appeared on <i>Retrash</i>, they were competing with heavily baked sci-fi pulp odysseys. Here, Oozing Wound have largely dropped the sci-fi lyrics, but not their rage. “Bury Me With My Money” leaves you with no pity for the toy-hoarding, money-crazed lunatic vocalist Zack Weil conjures. It’s also the thrashiest number on the album, with no use for subtlety. “Speedball” could be considered the aftermath of <i>Retrash</i>’s “Call Your Guy”, where the promise of drugs as mind-expanding gives way to the harrowing realities of addiction. This is not the lust of power of “Money”, but simply the crippling need to be “a thief in a palace of waifs” in order to survive.</p>
<p>It all takes its toll on closer “False Peak (Earth Suck)”, giving words to the album’s cover, a multi-fisted assault on our worthless egg of a world. Oozing Wound have matured without losing sight of the frayed ends that make their music interesting. That growth is especially impressive given the length of time between <i>Suck</i> and its predecessor. The band didn’t need to be a part of a dying, irrelevant movement; they’ve got what it takes to make one for themselves.</p></div>"|19872.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19872-oozing-wound-earth-suck/|7.7|Andy O'Connor

And so we got J. Mascis <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8z8Sk2to1U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">moaning his way through Peter Frampton’s “Show Me the Way”</a>, the Minutemen <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pFRP5hQVoc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">chopping Van Halen songs in half</a>, Pussy Galore <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHAEkWcgBD8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">licking the burnt spoons littered throughout the Rolling Stones’ <i>Exile on Main Street</i></a>, Sonic Youth <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKBtVe-krtM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">swiping the title of CCR’s “Bad Moon Rising” for their Reagan-era state-of-the-union address</a>, and the Butthole Surfers grinding <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYGoougMHSQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black Sabbath’s “Sweet Leaf” into skunk weed</a>. In this context, what made the early, garage-punk iteration of the Flaming Lips so strange was not their <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-T9SbUfCB7A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sordid subject matter</a>, <a href=""http://www.weirdenergy.com/cdlist/img/album383.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">disturbing cover art</a>, or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBM7f2rveLU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">23-minute acid-rock jams</a>. It was their contrarian reverence for tradition, with the band dropping straight-faced covers of Led Zeppelin’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZqyRJwWs7Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thank You</a>” and Louis Armstrong’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHg_rpUz1Ko"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">What a Wonderful World</a>” into their repertoire for no other reason than they loved the songs.</p>
<p>As the Lips scored sudden mainstream success in the early '90s with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvfxKbpoxRE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a fluke MTV hit</a>, their cover choices turned decidedly more esoteric, as the band used their modicum of celebrity to shine a light on known artists’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSEgf8frI_A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lesser-known work</a>, reclaim <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Age_Love_Song"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">new-wave novelties</a>, or to promote <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen_One_(Smog_song)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">then-unheralded underground peers</a>. But in the post-<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/27-pitchfork-classic/724-the-flaming-lips-the-soft-bulletin/"">Soft Bulletin</a></i> era—during which the Lips’ music became both more tonally serious and relentlessly experimental—cover songs have become a necessary salve through which the band can reassert their playful side and maintain the circus-like atmosphere at their concerts even when touring behind decidedly more downcast material.</p>
<p>And ever since they trotted out old warhorses like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iUwz16A6oI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>” and “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY13dE3bqm8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">War Pigs</a>” on their 2006 <i>At War With the Mystics</i> tour, the Lips have seemingly been on a mission to modernize the entire classic-rock canon, by curating full-album, collaboration-heavy reconstructions of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtliIqF2HNY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pink Floyd</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtliIqF2HNY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">King Crimson</a> milestones (with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBMkF_Rssr4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Stone Roses debut-album redux</a> thrown in to show they’re still fond of music made after 1980). But while such recurring retro-gazing exercises may seem antithetical to the adventurous, boundary-pushing ethos the Lips displayed on 2009’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13522-embryonic/"">Embryonic</a></i> and last year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17804-the-flaming-lips-the-terror/"">The Terror</a></i>, the mere task of making the most totemic (and, by extension, contemptuously overplayed) rock songs of all time seem fresh presents its own formidable challenge, one they’ve answered by gradually shifting their cover-song approach from faithfully sacred to kill-yer-idols profane. Now comes the greatest challenge of all: tackling the Beatles’ Summer-of-Love soundtrack <i>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,</i> a generation-defining achievement so masterful that its very title has become the <a href=""http://de.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Sgt.%20Pepper"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">official shorthand descriptor</a> for masterful achievements.</p>
<p>The Lips aren’t the first to give <i>Pepper</i> a shake, but even the post-punk/new pop makeover the album received on the 1988 NME-curated comp <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sgt._Pepper_Knew_My_Father"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sgt. Pepper Knew My Father</a></i>—complete with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SaC9htnMBGE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mark E. Smith warbling “A Day in the Life”</a>—feels overly staid and deferential compared to what transpires here. And even by the standards of the Lips’ previous tribute-album overhauls, <i>With a Little From My Fwends</i> is a colossal, chaotic undertaking, its 27-collaborator guest list bringing together pop singers (Miley Cyrus, Tegan &amp; Sara), fellow alt-rock veterans (J. Mascis, Tool’s Maynard James Keenan), Bonnaroo royalty (My Morning Jacket, Dr. Dog), indie phenoms (Foxygen, Phantogram), and maverick MCs (Cool Kid Chuck Inglish), alongside the usual army of Lips affiliates like New Fumes and Stardeath &amp; White Dwarfs. And where previous experiments were limited to Record Store Day releases or iTunes exclusives, this one is a more widely publicized benefit album for <a href=""https://thebellafoundation.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Bella Foundation</a>, an Oklahoma City-based animal shelter that provides crucial veterinary services to low-income pet owners. But while the charitable component lends <i>With a Little From My Fwends </i>a noble purpose beyond just being another Wayne Coyne-commandeered, clown-car-filling amusement, the end result occasionally suggests your time might be better spent revisiting the original album and <a href=""https://thebellafoundation.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">making a direct donation</a>.</p>
<p>One of the great breakthroughs of <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> was how it used the recording studio to create a vivid, three-dimensional sense of space and place, bringing the lyrics to life in audio-storybook form. (Think of the live-concert ambience of the opening title-track “With a Little Help From My Friends” suite, or the carnival-esque clamor of “Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite!”; even the clarinet refrain of “When I’m Sixty Four” gives off the musty scent of a grandparent’s house.) But the Lips and Fwends go to town on these songs with little regard for thematic resonance or big-picture atmosphere. In the spirit of the aforementioned 80s-era indie cover-song desecrations, these aren’t so much revisions as disembowelments that replace the guts of the originals with a tangle of short-circuiting exposed wires. And given that the Lips weren’t even around to supervise all of their guest contributions (Coyne and co. actually only appear on a handful of tracks), things undoubtedly get messy quick, if not downright hazardous. With its scatterbrained, kinder-pop take on the title track (which climaxes with an arrhythmic, atonal guitar solo from J. Mascis), and a strangulated call-and-response between Wilco offshoot the Autumn Defense and Lightning Bolt’s Brian Chippendale (aka Black Pus) on “With a Little Help From My Friends”,<i> </i>the project effectively gives <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIJ4T1mNFQA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shreds treatment</a>.  </p>
<p>Of course, even the most successful cover songs in pop history are inherently blasphemous—in that they suggest unexplored avenues that the original could’ve taken, coax lurking undercurrents to the fore, and cast the source material in an entirely new light. But the problem with a lot of these versions is that they’re unruly on just a surface level. Whether it’s the wobbly-kneed Dr. Dog/Morgan Delt/Chuck Inglish gang-up on “Getting Better”, Maynard James Keenan’s inert, industrialized “Mr. Kite!”, or Def Rain and Pitchwafuzz’s vocoderized, static-swirled “When I’m Sixty Four”, the Lips’ Fwends are so intent on tripping up the songs’ rhythmic momentum and weirding up the basic melodies with hammy vocals that they ultimately reinforce their sturdiness. They’re trashing all the furniture in the house, but not bulldozing any walls to open up new vantages.  </p>
<p>It’s the simple revisions that yield the greatest revelations. The Electric Würms—aka the Lips alter-ego aggregate that promotes Steven Drozd to lead vocalist—recast “Fixing a Hole” as a charmingly low-key psych-folk reverie that amplifies the song’s slow-percolating existential ennui; Stardeath’s stuttering synth-funk take on “Lovely Rita” is given a sly queer spin by guests Tegan and Sara (while their robotic delivery —coupled with the song’s mechanistic motion—craftily adapts the song to a modern world where parking enforcement is largely an automated process). And while Foxygen—with the help of MGMT’s Ben Goldwasser—stretch out the Sgt. Pepper title-track reprise to nearly triple the original’s length (making it even longer than the song it’s supposed to set up, “A Day in the Life”), it’s transformed into precisely the sort of wiggy organ-pumped workout Billy Shears and the boys might have used to close down some imaginary festival set on the Isle of Wight.</p>
<p>Ironically, the seemingly most outrageous aspect of this entire endeavour—i.e., the mere presence of Miley Cyrus—proves to be its grounding force. On an album where everyone is trying way too hard to out-freak one another, Cyrus—much like the Led Zep-loving Lips of the '80s—stands out by simply playing it straight (which feels strange in and of itself). Tellingly, she’s entrusted with the album’s two most celebrated songs, turning in effective duets with Coyne on a splendorous, slow-motion surge through “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds” and a suitably mournful “A Day in the Life”, where she handles an electro-ticked, space-age update of Paul McCartney’s middle eight (and really does sound like she just woke up, fell out of bed, and dragged a comb across her head). Curiously, the relatively reverential reading of the latter song leaves out its most notorious feature—that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Q9D4dcYng&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m19s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dramatic, sustained piano-pounded finale</a>. The omission is both intentionally heretical (how can you end that song any other way?) yet oddly reverential, suggesting that, even if you’re subjecting one of the most revered albums of all time to sadistic sonic surgery, some things are sacred. According to the eternally loopy logic of the Flaming Lips, reinforcing a spiritual connection to your greatest influence means cutting the chord. </p></div>"|19862.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19862-the-flaming-lips-with-a-little-help-from-my-fwends/|5.5|Stuart Berman

Led by Vindsval, the band’s reclusive composer, vocalist, and guitarist (and sometimes sole member), they are the black metal equivalent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>, in that never release the same album twice, but release albums that sound like only they could have made them.</p>
<p>Most bands are lucky to have one distinctive record, or even a derivative album just original enough to merit positive reviews: Blut Aus Nord’s trajectory, from the unforgiving frost of their debut <i>Ultima Thulée </i>(composed by Vindsval in his mid-teens), to the industrial nightmares of <i>The Work Which Transforms God</i> and the <i>777</i> trilogy, is nothing short of astounding. Their newest offering, <i>Memoria Vetusta III – Saturnian Poetry</i>, like the other albums in the <i>Memoria Vetusta</i> series—1996’s <i>Fathers of the Icy Age</i> and 2009’s <i>Dialogue With the Stars</i>—is an exploration into grandiose melodic black metal, and it's not only the strongest entry in that series, but also continual proof that Blut Aus Nord remain unrivaled in this realm.</p>
<p>On the surface, moving in a more recognizable direction may seem like a regression, especially for an artist praised for an unrelenting march towards new territories. But Blut Aus Nord have far from repeated themselves here. As great as Vindsval was on <i>Thulée </i> and the other two <i>Memoria Vetusta</i> records, he’s a much more seasoned musician in 2014. <i>Poetry</i> boasts clearer production than the rest of Blut Aus Nord’s work, which better showcases how much he’s poured into this. He layers his guitars so they become the strongest voices, so much so that it’s not an issue that his growls are a little low in the mix. If pressed to find a standout track, a difficult task with a record of this level, ""Tellus Mater"" showcases his desire to reach the heavens, letting riffs soar high without falling into the overwrought ""symphonic"" trap. Except for an ambient ""Prelude"" and a bridge in ""Forhist"" that recalls <i>Thulée</i>’s more tranquil moments, this record hardly lets you rest.</p>
<p>Blut Aus Nord have always been about transporting listeners into realms they could not fathom themselves, realms that only an idiosyncratic personality like Vindsval could imagine, and <i>Poetry</i> is no exception. Instead of disorienting you with dystopian-future chord patterns and alienation, it overloads you with opulence.  <span>The beauty found here is intoxicating, and you’ll feel a dizzying conqueror’s lust coming out. </span>This is most evident in the use of choral vocals throughout the record; they’re uplifting, and in the haze <i>Poetry</i> cloaks you in, you think they’re deifying you. Even in rapture, Vindsval can make a sharp turn into chaos, which he does by tweaking his guitar playing on the last two songs, ""Metaphor of the Moon"" and ""Clarissima Mundi Lumina"", making his riffs feel more like apocalyptic prophecy. This shift is subtle, and you may not catch it on the first listen, but it gives <i>Poetry</i> a closing trajectory that ties it all together.</p>
<p>Vindsval’s also found fresh blood in new drummer Thorns, who’s played in a variety of other bands including Frostmoon Eclipse, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29924-glorior-belli/"">Glorior Belli</a>, and Deathrow. While he also contributed to <i>Triunity</i>, a split with P.H.O.B.O.S. from earlier this year, this record marks his real entrance into the band, and even with such huge expectations on his shoulders, he delivers a more than capable performance, showing he can meet the demands of even the most bewildering musicians. <i>Poetry</i> wouldn’t have made sense with Vindsval’s electronic drum programming from the <i>777 </i> series—those records were more industrial, whereas this record is more recognizably black metal, and a cold, mechanical drum machine wouldn't work. There needed to be something with some blood behind it here, something more ""natural."" He needed a human touch, even if his music is otherworldly.</p>
<p>It’s also worth nothing that few albums do justice to their cover art as <i>Poetry</i> does. The cover was designed by Kristian ""Necrolord"" Wåhlin, most famous for the majestic sceneries of Dissection’s two classic albums, 1993’s <i>The Somberlain</i> and 1995’s <i>Storm of the Light's Bane</i>, and the exquisite chaos of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1394-emperor"">Emperor</a>’s 1994 landmark <i>In the Nightside Eclipse</i>. Vindsval’s layered compositions compliment the hypnotic and intricate details of Necrolord's work. Great music was made before the ""album experience"" and humanity’s need for music will live long after it, but it’s still always gratifying to see a complete vision like <i>Poetry</i> come to life, especially in a body of work as masterful as Blut Aus Nord’s.</p></div>"|19945.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19945-blut-aus-nord-memoria-vetusta-iii-saturnian-poetry/|8.2|Andy O'Connor

But put them on shuffle and the delineations disappear—they all sound like Black Milk tracks. On <i>If There's a </i><i>Hell Below</i>, for the first time, he consciously takes a sonic mulligan, trading in the same murky Castlevania synth-lines, wrecking-ball drums and dark-night-of-the-soul wails as its predecessor. </p>
<p class=""p1"">So, why does it sound <i>better</i> than that album? Because it's a new Black Milk record, which always sound incrementally closer to some Ideal Black Milk Album that may or may not ever exist. This makes him a difficult artist to love, but an easy one to like. He’s constantly halving the distance to his target, getting closer but not quite getting there. But those infinitesimal improvements on <i>Hell Below</i>—indeed, the very places where it remains static—show, in some ways, what that Ideal Album might look like.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Most importantly, he’s acknowledging where his talents lie. The old line on him is: great producer, shitty rapper. If the dude could quit spitting double-time platitudes about getting faded backstage, the thinking goes, he’d release a great record. On <i>No Poison, No Paradise</i>, though, he dialed back his eagerness on the mic and let the beats breathe. This trend continues on <i>Hell Below</i>, particularly on ""Story and Her"", a sprightly, smooth-jazz Tribe throwback that evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3499-q-tip/"">Q-Tip</a> more than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"">Dilla</a>. Over soft vibes, Black Milk drops sing-song come-ons that tumble organically into a low-key verse. The lyrics are as trite and sanctimonious as can be (think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1096-dizzee-rascal/"">Dizzee Rascal</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrc3OmIRovA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jezebel""</a>), but as the beat morphs, halfway in, to a keening, insistent guitar lick, Milk follows suit, with a wide-open flow painted in blank space. The crooning intro melts into an almost spoken-word outro, with a rhyme scheme that snaps into place as if only to tug the verse onward.</p>
<p class=""p1"">He sounds, in other words, <i>good</i> on the track—a first for the emcee. He repeats the feat on the nearly 3-minute conclusion ""Up &amp; Out"", which is just a drum loop, some scratches, and a delirious, stuttering mic performance. In both instances, he raps in reverence of the beat, letting his glorious drums hit without shouting punchlines over them. Elsewhere, he resolutely does not screw up highlights like the proggy ""All Mighty"", the dense, clattering ""Quarter Water"", or ""What It’s Worth"", which recalls early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, of all people, in its tuneful sense of melancholy. He’s always seemed to want to be Black Thought, but he comes across more like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4400-ti/"">T.I.</a> on the best parts of <i>Hell Below</i>, saying very little but saying it well. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The focus, then, stays on the production, which is, as usual, an absolute feast. He’s grown fond of the mid-track left-field switch-up, sometimes just for a bar or two (""Hell Below"", ""Scum""), and of the short, dusty outro loop (pretty much every track). While this might sound scattered, in practice it’s just the opposite: He’s settled down a bit, flicking between beats with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2885-madlib/"">Madlib</a>’s ease. A lot of his earlier stylistic about-faces were because of an anxiety, a tension between analog and digital production methods, which a recent LP and EP (tellingly called <i>Synth or Soul</i> and <i>Glitches in the Break</i>) seem to have eased. He found the ghost in the machine, and so he’s agitating less over realness—over fidelity to the ""old school"". The music on <i>Hell Below</i> is one big wistful wash of sound, unified, but full of idiosyncrasies. (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/615-bun-b/"">Bun B</a>, for example, raps atop a bed of trilling flutes.)</p>
<p class=""p2"">We often talk about listening to Black Milk rap as the cost of entry for listening to Black Milk produce. That's cold, but valid: his relatively flat collaborative work suggests that he saves his best beats for himself. But perhaps it’s also a mis-framing of the argument, in light of <i>Hell Below</i>’s success. In <span class=""s1"">an interview with Complex</span> last year, he referred to an incongruous blast of free jazz on <i>No Poison, No Paradise</i> as ""a Spike Lee movie … written via a rap song."" A more skillful emcee would recreate Lee’s sense of place and character with words, but Black Milk needs the music to do the talking. On <i>If There’s a Hell Below</i>, he lets it.</p></div>"|19822.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19822-black-milk-if-theres-a-hell-below/|7.3|Clayton Purdom

The Swedish polyglot who works as Elliphant released a solid, energetic pop-rap <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17695-elliphant-ep/"">debut EP</a> last January only to follow it up with <i>A Good Idea</i>, a garish, Sweden-exclusive LP that ran the gamut from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork"">Björk</a>-indebted industrial dance to pedestrian sample-based synth pop. She then went on to work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1224-diplo/"">Diplo</a> and co. at <a href=""http://maddecent.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mad Decent</a> for this year’s <i>Look Like You Love It</i>, an EP comprised of dubstep, dancehall, and punk-rap with assists from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"">Skrillex</a>. Still, that frantic, mixed-bag approach, like <i>A Good Idea</i> before it, lacked the unabashed vitality that the first Elliphant EP brought to the table. Olovsdotter has cited <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6501-no-doubt/"">No Doubt</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"">Portishead</a> as early influences, but her output thus far seems more informed by the former’s cultural pastiche rather than the latter's willful eclecticism.</p>
<p><i>One More</i>, Olovsdotter’s latest release on Dr. Luke’s Kemosabe Records, seems intended to temper the unfocused <i>Look Like You Love It</i>. The production across these five tracks, while still filled with its share of glitchy electronic drops, is more subdued than anything Olovsdotter’s done before. Here, she seems more at ease settling into 4 a.m. cabs home at the end of the night rather than indulging in the bacchanalian club life her Mad Decent entry suggested. </p>
<p>That half-sedate, half-totally-wired vibe is best realized on the EP’s title track. With <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31696-lorde/"">Lorde</a> collaborator Joel Little handling production, ""One More"" teems with sparse, undulating synths as Olovsdotter trades verses with Danish pop upstart <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30799-m/"">MØ</a> about 24-hour taco spots and playing hooky from work. The call-and-response finale of ""One More"" switches the track from a modest, pulsing lead single to a near-perfect anthem for getting faced with your best friend. Closer ""You’re Gone"" is of a piece with the title track, taking similarly understated production and hoisting it up with a thumping boost of a chorus, providing quality bookends to <i>One More</i> that suggest more of the EP than it's willing to dole out.</p>
<p>The EP's middle section has the same flaws that crippled <i>A Good Idea</i> and <i>Look Like You Love It</i>, namely lazy songwriting (""Never Been in Love"") and tired stabs at singalong melodies (the Doja Cat-assisted, <i>FIFA 15</i>-soundtracking ""Purple Light""). Even ""Save the Grey"", which shares its name with Olovsdotter’s conceptual activism project aiming to ""save the grey animals like elephants, rhinos, whales, sharks, and wolves,"" tries for a sense of urgency and fails. Perhaps by the time Elliphant releases a debut LP stateside, she’ll have found a more winning balance between the high energy of her party-starting anthems and the more introspective, hangover-friendly deep cuts.</p></div>"|19964.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19964-elliphant-one-more-ep/|5.5|Eric Torres

It wasn’t a political assassination. His wife pulled the trigger. This event is utterly unrelated to <i>Slow Dawns for Lost Conclusions</i>, the second album by the dreamy, chamber-pop ensemble Bell Gardens. The group, which was cofounded by L.A.’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2976-brian-mcbride/"">Brian McBride</a> (Stars of the Lid), chose their name years ago; their debut EP <i>Hangups Need Company</i> came out in 2010, and their first album <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UM7rzux7tSo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Full Sundown Assembly</i></a> came out in 2012. But McBride has worked in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14791-the-effective-disconnect-music-composed-for-the-documentary-vanishing-of-the-bees/"">soundtracks</a> before, and fate has decreed that <i>Slow Dawns for Lost Conclusions </i>can be viewed, in an unhappily accidental way, as the coincidental music to a tragedy.</p>
<p>If the album wasn’t so magisterially moody, it would be easier to ignore the parallel. But from the ghostlike balladry of “Darker Side of Sunshine” to the windswept strumming of “Take Us Away”, McBride and Bell Garden’s other core member Kenneth James Gibson (formerly of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ5hbSb7NOg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Furry Things</a> and now [a]pendics.shuffle, dubLoner, and Eight Frozen Modules, among others) create cinematic, big-vista threnodies dusted with tumbleweed Americana. The abstract, conceptual wavecraft of Stars of the Lid is only an apparition on the horizon; Gibson’s ambient treatments are dyed sepia and dissolved into the album’s threadbare fabric. Gibson has never sounded more like a conventional singer-songwriter, and his singing has improved vastly since <i>Full Sundown Assembly</i>. Not long ago, he strained to hit the notes and tones he seemed to be groping for; on <i>Slow Dawns</i> standouts like “Silent Prayer” and “She Does”, he navigates reverbed electric piano and tranquilized tambourine shakes with the easiest, breathiest grace.</p>
<p>Bell Gardens has fleshed itself out since <i>Full Sundown Assembly</i>, and that expanded ensemble has led to a richer stratifying of strings, pedal steel, synth, and trumpet (some of which is supplied by guests Lauren Chipman of the Rentals and Stewart Cole of Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros). It all forms a smothering, gray-brown haze, yet each element remains discreet and distinct, from the crisp acoustic chords of the instrumental “Joan’s Ambulance” to the chem-trail synths of “Take Us Away”. The brief, voiceless interlude “Avere” comes closest to scratching the group’s classical itch, but even its funereal, chamber-ready study in piano and violin sounds as if it’s being played under a Mojave palm.</p>
<p>Eerily, the late Mayor Crespo’s <a href=""http://www.bellgardens.org/government/citycouncil/mayordanielcrespo.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">profile page</a> on the City of Bell Gardens’ website has not been updated to reflect his death. It says he can still be reached at his city email address; it also states with tragic irony that “in 1986, Mayor Crespo, a young teenager, married his high school sweetheart and has been married ever since.” Synchronicity can play a huge part in the way music is conceived, executed, released, and heard. <i>Slow Dawns for Lost Conclusions</i> is no work of prophecy, but it may be a more diffuse kind of premonition, one that taps into some larger West Coast darkness.</p>
<p>“Darker Side of Sunshine”, “Joan’s Ambulance”, “She’s Stuck in the Endless Loop of Her Decline”, “Trust Lost Trust”, “Take Us Away”: These song titles reflect the album’s slow, sad flow of destiny and escape. A cover of Kris Kristofferson’s “Why Me” (billed here as “Why Me Lord”) is included as a digital-only bonus track; its hushed, hymnal plea for release—“Jesus, my soul’s in your hand,” Gibson sings over a shivering ablution of strings—would be gently devastating in any context. But especially this one. <i>Slow Dawns for Lost Conclusions </i>didn’t need an extra layer of portent and atmosphere hanging over its release. But it’s been given that layer anyway, and it only makes the songs feel that much more delicately heavy.</p></div>"|19764.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19764-bell-gardens-slow-dawns-for-lost-conclusions/|7.4|Jason Heller

I am wont to believe Carrie Brownstein when the Sleater-Kinney guitarist, then 21, qualified <a href=""http://meowonline.org/sleater-kinney-riot-grrrl-grows-up/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this 1996 assertion</a> by shrugging it off as a joke. She was, in all likelihood, alluding to the mainstream-affixed mantra of Seattle's blown-up grunge scene, which her own band's roots in the nearby punk-feminist community of Olympia opposed. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/349-bikini-kill/"">Bikini Kill</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"">Fugazi</a> before them, Sleater-Kinney would never succumb to the beckoning of major labels. And in 1996, with their crass punk insurrectionism, the idea of mass success was laughable. Of course, Brownstein's reputation for regional parody on <a href=""http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Portlandia""</a> now precedes her. ""We're never going to be huge like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3272-pearl-jam/"">Pearl Jam</a> or something,"" she said in that interview, ""but I want more people to have access to our music, not just the geeky kids."" Seven years later, in 2003, during the beginnings of the Iraq War, Sleater-Kinney played its <a href=""http://electrip.com/sleater-kinney/1html/showsH/2003shows.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first of many</a> arena-sized gigs—on tour with Pearl Jam.</p>
<p>From 1994 to 2006, Sleater-Kinney seemed to have it all. The trio of Brownstein, singer-guitarist Corin Tucker, and (from '96 on) drummer Janet Weiss created and then fervently revised one of the most distinctive sounds in rock: The friction of their overlapping voices—Brownstein's monotone speak-sing anchoring Tucker's wild vibrato—had an ecstatic, unusual beauty. The expressive longing of Tucker's alone was a gift, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6422-kathleen-hanna/"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hanna</a>'s hardcore holler aspiring to the quasi-operatics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2144-iron-maiden"">Iron Maiden</a>'s Bruce Dickinson. Tucker is perhaps the first punk singer to attempt such a thing while worshipping the enormity of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6279-aretha-franklin/"" target=""_blank"">Aretha Franklin</a>, channeling lessons from the Queen of Soul into her own singing, holding onto moments for dear life and then projecting them to the heavens, becoming <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTHpfZhfQbk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Queen of Rock</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, Sleater-Kinney were humble, imageless indie-rockers; in song, they demanded icon status. This streamlined set, <i>Start Together</i>, captures that dichotomy, archiving the Sleater-Kinney canon with care: from the ideological-punches of thirdwave feminism to their post-riot grrrl classic rock revisionism, all seven albums have been remastered and paired with a plainly gorgeous hardcover photobook, as well as the surprise of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17172-sleater-kinney-bury-our-friends/"" target=""_blank"">reunion-launching 7"" single</a>. In all, <i>Start Together</i> tells the unlikely story of how this band carried the wildfire of '90s Oly-punk to pastures of more ambitious musicality—a decade that moves from caterwauling shrieks to glowing lyricism, from barebones snark to Zep-length improv, from personal-political to outright (left) political.</p>
<p>Sleater-Kinney was consciously <i>about</i> rock'n'roll. Lou Reed sang for Jenny whose life was saved by rock; Ramones told us how Sheena became a punk. In 1994 there was no shortage of women plugging in—newly born classics included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6162-hole/"">Hole</a>'s <i>Live Through This</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair/"">Liz Phair</a>'s <i>Exile in Guyville</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"">PJ Harvey</a>'s <i>Rid of Me</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"">the Breeders</a>' <i>Last Splash—</i>but the lineage of larger-than-life stars, the deified behind-the-head-shredders, still had few instances of women delivering rock-as-saviour meta-narratives themselves. Sleater-Kinney turned the machismo of hippie-blooded '60s and '70s rock on its head: covers of Springsteen and CCR, homages to Kinks and the Clash, Brownstein's Pete Townshend windmills and shin-kicking swagger, Tucker's defiant declaration that ""I make rock'n'roll!"" A life-or-death seriousness is omnipresent with Sleater-Kinney, but they never rejected rock's base desires—sex, dancing, proverbial milkshakes—although sometimes they vaguely mocked them. Sleater-Kinney stole from men what men had in turn stolen from the margins: electrified blues that all still made girls scream.</p>
<p>The first Sleater-Kinney practice was in March of 1994. It was the spring that Kurt Cobain died. Hindsight paints it clear: Cobain's desire for a future-rock made by women dispersed into the universe. Brownstein and Tucker did Sleater-Kinney as a side-project to their respective bands, the queercore power-chord screams of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1FX46vIY88"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Excuse 17</a> and soul-baring punk of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v_bw-8adTU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heavens to Betsy</a>. Sleater-Kinney fused these politicized sounds, but as they grew—with affection for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/264-the-b-52s/"">B-52's</a> shimmy and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> cool—they never let the punk rulebook limit their vision. Riot grrrl was fragmenting and they learned from its successes and failures—a radical streak pervaded their writerly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8693-husker-du/"">Hüsker Dü</a>-type storytelling—but they also fought to not be removed from the context of their foundation. The wiry blast of 1995's <b><i>Sleater-Kinney</i></b> is as good an indicator of Bikini Kill's influence as any feminist album since, echoing their sound as well as an interest in making punk become activism.</p>
<p>The debut is foremost a rejection of heteronormative sex, as Tucker and Brownstein were reckoning with life inside their bodies as women who approached sexuality fluidly. There's a song about how much sucking dick sucks, called ""How to Play Dead""—it began Sleater-Kinney's mission of showing how society can silence women and minimize their problems. The urgency is real; all of <i>Sleater-Kinney</i> was scrappily-recorded in one night, on a trip to Australia, where they enlisted drummer Lora MacFarlane, who also kept-time on 1996's <i>Call the Doctor</i>. ""A Real Man"" is like an incendiary take on classic feminist text <i>The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm</i>: ""Don't you wanna feel it inside/ They say that it feels so nice,"" Tucker gasps with visceral sarcasm. Call it clit-rock, I guess; over hard-style riffs, Tucker makes it clear she won't wait ""to cum every time."" Amid this whirlwind of pleasure and pain, which occasionally veers towards emo, Brownstein and Tucker's whispers erupt on ""The Day I Went Away"", one of two wistful songs that foreshadow Sleater-Kinney's impending greatness.</p>
<p>Sleater-Kinney continued feeding its appetite for destruction of archetypes on 1996's <b><i>Call the Doctor</i></b>. It improved their raw punk convictions in every way: more complex guitarwork, more distortion to intellectualize, more aggression and profound sadness. ""Why do good things never wanna stay?"" Tucker asks on ""Good Things"", an earnest stomach-twister of a teardrop tune, while the dire ""Anonymous"" wonders why its female protagonist is voluntarily unspoken. ""I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone"" uses tradition to infiltrate and subvert—the riff could be Ramones pushing Stooges' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIqnXTqg8I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Wanna Be Your Dog""</a> into the red—to cleverly protest the worship of male icons and spur revolution: ""I wanna be your Joey Ramone/ Pictures of me on your bedroom door/ Invite you back after the show/ I'm the queen of rock and roll."" It's a two-and-half-minute rock'n'roll joyride deserving of a gender studies thesis.</p>
<p>Tucker's fierce and vulnerable depictions of unconventional love marked the title track, where the dueling vocals first exploded. ""It felt like something had opened up,"" Brownstein told <a href=""http://owsk.ms11.net/articles/rsarticle.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rolling Stone</i></a>. ""We just stopped. And [Corin] was like, ‘This is so awesome, you have to keep doing that.’ It felt like I had fused with her. This bolt of lightning had gone from my chest to hers."" <i>Call the Doctor</i> landed at number three on <i>The Village Voice</i>’s then-influential critic’s poll. Their label, Chainsaw, couldn’t press copies fast enough.</p>
<p>Then, behold: Janet Weiss. She joined on 1997's breakneck <b><i>Dig Me Out</i></b>, an all-time great American punk statement, giving Sleater-Kinney the most crucial muscle a drummer can offer: not sheer force, but heart, taking the momentum to a new plane. Sleater-Kinney released their next four records with the larger Olympia feminist label, <a href=""http://www.killrockstars.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kill Rock Stars</a>, but none distilled the band's sound and attitude like <i>Dig Me Out</i>: sometimes brutal heartache, sometimes a menacing threat, always intelligent and extreme, there are enough hooks architected into these two- and three-minute songs to span several albums, but even the added dum-de-dum sugar seems as though it must be raw Portland agave.</p>
<p>""Little Babies"" critiques stereotypes of motherhood, ""Heart Factory"" roars over synthetic emotions of the <i>Prozac Nation</i>, and the instantly classic ""Words and Guitar"" is an ode to rock that just feels necessary. At the peak of ""The Drama You've Been Craving""—Tucker's ""Kick it <i>OUT!</i>""—there are practically fireworks bursting on either side. Really, <i>Dig</i> goes from 0-to-100 within seconds of its opening salvo of a title track, which begs for transcendence from worldly oppression, ""Outta this mess/ Outta my head."" Unlike so much in the trajectory of punk, there is no nihilistic self-destruction in the face of chaos. More than skepticism, anti-consumerism, or the glories of tattoo art, punk teaches empathy, a principle Sleater-Kinney practiced with nuance. This is why Sleater-Kinney's music shines a light despite its loudness, why it is easy to be alone with the songs and feel protected. Sleater-Kinney would never forego the optimism to believe their songbook could make us smarter, angrier, more tender and hopeful. <i>Dig Me Out </i>dreams of a better future, clawing itself up with every note.</p>
<p>The highlight of <i>Dig Me Out</i> and Sleater-Kinney's career, ""One More Hour"" is one of the most devastating break-up songs in rock. ""Oh, you've got the darkest eyes,"" Tucker and Brownstein quaver in unison—the song is about their own short-lived romance—and the way Tucker extends the last word, it is like she can't let them go. There are complex feelings near clear ones, which is what break-ups are: someone wants to untangle the mess, someone wants to snip it apart. ""I needed it,"" Tucker howls, hardly distinguishing where one word ends and another begins. ""One More Hour"" is sublime sadness, a kind one can only know when staring at the end of something and wanting desperately for it not to be so. </p>
<p>This feeling would root 1999's atmospheric <b><i>The Hot Rock</i></b>: subdued and spiritual, it served a number of firsts for Sleater-Kinney, among them a slot on the Billboard charts (at 181). Tucker, Brownstein, and Weiss had never sounded so introspective, existential, and dark, so aesthetically poetic and conventionally pretty. The album's interlocking parts were influenced by the gentle alterna-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1737-the-go-betweens/"">Go-Betweens</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a>; voices intertwine gracefully, as if braiding together dreams and wounds. It's the Sleater-Kinney record you're most likely to play on a train while gazing out the window and getting lost in thought.</p>
<p>Brownstein and Tucker sang of personal becoming, the uncertainties of adulthood, dying relationships and technological paranoia—it was, after all, the year before tin-foil Y2K Bugs would signal the end civilization—sometimes with abstract metaphors. The jaw-dropping despair of Brownstein's wearied ballad ""The Size of Our Love"" has a lonely ambience, a love-story plaintively set between hospital walls: ""The ring on my finger/ So tight it turns blue,"" she sings over a crying viola. ""A constant reminder/ I'll die in this room/ If you die in this room."" It's unsurprising that Brownstein has since catapulted her storylines to a mass scale: Comedians are professionals at manipulating our emotions, and if it is one's intention to make people laugh, it must help to have mastered the ability to make them cry.</p>

<p>Swinging back to capital-R Rock, 2000's <b><i>All Hands on the Bad One</i></b> was Sleater-Kinney's most straight-ahead arbiter of thirdwave feminism and also, surprisingly, their most jovial record. Sing-song guitar-pop turned up alongside plainspoken take-downs of sexism in music, and hints of new wave, girl-groups and Go-Gos mixed (cohesively, too) with some of their hardest whiplash-rippers. The enormously hooky ""You're No Rock n' Roll Fun"" taunts dry girl-averse indie snobs: ""You're no rock'n'roll fun/ Like a piece of art that no one can touch!"" the trio sang together, throwing ""whiskey drinks and chocolate bars"" at these guys to shake up the mood, 'cause why not? When Sleater-Kinney note how ""the best man won't hang out with the girl BAA-AAND!"" we're only left wondering why he'd pass on such fun.</p>
<p>Similar humor plays out on ""Milkshake n' Honey"", a <i>Spinal Tap</i>-esque wink at the debauched rocker/groupie complex, but the incisive messages make the best songs: ""The Professional"" uses charged surf-punk to condemn the marginalizing of women in music, ""Male Model"" dismantles the sexist canon and rejects investigations of women's authenticity. A lyrics sheet proves <i>Bad One</i> is Sleater-Kinney's most direct sloganeering, but it doesn't come off as such; Tucker's ferocity and Brownstein's French-sung interjections make it cool, even. ""#1 Must Have"" is the centerpiece, in which Tucker dissects the commodification of riot grrrl and—in light of the rapes at Woodstock in '99—powerfully asserts, ""The number one must-have/ Is that we are safe."" The song's lasting relevance can't be overstated.</p>
<p>The world was irreversibly changed by the time of 2002's <b><i>One Beat</i></b>, Sleater-Kinney's weightiest record. Adventuring with math rock and stomping horns, it was their most explicitly political album, grappling with the aftermath of 9/11 on ""Far Away"" and ""Combat Rock"". These songs reflected the national headspace as selflessly as any act of using someone's tragedy for art allows. Tucker questioned the all-or-nothing patriotism sweeping the U.S., and detailed her own experience that day with raw catharsis, calling-out the hidden President Bush, honoring those who served, and striving for a glimmer of kindness: ""I look to the sky/ And ask it not to rain."" <i>One Beat </i>was not all war songs—the bouncy organ-led love-anthem ""Oh!"" had glammy inflections, ""Prisstina"" chronicled an outcast's discovery of rock. The closer, ""Sympathy"", rips instrumentation from ""Sympathy for the Devil"" but inverts its theme, a prayer for the life of Tucker's premature-born child: ""There is no righteousness in your darkest moment,"" Tucker belts, ""We're all equal in the face of what we're most afraid.""</p>
<p>Even the scope of <i>One Beat</i> couldn't predict Sleater-Kinney's monstrous phase-one farewell, 2005's <b><i>The Woods</i></b><i>. </i>The band's appeal had become that of the indie rock mainstream, and a suburban high-schooler (such as myself, then) could readily learn of <i>The Woods</i>' greatness from the same weirdo dude-friends who repped new CDs by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"">the White Stripes</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a> (like I did). Sleater-Kinney had just played arenas with Pearl Jam, bending notes into heavier, looser sounds, when they journeyed upstate New York to track <i>The Woods</i> with producer David Fridmann, himself only two years removed from helping turn Flaming Lips' 2002 opus <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3081-yoshimi-battles-the-pink-robots/"">Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</a> </i>into a wider breakout.</p>
<p>When your best work is also your most uncompromising and unintelligible, you have accomplished a considerable artistic feat—this was the <i>The Woods</i>. It was tracked live with more distortion than usual, giving it a freneticism, a deranged euphoria. ""[Friddman would] say things to Janet like, 'Play like Keith Moon, but Keith Moon with a blanket coming down over him,'"" Tucker <a href=""http://www.sfbg.com/39/34/cover_music_the_woods.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. That possessed orchestra-of-rhythm translated. The album's heaving 11-minute mega-solo, ""Let's Call It Love"", and the soulful echo ""Night Light"", comprise a grandiose jam colored in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12181-deep-purple/"" target=""_blank"">Deep Purple</a>. Zep riffs abound. ""Entertain"" is an atypical military march, declaring war on hollow retro rock; its ""woah-oh-ohs"" are more like shields than exaltations. ""You come around looking 1984/ You're such a bore, 1984/ Nostalgia, you're using it like a whore""—Brownstein's Orwellian invocation opposes this music with a far more poetic dismissal than ""Fuck Interpol."" Sleater-Kinney's first six records gave a lens through which we might imagine a feminist rewrite of classic rock; <i>The Woods</i> is a front-row seat.</p>
<p>""Jumpers"" was inspired by<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/10/13/jumpers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> a <i>New Yorker</i></a> piece on suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge—""the intensity of feeling that you can't find meaning in your life, so you need to find meaning in your death,"" <a href=""http://www.sfbg.com/39/34/cover_music_the_woods.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brownstein said</a>—which oddly befit the band's decision to end on top. ""Modern Girl"" is Sleater-Kinney's most timeless song, impressionistic as closing one's eyes and staring at the brightest star: ""My whole life was like a picture of a sunny day,"" Brownstein sings, like Sleater-Kinney's ""Yesterday"". But embedded in the soft twinkle is a critique of the consumer culture Sleater-Kinney resisted. (They despised the new proposition of a career-shifting iPod commercial.) The band stopped just as independent music was becoming more financially significant—2004 was the year future indie-Grammy-holders <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a> landed<i>—</i>but traditional notions of integrity were also growing complicated. Brownstein was strangely prophetic: ""I took my money/ And bought me a TV/ TV brings me closer to the world."" This is music you make when you can sense it's one more hour 'til the walls close in.</p>
<p>Little is concrete in rock'n'roll—at the very least, its pivotal moments have often been shrouded in discrepancy and myth. Sister Rosetta Tharpe was the first guitar hero; no, Robert Johnson. Pete Townshend's guitar-smashing was auto-destructive art; no, Townshend's wrecked guitar was privilege. Elvis is dead; Elvis is in Las Vegas. Punk started in London—no, New York—girls started punk rock, not England. But there are unequivocal truths of Sleater-Kinney's career. Objectively, the trio was born of riot grrrl, an underground band that started with two girls together in a living room and became the movement's greatest critical success and so much more: an initial seven-album streak worthy of setting in stone eternal. There is an overcast art-print that accompanies <i>Start Together</i>, set at a weathered race track: Tucker is pounding pavement with a raised fist, Weiss is caught in a fierce skip, and Brownstein, in the middle, has both arms extended skyward, cracking a smile as if she just crushed a marathon. In reality, the band was only just beginning. Sleater-Kinney look invincible there, triumphant even, like superheroes, and if <i>Start Together</i> proves a thing, it is that with passion, persistence, and unwavering purpose, ordinary people can become them.</p></div>"|19860.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19860-sleater-kinney-start-together/|9.2|Jenn Pelly

I am wont to believe Carrie Brownstein when the Sleater-Kinney guitarist, then 21, qualified <a href=""http://meowonline.org/sleater-kinney-riot-grrrl-grows-up/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this 1996 assertion</a> by shrugging it off as a joke. She was, in all likelihood, alluding to the mainstream-affixed mantra of Seattle's blown-up grunge scene, which her own band's roots in the nearby punk-feminist community of Olympia opposed. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/349-bikini-kill/"">Bikini Kill</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"">Fugazi</a> before them, Sleater-Kinney would never succumb to the beckoning of major labels. And in 1996, with their crass punk insurrectionism, the idea of mass success was laughable. Of course, Brownstein's reputation for regional parody on <a href=""http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Portlandia""</a> now precedes her. ""We're never going to be huge like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3272-pearl-jam/"">Pearl Jam</a> or something,"" she said in that interview, ""but I want more people to have access to our music, not just the geeky kids."" Seven years later, in 2003, during the beginnings of the Iraq War, Sleater-Kinney played its <a href=""http://electrip.com/sleater-kinney/1html/showsH/2003shows.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first of many</a> arena-sized gigs—on tour with Pearl Jam.</p>
<p>From 1994 to 2006, Sleater-Kinney seemed to have it all. The trio of Brownstein, singer-guitarist Corin Tucker, and (from '96 on) drummer Janet Weiss created and then fervently revised one of the most distinctive sounds in rock: The friction of their overlapping voices—Brownstein's monotone speak-sing anchoring Tucker's wild vibrato—had an ecstatic, unusual beauty. The expressive longing of Tucker's alone was a gift, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6422-kathleen-hanna/"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hanna</a>'s hardcore holler aspiring to the quasi-operatics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2144-iron-maiden"">Iron Maiden</a>'s Bruce Dickinson. Tucker is perhaps the first punk singer to attempt such a thing while worshipping the enormity of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6279-aretha-franklin/"" target=""_blank"">Aretha Franklin</a>, channeling lessons from the Queen of Soul into her own singing, holding onto moments for dear life and then projecting them to the heavens, becoming <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTHpfZhfQbk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Queen of Rock</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, Sleater-Kinney were humble, imageless indie-rockers; in song, they demanded icon status. This streamlined set, <i>Start Together</i>, captures that dichotomy, archiving the Sleater-Kinney canon with care: from the ideological-punches of thirdwave feminism to their post-riot grrrl classic rock revisionism, all seven albums have been remastered and paired with a plainly gorgeous hardcover photobook, as well as the surprise of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17172-sleater-kinney-bury-our-friends/"" target=""_blank"">reunion-launching 7"" single</a>. In all, <i>Start Together</i> tells the unlikely story of how this band carried the wildfire of '90s Oly-punk to pastures of more ambitious musicality—a decade that moves from caterwauling shrieks to glowing lyricism, from barebones snark to Zep-length improv, from personal-political to outright (left) political.</p>
<p>Sleater-Kinney was consciously <i>about</i> rock'n'roll. Lou Reed sang for Jenny whose life was saved by rock; Ramones told us how Sheena became a punk. In 1994 there was no shortage of women plugging in—newly born classics included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6162-hole/"">Hole</a>'s <i>Live Through This</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair/"">Liz Phair</a>'s <i>Exile in Guyville</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"">PJ Harvey</a>'s <i>Rid of Me</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"">the Breeders</a>' <i>Last Splash—</i>but the lineage of larger-than-life stars, the deified behind-the-head-shredders, still had few instances of women delivering rock-as-saviour meta-narratives themselves. Sleater-Kinney turned the machismo of hippie-blooded '60s and '70s rock on its head: covers of Springsteen and CCR, homages to Kinks and the Clash, Brownstein's Pete Townshend windmills and shin-kicking swagger, Tucker's defiant declaration that ""I make rock'n'roll!"" A life-or-death seriousness is omnipresent with Sleater-Kinney, but they never rejected rock's base desires—sex, dancing, proverbial milkshakes—although sometimes they vaguely mocked them. Sleater-Kinney stole from men what men had in turn stolen from the margins: electrified blues that all still made girls scream.</p>
<p>The first Sleater-Kinney practice was in March of 1994. It was the spring that Kurt Cobain died. Hindsight paints it clear: Cobain's desire for a future-rock made by women dispersed into the universe. Brownstein and Tucker did Sleater-Kinney as a side-project to their respective bands, the queercore power-chord screams of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1FX46vIY88"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Excuse 17</a> and soul-baring punk of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v_bw-8adTU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heavens to Betsy</a>. Sleater-Kinney fused these politicized sounds, but as they grew—with affection for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/264-the-b-52s/"">B-52's</a> shimmy and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> cool—they never let the punk rulebook limit their vision. Riot grrrl was fragmenting and they learned from its successes and failures—a radical streak pervaded their writerly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8693-husker-du/"">Hüsker Dü</a>-type storytelling—but they also fought to not be removed from the context of their foundation. The wiry blast of 1995's <b><i>Sleater-Kinney</i></b> is as good an indicator of Bikini Kill's influence as any feminist album since, echoing their sound as well as an interest in making punk become activism.</p>
<p>The debut is foremost a rejection of heteronormative sex, as Tucker and Brownstein were reckoning with life inside their bodies as women who approached sexuality fluidly. There's a song about how much sucking dick sucks, called ""How to Play Dead""—it began Sleater-Kinney's mission of showing how society can silence women and minimize their problems. The urgency is real; all of <i>Sleater-Kinney</i> was scrappily-recorded in one night, on a trip to Australia, where they enlisted drummer Lora MacFarlane, who also kept-time on 1996's <i>Call the Doctor</i>. ""A Real Man"" is like an incendiary take on classic feminist text <i>The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm</i>: ""Don't you wanna feel it inside/ They say that it feels so nice,"" Tucker gasps with visceral sarcasm. Call it clit-rock, I guess; over hard-style riffs, Tucker makes it clear she won't wait ""to cum every time."" Amid this whirlwind of pleasure and pain, which occasionally veers towards emo, Brownstein and Tucker's whispers erupt on ""The Day I Went Away"", one of two wistful songs that foreshadow Sleater-Kinney's impending greatness.</p>
<p>Sleater-Kinney continued feeding its appetite for destruction of archetypes on 1996's <b><i>Call the Doctor</i></b>. It improved their raw punk convictions in every way: more complex guitarwork, more distortion to intellectualize, more aggression and profound sadness. ""Why do good things never wanna stay?"" Tucker asks on ""Good Things"", an earnest stomach-twister of a teardrop tune, while the dire ""Anonymous"" wonders why its female protagonist is voluntarily unspoken. ""I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone"" uses tradition to infiltrate and subvert—the riff could be Ramones pushing Stooges' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIqnXTqg8I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Wanna Be Your Dog""</a> into the red—to cleverly protest the worship of male icons and spur revolution: ""I wanna be your Joey Ramone/ Pictures of me on your bedroom door/ Invite you back after the show/ I'm the queen of rock and roll."" It's a two-and-half-minute rock'n'roll joyride deserving of a gender studies thesis.</p>
<p>Tucker's fierce and vulnerable depictions of unconventional love marked the title track, where the dueling vocals first exploded. ""It felt like something had opened up,"" Brownstein told <a href=""http://owsk.ms11.net/articles/rsarticle.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rolling Stone</i></a>. ""We just stopped. And [Corin] was like, ‘This is so awesome, you have to keep doing that.’ It felt like I had fused with her. This bolt of lightning had gone from my chest to hers."" <i>Call the Doctor</i> landed at number three on <i>The Village Voice</i>’s then-influential critic’s poll. Their label, Chainsaw, couldn’t press copies fast enough.</p>
<p>Then, behold: Janet Weiss. She joined on 1997's breakneck <b><i>Dig Me Out</i></b>, an all-time great American punk statement, giving Sleater-Kinney the most crucial muscle a drummer can offer: not sheer force, but heart, taking the momentum to a new plane. Sleater-Kinney released their next four records with the larger Olympia feminist label, <a href=""http://www.killrockstars.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kill Rock Stars</a>, but none distilled the band's sound and attitude like <i>Dig Me Out</i>: sometimes brutal heartache, sometimes a menacing threat, always intelligent and extreme, there are enough hooks architected into these two- and three-minute songs to span several albums, but even the added dum-de-dum sugar seems as though it must be raw Portland agave.</p>
<p>""Little Babies"" critiques stereotypes of motherhood, ""Heart Factory"" roars over synthetic emotions of the <i>Prozac Nation</i>, and the instantly classic ""Words and Guitar"" is an ode to rock that just feels necessary. At the peak of ""The Drama You've Been Craving""—Tucker's ""Kick it <i>OUT!</i>""—there are practically fireworks bursting on either side. Really, <i>Dig</i> goes from 0-to-100 within seconds of its opening salvo of a title track, which begs for transcendence from worldly oppression, ""Outta this mess/ Outta my head."" Unlike so much in the trajectory of punk, there is no nihilistic self-destruction in the face of chaos. More than skepticism, anti-consumerism, or the glories of tattoo art, punk teaches empathy, a principle Sleater-Kinney practiced with nuance. This is why Sleater-Kinney's music shines a light despite its loudness, why it is easy to be alone with the songs and feel protected. Sleater-Kinney would never forego the optimism to believe their songbook could make us smarter, angrier, more tender and hopeful. <i>Dig Me Out </i>dreams of a better future, clawing itself up with every note.</p>
<p>The highlight of <i>Dig Me Out</i> and Sleater-Kinney's career, ""One More Hour"" is one of the most devastating break-up songs in rock. ""Oh, you've got the darkest eyes,"" Tucker and Brownstein quaver in unison—the song is about their own short-lived romance—and the way Tucker extends the last word, it is like she can't let them go. There are complex feelings near clear ones, which is what break-ups are: someone wants to untangle the mess, someone wants to snip it apart. ""I needed it,"" Tucker howls, hardly distinguishing where one word ends and another begins. ""One More Hour"" is sublime sadness, a kind one can only know when staring at the end of something and wanting desperately for it not to be so. </p>
<p>This feeling would root 1999's atmospheric <b><i>The Hot Rock</i></b>: subdued and spiritual, it served a number of firsts for Sleater-Kinney, among them a slot on the Billboard charts (at 181). Tucker, Brownstein, and Weiss had never sounded so introspective, existential, and dark, so aesthetically poetic and conventionally pretty. The album's interlocking parts were influenced by the gentle alterna-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1737-the-go-betweens/"">Go-Betweens</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a>; voices intertwine gracefully, as if braiding together dreams and wounds. It's the Sleater-Kinney record you're most likely to play on a train while gazing out the window and getting lost in thought.</p>
<p>Brownstein and Tucker sang of personal becoming, the uncertainties of adulthood, dying relationships and technological paranoia—it was, after all, the year before tin-foil Y2K Bugs would signal the end civilization—sometimes with abstract metaphors. The jaw-dropping despair of Brownstein's wearied ballad ""The Size of Our Love"" has a lonely ambience, a love-story plaintively set between hospital walls: ""The ring on my finger/ So tight it turns blue,"" she sings over a crying viola. ""A constant reminder/ I'll die in this room/ If you die in this room."" It's unsurprising that Brownstein has since catapulted her storylines to a mass scale: Comedians are professionals at manipulating our emotions, and if it is one's intention to make people laugh, it must help to have mastered the ability to make them cry.</p>
<p>The sun, ocean, and cosmos build the imagistic single, ""Get Up"". A staccato riff quilts the emphatic drumming, and the guitar tones are magic—had the band not called those natural elements out, it's evident that ""Get Up"" absorbed their expanses. Tucker's hovering speak-sing evokes Kim Gordon beaming down from an imagined heaven on Sonic Youth's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reSOp1domrU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tunic (Song for Karen)""</a>. Echoing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3842-patti-smith/"">Patti Smith</a> as well, Tucker's words fly into the air as if given wings—""Goodbye small hands/ Goodbye small heart/ Goodbye small head""—zen-like as she watches her body go, ""like a whole bucket of stars dumped into the universe."" Sleater-Kinney didn't necessarily follow their '60s rock predecessors into ashram training, but this reflects the Eastern belief that when you die, you become a part of nature. Tucker works through primal desires—""Do you think I'm an animal? Am I not?""—and despite the textured makeover, <i>The Hot Rock</i> emerges as one of Sleater-Kinney's heaviest records.</p>
<p>Swinging back to capital-R Rock, 2000's <b><i>All Hands on the Bad One</i></b> was Sleater-Kinney's most straight-ahead arbiter of thirdwave feminism and also, surprisingly, their most jovial record. Sing-song guitar-pop turned up alongside plainspoken take-downs of sexism in music, and hints of new wave, girl-groups and Go-Gos mixed (cohesively, too) with some of their hardest whiplash-rippers. The enormously hooky ""You're No Rock n' Roll Fun"" taunts dry girl-averse indie snobs: ""You're no rock'n'roll fun/ Like a piece of art that no one can touch!"" the trio sang together, throwing ""whiskey drinks and chocolate bars"" at these guys to shake up the mood, 'cause why not? When Sleater-Kinney note how ""the best man won't hang out with the girl BAA-AAND!"" we're only left wondering why he'd pass on such fun.</p>
<p>Similar humor plays out on ""Milkshake n' Honey"", a <i>Spinal Tap</i>-esque wink at the debauched rocker/groupie complex, but the incisive messages make the best songs: ""The Professional"" uses charged surf-punk to condemn the marginalizing of women in music, ""Male Model"" dismantles the sexist canon and rejects investigations of women's authenticity. A lyrics sheet proves <i>Bad One</i> is Sleater-Kinney's most direct sloganeering, but it doesn't come off as such; Tucker's ferocity and Brownstein's French-sung interjections make it cool, even. ""#1 Must Have"" is the centerpiece, in which Tucker dissects the commodification of riot grrrl and—in light of the rapes at Woodstock in '99—powerfully asserts, ""The number one must-have/ Is that we are safe."" The song's lasting relevance can't be overstated.</p>
<p>The world was irreversibly changed by the time of 2002's <b><i>One Beat</i></b>, Sleater-Kinney's weightiest record. Adventuring with math rock and stomping horns, it was their most explicitly political album, grappling with the aftermath of 9/11 on ""Far Away"" and ""Combat Rock"". These songs reflected the national headspace as selflessly as any act of using someone's tragedy for art allows. Tucker questioned the all-or-nothing patriotism sweeping the U.S., and detailed her own experience that day with raw catharsis, calling-out the hidden President Bush, honoring those who served, and striving for a glimmer of kindness: ""I look to the sky/ And ask it not to rain."" <i>One Beat </i>was not all war songs—the bouncy organ-led love-anthem ""Oh!"" had glammy inflections, ""Prisstina"" chronicled an outcast's discovery of rock. The closer, ""Sympathy"", rips instrumentation from ""Sympathy for the Devil"" but inverts its theme, a prayer for the life of Tucker's premature-born child: ""There is no righteousness in your darkest moment,"" Tucker belts, ""We're all equal in the face of what we're most afraid.""</p>
<p>Even the scope of <i>One Beat</i> couldn't predict Sleater-Kinney's monstrous phase-one farewell, 2005's <b><i>The Woods</i></b><i>. </i>The band's appeal had become that of the indie rock mainstream, and a suburban high-schooler (such as myself, then) could readily learn of <i>The Woods</i>' greatness from the same weirdo dude-friends who repped new CDs by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"">the White Stripes</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a> (like I did). Sleater-Kinney had just played arenas with Pearl Jam, bending notes into heavier, looser sounds, when they journeyed upstate New York to track <i>The Woods</i> with producer David Fridmann, himself only two years removed from helping turn Flaming Lips' 2002 opus <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3081-yoshimi-battles-the-pink-robots/"">Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</a> </i>into a wider breakout.</p>

Punk started in London—no, New York—girls started punk rock, not England. But there are unequivocal truths of Sleater-Kinney's career. Objectively, the trio was born of riot grrrl, an underground band that started with two girls together in a living room and became the movement's greatest critical success and so much more: an initial seven-album streak worthy of setting in stone eternal. There is an overcast art-print that accompanies <i>Start Together</i>, set at a weathered race track: Tucker is pounding pavement with a raised fist, Weiss is caught in a fierce skip, and Brownstein, in the middle, has both arms extended skyward, cracking a smile as if she just crushed a marathon.

<p>From 1994 to 2006, Sleater-Kinney seemed to have it all. The trio of Brownstein, singer-guitarist Corin Tucker, and (from '96 on) drummer Janet Weiss created and then fervently revised one of the most distinctive sounds in rock: The friction of their overlapping voices—Brownstein's monotone speak-sing anchoring Tucker's wild vibrato—had an ecstatic, unusual beauty. The expressive longing of Tucker's alone was a gift, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6422-kathleen-hanna/"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hanna</a>'s hardcore holler aspiring to the quasi-operatics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2144-iron-maiden"">Iron Maiden</a>'s Bruce Dickinson. Tucker is perhaps the first punk singer to attempt such a thing while worshipping the enormity of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6279-aretha-franklin/"" target=""_blank"">Aretha Franklin</a>, channeling lessons from the Queen of Soul into her own singing, holding onto moments for dear life and then projecting them to the heavens, becoming <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTHpfZhfQbk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Queen of Rock</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, Sleater-Kinney were humble, imageless indie-rockers; in song, they demanded icon status. This streamlined set, <i>Start Together</i>, captures that dichotomy, archiving the Sleater-Kinney canon with care: from the ideological-punches of thirdwave feminism to their post-riot grrrl classic rock revisionism, all seven albums have been remastered and paired with a plainly gorgeous hardcover photobook, as well as the surprise of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17172-sleater-kinney-bury-our-friends/"" target=""_blank"">reunion-launching 7"" single</a>. In all, <i>Start Together</i> tells the unlikely story of how this band carried the wildfire of '90s Oly-punk to pastures of more ambitious musicality—a decade that moves from caterwauling shrieks to glowing lyricism, from barebones snark to Zep-length improv, from personal-political to outright (left) political.</p>
<p>Sleater-Kinney was consciously <i>about</i> rock'n'roll. Lou Reed sang for Jenny whose life was saved by rock; Ramones told us how Sheena became a punk. In 1994 there was no shortage of women plugging in—newly born classics included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6162-hole/"">Hole</a>'s <i>Live Through This</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair/"">Liz Phair</a>'s <i>Exile in Guyville</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"">PJ Harvey</a>'s <i>Rid of Me</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"">the Breeders</a>' <i>Last Splash—</i>but the lineage of larger-than-life stars, the deified behind-the-head-shredders, still had few instances of women delivering rock-as-saviour meta-narratives themselves. Sleater-Kinney turned the machismo of hippie-blooded '60s and '70s rock on its head: covers of Springsteen and CCR, homages to Kinks and the Clash, Brownstein's Pete Townshend windmills and shin-kicking swagger, Tucker's defiant declaration that ""I make rock'n'roll!"" A life-or-death seriousness is omnipresent with Sleater-Kinney, but they never rejected rock's base desires—sex, dancing, proverbial milkshakes—although sometimes they vaguely mocked them. Sleater-Kinney stole from men what men had in turn stolen from the margins: electrified blues that all still made girls scream.</p>
<p>The first Sleater-Kinney practice was in March of 1994. It was the spring that Kurt Cobain died. Hindsight paints it clear: Cobain's desire for a future-rock made by women dispersed into the universe. Brownstein and Tucker did Sleater-Kinney as a side-project to their respective bands, the queercore power-chord screams of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1FX46vIY88"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Excuse 17</a> and soul-baring punk of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v_bw-8adTU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heavens to Betsy</a>. Sleater-Kinney fused these politicized sounds, but as they grew—with affection for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/264-the-b-52s/"">B-52's</a> shimmy and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> cool—they never let the punk rulebook limit their vision. Riot grrrl was fragmenting and they learned from its successes and failures—a radical streak pervaded their writerly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8693-husker-du/"">Hüsker Dü</a>-type storytelling—but they also fought to not be removed from the context of their foundation. The wiry blast of 1995's <b><i>Sleater-Kinney</i></b> is as good an indicator of Bikini Kill's influence as any feminist album since, echoing their sound as well as an interest in making punk become activism.</p>
<p>The debut is foremost a rejection of heteronormative sex, as Tucker and Brownstein were reckoning with life inside their bodies as women who approached sexuality fluidly. There's a song about how much sucking dick sucks, called ""How to Play Dead""—it began Sleater-Kinney's mission of showing how society can silence women and minimize their problems. The urgency is real; all of <i>Sleater-Kinney</i> was scrappily-recorded in one night, on a trip to Australia, where they enlisted drummer Lora MacFarlane, who also kept-time on 1996's <i>Call the Doctor</i>. ""A Real Man"" is like an incendiary take on classic feminist text <i>The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm</i>: ""Don't you wanna feel it inside/ They say that it feels so nice,"" Tucker gasps with visceral sarcasm. Call it clit-rock, I guess; over hard-style riffs, Tucker makes it clear she won't wait ""to cum every time."" Amid this whirlwind of pleasure and pain, which occasionally veers towards emo, Brownstein and Tucker's whispers erupt on ""The Day I Went Away"", one of two wistful songs that foreshadow Sleater-Kinney's impending greatness.</p>
<p>Sleater-Kinney continued feeding its appetite for destruction of archetypes on 1996's <b><i>Call the Doctor</i></b>. It improved their raw punk convictions in every way: more complex guitarwork, more distortion to intellectualize, more aggression and profound sadness. ""Why do good things never wanna stay?"" Tucker asks on ""Good Things"", an earnest stomach-twister of a teardrop tune, while the dire ""Anonymous"" wonders why its female protagonist is voluntarily unspoken. ""I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone"" uses tradition to infiltrate and subvert—the riff could be Ramones pushing Stooges' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIqnXTqg8I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Wanna Be Your Dog""</a> into the red—to cleverly protest the worship of male icons and spur revolution: ""I wanna be your Joey Ramone/ Pictures of me on your bedroom door/ Invite you back after the show/ I'm the queen of rock and roll."" It's a two-and-half-minute rock'n'roll joyride deserving of a gender studies thesis.</p>
<p>Tucker's fierce and vulnerable depictions of unconventional love marked the title track, where the dueling vocals first exploded. ""It felt like something had opened up,"" Brownstein told <a href=""http://owsk.ms11.net/articles/rsarticle.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rolling Stone</i></a>. ""We just stopped. And [Corin] was like, ‘This is so awesome, you have to keep doing that.’ It felt like I had fused with her. This bolt of lightning had gone from my chest to hers."" <i>Call the Doctor</i> landed at number three on <i>The Village Voice</i>’s then-influential critic’s poll. Their label, Chainsaw, couldn’t press copies fast enough.</p>
<p>Then, behold: Janet Weiss. She joined on 1997's breakneck <b><i>Dig Me Out</i></b>, an all-time great American punk statement, giving Sleater-Kinney the most crucial muscle a drummer can offer: not sheer force, but heart, taking the momentum to a new plane. Sleater-Kinney released their next four records with the larger Olympia feminist label, <a href=""http://www.killrockstars.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kill Rock Stars</a>, but none distilled the band's sound and attitude like <i>Dig Me Out</i>: sometimes brutal heartache, sometimes a menacing threat, always intelligent and extreme, there are enough hooks architected into these two- and three-minute songs to span several albums, but even the added dum-de-dum sugar seems as though it must be raw Portland agave.</p>
<p>""Little Babies"" critiques stereotypes of motherhood, ""Heart Factory"" roars over synthetic emotions of the <i>Prozac Nation</i>, and the instantly classic ""Words and Guitar"" is an ode to rock that just feels necessary. At the peak of ""The Drama You've Been Craving""—Tucker's ""Kick it <i>OUT!</i>""—there are practically fireworks bursting on either side. Really, <i>Dig</i> goes from 0-to-100 within seconds of its opening salvo of a title track, which begs for transcendence from worldly oppression, ""Outta this mess/ Outta my head."" Unlike so much in the trajectory of punk, there is no nihilistic self-destruction in the face of chaos. More than skepticism, anti-consumerism, or the glories of tattoo art, punk teaches empathy, a principle Sleater-Kinney practiced with nuance. This is why Sleater-Kinney's music shines a light despite its loudness, why it is easy to be alone with the songs and feel protected. Sleater-Kinney would never forego the optimism to believe their songbook could make us smarter, angrier, more tender and hopeful. <i>Dig Me Out </i>dreams of a better future, clawing itself up with every note.</p>
<p>The highlight of <i>Dig Me Out</i> and Sleater-Kinney's career, ""One More Hour"" is one of the most devastating break-up songs in rock. ""Oh, you've got the darkest eyes,"" Tucker and Brownstein quaver in unison—the song is about their own short-lived romance—and the way Tucker extends the last word, it is like she can't let them go. There are complex feelings near clear ones, which is what break-ups are: someone wants to untangle the mess, someone wants to snip it apart. ""I needed it,"" Tucker howls, hardly distinguishing where one word ends and another begins. ""One More Hour"" is sublime sadness, a kind one can only know when staring at the end of something and wanting desperately for it not to be so. </p>
<p>This feeling would root 1999's atmospheric <b><i>The Hot Rock</i></b>: subdued and spiritual, it served a number of firsts for Sleater-Kinney, among them a slot on the Billboard charts (at 181). Tucker, Brownstein, and Weiss had never sounded so introspective, existential, and dark, so aesthetically poetic and conventionally pretty. The album's interlocking parts were influenced by the gentle alterna-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1737-the-go-betweens/"">Go-Betweens</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a>; voices intertwine gracefully, as if braiding together dreams and wounds. It's the Sleater-Kinney record you're most likely to play on a train while gazing out the window and getting lost in thought.</p>
<p>Brownstein and Tucker sang of personal becoming, the uncertainties of adulthood, dying relationships and technological paranoia—it was, after all, the year before tin-foil Y2K Bugs would signal the end civilization—sometimes with abstract metaphors. The jaw-dropping despair of Brownstein's wearied ballad ""The Size of Our Love"" has a lonely ambience, a love-story plaintively set between hospital walls: ""The ring on my finger/ So tight it turns blue,"" she sings over a crying viola. ""A constant reminder/ I'll die in this room/ If you die in this room."" It's unsurprising that Brownstein has since catapulted her storylines to a mass scale: Comedians are professionals at manipulating our emotions, and if it is one's intention to make people laugh, it must help to have mastered the ability to make them cry.</p>
<p>The sun, ocean, and cosmos build the imagistic single, ""Get Up"". A staccato riff quilts the emphatic drumming, and the guitar tones are magic—had the band not called those natural elements out, it's evident that ""Get Up"" absorbed their expanses. Tucker's hovering speak-sing evokes Kim Gordon beaming down from an imagined heaven on Sonic Youth's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reSOp1domrU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tunic (Song for Karen)""</a>. Echoing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3842-patti-smith/"">Patti Smith</a> as well, Tucker's words fly into the air as if given wings—""Goodbye small hands/ Goodbye small heart/ Goodbye small head""—zen-like as she watches her body go, ""like a whole bucket of stars dumped into the universe."" Sleater-Kinney didn't necessarily follow their '60s rock predecessors into ashram training, but this reflects the Eastern belief that when you die, you become a part of nature. Tucker works through primal desires—""Do you think I'm an animal? Am I not?""—and despite the textured makeover, <i>The Hot Rock</i> emerges as one of Sleater-Kinney's heaviest records.</p>
<p>Swinging back to capital-R Rock, 2000's <b><i>All Hands on the Bad One</i></b> was Sleater-Kinney's most straight-ahead arbiter of thirdwave feminism and also, surprisingly, their most jovial record. Sing-song guitar-pop turned up alongside plainspoken take-downs of sexism in music, and hints of new wave, girl-groups and Go-Gos mixed (cohesively, too) with some of their hardest whiplash-rippers. The enormously hooky ""You're No Rock n' Roll Fun"" taunts dry girl-averse indie snobs: ""You're no rock'n'roll fun/ Like a piece of art that no one can touch!"" the trio sang together, throwing ""whiskey drinks and chocolate bars"" at these guys to shake up the mood, 'cause why not? When Sleater-Kinney note how ""the best man won't hang out with the girl BAA-AAND!"" we're only left wondering why he'd pass on such fun.</p>
<p>Similar humor plays out on ""Milkshake n' Honey"", a <i>Spinal Tap</i>-esque wink at the debauched rocker/groupie complex, but the incisive messages make the best songs: ""The Professional"" uses charged surf-punk to condemn the marginalizing of women in music, ""Male Model"" dismantles the sexist canon and rejects investigations of women's authenticity. A lyrics sheet proves <i>Bad One</i> is Sleater-Kinney's most direct sloganeering, but it doesn't come off as such; Tucker's ferocity and Brownstein's French-sung interjections make it cool, even. ""#1 Must Have"" is the centerpiece, in which Tucker dissects the commodification of riot grrrl and—in light of the rapes at Woodstock in '99—powerfully asserts, ""The number one must-have/ Is that we are safe."" The song's lasting relevance can't be overstated.</p>
<p>The world was irreversibly changed by the time of 2002's <b><i>One Beat</i></b>, Sleater-Kinney's weightiest record. Adventuring with math rock and stomping horns, it was their most explicitly political album, grappling with the aftermath of 9/11 on ""Far Away"" and ""Combat Rock"". These songs reflected the national headspace as selflessly as any act of using someone's tragedy for art allows. Tucker questioned the all-or-nothing patriotism sweeping the U.S., and detailed her own experience that day with raw catharsis, calling-out the hidden President Bush, honoring those who served, and striving for a glimmer of kindness: ""I look to the sky/ And ask it not to rain."" <i>One Beat </i>was not all war songs—the bouncy organ-led love-anthem ""Oh!"" had glammy inflections, ""Prisstina"" chronicled an outcast's discovery of rock. The closer, ""Sympathy"", rips instrumentation from ""Sympathy for the Devil"" but inverts its theme, a prayer for the life of Tucker's premature-born child: ""There is no righteousness in your darkest moment,"" Tucker belts, ""We're all equal in the face of what we're most afraid.""</p>
<p>Even the scope of <i>One Beat</i> couldn't predict Sleater-Kinney's monstrous phase-one farewell, 2005's <b><i>The Woods</i></b><i>. </i>The band's appeal had become that of the indie rock mainstream, and a suburban high-schooler (such as myself, then) could readily learn of <i>The Woods</i>' greatness from the same weirdo dude-friends who repped new CDs by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"">the White Stripes</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a> (like I did). Sleater-Kinney had just played arenas with Pearl Jam, bending notes into heavier, looser sounds, when they journeyed upstate New York to track <i>The Woods</i> with producer David Fridmann, himself only two years removed from helping turn Flaming Lips' 2002 opus <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3081-yoshimi-battles-the-pink-robots/"">Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</a> </i>into a wider breakout.</p>
<p>When your best work is also your most uncompromising and unintelligible, you have accomplished a considerable artistic feat—this was the <i>The Woods</i>. It was tracked live with more distortion than usual, giving it a freneticism, a deranged euphoria. ""[Friddman would] say things to Janet like, 'Play like Keith Moon, but Keith Moon with a blanket coming down over him,'"" Tucker <a href=""http://www.sfbg.com/39/34/cover_music_the_woods.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. That possessed orchestra-of-rhythm translated. The album's heaving 11-minute mega-solo, ""Let's Call It Love"", and the soulful echo ""Night Light"", comprise a grandiose jam colored in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12181-deep-purple/"" target=""_blank"">Deep Purple</a>. Zep riffs abound. ""Entertain"" is an atypical military march, declaring war on hollow retro rock; its ""woah-oh-ohs"" are more like shields than exaltations. ""You come around looking 1984/ You're such a bore, 1984/ Nostalgia, you're using it like a whore""—Brownstein's Orwellian invocation opposes this music with a far more poetic dismissal than ""Fuck Interpol."" Sleater-Kinney's first six records gave a lens through which we might imagine a feminist rewrite of classic rock; <i>The Woods</i> is a front-row seat.</p>
<p>""Jumpers"" was inspired by<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/10/13/jumpers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> a <i>New Yorker</i></a> piece on suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge—""the intensity of feeling that you can't find meaning in your life, so you need to find meaning in your death,"" <a href=""http://www.sfbg.com/39/34/cover_music_the_woods.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brownstein said</a>—which oddly befit the band's decision to end on top.

In all, <i>Start Together</i> tells the unlikely story of how this band carried the wildfire of '90s Oly-punk to pastures of more ambitious musicality—a decade that moves from caterwauling shrieks to glowing lyricism, from barebones snark to Zep-length improv, from personal-political to outright (left) political.</p>
<p>Sleater-Kinney was consciously <i>about</i> rock'n'roll. Lou Reed sang for Jenny whose life was saved by rock; Ramones told us how Sheena became a punk. In 1994 there was no shortage of women plugging in—newly born classics included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6162-hole/"">Hole</a>'s <i>Live Through This</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair/"">Liz Phair</a>'s <i>Exile in Guyville</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"">PJ Harvey</a>'s <i>Rid of Me</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"">the Breeders</a>' <i>Last Splash—</i>but the lineage of larger-than-life stars, the deified behind-the-head-shredders, still had few instances of women delivering rock-as-saviour meta-narratives themselves. Sleater-Kinney turned the machismo of hippie-blooded '60s and '70s rock on its head: covers of Springsteen and CCR, homages to Kinks and the Clash, Brownstein's Pete Townshend windmills and shin-kicking swagger, Tucker's defiant declaration that ""I make rock'n'roll!"" A life-or-death seriousness is omnipresent with Sleater-Kinney, but they never rejected rock's base desires—sex, dancing, proverbial milkshakes—although sometimes they vaguely mocked them. Sleater-Kinney stole from men what men had in turn stolen from the margins: electrified blues that all still made girls scream.</p>
<p>The first Sleater-Kinney practice was in March of 1994. It was the spring that Kurt Cobain died. Hindsight paints it clear: Cobain's desire for a future-rock made by women dispersed into the universe. Brownstein and Tucker did Sleater-Kinney as a side-project to their respective bands, the queercore power-chord screams of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1FX46vIY88"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Excuse 17</a> and soul-baring punk of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v_bw-8adTU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heavens to Betsy</a>. Sleater-Kinney fused these politicized sounds, but as they grew—with affection for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/264-the-b-52s/"">B-52's</a> shimmy and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> cool—they never let the punk rulebook limit their vision. Riot grrrl was fragmenting and they learned from its successes and failures—a radical streak pervaded their writerly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8693-husker-du/"">Hüsker Dü</a>-type storytelling—but they also fought to not be removed from the context of their foundation. The wiry blast of 1995's <b><i>Sleater-Kinney</i></b> is as good an indicator of Bikini Kill's influence as any feminist album since, echoing their sound as well as an interest in making punk become activism.</p>
<p>The debut is foremost a rejection of heteronormative sex, as Tucker and Brownstein were reckoning with life inside their bodies as women who approached sexuality fluidly. There's a song about how much sucking dick sucks, called ""How to Play Dead""—it began Sleater-Kinney's mission of showing how society can silence women and minimize their problems. The urgency is real; all of <i>Sleater-Kinney</i> was scrappily-recorded in one night, on a trip to Australia, where they enlisted drummer Lora MacFarlane, who also kept-time on 1996's <i>Call the Doctor</i>. ""A Real Man"" is like an incendiary take on classic feminist text <i>The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm</i>: ""Don't you wanna feel it inside/ They say that it feels so nice,"" Tucker gasps with visceral sarcasm. Call it clit-rock, I guess; over hard-style riffs, Tucker makes it clear she won't wait ""to cum every time."" Amid this whirlwind of pleasure and pain, which occasionally veers towards emo, Brownstein and Tucker's whispers erupt on ""The Day I Went Away"", one of two wistful songs that foreshadow Sleater-Kinney's impending greatness.</p>
<p>Sleater-Kinney continued feeding its appetite for destruction of archetypes on 1996's <b><i>Call the Doctor</i></b>. It improved their raw punk convictions in every way: more complex guitarwork, more distortion to intellectualize, more aggression and profound sadness. ""Why do good things never wanna stay?"" Tucker asks on ""Good Things"", an earnest stomach-twister of a teardrop tune, while the dire ""Anonymous"" wonders why its female protagonist is voluntarily unspoken. ""I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone"" uses tradition to infiltrate and subvert—the riff could be Ramones pushing Stooges' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIqnXTqg8I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Wanna Be Your Dog""</a> into the red—to cleverly protest the worship of male icons and spur revolution: ""I wanna be your Joey Ramone/ Pictures of me on your bedroom door/ Invite you back after the show/ I'm the queen of rock and roll."" It's a two-and-half-minute rock'n'roll joyride deserving of a gender studies thesis.</p>
<p>Tucker's fierce and vulnerable depictions of unconventional love marked the title track, where the dueling vocals first exploded. ""It felt like something had opened up,"" Brownstein told <a href=""http://owsk.ms11.net/articles/rsarticle.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rolling Stone</i></a>. ""We just stopped. And [Corin] was like, ‘This is so awesome, you have to keep doing that.’ It felt like I had fused with her. This bolt of lightning had gone from my chest to hers."" <i>Call the Doctor</i> landed at number three on <i>The Village Voice</i>’s then-influential critic’s poll. Their label, Chainsaw, couldn’t press copies fast enough.</p>
<p>Then, behold: Janet Weiss. She joined on 1997's breakneck <b><i>Dig Me Out</i></b>, an all-time great American punk statement, giving Sleater-Kinney the most crucial muscle a drummer can offer: not sheer force, but heart, taking the momentum to a new plane. Sleater-Kinney released their next four records with the larger Olympia feminist label, <a href=""http://www.killrockstars.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kill Rock Stars</a>, but none distilled the band's sound and attitude like <i>Dig Me Out</i>: sometimes brutal heartache, sometimes a menacing threat, always intelligent and extreme, there are enough hooks architected into these two- and three-minute songs to span several albums, but even the added dum-de-dum sugar seems as though it must be raw Portland agave.</p>
<p>""Little Babies"" critiques stereotypes of motherhood, ""Heart Factory"" roars over synthetic emotions of the <i>Prozac Nation</i>, and the instantly classic ""Words and Guitar"" is an ode to rock that just feels necessary. At the peak of ""The Drama You've Been Craving""—Tucker's ""Kick it <i>OUT!</i>""—there are practically fireworks bursting on either side. Really, <i>Dig</i> goes from 0-to-100 within seconds of its opening salvo of a title track, which begs for transcendence from worldly oppression, ""Outta this mess/ Outta my head."" Unlike so much in the trajectory of punk, there is no nihilistic self-destruction in the face of chaos. More than skepticism, anti-consumerism, or the glories of tattoo art, punk teaches empathy, a principle Sleater-Kinney practiced with nuance. This is why Sleater-Kinney's music shines a light despite its loudness, why it is easy to be alone with the songs and feel protected. Sleater-Kinney would never forego the optimism to believe their songbook could make us smarter, angrier, more tender and hopeful. <i>Dig Me Out </i>dreams of a better future, clawing itself up with every note.</p>
<p>The highlight of <i>Dig Me Out</i> and Sleater-Kinney's career, ""One More Hour"" is one of the most devastating break-up songs in rock. ""Oh, you've got the darkest eyes,"" Tucker and Brownstein quaver in unison—the song is about their own short-lived romance—and the way Tucker extends the last word, it is like she can't let them go. There are complex feelings near clear ones, which is what break-ups are: someone wants to untangle the mess, someone wants to snip it apart. ""I needed it,"" Tucker howls, hardly distinguishing where one word ends and another begins. ""One More Hour"" is sublime sadness, a kind one can only know when staring at the end of something and wanting desperately for it not to be so. </p>
<p>This feeling would root 1999's atmospheric <b><i>The Hot Rock</i></b>: subdued and spiritual, it served a number of firsts for Sleater-Kinney, among them a slot on the Billboard charts (at 181). Tucker, Brownstein, and Weiss had never sounded so introspective, existential, and dark, so aesthetically poetic and conventionally pretty. The album's interlocking parts were influenced by the gentle alterna-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1737-the-go-betweens/"">Go-Betweens</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a>; voices intertwine gracefully, as if braiding together dreams and wounds. It's the Sleater-Kinney record you're most likely to play on a train while gazing out the window and getting lost in thought.</p>
<p>Brownstein and Tucker sang of personal becoming, the uncertainties of adulthood, dying relationships and technological paranoia—it was, after all, the year before tin-foil Y2K Bugs would signal the end civilization—sometimes with abstract metaphors. The jaw-dropping despair of Brownstein's wearied ballad ""The Size of Our Love"" has a lonely ambience, a love-story plaintively set between hospital walls: ""The ring on my finger/ So tight it turns blue,"" she sings over a crying viola. ""A constant reminder/ I'll die in this room/ If you die in this room."" It's unsurprising that Brownstein has since catapulted her storylines to a mass scale: Comedians are professionals at manipulating our emotions, and if it is one's intention to make people laugh, it must help to have mastered the ability to make them cry.</p>
<p>The sun, ocean, and cosmos build the imagistic single, ""Get Up"". A staccato riff quilts the emphatic drumming, and the guitar tones are magic—had the band not called those natural elements out, it's evident that ""Get Up"" absorbed their expanses. Tucker's hovering speak-sing evokes Kim Gordon beaming down from an imagined heaven on Sonic Youth's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reSOp1domrU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tunic (Song for Karen)""</a>. Echoing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3842-patti-smith/"">Patti Smith</a> as well, Tucker's words fly into the air as if given wings—""Goodbye small hands/ Goodbye small heart/ Goodbye small head""—zen-like as she watches her body go, ""like a whole bucket of stars dumped into the universe."" Sleater-Kinney didn't necessarily follow their '60s rock predecessors into ashram training, but this reflects the Eastern belief that when you die, you become a part of nature. Tucker works through primal desires—""Do you think I'm an animal? Am I not?""—and despite the textured makeover, <i>The Hot Rock</i> emerges as one of Sleater-Kinney's heaviest records.</p>
<p>Swinging back to capital-R Rock, 2000's <b><i>All Hands on the Bad One</i></b> was Sleater-Kinney's most straight-ahead arbiter of thirdwave feminism and also, surprisingly, their most jovial record. Sing-song guitar-pop turned up alongside plainspoken take-downs of sexism in music, and hints of new wave, girl-groups and Go-Gos mixed (cohesively, too) with some of their hardest whiplash-rippers. The enormously hooky ""You're No Rock n' Roll Fun"" taunts dry girl-averse indie snobs: ""You're no rock'n'roll fun/ Like a piece of art that no one can touch!"" the trio sang together, throwing ""whiskey drinks and chocolate bars"" at these guys to shake up the mood, 'cause why not? When Sleater-Kinney note how ""the best man won't hang out with the girl BAA-AAND!"" we're only left wondering why he'd pass on such fun.</p>
<p>Similar humor plays out on ""Milkshake n' Honey"", a <i>Spinal Tap</i>-esque wink at the debauched rocker/groupie complex, but the incisive messages make the best songs: ""The Professional"" uses charged surf-punk to condemn the marginalizing of women in music, ""Male Model"" dismantles the sexist canon and rejects investigations of women's authenticity. A lyrics sheet proves <i>Bad One</i> is Sleater-Kinney's most direct sloganeering, but it doesn't come off as such; Tucker's ferocity and Brownstein's French-sung interjections make it cool, even. ""#1 Must Have"" is the centerpiece, in which Tucker dissects the commodification of riot grrrl and—in light of the rapes at Woodstock in '99—powerfully asserts, ""The number one must-have/ Is that we are safe."" The song's lasting relevance can't be overstated.</p>
<p>The world was irreversibly changed by the time of 2002's <b><i>One Beat</i></b>, Sleater-Kinney's weightiest record. Adventuring with math rock and stomping horns, it was their most explicitly political album, grappling with the aftermath of 9/11 on ""Far Away"" and ""Combat Rock"". These songs reflected the national headspace as selflessly as any act of using someone's tragedy for art allows. Tucker questioned the all-or-nothing patriotism sweeping the U.S., and detailed her own experience that day with raw catharsis, calling-out the hidden President Bush, honoring those who served, and striving for a glimmer of kindness: ""I look to the sky/ And ask it not to rain."" <i>One Beat </i>was not all war songs—the bouncy organ-led love-anthem ""Oh!"" had glammy inflections, ""Prisstina"" chronicled an outcast's discovery of rock. The closer, ""Sympathy"", rips instrumentation from ""Sympathy for the Devil"" but inverts its theme, a prayer for the life of Tucker's premature-born child: ""There is no righteousness in your darkest moment,"" Tucker belts, ""We're all equal in the face of what we're most afraid.""</p>
<p>Even the scope of <i>One Beat</i> couldn't predict Sleater-Kinney's monstrous phase-one farewell, 2005's <b><i>The Woods</i></b><i>. </i>The band's appeal had become that of the indie rock mainstream, and a suburban high-schooler (such as myself, then) could readily learn of <i>The Woods</i>' greatness from the same weirdo dude-friends who repped new CDs by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"">the White Stripes</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a> (like I did). Sleater-Kinney had just played arenas with Pearl Jam, bending notes into heavier, looser sounds, when they journeyed upstate New York to track <i>The Woods</i> with producer David Fridmann, himself only two years removed from helping turn Flaming Lips' 2002 opus <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3081-yoshimi-battles-the-pink-robots/"">Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</a> </i>into a wider breakout.</p>
<p>When your best work is also your most uncompromising and unintelligible, you have accomplished a considerable artistic feat—this was the <i>The Woods</i>. It was tracked live with more distortion than usual, giving it a freneticism, a deranged euphoria. ""[Friddman would] say things to Janet like, 'Play like Keith Moon, but Keith Moon with a blanket coming down over him,'"" Tucker <a href=""http://www.sfbg.com/39/34/cover_music_the_woods.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. That possessed orchestra-of-rhythm translated. The album's heaving 11-minute mega-solo, ""Let's Call It Love"", and the soulful echo ""Night Light"", comprise a grandiose jam colored in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12181-deep-purple/"" target=""_blank"">Deep Purple</a>. Zep riffs abound. ""Entertain"" is an atypical military march, declaring war on hollow retro rock; its ""woah-oh-ohs"" are more like shields than exaltations. ""You come around looking 1984/ You're such a bore, 1984/ Nostalgia, you're using it like a whore""—Brownstein's Orwellian invocation opposes this music with a far more poetic dismissal than ""Fuck Interpol."" Sleater-Kinney's first six records gave a lens through which we might imagine a feminist rewrite of classic rock; <i>The Woods</i> is a front-row seat.</p>
<p>""Jumpers"" was inspired by<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/10/13/jumpers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> a <i>New Yorker</i></a> piece on suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge—""the intensity of feeling that you can't find meaning in your life, so you need to find meaning in your death,"" <a href=""http://www.sfbg.com/39/34/cover_music_the_woods.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brownstein said</a>—which oddly befit the band's decision to end on top. ""Modern Girl"" is Sleater-Kinney's most timeless song, impressionistic as closing one's eyes and staring at the brightest star: ""My whole life was like a picture of a sunny day,"" Brownstein sings, like Sleater-Kinney's ""Yesterday"". But embedded in the soft twinkle is a critique of the consumer culture Sleater-Kinney resisted. (They despised the new proposition of a career-shifting iPod commercial.) The band stopped just as independent music was becoming more financially significant—2004 was the year future indie-Grammy-holders <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a> landed<i>—</i>but traditional notions of integrity were also growing complicated. Brownstein was strangely prophetic: ""I took my money/ And bought me a TV/ TV brings me closer to the world."" This is music you make when you can sense it's one more hour 'til the walls close in.</p>
<p>Little is concrete in rock'n'roll—at the very least, its pivotal moments have often been shrouded in discrepancy and myth. Sister Rosetta Tharpe was the first guitar hero; no, Robert Johnson. Pete Townshend's guitar-smashing was auto-destructive art; no, Townshend's wrecked guitar was privilege. Elvis is dead; Elvis is in Las Vegas. Punk started in London—no, New York—girls started punk rock, not England. But there are unequivocal truths of Sleater-Kinney's career. Objectively, the trio was born of riot grrrl, an underground band that started with two girls together in a living room and became the movement's greatest critical success and so much more: an initial seven-album streak worthy of setting in stone eternal. There is an overcast art-print that accompanies <i>Start Together</i>, set at a weathered race track: Tucker is pounding pavement with a raised fist, Weiss is caught in a fierce skip, and Brownstein, in the middle, has both arms extended skyward, cracking a smile as if she just crushed a marathon. In reality, the band was only just beginning. Sleater-Kinney look invincible there, triumphant even, like superheroes, and if <i>Start Together</i> proves a thing, it is that with passion, persistence, and unwavering purpose, ordinary people can become them.</p></div>"|19860.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19860-sleater-kinney-start-together/|9.3|Jenn Pelly

I am wont to believe Carrie Brownstein when the Sleater-Kinney guitarist, then 21, qualified <a href=""http://meowonline.org/sleater-kinney-riot-grrrl-grows-up/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this 1996 assertion</a> by shrugging it off as a joke. She was, in all likelihood, alluding to the mainstream-affixed mantra of Seattle's blown-up grunge scene, which her own band's roots in the nearby punk-feminist community of Olympia opposed. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/349-bikini-kill/"">Bikini Kill</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"">Fugazi</a> before them, Sleater-Kinney would never succumb to the beckoning of major labels. And in 1996, with their crass punk insurrectionism, the idea of mass success was laughable. Of course, Brownstein's reputation for regional parody on <a href=""http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Portlandia""</a> now precedes her. ""We're never going to be huge like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3272-pearl-jam/"">Pearl Jam</a> or something,"" she said in that interview, ""but I want more people to have access to our music, not just the geeky kids."" Seven years later, in 2003, during the beginnings of the Iraq War, Sleater-Kinney played its <a href=""http://electrip.com/sleater-kinney/1html/showsH/2003shows.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first of many</a> arena-sized gigs—on tour with Pearl Jam.</p>
<p>From 1994 to 2006, Sleater-Kinney seemed to have it all. The trio of Brownstein, singer-guitarist Corin Tucker, and (from '96 on) drummer Janet Weiss created and then fervently revised one of the most distinctive sounds in rock: The friction of their overlapping voices—Brownstein's monotone speak-sing anchoring Tucker's wild vibrato—had an ecstatic, unusual beauty. The expressive longing of Tucker's alone was a gift, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6422-kathleen-hanna/"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hanna</a>'s hardcore holler aspiring to the quasi-operatics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2144-iron-maiden"">Iron Maiden</a>'s Bruce Dickinson. Tucker is perhaps the first punk singer to attempt such a thing while worshipping the enormity of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6279-aretha-franklin/"" target=""_blank"">Aretha Franklin</a>, channeling lessons from the Queen of Soul into her own singing, holding onto moments for dear life and then projecting them to the heavens, becoming <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTHpfZhfQbk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Queen of Rock</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, Sleater-Kinney were humble, imageless indie-rockers; in song, they demanded icon status. This streamlined set, <i>Start Together</i>, captures that dichotomy, archiving the Sleater-Kinney canon with care: from the ideological-punches of thirdwave feminism to their post-riot grrrl classic rock revisionism, all seven albums have been remastered and paired with a plainly gorgeous hardcover photobook, as well as the surprise of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17172-sleater-kinney-bury-our-friends/"" target=""_blank"">reunion-launching 7"" single</a>.

Sleater-Kinney released their next four records with the larger Olympia feminist label, <a href=""http://www.killrockstars.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kill Rock Stars</a>, but none distilled the band's sound and attitude like <i>Dig Me Out</i>: sometimes brutal heartache, sometimes a menacing threat, always intelligent and extreme, there are enough hooks architected into these two- and three-minute songs to span several albums, but even the added dum-de-dum sugar seems as though it must be raw Portland agave.</p>
<p>""Little Babies"" critiques stereotypes of motherhood, ""Heart Factory"" roars over synthetic emotions of the <i>Prozac Nation</i>, and the instantly classic ""Words and Guitar"" is an ode to rock that just feels necessary. At the peak of ""The Drama You've Been Craving""—Tucker's ""Kick it <i>OUT!</i>""—there are practically fireworks bursting on either side. Really, <i>Dig</i> goes from 0-to-100 within seconds of its opening salvo of a title track, which begs for transcendence from worldly oppression, ""Outta this mess/ Outta my head."" Unlike so much in the trajectory of punk, there is no nihilistic self-destruction in the face of chaos. More than skepticism, anti-consumerism, or the glories of tattoo art, punk teaches empathy, a principle Sleater-Kinney practiced with nuance. This is why Sleater-Kinney's music shines a light despite its loudness, why it is easy to be alone with the songs and feel protected. Sleater-Kinney would never forego the optimism to believe their songbook could make us smarter, angrier, more tender and hopeful. <i>Dig Me Out </i>dreams of a better future, clawing itself up with every note.</p>
<p>The highlight of <i>Dig Me Out</i> and Sleater-Kinney's career, ""One More Hour"" is one of the most devastating break-up songs in rock. ""Oh, you've got the darkest eyes,"" Tucker and Brownstein quaver in unison—the song is about their own short-lived romance—and the way Tucker extends the last word, it is like she can't let them go. There are complex feelings near clear ones, which is what break-ups are: someone wants to untangle the mess, someone wants to snip it apart. ""I needed it,"" Tucker howls, hardly distinguishing where one word ends and another begins. ""One More Hour"" is sublime sadness, a kind one can only know when staring at the end of something and wanting desperately for it not to be so. </p>
<p>This feeling would root 1999's atmospheric <b><i>The Hot Rock</i></b>: subdued and spiritual, it served a number of firsts for Sleater-Kinney, among them a slot on the Billboard charts (at 181). Tucker, Brownstein, and Weiss had never sounded so introspective, existential, and dark, so aesthetically poetic and conventionally pretty. The album's interlocking parts were influenced by the gentle alterna-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1737-the-go-betweens/"">Go-Betweens</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a>; voices intertwine gracefully, as if braiding together dreams and wounds. It's the Sleater-Kinney record you're most likely to play on a train while gazing out the window and getting lost in thought.</p>
<p>Brownstein and Tucker sang of personal becoming, the uncertainties of adulthood, dying relationships and technological paranoia—it was, after all, the year before tin-foil Y2K Bugs would signal the end civilization—sometimes with abstract metaphors. The jaw-dropping despair of Brownstein's wearied ballad ""The Size of Our Love"" has a lonely ambience, a love-story plaintively set between hospital walls: ""The ring on my finger/ So tight it turns blue,"" she sings over a crying viola. ""A constant reminder/ I'll die in this room/ If you die in this room."" It's unsurprising that Brownstein has since catapulted her storylines to a mass scale: Comedians are professionals at manipulating our emotions, and if it is one's intention to make people laugh, it must help to have mastered the ability to make them cry.</p>
<p>The sun, ocean, and cosmos build the imagistic single, ""Get Up"". A staccato riff quilts the emphatic drumming, and the guitar tones are magic—had the band not called those natural elements out, it's evident that ""Get Up"" absorbed their expanses. Tucker's hovering speak-sing evokes Kim Gordon beaming down from an imagined heaven on Sonic Youth's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reSOp1domrU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tunic (Song for Karen)""</a>. Echoing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3842-patti-smith/"">Patti Smith</a> as well, Tucker's words fly into the air as if given wings—""Goodbye small hands/ Goodbye small heart/ Goodbye small head""—zen-like as she watches her body go, ""like a whole bucket of stars dumped into the universe."" Sleater-Kinney didn't necessarily follow their '60s rock predecessors into ashram training, but this reflects the Eastern belief that when you die, you become a part of nature. Tucker works through primal desires—""Do you think I'm an animal? Am I not?""—and despite the textured makeover, <i>The Hot Rock</i> emerges as one of Sleater-Kinney's heaviest records.</p>
<p>Swinging back to capital-R Rock, 2000's <b><i>All Hands on the Bad One</i></b> was Sleater-Kinney's most straight-ahead arbiter of thirdwave feminism and also, surprisingly, their most jovial record. Sing-song guitar-pop turned up alongside plainspoken take-downs of sexism in music, and hints of new wave, girl-groups and Go-Gos mixed (cohesively, too) with some of their hardest whiplash-rippers. The enormously hooky ""You're No Rock n' Roll Fun"" taunts dry girl-averse indie snobs: ""You're no rock'n'roll fun/ Like a piece of art that no one can touch!"" the trio sang together, throwing ""whiskey drinks and chocolate bars"" at these guys to shake up the mood, 'cause why not? When Sleater-Kinney note how ""the best man won't hang out with the girl BAA-AAND!"" we're only left wondering why he'd pass on such fun.</p>
<p>Similar humor plays out on ""Milkshake n' Honey"", a <i>Spinal Tap</i>-esque wink at the debauched rocker/groupie complex, but the incisive messages make the best songs: ""The Professional"" uses charged surf-punk to condemn the marginalizing of women in music, ""Male Model"" dismantles the sexist canon and rejects investigations of women's authenticity. A lyrics sheet proves <i>Bad One</i> is Sleater-Kinney's most direct sloganeering, but it doesn't come off as such; Tucker's ferocity and Brownstein's French-sung interjections make it cool, even. ""#1 Must Have"" is the centerpiece, in which Tucker dissects the commodification of riot grrrl and—in light of the rapes at Woodstock in '99—powerfully asserts, ""The number one must-have/ Is that we are safe."" The song's lasting relevance can't be overstated.</p>
<p>The world was irreversibly changed by the time of 2002's <b><i>One Beat</i></b>, Sleater-Kinney's weightiest record. Adventuring with math rock and stomping horns, it was their most explicitly political album, grappling with the aftermath of 9/11 on ""Far Away"" and ""Combat Rock"". These songs reflected the national headspace as selflessly as any act of using someone's tragedy for art allows. Tucker questioned the all-or-nothing patriotism sweeping the U.S., and detailed her own experience that day with raw catharsis, calling-out the hidden President Bush, honoring those who served, and striving for a glimmer of kindness: ""I look to the sky/ And ask it not to rain."" <i>One Beat </i>was not all war songs—the bouncy organ-led love-anthem ""Oh!"" had glammy inflections, ""Prisstina"" chronicled an outcast's discovery of rock. The closer, ""Sympathy"", rips instrumentation from ""Sympathy for the Devil"" but inverts its theme, a prayer for the life of Tucker's premature-born child: ""There is no righteousness in your darkest moment,"" Tucker belts, ""We're all equal in the face of what we're most afraid.""</p>
<p>Even the scope of <i>One Beat</i> couldn't predict Sleater-Kinney's monstrous phase-one farewell, 2005's <b><i>The Woods</i></b><i>. </i>The band's appeal had become that of the indie rock mainstream, and a suburban high-schooler (such as myself, then) could readily learn of <i>The Woods</i>' greatness from the same weirdo dude-friends who repped new CDs by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"">the White Stripes</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a> (like I did). Sleater-Kinney had just played arenas with Pearl Jam, bending notes into heavier, looser sounds, when they journeyed upstate New York to track <i>The Woods</i> with producer David Fridmann, himself only two years removed from helping turn Flaming Lips' 2002 opus <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3081-yoshimi-battles-the-pink-robots/"">Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</a> </i>into a wider breakout.</p>
<p>When your best work is also your most uncompromising and unintelligible, you have accomplished a considerable artistic feat—this was the <i>The Woods</i>. It was tracked live with more distortion than usual, giving it a freneticism, a deranged euphoria. ""[Friddman would] say things to Janet like, 'Play like Keith Moon, but Keith Moon with a blanket coming down over him,'"" Tucker <a href=""http://www.sfbg.com/39/34/cover_music_the_woods.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. That possessed orchestra-of-rhythm translated. The album's heaving 11-minute mega-solo, ""Let's Call It Love"", and the soulful echo ""Night Light"", comprise a grandiose jam colored in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12181-deep-purple/"" target=""_blank"">Deep Purple</a>. Zep riffs abound. ""Entertain"" is an atypical military march, declaring war on hollow retro rock; its ""woah-oh-ohs"" are more like shields than exaltations. ""You come around looking 1984/ You're such a bore, 1984/ Nostalgia, you're using it like a whore""—Brownstein's Orwellian invocation opposes this music with a far more poetic dismissal than ""Fuck Interpol."" Sleater-Kinney's first six records gave a lens through which we might imagine a feminist rewrite of classic rock; <i>The Woods</i> is a front-row seat.</p>
<p>""Jumpers"" was inspired by<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/10/13/jumpers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> a <i>New Yorker</i></a> piece on suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge—""the intensity of feeling that you can't find meaning in your life, so you need to find meaning in your death,"" <a href=""http://www.sfbg.com/39/34/cover_music_the_woods.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brownstein said</a>—which oddly befit the band's decision to end on top. ""Modern Girl"" is Sleater-Kinney's most timeless song, impressionistic as closing one's eyes and staring at the brightest star: ""My whole life was like a picture of a sunny day,"" Brownstein sings, like Sleater-Kinney's ""Yesterday"". But embedded in the soft twinkle is a critique of the consumer culture Sleater-Kinney resisted. (They despised the new proposition of a career-shifting iPod commercial.) The band stopped just as independent music was becoming more financially significant—2004 was the year future indie-Grammy-holders <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a> landed<i>—</i>but traditional notions of integrity were also growing complicated. Brownstein was strangely prophetic: ""I took my money/ And bought me a TV/ TV brings me closer to the world."" This is music you make when you can sense it's one more hour 'til the walls close in.</p>
<p>Little is concrete in rock'n'roll—at the very least, its pivotal moments have often been shrouded in discrepancy and myth. Sister Rosetta Tharpe was the first guitar hero; no, Robert Johnson. Pete Townshend's guitar-smashing was auto-destructive art; no, Townshend's wrecked guitar was privilege. Elvis is dead; Elvis is in Las Vegas. Punk started in London—no, New York—girls started punk rock, not England. But there are unequivocal truths of Sleater-Kinney's career. Objectively, the trio was born of riot grrrl, an underground band that started with two girls together in a living room and became the movement's greatest critical success and so much more: an initial seven-album streak worthy of setting in stone eternal. There is an overcast art-print that accompanies <i>Start Together</i>, set at a weathered race track: Tucker is pounding pavement with a raised fist, Weiss is caught in a fierce skip, and Brownstein, in the middle, has both arms extended skyward, cracking a smile as if she just crushed a marathon. In reality, the band was only just beginning. Sleater-Kinney look invincible there, triumphant even, like superheroes, and if <i>Start Together</i> proves a thing, it is that with passion, persistence, and unwavering purpose, ordinary people can become them.</p></div>"|19860.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19860-sleater-kinney-start-together/|8.8|Jenn Pelly

I am wont to believe Carrie Brownstein when the Sleater-Kinney guitarist, then 21, qualified <a href=""http://meowonline.org/sleater-kinney-riot-grrrl-grows-up/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this 1996 assertion</a> by shrugging it off as a joke. She was, in all likelihood, alluding to the mainstream-affixed mantra of Seattle's blown-up grunge scene, which her own band's roots in the nearby punk-feminist community of Olympia opposed. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/349-bikini-kill/"">Bikini Kill</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"">Fugazi</a> before them, Sleater-Kinney would never succumb to the beckoning of major labels. And in 1996, with their crass punk insurrectionism, the idea of mass success was laughable. Of course, Brownstein's reputation for regional parody on <a href=""http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Portlandia""</a> now precedes her. ""We're never going to be huge like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3272-pearl-jam/"">Pearl Jam</a> or something,"" she said in that interview, ""but I want more people to have access to our music, not just the geeky kids."" Seven years later, in 2003, during the beginnings of the Iraq War, Sleater-Kinney played its <a href=""http://electrip.com/sleater-kinney/1html/showsH/2003shows.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first of many</a> arena-sized gigs—on tour with Pearl Jam.</p>
<p>From 1994 to 2006, Sleater-Kinney seemed to have it all. The trio of Brownstein, singer-guitarist Corin Tucker, and (from '96 on) drummer Janet Weiss created and then fervently revised one of the most distinctive sounds in rock: The friction of their overlapping voices—Brownstein's monotone speak-sing anchoring Tucker's wild vibrato—had an ecstatic, unusual beauty. The expressive longing of Tucker's alone was a gift, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6422-kathleen-hanna/"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hanna</a>'s hardcore holler aspiring to the quasi-operatics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2144-iron-maiden"">Iron Maiden</a>'s Bruce Dickinson. Tucker is perhaps the first punk singer to attempt such a thing while worshipping the enormity of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6279-aretha-franklin/"" target=""_blank"">Aretha Franklin</a>, channeling lessons from the Queen of Soul into her own singing, holding onto moments for dear life and then projecting them to the heavens, becoming <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTHpfZhfQbk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Queen of Rock</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, Sleater-Kinney were humble, imageless indie-rockers; in song, they demanded icon status. This streamlined set, <i>Start Together</i>, captures that dichotomy, archiving the Sleater-Kinney canon with care: from the ideological-punches of thirdwave feminism to their post-riot grrrl classic rock revisionism, all seven albums have been remastered and paired with a plainly gorgeous hardcover photobook, as well as the surprise of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17172-sleater-kinney-bury-our-friends/"" target=""_blank"">reunion-launching 7"" single</a>. In all, <i>Start Together</i> tells the unlikely story of how this band carried the wildfire of '90s Oly-punk to pastures of more ambitious musicality—a decade that moves from caterwauling shrieks to glowing lyricism, from barebones snark to Zep-length improv, from personal-political to outright (left) political.</p>
<p>Sleater-Kinney was consciously <i>about</i> rock'n'roll. Lou Reed sang for Jenny whose life was saved by rock; Ramones told us how Sheena became a punk. In 1994 there was no shortage of women plugging in—newly born classics included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6162-hole/"">Hole</a>'s <i>Live Through This</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair/"">Liz Phair</a>'s <i>Exile in Guyville</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"">PJ Harvey</a>'s <i>Rid of Me</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"">the Breeders</a>' <i>Last Splash—</i>but the lineage of larger-than-life stars, the deified behind-the-head-shredders, still had few instances of women delivering rock-as-saviour meta-narratives themselves. Sleater-Kinney turned the machismo of hippie-blooded '60s and '70s rock on its head: covers of Springsteen and CCR, homages to Kinks and the Clash, Brownstein's Pete Townshend windmills and shin-kicking swagger, Tucker's defiant declaration that ""I make rock'n'roll!"" A life-or-death seriousness is omnipresent with Sleater-Kinney, but they never rejected rock's base desires—sex, dancing, proverbial milkshakes—although sometimes they vaguely mocked them. Sleater-Kinney stole from men what men had in turn stolen from the margins: electrified blues that all still made girls scream.</p>
<p>The first Sleater-Kinney practice was in March of 1994. It was the spring that Kurt Cobain died. Hindsight paints it clear: Cobain's desire for a future-rock made by women dispersed into the universe. Brownstein and Tucker did Sleater-Kinney as a side-project to their respective bands, the queercore power-chord screams of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1FX46vIY88"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Excuse 17</a> and soul-baring punk of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v_bw-8adTU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heavens to Betsy</a>. Sleater-Kinney fused these politicized sounds, but as they grew—with affection for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/264-the-b-52s/"">B-52's</a> shimmy and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> cool—they never let the punk rulebook limit their vision. Riot grrrl was fragmenting and they learned from its successes and failures—a radical streak pervaded their writerly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8693-husker-du/"">Hüsker Dü</a>-type storytelling—but they also fought to not be removed from the context of their foundation. The wiry blast of 1995's <b><i>Sleater-Kinney</i></b> is as good an indicator of Bikini Kill's influence as any feminist album since, echoing their sound as well as an interest in making punk become activism.</p>
<p>The debut is foremost a rejection of heteronormative sex, as Tucker and Brownstein were reckoning with life inside their bodies as women who approached sexuality fluidly. There's a song about how much sucking dick sucks, called ""How to Play Dead""—it began Sleater-Kinney's mission of showing how society can silence women and minimize their problems. The urgency is real; all of <i>Sleater-Kinney</i> was scrappily-recorded in one night, on a trip to Australia, where they enlisted drummer Lora MacFarlane, who also kept-time on 1996's <i>Call the Doctor</i>. ""A Real Man"" is like an incendiary take on classic feminist text <i>The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm</i>: ""Don't you wanna feel it inside/ They say that it feels so nice,"" Tucker gasps with visceral sarcasm. Call it clit-rock, I guess; over hard-style riffs, Tucker makes it clear she won't wait ""to cum every time."" Amid this whirlwind of pleasure and pain, which occasionally veers towards emo, Brownstein and Tucker's whispers erupt on ""The Day I Went Away"", one of two wistful songs that foreshadow Sleater-Kinney's impending greatness.</p>
<p>Sleater-Kinney continued feeding its appetite for destruction of archetypes on 1996's <b><i>Call the Doctor</i></b>. It improved their raw punk convictions in every way: more complex guitarwork, more distortion to intellectualize, more aggression and profound sadness. ""Why do good things never wanna stay?"" Tucker asks on ""Good Things"", an earnest stomach-twister of a teardrop tune, while the dire ""Anonymous"" wonders why its female protagonist is voluntarily unspoken. ""I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone"" uses tradition to infiltrate and subvert—the riff could be Ramones pushing Stooges' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIqnXTqg8I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Wanna Be Your Dog""</a> into the red—to cleverly protest the worship of male icons and spur revolution: ""I wanna be your Joey Ramone/ Pictures of me on your bedroom door/ Invite you back after the show/ I'm the queen of rock and roll."" It's a two-and-half-minute rock'n'roll joyride deserving of a gender studies thesis.</p>
<p>Tucker's fierce and vulnerable depictions of unconventional love marked the title track, where the dueling vocals first exploded. ""It felt like something had opened up,"" Brownstein told <a href=""http://owsk.ms11.net/articles/rsarticle.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rolling Stone</i></a>. ""We just stopped. And [Corin] was like, ‘This is so awesome, you have to keep doing that.’ It felt like I had fused with her. This bolt of lightning had gone from my chest to hers."" <i>Call the Doctor</i> landed at number three on <i>The Village Voice</i>’s then-influential critic’s poll. Their label, Chainsaw, couldn’t press copies fast enough.</p>
<p>Then, behold: Janet Weiss. She joined on 1997's breakneck <b><i>Dig Me Out</i></b>, an all-time great American punk statement, giving Sleater-Kinney the most crucial muscle a drummer can offer: not sheer force, but heart, taking the momentum to a new plane. Sleater-Kinney released their next four records with the larger Olympia feminist label, <a href=""http://www.killrockstars.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kill Rock Stars</a>, but none distilled the band's sound and attitude like <i>Dig Me Out</i>: sometimes brutal heartache, sometimes a menacing threat, always intelligent and extreme, there are enough hooks architected into these two- and three-minute songs to span several albums, but even the added dum-de-dum sugar seems as though it must be raw Portland agave.</p>
<p>""Little Babies"" critiques stereotypes of motherhood, ""Heart Factory"" roars over synthetic emotions of the <i>Prozac Nation</i>, and the instantly classic ""Words and Guitar"" is an ode to rock that just feels necessary. At the peak of ""The Drama You've Been Craving""—Tucker's ""Kick it <i>OUT!</i>""—there are practically fireworks bursting on either side. Really, <i>Dig</i> goes from 0-to-100 within seconds of its opening salvo of a title track, which begs for transcendence from worldly oppression, ""Outta this mess/ Outta my head."" Unlike so much in the trajectory of punk, there is no nihilistic self-destruction in the face of chaos. More than skepticism, anti-consumerism, or the glories of tattoo art, punk teaches empathy, a principle Sleater-Kinney practiced with nuance. This is why Sleater-Kinney's music shines a light despite its loudness, why it is easy to be alone with the songs and feel protected. Sleater-Kinney would never forego the optimism to believe their songbook could make us smarter, angrier, more tender and hopeful. <i>Dig Me Out </i>dreams of a better future, clawing itself up with every note.</p>
<p>The highlight of <i>Dig Me Out</i> and Sleater-Kinney's career, ""One More Hour"" is one of the most devastating break-up songs in rock. ""Oh, you've got the darkest eyes,"" Tucker and Brownstein quaver in unison—the song is about their own short-lived romance—and the way Tucker extends the last word, it is like she can't let them go. There are complex feelings near clear ones, which is what break-ups are: someone wants to untangle the mess, someone wants to snip it apart. ""I needed it,"" Tucker howls, hardly distinguishing where one word ends and another begins. ""One More Hour"" is sublime sadness, a kind one can only know when staring at the end of something and wanting desperately for it not to be so. </p>

It's the Sleater-Kinney record you're most likely to play on a train while gazing out the window and getting lost in thought.</p>
<p>Brownstein and Tucker sang of personal becoming, the uncertainties of adulthood, dying relationships and technological paranoia—it was, after all, the year before tin-foil Y2K Bugs would signal the end civilization—sometimes with abstract metaphors. The jaw-dropping despair of Brownstein's wearied ballad ""The Size of Our Love"" has a lonely ambience, a love-story plaintively set between hospital walls: ""The ring on my finger/ So tight it turns blue,"" she sings over a crying viola. ""A constant reminder/ I'll die in this room/ If you die in this room."" It's unsurprising that Brownstein has since catapulted her storylines to a mass scale: Comedians are professionals at manipulating our emotions, and if it is one's intention to make people laugh, it must help to have mastered the ability to make them cry.</p>
<p>The sun, ocean, and cosmos build the imagistic single, ""Get Up"". A staccato riff quilts the emphatic drumming, and the guitar tones are magic—had the band not called those natural elements out, it's evident that ""Get Up"" absorbed their expanses. Tucker's hovering speak-sing evokes Kim Gordon beaming down from an imagined heaven on Sonic Youth's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reSOp1domrU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tunic (Song for Karen)""</a>.

Adventuring with math rock and stomping horns, it was their most explicitly political album, grappling with the aftermath of 9/11 on ""Far Away"" and ""Combat Rock"". These songs reflected the national headspace as selflessly as any act of using someone's tragedy for art allows. Tucker questioned the all-or-nothing patriotism sweeping the U.S., and detailed her own experience that day with raw catharsis, calling-out the hidden President Bush, honoring those who served, and striving for a glimmer of kindness: ""I look to the sky/ And ask it not to rain."" <i>One Beat </i>was not all war songs—the bouncy organ-led love-anthem ""Oh!"" had glammy inflections, ""Prisstina"" chronicled an outcast's discovery of rock. The closer, ""Sympathy"", rips instrumentation from ""Sympathy for the Devil"" but inverts its theme, a prayer for the life of Tucker's premature-born child: ""There is no righteousness in your darkest moment,"" Tucker belts, ""We're all equal in the face of what we're most afraid.""</p>
<p>Even the scope of <i>One Beat</i> couldn't predict Sleater-Kinney's monstrous phase-one farewell, 2005's <b><i>The Woods</i></b><i>. </i>The band's appeal had become that of the indie rock mainstream, and a suburban high-schooler (such as myself, then) could readily learn of <i>The Woods</i>' greatness from the same weirdo dude-friends who repped new CDs by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"">the White Stripes</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a> (like I did). Sleater-Kinney had just played arenas with Pearl Jam, bending notes into heavier, looser sounds, when they journeyed upstate New York to track <i>The Woods</i> with producer David Fridmann, himself only two years removed from helping turn Flaming Lips' 2002 opus <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3081-yoshimi-battles-the-pink-robots/"">Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</a> </i>into a wider breakout.</p>
<p>When your best work is also your most uncompromising and unintelligible, you have accomplished a considerable artistic feat—this was the <i>The Woods</i>. It was tracked live with more distortion than usual, giving it a freneticism, a deranged euphoria. ""[Friddman would] say things to Janet like, 'Play like Keith Moon, but Keith Moon with a blanket coming down over him,'"" Tucker <a href=""http://www.sfbg.com/39/34/cover_music_the_woods.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. That possessed orchestra-of-rhythm translated. The album's heaving 11-minute mega-solo, ""Let's Call It Love"", and the soulful echo ""Night Light"", comprise a grandiose jam colored in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12181-deep-purple/"" target=""_blank"">Deep Purple</a>. Zep riffs abound. ""Entertain"" is an atypical military march, declaring war on hollow retro rock; its ""woah-oh-ohs"" are more like shields than exaltations. ""You come around looking 1984/ You're such a bore, 1984/ Nostalgia, you're using it like a whore""—Brownstein's Orwellian invocation opposes this music with a far more poetic dismissal than ""Fuck Interpol."" Sleater-Kinney's first six records gave a lens through which we might imagine a feminist rewrite of classic rock; <i>The Woods</i> is a front-row seat.</p>
<p>""Jumpers"" was inspired by<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/10/13/jumpers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> a <i>New Yorker</i></a> piece on suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge—""the intensity of feeling that you can't find meaning in your life, so you need to find meaning in your death,"" <a href=""http://www.sfbg.com/39/34/cover_music_the_woods.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brownstein said</a>—which oddly befit the band's decision to end on top. ""Modern Girl"" is Sleater-Kinney's most timeless song, impressionistic as closing one's eyes and staring at the brightest star: ""My whole life was like a picture of a sunny day,"" Brownstein sings, like Sleater-Kinney's ""Yesterday"". But embedded in the soft twinkle is a critique of the consumer culture Sleater-Kinney resisted. (They despised the new proposition of a career-shifting iPod commercial.) The band stopped just as independent music was becoming more financially significant—2004 was the year future indie-Grammy-holders <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a> landed<i>—</i>but traditional notions of integrity were also growing complicated. Brownstein was strangely prophetic: ""I took my money/ And bought me a TV/ TV brings me closer to the world."" This is music you make when you can sense it's one more hour 'til the walls close in.</p>
<p>Little is concrete in rock'n'roll—at the very least, its pivotal moments have often been shrouded in discrepancy and myth. Sister Rosetta Tharpe was the first guitar hero; no, Robert Johnson. Pete Townshend's guitar-smashing was auto-destructive art; no, Townshend's wrecked guitar was privilege. Elvis is dead; Elvis is in Las Vegas. Punk started in London—no, New York—girls started punk rock, not England. But there are unequivocal truths of Sleater-Kinney's career. Objectively, the trio was born of riot grrrl, an underground band that started with two girls together in a living room and became the movement's greatest critical success and so much more: an initial seven-album streak worthy of setting in stone eternal. There is an overcast art-print that accompanies <i>Start Together</i>, set at a weathered race track: Tucker is pounding pavement with a raised fist, Weiss is caught in a fierce skip, and Brownstein, in the middle, has both arms extended skyward, cracking a smile as if she just crushed a marathon. In reality, the band was only just beginning. Sleater-Kinney look invincible there, triumphant even, like superheroes, and if <i>Start Together</i> proves a thing, it is that with passion, persistence, and unwavering purpose, ordinary people can become them.</p></div>"|19860.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19860-sleater-kinney-start-together/|8.5|Jenn Pelly

I am wont to believe Carrie Brownstein when the Sleater-Kinney guitarist, then 21, qualified <a href=""http://meowonline.org/sleater-kinney-riot-grrrl-grows-up/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this 1996 assertion</a> by shrugging it off as a joke. She was, in all likelihood, alluding to the mainstream-affixed mantra of Seattle's blown-up grunge scene, which her own band's roots in the nearby punk-feminist community of Olympia opposed. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/349-bikini-kill/"">Bikini Kill</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"">Fugazi</a> before them, Sleater-Kinney would never succumb to the beckoning of major labels. And in 1996, with their crass punk insurrectionism, the idea of mass success was laughable. Of course, Brownstein's reputation for regional parody on <a href=""http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Portlandia""</a> now precedes her. ""We're never going to be huge like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3272-pearl-jam/"">Pearl Jam</a> or something,"" she said in that interview, ""but I want more people to have access to our music, not just the geeky kids."" Seven years later, in 2003, during the beginnings of the Iraq War, Sleater-Kinney played its <a href=""http://electrip.com/sleater-kinney/1html/showsH/2003shows.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first of many</a> arena-sized gigs—on tour with Pearl Jam.</p>
<p>From 1994 to 2006, Sleater-Kinney seemed to have it all. The trio of Brownstein, singer-guitarist Corin Tucker, and (from '96 on) drummer Janet Weiss created and then fervently revised one of the most distinctive sounds in rock: The friction of their overlapping voices—Brownstein's monotone speak-sing anchoring Tucker's wild vibrato—had an ecstatic, unusual beauty. The expressive longing of Tucker's alone was a gift, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6422-kathleen-hanna/"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hanna</a>'s hardcore holler aspiring to the quasi-operatics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2144-iron-maiden"">Iron Maiden</a>'s Bruce Dickinson. Tucker is perhaps the first punk singer to attempt such a thing while worshipping the enormity of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6279-aretha-franklin/"" target=""_blank"">Aretha Franklin</a>, channeling lessons from the Queen of Soul into her own singing, holding onto moments for dear life and then projecting them to the heavens, becoming <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTHpfZhfQbk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Queen of Rock</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, Sleater-Kinney were humble, imageless indie-rockers; in song, they demanded icon status. This streamlined set, <i>Start Together</i>, captures that dichotomy, archiving the Sleater-Kinney canon with care: from the ideological-punches of thirdwave feminism to their post-riot grrrl classic rock revisionism, all seven albums have been remastered and paired with a plainly gorgeous hardcover photobook, as well as the surprise of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17172-sleater-kinney-bury-our-friends/"" target=""_blank"">reunion-launching 7"" single</a>. In all, <i>Start Together</i> tells the unlikely story of how this band carried the wildfire of '90s Oly-punk to pastures of more ambitious musicality—a decade that moves from caterwauling shrieks to glowing lyricism, from barebones snark to Zep-length improv, from personal-political to outright (left) political.</p>
<p>Sleater-Kinney was consciously <i>about</i> rock'n'roll. Lou Reed sang for Jenny whose life was saved by rock; Ramones told us how Sheena became a punk. In 1994 there was no shortage of women plugging in—newly born classics included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6162-hole/"">Hole</a>'s <i>Live Through This</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair/"">Liz Phair</a>'s <i>Exile in Guyville</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"">PJ Harvey</a>'s <i>Rid of Me</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"">the Breeders</a>' <i>Last Splash—</i>but the lineage of larger-than-life stars, the deified behind-the-head-shredders, still had few instances of women delivering rock-as-saviour meta-narratives themselves. Sleater-Kinney turned the machismo of hippie-blooded '60s and '70s rock on its head: covers of Springsteen and CCR, homages to Kinks and the Clash, Brownstein's Pete Townshend windmills and shin-kicking swagger, Tucker's defiant declaration that ""I make rock'n'roll!"" A life-or-death seriousness is omnipresent with Sleater-Kinney, but they never rejected rock's base desires—sex, dancing, proverbial milkshakes—although sometimes they vaguely mocked them. Sleater-Kinney stole from men what men had in turn stolen from the margins: electrified blues that all still made girls scream.</p>
<p>The first Sleater-Kinney practice was in March of 1994. It was the spring that Kurt Cobain died. Hindsight paints it clear: Cobain's desire for a future-rock made by women dispersed into the universe. Brownstein and Tucker did Sleater-Kinney as a side-project to their respective bands, the queercore power-chord screams of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1FX46vIY88"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Excuse 17</a> and soul-baring punk of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v_bw-8adTU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heavens to Betsy</a>. Sleater-Kinney fused these politicized sounds, but as they grew—with affection for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/264-the-b-52s/"">B-52's</a> shimmy and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> cool—they never let the punk rulebook limit their vision. Riot grrrl was fragmenting and they learned from its successes and failures—a radical streak pervaded their writerly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8693-husker-du/"">Hüsker Dü</a>-type storytelling—but they also fought to not be removed from the context of their foundation. The wiry blast of 1995's <b><i>Sleater-Kinney</i></b> is as good an indicator of Bikini Kill's influence as any feminist album since, echoing their sound as well as an interest in making punk become activism.</p>
<p>The debut is foremost a rejection of heteronormative sex, as Tucker and Brownstein were reckoning with life inside their bodies as women who approached sexuality fluidly. There's a song about how much sucking dick sucks, called ""How to Play Dead""—it began Sleater-Kinney's mission of showing how society can silence women and minimize their problems. The urgency is real; all of <i>Sleater-Kinney</i> was scrappily-recorded in one night, on a trip to Australia, where they enlisted drummer Lora MacFarlane, who also kept-time on 1996's <i>Call the Doctor</i>. ""A Real Man"" is like an incendiary take on classic feminist text <i>The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm</i>: ""Don't you wanna feel it inside/ They say that it feels so nice,"" Tucker gasps with visceral sarcasm. Call it clit-rock, I guess; over hard-style riffs, Tucker makes it clear she won't wait ""to cum every time."" Amid this whirlwind of pleasure and pain, which occasionally veers towards emo, Brownstein and Tucker's whispers erupt on ""The Day I Went Away"", one of two wistful songs that foreshadow Sleater-Kinney's impending greatness.</p>
<p>Sleater-Kinney continued feeding its appetite for destruction of archetypes on 1996's <b><i>Call the Doctor</i></b>. It improved their raw punk convictions in every way: more complex guitarwork, more distortion to intellectualize, more aggression and profound sadness. ""Why do good things never wanna stay?"" Tucker asks on ""Good Things"", an earnest stomach-twister of a teardrop tune, while the dire ""Anonymous"" wonders why its female protagonist is voluntarily unspoken. ""I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone"" uses tradition to infiltrate and subvert—the riff could be Ramones pushing Stooges' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIqnXTqg8I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Wanna Be Your Dog""</a> into the red—to cleverly protest the worship of male icons and spur revolution: ""I wanna be your Joey Ramone/ Pictures of me on your bedroom door/ Invite you back after the show/ I'm the queen of rock and roll."" It's a two-and-half-minute rock'n'roll joyride deserving of a gender studies thesis.</p>
<p>Tucker's fierce and vulnerable depictions of unconventional love marked the title track, where the dueling vocals first exploded. ""It felt like something had opened up,"" Brownstein told <a href=""http://owsk.ms11.net/articles/rsarticle.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rolling Stone</i></a>. ""We just stopped. And [Corin] was like, ‘This is so awesome, you have to keep doing that.’ It felt like I had fused with her. This bolt of lightning had gone from my chest to hers."" <i>Call the Doctor</i> landed at number three on <i>The Village Voice</i>’s then-influential critic’s poll. Their label, Chainsaw, couldn’t press copies fast enough.</p>
<p>Then, behold: Janet Weiss. She joined on 1997's breakneck <b><i>Dig Me Out</i></b>, an all-time great American punk statement, giving Sleater-Kinney the most crucial muscle a drummer can offer: not sheer force, but heart, taking the momentum to a new plane. Sleater-Kinney released their next four records with the larger Olympia feminist label, <a href=""http://www.killrockstars.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kill Rock Stars</a>, but none distilled the band's sound and attitude like <i>Dig Me Out</i>: sometimes brutal heartache, sometimes a menacing threat, always intelligent and extreme, there are enough hooks architected into these two- and three-minute songs to span several albums, but even the added dum-de-dum sugar seems as though it must be raw Portland agave.</p>
<p>""Little Babies"" critiques stereotypes of motherhood, ""Heart Factory"" roars over synthetic emotions of the <i>Prozac Nation</i>, and the instantly classic ""Words and Guitar"" is an ode to rock that just feels necessary. At the peak of ""The Drama You've Been Craving""—Tucker's ""Kick it <i>OUT!</i>""—there are practically fireworks bursting on either side. Really, <i>Dig</i> goes from 0-to-100 within seconds of its opening salvo of a title track, which begs for transcendence from worldly oppression, ""Outta this mess/ Outta my head."" Unlike so much in the trajectory of punk, there is no nihilistic self-destruction in the face of chaos. More than skepticism, anti-consumerism, or the glories of tattoo art, punk teaches empathy, a principle Sleater-Kinney practiced with nuance. This is why Sleater-Kinney's music shines a light despite its loudness, why it is easy to be alone with the songs and feel protected. Sleater-Kinney would never forego the optimism to believe their songbook could make us smarter, angrier, more tender and hopeful. <i>Dig Me Out </i>dreams of a better future, clawing itself up with every note.</p>
<p>The highlight of <i>Dig Me Out</i> and Sleater-Kinney's career, ""One More Hour"" is one of the most devastating break-up songs in rock. ""Oh, you've got the darkest eyes,"" Tucker and Brownstein quaver in unison—the song is about their own short-lived romance—and the way Tucker extends the last word, it is like she can't let them go. There are complex feelings near clear ones, which is what break-ups are: someone wants to untangle the mess, someone wants to snip it apart. ""I needed it,"" Tucker howls, hardly distinguishing where one word ends and another begins. ""One More Hour"" is sublime sadness, a kind one can only know when staring at the end of something and wanting desperately for it not to be so. </p>
<p>This feeling would root 1999's atmospheric <b><i>The Hot Rock</i></b>: subdued and spiritual, it served a number of firsts for Sleater-Kinney, among them a slot on the Billboard charts (at 181). Tucker, Brownstein, and Weiss had never sounded so introspective, existential, and dark, so aesthetically poetic and conventionally pretty. The album's interlocking parts were influenced by the gentle alterna-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1737-the-go-betweens/"">Go-Betweens</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a>; voices intertwine gracefully, as if braiding together dreams and wounds. It's the Sleater-Kinney record you're most likely to play on a train while gazing out the window and getting lost in thought.</p>
<p>Brownstein and Tucker sang of personal becoming, the uncertainties of adulthood, dying relationships and technological paranoia—it was, after all, the year before tin-foil Y2K Bugs would signal the end civilization—sometimes with abstract metaphors. The jaw-dropping despair of Brownstein's wearied ballad ""The Size of Our Love"" has a lonely ambience, a love-story plaintively set between hospital walls: ""The ring on my finger/ So tight it turns blue,"" she sings over a crying viola. ""A constant reminder/ I'll die in this room/ If you die in this room."" It's unsurprising that Brownstein has since catapulted her storylines to a mass scale: Comedians are professionals at manipulating our emotions, and if it is one's intention to make people laugh, it must help to have mastered the ability to make them cry.</p>
<p>The sun, ocean, and cosmos build the imagistic single, ""Get Up"". A staccato riff quilts the emphatic drumming, and the guitar tones are magic—had the band not called those natural elements out, it's evident that ""Get Up"" absorbed their expanses. Tucker's hovering speak-sing evokes Kim Gordon beaming down from an imagined heaven on Sonic Youth's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reSOp1domrU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tunic (Song for Karen)""</a>. Echoing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3842-patti-smith/"">Patti Smith</a> as well, Tucker's words fly into the air as if given wings—""Goodbye small hands/ Goodbye small heart/ Goodbye small head""—zen-like as she watches her body go, ""like a whole bucket of stars dumped into the universe."" Sleater-Kinney didn't necessarily follow their '60s rock predecessors into ashram training, but this reflects the Eastern belief that when you die, you become a part of nature. Tucker works through primal desires—""Do you think I'm an animal? Am I not?""—and despite the textured makeover, <i>The Hot Rock</i> emerges as one of Sleater-Kinney's heaviest records.</p>
<p>Swinging back to capital-R Rock, 2000's <b><i>All Hands on the Bad One</i></b> was Sleater-Kinney's most straight-ahead arbiter of thirdwave feminism and also, surprisingly, their most jovial record. Sing-song guitar-pop turned up alongside plainspoken take-downs of sexism in music, and hints of new wave, girl-groups and Go-Gos mixed (cohesively, too) with some of their hardest whiplash-rippers. The enormously hooky ""You're No Rock n' Roll Fun"" taunts dry girl-averse indie snobs: ""You're no rock'n'roll fun/ Like a piece of art that no one can touch!"" the trio sang together, throwing ""whiskey drinks and chocolate bars"" at these guys to shake up the mood, 'cause why not? When Sleater-Kinney note how ""the best man won't hang out with the girl BAA-AAND!"" we're only left wondering why he'd pass on such fun.</p>
<p>Similar humor plays out on ""Milkshake n' Honey"", a <i>Spinal Tap</i>-esque wink at the debauched rocker/groupie complex, but the incisive messages make the best songs: ""The Professional"" uses charged surf-punk to condemn the marginalizing of women in music, ""Male Model"" dismantles the sexist canon and rejects investigations of women's authenticity. A lyrics sheet proves <i>Bad One</i> is Sleater-Kinney's most direct sloganeering, but it doesn't come off as such; Tucker's ferocity and Brownstein's French-sung interjections make it cool, even. ""#1 Must Have"" is the centerpiece, in which Tucker dissects the commodification of riot grrrl and—in light of the rapes at Woodstock in '99—powerfully asserts, ""The number one must-have/ Is that we are safe."" The song's lasting relevance can't be overstated.</p>
<p>The world was irreversibly changed by the time of 2002's <b><i>One Beat</i></b>, Sleater-Kinney's weightiest record. Adventuring with math rock and stomping horns, it was their most explicitly political album, grappling with the aftermath of 9/11 on ""Far Away"" and ""Combat Rock"". These songs reflected the national headspace as selflessly as any act of using someone's tragedy for art allows. Tucker questioned the all-or-nothing patriotism sweeping the U.S., and detailed her own experience that day with raw catharsis, calling-out the hidden President Bush, honoring those who served, and striving for a glimmer of kindness: ""I look to the sky/ And ask it not to rain."" <i>One Beat </i>was not all war songs—the bouncy organ-led love-anthem ""Oh!"" had glammy inflections, ""Prisstina"" chronicled an outcast's discovery of rock. The closer, ""Sympathy"", rips instrumentation from ""Sympathy for the Devil"" but inverts its theme, a prayer for the life of Tucker's premature-born child: ""There is no righteousness in your darkest moment,"" Tucker belts, ""We're all equal in the face of what we're most afraid.""</p>
<p>Even the scope of <i>One Beat</i> couldn't predict Sleater-Kinney's monstrous phase-one farewell, 2005's <b><i>The Woods</i></b><i>. </i>The band's appeal had become that of the indie rock mainstream, and a suburban high-schooler (such as myself, then) could readily learn of <i>The Woods</i>' greatness from the same weirdo dude-friends who repped new CDs by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"">the White Stripes</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a> (like I did). Sleater-Kinney had just played arenas with Pearl Jam, bending notes into heavier, looser sounds, when they journeyed upstate New York to track <i>The Woods</i> with producer David Fridmann, himself only two years removed from helping turn Flaming Lips' 2002 opus <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3081-yoshimi-battles-the-pink-robots/"">Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</a> </i>into a wider breakout.</p>

I am wont to believe Carrie Brownstein when the Sleater-Kinney guitarist, then 21, qualified <a href=""http://meowonline.org/sleater-kinney-riot-grrrl-grows-up/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this 1996 assertion</a> by shrugging it off as a joke. She was, in all likelihood, alluding to the mainstream-affixed mantra of Seattle's blown-up grunge scene, which her own band's roots in the nearby punk-feminist community of Olympia opposed. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/349-bikini-kill/"">Bikini Kill</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"">Fugazi</a> before them, Sleater-Kinney would never succumb to the beckoning of major labels. And in 1996, with their crass punk insurrectionism, the idea of mass success was laughable. Of course, Brownstein's reputation for regional parody on <a href=""http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Portlandia""</a> now precedes her. ""We're never going to be huge like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3272-pearl-jam/"">Pearl Jam</a> or something,"" she said in that interview, ""but I want more people to have access to our music, not just the geeky kids."" Seven years later, in 2003, during the beginnings of the Iraq War, Sleater-Kinney played its <a href=""http://electrip.com/sleater-kinney/1html/showsH/2003shows.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first of many</a> arena-sized gigs—on tour with Pearl Jam.</p>
<p>From 1994 to 2006, Sleater-Kinney seemed to have it all. The trio of Brownstein, singer-guitarist Corin Tucker, and (from '96 on) drummer Janet Weiss created and then fervently revised one of the most distinctive sounds in rock: The friction of their overlapping voices—Brownstein's monotone speak-sing anchoring Tucker's wild vibrato—had an ecstatic, unusual beauty. The expressive longing of Tucker's alone was a gift, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6422-kathleen-hanna/"" target=""_blank"">Kathleen Hanna</a>'s hardcore holler aspiring to the quasi-operatics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2144-iron-maiden"">Iron Maiden</a>'s Bruce Dickinson. Tucker is perhaps the first punk singer to attempt such a thing while worshipping the enormity of, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6279-aretha-franklin/"" target=""_blank"">Aretha Franklin</a>, channeling lessons from the Queen of Soul into her own singing, holding onto moments for dear life and then projecting them to the heavens, becoming <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTHpfZhfQbk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Queen of Rock</a>.</p>
<p>In practice, Sleater-Kinney were humble, imageless indie-rockers; in song, they demanded icon status. This streamlined set, <i>Start Together</i>, captures that dichotomy, archiving the Sleater-Kinney canon with care: from the ideological-punches of thirdwave feminism to their post-riot grrrl classic rock revisionism, all seven albums have been remastered and paired with a plainly gorgeous hardcover photobook, as well as the surprise of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17172-sleater-kinney-bury-our-friends/"" target=""_blank"">reunion-launching 7"" single</a>. In all, <i>Start Together</i> tells the unlikely story of how this band carried the wildfire of '90s Oly-punk to pastures of more ambitious musicality—a decade that moves from caterwauling shrieks to glowing lyricism, from barebones snark to Zep-length improv, from personal-political to outright (left) political.</p>
<p>Sleater-Kinney was consciously <i>about</i> rock'n'roll. Lou Reed sang for Jenny whose life was saved by rock; Ramones told us how Sheena became a punk. In 1994 there was no shortage of women plugging in—newly born classics included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6162-hole/"">Hole</a>'s <i>Live Through This</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3294-liz-phair/"">Liz Phair</a>'s <i>Exile in Guyville</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"">PJ Harvey</a>'s <i>Rid of Me</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/463-the-breeders/"">the Breeders</a>' <i>Last Splash—</i>but the lineage of larger-than-life stars, the deified behind-the-head-shredders, still had few instances of women delivering rock-as-saviour meta-narratives themselves. Sleater-Kinney turned the machismo of hippie-blooded '60s and '70s rock on its head: covers of Springsteen and CCR, homages to Kinks and the Clash, Brownstein's Pete Townshend windmills and shin-kicking swagger, Tucker's defiant declaration that ""I make rock'n'roll!"" A life-or-death seriousness is omnipresent with Sleater-Kinney, but they never rejected rock's base desires—sex, dancing, proverbial milkshakes—although sometimes they vaguely mocked them. Sleater-Kinney stole from men what men had in turn stolen from the margins: electrified blues that all still made girls scream.</p>
<p>The first Sleater-Kinney practice was in March of 1994. It was the spring that Kurt Cobain died. Hindsight paints it clear: Cobain's desire for a future-rock made by women dispersed into the universe. Brownstein and Tucker did Sleater-Kinney as a side-project to their respective bands, the queercore power-chord screams of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1FX46vIY88"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Excuse 17</a> and soul-baring punk of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v_bw-8adTU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Heavens to Betsy</a>. Sleater-Kinney fused these politicized sounds, but as they grew—with affection for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/264-the-b-52s/"">B-52's</a> shimmy and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> cool—they never let the punk rulebook limit their vision. Riot grrrl was fragmenting and they learned from its successes and failures—a radical streak pervaded their writerly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8693-husker-du/"">Hüsker Dü</a>-type storytelling—but they also fought to not be removed from the context of their foundation. The wiry blast of 1995's <b><i>Sleater-Kinney</i></b> is as good an indicator of Bikini Kill's influence as any feminist album since, echoing their sound as well as an interest in making punk become activism.</p>
<p>The debut is foremost a rejection of heteronormative sex, as Tucker and Brownstein were reckoning with life inside their bodies as women who approached sexuality fluidly. There's a song about how much sucking dick sucks, called ""How to Play Dead""—it began Sleater-Kinney's mission of showing how society can silence women and minimize their problems. The urgency is real; all of <i>Sleater-Kinney</i> was scrappily-recorded in one night, on a trip to Australia, where they enlisted drummer Lora MacFarlane, who also kept-time on 1996's <i>Call the Doctor</i>. ""A Real Man"" is like an incendiary take on classic feminist text <i>The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm</i>: ""Don't you wanna feel it inside/ They say that it feels so nice,"" Tucker gasps with visceral sarcasm. Call it clit-rock, I guess; over hard-style riffs, Tucker makes it clear she won't wait ""to cum every time."" Amid this whirlwind of pleasure and pain, which occasionally veers towards emo, Brownstein and Tucker's whispers erupt on ""The Day I Went Away"", one of two wistful songs that foreshadow Sleater-Kinney's impending greatness.</p>
<p>Sleater-Kinney continued feeding its appetite for destruction of archetypes on 1996's <b><i>Call the Doctor</i></b>. It improved their raw punk convictions in every way: more complex guitarwork, more distortion to intellectualize, more aggression and profound sadness. ""Why do good things never wanna stay?"" Tucker asks on ""Good Things"", an earnest stomach-twister of a teardrop tune, while the dire ""Anonymous"" wonders why its female protagonist is voluntarily unspoken. ""I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone"" uses tradition to infiltrate and subvert—the riff could be Ramones pushing Stooges' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJIqnXTqg8I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Wanna Be Your Dog""</a> into the red—to cleverly protest the worship of male icons and spur revolution: ""I wanna be your Joey Ramone/ Pictures of me on your bedroom door/ Invite you back after the show/ I'm the queen of rock and roll."" It's a two-and-half-minute rock'n'roll joyride deserving of a gender studies thesis.</p>
<p>Tucker's fierce and vulnerable depictions of unconventional love marked the title track, where the dueling vocals first exploded. ""It felt like something had opened up,"" Brownstein told <a href=""http://owsk.ms11.net/articles/rsarticle.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rolling Stone</i></a>. ""We just stopped. And [Corin] was like, ‘This is so awesome, you have to keep doing that.’ It felt like I had fused with her. This bolt of lightning had gone from my chest to hers."" <i>Call the Doctor</i> landed at number three on <i>The Village Voice</i>’s then-influential critic’s poll. Their label, Chainsaw, couldn’t press copies fast enough.</p>
<p>Then, behold: Janet Weiss. She joined on 1997's breakneck <b><i>Dig Me Out</i></b>, an all-time great American punk statement, giving Sleater-Kinney the most crucial muscle a drummer can offer: not sheer force, but heart, taking the momentum to a new plane. Sleater-Kinney released their next four records with the larger Olympia feminist label, <a href=""http://www.killrockstars.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kill Rock Stars</a>, but none distilled the band's sound and attitude like <i>Dig Me Out</i>: sometimes brutal heartache, sometimes a menacing threat, always intelligent and extreme, there are enough hooks architected into these two- and three-minute songs to span several albums, but even the added dum-de-dum sugar seems as though it must be raw Portland agave.</p>
<p>""Little Babies"" critiques stereotypes of motherhood, ""Heart Factory"" roars over synthetic emotions of the <i>Prozac Nation</i>, and the instantly classic ""Words and Guitar"" is an ode to rock that just feels necessary. At the peak of ""The Drama You've Been Craving""—Tucker's ""Kick it <i>OUT!</i>""—there are practically fireworks bursting on either side. Really, <i>Dig</i> goes from 0-to-100 within seconds of its opening salvo of a title track, which begs for transcendence from worldly oppression, ""Outta this mess/ Outta my head."" Unlike so much in the trajectory of punk, there is no nihilistic self-destruction in the face of chaos. More than skepticism, anti-consumerism, or the glories of tattoo art, punk teaches empathy, a principle Sleater-Kinney practiced with nuance. This is why Sleater-Kinney's music shines a light despite its loudness, why it is easy to be alone with the songs and feel protected. Sleater-Kinney would never forego the optimism to believe their songbook could make us smarter, angrier, more tender and hopeful. <i>Dig Me Out </i>dreams of a better future, clawing itself up with every note.</p>
<p>The highlight of <i>Dig Me Out</i> and Sleater-Kinney's career, ""One More Hour"" is one of the most devastating break-up songs in rock. ""Oh, you've got the darkest eyes,"" Tucker and Brownstein quaver in unison—the song is about their own short-lived romance—and the way Tucker extends the last word, it is like she can't let them go. There are complex feelings near clear ones, which is what break-ups are: someone wants to untangle the mess, someone wants to snip it apart. ""I needed it,"" Tucker howls, hardly distinguishing where one word ends and another begins. ""One More Hour"" is sublime sadness, a kind one can only know when staring at the end of something and wanting desperately for it not to be so. </p>
<p>This feeling would root 1999's atmospheric <b><i>The Hot Rock</i></b>: subdued and spiritual, it served a number of firsts for Sleater-Kinney, among them a slot on the Billboard charts (at 181). Tucker, Brownstein, and Weiss had never sounded so introspective, existential, and dark, so aesthetically poetic and conventionally pretty. The album's interlocking parts were influenced by the gentle alterna-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1737-the-go-betweens/"">Go-Betweens</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a>; voices intertwine gracefully, as if braiding together dreams and wounds. It's the Sleater-Kinney record you're most likely to play on a train while gazing out the window and getting lost in thought.</p>
<p>Brownstein and Tucker sang of personal becoming, the uncertainties of adulthood, dying relationships and technological paranoia—it was, after all, the year before tin-foil Y2K Bugs would signal the end civilization—sometimes with abstract metaphors. The jaw-dropping despair of Brownstein's wearied ballad ""The Size of Our Love"" has a lonely ambience, a love-story plaintively set between hospital walls: ""The ring on my finger/ So tight it turns blue,"" she sings over a crying viola. ""A constant reminder/ I'll die in this room/ If you die in this room."" It's unsurprising that Brownstein has since catapulted her storylines to a mass scale: Comedians are professionals at manipulating our emotions, and if it is one's intention to make people laugh, it must help to have mastered the ability to make them cry.</p>
<p>The sun, ocean, and cosmos build the imagistic single, ""Get Up"". A staccato riff quilts the emphatic drumming, and the guitar tones are magic—had the band not called those natural elements out, it's evident that ""Get Up"" absorbed their expanses. Tucker's hovering speak-sing evokes Kim Gordon beaming down from an imagined heaven on Sonic Youth's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reSOp1domrU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tunic (Song for Karen)""</a>. Echoing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3842-patti-smith/"">Patti Smith</a> as well, Tucker's words fly into the air as if given wings—""Goodbye small hands/ Goodbye small heart/ Goodbye small head""—zen-like as she watches her body go, ""like a whole bucket of stars dumped into the universe."" Sleater-Kinney didn't necessarily follow their '60s rock predecessors into ashram training, but this reflects the Eastern belief that when you die, you become a part of nature. Tucker works through primal desires—""Do you think I'm an animal? Am I not?""—and despite the textured makeover, <i>The Hot Rock</i> emerges as one of Sleater-Kinney's heaviest records.</p>
<p>Swinging back to capital-R Rock, 2000's <b><i>All Hands on the Bad One</i></b> was Sleater-Kinney's most straight-ahead arbiter of thirdwave feminism and also, surprisingly, their most jovial record. Sing-song guitar-pop turned up alongside plainspoken take-downs of sexism in music, and hints of new wave, girl-groups and Go-Gos mixed (cohesively, too) with some of their hardest whiplash-rippers. The enormously hooky ""You're No Rock n' Roll Fun"" taunts dry girl-averse indie snobs: ""You're no rock'n'roll fun/ Like a piece of art that no one can touch!"" the trio sang together, throwing ""whiskey drinks and chocolate bars"" at these guys to shake up the mood, 'cause why not? When Sleater-Kinney note how ""the best man won't hang out with the girl BAA-AAND!"" we're only left wondering why he'd pass on such fun.</p>
<p>Similar humor plays out on ""Milkshake n' Honey"", a <i>Spinal Tap</i>-esque wink at the debauched rocker/groupie complex, but the incisive messages make the best songs: ""The Professional"" uses charged surf-punk to condemn the marginalizing of women in music, ""Male Model"" dismantles the sexist canon and rejects investigations of women's authenticity. A lyrics sheet proves <i>Bad One</i> is Sleater-Kinney's most direct sloganeering, but it doesn't come off as such; Tucker's ferocity and Brownstein's French-sung interjections make it cool, even. ""#1 Must Have"" is the centerpiece, in which Tucker dissects the commodification of riot grrrl and—in light of the rapes at Woodstock in '99—powerfully asserts, ""The number one must-have/ Is that we are safe."" The song's lasting relevance can't be overstated.</p>
<p>The world was irreversibly changed by the time of 2002's <b><i>One Beat</i></b>, Sleater-Kinney's weightiest record. Adventuring with math rock and stomping horns, it was their most explicitly political album, grappling with the aftermath of 9/11 on ""Far Away"" and ""Combat Rock"". These songs reflected the national headspace as selflessly as any act of using someone's tragedy for art allows. Tucker questioned the all-or-nothing patriotism sweeping the U.S., and detailed her own experience that day with raw catharsis, calling-out the hidden President Bush, honoring those who served, and striving for a glimmer of kindness: ""I look to the sky/ And ask it not to rain."" <i>One Beat </i>was not all war songs—the bouncy organ-led love-anthem ""Oh!"" had glammy inflections, ""Prisstina"" chronicled an outcast's discovery of rock. The closer, ""Sympathy"", rips instrumentation from ""Sympathy for the Devil"" but inverts its theme, a prayer for the life of Tucker's premature-born child: ""There is no righteousness in your darkest moment,"" Tucker belts, ""We're all equal in the face of what we're most afraid.""</p>
<p>Even the scope of <i>One Beat</i> couldn't predict Sleater-Kinney's monstrous phase-one farewell, 2005's <b><i>The Woods</i></b><i>. </i>The band's appeal had become that of the indie rock mainstream, and a suburban high-schooler (such as myself, then) could readily learn of <i>The Woods</i>' greatness from the same weirdo dude-friends who repped new CDs by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3494-queens-of-the-stone-age/"">Queens of the Stone Age</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"">the White Stripes</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a> (like I did). Sleater-Kinney had just played arenas with Pearl Jam, bending notes into heavier, looser sounds, when they journeyed upstate New York to track <i>The Woods</i> with producer David Fridmann, himself only two years removed from helping turn Flaming Lips' 2002 opus <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3081-yoshimi-battles-the-pink-robots/"">Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</a> </i>into a wider breakout.</p>
<p>When your best work is also your most uncompromising and unintelligible, you have accomplished a considerable artistic feat—this was the <i>The Woods</i>. It was tracked live with more distortion than usual, giving it a freneticism, a deranged euphoria. ""[Friddman would] say things to Janet like, 'Play like Keith Moon, but Keith Moon with a blanket coming down over him,'"" Tucker <a href=""http://www.sfbg.com/39/34/cover_music_the_woods.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a>. That possessed orchestra-of-rhythm translated. The album's heaving 11-minute mega-solo, ""Let's Call It Love"", and the soulful echo ""Night Light"", comprise a grandiose jam colored in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12181-deep-purple/"" target=""_blank"">Deep Purple</a>. Zep riffs abound. ""Entertain"" is an atypical military march, declaring war on hollow retro rock; its ""woah-oh-ohs"" are more like shields than exaltations. ""You come around looking 1984/ You're such a bore, 1984/ Nostalgia, you're using it like a whore""—Brownstein's Orwellian invocation opposes this music with a far more poetic dismissal than ""Fuck Interpol."" Sleater-Kinney's first six records gave a lens through which we might imagine a feminist rewrite of classic rock; <i>The Woods</i> is a front-row seat.</p>
<p>""Jumpers"" was inspired by<a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/10/13/jumpers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> a <i>New Yorker</i></a> piece on suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge—""the intensity of feeling that you can't find meaning in your life, so you need to find meaning in your death,"" <a href=""http://www.sfbg.com/39/34/cover_music_the_woods.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brownstein said</a>—which oddly befit the band's decision to end on top. ""Modern Girl"" is Sleater-Kinney's most timeless song, impressionistic as closing one's eyes and staring at the brightest star: ""My whole life was like a picture of a sunny day,"" Brownstein sings, like Sleater-Kinney's ""Yesterday"". But embedded in the soft twinkle is a critique of the consumer culture Sleater-Kinney resisted. (They despised the new proposition of a career-shifting iPod commercial.) The band stopped just as independent music was becoming more financially significant—2004 was the year future indie-Grammy-holders <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a> landed<i>—</i>but traditional notions of integrity were also growing complicated. Brownstein was strangely prophetic: ""I took my money/ And bought me a TV/ TV brings me closer to the world."" This is music you make when you can sense it's one more hour 'til the walls close in.</p>
<p>Little is concrete in rock'n'roll—at the very least, its pivotal moments have often been shrouded in discrepancy and myth. Sister Rosetta Tharpe was the first guitar hero; no, Robert Johnson. Pete Townshend's guitar-smashing was auto-destructive art; no, Townshend's wrecked guitar was privilege. Elvis is dead; Elvis is in Las Vegas. Punk started in London—no, New York—girls started punk rock, not England. But there are unequivocal truths of Sleater-Kinney's career. Objectively, the trio was born of riot grrrl, an underground band that started with two girls together in a living room and became the movement's greatest critical success and so much more: an initial seven-album streak worthy of setting in stone eternal. There is an overcast art-print that accompanies <i>Start Together</i>, set at a weathered race track: Tucker is pounding pavement with a raised fist, Weiss is caught in a fierce skip, and Brownstein, in the middle, has both arms extended skyward, cracking a smile as if she just crushed a marathon. In reality, the band was only just beginning. Sleater-Kinney look invincible there, triumphant even, like superheroes, and if <i>Start Together</i> proves a thing, it is that with passion, persistence, and unwavering purpose, ordinary people can become them.</p></div>"|19860.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19860-sleater-kinney-start-together/|9.4|Jenn Pelly

He has a habit of ""returning,"" whenever coming off of a break (voluntary or <a href=""http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/rapper-ti-sentenced-11-months-jail/story?id=11897544"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">involuntary</a>), with a torrential, unmanageable flood of new material. He did it with 2010's<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14923-no-mercy/""><i> No Mercy</i></a>, a bone-tired and dogged-sounding effort that felt like clockwork from someone determined not to disappear but lacking a larger reason to be recording. </p>
<p>On the surface,<i> Paperwork </i>appears like it come from this same place; it arrives at what looks like the beginning of T.I.'s post-gangsta rap ""<a href=""http://www.vh1.com/shows/ti_and_tiny_the_family_hustle/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">suburban dad</a>"" phase, when his most visible recent contributions to pop culture are his ""Blurred Lines"" verse and the ascendency of Iggy Azalea. The album feels fired up, though, instead of muddled and tired. His last record boasted that he was the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17525-trouble-man-heavy-is-the-head/""><i>Trouble Man</i></a>, but with a clear mind and fewer visible burdens, Clifford Harris has produced his most thoughtful and substantive record in years.</p>
<p>It is also the most excited he's sounded to be rapping since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12279-paper-trail/""><i>Paper Trail</i></a>. His voice and flow patterns are so inimitable they run the risk of becoming sound effects, but he's pushing himself out of familiar cadences and revisiting some of the demented, spitfire youthful energy that used to make him unpredictable. You can also hear subliminal Jay-style flow-patterning at work, an old trick you'd hear whenever Jay Z appeared next to a truly great rapper. It's usually a sign that a rapper is engaging with his guests instead of just pasting their emailed verses into sound files, and Tip is flaunting it here: He sounds vaguely Boosie-esque on the Boosie-guested ""Jet Fuel"", and on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">Young Thug</a>-featuring ""About That Money"" he takes a few tentative hops into Thugga's stratosphere, pinching his throat and rapping in a near-insectoid voice.</p>
<div>
<p>Perhaps not-incidentally, <i>Paperwork</i> is also T.I.'s first record since his contract with the infamously risk-averse Atlantic Records ended. Now he's signed his Grand Hustle imprint to Columbia and is acting more and more like a label mogul, and <i>Paperwork</i> bears the marks of an artist grateful for stretching room. There is, to be sure, a fair amount of commercial-rap-record box-checking: He still does <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32441-dj-mustard/"">DJ Mustard</a>, who produces the Iggy Azalea-assisted ""No Mediocre""; a Chris Brown-featured sex jam (for ""Private Show"") and another <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10008-usher/"">Usher</a> collaboration (""At Ya Own Risk""). But he finds ways to enliven even these <i>pro forma</i> moves: ""At Ya Own Risk"" is a novelty—a  menacing, even murderous-sounding bedroom song. The Skylar Grey power ballad (""New National Anthem"") is an indignant and incisive commentary on America's gun culture.</p>
<p>There are a lot of intriguing ""off"" notes like this that make <i>Paperwork</i> feel like T.I.'s passion project, cleverly disguised as a superstar's contractual-obligation release. (That album title doesn't help.) The four songs co-produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4851-pharrell/"">Pharrell</a>—""G Shit"", ""Oh Yeah,"" ""Paperwork"", and ""Light Em Up""—are rough, sharp-edged, and unique compositions, somewhere between current trap and early N.E.R.D. His rapping consistently fires off sparklers—""suicide, you should commit it, save a G a life sentence,"" he leers on ""Oh Yeah"". ""If only the masses could see your ass when it's in action,"" he says, sliding into all the ""sss""s, on the otherwise-rote ""Private Show"". On ""Light Em Up"", a song that deliberately recalls the vivid murkiness of classic Dungeon Family, he pays powerful tribute to his friend and labelmat Doe B, who was shot and killed in 2013.

<p>Which is somewhat disappointing and even more surprising<span>—</span>Twilight Sad have always been savvy about anticipating diminishing returns. Following their gripping and <a href=""http://www.roughtradenyc.com/event/601119-twilight-sad-perform-fourteen-brooklyn"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">enduring</a> 2007 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10111-fourteen-autumns-and-fifteen-winters/""><i>Fourteen Autumns and Fifteen Winters</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13493-forget-the-night-ahead/""><i>Forget the Night Ahead</i></a> served as the prototypical, “darker, more difficult” sophomore LP, quite the accomplishment considering the already downtrodden emotional tenor that preceded it. But rather than sinking deeper into the murk, Twilight Sad maintained their essence while swapping out almost all of their superficial sonic signifiers<span>—</span>turbulent guitar noise and resounding drums were exchanged for icy synths, frigid post-punk, and clangorous drum machines on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16189-no-one-can-ever-know/""><i>No One Can Ever Know</i></a>. In between, they’ve stripped down and reworked their originals for live performances and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12158-here-it-never-snowed-afterwards-it-did-ep/"">EPs</a>, and have been open to remixes of their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14221-nil-liars-remix/"">own</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14398-sick-com-truise-remix/""> work</a>. Point being that they’ve covered far more territory than you’d expect from a Scottish mope-rock band and <i>Nobody Wants to Be Here</i> wisely attempts to reestablish the Twilight Sad in 2014 by offering a comprehensive overview.</p>
<p>In a sense, that much is accomplished<span>—</span>while the Twilight Sad keeps the machinery around in a supporting role, these are guitar and drum songs, as they were in the past. Meanwhile, <i>Fourteen Autumns</i> producer Peter Katis returns with a booming, room-filling expansiveness that once tied Twilight Sad to his previous charges such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2112-interpol"">Interpol</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national"">the National</a>. But rather than demonstrating the range of Twilight Sad, <i>Nobody Wants to Be Here</i> coalesces every one of their modes into a gray, midtempo whole that curtails the extremism on both sides. Eerie synth wobbles interrupt the hypnosis brought on by the cyclical opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17055-the-twilight-sad-theres-a-girl-in-the-corner/"">“There’s a Girl in the Corner”</a>, but otherwise, the electronics cloak <i>Nobody Wants to Be Here</i> in musty shadows. Andy MacFarlane’s once-volcanic guitar work has cooled to an ashy remnant, as he favors curlicued melodic patterns that also recall the National more than, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"">Mogwai</a>. <i></i><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Meanwhile, drummer Mark Devine remains curiously underutilized, forgoing both his punishingly loud thumping on </span><i>Fourteen Autumns</i><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> and </span><i>Forget the Night Ahead</i><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> and the militant precision of </span><i>No One Can Ever Know</i><i><span>—</span></i>the title track and “Last January” respectively recall the obsessive locomotion of <i>No One</i>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12640-sick/"">“Sick”</a> and “Don’t Move”, and later on, “Drown So I Can Watch” is only a slight variation on “Last January”.</p>
<p>James Graham colludes with his band’s most sedate arrangements rather than contrasting them, which increases the difficulty of him getting his point across. This, despite his knack for threatening, tensile mantras<span>—</span>“So cold I know where you go/ Telling me no,” “So we dance to save them all,” “She’ll carry me away from here.” As usual, the song titles are evocative (“In Nowheres”, “Sometimes I Wished I Could Fall Asleep”) and his performances are expressive, but Graham’s words always withhold something crucial, strongly suggesting either childhood trauma still yet to be processed, or deep-seated romantic troubles yet to emerge.  This had usually been compensated for by a jarring musical rupture or an unexpected leap in his vocal range, but Twilight Sad are stingy with any sort of catharsis and so their sonically warmest and most accessible album is their most emotionally impenetrable.</p>
<p>The mixed messages encoded in <i>Nobody Wants to Be Here</i> were hinted at in <a href=""http://www.goldflakepaint.co.uk/what-do-you-care-for-an-interview-with-the-twilight-sad/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an interview with Graham from earlier this year</a>; he claimed a rejuvenated interest in the concept of the Twilight Sad but only after a difficult writing process and a year's worth of discouragement in light of the cool reception that met the underappreciated <i>No Can Ever Know</i>. It certainly couldn’t have helped to see former touring member Martin Doherty use them as a foil for the neon-lit synth-pop he now creates in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30747-chvrches/"">Chvrches</a>—he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9077-chvrches/"">told us</a>, “I’m having more fun on stage than I did in previous bands,” the implication being that, hey, <i>being in </i><i>the Twilight Sad was bringing me down, man</i>. That was the case for Graham too, as he expressed a need to return to making music that works in a big room; and perhaps it’s in a live setting where one can truly bear witness to the Twilight Sad’s newfound commitment, as the lack of palplable passion on <i>Nobody Wants to Be Here </i>is, once again, somewhat disappointing and even more surprising.</p></div>"|19811.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19811-the-twilight-sad-nobody-wants-to-be-here-and-nobody-wants-to-leave/|5.8|Ian Cohen

Nominally a metal act, they’ve anchored both of their full-length albums to itinerant bristling guitars and doubled-down drums, with sections that plunged alternately into doom’s lurch and death’s leaps. At their best, though, Inter Arma function more as a gyre of genres than a unilateral machine; on last year’s standout <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17607-inter-arma-sky-burial/""><i>Sky Burial</i></a>, they integrated electric psych sprawl and acoustic pastoral interludes, working as five surly dudes not ashamed to admit that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2439-led-zeppelin/"">Led Zeppelin</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a> were more lifelines than mere gateways. Inter Arma, however, have never been all-inclusive. They plucked from the musical multiverse with an unapologetic ear for the grand, where valleys implied multiple peaks and any sense of quiet only served to amplify the power to come. Despite its more staid moments, <i>Sky Burial</i> aimed for overall ascent. On that eight-piece album, where themes dissolved only to reappear, the divisions between tracks sometimes felt like commercial concessions for the group’s big <a href=""http://www.relapse.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Relapse Records</a> debut. It’s not hard to imagine its hour-plus runtime moving uninterrupted, a direct line toward the heavens.</p>
<p>They finally do that on <i>The Cavern</i>, Inter Arma’s first single-song EP. Though the track lasts for 46 minutes, it feels like a condensed and uncompromising version of the quintet’s prevailing vision. The band climbs a slope of increasing momentum, where every step seems to find the action growing bigger and bolder. Though these kind of hour-long escapades can often suggest stunts by an act eager for a convenient concept and quick adulation, <i>The Cavern</i> feels like what Inter Arma should have done all along—fade into a piece, rip through an idea without hesitation, fade out of the piece, repeat. Written in 2009, <i>The Cavern </i>predates both Inter Arma LPs, but it was discarded until an employee at Relapse learned of its existence and urged the band to revisit it. After refining the composition, they finally captured it during a long session last year in Tennessee before gilding it with violin from former U.S. Christmas member Meg Mulhearn and vocals from Windhand singer Dorthia Cottrell. It’s the kind of commanding performance that both Inter Arma albums have implied, delivered now without hesitation or penance.</p>
<p><i>The Cavern </i>centers around a story of epic death: The protagonist wakes in a desert and lingers at the precipice of mortality until, when the sun sets, a light emerges from a cave tucked inside a solitary mountain peak. He crawls toward the luminescent oasis, climbs inside and, as he falls asleep, realizes this will become his final resting place. As the song ends, he gives over to darkness, which takes the shape of a Persephone-like beauty “whose long hair veils her face.” Cottrell supplies the god voice during a gorgeous, kaleidoscope-sky midsection, her echoing vocals stretched between a nightmare and a daydream.</p>
<p>The narrative prevents the ever-fluid<i> Cavern </i>from becoming too formless, from shifting between moods or motifs without warning or reason. Sure, parts emerge wholly unexpected, such as an electrifying and Allman-like guitar turnaround that the band likes to revisit, or Cottrell’s sudden and august arrival. But even those aberrations fit into the meticulously framed whole, part of a comprehensive system. During the first 15 minutes, for instance, the band volleys between two sections—a slow, swollen trudge and a quickened, belligerent half-thrash; that’s when the subject first realizes he’s in peril, stranded in an inhospitable clime. The same surroundings return for the finale, when the hero realizes what he hoped was his salvation actually will be his downfall. The drums press harder, and the once-sharp riffs of the guitar fray at their ends, adding death’s door urgency. It’s a musical <i>inclusio</i>, the signposts pointing to how things have gone from pragmatically bad to existentially black.</p>
<p>The timing of <i>The Cavern</i> is fortuitous. Had Inter Arma released it ahead of both of their albums, especially before the Relapse deal, it’s easy to imagine the audacity being overlooked as a gimmick from a young, anonymous act. But <i>Sundown</i> and <i>Sky Burial</i> broadcasted the range of Inter Arma, or the limits to which they were willing to go to conjure an air of triumph. This reconfigured take on <i>The Cavern</i>, which arrives after the band has had a chance to mature on the road and in the studio, condenses and cements those elements, never allowing for any sign of an easy exit. It’s their most riveting release to date, a simple story charged by a complicated sound.</p></div>"|19523.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19523-inter-arma-the-cavern-ep/|8.3|Grayson Haver Currin

But following the passing of Relapse Records staffer <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/indies/1549328/pat-egan-of-relapse-records-dies"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pat Egan</a> in 2013, the progressive grindcore outfit bundled those two orphaned tracks as the <i>Mass &amp; Volume </i>EP, sold it digitally, and donated the proceeds to Egan’s family. A year and a half later, <i>Mass &amp; Volume </i>is seeing the light of day as an official, physical release. As a gesture of kindness to a departed comrade—Pig Destroyer have been a cornerstone of Relapse’s roster since their 2000 split with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2122-isis/"">Isis</a>—it’s beautiful. As a doom-ridden detour from the group’s typical blitzkrieg of dense, hyper-literate grind, it’s downright ugly.</p>
<p>Unlike the frantic <i>Phantom Limb</i>—or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17255-book-burner/""><i>Book Burner</i></a>, Pig Destroyer’s intervening album—<i>Mass &amp; Volume</i> is slow. As in, glacier-dragging-a-fallen-planetoid slow. In that sense, it draws from the dour, down-tuned slither of doom metal, but it’s a far cry from either the antediluvian groove of Pentagram or the antiheroic songcraft of recent outfits like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31425-lycus/"">Lycus</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30107-pallbearer/"">Pallbearer</a>. The EP’s first song, “Mass &amp; Volume”, is clearly the sound of a grind band unhinging its jaw to accommodate the proportions of doom; most Pig Destroyer tracks do their duty in under three minutes, while “Mass &amp; Volume” weighs in at over 19. When Pig Destroyer decides to play doom, however, it’s best to assume it won’t go unexamined. All the requisite components are there: hovering feedback, threatening riffs, and chasms of pregnant space. But frontman J. R. Hayes unfurls his unintelligible tongue as if it’s the red carpet to hell, a far more alien delivery than most doom bands, and guitarist Scott Hull is just as apt to let his instrument drone, disintegrate, and ultimately eat its own tail as he is to actually summon a chord.</p>
<p>“Red Tar” is only three times as long as your average Pig Destroyer song,<b> </b>but those<b> </b>six and a half minutes are milked of every conceivable ounce of sludge. Here the EP finally resembles a Pig Destroyer 45 played on 33, plain and simple, with none of the compositional mutation on display in “Mass &amp; Volume”. It’s the perfect complement; tighter and more coherent—inasmuch as Hayes and Hull’s mutual assured deconstruction could ever be called coherent—the song creeps from plateau to plateau, leaving a trail of viscera in its wake.<b> </b>“Grief crawls in the shadow of time/ Try to keep in mind/ It’s all finite,” Hayes grunts in existential agony. Instead of seeming like some noble savage, he’s a trapped animal, snarling and soon to be gutted.</p>
<p>The fact that “Mass &amp; Volume” and “Red Tar” were amputated from the final version of <i>Phantom Limb</i> lends the two songs their own sick humor and grotesque gravity—qualities that, not coincidentally, Pig Destroyer specialize in. It’s left to the listener’s imagination to guess how appropriate the EP might be as a tribute to Egan. That shouldn’t matter, of course; a good EP is a good EP, and <i>Mass &amp; Volume </i>fits that bill. Yet the circumstances surrounding any piece of music are not separable from the experience of hearing it, and that’s how it should be. Pig Destroyer has long trafficked in the absurdism of mortality, the profundity of body-horror, and the contortion of metal tropes themselves. There’s a perverse soulfulness at the core of their music, though, and in slowing their berserk onslaught to a vulnerable slither, Hayes and crew have turned <i>Mass &amp; Volume</i> into something heart-stoppingly sorrowful. Pig Destroyer, poignant? The notion isn’t as strange—nor, as the EP demonstrates, as forced—as one might think. <i>Mass &amp; Volume</i> barely moves, but it’s definitely moving.</p></div>"|19763.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19763-pig-destroyer-mass-volume-ep/|7.4|Jason Heller

More importantly, while they’ve maintained something of a power trio lineup, no one asks them a question so often posed to “rock bands”—“How are they going to pull this off live?” The apt comparisons to the otherwise incomparable Talk Talk are warranted, as the creation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13951-hidden/""><i>Hidden</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18103-these-new-puritans-field-of-reeds/""><i>Field of Reeds</i></a> were similarly defined by the trio’s isolation—from trends, from budgetary constraints and from the mundanity of the album cycle. Likewise, they use near-mythical tales of studio trickery to tease fans rather than singles, as <a href=""http://vimeo.com/30493486"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Victoria’s Secret money</a> gets funneled into Foley effects and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9128-these-new-puritans/"">falconry</a>, Britain’s lowest voice and eight-foot Japanese taiko drums. But if they <i>are </i>going to pull <i>this</i> off live, These New Puritans aren’t ones to half-ass anything and so, this is how we arrive at <i>Expanded</i>—performing with a 35-piece orchestra, at ""Europe's largest multi-arts and conference venue.""</p>
<p>This isn’t just the best means of presenting <i>Field of Reeds</i> live, it might be the only way. Another commonality These New Puritans share with late-period Talk Talk is a status of being commercial non-entities in the States and believe me, no matter how suave they look on stage, this is awkward as hell in a rock club that might otherwise host, say, Finch or Marilyn Manson in 2014<span>—</span>earlier this year, I saw an impeccable performance interrupted by Sunset Strip stragglers and a Brazilian guy on Molly who kept requesting <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzHwRcOsDNw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Elvis”</a>. By comparison, the polite clapping that accompanies <i>Expanded</i> may puncture the hermetic seal, but it doesn’t take all of the air out; if anything, it serves as a reminder that this is not a typical rock show.</p>
<p>Jack Barnett has been forthcoming about his lack of instrumental or compositional knowledge, but he is an exacting boss; these musicians are trained to <i>not</i> fuck up and they are not held to lower standards because These New Puritans are technically a pop band. So the alterations are minor, if any: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15425-these-new-puritans-fragment-two/"">“Fragment Two”</a> was <i>Field of Reeds</i>’ most conventional moment and that’s obviously relative. And so it’s subject to the most conventional effect of live performance, which is that it plays slightly faster and looser than its studio counterpart. Meanwhile, “Island Song” goes straight into the incantatory portion of its mesmerizing coda rather than teasing it out as it does on the record.</p>
<p>Even the most inscrutable sounds on <i>Field of Reeds</i> evolved from an organic source and the most “how’d they do that?” moments are captured with startling clarity<span>—</span>the undulating, magnetic resonator-piano melody that snakes throughout “Island Song”, the hypnotic motifs of “Organ Eternal”, the glass-shattering crescendo of “The Light in Your Name”. In fact, Barnett and his charges are so adept at recreating the subtle complexities of <i>Field of Reeds</i>, that they don’t just render <i>Expanded</i> a total misnomer. They call its entire reason for existence into question.</p>
<p>With the exception of a two-minute “Intro Tape”, These New Puritans play <i>Field of Reeds</i> almost verbatim<span>—</span>in its exact order, with little, if any variation from the original versions. So why listen to this instead of <i>Field of Reeds</i>?<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56924-these-new-puritans-release-film-of-expanded-live-performance-with-35-piece-band/""> Barnett considers<i> Expanded</i> to be on the level of TNP’s albums</a> and called these performances improvements over the originals; but it’s too close to call even for those who’ve completely immersed within <i>Field of Reeds</i>’ otherworldly environs, which is even more disappointing than the typical refractory release, i.e., the well-intentioned and often terribly-executed remix album. Considering the austerity of its arrangements and their open-ended structure, <i>Field of Reeds</i> actually stands as a rare instance of a record that could lend itself to total teardowns.</p>
<p>The price of admission is warranted once the record-setting basso profundo of “Field of Reeds” fades out; new composition “Spitting Stars” is another lovely, pastoral collaboration with Graham Sutton, but considering the long latency periods and wild deviations from one These New Puritans record to the next, it’s likely an appendage to <i>Field of Reeds</i> rather than an indication of where they might go next. There are also two selections from <i>Hidden,</i> the more intimidating, less “orchestral” predecessor to <i>Field of Reeds</i> and the record that would have been better suited to this format.</p>
<p>For all of its stunt sonics<span>—</span>smashed watermelons, sharpened knives, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2YLIcovLjw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">M.I.A. interpolations</a><span>—</span>much of it was proudly composed on cheap keyboards. As such, “We Want War” embodies the entire timeline of human combat, from sticks and stones to modern digital strikes. But with the addition of Portuguese fado singer Elisa Rodrigues and the orchestral replacements for those digital dancehall patches, the textures of “We Want War” and proto-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus""><i>Yeezus</i></a> banger <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHy08s3CCso"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Three Thousand”</a> are too cohesive, sounding closer to the overblown bombast of Michael Bay or Metallica’s <i>S&amp;M</i>.</p>
<p>But it's more of a disappointment than a failure<span>—at the very least, it might serve as <i>someone</i>'<i>s </i>introduction to These New Puritans</span>. But there is precedent for bands just as studiocentric properly utilizing this style of live performance: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4557-minimum-maximum/"">Kraftwerk's <i>Minimum-Maximum</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead"">Portishead</a>’s <i>PNYC</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"">Spiritualized</a>’s <i>Royal Albert Hall, October 10, 1997: Live</i> <span>—</span>and if <i>Expanded</i> doesn’t reach that level by any means, at least it’s more worthwhile than the track-by-track, aggressively redundant cash-ins of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure"">the Cure</a>’s <i>Trilogy</i> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode"">Depeche Mode</a>’s <i>Songs of Faith and Devotion Live</i>. But if it takes a classic rock cliche to emphasize how far beyond rock These New Puritans really are, then <i>Expanded </i>is a total success.</p></div>"|19852.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19852-these-new-puritans-expanded-live-at-the-barbican/|6.4|Ian Cohen

Sounds that were long considered niche are now mainstream. It's an exciting space to be in, as the possibilities of electronic music's history are basically endless, but it's also somewhat confusing. Who and what do we talk about when we talk about electronic music? Where do we draw the line between what electronic music was and what it has become? And why, if at all, is it important to make these distinctions?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">No surprise, then, that 2014 has given us more questions about ""proper"" electronic music than answers. Young producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31081-sophie/"">Sophie</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/485-pc-music/"">the PC Music camp</a> contextualized contemporary dance and pop permutations in their own high-gloss chicken-or-the-egg scenarios; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a> reinvigorated his career with an album that bucks current trends (many of which he's at least partially responsible for) by ignoring them altogether; and hardworking elder statesman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> released two records with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4418-underworld/"">Underworld</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31209-karl-hyde"">Karl Hyde</a> that expressly contradicted each other's sounds, styles, and creative processes.

Maybe that's because he's been a leader in the electronic music conversation since 2011, when his first solo 12"" snuck up behind dubstep and yanked the rug out from under it. Though ""The Goose That Got Away"" and ""Tinderbox"" have very little to do with the sleek, weighty tracks Hertz produces in his Berlin studio these days, the deep technical knowledge that helped make them possible is still central to Objekt's musical identity. Here is an artist who studied electronic and information engineering at University of Oxford, has developed software both personally and professionally (for tech giant Native Instruments), </span><a href=""https://www.dubstepforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=251097"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>readily</span></a><span> and </span><a href=""http://www.xlr8r.com/gear/2013/11/artist-tips-objekt-offers-five-t"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>openly</span></a><span> shares tips, tricks, and advice with other producers, and only further hones his craft with each intermittent release. Nevermind if Objekt has any solutions for the state of electronic music, we have more to gain from knowing what he ponders and hearing how he manifests those thoughts.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Though his approach to techno may appear clinical or overly academic, Objekt's productions always feel animated and impulsive; </span><i>Flatland</i><span> is experimental to its core, but it never considers polish and passion to be mutually exclusive. It's because Hertz can fashion fiercely tactile and resilient elements with textbook precision that the basslines in his menacing ""Dogma"" use your backbone like a seismometer. And it's how ""Ratchet"" projects Cybotron's Detroit electro-isms from cathode tube monitors into a 3-D virtual environment. As an intro, ""Agnes Revenge"" dazzles with hi-def depictions of cryonized steel shattering ice blocks in ultra slow-mo, which Objekt inverts and further details during the noxious seepage of ""Agnes Apparatus"". No matter if it's functioning as soundsystem armament or headphone oddity, </span><i>Flatland</i><span> won't hesitate to travel down every avenue uncovered by the refined programming, ingenious sound theory, and liberal stylistic influences it was mapped with.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Which is why the record sounds rooted in electronic music's history even as it carves out an alternate future. Learned perfectionist that he is, Hertz knows the secrets of Drexciyan history, Autechre's essential deep cuts, Speedy J's trusty drum patterns, and what makes Richard D. James a legendary producer—using such seminal influences not to revive the past, but to reinvent it for his own purposes. The chugging thump in ""Strays"" may not have been made with an actual Roland TR-909, nor the acid sequences of ""One Fell Swoop"" or ""Interlude (Whodunnit?)"" with a 303, but Objekt can nonetheless capture each machine's warm, gritty soul with his own digitial approximation. Hertz remains dedicated to his icons while subverting their methods because he does so with the avant-garde spirit passed down through their work.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-d02efc33-364f-446e-256a-93e75325f540""><span>Throughout <i>Flatland</i>, Objekt reclaims his genre's all-too-familiar affectations by making us hear them for the first time all over again. It's a rare album that sounds so vivid and transparent despite its densely intricate constructions. Stranger still, it's one</span><span> largely devoid of apparent melodies and climactic structures, instead using pristine sound design and dynamically expressive arrangements in the way an expert orchestra plays a symphony's fluid notation. <i>Flatland </i>isn't remarkable for answering any of electronic music's questions, it's remarkable because it lets us consider them from a completely new perspective.</span></span></p></div>"|19840.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19840-objekt-flatland/|8.0|Patric Fallon

At times, it sounds quite sparse, with just a central melody orbited by distant tones; Bing &amp; Ruth have clearly taken their time on these recordings, but by no means is this “slow” music meant for background listening. Instead, <i>Tomorrow Was the Golden Age</i> teems with life the same way an inanimate city skyline is filled with people unseen to the naked eye. This music <i>moves</i>, almost constantly, and even when Bing &amp; Ruth are seemingly sitting still, their gears are whirring, however silently, on a different plane.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The project is anchored by pianist and composer David Moore, who’s been working in a variety of avant-classical mediums for a decade now (you can preview a variety of his smaller releases on <a href=""http://talkhappytalk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his Bandcamp page</a>). Bing &amp; Ruth’s first album, the 2010 LP <i>City Lake</i>, was reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"">Sufjan Stevens</a>’ own classical diversions, a series of bright pieces that occasionally employed the human voice in tandem with chamber-ensemble arrangements. The debut was a relatively straightforward release, but <i>Tomorrow Was the Golden Age</i> isn’t; aided by the addition of a tape delay tech, the record’s nine compositions take on a trippy, halo-effect shape, every sonic abstraction and bent tone radiating a strange, benevolent glow. For a suite that could be called “minimalist,” <i>Tomorrow Was the Golden Age</i> proves surprisingly tactile, a shifting variety of textures that move from mossy to feather-delicate.</p>
<p class=""p1"">For <i>Tomorrow Was the Golden Age</i>, Bing &amp; Ruth narrowed down their ensemble—two upright bassists, two clarinets, a cellist, the tape-delay tech, and Moore on piano—but while <i>City Lake</i> had a larger scope, this new record feels heavier by design. Credit is due to clarinetists Jeremy Viner and Patrick Breiner, whose bent notes are integral to this record’s many complexities; on opening track “Warble”, they add a sense of dread to Moore’s rustling, overlapping piano figures, aiding greatly in the subtle melodic shifts taking place. On “Reflector”, their instruments sound like ghosts heaving deep sighs in the wind, pushing and sustaining against a decaying piano.</p>
<p class=""p1"">“Reflector” is one of a few moments on <i>Tomorrow Was the Golden Age</i> where the melody that’s explored, deconstructed, and lingered-upon ends up sticking with you long after the track is over. The sense of humanity found in these compositions, and the broad range of emotions they convey—longing, contemplation, muted joy, confusion, a quiet but deeply felt ecstasy—go a long way to make <i>Tomorrow Was the Golden Age</i> accessible. At times, you can hear the New York trappings in Bing &amp; Ruth’s music—conceivably, this music could soundtrack busy city streets, or the metropolitan sprawl’s dawn-hour emptiness. But <i>Tomorrow Was the Golden Age</i>, one of the finest left-field releases of the year, transcends geography, inviting you to close your eyes and build your own richly detailed world.</p></div>"|19887.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19887-bing-ruth-tomorrow-was-the-golden-age/|8.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

As great as their output has been to date, the New York ensemble had more or less painted themselves into a corner. In truth, there were many directions the group could have headed toward on their fourth album, but they dauntingly chose the path of most imaginable resistance: doom metal. Rub your eyes all you want; it won’t change that sentence. The Budos Band’s new album is called <i>Burnt Offering</i>—and from its wizard-sporting cover on down, it draws heavily from the late-'60s/early-'70s well of dark, arcane proto-metal.</p>
<p>To be perfectly clear: This is not your uncle’s Primus-shirted funk-metal. The majority of <i>Burnt Offering</i> is built on the same framework that the Budos Band has always used—elegantly simple guitar, deep pockets of syncopation, and bold shouts of brass—but here it’s been wreathed in the thick organ vamps of the bands that helped inspire metal, namely Iron Butterfly and Uriah Heep. Those looking for kvlt cred won’t find it here, nor should they; the album’s heaviest tracks, like the fuzz-slathered “Aphasia” and the gutbucket-distorted title track don’t come anywhere near the metal orthodoxy of Pentagram, let alone Black Sabbath. This is still Afrofunk of the Fela Kuti faith, with “Tomahawk” being the most horn-splashed and intricately polyrhythmic of the bunch.</p>
<p>When the delicate guitar intro of “Magus Mountain” drops into a propulsive, blown-out low gear, though, it’s as if Sir Lord Baltimore is jamming with <i>Maggot Brain</i>-era Funkadelic. The fidelity is immaculately retro, saturated and reverberating, which lends an even more eerily anachronistic tone to simmering, sinuous cuts such as “Black Hills” and “Turn and Burn”, the latter of which lands the album in some swampy epoch of alternate history. “Into the Fog” more or less says it all; with organ chords transmogrified into haunted-house groans, and monstrous stomps shuffling somewhere between Blue Öyster Cult's “Godzilla” and Fela’s “Zombie”, the song is all meat, zero subtext. Not that an album this earthy needs anything so subtle to get its freaky point across.</p>
<p><i>Burnt Offering </i>has its own kind of subtlety, and most of it is in the interplay between meter, genre, and mood. When it falls a little flat, on the tame, muted “Trail of Tears” and “Shattered Winds”, it still manages to register as better-than-average Afrofunk with a tasteful layer of filthy hard rock smeared on top. It's not a profound exercise in fusion, and at times it seems the band might be amusing themselves at the expense of being taken seriously. But the most remarkable thing about <i>Burnt Offering</i> is that, at its core, it really isn’t all that much of a departure from what the Budos Band has always done. The neatest trick the album pulls off is in finding the unexplored commonality between Afrofunk and doom metal—deep grooves, murky atmosphere, hypnotic riffs—then playing them with joy and loopy abandon. Spooky, funky, freedom-loving fun: The chance to embrace something like that doesn’t come along often, and it’s to be cherished.</p></div>"|19815.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19815-the-budos-band-burnt-offering/|7.3|Jason Heller

It’s an odd line, jutting out from the song at an obtuse angle and snagging your attention—at least until you remember that a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamprey"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lamprey</a> is a parasitic fish that lives by burrowing into the skin of its host. It’s not especially romantic imagery; in fact, it’s possibly more visceral than Porterfield intended for such a gentle track. He certainly sings it like a love song. <i>Marigolden</i> is full of similarly head-scratching turns of phrases, similes and metaphors that are aggressively poetic. “His tessellated love is all around,” goes “Enchantment”. On “Summons”, Porterfield admits, “I’ve been pissing coffee, quinine, and lime.” He might want to see a doctor for that. </p>
<p>Porterfield may be best known as a former member of DeYarmond Edison, the Wisconsin supergroup-in-retrospective that included <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5976-justin-vernon/"">Justin Vernon</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a> and Brad and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29649-phil-cook/"">Phil Cook</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7129-megafaun/"">Megafaun</a>. It took him five years to pen the songs on his 2012 self-titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17103-field-report/"">debut</a>, after which he toured constantly, quit drinking, and pared his band down to a tight quartet. If his former bandmates emphasize music over lyrics, Porterfield deals with words over notes. Rooted in acoustic guitar strums, sustained piano chords, and post-<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10709-for-emma-forever-ago/"">Emma</a></i> soundscapes, these arrangements are spare and gentle and occasionally obligatory as they tenderly cradle the painstakingly wrought lyrics. When the band reach for something more, however, the results have a lot more personality: “Wings” layers instruments and synths against a steady rhythm to create a sort of rustic <i>kosmische</i> sound that could sustain a full album.</p>
<p>But Field Report isn’t a band exactly. It’s every bit the songwriter project its anagram name suggests. Porterfield writes long, word-dense songs that typically lack choruses and bridges, but usually compensate with fluttery melodic lines and strong hooks. First single “Home (Leave the Lights On)” quickens excitedly around its bright and unabashedly sentimental refrain, which conjures the exhaustion and excitement of the final leg of a long roadtrip: “Leave the lights on, 'cause it might be nighttime when I get there.” As a wordsmith, Porterfield is certainly distinctive, at times insistently so. Nights are “bruiseblack” in these songs, and women tend to “smell like saffron.” Such details are meant to evoke particular emotions and sensations, but they tend to be distracting and meaningless beyond their own desperate desire to mean <i>something</i>.</p>
<p><i>Marigolden</i> fares best when it loses the florid similes and addresses character and story. On the piano ballad “Ambrosia”, he recounts his wayward adolescence, when he dipped Skoal with the sheriff’s son. “He was cruel to the other kids just for fun,” Porterfield recalls. “I never had the stones to tell him off.” That kid committed suicide “on a golf course with a gun,” and those details are horrifying in their specificity and banality. The song treats the kid’s depression and death not like a bully’s comeuppance, but more like the tragedy of someone who never earned forgiveness or redemption. This handful of lines contains an entire life—albeit one cut sadly short—and it’s easily the most affecting moment on the album. It should come as no coincidence that it’s also the passage with the simplest and most eloquently plainspoken lyrics. </p></div>"|19757.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19757-field-report-marigolden/|5.3|Stephen M.

Walker’s voice sweeps in with extreme operatic gusto, delivering a set of simple, sliding phrases over sparkling synthesizers. Dual classic rock riffs trail those hails, like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbm6GXllBiw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Paradise City”</a> abutting a scrap of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npoYQMPCOvU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Heartbreaker”</a>. And as it all fades toward silence, Greg Anderson and Stephen O’Malley shatter the creeping calm with their expected amplifier army. To emphasize the madness, the sound of an American bullwhip slaps at the back of the din. Yes, Scott O))) is real, and yes, it is a touch ridiculous.</p>
<p>In the wake of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15996-lou-reed-metallica/""><i>Lulu</i></a>, the intriguing but errant byproduct of a more famous elder leading a more famous metal act, such a partnership felt like a joke someone might have made on a message board in 2011. Gabriel and Mastodon? Jagger and Down? Walker and Sunn O)))? Sure, line them up, but don’t assume that they will all net <i>Lulu</i>’s Warner Brothers deal. At least there was stylistic precedent for this hypothetical pairing. Though Walker was once a pop star, his work later in life has been experimentally ambitious, adding webs of dissonance to song cycles that explored discontent in dozens of guises. Even now, his 1995 LP, <i>Tilt</i>, seems diabolically heavy and jarring, employing unease as compositional exigency. Released only seven months apart, his 2006 album, <i>The Drift</i>, and Sunn O)))’s <i>Black One</i>, feel now like complementary surveys of the same seismic divide. Walker originally wrote “Lullaby,” <i>Soused</i>’s jarring and arching climax, in 1999. His music doesn’t fear the dark.</p>
<p>As legend has it, Sunn O))) approached Walker a half-decade ago with a blind call for collaboration. He’d never heard them, but they hoped he’d pen something to sing for “Alice”, the orchestra-gilded finale of their 2009 LP, <i>Monoliths &amp; Dimensions</i>. He didn’t, but he did become a convert to the band’s maximum-volume, minimum-movement metal. He began writing new material with Anderson, O’Malley and, it seems, both their instrumental and thematic tones in mind. Together, they recorded those pieces earlier this year in London, with several of Walker’s more customary contributors adding drums, horns, keyboards and electronics.</p>
<p><i>Soused </i>is billed to “Scott Walker + Sunn O))),” an ostensible meeting of equals. On T-shirts, the project is even playfully dubbed Scott O))), written in the same lower-cased, bold-faced font that the electronics company and drone duo have long used. And as is his wont, O’Malley designed the packaging for <i>Soused</i>, an austere grayscale colossus guided by a system of holistic organization.</p>
<p>But the music itself never tries to sell the conspiracy of equal and reciprocal collaboration. Sure, Sunn O))) made the first move here, but any real work required Walker’s acceptance and effort. This is, then, a Scott Walker album, where Sunn O)))—Anderson, O’Malley and longtime multi-instrumentalist and collaborator TOS Nieuwenhuizen—serve as a very large, potent instrument within Walker’s band, or maybe a set of them, like a rack of guitars pulled from a closet. During “Brando”, they follow him, saturating the background but almost always ceding the spotlight. When he sings “A beating would do me a world of good,” Anderson and O’Malley bend inside his shadow, taking the riff’s next step down.</p>
<p>Anderson and O’Malley even flash back to their high-school days in Thorr’s Hammer, or their subsequent separate bands, for “Fetish”, the album’s singular and brilliant flashpoint. Just before the song’s halfway point, they’ve traced Walker’s voice only with ominous noise and tracked him with mid-range melodies. “He imagines he feels it, tugging and clinching, hears it rustling and rising,” Walker yells, pausing suddenly as if to summon help. Sunn O))) answers, matching the beat of drummer Ian Thomas with loaded guitar and low-lying bass, like they’re an insurgent young doom band again, racing toward a crossover crescendo. Later in the track, they sprawl out beneath him, their amps and instruments harmonizing obediently alongside screeching trumpet, stuttering drums and stabbing static. They are, perhaps for the first time, part of a force greater than their own.</p>
<p>Sunn O)))’s career has been defined by their search for ways to augment their riffs, to make them bigger than simply big; but after 15 years and a half-dozen full-lengths, they’ve yet to take the routes through which Walker pulls them here. The only prototypically Sunn O))) moment arrives during the back half of “Bull,” when they cycle a slow set of notes across occasional percussion and over scrambled field recordings. But it’s mostly a mid-record volume respite, a break in the command of Walker’s stentorian elegance.</p>
<p><i>Soused</i> documents depravity and wanton desire, or needing something—pain or the absence of it, protection or the illusion of it, privacy or the desecration of it—so bad it’s ripping your worldview into pieces. Walker empties volumes of data into those ideas, pinballing between <a href=""http://musee-jacquemart-andre.com/en/events/rubens-poussin-and-17th-century-artists"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">17th century painting debates</a>, <a href=""http://www.biblearchaeology.org/post/2009/12/08/The-Slaughter-of-the-Innocents-Historical-Fact-or-Legendary-Fiction.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New Testament infanticide</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdFzSw1yehY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Iroquois lullabies</a> within the course of the shape-shifting “Herod 2014”. In less than a minute of “Bull”, he moves from a string of screamed Latin imprecations to a recited text message, reprinted in the liner notes as an<a href=""http://missig.org/julian/projects/jabber/iChat/msgsend2.png"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> iChat bubble</a>. During “Brando”, he details successive episodes in which <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the named actor </a>was beaten, shouting the elliptical list with an urgency that gives the sadomasochism a private power.</p>
<p>Though Walker was once a sort of balladeer icon, his lyrics trend toward the obtuse and ponderous. The words on <i>Soused</i> don’t forsake those qualities, necessarily, but there is a certain relatability and readability here, as if this return to rock ’n’ roll has pulled him back toward earth. Despite the macabre battle between the innocent and the hunter of “Herod 2014,” Walker delights in the language, using alliteration and end-rhyme to fashion what could pass for old-fashioned folklore. “The deer fly, the sand fly, the tsetse can’t find them,” he offers, his voice cold but comforting, like that of a wolf in disguise. “The goon from the Stasi  is left far behind them. Their delicate derma  won’t witness a ray.” In this new relationship, Walker seems to have rediscovered a sometimes-hidden element of his own work—its playfulness and its perversity, the coexistence of the smile and the frown.</p>
<p>Is it selfish, then, to hope that this might be only the start, the unlikely origin of a partnership that extends beyond a one-off album? Walker is, of course, <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/16411-scott-walker-interview-sunn-o-soused"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">infamously reluctant</a> to talk about his future in making music, and he can be rather chelonian with his output; much the same applies for Sunn O))), at its core a duo of dudes involved in a dozen other things. That’s one reason <i>Soused</i> feels more like an event and an experience than a vital, persevering record for either party. It’s good and, at times, completely absorbing, especially when Walker and the amplifiers seem to be fighting on the same side of a great battle. <i>Soused </i>is compelling, almost inherently so, but it’s not a classic. What if they gave this time to be more than a mere oddity, so as to feel no rush to launch from the gates and exclaim that this is, in fact, real? We’ll probably never find out, but we never thought we’d hear Scott O))), anyway. </p></div>"|19946.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19946-sunn-o-scott-walker-soused/|7.4|Grayson Haver Currin

Anyone who’s palled around an underground venue as a young adult might recall, with some reluctance, groups of uncouth youths self-described as 77ers looking to cause trouble, or at the very least, reaffirm all that’s dirty and fun about true punx living. (Like binge drinking, or knife crime.) The association is strange for Nude Beach, a three-piece rock band that’s more <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6071-mc5/"">MC5</a> than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5832-misfits/"">the Misfits</a> who have named their third album <i>77</i> and produced a double album—the type of excess that the punks would’ve sneered at.</p>
<p>Their nostalgia is more broad than specific. Pitchfork’s Steven Hyden described 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16962-ii/""><i>II</i></a> as hitting those familiar bar band touch points of “mid-period <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3559-the-replacements/"">Replacements</a>, early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/835-elvis-costello/"">Elvis Costello</a>, all-eras <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9474-tom-petty/"">Tom Petty</a>,” and much of that has stayed true the second time around. You could add bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"">Big Star</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/732-cheap-trick/"">Cheap Trick</a>, and the Buzzcocks, but why belabor the point? Bands like these are an inelastic good—as long as there are young men fueled by soft drugs and ennui, there will be songs that sound warmer with each depleted case of Keystone Light. The singing, which is handled by guitarist Chuck Betz and drummer Ryan Naideau, has two modes, screamer and slacker, and works best in the former. Not that their musing about being stuck in neutral doesn't evoke a certain wistful <i>je ne sais quoi</i>, but this “whatever’s good with me” attitude can get a little enervating. You’d rather hear someone explode.</p>
<p>Explode they do like “Yesterday” and “For a While” and “I Can’t Keep the Tears from Falling”, Betz’s guitar blaring brightly like an immaculately choreographed light display. “I Found You” is a particular standout—it’s the highway song War on Drugs would’ve written if their foot was mashed to the pedal. It sounds white hot, and obviously derivative, but it’s a good time. That’s where the band is most engaging, because their songwriting topics are blissfully generic; not that we all can’t empathize with the passing of time (“Time”) or the quest for love (“I Found You”), but the lyrics are rendered with such unspecific detail that they’re nearly anonymous. (Two exceptions: “The Witness”, which attempts to be conceptual, and the winsome “Geoffrey’s Tune”, a love song that appears to be sung toward another man, but could just as well be about a cat.) I mean: “It’s So Hard”, the eleventh track, is followed three songs later with “It’s So Hard to Love You”. Is there some thematic connective tissue? Well, sure, but Brecht it isn’t.</p>
<p>This would be less noticeable but for the fact that <i>77</i> is long; 18 tracks and 68 minutes, and you’d think that if a band insisted on staying around for so long they’d have more to say, or at least display more stylistic variation. Perhaps this is unfair; as they sing on “See My Way”, “It's okay/ You don’t have to see my way.” (That’s an endearing feature here: Song titles that get right to the point.) And maybe it’s not always bad to want to have a good time without keeping your eye on the clock. Why begrudge their vibe? Their name, Nude Beach, refers to a place so casual that what was once erotic or salacious is cleaved of its politics or ideology. A place where it’s perfectly okay to just hang out, where everyone can have fun without too much trouble.</p></div>"|19938.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19938-nude-beach-77/|6.9|Jeremy Gordon

Their rising success can be found in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/57009-mary-j-blige-records-right-now-with-disclosure-in-london-sessions-video/"">industry-shepherded superstar collaborations</a> and <a href=""http://thump.vice.com/words/disclosure-has-inspired-a-new-generation-of-listeners-and-producers-says-todd-edwards"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dance veteran co-signs</a>; they were also responsible for putting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31101-sam-smith/"">the most boring new pop star of the year</a> on the map. All of which has lead to the music industry’s typically craven search to find something, <i>anything</i> comparable when it comes to satiating the fuzzy-boots crowd’s sudden micro-thirst for vocal-driven house. It’s why UK producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16468-i-got-u-ft-jax-jones/"">Duke Dumont’s ebullient, bursting “I Got U”</a> could be found on U.S. pop radio earlier this summer, and it also explains why the market has been flooded with knockoffs supposedly meant to catch some of Disclosure’s heat. If you thought the glut of post-dubstep singer/songwriter types or tortured alt-R&amp;B auteurs proved tiring, the 4/4 onslaught that mainstream pop is about to undergo could prove even worse.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Recently, the market’s been hit with two new artists in the Disclosure mold: first, there was Gorgon City’s competent, ultimately ineffective debut LP <i>Sirens</i>, and now we have the debut album from Calgary's Kiesa Rae Ellestad, <i>Sound of a Woman</i>. Kiesza's earliest music leaned toward folk, and then she hooked up with producer and current collaborator Rami Samir Afuni, who has written and arranged for the likes of LMFAO and Miley Cyrus. In 2012, Kiesza and Afuni released the single “Oops”, a pop trifle about unprotected sex that mixed bright, MOR synth-pop with the requisite wub-wub elements that marked big-tent dance music at the time; at the top of this year, they hit the pop bullseye forcefully with “Hideaway”, a throaty blast that sounded like the duo’s attempt to remake Robin S.’ “Show Me Love” for the millennial crowd.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A minor U.S. hit that went platinum in four European countries, “Hideaway” was a stroke of low-level pop mimicry genius, and Kiesza and Afuni are clearly aware of its winning formula: <i>Sound of a Woman</i>, a record that proves as generic and bland as the catch-all title that adorns it, is largely made up of attempts to recreate that song’s success, right down to replicating its basic structure. Sometimes, this works: the effervescent “No Enemiesz” finds Kiesza shouting over squiggles and a hollow, pounding beat before hitting a chorus that utilizes her oversinging tendencies effectively, while “Giant in My Heart” blooms into a satisfying 4/4 pulse that carries superficial charms similar to off-brand cereal.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Elsewhere, though, <i>Sound of a Woman</i> fails to spark, as its homogenous textures blend together to rob this music of the personality and emotion it has when done right. Kiesza and Afuni treat house music with all the studiousness of someone reading a textbook, as evidenced by her sorta-viral, sacrilegiously po-faced cover of Haddaway’s “What Is Love”. On one level, they’ve committed cultural thievery of the laziest kind, right down to European dance culture’s obsession with dusty, pre-2000s hip-hop (the shiftless “Losin’ My Mind” and “Bad Thing”, with respective features by American rappers Mick Jenkins and Joey Bada$$). Kiesza and Afuni come across as guests at a dinner party who couldn’t be bothered to bring anything and expect their presence to do the work for them.</p>
<p class=""p1"">So <i>Sound of a Woman</i>’s most memorable moments are when the duo deviate from their established norm: “So Deep” is a brooding, bleeping slow jam that, midway through, breaks into a moderately appealing 2step rhythm, while ""Piano” soothes and swerves with the druggy melancholy of certain strains of R&amp;B, building to a pleading, drum-assisted chorus that wouldn’t have sounded out of place on Jessie Ware’s 2012 debut <i>Devotion</i>. They’re capable, pretty songs, and like the rest of <i>Sound of a Woman, </i>they don’t give any clues as to who Kiesza is. </p></div>"|19933.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19933-kiesza-sound-of-a-woman/|5.2|Larry Fitzmaurice

Over the last decade the Portland chamber-folk group, led by singer-songwriter Justin Ringle, has perfected a gently gothic sound reliant on stringed instruments, painstaking compositions, and muted emotions, as though in direct opposition to the strummy histrionics of the Lumineers and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28595-mumford-sons/"">Mumford &amp; Sons</a>. There’s always been something dignified in Horse Feathers’ restraint, even if that didn’t make them an especially exciting band to follow. And the wear of so many depressive tunes apparently began to weigh on Ringle, who followed up the tour for 2012’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16545-cynics-new-year/"">Cynic’s New Year</a></i> with an 18-month hiatus from music.</p>
<p>That break was productive, as <i>So It Is With Us</i> finds Horse Feathers tinkering with new sounds, major keys, faster tempos, and different emotional textures. There are even drums here. So, all things being relative, “Violently Wild” is certainly the most violently wild the band has ever been. Rather than mopey, Ringle’s vocals are heraldic. The music is more celebratory than mournful. The rhythm section sounds like it can actually hold a groove and make the song a kinetic show opener or closer. It’s a joyful noise: Horse Feathers perform the song like they’ve just discovered a new superpower.</p>
<p>On each of their four previous albums, all except debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9689-words-are-dead/""><i>Words Are Dead</i></a> released on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=kill+rock+stars"">Kill Rock Stars</a>, Horse Feathers have emphasized rigid song structures and careful arrangements that blend guitar, violin, cello, and voice into melancholy rural song suites. Broadening the tone of the music has opened up new possibilities, which means Horse Feathers play more like a band and less like a Ringle solo project. Their palette is more expansive and more ambitious, drawing elements from tango and doo-wop, jazz and '50s pop. They plays songs like “Old Media” and “Small Melody” with real enthusiasm. “Dead End Thanks” in particular thrums with energy, as Nathan Crockett’s violin spirals around Dustin Dybvig’s piano and pulls the song in unexpected directions.</p>
<p>This is still a Horse Feathers album, which means that underneath the liveliness lurks the same darkness that has informed all of the group’s material. “We’re out of tune, you’ll be gone, and I’ll be leaving soon,” Ringle promises on the sing-along chorus to “Violently Wild”, singing darkly of marriage and commitment and the inevitable end that quells all arguments. Throughout his tenure, Ringle has written eloquently—sometimes too eloquently—about gnawing disaffection and thwarted desires, but the relative sunniness of the music on <i>So It Is With Us</i> suggests higher stakes: The dark makes the lighter sound lighter, and the light makes the dark sound darker.</p>
<p>“Tell me why do you try hangin’ on?” Ringle asks on “Why Do I Try” sounding like a man who might just stop. It’s arguably the most downcast song on the album, as he wonders about the fate of his children, yet it’s one of the band’s most subtly adventurous arrangements. Ringle lays down sharp staccato guitar licks that summon Steve Cropper, and the band moves with a steadiness that gives the song a hymnlike feel, at least until the woozy piano comes in like the ghost of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15153-buddy-holly/"">Buddy Holly</a>. As Ringle hits the high notes on the bridge, the song reveals itself as Pacific Northwest soul—which is something completely unexpected from Horse Feathers and a fine answer to the song’s central question. He sounds like a man with renewed faith.</p></div>"|19914.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19914-horse-feathers-so-it-is-with-us/|7.4|Stephen M. Deusner

But most don’t hold a torch to Menace Ruine. Not that the Montreal-based duo comes off in any way traditional; on albums such as 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17127-alight-in-ashes/""><i>Alight in Ashes</i></a>, singer/keyboardist Geneviève Beaulieu soaks her ancient-reaching plainsong in vats of boiling noise and a thickened black-metal reduction. Recently, her voice has taken on varying shades of mysticism in her side project <a href=""http://preterite.bandcamp.com/album/from-the-wells"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Preterite</a>, as well as her chilling appearance on James Blackshaw’s 2012 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16527-love-is-the-plan-the-plan-is-death/""><i>Love Is the Plan, the Plan Is Death</i></a>. Aided by instrumentalist/producer S. de La Moth, Beaulieu has delivered the sixth and latest Menace Ruine album, <i>Venus Armata</i>—and while it doesn’t vastly expand the band’s mist-shrouded domain, it’s a potent elixir of Dark Ages alchemy and modern experimentalism.</p>
<p><i>Venus Armata</i>’s seven songs are split almost evenly between somewhat prettier and slightly more horrifying. Any overt gestures toward metal, black or otherwise, have been jettisoned on “Red Sulphur”, in which Beaulieu’s sacrificial chants coil around gulping organ drones like serpents around a scepter. The percussion is synthetic and martial, but it’s draped in enough mid-fi gauze to make it seem half alive. That liminal state of being is more eerily evoked in “Soothing but Cruel”. Where “Red Sulphur” carries a sylvan, romanticized folk air, “Soothing but Cruel” is grinding, oscillatory, and proto-industrial—shards of distortion splinter and stab as Beaulieu trills in a lilting tongue that sounds simultaneously ancestral and alien. That paradox seeps into every fiber of <i>Venus Armata</i>, from Beaulieu’s rickety, looped-calliope keys to the modal circularity and  sonorous portent of her melodies. If Nostradamus had spoken through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3039-nico/"">Nico</a>, the result might have resembled “Venus Armata,” the album’s 16-minute, grimoire-worthy title track.</p>
<p>Whatever occult undertones <i>Venus Armata</i> may possess, they’re sliced open and laid bare across “Soften Our Evil Hearts” and “Belly of the Closed House”. Both are saga-length, incantatory meditations, but their shrillness is distilled into an icy shimmer that’s more visceral than spiritual. Beaulieu’s stained-glass voice is layered on top of its own ghost on “Soften Our Evil Hearts”, forming an unholy fugue, although that echoed distance isn’t as riveting as her intimate performance on “Marriage in Death”. Amid slow-motion bursts of dissonance and space, her voice wanders like a lost soul. At 9 barely modulated minutes, in never seems to end, and that purgatorial stasis says more about marriage and death as ritualistic constructs than it does about their everyday reality. Not that Menace Ruine would ever stoop to the mundane. On <i>Venus Armata</i>’s most spine-tingling song, “Torture of Fire”, Beaulieu bleats beatifically, while a plodding, ominous beat throbs behind her like an onrushing apocalypse. When she pauses, there’s no mercy to it. It’s just a chance for the bleak, acidic static to foam up to the forefront.</p>
<p>In an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/7527-show-no-mercy/"">interview</a> in 2008, Beaulieu spoke expectantly of a planned collaboration with Merzbow that has yet to surface. Strangely enough, each Menace Ruine album since that time has inched closer to imagining what exactly such a collaboration might look like. That’s not to say <i>Venus Armata</i> is anywhere near as skull-rattling or hermetically exacting as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2744-merzbow/"">Merzbow</a>; if anything, the album’s closest alignment is with Beaulieu’s fellow-traveling singer/keyboardist, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2168-jarboe/"">Jarboe</a>. But Beaulieu’s narrow scope—in essence, hurdy-gurdy-like hymns manifested as post-industrial ambience—is blown out to cosmological proportions. There are universes bottled inside <i>Venus Armata</i>, or at least Beaulieu and de La Moth play as if there are, and the reverence with which they funnel their awe is downright liturgical. <i>Venus Armata</i> doesn’t stand on ceremony; it drowns itself in it.</p></div>"|19749.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19749-menace-ruine-venus-armata/|7.4|Jason Heller

Russell supposedly left behind something like a thousand tapes, many of them not-quite-finished recordings or variations on particular songs, when he died from AIDS-related complications in 1992. He was one of the great geniuses of New York City music—a brilliant melodist and even better catalyst who brought together the Downtown experimental music scene, the disco world, and the singer/songwriter tradition. And, as beautiful as his solo voice-and-cello recordings are, he also thrived on giving collaborators raw material to explore and shape: the long list of artists with whom he recorded includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"">Talking Heads</a>, Allen Ginsberg, François Kevorkian, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31150-peter-gordon/"">Peter Gordon</a>.</p>
<p>All of that suggests that his music would make for a hell of a tribute album, which is true of this double-CD set–a half that consists of covers of the songs that <i>were</i> more or less open-ended when Russell recorded them. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/"">Robyn</a>'s take on ""Tell You (Today)"", a giddy disco jam by Russell's short-lived group Loose Joints, concentrates it from a seven-minute sprawl to a 3:45 pop shimmer; she sings it like it's her favorite song in the world, even stumbling over a line exactly the way Loose Joints' Joyce Bowden did. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"">Hot Chip</a> approach ""Go Bang"" as a set of modular components rather than a stable composition—arguably the same way Russell treated it when he recorded it with Dinosaur L—and arrange them into a big tent to hold a disco party inside.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29639-blood-orange/"">Blood Orange</a> goes even further in that direction, attempting to hybridize bits of Loose Joints' disco classic ""Is It All Over My Face"" and Russell's orchestral piece ""Tower of Meaning"". It doesn't quite jell, but it's at least in the spirit of Russell's own why-not attitude. There's a previously unreleased song included here, too: Ernie Brooks (who played with Russell in the Flying Hearts), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30449-peter-zummo/"">Peter Zummo</a> (who recorded minimalist instrumental music with him), and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5601-liam-finn/"">Liam Finn</a>'s contribution to <i>Master Mix</i> is the exquisite ""This Love Is Crying"", which they picked up from an old rehearsal tape.</p>
<p>Russell's recordings are enormously idiosyncratic, and a lot of <i>Master Mix</i>'s contributors try to normalize his music: sanding off his bristling electric cello tones, hammering repeated phrases into choruses, singing with dramatic intonation in place of his ethereal reserve. (The major exception is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31946-lonnie-holley/"">Lonnie Holley</a>, whose four brief ""interludes"" here abstract Russell pieces further.) That often works just fine, surprisingly. Russell's ""Eli"" was a rhythmless, wounded shout into the darkness; the version by Rubblebucket and Nitemoves doubles its duration, snaps it to a foursquare beat, replaces the cello with misty rock instrumentation, and ends up recalling mid-'80s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"">Cocteau Twins</a>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10015-sam-amidon"">Sam Amidon</a> tweaks <i>World of Echo</i>'s stream-of-consciousness piece ""Lucky Cloud"" into something that might be sung around a campfire rather than murmured alone in a dark forest. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4063-scissor-sisters"">Scissor Sisters</a>' ""That's Us/Wild Combination"" slicks up and modernizes the arrangement from Russell's <i>Calling Out of Context</i>, emphasizing how similar it is to their own music.</p>
<p>Where this collection falters is in its second half, with a string of artists covering Russell's more straightforward songs—the three-minute guitar-pop tunes that mostly ended up on his posthumous collection <i>Love Is Overtaking Me</i>. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5983-glen-hansard/"">Glen Hansard</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30979-thao-the-get-down-stay-down/"">Thao &amp; the Get Down Stay Down</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/176-the-autumn-defense/"">the Autumn Defense</a> perform Russell's songs precisely as their author did, in the same key and at the same tempo, without singing them quite as elegantly. Those are the sort of ""tributes"" that are purely gestural, honoring songs by showing up for them rather than by reshaping them. But one of the things that made Russell's work special (and, arguably, kept him from completing so much of it) was his conviction that there was always more to discover within it.</p></div>"|19833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19833-various-artists-master-mix-red-hot-arthur-russell/|7.3|Douglas Wolk

Sure, it doesn’t quite roll off the tongue like <i>Queen II</i>, <i>Zeppelin III</i>, or <i>Chicago 17</i>. But, 20 years into their rollercoaster run, Trail of Dead can wear that nine like a badge of honor, considering there was a time when it didn’t look like they would make it far past album number three. And though bandleader Conrad Keely <a href=""http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4148349-trail-of-deads-track-by-track-guide-to-new-album-ix"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has said</a> the new album’s title is really just a reference to a planet featured in Frank Herbert’s <i>Dune</i>, it nonetheless speaks volumes about the band’s current state—like the very Roman numeral that comprises it, <i>IX</i> suggests the arrival at a crossroads. At this point, Trail of Dead have lived out every narrative in the rock'n'roll playbook: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...And_You_Will_Know_Us_by_the_Trail_of_Dead_(album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the promising debut</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_(...And_You_Will_Know_Us_by_the_Trail_of_Dead_album)#cite_note-2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the real-deal follow-up</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/178-source-tags-and-codes/"">the career peak</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/182-worlds-apart/"">the spectacular crash</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9630-so-divided/"">the failure to relaunch</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12703-the-century-of-self/"">the reconstruction</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15101-tao-of-the-dead/"">the encouraging show of strength</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17220-lost-songs/"">the valiant return to form</a>. But where their discography to date has seen violent swings from discordant punk to lavish prog and back again, with <i>IX</i>, they opt to let the pendulum rest gently in the middle.</p>
<p>Trail of Dead’s current four-piece lineup—instrument-swapping co-founders Keely and Jason Reece, plus bassist Autry Fulbright II and guitarist/drummer Jamie Miller—has been in place for almost as long as their name-making 1998-2003 formation. And after two albums (2011’s <i>Tao of the Dead</i> and 2012’s <i>Lost Songs</i>) that reinstituted Trail of Dead’s primordial crash-and-burn guitar carnage, with <i>IX</i>, the solidified band is feeling confident enough to take another stab at the cinemascopic, candelabra-lit pop that defined Trail of Dead’s muddled mid-period output, but this time with a lesson-learned sense of restraint. So while <i>IX</i> sees Trail of Dead rolling out the piano and enlisting a string section once again (the album contains not one, but two interstitial chamber-rock crash-endos), in this case, the ornate touch-ups don’t come at the expense of the band’s roiling energy.</p>
<p>It takes the band a few tries to get the balance just right—<i>IX</i> opens with a trio of mid-tempo guitar-churning, drum-thundering tracks that are too controlled to fully erupt, and too heavy-handed to showcase their melodic graces. (In particular, “Jaded Apostles” sees Keely adopting a theatrically overwrought vocal to infuse the song with an intensity that its lumbering, Celtic-reeled gallop can’t muster.) But <i>IX</i> gradually loosens up and simmers down without diminishing its dramatic intent: the careening “Lie Without a Liar” and “The Dragonfly Queen” pledge allegiance to the “(Don’t Fear) The Reaper”/”So. Central Rain (I'm Sorry)” school of sinister jangle-pop; “The Ghost Within” is a celestial ballad in the vein of <i>Madonna</i>’s “Clair de Lune” or “Sigh Your Children”, and a reminder that behind Trail of Dead’s apocalyptic attack beats the bruised heart of a mid-’90s emo act (and there’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/325-evan-weiss-emo-revival/"">no better time than now</a> to reapply it on their sleeves). And in contrast to the cultural critiques that formed the conceptual framework of their most recent records, <i>IX</i> feels like a more personal work, focusing on intimate exchanges that better suit its more refined presentation. Most affecting is centerpiece track “Bus Lines”, wherein Trail of Dead’s fantastical, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM_zVtrLaI0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">globe-spanning</a> universe gets distilled to a simple, poignant portrait of backpack travel and homesickness, the song’s pent-up emotion unleashed in a <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16059-gish-deluxe-edition-siamese-dream-deluxe-edition/"">Siamese Dream</a>-</i>y coda of phased-guitar fireworks.</p>
<p>That towering climax serves as the launch-pad into <i>IX</i>’s more epically scaled home stretch, with Reece’s jugular-bulging “Lost in the Grand Scheme” reverting to Trail of Dead’s familiar pattern of firing up, flaming out, and rekindling for an even bigger bang. But the closing “Sound of the Silk” proves a more slippery beast than its sunrise-summoning psych-pop initially suggests, leading us through a drum-circle breakdown and spoken-word change-up en route to a fierce finale that sees Keely and Reece locking into a call-and-response clamor. In essence, the song is Trail of Dead’s entire discography condensed into an “in case you missed it” highlight reel of paisley-patterned melody, jammed-out indulgence, and steroid-pumped punk. While the band may have struggled in the past to reconcile their post-hardcore roots with their art-rock ambitions<i>, </i>more often than not, <i>IX</i> marks the spot. </p></div>"|19859.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19859-and-you-will-know-us-by-the-trail-of-dead-ix/|7.2|Stuart Berman

Then in July, a second artifact was <a href=""http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/181469207601"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">discovered</a> in a warehouse: a 1985 album called <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19697-lewis-romantic-times/"">Romantic Times</a></i>, credited to Lewis Baloue. When Light in the Attic reissued that, they also <a href=""http://blog.lightintheattic.net/?p=28161"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">claimed</a> to have found the man himself, or at least someone who looks like a decades-older version of the suave gent who graced those '80s album covers.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Even before that encounter, rumors circulated about more Lewis recordings, made under the name Randy Duke in the late '90s at a studio near Vancouver called </span><a href=""http://www.fiascobros.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Fiasco Bros</span></a><span>. An engineer named Len Osanic confirmed these were indeed by Lewis/Wulff, and recently </span><a href=""http://www.fiascobros.com/lewis_randy_duke.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>released</span></a><span> some of them digitally as a 12-track album called </span><i>Love Ain’t No Mystery</i><span>, later licensing them to Summersteps Records for a cassette with three additional songs. Since the voice on these tapes is unmistakably that of the man who made </span><i>L’Amour </i><span>and </span><i>Romantic Times</i><span>, and Osanic says the release is approved (he’s been friends with Wulff since the early '00s), it seems fair to call this the third Lewis album.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In many ways, though, </span><span><i>Love Ain’t No Mystery</i> </span><span>occupies a different universe than its predecessors. Where '80s Lewis was smooth as silk—an enigmatic soft-rock savant—'90s Lewis is raw and direct. His subject matter is still love, but he’s shifted from seduction and romance to heartbreak and loss, and he wants to tell you about it without filters. Hence the music is much sparser: just voice and guitar, without the synths and beats that added texture to</span><i> L’Amour </i><span>and </span><i>Romantic Times</i><span>. Lewis’ singing retains a shy, retreating quality, but it’s much higher in the mix, and where his voice once could disappear, it now rarely takes breaks. He massages phrases obsessively and repeats lines like mantras, as if he can find answers by asking the same question over and over. (Osanic</span><a href=""http://the13thtrack.tumblr.com/post/95201438250/mystery-man"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span> claims</span></a><span> Lewis often spent hours making subtly different variations of songs, sitting silent for 10 minutes before starting each one.)</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This tireless repetition, combined with the fact that Summersteps’ cassette lasts almost 90 minutes, makes </span><span><i>Love Ain’t No Mystery</i> </span><span>an endurance test. Most songs cross the 6-minute mark and feel longer; at their most hypnotic, they’re as fascinating as infinity, but in other places they just feel endless. The closest parallel to Lewis’ approach here is the lonely, damaged blues of </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5849-jandek/""><span>Jandek</span></a><span>, or perhaps the stretched melodrama of later-period </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker/""><span>Scott Walker</span></a><span>. But Lewis doesn’t venture as far out as either; he never sounds like he’s going off the deep end or even staring over its edge. Oddly, this makes </span><span><i>Love Ain’t No Mystery</i></span><span> prone to tedium, since there’s not a lot of unpredictability in terms of song structure. Once you hear the first few musical phrases of a given track, you pretty much know what you’re in for the rest of the way.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The many moods Lewis conjures with his vocals, however, are harder to peg. He continually pushes and pulls his voice until it quivers and cracks, abandoning conventional notions of pitch or melody if they get in the way of expressing emotion. But he also knows how to hold back, how to hint and suggest rather than yell, even when he’s not whispering. So the halting, vaporous “I Was Not Shy” takes an opposite angle from the hoarse, distorted blues of “I Come From Texas”, but both arrive at convincingly geniuine feelings.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The variety in Lewis’ singing is especially impressive given how close and unprotected it sounds. According to Osanic, Lewis set up mics “</span><span>so he could 'work' them by moving closer and sideways as if he was whispering in someones ear,” and even wore a special shirt that made the least possible noise when he shifted around. (Stories like that make you understand why some suggest the whole Lewis story is a hoax.) </span><span>But the relentless in-your-ear aura doesn’t limit Lewis’ ability to convey feelings; in fact, it seems to enhance it.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-acf6117b-f528-ce8b-8be4-3211a1d6722a""><span>All that compelling emotion is what connects </span><i>Love Ain’t No Mystery </i><span>to </span><i>L’Amour </i><span>and </span><i>Romantic Times</i><span>, and shows their peculiar, mesmerizing accomplishments were no flukes. Those two previous records are stronger works: subtler, more complete, weaving vocals and music into a richer whole. But even when his tactics are more simplistic, Randy Wulff knows how to turn feelings into music, and that makes the discovery of </span><i>Love Ain’t No Mystery</i><span> a valuable one.</span></span></p></div>"|19915.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19915-lewis-love-aint-no-mystery/|6.6|Marc Masters

Is it better to turn your band’s entire body of work into one extended Marxist metaphor, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1677-gang-of-four/"">Gang of Four</a>, or to embody a post-capitalist ideal of pop without openly acknowledging the injustice of the here-and-now, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4116-scritti-politti/"">Scritti Politti</a>? <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9376-the-pop-group/"">The Pop Group</a> wanted it both ways—and for a brief time, they had it. The British band’s two studio albums, 1979’s <i>Y </i>and 1980’s <i>For How Much Longer Do We Tolerate Mass Murder?</i>, upped the agit-funk panic while dipping into the slithery, ambiguous depths of dub nebulosity. Frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4130-mark-stewart/"">Mark Stewart</a> penned leftist screeds, then he babbled and screeched them so hideously that they ripped themselves to pieces. It was up to the listener to reassemble the shreds and try to make sense of them, even as the brunt of their meaning was as clear as any <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11831-crass/"">Crass</a> anthem.</p>
<p>The Pop Group released a third and final full-length before breaking up in 1981, but it wasn’t a studio album per se. <i>We Are Time</i> came out in 1980, and it’s being reissued sans bonus tracks or anything else by way of bells and whistles. That is, unless you count<i> Cabinet of Curiosities</i>, a brand new collection of odds-and-ends that might as well be <i>We Are Time: Part II</i>. In the same way <i>We Are Time</i> does, <i>Cabinet of Curiosities</i> gathers random studio cuts, live versions, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5977-john-peel/"">Peel Sessions</a> recordings; the official studio versions of those songs originally appear on singles, <i>Y</i>, or <i>For How Much Longer</i>, while others are exhumed legitimately for the first time via <i>Cabinet of Curiosities</i>. In that sense, both collections are important: a few gaps are filled, some hard-to-find tracks are unearthed, and a tragically abbreviated discography is fleshed out. That said, neither album substantively buttresses <i>Y</i> or <i>For How Much Longer</i>, let alone threatens to knock them over.</p>
<p><i>We Are Time </i>has always felt like an admittedly big footnote to the Pop Group’s catalog, and while that hasn’t changed with this bare-minimum reissue, the album’s bursts of brilliance still sear. “Colour Blind” is one of 4 songs that were recorded as a demo not long after the band formed in 1978, and it’s an astounding statement; this is the closest the sarcastically named Pop Group ever came to playing actual pop, and the song’s loping, cavity-riddled rhythm is smoothed over by Stewart’s gluey melody and a sweet-verse-acidic-chorus dynamic. It’s astounding how, almost 40 years later, it not only sounds more sophisticated than most post-punk circa ’78, but also eerily contemporary. </p>
<p>That can’t be said of the entirety of <i>We Are Time</i>. Another demo recording, “Trap”, is piercing, punky, and smeared with schoolboy conceits (“Burn all my books, page by page/ Cut my flesh with a paper edge”), but it’s also pitched down the middle of the post-punk plate. For all its anxious stiffness, it’s incredibly impassioned and perversely double-jointed; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6048-minutemen/"">Minutemen</a> cited the Pop Group as a major influence, and “Trap” is solid proof of that. The live tracks are serviceable, and show off the band’s formidable improv chops, but the savage version of “Thief of Fire” misses the cooling counterbalance and atmospheric flourishes of Dennis Bovell’s dub production on <i>Y</i>, which also presaged Stewart's post-Pop Group direction in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32253-new-age-steppers/"">New Age Steppers</a>, as a solo artist, and collaborating with everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30551-adrian-sherwood/"">Adrian Sherwood</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15484-daddy-g/"">Daddy G</a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_Rc8e1vXB8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Factory Floor</a>.</p>
<p><i>Cabinet of Curiosities </i>is the brand-new bookend to the decades-old <i>We Are Time</i>, but seeing as how it draws from the same well of peripheral material, it comes up shorter. That gulf is exemplified by the inclusion of an alternate studio version of the Pop Group’s most famous song, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkD_uV9DMto"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“She Is Beyond Good and Evil”</a>. It’s billed here as the “Original Version Previously Unreleased,” and it differs only slightly from the single/album version that’s become one of post-punk’s most durable manifestos (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"">St. Vincent</a>’s bracing, faithful <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JySQE4axlJY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover</a> performed on ""Late Night With Jimmy Fallon"" in 2011 demonstrates just how prescient the Pop Group’s vision was). The <i>Cabinet</i> version, though, has lower highs and higher lows; Stewart doesn’t whoop or whisper as much, and the cavernous aura that places the song in the same realm as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2494-liquid-liquid/"">Liquid Liquid</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/245-a-certain-ratio/"">a Certain Ratio</a> is nowhere near as huge.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it’s great to hear “Where There’s a Will”, the band’s half of a 1980 split with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4113-the-slits/"">the Slits</a> (with whom the Pop Group shared a drummer); its sculptural disco, free-jazz sax, and pious debt to Parliament’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImI78s638hQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof Off the Sucker)”</a> hit harder than ever. The live tracks and Peel Sessions of songs that first appeared on proper albums and singles are again inessential, although that’s offset by in-concert recordings of two Pop Group songs that are previously unreleased in any form: “Abstract Heart” and “Karen’s Car”. The former lunges along on throbbing bass and a fractured jazziness, even if its swagger is hamstrung by all the jarring shifts, noodling fusion solos, and an atypically lackluster set of lyrics from Stewart. The latter is a bit better, at least compositionally; there are some intriguing ideas sticking out at odd angles from the feverish jam. Unfortunately it’s the one live track on either <i>Cabinet</i> or <i>We Are Time</i> that suffers from a muddy, unforgiving recording.</p>
<p>If the Pop Group can be faulted for anything, it’s that Stewart’s precocious ambition was always a half step ahead of the band itself. That’s most dramatically heard on <i>We Are Time</i>’s “Amnesty Report II” and <i>Cabinet of Curiosities</i>’ “Amnesty Report III”. Both are variations on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEloVje7gR4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Amnesty International Report on British Army Torture of Irish Prisoners”</a>, the B-side of the band’s second single, 1979’s “We Are All Prostitutes”. The original version is a noise-collage scramble of static, voices, and the rubble of riffs; despite its challenging sound (and sidelong glance at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"">Throbbing Gristle</a> in regard to both sound and title), it’s the most artlessly preachy song the Pop Group ever made. “II” is more coherent than the single version, but it still feels likes a sketch; “III” is simply a different mix, and one that doesn’t fulfill any purpose other than fill out <i>Cabinet</i>’s already skimpy, nine-track span.</p>
<p>The most disappointing thing about <i>Cabinet </i>is that it’s being released as a standalone album, when really it warrants little more than being bonus tracks on the <i>We Are Time</i> reissue. That doesn’t detract from the undimmed impact of these recordings after all this time. The Pop Group were unique among the major post-punk bands, able and willing to clench up and cut loose with equal force—and to thread polemic into dream-logic poetry. The reissue of <i>We Are Time</i> and the release of <i>Cabinet of Curiosities</i> don’t diminish that fact, but they don’t amplify it much either. </p></div>"|19759.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19759-the-pop-group-we-are-timecabinet-of-curiosities/|7.5|Jason Heller

This odd, captivating EP is a 19-minute blast of uncontrolled kinetic energy and sonic non-sequiturs; the individual pieces of<b> </b>its seven interlocking tracks collide and scatter like a game of jacks in zero gravity. It might be the <i>boingiest</i> thing you'll hear all year. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Maybe one of the most cryptic, too. On a <a href=""http://doves.asia"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a> accompanying the release, alongside an acrostic treatise on the physics of dropped tennis balls, or ""falling doves,"" there's a strange sort of fashion editorial involving makeup brushes, a crimping iron, charm bracelets, glitter, purple freckles, a garden snail crawling across a young woman's face, and, perhaps most confusingly, an oversized piece of pita bread worn like a falconer's protective sleeve. Styled in a Palermo soccer jersey and staring intently at a magic tennis ball as elven sparks fly about her face, Tinkerbell style, the model comes across like a kind of Duchampian guerrilla for the age of Amazon reviews—a DIY warrior of the consumerist surreal.</p>
<p class=""p1"">If this all sounds a lot like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31081-sophie"">Sophie</a>, GFOTY, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/485-pc-music/"">the label/collective/phenomenon known as PC Music</a>, that would seem not to be merely coincidental. According to a representative for Gum Artefacts, the new label responsible for this record, Felicita frequently DJs with PC Music's A. G. Cook and even has his own project on that label, under a different, and undisclosed, name. One guess would be that it's Lipgloss Twins, not just for the shared interest in cosmetics (and apparently <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/snail-facials-use-slime-for-anti-aging-skin-care/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">snail facials</a> are a real thing, by the way) but also the spring-loaded zaniness of both projects, with their holographic sheen and rhythms that ricochet like weaponized Flubber. Coincidence or no, Felicita's warped pitch and funhouse-mirror atmospherics also bear a strong resemblance to the queasy textures  of GFOTY's ""Secret Mix"" and ""Don't Wanna / Let's Do It"".</p>
<p class=""p1"">From the moment the needle hits the record—and yes, unlike most PC Music-related output so far, this one actually comes on vinyl, and bright yellow vinyl at that—it's clear that this is a new world. A strange world, where the usual laws of physics don't apply. ""Doves"" begins like crashing through the ceiling into a tearoom filled with rubber duckies. Chattering voices, sped up to a cartoonish jibber, give way to carousel melodies, nonsense chants, splashing water, clucking tongues. The music lurches to and fro in fits and starts, its motion alternately checked by percussive outbursts and lubricated by angelic coos. ""Skip Blush"" sounds like an audioanimatronic tribute to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/280-derek-bailey/"">Derek Bailey</a> that's been hacked by conflicted poptimists. It's all pings and squeaks and elastic little hiccups cribbed from a ruthlessly plastic universe, and it creaks like a set of braces being tightened. ""Climb Up Eh"" pairs Rapunzel-inspired spoken lyrics (""My hair is black, climb up it/ Come up to the window, climb up it"") with see-sawing slide flute melodies and cacophonous clacks and shrieks. </p>
<p class=""p1"">And that's just the A-side: the B-side, equally thrilling and exhausting, manages to cover classical flute and brutalist 808 kicks (""When You Get Home"", one of the record's highlights); mercurial sino-grime (""Wish"", sounding a little like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a> on really terrifying designer drugs); and erratic snare flam and mournfully plucked acoustic guitar (the closing ""Bring It"", which suggests a copy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a>'s <i>Rhythms, Resolutions &amp; Clusters</i> with a terminal case of bit rot). And then there's ""MMMHM"", an unsettling clusterfuck of fist-mashed synthesizers, glass-blown glissandi, and squeaky refrains (""Jiggle jiggle lick it!/ Jiggle jiggle lick it!"") that sound like a cheerleading squad come perilously unhinged. It is not a pleasant thing to listen to, exactly, but then, I'm not sure it's supposed to be; neither was a lot of powerviolence, for example, and ""MMMHM"" may be just as confrontational, in its own, pipsqueak way. Here, instead of volume, unease is the primary weapon, and that goes for the entire record. It tickles and discomforts in equal measure—just like a snail tracing a glittery path up your cheek. </p></div>"|19739.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19739-felicita-frenemies-ep/|7.7|Philip Sherburne

This delicate balance is lightning-bolt brilliance that may not even strike once in a career for most artists, but Jessie Ware has made the balance appear effortless several times already in her young career, a talented pop vocalist who projects an interesting taste in music and a canny know-how in regards to the up-and-coming electronic producers she chooses to work with.</p>
<p>Ware's musical vision revolves around genuine curation and experimentation when it comes to sounds that don't appear as often in today's pop music landscape. Sure, there's plenty of divas who have embraced their quirky sides, from Kylie Minogue’s <i>Impossible Princess </i>to Madonna’s <i>Ray of Light </i>to Katy Perry’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4D5egXVqSg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two-minute preoccupation</a> with 1990s dance-pop vocalist CeCe Peniston last year. But rarely does a major-label pop singer sound as tasteful as Ware does, especially while avoiding the sleepy trappings of Adult Contemporary. At its best, Ware's music sounds truly exciting without sounding as if it's trying too hard to come across that way, and as such <i>Tough Love </i>isn’t packed with explicit experimentation. Following her excellent 2012 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16938-devotion/"" target=""_blank""><i>Devotion</i></a>, Ware is engaging with a variety of genres that stand to introduce her to new, different listeners with ears tuned to the mainstream. Some of these songs, like the midtempo disco banger “Want Your Feeling” or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28060-the-xx/"">the xx</a>-smacking “Sweetest Song”, properly fit Ware rather than coming across as the singer playing dress-up.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, top-40's hobbit du jour Ed Sheeran plays a key role with a co-writing credit on the swooning acoustic ballad “Say You Love Me”, a soulful and catchy number that nonetheless doesn't exactly reinvent the pop-music wheel. That's a fine enough standard for many singers who are not Ware, but her past work has suggested that she's better than that. The same could be said of the album’s most clichéd lyrical moment, the BenZel-produced “Champagne Kisses”, which sounds more like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30392-miguel/"">Miguel</a> B-side than the two <i>Tough Love</i> songs the R&amp;B singer actually contributed to—namely, the mushy “You &amp; I (Forever)” and sexting-my-exes anthem “Kind Of...Sometimes…Maybe”, the latter of which functions as the album's highlight.</p>
<p>Part of the increased variety on <i>Tough Love</i> stems from a more diverse array of collaborators, from producer Emile Haynie (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1339-eminem"">Eminem</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey"">Lana Del Rey</a>) to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29639-blood-orange"">Blood Orange</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32338-devonte-hynes/"">Devonté Hynes</a>; it's also due to a wider emotional range of lyrical themes, as well as an increased show of confidence on Ware’s part. Her music has moved past exuding the type of smoldering desire that borders just slightly on desperation, moving into the territory of real, messy love; accordingly, her vocal power throughout the album facilitates this shift, which speaks to her impressive versatility in this stage of her career. You get the sense that pretty much any style could be Ware’s if she commits to it, but for now it’s nice to hear her explore a level of sophistication as her star continues to rise. </p></div>"|19913.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19913-jessie-ware-tough-love/|7.3|Jillian Mapes

It is, however, the first time he’s released a song-oriented album under his own name since his highly publicized split from long-time wife/bandmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1763-kim-gordon/"">Kim Gordon</a>. And given that Moore’s traditionally used these solo albums to explore more intimate, emotionally resonant songcraft than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a>’s gnarled guitar jams normally accommodate, it’s not totally unreasonable to expect he’d use this opportunity to reflect upon the recent upheaval in his personal life in a more poetic way than contentious interview sound-bites allow.</p>
<p>But with Sonic Youth officially on indefinite—or is it infinite?—hiatus, <i>The Best Day</i> proves to be not so much a revelatory, introspective antidote to Moore’s best-known band as a serviceable, equally high-voltage substitute for it. The album may not approach the metal-meltdown extremes of last year’s one-off with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17766-chelsea-light-moving-chelsea-light-moving/"">Chelsea Light Moving</a>, but it does leave the drumstick-scraped guitars and humming amplifiers plugged in, displacing the acoustic quietude of 2007’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10681-trees-outside-the-academy/""><i>Trees Outside the Academy</i></a> and 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15474-demolished-thoughts/""><i>Demolished Thoughts</i></a> with a distinctly Sonic Youth-ian discord. </p>
<p>Now a London resident, Moore has built a backing band that’s a transatlantic mirror image of the Youth’s classic formation, complete with a certified queen-of-noise bassist in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a>’s Deb Googe and a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2057-lee-ranaldo/"">Lee Ranaldo</a>-esque guitarist foil (James Sedwards of long-running U.K. math-punk trio Nought) schooled in both classic-rock tradition and avant-garde experimentation. (Playing the role of drummer Steve Shelley is… Steve Shelley, who—given his unwavering Hoboken allegiances—is presumably being paid in frequent-flyer points.) As such, <i>The Best Day</i> proves to be more of a demonstration of this line-up’s intuitive dexterity than a snapshot of Moore’s inner psyche—it's not so much a break-up album as a celebration of breaking free.</p>
<p>Moore <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/thurston-moores-new-day-inside-his-upbeat-rock-roll-solo-album-20140911"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently told <i>Rolling Stone</i></a> that, from the album title to the quaint 1940s-era cover shot of his mom hugging a dog, <i>The Best Day</i> is an album steeped in positivity, with the implication that he’s having too much of a good time in his new life in England to dwell on the past. But it’s a contentment that’s not so much communicated in the lyrics—which adhere to a familiarly cryptic combination of street-hassle spiel and Catholic-block symbolism—as in the freewheeling spirit that permeates these recordings. (Ironically, the few acoustic-based songs that seem to speak most loudly to Moore’s personal preoccupations—like the cassette fetishism of “Tape” and the grrl-power solidarity statement ""Vocabularies”—actually feature lyrics penned by London-based poet Radieux Radio, with whom Moore previously collaborated on a 7''.)</p>
<p>Showing off his newly minted supergroup like a recently acquired sports car, Moore leads with his two most imposing, open-ended tracks: Clocking in at a respective eight and 11 minutes, “Speak to the Wild” and “Forevermore” bracingly announce Moore’s return to sprawling, Sonic Youth-scaled guitar odysseys, with an alluring, live-in-the-room ambience that makes it feel like you’re curling up on the pillow weighing down Shelley’s kick drum. But these colossal songs emphasize what separates this line-up from Sonic Youth as much as the similarities. Even when compared to the Youth’s more even-keeled post-2000s output, there’s an almost ominous steadiness to Shelley’s playing here, as he and Googe lay down a locomotive, locked-groove foundation for Moore and Sedwards' six-string entanglements that’s ultimately closer in spirit to CCR’s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93S_l0qZrXA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">extended “I Heard it Through the Grapevine” overhaul</a>.</p>
<p>The FM-radio flashbacks don’t end there: the only way to make the title track’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15997-keith-richards/"">Keith Richards </a>worship more obvious would be to call it “Stones” (had Moore not <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWpQHo1fygk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">already used that name a decade ago</a>), while even the stripped-down “Vocabularies” is centered around a chugging riff oddly reminiscent of “Smoke on the Water”. But while the loose, carefree nature of <i>The Best Day</i> supports Moore’s claim that he’s having “so much fun” playing with his new band, the top-heavy sequence gives the album a lopsided feel, with its two opening monster tracks establishing an immersive intensity that the shorter, scrappier songs in its wake never quite recapture. (Though “Grace Lake”, an instrumental that follows a similar chiming-to-churning course as way-underrated 1998 Sonic Youth epic “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hv6QWRAPPg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wildflower Soul</a>”, comes close.) Tellingly, in <a href=""http://www.northerntransmissions.com/interview/douglas-bleggi-interviews-thurston-moore/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a recent interview</a>, Moore admitted he positioned “Germs Burn”—a more oblique manifestation of his <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP9ZcjJdV-o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">unyielding</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlRopLsKnHw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Darby Crash obsession</a>—as <i>The Best Day</i>’s closer not because its contrast of gleaming guitar jangle and hardcore-inspired staccato phrasing makes for a particularly dramatic finale, but simply because he was unhappy with his vocal performance on it and wanted to bury it. All of which suggests that, with <i>The Best Day</i>, Moore is really laying the groundwork for a better tomorrow. </p></div>"|19861.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19861-thurston-moore-the-best-day/|7.1|Stuart Berman

The second full-length from Montreal quartet TOPS comprises 12 examples of lithe, bubbly songwriting that winks at you even as it tears up. Rarely clocking in over four minutes, each song features the same sparse instrumentation (bass, drum kit, maybe two guitars, sometimes a synth, and vocals), as if the goal of their DIY recording sessions was to perfect a hooky single and a wistful ballad using only one set of tools. Fully enjoying TOPS' 43-minute LP hinges on how many times you'd like to hear them try.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Picture You Staring</i> considers itself an album of breezy AM radio hits, despite having been written by people who were born well after that was a thing. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24051-captain-tennille/"">Captain &amp; Tennille</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3092-harry-nilsson/"">Harry Nilsson</a> are ostensible reference points, but it's less disingenuous to call the music what it is: post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a> bedroom pop. That's not to say the Canadian band is aiming for Pink's spot, as their sound is far too spry and lucid for such glammy psychedelia. No one would confuse ""Sleeptalker""'s heavy-lidded Danelectro fingerpicking and the funky skip of ""Easier Said"" for one of Pink's considerable high points, but it's possible they'll eventually wind up alongside each other on hopelessly lovesick playlists.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Variety is of little concern for TOPS, so near-perfect songwriting and a dynamic tracklist is all the more important. The stunning ""Outside"" effortlessly reimagines Angelo Badalamenti's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29150-julee-cruise/"">Julee Cruise</a>-sung ""Falling"" theme from ""Twin Peaks"", casting singer Jane Penny's waifish coo next to plush synth pads and wavering baritone guitar. But its quick three and a half minutes are soon missed, as ""All the People Sleep"" tries drawing a drowsy grin onto the melancholic mood. Picking the pace back up for <i>Picture You Staring</i>'s second half, ""Superstition Future"" sets a nimble gait for its slinky guitar chords and singalong choruses to follow, with varied success; anti-anthem ""Change of Heart"" uses breathless whimsy and keyboard flourishes with more economical precision than ""2 Shy"". TOPS return to weightless balladry for their dual finale, but no matter how deeply affecting each one feels, it's hard to reconcile that ""Driverless Passenger"" is essentially a guitar-led preamble to the whispering synth flicker of ""Destination"".</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-43bd0e3b-1ad0-d30b-a3b2-3ce03b5e84c7""><span>The structure of ""Blind Faze"" makes a fitting metaphor for </span><i>Picture You Staring</i><span>. Bright-eyed and charming, the song is built on a handful of earwormy riffs, Penny's endearingly carefree melodies, and an unassuming dance beat. A perfectly likeable set of sounds, yes, but it's preceded by a dazzling synth arrangement worthy of a standalone composition. The suite barely lasts over 15 seconds and is only revisited once, when it lilts underneath the perky reprise closing the tune. Just as TOPS finish the song without exploring that theme any further, so can ardent pop lovers appreciate reliable hooks, pithy songwriting, and familiar arrangements without much sublimity and innovation. But once those qualities do bubble to the surface, it's hard not to wonder why they don't show up a little more often.</span></span></p></div>"|19944.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19944-tops-picture-you-staring/|7.0|Patric Fallon

Booze, heroin, bands, and collaborators have all framed his existence with some kind of meaning and then been tossed out, sometimes returning, sometimes remaining dead and buried. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16253-blues-funeral/""><i>Blues Funeral</i></a>—Lanegan’s stubbornly against-type 2012 album, where he folded in, of all things, an impulse for electronica and a dash of New Romantic swagger—had started to look like an anomaly in his canon, a bungled attempt at channeling unlikely influences that were then left to drift into the pool of past-life identities he’s accumulated. His 2013 covers record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18496-mark-lanegan-imitations/""><i>Imitations</i></a>, drew on work by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1271-greg-dulli/"">Greg Dulli</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/710-nick-cave/"">Nick Cave</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Weill"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kurt Weill</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/649-john-cale/"">John Cale</a>—in other words, exactly the sort of influences you’d expect the former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4122-screaming-trees/"">Screaming Trees</a> frontman to be channeling. But here he is with another album as the Mark Lanegan Band, which in part gets back to the feel he was chasing on <i>Blues Funeral</i>, albeit with a more assured hand ghosting through it.</p>
<p>The story behind <i>Phantom Radio</i> is of someone undergoing a unique conflict with his own past. On one hand it’s clear Lanegan wants to make a break from previous working methods, writing faster, more efficiently, and embracing technology by recording on his phone. But he still has a clutch of older influences on his shoulder that he’s determined to rinse out in song, including a wide array of styles from the '80s and '90s that were completely fenced off from his world in Screaming Trees. It’s not always the most palatable way to experience Lanegan, especially when he channels the MOR-hop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2832-morcheeba/"">Morcheeba</a> on “The Killing Season”, clumsily fusing it with lyrics that are straight out of his dead-eyed-drunk past (“I wear my old grey overcoat,” he growls, as the song fades to a close). Lanegan has never come across as someone who’s at ease with his past or present, so the heart of the struggle is familiar here, even if the tools aren’t. It makes sense that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6161-kurt-cobain/"">Kurt Cobain</a> was an ally in the grunge era—both often came across as being remarkably uncomfortable in their own bodies on stage.</p>
<p>The common feel in a handful of songs here is one of mini symphonies, condensed down into pocket-sized works that create a juxtaposition between Lanegan’s large and small inclinations. “Harvest Home” is one of the strongest works from a lyrical perspective, but its execution is an odd mixture of flat, tinny beats and swooping synthesized strings. It’s a trick Lanegan likes to repeat. “Floor of the Ocean” has a similar uplift, undercut by a moodiness reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26609-echo-and-the-bunnymen/"">Echo and the Bunnymen</a> circa “The Killing Moon”. On “Seventh Day”, there’s an airy, flute-driven ambience and a bed of electronics, none of which are elements most longstanding Lanegan fans probably ever expected him to be working with, but ones which he’s becoming increasingly at ease with judging from this album. “Waltzing in Blue” lands somewhere between the frigid melodrama of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"">Joy Division</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1714-beth-gibbons/"">Beth Gibbons</a>’ mournful darkness in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"">Portishead</a>, with Lanegan providing the perfect male flipside to her damaged wail.</p>
<p><i>Phantom Radio</i> also provides plenty of moments that don’t startle, with a generous portion of it anchored in the stripped-down sinking feeling Lanegan has fitfully returned to since <i>The Winding Sheet</i> in 1990. He throws out “Judgement Time” early in the record, but it’s among his best on this collection, getting back to something resembling the blackness of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Xlry0OAOMo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Eyes of a Child”</a>, where the sheer coercion of his voice overwhelms from the second it’s introduced. It’s noticeable how Lanegan’s voice has become more brittle over the years, becoming less like a drunk preacher who’s going to gut you and eat you and more like someone quaking in fear of an insufferable end. On the similarly bare “I Am the Wolf” and “The Wild People” you can hear the quiver in his voice, feel the tremors in his hands. It’s not hard to conclude that this is the person Lanegan’s running from in his other material here, although one thing he is remarkably good at across his body of work is letting in disarming moments of vulnerability, where he pulls you in to spectate upon the wreck of his life. On <i>Phantom Radio</i> there are just a few too many times when it's all dressed up in unnecessary complication.</p></div>"|19942.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19942-mark-lanegan-band-phantom-radio/|6.7|Nick Neyland

During his time behind bars, from 1996, until 2001, he became obsessed with music. He spoke about the experience in detail with <i>Murder Dog</i>'s Deyu Ntebya in a <a href=""http://murderdog.com/april_2009/awax.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2009 interview</a>: ""Early on when I first started rapping in prison I felt like I couldn’t actually word what I was trying to say,"" he told Ntebya. ""I had been though a lot of experiences, but I couldn’t put on the paper the way I saw it."" Now thirteen years deep into his career, A-Wax remains a controversial cult figure, publically defined as much by beef as music, winning converts and turning off others in equal measure. But those early struggles learning to articulate his perspective must seem distant now; if his latest album, <i>Pullin' Strings</i>, is not the best gangster rap album of 2014, it's certainly the most evocatively written.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>A-Wax is an old soul, a craftsman in a messy era of perpetual mindspray. He owes a debt to a longstanding—and long undervalued—lineage of hip-hop writers. This includes his immediate progenitors the Mob Figaz—a Pittsburg, CA-based hip-hop crew that was among the most influential in the last decade of Bay Area hip-hop—and their influences, including 2Pac, C-Bo, and Cormega. A-Wax has had beef with the Mob Figaz for years, or it's at least surfaced online in bitter accusations. A-Wax claims he's the messenger for his friends behind the walls (ask any Bay Area head about the veracity of A-Wax's claims, and you get the carefully reframed answer of an agnostic: ""He thinks they're true."") But regardless of the bridges burned, A-Wax has developed his own highly personal, principled style. While he has been damaged, his eye for subjectively truthful prose has not.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>His conceptual focus on <i>Pullin' Strings</i> is loneliness. This isn't 27-problems-only-introverts-will-understand lonely or heartbroken lonely or last-man-on-earth sci-fi flick lonely—this is a much more exhaustive desolation. For A-Wax, it is an occupational hazard forced by circumstance, the consequences and paradoxes of a life lived illegally. This loneliness comes accompanied by paranoia and anxiety, fatalism and regret, each amplified by the life-or-death stakes of his (former?) profession. A-Wax's alienation isn't expressed as mere trite sadness, but through the prism of realism: calloused nonchalance, self-effacing humor, virulent bitterness, and profound melancholy, sometimes all at once. Weariness permeates the album. The betrayals and double-crosses don't sting with surprise; they are inevitable, and linger like a dull bruise.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>If a world populated with personalities is splashed in color, <i>Pullin' Strings</i> compliments its bleak isolation by drawing in high-contrast black and white. Sometimes, when the light hits just right, the backdrop takes on a sunset tinge. The production is sleek, stripped down, and often subtly melodic; the dominant sound is one of wistful somnolence. Fuzzed guitars are sanded to a smooth surface and the focus is tight. The moments that vary from this mean are still spare. Even tracks that lean belligerent gain their power from their potential for aggression, rather than the therapeutic release of it. They are often balanced by humor or conceptual wit: take ""Jetsons"" and its cartoon conceit (""By the time he's home as a parolee/ We'll have a robotic maid we call Rosie""), the daytime TV-referencing ""Maury Dance"", or album standout ""No Limit"" (""We just ridin' around with two K's like my name was Silkk the Shocker""). That song has one of the record's best beats, a delicate blend of low quarter-note keyboards, a descending mallet effect that skitters across the track, and what sounds like the 'fasten seatbelt' alert—as if the camera were set on a drizzling crime scene where a car door hangs ajar. Like the record as a whole, it thrives on a canvas of negative space. There are no guest rappers on the album, and A-Wax does his own choruses. His earnest, droning sing-song magnifies an underlying pathos.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But the heart of the record is in its writing, which is as austere as the production. A-Wax creates an immersive narrative by locating the unlikely intersection of the direct and the oblique. He is purposeful in his use of hints and implication, understatement and aphorism. Much like his facility for hooks (""More hooks than a tackle box"") it's a tactic of which he's plenty aware (""Thinking more just saying less""). Of course there are the bare bones ingredients of purist street rap, where authenticity underpins his story—you'll hear about the drugs (""She ain't spill no cake mix/Whole kitchen counter like eight bricks"") and the violence (""You don't want me ridin' round thinking it's an issue/We're gon' be around still to see if people miss you""). But he's interested in something more than simple glorification (""All they see is the come-up, they don't notice the losses""). For those who've followed A-Wax's career closely, a willingness to wrestle with consequences gives him a leg up on much gangster theater, an acknowledgement of the psychological costs of the lifestyle he sells.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On <i>Pullin' Strings</i>, the visible stitching of crime to consequence in his earlier work has been flipped to the inside of his life's broader embroidery; the record promises a seamless, uncompromised self-portrait, his lyrics elliptical and focused less on details than dynamics: ""Had a plan that didn't pan out the way that I thought it would/ After everything that I put her through, I just want my mama good."" He's a man of principle; on ""Only Pray"", he upbraids a target for lack of character: ""God won't ever answer your prayers/ Because you only pray in handcuffs/ How convenient, you turn to God when you need some help."" Although he's not afraid to be misanthropic, this song could as easily be turned inward, or at a past self, as at another. Who it addresses remains ambiguous.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Much of the record is oriented around A-Wax's distrust of friends and foes (""Use one hand to count the people that I'm close to""). Other than his mother, women are trophies (""Broke that marriage up like kush""), as treacherous as men, and not immune to his cruelty. (A right-minded person might do some herculean compartmentalizing at the album's midsection.) Humor balances somber subject matter; on ""Trainwreck"", which finds A-Wax pointing the chopper at the mirror, whimsical production mocks his self-pity without undercutting his sincerity. ""Trust Issues"" takes a more serious tack: ""I just don't know who to trust, overthink when I think it over."" The growing sketch of not just a flawed but unreliable narrator is whittled to a fine paradox here. ""Wipin' off my chopper rounds, grown as hell still play with guns/ Shot my friend on accident then told some ho come get the gun/ I just can't do nothing right, I just can't do nothing wrong/ Make this shit seem effortless, live life like I'm above the law.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">""Trust Issues"" is the first record in a trio that make up the album's emotive heart. The second, ""Trukfit"", cleanly connects typically vivid writing (""Duckin' the grave plot, plottin' the hold up/We'll be in the same spot for now cuz we sold stuff"") to a moving sample of Malaysian singer-songwriter Yuna's immaculate <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pR4NeF86z8o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Someone Out of Town""</a>. But the album's climactic moment and most potent articulation is the cathartic ""Be Alone,"" which makes explicit what had been implied. Isolation isn't just a consequence, but a conscious choice, a strategy of self-preservation.</p></div>"|19897.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19897-a-wax-pullin-strings/|7.6|David Drake

You can hear it in his light, affable voice, the bright and exuberant sounds he surrounds it with. But death and rot and despair are always nearby. Estranged family members stalk his lyrics, threatening to bring chaos. He flirts with bitterness and jaundice—""Anything I do in music is never celebrated,"" he laments on ""Pet Sematary,"" from his new album <i>The Midnight Life</i>—but he backs away carefully, with a chuckle. This peculiar brand of pathos, a mixture of the antic and the mournful, should have its own word—""Quikenfreude,"" maybe.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And <i>The Midnight Life</i> is rich in Quikenfreude. The album opens with a goofy, self-deprecating skit in which some reverent young rappers ask Quik what the rap game needs, and he responds, to their bewilderment, ""a banjo."" It's a little joke about the West Coast pioneer's career-long preference for obscure, unfashionable sounds and instruments, and he dials up a banjo sound on the first full song to underline the point. Against this playful backdrop, though, he unleashes a torrent of bile and resentment, lashing out against men, women, fans, and enemies alike. ""You're lucky my security don't want it to pop/ They looking out for you bastards, if it was me you'd be shot,"" he warns. The picture he paints of himself—alone, ridiculed and envied by locals, and preyed upon relentlessly by close friends and associates—is bleak.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>The Midnight Life</i> is accordingly sharper and more brittle-sounding than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15369-the-book-of-david/""><i>The Book of David </i></a>from 2011, which glowed with warm horns and jazz piano. But the enlivening Quik touch is everywhere: 25 years into his career, he is still discovering how 2 or 3 sounds can make you momentarily forget how rap songs usually go, the directions they head in. ""Trapped On The Tracks"" begins like his version of hyphy before rewinding and fast-forwarding itself into something much stranger and unclassifiable. ""Shine"" is one long loop of piano that keeps doubling back on itself, as if the track is gasping, while warped bells chime like bowed cymbals dipped in water. Even the straightforward rap/R&amp;B hybrids have something startling going on in them.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> His records are also increasingly beautiful in his late career, matching pristine clarity with palpable warmth. He loves session musicians, and keeps a small army of them in business— including guitarist Robert ""Fonksta"" Bacon, whose clipped rhythm guitar murmurs from every corner and who gets his own interlude to stretch out. On ""El's Interlude 2"", bongos start playing, and they are simply the most gorgeously recorded bongos you've ever heard in your life. This might sound insanely trivial, but really—you need to hear them. You can hear the thumb callouses.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>These little moments are far from trivial for Quik's music--they comprise its essence. To hear the loving way he treats synths and keys, letting them blur into a composite glimmer, on ""Pet Sematary"", is to appreciate what lifelong love, diligently applied, sounds like. Few rap producers have communicated as much visceral joy in the craft of record-making as Quik.""And when I play this guitar, it's gonna make my dick hard,"" he crows on ""Life Jacket"", and it might be the most quintessentially Quik line ever.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>He's claimed this is his most carefree, unencumbered record, but if that's true, free time only makes him fiercer. ""I got niggas in my hood that can't even buy gold/ But swearin' up and down they ballin out of control/ You niggas is fakin, acting like they got cocaine bakin/ With a fuckin' day job at the train station,"" he sneers on ""Pet Sematary"". Enough? No, not quite, as he adds, ""And they gotta apply every year for that job."" Nothing summons eloquence from Quik quite like scorn. ""Produce Whitney and Janet!/ Oh, you can't."" Can you shut someone down faster than that?</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Quik has been complicit in downplaying his own rapping occasionally—""I almost talk; I don't even rap,"" he observed to <i>Complex</i>—but he's criminally under-appreciated as a lyricist,and might be the best and most original of his generation of producer/rappers. On ""The Conduct"", he's on his ""Third passport, poppin Ambien on international flights."" He pulls the top back on his car on ""Puffin Tha Dragon"" to ""Let the raindrops kiss me on my angelic face."" He's poetic; he's hilarious; he's catchy; he's poignant. ""I'm a geek I suppose/ I'm a freak I suppose/ I'm whatever you want me to be this week I suppose,"" he offers slyly on ""That Getter"". He's the tortoise and the hare, impossible to pin down and sure to outlast us all.</span></p></div>"|19930.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19930-dj-quik-the-midnight-life/|8.2|Jayson Greene

Pretty much every song on <i>Still Life</i>—the second LP in a year's time from the former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27672-woods/"">Woods</a> bassist/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28076-the-babies/"">Babies</a> co-founder—finds Morby on the move, setting off to sea or motoring away, never to return again. Listening to the rich, reflective <i>Still Life</i>, it's easy to picture Morby with a wineskin under his arm, his every worldly possession hitched to his back, an eye constantly fixed on some faraway point on the horizon. All this wayfaring's clearly taught him a few things; catch him in just the right mood, and he's got stories to share, hard-earned wisdom to impart.</p>
<p>Morby's joined on <i>Still Life</i> by guitarist/bassist Rob Barbato (who also produces), drummer Justin Sullivan, organist Will Canzoneri, and—on three songs—bassist H. Hawkline. This skeleton crew—many of whom joined Morby on last year's similarly gorgeous <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18796-kevin-morby-harlem-river/""><i>Harlem River</i></a>—gives <i>Still Life</i> its scrupulous, unshowy sound: deliberate fretwork, sparse percussion, wisps of organ and tinkling pianos dancing around the edges of the frame. Morby's warm, reedy sigh is front-and-center throughout most of these songs, and his halting, ruminative delivery keeps you hanging on his every word. <i>Still Life </i>is steeped in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Dylan</a>'s back-to-basics period at the turn of the '70s, carefully adorned but never skeletal; from the beating-heart bassline that sits underneath ""Drowning"" to the drunken horns that close out the eight-minute ""Amen"", <i>Still Life</i> is sumptuous, slightly rickety, offhandedly gorgeous.<br/><br/>Morby's a judicious lyricist, able to flesh out a scene with just a few carefully-chosen details. The situations on <i>Still Life</i> never quite seem to have a fixed beginning or end, as though Morby's knows it'd take too long to explain exactly where he's been and can't rightly say just where he's going to end up next. Two songs in, we meet Arlo Jones, a drunken lout of Morby's acquaintance. Halfway through the song, Morby quite literally starts listing off everything he can remember of the titular Jones, yet he only gets to number three on this nine-item rundown before he begins to repeat himself. But you come away from ""The Ballad of Arlo Jones"" learning just as much about the guy telling the story as you do its subject; Morby's impassioned wails of ""He was my friend!"" suggest a longing for connection, no matter how temporary.</p>
<p>The short, spirited ""Motors Running"", a none-too-fond fare-thee-well to a fellow traveler, gives you almost nothing in terms of backstory: ""We had just gotten started,"" Morby sings, ""with black shadows coming out of your door."" But in just a few lines, he manages to tell you everything you need to know: you can stay, Morby seems to be saying, but I've gotta keep moving. Throughout <i>Still Life</i>, Morby will introduce a character or describe a situation, but you never get the sense that these are permanent fixtures in Morby's life so much as markers on the long, oft-lonesome road he's traveling on.</p>
<p>All this roving has Morby thinking long and hard about impermanence; if travel is Morby's favorite subject, death is an awfully close second. ""I'm not dead,"" he assures himself halfway through ""Amen"", ""but I'm dying—so slow, so slow."" The song ends with a vision: the phrase ""expect death"" comes to him ""gently, like a leaf on top of water."" It's as though Morby, after years on the road, can actually feel himself coming unmoored, and this—like everything else—he seems to greet with a kind of quiet acceptance, a wisdom well beyond his years. <i>Still Life</i> doesn't dwell on the past, but occasionally, Morby alludes to the things he's left behind with a certain stoicism: ""They say all that i've done wrong/ One day is gonna find me"" he sings on ""Drowning"". Morby, forever playing things close to the chest, might not take the time to spell out every mistake. But when he delivers that line, there's an ocean of regret lingering in his throat.<br/><br/>The title <i>Still Life</i> is both a nod—to a piece by New York pop artist Maynard Monrow—and something of a joke: Morby recently pulled up roots in Brooklyn and became a full-time Los Angelino. Throughout Morby's many travels, you can sense a longing for some stability, a homebase, a place of his own to return to. ""If you don't see me in the evening,"" he sings on the closing ""Our Moon"", ""look at our moon, up in its night."" By the song's end, Morby seems to've finally found himself some suitable company, someone to join him as he makes his next move. ""Sing to me in the morning,"" he asks, ""keep me warm from the storm outside."" In just a few words, Morby manages to say everything he needs.</p></div>"|19927.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19927-kevin-morby-still-life/|7.9|Paul Thompson

Certainly, his subsequent output as Dntel reflects as much; 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10124-dumb-luck/""><i>Dumb Luck</i></a> was an awkward shadow of <i>Possibilities</i> at best, and five years later, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16695-aimlessness/""><i>Aimlessness</i></a> proved that Tamborello's interest in vocal-centric glitch-pop singles had all but given way to macro views of the drowsy electronics hiccuping inside them. His latest full-length continues to tread similar terrain while eschewing proper guest vocals altogether, and yet tethers its central theme to an evident misnomer in its title, <i>Human Voice</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It's unsurprising that this album's title is so literal: </span><i>Dumb Luck</i><span> was a direct reaction to Tamborello stumbling into a goldmine with the Postal Service, and the connotations of </span><i>Aimlessness</i><span> served both the half-decade gap between releases and its music's meandering arrangements. So by that logic, </span><i>Human Voice</i><span> plays like a purging of the titular baggage Dntel has carried in his arsenal since 2001—it's no coincidence that the first ""vocal"" sound we hear is from the chintzy </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_SK-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Casio SK-1</span></a><span> preset which gives the album and opening track their name. There are no real voices until the third track, when the piano-wrapped footwork experiments of ""If I Stay a Minute"" reach a faint crescendo, and even then its all backwards half-syllables and sonorant incidentals. ""Foraya"" does the same thing with a slo-mo loop over skipping house beats and Dntel's typically twitchy, twittering synth lines, sounding not unlike an unfinished </span><i>Give Up</i><span> demo. There's not one actual lyric to be found on </span><i>Human Voice</i><span>'s eight productions, and that's totally fine.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>It could be assumed that Tamborello wrote an album of strictly instrumental electronic music as an attempt to reclaim Dntel's musical identity from that giddy, over-fed elephant that follows him onto every release, and for the most part he has. The tender pads and modest harmonies of ""Fringes of Focus (Instrumental)""  are unmistakably Dntel, and the misty-eyed and circuit-bent closer ""Ashby"" is blissfully pure early aughts </span><i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clicks_%26_Cuts_Series"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Clicks &amp; Cuts</a></i><span> fare with heavy emotional undertones, which is essentially what </span><i>Possibilities</i><span>' non-vocal tracks were extrapolating from in 2001.

By shedding the weight of his past accolades, Tamborello's given himself enough space to return to the music of his less-remembered successes.</span> <i>Human Voice</i> gently nudges him back into the spotlight to speak his mind alone, and even if his voice isn't the most exciting and innovative one in today's electronic music landscape, it is unmistakably his own.</p></div>"|19940.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19940-dntel-human-voice/|6.8|Patric Fallon

In the final minute of “Almost Careless”, the near-whispered lilt that closes The Weather Station’s splendid six-song EP, <i>What Am I Going to Do with Everything I Know</i>, Tamara Lindeman stumbles upon one of the most important questions she may ever ask, simply while walking to the park. During a momentary break in the gentle supporting rhythm, she remembers what she posed to the boy whose gloved hand she held: “‘What if we get married?’” she sings, her voice cracking into an audible smile as she climbs the final word’s syllabic slope. “I said it almost careless, as though it was nothing to me.” Lindeman, her sudden fiancé and the band behind her treat the peak with equitable nonchalance. He blushes and nods, she narrates, and they turn and walk, the pedal steel between her voice and the drums guiding the pair like a soft flashlight. Instead of Hallmark strings, Lindeman gives her tremendous moment the deference of restraint.</p>
<p>That same subtle and balanced approach defines all of <i>What Am I Going to Do</i>, a 17-minute record that finds Lindeman moving from abject loneliness to impending marriage without ever becoming loud, fast or bothered. The Weather Station’s terrific 2011 LP, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/8788-border-crossing/4/"" target=""_blank"">All of it Was Mine</a>,<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/8788-border-crossing/4/"" target=""_blank""> </a></i>used similar understatement to offer an elliptical picture of love fracturing, with the changing seasons turning innocent sweetness into hard-won self-sovereignty. But these short and intertwined tunes portray the stepwise process <i>into</i> love. They seem, however, written and played from a distance, so that the butterflies and doubts have settled into a graceful, logical arc. Lindeman’s voice flits and cracks, peaks and valleys, comforts and cries, not unlike that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"">Joni Mitchell</a>. But she possesses the unwavering patience of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"">Bill Callahan</a>’s later records, delivering every word and worry like she’s pondered it all into acceptance.   </p>
<p>On opener “Don’t Understand”, she worries that she’s “irreversibly free,” or forever alone, as she tries to sleep on a stranger’s couch. But over drums brushed so softly and organ played so faintly you might mistake them for a ghost in the studio’s machines, she states the scene without mourning it—it’s only her reality. Only four tracks later, when things turn serious with the quiet boy who’s just moved in, Lindeman lists the worries that most young lovers encounter: Will it get boring? Will it get tough? Will it survive? Her perennially soft voice flirts with hardness here, a whiff of irritation coming through as he makes jokes when she wonders this stuff aloud. But still, she seems mollified by the relative stranger’s presence, her mind eased by his casual calm. In the last verse, two backup singers rise to meet Lindeman with country-soul harmonies, as if to say ""everyone’s been here."" Assured again, Lindeman lets the song fade into the resolve of a final, firm piano chord.</p>
<p><i>What Am I Going to Do</i> actually stems from two sessions in separate countries, a testament to Lindeman’s consistent vision for these songs and her material at large. She cut “Don’t Understand” and “Seemed True,” the album’s romantic centerpiece, in North Carolina, with a crew that included members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7129-megafaun"">Megafaun</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30386-hiss-golden-messenger/"">Hiss Golden Messenger</a>. The rest was made back in Ontario with Daniel Romano, the songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer who helmed <i>All of it was Mine</i>, too. But these tracks all feel uniform and effortless, like first takes captured in real-time by a band that has lived the story just like Lindeman. For songs so intimate, and performances so inward, such careful singularity feels like a remarkable feat.</p>
<p>Lindeman first came<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0394045/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> into the public eye as an actress</a>, a biographical note that may help explain why her songs have always felt so filled with detail, like a perfectly planned shot in a meticulous production. On <i>All of it was Mine</i>, for instance, she surveyed her domain with a botanist’s eye—“muddy white petunias, lobelia trails blue-eyed”—and immortalized her grandmother’s virtues with one line: “It was good to sit together, on her couch of seafoam green.” But Lindeman’s earlier work felt like a life seen from some art-house distance, where questions about motivations and meanings remained in the spaces between shots. While <i>What Am I Going to Do</i> isn’t so obvious as to be pedantic or cloying, it embraces the familiar and linear in a way that Lindeman’s work never has. This time, she asks the questions for us, like why she’s fallen in love, if it’s moving too fast, or if this might end with rings and legal documents. And then she commits, for the first time on tape, to the unknown and ends the album with at least one answer—an accepted marriage proposal. “Then we turned across the park’s expanse, open fields of last year’s grass,” her voice confides, tracing her private joy, “heading back with one question less than we started out with.” It is, for now, The Weather Station’s very subtle peak.</p></div>"|19825.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19825-weather-station-what-am-i-going-to-do-with-everything-i-know/|8.1|Grayson Haver Currin

Shortly thereafter, the band covered <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/521-butthole-surfers/"" target=""_blank"">Butthole Surfers</a>’ “Graveyard"" while giving away free ice cream to a crowd of kids in Chicago’s Humboldt Park <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppLRUHb_tOc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as part of the A.V. Club’s “Undercover” series</a>. Strangely enough, that puzzling performance provides more evidence of the band’s staying power than <i>Everybody Loves Sausages </i>and <i>Tres Cabrones </i>combined. To see beloved oddball frontman King Buzzo excitedly croak “Free ice cream!” and toss chilly freebies to eager children, as his bandmates (including Butthole Surfers bassist JD Pinkus) continue to pierce eardrums, is telling what it is about the Melvins that continues to amaze: their untainted devotion to chaos, rooted in a perverse Peter Pan complex.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Considering their filthy, flippant reputation and their shared affinities for black humor and gleeful racket, a Melvins/Butthole Surfers crossover comes as no real surprise. The collaboration didn’t stop with ice cream trucks, either: Pinkus supported Melvins on their recent tour, and Surfers guitarist Paul Leary joined his former bandmate shortly afterward for sessions with Osborne and drummer Dale Crover. The result is <i>Hold It In, </i>a musical merger between the two bands that amplifies the uncanniness of that Chicago one-off. It’s also one of the catchiest Melvins record to date, containing syrupy, sickeningly sweet melodies built upon the bedrock of both bands’ usual scuzzy styles. </p>
<p class=""p1""> The quartet's warped pop exhibits many forms on <i>Hold It In</i>, from swampy garage (“Eyes on You”) to stoner jams (“Onions Make the Milk Go Bad”), but the underlying idea is rather static: taking the grotesque and defanging it by way of caricature to fuse the catchy with the creepy. The choppy new-wave guitars of “Brass Cupcake” initially comes across as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/690-the-cars/"">the Cars</a> updated for the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8794-torche/"">Torche</a> set, but when the chorus kicks in and Buzzo screams, “Because they’ve got a lot of mouths to feed!/ And their noses and their mouths will bleed!”, dragging out his “e”s like a Saturday morning cartoon villain, it’s clear that the band haven’t lost their fascination with B-movie thrills. On similarly grizzled cuts like “Sesame Street Meat” and “The Bunk Up”, bloodlust and carnality take on a cartoonish guise, conveyed through stomping percussion and jagged fretwork but, in the case of the latter, disarmingly pleasant shoegazey non-sequiturs (the sonic equivalent, perhaps, of Osborne’s ice-cream-tossing interlude). At times, though, the disparity between sweet and sour toes the line between clever and cloying: “You Can Make Me Wait” debunks any oddball theories that a Melvins song featuring vocoder vocals in the place of down-tuned guitars could possibly be a good thing, drifting along lethargically until Leary pushes it along with a triumphant solo that comes across as too little, too late.<span style=""font-size: 15px;""> </span></p>
<p class=""p1"">The roles Leary and Pinkus play on <i>Hold It In </i>prove more supportive than directive. Most of the time, the two musicians play by Melvins’ down-tuned, down-strummed house rules, unashamedly stoic and determined to amplify their peers' freak-outs. Considered alongside the swathe of chug-a-thons dominating the record, the Butthole Surfers’ touches—such as the repeated blues solos and lechery-drenched growls distinguishing “ Eyes on You” and “I Get Along (Hollow Moon)”—scan as grafts of the two’s Texan rock upon their Cascadian counterparts, rather than impositions. In this regard, <i>Hold It In </i>subverts the mercurial, self-contradictory schtick that undermines so many collaborative LPs.</p>
<p class=""p1"">By the time the record’s second half rolls around, however, the band's carnivalesque perspective, proves myopic. After ""Sesame Street Meat"", the album's gnarled touches lose their menace, swept away by one-dimensional bluesy cuts and jam-session rambling that engulfs longer tracks like""The Bunk Up""and ""House of Gasoline"". So it goes with Melvins—they're the musical equivalent of that endearingly wacky uncle who <span>believe in ghosts, conspiracy theories, and punk rock. They can be a bit one-note sometimes, but that doesn't make them any less beloved; without their ribaldness, the world of heavy music just wouldn't be as fun.</span></p></div>"|19700.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19700-melvins-hold-it-in/|6.1|Zoe Camp

The popular summary of ""The Year Punk Broke"" involves <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>'s <i>Nevermind</i> dominating Top 40 radio and shifting the way people listened to music. This is definitely true on one level, but there were plenty of music fans of a certain age and temperament who were already digging deeper than that, and continued hearing things the same way after ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" became a sensation.</p>
<p>But, still, it was a strange time for people heavily invested in the underground, a pre-internet moment when indie groups didn't appear on late night TV as regularly as they do now, you never gave much thought to advertising or PR, and you could walk up to someone wearing a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2187-the-jesus-lizard/"">Jesus Lizard </a>T-shirt and know you'd have a lot in common. So, even if you didn't pay much attention to Nirvana's ascension, when punk did break, previously small bands were swept up and placed in a context they were unfamiliar with until that moment; as a result, more people were coming to shows, wearing those shirts, and muddying the waters.</p>
<p>In this era, the Oakland-via-New-York punk trio Jawbreaker, fronted by the charismatic Blake Schwarzenbach, were one of the bands you built romantic and platonic relationships around, a group that, at their height, felt more important than more basic, run-of-the-mill acts in your record collection. (They themselves felt, oddly, like family—or at least very close friends.) As far as the pervasive grunge narrative and their place in the post-1991 world, they toured with Nirvana in October of 1993 shortly before releasing their third, most beloved album, <i>24 Hour Revenge Therapy</i>. That tour and the album led to a million dollar record deal with DGC and their fourth and final record, <i>Dear You</i>, which they recorded with <i>Dookie</i> producer Rob Cavallo and released in September of 1995.</p>
<p>People weren't into that major label record, to put it mildly. My girlfriend at the time smashed the promotional cassette copy I gave her and walked away in disgust. People were shell-shocked at the glossier production: I honestly saw a man with a Jawbreaker tattoo weeping at the record store where I worked. Schwarzenbach had undergone surgery to remove a polyp from his vocal chords before recording <i>24 Hour Revenge Therapy</i>, but we thought that's why his gnarled vocals sounded cleaner on <i>Dear You</i>. It didn't matter to us that the polyp had been painful, and maybe life threatening—we'd lost our voice as he regained his. Part of it was the times—the post-<i>Nevermind</i> label feeding frenzy hitting people who thought they were immune to it—and part of it was because, really, they were more than just a band to people: Jawbreaker articulated why you got into punk, and once you did, why you stayed there. Like the musical companions to the punk rock zine <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Cometbus"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Cometbus</i></a>, their songs<i> </i>felt like how-to manuals, as well as holy writ.</p>
<p>The biggest issue, though, was that <i>24 Hour Revenge Therapy</i> was a punk masterpiece. When listening to <i>Dear You</i> now, with clearer ears, it obviously has merit—in fact, it's a very good record—but at the time, it was following the group's most beloved collection and folks were depressed. (When you listen to the two in tandem in 2014, the shift remains marked, and <i>24</i> is the stronger, more memorable collection, but <i>Dear You</i> does feel like a logical next move.)</p>
<p>If <i>24 Hour Revenge Therapy</i> were a book, it's the kind you'd carry around in your pocket. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17437-bivouac/"">Jawbreaker</a> recorded the bulk of it with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6367-steve-albini/"">Steve Albini</a>, and did three of its songs with <i>Bivouac</i> producer Billy Anderson (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30405-sleep/"">Sleep</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1943-high-on-fire/"">High on Fire</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2736-melvins/"">Melvins</a>). <i>Bivouac</i>, which they'd released in 1992, was more progressive overall, as the band expanded to writing ambitiously huge, heavy songs. On <i>24 Hour Revenge Therapy</i>, they reined things in and offered up simpler, punkier tracks, hearkening back to the sound of the 1990 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14079-unfun/""><i>Unfun</i></a>.</p>
<p>The 11 songs hit on multiple levels—as catchy pop-punk anthems, as well as first-hand documentation of what it meant to be involved in that world at that time. <i>24 Hour Revenge</i> <i>Therapy</i> draws a landscape of people hopping into trains and house parties, kids with chipped teeth drinking too much coffee, kissing on roofs, and fucking in bathrooms: ""We hung our clothes up on the floor and put our faith in a closed door."" Schwarzenbach's mix of punk poetry (""You don't know what I'm all about/ Like killing cops and reading Kerouac""), earnest feelings (""We're too smart to watch TV/ We're too dumb to make believe this is all we want from life""), and real-life details (""Remember our life?/ I did the dishes while you read out loud"") won people over. As did the gruff, shredded vocal delivery, which came off like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4576-paul-westerberg/"">Paul Westerberg</a> (or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19331-psychedelic-furs/"">Psychedelic Furs</a>' Richard Butler) tearing into Crass.</p>
<p>It's hugely romantic stuff, in all senses of the word. The album opens with a song from the point of view of a broken-down boat that will never see the ocean again, then fixates on the number 13 (on ""Jinx Removing"", Schwarzenbach refers to himself as ""a superstitious hyperrealist"") and on losing your voice and your love: ""Someone said your name/ I thought of you alone/ I was just the same 20 blocks away.""</p>
<p>Basically, Schwarzenbach wrote about being Blake Schwarzenbach, warts and all. On ""Condition Oakland"", he howls ""Climbed out onto my roof/ So I'd be a poet in the night"" and makes like Young Werther: ""This is my condition/ Desperate, alone, without an excuse/ I try to explain/ Christ, what's the use?"" On ""Do You Still Hate Me?"", he sets one of his crystal clear scenes—""I have a picture of you and me in Brooklyn/ On a porch, it was raining/ Hey, I remember that day... And I miss you""—followed by a series of questions: ""Are you out there?/ Do you hear me?/ Can I call you?/ Do you still hate me?"" In the land of <i>24 Hour Revenge Therapy</i>, nothing and nobody sticks around, but that doesn't mean you forget.</p>
<p>The songs people talked about most, though, were probably ""Boxcar"" and ""Indictment"", which predicted the aftermath of <i>Dear You</i>. Both are extremely catchy, and feel like parts of a whole. The snappy ""Indictment"" opens with self-incrimination (""I just wrote the dumbest song/ It's gonna be a sing along""), a prediction (""All our friends will clap and sing/ Our enemies will laugh and be pointing""), and Blake's own two cents (""It won't bother me""). He goes on: ""We could be the next group that you rob... It isn't who you know/ It's who you burn/ It means nothing/ Selling kids to other kids/ If you think we changed our tune, I hope we did."" ""Indictment"" is tongue-in-cheek, but there's a lot of truth to it. Schwarzenbach dug the knife in deeper with ""Boxcar"", which opens with the classic lines, ""You're not punk and I'm telling everyone/ Save your breath, I never was one"" and the sing-a-long chorus he promised in a song earlier: ""I was passing out when you were passing out your rules/ One, two, three, four/ Who's punk?/ What's the score?"" Again, always asking questions.</p>
<p>Though Schwarzenbach was the cult hero, it wasn't all about him: bassist Chris Bauermeister and drummer Adam Pfahler combined with Blake's serrated voice and guitar perfectly, creating songs that felt refined and raw, precise and shaggy. This is the sort of music where drum fills and bass lines function as major hooks; where the tone remains as lodged in your head as the words.</p>
<p>This <i>24 Hour Revenge Therapy</i> reissue, which is out on Pfahler's label, includes bonuses: dirtier alternative takes of the album tracks ""The Boat Dreams From the Hill"", ""Boxcar"", ""Do You Still Hate Me?"", ""Jinx"", and the outtakes ""First Step"" and ""Friends Back East"", which were included on the compilation <i>Etc.</i> All are interesting in providing context for the proper album, and it's worth hearing the different versions of otherwise familiar songs—like waking up earlier than normal and seeing the sunlight hit your kitchen in a way you hadn't before.</p>
<p>Mostly, it's just interesting to return to this music. Jawbreaker were never actually called ""emo"" at the time, at least not in my circles, but have been lumped in with the genre more than 20 years later. It's curious to see how the sound's been picked up and softened by the bands that came after—there are echoes of it, but nobody's nailed Jawbreaker's snarling mixture of tender and tough. Regardless of how it's framed or reframed, or what people decide to retroactively tag it, the music on <i>24 Hour Revenge Therapy</i> offers some of the most indelible examples of punk music crammed with emotion. These are life-changing songs that, a couple decades later, still give goosebumps.</p></div>"|19890.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19890-jawbreaker-24-hour-revenge-therapy/|9.1|Brandon Stosuy

It's a group that values collaboration, guesting on one another's albums and who, increasingly, are dipping their toes into popular music as producers and writers. “<a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2014/08/11/cover-story-kindness-finds-a-home-in-pop"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You’ll never guess who I just worked with</a>,” is, these days, a popular volley between Bainbridge and his former flat-mate Hynes, both now in-demand collaborators for more traditionally popular artists. They value the word ""pop,"" presumably, not because they want to be judged against current popular music but because defining yourself as a pop artist means never having to say you're sorry: you can work in whatever idiom you want, with whoever you want, in whatever manner. There's a freedom to pop music not availed to anyone who defines themselves as an indie rocker, or a punk, or a soul singer.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">One of the chief curiosities of <i>Otherness</i>, Bainbridge's second album as Kindness, is trying to understand what this freedom means in the context of his careful, quiet compositions. Bainbridge's music sounds nothing like the current maximalist strain of popular music, and it sounds only a little like certains kinds of popular music from decades past. It's more deliberate and varied than Bainbridge's debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16576-world-you-need-a-change-of-mind/""><i>World, You Need a Change of Mind</i></a>, a pleasant indie-disco record lacking in ambition.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Bainbridge aims higher on <i>Otherness</i>, setting his sights on pristine studio gems. He expands his arrangements, enlists collaborators (Hynes and Kelela chief among them), and dispenses with the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmqlDr-HrXw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/13268-swinging-party-replacements-cover/"">songs</a> that buoyed <i>World</i>. Bainbridge constructs his tracks largely with piano, horns, and bass, free of guitar. His lyrical currency is that most pop of topics: love lost and found. On <i>Otherness</i>, Bainbridge is a descendent of artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1670-peter-gabriel/"">Peter Gabriel</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7100-sting/"">Sting</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1479-bryan-ferry/"">Bryan Ferry</a>: self-serious rogues who whipped the undomesticated wilds of jazz, disco, and R&amp;B into digestible platters. Such is the M.O. of <i>Otherness</i>: throw everything at the wall, very tastefully.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Bainbridge is a standout producer, and <i>Otherness</i> crackles with crisp filigrees and luxe baubles. The soft-pedaled funk of tracks like ""Why Don't You Love Me"" and ""With You"" show lovely restraint, while welterweight breaks and brisk hi-hats keep ""World Restart"" and ""This Is Not About Us"" from blanching. ""I'll Be Back"" is a lavish, slo-mo house lullaby. There is a rare clarity and fidelity to <i>Otherness</i>' arrangements.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But, beautiful as they are, no one inhabits them. The only source of tension on <i>Otherness</i> is the disconnect between the album's sumptuous vistas and the dull songwriting that roams them. <i>Otherness</i> burdens its precision with unimaginative melodies and plodding tempos (""For the Young"", ""It'll Be Ok""). Bainbridge moans wanly during ""8th Wonder"" (""I'm thinking about my baby now/ Yeah"") before interrupting the track with a jarring guest verse (during which M.anifest shouts out Tracy Chapman's ""Fast Car"", lest you have any doubts about <i>Otherness</i>' smothering sincerity).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Bainbridge, doleful and even keeled on <i>World</i>, opens up his voice here but proves too thin and affectless for the kind of soulful interjections he wishes upon ""This Is Not About Us"" and ""I'll Be Back"". When <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/"">Robyn</a> takes lead on the jaunty ""Who Do You Love?"" the effect is like removing your earplugs at a concert, exposing yourself to an almost violent level of detail.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Most irksome is ""Geneva"", a musty, choral ballad that consists largely of one line—""If you could read my mind/ You know what you'd find""—repeated mantra-like through the song, something that initially scans as quiet reflection but quickly reveals itself to be gibberish (seriously: if you could read his mind—but you can't—you wouldn't even need to read his mind). ""Geneva"", one trifle repeated ad nauseam, is nearly six minutes long. <i>Otherness</i> is full of moments like this, drawn-out tiltings at romantic windmills that too often resolve themselves in near parody. When Hynes and Tawiah trade deep questions on ""Why Don't You Love Me"", they sound less like star-crossed lovers and more like two very confused people quixotically locked in song. ""With You"" features two sultry saxophone solos that mostly smack of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKpaTLMefiU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Simpsons</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TwSXvucsJ4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bill Clinton</a>.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-70fbe191-120e-1345-1b75-fcc537714c9c"">Pop music has plenty of tolerance for vapidity and emptiness, but you've got to be able to sell it. Look no further than Hynes' ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9gKVduzVEA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">It Is What It Is</a>"" if you want an example of a banality contorted into substance. You wonder if Bainbridge recognizes that something's missing: ""Making pop music that’s less immediate than other engineered pop, sometimes you need a helping hand that explains where it’s coming from or the emotional universe it lives in."" Maybe <i>Otherness</i>' emotional universe requires context, but who other than Bainbridge would provide it? <i>Otherness</i> isn't just less immediate than other pop music; it's less self-aware, and way less fun.</span></p></div>"|19937.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19937-kindness-otherness/|5.1|Andrew Gaerig

On the surface level Okereke’s stepping out as a dance producer was curious; it's not every day one of the more visible faces of 2000s UK indie steps behind the boards and starts churning out honest-to-God dance music on an honest-to-God dance label. But when it comes to explaining their existence alone, <i>Heartbreaker</i> and this year’s Crosstown-released <i>Candy Flip</i> EP make more sense when situated in what Okereke’s been up to over the last six years. Bloc Party’s 2008 effort, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12130-intimacy/""><i>Intimacy</i></a>, flirted with dancey textures to varied effect; two years later, Okereke stepped out on his own with proper solo debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14381-the-boxer/""><i>The Boxer</i></a>, a grab-baggy collection of aggressive dance-rock that, at points, presaged the stomping fare that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"">Skrillex</a> and other American dubstep auteurs would popularize a few years later.</p>
<p><i>The Boxer</i> wasn’t a very good album, but it was a hell of a lot better than Bloc Party’s defeated-sounding fourth record, the 2012 effort <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16944-four/""><i>Four</i></a>. A brittle, dry rock record that sounded as if the guys who made the youthful, comparatively bright <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1130-silent-alarm/""><i>Silent Alarm</i></a> seven years previous were battling a wicked hangover, <i>Four</i> made the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51145-bloc-party-to-take-another-extended-break/"">breakup rumors</a> that surrounded Bloc Party at the time sound appealing. It also suggested that, at least for the time being, Okereke had fallen out of love with rock music, an assumption bolstered by his second solo album, <i>Trick</i>. The record represents an even more headlong dive into dance music than <i>The Boxer</i>, with a decidedly different tone: Okereke’s swapped aggression for subtlety, embracing the type of lush, seedy big-room house music that, fittingly, Crosstown Rebels has made its name on.</p>
<p><i>Trick</i> is, by far, the most listenable and, at points, enjoyable music Okereke’s made this decade. Rock musicians dipping their toes into electronic waters isn’t new, but rarely do they make the transition sound effortless, and even more rare is the musician who can capably turn out stuff that sounds like it’s been blessed by the scene’s fixtures. That Okereke can claim success on both levels is, in itself, a small victory; compositionally, the ten tunes are sound and smooth, and if they were played for a listener under the false guise that Okereke simply contributed vocals to an established producer’s tracks, that listener would be none the wiser.</p>
<p>That said, the mode of dance music Okereke is working in on <i>Trick</i> is one frequently criticized by both dance aesthetes and genre newcomers as sounding faceless, and so it follows that <i>Trick</i> is nice with atmosphere, but largely a non-entity when it comes to hooks. The few memorable hooks it has, too, are unfortunately the album’s weaker points: “Year Zero”’s insistent, whining chorus isn’t made better by Okereke’s somewhat cringe-worthy lyrics. Okereke’s vocals have long possessed a stridency that worked well in the context of Bloc Party’s spiky, stylish post-post-punk, and when he breaks into the upper register in more subdued environs like the soft clicking thump of “My Hotel Room”, the effect is grating. There are moments of vocal subtlety as well, though, that fare much better: dusky closer “Stay the Night” radiates sensuality, Okereke’s upper register taking on a tone that’s a few shades darker to match his surroundings.</p>
<p><i>Trick</i> is a curious solo album because Okereke is more than content to take the backseat on his own tracks. Yasmin Shahmir, who’s previously collaborated with post-Disclosure UK house-pop duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31905-gorgon-city"">Gorgon City</a>, laces the percolating opener “First Impressions” gracefully, while vocalist Jodie Scantlebury takes the lead on the wistful, winding “Closer”, one of a few highlights and a tune possessing a chorus that smacks of something Todd Terry might have come up with in the early 90s. These inspired collaborations, along with more textural moments like the snappy diva shouts embedded in “Silver and Gold”, suggest that Okereke’s a capable, considerate producer that, next time around, might do even better with more time behind the boards and less in front of a microphone.</p></div>"|19782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19782-kele-trick/|6.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

Out of print for some 15 and 13 years respectively, Drexciya’s first full-length album statement <i>Neptune’s Lair</i> and Transllusion’s debut <i>The Opening of the Cerebral Gate</i> have finally been re-pressed, the latter with bonus tracks never before available on vinyl. On the surface, there seems little to connect these early '90s contemporaries—that is, the British cult-of-personality producer and two of the most obscure electronic music makers to ever call Detroit home. But the two acts shared labels, and it’s almost impossible to imagine the idiosyncratic music of Richard D. James without the insular yet profound example of Drexciya.</p>
<p>Masked and anonymous up until the death of James Stinson in September of 2002 from heart complications that signaled the end of the group, the duo of Stinson and Gerald Donald left behind a staggering yet fragmented body of work. The group only released three full-lengths (with both <i>Harnessed the Storm</i> and <i>Grava 4</i> being released in the months before Stinson’s death), Drexciya’s decade-long run of singles and EPs were singular in electronic music, connecting the likes of Detroit’s Underground Resistance to European imprints like Clone and Tresor. </p>
<p>They also presented a unified vision spanning across those singles and albums, a world of sound that soundtracked a dystopian future while paying tribute to forefathers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6208-george-clinton/"">George Clinton</a>, the Jonzun Crew, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11268-cybotron/"">Cybotron</a>, and of course <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a> (see “Aquabahn”). While the excellent Clone series <i>Journey of the Deep Sea Dweller</i> painstakingly compiled and presented four volumes of Drexciyan music, they never quite put together the backstory of the group. Nevermind that they grew up landlocked in Detroit—Donald and Stinson created a warped water world peopled with Darthouven fish men, Stingray battalions, and Lardossan cruisers shaped like giant squids.</p>
<p>And how did such fish men wind up 20,000 leagues under the sea? Why, via pregnant African women thrown overboard during the Middle Passage of course, as brutal a creation story as any in modern music. Couched in such real-world horror is a layer of science fiction queasiness, like touching fish flesh. As an early comp's liner notes described: “Are Drexciyans water-breathing aquatically mutated descendants of those unfortunate victims of human greed? Recent experiments have shown a premature human infant saved from certain death by breathing liquid oxygen through its underdeveloped lungs.”</p>
<p>Drexciya’s bleak outlook was matched by a brutal strain of electro, acid, and techno across those initial 12”s.

<p>Even Stinson’s <i>The Opening of the Cerebral Gate</i> offers up a slightly more moderate variation on the Drexciyan template. “Transmission of Life” is built on a furious throb and submarine alarms and the unreal squalls of “Cerebral Cortex Malfunction” sound exactly like its title suggests, but elsewhere Stinson tempers such overdriven tendencies.

Out of print for some 15 and 13 years respectively, Drexciya’s first full-length album statement <i>Neptune’s Lair</i> and Transllusion’s debut <i>The Opening of the Cerebral Gate</i> have finally been re-pressed, the latter with bonus tracks never before available on vinyl. On the surface, there seems little to connect these early '90s contemporaries—that is, the British cult-of-personality producer and two of the most obscure electronic music makers to ever call Detroit home. But the two acts shared labels, and it’s almost impossible to imagine the idiosyncratic music of Richard D. James without the insular yet profound example of Drexciya.</p>
<p>Masked and anonymous up until the death of James Stinson in September of 2002 from heart complications that signaled the end of the group, the duo of Stinson and Gerald Donald left behind a staggering yet fragmented body of work. The group only released three full-lengths (with both <i>Harnessed the Storm</i> and <i>Grava 4</i> being released in the months before Stinson’s death), Drexciya’s decade-long run of singles and EPs were singular in electronic music, connecting the likes of Detroit’s Underground Resistance to European imprints like Clone and Tresor. </p>
<p>They also presented a unified vision spanning across those singles and albums, a world of sound that soundtracked a dystopian future while paying tribute to forefathers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6208-george-clinton/"">George Clinton</a>, the Jonzun Crew, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11268-cybotron/"">Cybotron</a>, and of course <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a> (see “Aquabahn”). While the excellent Clone series <i>Journey of the Deep Sea Dweller</i> painstakingly compiled and presented four volumes of Drexciyan music, they never quite put together the backstory of the group. Nevermind that they grew up landlocked in Detroit—Donald and Stinson created a warped water world peopled with Darthouven fish men, Stingray battalions, and Lardossan cruisers shaped like giant squids.</p>
<p>And how did such fish men wind up 20,000 leagues under the sea? Why, via pregnant African women thrown overboard during the Middle Passage of course, as brutal a creation story as any in modern music. Couched in such real-world horror is a layer of science fiction queasiness, like touching fish flesh. As an early comp's liner notes described: “Are Drexciyans water-breathing aquatically mutated descendants of those unfortunate victims of human greed? Recent experiments have shown a premature human infant saved from certain death by breathing liquid oxygen through its underdeveloped lungs.”</p>
<p>Drexciya’s bleak outlook was matched by a brutal strain of electro, acid, and techno across those initial 12”s. But what makes <i>Neptune’s Lair</i> and Stinson’s own <i>The Opening of the Cerebral Gate </i>great portals into that waterworld is that <i>Neptune</i>'s 21 tracks temper those bludgeoning machinistic beats with other sounds: evocative acid tracks that take you deep inside your own mind, spasmodic electro sprints, strange interludes, and the sort of off-kilter melodic bits that Aphex Twin would soon make his own.</p>

I saw his piece <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrai3NGDUMM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>FAR</i> </a>a couple years ago, and hearing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5924-ben-frost/"">Ben Frost</a>'s delicate yet concussive score, then unreleased, was as rich a part of the experience as watching the dance. McGregor has also commissioned music from the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3641-max-richter/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Max Richter</a> (<i>Sum </i>and <i>Infra</i>) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28532-olafur-arnalds/"">Ólafur Arnalds</a> (<i>Dyad 1909</i>), and you can add to that list <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29727-a-winged-victory-for-the-sullen/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">A Winged Victory for the Sullen</a>, a collaboration between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3935-stars-of-the-lid/"">Stars of the Lid</a>'s Adam Wiltzie and pianist Dustin O'Halloran. Their score for <a href=""http://vimeo.com/82094427"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>ATOMOS</i></a> recasts the elegant sound of their 2011 debut for McGregor's purposes, with pensive melancholy shading into physical menace.</p>
<p>If Stars of the Lid's music sounds like a hollowed-out 100-piece ensemble with ether for its innards, AWVFTS is the opposite. Made from strings, piano, the occasional horn, and electric guitars processed into ambient washes and scrawls, it's all inner voices coiled together, more classical than drone. The music is recorded in large spaces, so that between natural acoustic and electronic effects, every instrument seems to float in an ocean-sized force field of harmonic resonance. Minimal melodic information carries maximal tone, the few voices somehow resplendently full and forlornly isolated at once. </p>
<p>McGregor choreographs for a <a href=""http://www.randomdance.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">leading modern company</a>, London's <a href=""http://www.roh.org.uk/people/wayne-mcgregor"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Royal Ballet</a>, and, occasionally, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOa1a8hYP8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thom Yorke</a>. Rather than making his experimental work challenging and his traditional work beautiful, he makes all of his work both, building modern movement on ballet lines. This classically tempered novelty influences his musical commissions, where chamber music anchors electronic disturbances and asymmetrical structures. AWVFTS adapts, making <i>ATOMOS</i> louder and more mobile than its impeccably tentative predecessor—more volatile and disjointed, with basses you can feel in your body because this is for the body. The duo's signature stasis is now packed with interior movement; particles swarm through drones like dancers suspended in stage lighting.</p>
<p>If the first album was basically slow-moving, deeply sonorous chamber music under a microscope, <i>ATOMOS </i>pumps up elements of discord and chaos. The duo's usual minimalist classical core, formed somewhere between the sacred and nervy repetitions of Arvo Pärt and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6177-philip-glass"">Philip Glass</a>, is reshaped in accord with influential dance scorers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28904-gavin-bryars/"">Gavin Bryars</a> and David Tudor. Slabs of hard, bright organ-like tones arc powerfully over dark crags of bass. Strings twist in relentless screw-like figures or creep forward in inexorably widening harmonies. Electronic guitar tones are more pronounced, forming rhythmic throughlines and pulses. Forbidding abstract landscapes rise up into plangent songs, sub-frequencies crumbling apart beneath them.</p>
<p>The best tracks, such as ""I"" and ""VI"", wrangle these maneuvers into an anxious, dynamic, almost symphonic sweep. All the song titles are Roman numerals—too bad, as it deprives us of the duo's unusually self-mocking song titles. Grandiose ambient musicians are not known for their sense of humor, so titles such as ""Steep Hills of Vicodin Tears"", ""Requiem for the Static King"" and, best of all, ""We Played Some Open Chords"" (they did!) were refreshing. But there's still something curious about this tracklist. There is no ""IV"". What went wrong? I like to imagine that one day this lost track will surface, and it will have a kazoo in it. For now, it brings a touch of mystery to a far better than average dance score that refines rather than suppresses the musical identity of its creators. Who will Wayne McGregor call on next? <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"">Tim Hecker</a>'s phone has got to be about to ring.  </p></div>"|19868.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19868-a-winged-victory-for-the-sullen-atomos/|7.3|Brian Howe

Days before the noise artist was supposed to go on her first European tour, doctors discovered a cyst so large it almost brought on organ failure. The subsequent surgery and healing process was long and intense. During the weeks of bed rest, a dying man lay next to her in the hospital, crying out for his daughter to join his side. For whatever reason, she never showed up.</p>
<p>In the rearview, Chardiet’s situation sounds like hell, and so does her latest album as Pharmakon, <i>Bestial Burden</i>. In <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9481-pharmakon/"">a recent interview with Pitchfork</a>, she described the theme of her second LP for Brooklyn-based label Sacred Bones as “[a] desire to show the body as a lump of flesh and cells that mutate and fail you and betray you—this very banal, unimportant, grotesque aspect of ourselves.” It’s a grim focus on the corporeal, a lens that Chardiet has projected her nightmarish music through before; on last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18009-pharmakon-abandon/""><i>Abandon</i></a>, the roaring final track was gruesomely titled “Crawling on Bruised Knees”, the cover art a shot of Chardiet’s lower torso covered in maggots. On the cover of <i>Bestial Burden</i>, she literally turns the inside outwards, with grisly-looking butcher’s-shop organs placed accordingly on her upper torso and chicken talons glued to her fingers.</p>
<p>Musically, <i>Bestial Burden</i> is a considerable step forwards for Chardiet, a feat that’s more impressive when considering that the genre she works in doesn’t necessarily call for artistic growth. Before releasing <i>Abandon</i>, Chardiet established her presence with a run of small-press releases similar to many noise musicians past and present, so that record wasn’t so much her debut as it was an introduction to a somewhat wider audience. If the depth-charge blasts of <i>Abandon</i> showcased an exciting emerging voice in experimental music, <i>Bestial Burden</i> elevates Chardiet to an even more accomplished plane. The sense of control that she wields over this nasty, fire-breathing music—a push-and-push-harder tension between pummeling rhythms, swaths of power-electronics static, and her impressive, chilling howl—provides a sense of structure that makes this very out-there music easy to grasp for those outside of noise music circles. </p>
<p>Still, chaos reigns on <i>Bestial Burden</i>, an album that sounds like anything but a safe space to inhabit. Chardiet’s steadier focus on rhythm provides a sound structure nonetheless annihilated by jet-engine roars, bursts of mechanical heat, and ear-bleeding screeches. Paradoxically, the harshest and most alienating moments on <i>Bestial Burden</i> arrive when the record is at its quietest: album opener “Vacuum” practically serves as a portal into the record’s landscape, as Chardiet’s vocal hyperventilation is backed by a undulating fuzzy drone that rubs against the ears like a drill to the teeth. “Primitive Struggle” lays wet, heaving coughs over a heartbeat-like rhythm that eventually grows to an insistent thud, bleeding beautifully into the death-march stomp of “Autoimmune”. By turning the human body’s failures into rhythmic tools at her disposal, Chardiet has created the truest form of body horror.</p>
<p>Fittingly, her voice is the album's most expressive instrument, at times recalling black metal’s pitchless burn. While her vocal approach on <i>Abandon</i> came across as sprawling and freeform in its presentation, Chardiet takes the shape of a menacing furnace on <i>Bestial Burden</i>, giving off blasts of heat and steam that are deeply felt even as they recede into the darkness. In <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9091-pharmakon/"">the aforementioned interview</a>, Chardiet groused about the reception her difficult music receives: “When I put that out to someone and the only thing they can say is, ‘Oh look, it’s a girl screaming,’ I want to fucking kill them because I’m literally pouring my heart and soul out, being so vulnerable.” On <i>Bestial Burden</i>, her voice casts jagged, threatening shadows, but on a record that concerns itself with bodily disintegration, Chardiet’s forcefulness is a necessary human constant.</p>
<p>Her most surprising performance arrives on the album’s closing title track, seven minutes of pulsing tones that culminates in tangled noise and mutated vocal strangulation. Before “Bestial Burden”’s satisfyingly destructive conclusion, though, Chardiet expresses herself in a way that stands apart from the rest of the six-track record; her voice sways and swerves with disorienting clarity, sounding almost psychedelic with every half-spoken dispatch. Chardiet has played it straight previously when it comes to her vocals—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54703-pharmakon-covers-chernancy-sinatra-song-bang-bang-my-baby-shot-me-down/"">her cover of “Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)”</a>, featured on Sacred Bones’ 2013 compilation <i>Todo Muere Vol 4</i>, was surprisingly faithful to the original—but the wavy, near-meditative form of “Bestial Burden” is, at least for those who just arrived to the Pharmakon party a year ago, unexplored territory. As a whole, <i>Bestial Burden</i> highlights Chardiet’s ability to re-draw the boundaries of her own artistic approach, ripping out its guts and creating something new out of the decaying remains.</p></div>"|19871.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19871-pharmakon-bestial-burden/|8.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

Which meant…what exactly? It meant we got <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25250-candlebox/"">Candlebox</a> and Seven Mary Three. It meant that <i>Nevermind</i> made a lot of people a lot of money, and that needed to happen again, and then more times after that too.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Imagine being in a band in the Northwest then. Hoping to maybe do it full time so you don’t have to work your shitty job and can go on tour without feeling bad about leaving your life and any semblance of financial security behind. Then imagine some A&amp;R rep coming to your town, because it’s the Northwest, and because you’re in a band with guitars and maybe those guitars have the right amount of fuzz on them so that, if that A&amp;R rep wants to pretend hard enough, maybe you could be as successful as Nirvana. That was either exactly what you wanted, or completely terrifying.</p>
<p class=""p1"">I’m not claiming that Olympia-based <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4427-unwound/"">Unwound</a> (they were technically from the neighboring, less hip town of Tumwater, but one kind of bleeds into the other anyway) were ever going to be as big as Nirvana. No one could possibly think that. Nor do they seem like the kind band that would particularly enjoy overbearing major label interference. It’s more about what they did with what they had. If you’re part of a specific subset of music listener, they are the pinnacle of a very specific type of insular rock music that is rigid and forward thinking and pushes boundaries even as it works within the system those boundaries have created.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But every cult-favorite gets their due, so here we are, three box sets into <a href=""http://www.numerogroup.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Numero Group</a>’s tireless retrospective. Knowing what we know now, <i>No Energy</i>—which covers 1995’s <i>The Future of What</i> and 1996’s career-defining <i>Repetition</i>, as well as an assortment of live cuts and B-sides from the era—is the buildup before the band’s swan song, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8365-leaves-turn-inside-you/""><i>Leaves Turn Inside You</i></a>, a double album that touched on post-rock and modern classical and just about every other genre (including some that maybe were invented on that record) with all the autumnal verve of a group of musicians that seemed to suddenly realize they had been stockpiling so much constrained emotion for so long, that all they could do was release it and then quit working together.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>No Energy</i> is essential even without that information. Listening to these box sets in order (don’t do it all at once), Unwound’s growth is clear: they moved from scrappy punk band with interesting ideas to a musically precise machine, harnessing feedback squalls, goopy drums, and guitars that sounded like they were repeatedly bashed against a brick wall, in an effort to approach dark transcendental bliss through repetition and coiled tension. </p>
<p class=""p1"">In the liner notes for <i>No Energy</i>, drummer Sara Lund writes, “We learned to communicate absolutely with our instruments, and while we were playing together, all personal tensions were erased. This band played with intention, never intending anything specific beyond honest expression.” If you think about Unwound from this angle, the band is cast in a spiritual light, and it makes sense. So much of the music here, from “Natural Disasters” to “Disappoint” to the fuzzed out tonal scrape of “Vern’s Answer to the Masses”, is head-spinning and angry, but very deeply so. Like Lund, bassist Vern Rumsey, and guitarist/singer Justin Trosper had made peace with whatever was roiling inside them by obsessively pushing it outward. </p>
<p class=""p1"">You can hear it on “Corpse Pose”, presented here in two forms, and as close to a signature Unwound song as you’re going to get. A walking bassline is almost immediately cut through with stabs of guitar that sound like what would happen if grunge quit aiming for cheesy guitar solos and played around with post-punk’s empty space. On its own, “Corpse Pose” makes a case for <i>Repetition</i> as the definitive Unwound album, but that doesn’t mean it eclipses the other gems to be found on the second half of this set: “Lowest Common Denominator” lurches and sways, with Trosper singing in a deadpan that leans toward simmering rage, and “For Your Entertainment” is basically a preview of the Unwound that would come later: Trosper’s voice oscillates between a blocky scream and an elliptical monotone.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The Unwound we hear on <i>No Energy</i> is a prime version of the band. They’re still straddling their punk roots and their experimental side with ease: dipping into dub on the soft, completely bizarre-in-this-context “Sensible”, playing with time signatures on the hectic “Murder Movies”. The songs here careen. This is the sound of a band that has no interest in saving any of their ideas for later, or calming down to think about what they’re doing. Amidst all the sonic density, there’s an audible joy of creation, even in retrospect, knowing that they would soon fall apart. Lund backs this up in the liner notes, writing that as the band’s “personal bonds dissipated, the music only got stronger.” She also mentions that communication was never their strong suit, which is key to understanding how this band worked so well, and also how it eventually stopped working.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The one constant through every Unwound album is that the trio, and assorted contributors, worked with a set of unspoken, nearly primal rules: feedback dissolves into nothing and riffs repeat hypnotically to the point that they sound like they’re about to crust over and splinter. Trosper, Lund, and Rumsey made music almost telepathically—they wrote on impulse and without pretension. They’re unique because they did this with so much control. Every note here sounds carefully considered, and just as carefully, every idea is left hanging before it can fully be seen through. There is no payoff except the lack of payoff. Once you accept that, their music becomes meditative. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Unwound are complicated enough to stay a cult favorite forever, but Numero’s reissue campaign goes a long way to placing them in the context they deserve. Listening now, they are still the kind of band that you can cherish deeply. They were so good at expressing alienation and discontent, that loving them said something about the way your brain worked and where you were willing to let your thoughts go. Nothing’s changed.</p></div>"|19926.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19926-unwound-no-energy/|8.6|Sam Hockley-Smith

This is the quietest record I've heard since Bernhard Günter and Francisco Lopez's hushed microsound works from the turn of the millennium. It is so quiet that you'll need to turn the volume up very, very loud to hear it well, or indeed, at all. In my case, that involves several steps—one volume control on the laptop, one on the audio interface, and one on the DJ mixer that it all runs through on the way to a pair of studio monitors—as well as closing the window in order to shield Drumm's filament-like drones from the rumble of traffic outside. Suffice to say, this is an album that requires some effort, and part of that effort might involve just sitting still. </p>
<p class=""p1"">I thought I might get some multi-tasking done—file maintenance, email cleanup, general absent-minded mousing around—while I sat and zoned out to a first run-through of what might be the Chicago noise musician's most ethereal recording since 2009's <i>Imperial Horizon</i>. But I had forgotten about the computer's default alert sounds, and when I went to delete a document, I was startled by the noise that suddenly tore through my speakers—a sound like boots crunching through snow, almost painfully loud. The sound, of course, came not from Drumm's Worse than Burning Offal studios, but from a lab in Cupertino. But it was tempting to imagine that moment of sonic violence as a part of the piece, in a way. Kevin Drumm wants your full attention, and he has mastered <i>Trouble </i>in such a way to practically guarantee it.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Another, perhaps better, option is just to leave the album on in the background at a natural, almost inaudible volume, and let it sink in like incense. That's the same line of thinking behind <i>Imperial Horizon</i>'s lone, hour-long track ""Just Lay Down and Forget It"", presumably. I can think of few passive listens that might be <i>less</i> taxing than this shimmering, 54-minute piece, divided into two halves and separated by a minute or two of actual, total silence. As far as wallpaper music goes, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11731-discreet-musicambient-1-music-for-airportsambient-2-the-plateaux-of-mirror-with-harold-buddambient-4-on-land/""><i>Music for Airports</i></a> scans as a clash of gaudy op-art prints compared to Drumm's almost invisible layer of atmosphere. Still, per the title, Drumm's disappearing act amounts to a kind of uneasy listening, even at an almost imperceptible volume. This is the sound of fingertips slowly tracing crystal rims; of whale song heard from the opposite end of the ocean; of ghost trains braking in the dead of night. It is the sound of mountains slumping and mist settling. Its deathless peal is a dead ringer for the music of the spheres—all that friction, all that reverb, nothing but shivering frequencies, from here to the ends of the known universe. It's the ghostly microwaves of cosmic background radiation.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Despite Drumm's noisy reputation, his music can be overwhelmingly sensual even at its loudest. <i>Sheer Hellish Miasma</i>'s ""Hitting the Pavement"", for instance, is a full-body rubdown of distortion—part airplane engine, part power sander, yet still, above all, a welcoming embrace. And that goes a thousand-fold for the sublime <i>Trouble</i>, an album that invites you to dive into its clutches with the promise of never hitting bottom. The noise floor is a very, very long way down.</p></div>"|19880.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19880-kevin-drumm-trouble/|7.8|Philip Sherburne

(You really need to commit to pronouncing a word like that.) Those are all qualities that end up characterizing the band’s third record, <i>We Come From the Same Place</i>. Formed by a group of Australian expats in London around the turn of the decade, the band began their career with two strong records chock-full of quirky, culturally savvy songs, flecked by lead singer Elizabeth Morris’ ukulele and her various passions: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/696-johnny-cash/"">Johnny Cash</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3786-silver-jews/"">Silver Jews</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJ7FVYKXsyg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Woody Allen”</a>. And while the band has some obvious sonic antecedents—the bookish, thickly accented pop of groups like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"">Belle and Sebastian</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/662-camera-obscura/"">Camera Obscura</a>, the finely detailed English scenes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/777-the-clientele/"">the Clientele</a>—those records were proof positive that the potential for pastiche can always be transcended by quality songwriting.</p>
<p>The band’s logistics have become significantly more complicated since the release of the 2012 sophomore effort <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16502-europe/""><i>Europe</i></a>: Morris got married and left London for Florence, a change that specifically impacted the composition of the album’s last three songs. The transitional period served as excellent songwriting fodder for a band that’s taken with the concept of change, whether it’s in regards to time, location, or relationship status. They excel at finding glory and drama in transitional periods where characters’ perspectives begin to shift and warp, and they manage to lend relatively mundane activities like drinking with your friends—there’s a surprising amount of alcohol mentioned in these songs—a romance and significance that demands your investment.</p>
<p>Morris has a great touch when working with scene setting and small pieces of imagery—a row of crappy student bars on the rollicking “Kings and Queens”, a foreign cityscape at night on “Santa Maria Novella”—which makes the album feel fully inhabited and lively. All of the world-building culminates in frank, tightly written kernels of wisdom that sneak up on you and take your breath away. On “Kings and Queens”, Morris admits that “I wanted to impress you/ And I think you knew”; on “Santa Maria Novella”, written after her move to Florence, she reflects: “And I know that no one likes a tourist/ I feel like I’m one here.” Perhaps the most devastating line is the one that hammers home the breathtaking “Angela”, a would-be standard love story flipped into a tale of friendship and support and hammered home with the following couplet: “The hardest thing we ever have to learn / Is when those we love don’t love us in return.” It’s easy to find your own life detailed in these songs, and they’re helped along by arrangements that are brisk, propulsive, and remarkably unadorned, allowing the crackling drumming and pristine guitar melodies to shine.</p>
<p><i>We Come From the Same Place</i> is at its weakest when it occasionally slips away from real emotional impact into more cloying and saccharine territory. “Bright Eyes” follows aforementioned highlight “Angela”, and while guitarist Paul Rains gives it his all in a duet with Morris, his thick, sweet voice atop big, bright chords carries the potential to induce a sugar coma, as does the chipped ukulele and severe tenderness of “Heartbeat”. It's almost impossible to imagine those who like their pop music sharp-edged to take to this album's rounded corners. Nonetheless, the title of <i>We Come From the Same Place</i> sums up its comforts nicely: it’s a warm, deeply rooted, familiar statement indicative of a real, earned connection.</p></div>"|19758.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19758-allo-darlin-we-come-from-the-same-place/|7.2|Jamieson Cox

All the hallmarks of that vintage sound are there: the tinny snares, rattling like an ice cube in a small plastic box; bass that sounds like plucked bridge cables; guitars that crunch like scrap metal sliding into rush-hour traffic. It's extremely close and far away all at once, evoking chilly basement practice spaces draped in moth-eaten moving blankets, and the atmosphere is deathly dry, as though a packet of silica powder had spilled across <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division"">Joy Division</a>'s <i>Unknown Pleasures</i>, soaking up all the ambient reverb.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Institute are of the here and now, though; they hail from Austin, TX, and share members with Wiccans, Glue, Blotter, and Recide. The project began as a set of four-track sketches made by singer Moses Brown, and a full-band demo turned into Institute's six-song, self-titled <a href=""https://derangedrecords.bandcamp.com/album/s-t-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">debut EP</a>, released in February on British Columbia's Deranged Records. The <a href=""https://institute.bandcamp.com/album/giddy-boys-7"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Giddy Boys</i></a> 7"" followed, on Katorga Works. Both of those records laid out the basics of Institute's sound in two and three-minute blasts, tarnished and ragged, with Brown's pained voice—part wail, part sigh, vaguely reminiscent of Darby Crash's wasted whine—as the cherry on the lopsided, fist-mashed cake. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The <i>Salt </i>EP builds upon that foundation in subtle ways. The production is just as tarnished, just as ragged, but the elements have snapped ever so slightly more into focus. The songwriting feels sharper, and the hooks sink deeper. ""Salt"" opens the record on a high point, setting a bassline that flashes back to ""She's Lost Control"" over rolling, skipping, ""tribal"" drums straight out of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5439-siouxsie-sioux/"">Siouxsie</a>'s <i>The Scream</i>. Whatever else Brown might be croaking, in a voice so hoarse you want to give him hot lemon-and-honey water and tuck him into bed, ""It don't mean shit!"" cuts clearly through the murk. ""Nausea"", just a minute long, flies by in a blur of hardscrabble bass-and-guitar counterpoints, dissonant and sere. Gazing in the mirror, Brown offers a bleakly deadpan take on the divided self—""He looks like me, yet he mocks me/ We spend some time together, we spend our lives together/ I desire the experience of a moment alone""—that builds to an climax of dashed hopes (""To be free/ Is the worst prison!"") with every glance in the looking glass.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""Familiar Stranger"" also carries an echo of <i>Unknown Pleasures</i>, with a rickety twang that might be a particularly Texan response to ""Disorder"". Its structure is odd, a set of eight- and 16-bar modules snapped together like an Erector set. It builds without ever reaching a climax, and ends as though falling off a cliff—barreling ahead one moment, and gone the next. Brown's multi-tracked voice sounds like it's been filtered through a broken microphone; <i>he </i>sounds broken, which is part of what makes him such a compelling presence. On ""Immorality"", he sounds like he's about to come undone, swatting in the dark at images he'd rather hold at bay. He cites the painter <a href=""http://www.ericfischl.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eric Fischl</a> and gestures darkly at ""a sewer to drain swollen needs of Christian men"". When it comes to the cathartic chorus (""Immorality's neat!""), you don't know whether to laugh or cry. </p>
<p class=""p1"">It all comes to a head with ""An Absence"", the closing song, and, at just over four minutes long, the record's longest by a considerable margin. It begins with ringing open fifths over a relaxed, almost regal drumbeat, the guitars like sheets of liquid glass. Brown's dejected voice is more sob than speech. The bass shifts for the chorus: a minor second, sweet discord; you want to curl up inside it, in a ball, like a cornered animal, shivering in time with the dissonance. We're back to Siouxsie territory with this one—it's a ragtag ""Jigsaw Feeling"", maybe, run through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a>'s pedals circa <i>EVOL </i>or <i>Sister</i>. It's breathtaking, particularly in its climax, which feels like a bar of metal being wrenched from its fittings, and it goes to the heart of Institute's obvious promise: for all their resemblance to deathrock and post-punk greats of yore, there's nothing mannered or simulacral about them. They are as real as the lump in your throat and the salt under your nails, and their sting couldn't be sweeter.</p></div>"|19881.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19881-institute-salt-ep/|7.4|Philip Sherburne

The lesson of <i>good kid</i>—that you could make radio without catering to it—seems lost as L.A. revels in a renewed commercial relevance.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Long Beach rapper Vince Staples is sick of cheery street rap. “If you listen to shit about niggas being in a position where they have no hope, there should be nothing at peace about that,” he said in a recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9489-vince-staples/"">interview with Pitchfork</a>. “There’s a way to do it where it’s listenable and likable, but it shouldn’t just be some happy stuff.” Staples’ own body of work rests on a nervous axis between expressive, imagistic wordplay and somber cynicism. There’s pessimism in the opportunism. There’s stress in the joy. At his peppiest—the chorus of “Feelin’ the Love”, perhaps, the closer on his just-released retail debut <i>Hell Can Wait</i>—he’s still waving at death: “Is you feelin’ amazing? Yeah I’m feelin’ the love/ Hope I get to take it with me when my living is done.”</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Hell Can Wait </i>is a reminder that living is another word for cheating death. It’s bleak and maybe exasperating, but the reality of the street is that babies gotta eat, jobs are scarce, and some people have to resort to tactics that risk death and imprisonment to make it through the day. There’s no wide-eyed good kid narrating the disorder in Staples' city, just a realist making do with the available options. “Niggas from my home ain’t enrolled in the colleges/ Fuck a class, junkies hitting glass, get the money long,” Vince snarls on “65 Hunnid”. On “Screen Door” he balks at the popularity of imaginary gangsters, asserting that his own home was rawer than any Hollywood adaptation: “Bobby Johnson ain’t my OG/ This ain’t no movie role/ Pops was off the OE/ Tripping, getting his Tookie on.”</p>
<p class=""p1"">In the middle of the EP Staples' ire sharpens into an icepick. “Hands Up” protests LAPD's use of excessive force (“They expect respect and nonviolence/ I refuse the right to be silent”) in a diatribe <a href=""https://twitter.com/vincestaples/status/509428806822526976"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Staples swears isn’t about Ferguson</a>. But in a climate where surveillance cam and cell phone footage have revealed law enforcement bullying and violence against black bodies for a near-daily operation, “Hands Up”’s volatile objection to “Paying taxes for some fucking clowns to ride around whooping niggas’ asses” hits hard from coast to coast. Lead single “Blue Suede” is a curt rejoinder about gang violence being deadly too; the terse chorus—“New shoes with the blue suede/ Young graves get the bouquets”—folds a lifetime of adversity into just a few words, a series of damning images cataloguing the disintegration of hope. </p>
<p class=""p1"">That economy is <i>Hell Can Wait</i>’s guiding principle. Staples never wastes a word in exhibiting a hustler’s hard-won resilience, and he’s abetted by producers that buoy his stories without overwhelming them. Leading the charge is Toronto producer Hagler (best known for a co-producer credit on Drake’s “Trophies”). Hagler gifts “Screen Door” and “Limos” their hypnotic poise, but he truly shines on “Blue Suede”, which sounds like a trap artist’s rendering of the moment Dr. Dre thought to slap high pitched Moog lines over breaks, the resulting menace tracing a line of ancestry between L.A.’s riots and Raiders era and today. Elsewhere Lil Wayne associate Infamous effects a Nawlins death march for “65 Hunnid”, and Staples' mentor and label head No I.D. outfits “Hands Up” with a guttural low end fitting of a song that could be considered a spiritual successor to “Fuck tha Police”.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Hell Can Wait </i>is a debut for Staples, but it’s really a refinement, the end result of a years long search for the right producer that spawned a string of good but not always great mixtapes and loosies. Even a casual listener could hear the spark—Staples' first fame came from getting the best of known mic terrorist Earl Sweatshirt—but his production values have finally caught up enough to push him past the scrappy sidekick division into the big leagues. In an era where signing to a major label can mean artistic regression, Vince Staples’ jump to Def Jam is a case study in the enduring merit of good old-fashioned artist development. The machine still works sometimes.</p></div>"|19849.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19849-vince-staples-hell-can-wait-ep/|8.5|Craig Jenkins

By the time it appeared in 1996, the Scottish duo had released a minor armload of cassettes and 12-inches, all of it in extraordinarily limited editions. But, for all the general public knew, it may as well have been their debut, given the way it arrived like a bolt from the aquamarine. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Even if you lived it, it's getting hard to remember what it was like to discover music back then. But when <i>Hi Scores</i> began turning up in record bins, not only were listeners unlikely to know much about who they were or where the record came from, there were precious few ways of finding out. The snail-mail address listed on the insert sheet was just a P.O. box. A strip of Braille adorned the cover, heightening the record's cryptic aspect. And the name of the label, <a href=""http://www.skam.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Skam</a>, lent a vaguely unsavory air to it all. On Hyperreal's IDM listserv, it was ventured that Boards of Canada might be a synonym of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"">Autechre</a> or Mike Paradinas, or some combination of them.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It's useful to try to return to that state of ignorance, if only because so many layers of myth have been woven around the duo since then, a dense cocoon of fantasy and obfuscation. Some of that has been their own doing, like the coded 12-inches they distributed on Record Store Day last year as a pre-announcement of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18104-boards-of-canada-tomorrows-harvest/""><i>Tomorrow's Harvest</i></a>—Willy Wonka's golden tickets as re-imagined by William Gibson. And some of it seems to have been the result of an obsessive fanbase hopped up on rabbit holes and Easter eggs. (From the fan site <a href=""http://bocpages.org/wiki/Hi_Scores_(release)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bocpages.org</a>: ""It has been suggested that the 'hi' of 'hi scores' could refer to the initials of BoC's alias Hell Interface."" Well, yes, quite; and so might we connect the duo's reclusive tendencies to the fact that one anagram of the group's name is ""A Bad Raccoons Fad"").</p>
<p class=""p1"">But <i>Hi Scores</i> preceded all of that. There are ample clues of the kind of artists they'd become with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/838-music-has-the-right-to-children/""><i>Music Has the Right to Children</i></a>, released just two years later, and not just because ""Turquoise Hexagon Sun"" is included here in an identical version. Five of the six tracks occupy the head-nodding, mid-tempo range that remains the duo's narcotic wheelhouse. Sampled breakbeats drive most of the songs here, but they sound different from the scratchy, dust-encrusted breaks that instrumental hip-hop producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1113-dj-shadow/"">DJ Shadow</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1108-dj-krush/"">DJ Krush</a> were using around the same time; Boards of Canada's breaks snap and thud with a weirdly rigid motion, and they're fleshed out with metallic drum-machine sounds, like the boxy snares of ""Nlogax"" and the dry, deflated hi-hats of ""Seeya Later"", that glint dully against the murk. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The duo's tonal tendencies were already well developed: all six tracks feature their trademark four-bar chord progressions and cycling contrapuntal melodies. The air is uniformly wistful, full of chimes and shimmering arpeggios and buzzing, tubular tones, like singing ghosts heard through a drainpipe. And while they don't wade as far into the lysergic depths that would distinguish <i>Music Has the Right to Children</i>—all those hazy, soft-focus tones meant to evoke the nostalgia of old nature films and washed-out Super 8—their synthesizers, subtly detuned, have a woozy, watery feel, slippery as something half-remembered. And on ""Turquoise Hexagon Sun"", the sound of distant voices anticipates the playground <i>concrète</i><b> </b>vibes of <i>Music </i>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/837-geogaddi/""><i>Geogaddi</i></a>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But <i>Hi Scores</i> might be most exciting for the way it breaks from their later work. The title track, soaked in faraway buzz, as though it had been recorded beneath high-voltage power lines, offers up an overdriven growl that's reminiscent of Aphex Twin's ""Ventolin"". It's unusually muscular for them, and the same could be said of ""June 9th"", whose laser zaps and faintly industrial crunch recall Autechre and Disjecta. And the best track on the whole release might be ""Nlogax"", a snapping electro cut with a break reportedly sampled from Indeep's ""Last Night a D.J. Saved My Life""; with the exception of the Hell Interface remix of ""Midas Touch"", it's probably the funkiest thing Boards of Canada have ever done. And played back at 45 RPM, it turns into shuddering, head-spinning techno—a tantalizing example of a path the duo could have taken, but never did. </p>
<p class=""p1"">It's not quite clear why, exactly, <i>Hi Scores</i> is getting re-released now. (A publicist notes that this is Skam's 20th anniversary, but that's debatable; 1994 was the year of the Autechre offshoot Gescom's self-titled EP, but that record bore the catalog number of SKA002. SKA001, the eponymous debut from Autechre in their Lego Feet guise, dates to 1991, and while almost nobody actually had the thing, its existence was known, or at least rumored, by the mid-'90s.) Apparently, <i>Hi Scores</i> has been remastered from the original DATs, and while the digital promo doesn't sound much (if at all) improved from the previous digital version, it's possible that the new edition of the vinyl will sound better than the original wax. But even that hardly matters much, given that this will be the first chance for many of the duo's fans to get their hands on the 12-inch at all. And while it might have been nice to be treated to some previously unreleased material—supposedly, there's still a trove of unreleased Boards music moldering on old cassette tapes—perhaps it's enough to have the original <i>Hi Scores</i> in all its crisp, concise glory. While it wasn't their first record, it's basically the spark that would ignite their reputation—the ember that would go on to fuel the whole glorious campfire headphase. Long may it smolder.</p></div>"|19832.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19832-boards-of-canada-hi-scores-ep/|8.7|Philip Sherburne

The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29847-cut-hands/"">Cut Hands</a> project started when Bennett was asked to DJ at Glasgow club <a href=""http://www.optimo.co.uk/home/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Optimo</a>, where he delivered a set of Haitian Vodou music and heavily percussive African tracks (at ear-splitting volume, natch) and was delighted at the effect it had on the audience. It’s a feeling that still lingers—this is the third album under the Cut Hands name following a series of quick fire releases, some of which have appeared, like this one, on Kiran Sande’s London-based label <a href=""http://blackesteverblack.bigcartel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blackest Ever Black</a>.</p>
<p>It’s been a strange time for Bennett, who has gained a marginally higher profile via the less challenging nature of Cut Hands, but has concurrently had to fend off misinterpretations of his past work. In 2013, he was even moved to make a <a href=""http://williambennett.blogspot.de/2013/03/statement.html?spref=fb"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">statement</a> that clearly outlined his personal beliefs. His take on cultural appropriation, and whether he’s practicing it in Cut Hands, is as forthright as you’d expect. In a 2011 <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2011/10/18/william-bennett-cut-hands-has-the-solution/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with Sande, Bennett claimed that parsing out “world music” as a separate form was a “condescending and patronising” practice that was antithetical to the way he sees music.</p>
<p>All this adds up to a different form of confrontation to the one he practiced in Whitehouse; despite the “it’s-all-just-music” claims, it’s hard to imagine that Bennett wasn’t expecting a few pointed questions thrown his way regarding his intentions for Cut Hands. Where that’s taken him on <i>Festival of the Dead</i> is into a curious cul de sac, where he builds on what came before in tiny increments. It’s placid at times, even skirting around ambient when he rolls out the solitary tones of tracks such as “Belladonna Theme”, “Inlightenment”, and “Fruit Is Ripe”, which intermittently provide respite from the drill-like percussion elsewhere.</p>
<p>Of the meatier material it’s in “The Claw” that Bennett finds most purpose, where his signature hollowed-out drum sound is entwined with niggling percussive elements and a bass heavy groove. It’s a formula he returns to often, with varying results. The former single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16368-damballah-58/"">“Damballah 58”</a> is among the better examples, especially when it’s galvanized by a sample resembling a ticking time bomb. Further tracks torn from a similar blueprint—“Vaudou Take Me High”, “Madwoman (Festival Mix)”, “Fire Ends the Day”—labor the point to the verge of redundancy, especially as there’s a weight of similarly minded Cut Hands material already out there.</p>
<p>Where <i>Festival of the Dead</i> works is by leaving markers that could potentially be followed and exploited at a later date. “None of Your Bones Are Broken” is one of the best tracks Bennett has recorded under this name; constructed from manic, jungle-like backing that intersects with jarring string samples, its a perfectly unharmonious meeting point of inter-continental ideas. Elsewhere there are hints of UK garage in the rhythms Bennett lends to his work, but the overall feel is of a markedly barren place. It's like Bennett looked at clubland and saw an emptiness eating away at it from the inside—an interesting and possibly valid viewpoint, but not one that needs repeating <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p></div>"|19898.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19898-cut-hands-festival-of-the-dead/|6.5|Nick Neyland

The Stockholm producer's surname originally appeared as the main artist on late-2006 single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7692-the-top-500-tracks-of-the-2000s-50-21/"" target=""_blank"">""With Every Heartbeat""</a>, a string-draped beat ballad that went on to become a UK No. 1 for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/"" target=""_blank"">Robyn</a>. His 2008 album, simply titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11581-kleerup/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kleerup</i></a>, gave an early glimpse of now-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"" target=""_blank"">U2</a>-collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5734-lykke-li/"" target=""_blank"">Lykke Li</a> broadening the coy range of her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11414-youth-novels/"" target=""_blank"">debut album</a> earlier that year. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11116-neneh-cherry/"" target=""_blank"">Neneh Cherry</a>? The Swedish-born pop innovator made herself at home on Kleerup's debut, too. Throw in connections to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/810-the-concretes/"" target=""_blank"">the Concretes</a> (whose Lisa Millberg guests on <i>Kleerup</i>) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5358-the-tough-alliance/"" target=""_blank"">the Tough Alliance</a> (his group the Meat Boys remixed 2004's ""Holiday"") and this erstwhile drummer is six degrees from just about any Swede you'd care to name. Going beyond Scandinavia for a second: Did I mention he did a remix for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27895-lady-gaga/"" target=""_blank"">Lady Gaga</a>?</p>
<p>Kleerup's first major release since his self-titled debut went international in 2009 shows he still has fine taste in friends, but it's a bit like being introduced to perfectly nice people at a party where the host isn't able or willing to help explain what you have in common. <i>As If We Never Won</i>, the first of two mini-albums Kleerup plans to release in the next couple of years, once again fixes undeniably talented Swedish vocalists to unabashedly warm-blooded synth-pop. This time, though, the combination just doesn't result in songs as fresh and appealing as ""With Every Heartbeat"" or Lykke Li team-up ""Until It Bleeds""; Kleerup doesn't turn out to be endlessly adaptable to the artists he's with, after all. The result is a pleasant yet also mildly puzzling stopgap that fails either to show newcomers what all the original fuss was about or longtime fans why a proper follow-up has taken so long.</p>
<p>Despite the long gap since <i>Kleerup</i>, that album's '80s-immersed spaciousness has remained a common characteristic in more recent pop. So it's not that Kleerup sounds behind the times when he delves into operatic Euro disco with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3611-royksopp/"" target=""_blank"">Röyksopp</a> vocalist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30750-susanne-sundfr/"" target=""_blank"">Susanne Sundfør</a> on ""Let Me In""—though the song's video, which mainly focuses on Kleerup and his gear, through occasional colored effects, may speak to where his aesthetic is at these days. He broadens his palette a bit, too: ""Rock U"", a smoky collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29643-niki-and-the-dove/"" target=""_blank"">Niki and the Dove</a>'s Malin Dahlstrom, winds up somewhere between the new <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23583-stevie-nicks/"" target=""_blank"">Stevie Nicks</a> album and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30791-haim/"" target=""_blank"">Haim</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53209-listen-giorgio-moroder-remixes-haims-forever/"" target=""_blank"">""Forever (Giorgio Moroder (Remix)""</a>. And an appearance by constantly underrated former First Floor Power singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8600-jenny-wilson/"" target=""_blank"">Jenny Wilson</a> is always welcome, arriving here in the cryptic, mournful pulse of ""To Die For"". </p>
<p>Still, it's hard to shake the sense these all would have been lesser cuts on the debut album, and nothing here lifts the full record out of its malaise. Opening instrumental ""Sad Boys"", another one in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"" target=""_blank"">Moroder</a>-<a href=""http://www.cerrone.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cerrone</a> tradition, works as a continuation of <i>Kleerup</i>-closing ""I Just Want to Make That Sad Boy Smile"" (sorry, anyone reading this hoping for a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32505-yung-lean/"" target=""_blank"">Yung Lean</a> tie-in). Kleerup's serviceable coo fails to catch a spark in the title track's vocoder-brooding duet with the Sounds' Maja Ivarsson, as the two exchange generic phrases (""I'll never let you down / I'll keep on breaking down/ Signed, sealed, whatever""). Most perplexing of all is the finale, ""Thank God for Sending Demons"", a hoarse-voiced acoustic dirge that shares its title with a 2011 song by another Kleerup band, Me and My Army, but isn't a recognizable cover. At some point along the six degrees of separation, a true sense of connection has been lost.</p>
<p>Kleerup was, however, wise to use the mini-album format. The setting has recently been good to artists from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19465-the-knife-shaken-up-versions/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19358-royksopp-robyn-do-it-again/"" target=""_blank"">Röyksopp / Robyn</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18623-best-coast-fade-away/"" target=""_blank"">Best Coast</a>, and it's a reasonable length for a Kleerup release in an era when there's no need to fill out an entire CD (my CD version of the first album isn't even that old, yet my computer can't play it anymore—MP3s prevail!). But the lack of time to get lost in a record's particular world makes it all the more important to have songs that resonate in their own right. Kleerup has been busier than you might've thought since 2008—along with the folk-leaning Me and My Army, he released a Sweden-only Kleerup full-length, 2012's <i>Aniara—</i>so it's possible he's saving his best stuff for the next mini-album. For now, those interested in hearing the most essential post-<i>Kleerup</i> Kleerup music should probably go back to his production for Robyn on ""In My Eyes"", from 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14917-body-talk/"" target=""_blank""><i>Body Talk</i></a>: ""You put your dancing shoes on, and you do it again.""

Chad Ubovich, the touring guitarist responsible for the huge <a href=""http://youtu.be/r8Hh15CQ9-Q?t=1m35s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">solo on ""See It My Way""</a>, has undeniable chops. He's also the bassist for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31237-fuzz/"">Fuzz</a>, and it's the same deal—he does <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnS5WRKGmx4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a lot more</a> than just slouch in the background and play the minimum. When this dude takes a solo, you watch. Based on those sideman gigs alone, it makes sense that his band <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Meatbodies"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Meatbodies</a> got picked up by <a href=""http://intheredrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">In the Red</a> for a pair of singles and a long-player.</p>
<p>Last year, they released a very good self-titled cassette on Ty Segall's <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/products?filter_label=GOD"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">God? Records</a> (as Chad and the Meatbodies). It sold out fairly quickly and, in circles that care about those sorts of things, became one of those instantaneous small batch collector's items. But with their debut LP, it's more difficult to view the band as small-press ass-kicking upstarts. <i>Meatbodies</i> was recorded and mixed by <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/1147183-Eric-Bauer"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eric ""King Riff"" Bauer</a>, <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/2078769-Bob-Marshall-3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bob Marshall</a>, and <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/377956-Chris-Woodhouse"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chris Woodhouse</a> (who, between the three of them, have worked on every <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/402-shake-appeal-castle-faces-live-in-san-francisco-series/""><i>Live in San Francisco</i></a> release and most Segall, Cronin, Fuzz, and Oh Sees records). The cover art was done by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18570-fuzz-fuzz/""><i>Fuzz</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16744-slaughterhouse/""><i>Slaughterhouse</i></a> artist <a href=""http://www.tatianakartomten.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tatiana Kartomten</a>. Segall even plays drums and bass on a few tracks here. Meatbodies are embedded in that world, and they're working within a formula that's proved successful for their more-visible peers. Comparisons are inevitable; the bar is high.</p>
<p>Pro wrestling heels use the term ""B+ player"" about guys in Ubovich's position—rookies who put on a good show but aren't quite headliners. But he <i>rips</i>, you see. He's always been a destroyer, and on <i>Meatbodies</i>, he also proves to be an ace rock'n'roll strategist. The tone here is set perfectly: 59 seconds of psychedelic sci-fi noise, and then, very suddenly, Ubovich and Segall come in at full power, electric guitars unrelenting, with ""Disorder"". It's a loud, exciting, kinetic, and brazen introduction. Like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeJmj6yEonE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=30s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Daniel Bryan before him</a>, Ubovich rises to the occasion.</p>
<p>But Meatbodies don't just blindly hit peak after peak, shredding toward the high heavens uninterrupted for a full album. They pull back and indulge their more psychedelic inclinations, letting Ubovich's voice shine, lilt, and echo over steady acoustic strumming. When that starts sounding too sterile after a couple minutes, he dirties it up by dropping an electric guitar solo in the middle. While they craft plenty of catchy hooks and choruses over the album's dozen tracks, they don't lean on any one thing for long. There's always a changeup in place. They'll dismantle a loud and fast song for a sluggish, slow finish. Any band can churn out an exciting two-minute garage punk song and then repeat the formula a few times. Very few artists of this ilk exhibit this much patience, which makes for a continually rewarding listen.</p>
<p>If there's a clear-cut example of Meatbodies making the upgrade from ""band with a tape and some 7"" tracks"" to ""rock band to watch,"" it's the re-recorded album version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16921-meatbodies-wahoo/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">""Wahoo""</a>. The ramshackle stomper is now stadium-ready. (It's worth checking out the original <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dTU-OGk3qM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tape version of that song</a>, too—a fun document of the band's lo-fi, warbly beginnings.) The track comes late in the album, and when it arrives, Ubovich has already found several opportunities earlier in the LP to show off what he's capable of as a guitarist. And sure, there's excellent guitar work on the track, but there's a clearer focus on the confidence he exhibits as a frontman. He yelps, screams, and croons like a seasoned rock star. ""I don't know and I don't care,"" he sings at the bridge. He <i>does</i> care, though—if he didn't, <i>Meatbodies</i> wouldn't sound half this good.</p></div>"|19701.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19701-meatbodies-meatbodies/|7.5|Evan Minsker

Following the release of 2013’s critical success <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17552-we-are-the-21st-century-ambassadors-of-peace-magic/""><i>We Are the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Ambassadors of Peace &amp; Magic</i></a>, Foxygen seemed to pack a career’s worth of triumphs and travesties into a single album cycle—and, as such,<br/> <i>…And Star Power</i> translates all the exhilaration and exhaustion the band has experienced over the past two years into an unwieldy, 24-song splatter that often sounds like a band at war with itself. It’s as if Foxygen is issuing a challenge to all the rubberneckers in the audience by saying, “You think we’re a trainwreck? You ain’t seen nothing yet.”</p>
<p>Coming from a band that has chalked up its many <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50119-foxygen-cancel-european-tour-and-festival-dates/"">concert cancellations</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/49930-sxsw-foxygen-go-off-the-rails/"">onstage meltdowns</a> to tour-induced fatigue, <i>…And Star Power</i> aptly approximates the dislocating sensation of strung-out, sleepless nights in posh hotel rooms that have had the Do Not Disturb sign dangling on the outer-door handle for several days, with moments of lucid (if bleary eyed) introspection regularly giving way to flashes of fever-dream psychosis. The raucous opening warm-up exercise is titled “Star Power Airlines”, a nostalgic nod to that bygone era when <a href=""http://www.feelnumb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/led-zeppelin-airplane.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rock bands could become popular enough to acquire their own jet fleets</a>, but also a telling indicator of the many random recording locations—from the Chateau Marmont in L.A. to The Magic Shop in New York—that lend this album a whirlwind tour itinerary of its own.</p>
<p>Despite its double-album girth, <i>…And Star Power</i> feels less like a ’70s-rock masterwork than a ’90s indie patchwork in the tradition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9591-wowee-zowee-sordid-sentinels-edition/"">Pavement’s <i>Wowee Zowee</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7053-iii/"">Sebadoh's <i>III</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30619-the-olivia-tremor-control/"">the Olivia Tremor Control</a>’s <i>Dusk at Cubist Castle</i>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4567-ween/"">Ween</a>’s earliest brown-outs. This is an album you get lost inside—you don’t so much listen to its four-sided sprawl as free-fall into its increasingly deranged depths. Its kitchen-sink messthetic (parts of which were rendered in Rado’s actual kitchen) encompasses pristine power pop, stoner country-rock, a four-part title-track suite (overture included) that introduces the band’s punk-alter-ego-cum-pirate-radio-station Star Power, space-age bachelor-pad synth doodles, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"">Lou Reed</a>-copping junkie poetry, acid-folk rambles reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/298-syd-barrett/"">Syd Barrett</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5948-the-feelies/"">Feelies</a>-esque jabber-jangle; and a song that sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"">Suicide</a> crashing a Frankie Avalon/Annette Funicello beach party. And that’s all before we’ve even reached Side Three (the one accurately subtitled “Scream: A Journey Through Hell”).</p>
<p>In its most fully realized moments, <i>…And Star Power</i> is the album Todd Rundgren could’ve released between <i>Something/Anything?</i> and <i>A Wizard, a True Star</i>, its best songs striking an uncanny balance between the exquisite balladry of the former and the progged-out fantasias of the latter. True, the Runt referentialism is beyond blatant: lead single “How Can You Really” is a perfect mirror reflection of “I Saw the Light”, while “Star Power IV: Ooh Ooh” distills the candlelit intimacy of “It Wouldn’t Have Made Any Difference” into a quick post-coital cuddle. (The press release for <i>…And Star Power</i> actually summarizes the album’s ethos—“rock and roll for the skull""—by quoting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3842-patti-smith"">Patti Smith</a>’s original <i>Creem</i> magazine review of <i>A Wizard, a True Star</i>. Even this band’s self-aggrandizement comes second-hand.)</p>
<p>But for all their shameless appropriation, Foxygen have become increasingly assured and accomplished songwriters, outfitting standouts like “Coulda Been My Love” (the ironically serene source of the intra-band acrimony mentioned at the top of this review), “Cannibal Holocaust”, and “Everyone Needs Love” not just with silken soft-focus melodies and heavenly harmonies, but ever-evolving arrangements that steer the songs into surprising, splendorous new directions without losing the throughline. At their best, a Foxygen song is like that drunk who seems destined to topple over, only to <a href=""http://youtu.be/dKHrBr8mY78?t=1m28s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">turn their stumble into a perfect pirouette</a>.</p>
<p>If <i>We Are the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Ambassadors of Peace &amp; Magic</i> completed Foxygen’s long-gestating evolution from private recording project to proper band, …<i>And Star Power</i> expands their universe to even greater degree, placing them at the epicenter of a modern psych-rock constellation that includes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"">the Flaming Lips</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3139-of-montreal/"">Of Montreal</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28957-white-fence/"">White Fence</a>, and L.A. fuzz-popsters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29757-bleached/"">Bleached</a>, all of whom make guest appearances here. (And, as if to acknowledge their place on the storied madcap continuum, they give shout-outs to Skip Spence and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12882-kim-fowley"">Kim Fowley</a> in the liners.) At certain points, Foxygen’s generosity of spirit goes beyond merely accommodating a cameo to outright handing over the reins of their album to third parties: the brass-knuckled “Star Power III: What Are We Good For” begins with a Kevin Barnes dispatch live from the corner of Lexington and 125, and Foxygen even admit in the liners they’re entirely not sure what he’s yapping about. The Lips’ Steven Drozd is credited with composing the analog-synth strut “Mattress Warehouse”, while the adrenalizing freakbeat rave-up “Brooklyn Police Station” features White Fence’s Tim Presley in so many different capacities (bass, guitar, harmonies), it’s no surprise the song ends up sounding like it was plucked outright from one of his albums.</p>
<p>Tellingly, the self-produced <i>…And Star Power</i> is Foxygen’s first Jagjaguwar release made without their mentor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4137-richard-swift/"">Richard Swift</a> behind the boards, and while the album shows France and Rado can no doubt craft classic-rock-radio-caliber songs without his compositional expertise, their reactionary attempts at punky aggression and noise experimentation come off as half-baked. Particularly in the album’s back half, it starts to feel like Foxygen decided to make <br/><i>…And Star Power</i> a double album before writing the necessary number of songs to justify one, stuffing the gaps with frivolous filler that wouldn’t be able stand on its own outside of the record’s crazy-quilt framework. And so the lo-fi doom-metal-drone-cum-garage-skronk of “Cold Winter/Freedom” (the wrought-iron gateway into the aforementioned “Scream” side) rambles on for six tuneless minutes, while counterpart track “Freedom II” and “Talk” drive their <i>Nuggets</i>-schooled grooves into the ground through incessant, nonsensical hollering and abrupt structural shifts that don’t so much yield a dramatic effect as betray their lack of direction. Such regressions may be intended to serve as the freaked-out flipside to <i>…And Star Power</i>’s more meditative material, but Foxygen’s “Journey Through Hell” ultimately sounds less like therapeutic catharsis than aimless dicking around for yuks in the practice space. </p>
<p>But for Foxygen, such violent pendulum swings prove to be the musical manifestation of an<br/>eccentric spirit they once conveyed lyrically. What ultimately elevated <i>We Are the 21<sup>st</sup> Century</i> beyond mere classic-rock karaoke was France’s playfully wry observations, which infused Foxygen’s retro affinities with a distinctly modern-day sensibility and irreverence. <i>…And Star Power</i>, however, works the other way: the anarchic sound world is grounded by more sobering songwriting, with France’s once-prominent voice left to float in the psychedelic soup—which means you won’t find any instantly quotable zingers here on par with “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/14745-no-destruction/"">No Destruction</a>”. But while France’s words may be more nondescript this time out, the band’s tumultuous recent history suggests platitudes like “You’ve got to hang on”, “How am I going to make it with you?”, and “Where must we go again to become friends?” are genuine, necessary pleas for sanity and serenity.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the impenetrable “Cold Winter/Freedom” is preceded by an endearing little snippet of an eight-year-old France’s earliest recording forays, wherein he acts as the on-air announcer for his own imaginary radio station. “Hold onto your butts and get ready!” little Sam declares, and, in essence, …<i>And Star Power</i> is Foxygen’s attempt to recapture that sort of innocence and wide-eyed enthusiasm after a prolonged, public struggle to keep their shit together. But the retroactive warning is nonetheless appreciated: <i>…And Star Power</i> is a long, bumpy ride back to where Foxygen once belonged, and, at times, your butt is bound to feel sore.</p></div>"|19769.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19769-foxygen-and-star-power/|7.0|Stuart Berman

Fortunately, by 2012’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16975-the-north/"">The North</a></i>, Stars decided to have fun again (or for the first time) and <i>No One Is Lost</i> finds them chasing base thrills with more even more gusto. But in micromanaging every celebratory aspect, it raises the question of whether a party is still a party if Stars run through it.</p>
<p>As opposed to its nostalgic predecessor, <i>No One Is Lost</i> concerns itself with forward momentum, beginning with its serendipitous recording atop the Royal Phoenix, a now-shuttered Montreal gay disco. While the Phoenix was still in business, the bass would make its way up to Stars' studio and they were motivated to “out-throb the throb.” And some of <i>No One Is Lost</i> qualifies as danceable, if not exactly “dance music.” It’s simply a more extroverted look at the artisanal indie genres that one has come to expect from this band—melodramatic, Smiths-derived jangle, sophistipop, blue-eyed Motown—though they strew triplet bass drum across the straight soul-clap of “A Stranger” like they might’ve heard <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31089-dj-rashad"">DJ Rashad</a> at some point.  </p>
<p>More to the point, the narrators of <i>No One Is Lost</i> abide by a fatalism that’s the closest thing we’ll probably get to actual optimism on a Stars record: something along the lines of, you’ll probably have to spend most of your days in a shit job or a boring relationship, so make the night count. That’s the message of six-minute mission statement “From the Night”, and as far as Canadian indie collectives paying homage to the transformative powers of sundown by fusing arena rock and Gloria Estefan, well...it’s at least in the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fFAKrIntzY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">top two</a> from the past year. But even if Stars can never truly cut loose, they can offer the crowd an honest hands-up chorus and lack the earnestness that made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire"">Arcade Fire</a>’s costume parties sound stiff.</p>
<p>But as the album progresses, that becomes a liability. If not earnestness, you wish Stars could demonstrate the same kind of black-and-white, life-or-death stakes in their music as their Montreal neighbors. If you’re gonna espouse a “live fast, die young” philosophy, you have to sound like you believe it too. This is less of a problem when Stars engage in their usual, theatrical songwriting constructs and set pieces. The he-said, she-said between Torquil Campbell and Amy Millan is too comfy to generate much friction at this point, although the possible songwriting-as-lovemaking metaphor of “You Keep Coming Up” (""You gotta give it away/ So you can get it for free"") does at least provide wincing awkwardness.</p>
<p>But when <i>No One Is Lost</i> tries to blend in with the youth, Stars sound like professors rather than participants. The schoolyard shouts of “Turn It Up” sound out of character in all aspects, though at least the title refers to the radio and not the 2013 colloquialism. And while “Trap Door” contains the most elegant choral melody, Campbell’s critiques of hedonism’s inherent hollowness come off as smug, sounding like someone who’s writing about the <i>idea</i> of it rather than the experience—“the kids in VIP are all looking for a family/ Their teeth are made of gold but their wallets are empty.” <i>Gold teeth? </i>Does Campbell still think <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXDoxxlgNG0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">people party like it's 1999</a>?</p>
<p>That's a more egregious example of how Stars' lyrics are pithy, but facile, lacking any kind of edge. The most problematic one comes when Stars deliver what should be the mic-drop, valedictory address during the title track: “Put your hands up because everybody dies.” It reminds you that irony pervades this album from its title on down and that Campbell feels the best way to cope with the pervasive disorientation of being alive is, “To get arseholed and listen to Dionne Warwick,” another arch quote demonstrating how “fuck it” is so carefully curated here. Is <i>No One Is Lost </i>even an album meant to be listened to in the very situations it writes about? While a fine enough record in its own right, it’s more suited to fostering a discussion about the theoretical implications of our collective, impending doom than celebrating it.</p></div>"|19924.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19924-stars-no-one-is-lost/|5.8|Ian Cohen

For the New Brunswick duo, Dads is their <i>life</i> if not necessarily a living—to juxtapose the tremendous emotional investment and inherent triviality of such a lot, Bradley asks, “If I can’t even afford a grave for myself/ Then why am I so afraid of dying alone?”</p>
<p>As with most in their situation, Dads justify things by placing a lot of importance on the actions of those closest to them and their interactions with these people, i.e. “the scene.” This is a commonplace concern in punk rock, so it’s notable that Bradley wants to be “happy,” not “true” or “real,” since he finds the people who take it upon themselves to set those standards are often the most full of shit; or, as it’s memorably put later on during “You Hold Back”, “You can’t go against the grain with no natural wood.” This is a commonplace observation as well, but while most bands dealing in this subject matter assume the moral high ground, Bradley’s willing to acknowledge that he’s part of the problem and he’s going to take his brain and his issues with him wherever he goes. It’s just strange that he accuses himself of holding back here, because Dads put it all out there on this gut-spilling, bold and progressive album.</p>
<p>It’s a record of transitions in all aspects. Dads’ trajectory is obvious even before you hear a note of their music; compare the cover and album title from their 2012 effort <a href=""http://dadsnj.bandcamp.com/album/american-radass-this-is-important"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>American Radass (This is Important)</i></a> to the wistful shot that graces last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15818-dads-boat-rich/""><i>Pretty Good</i></a> EP and the stylish, muted artwork of <i>I’ll Be the Tornado</i>. Like their most accomplished peers, Dads are synthesists, honoring their influences without rehashing them and making an unspoken argument that late-'90s emo was never meant to be quarantined outside of “proper” punk or indie rock. Since they’re a duo, guitarist Scott Scharinger handles lead, rhythm, and bass for Dads, supplying fluid, melodic passages that can stand on their own as evocative instrumentals, a la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2777-mineral/"">Mineral</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/76-american-football"">American Football</a>. But Dads also account for the crowd-pleasing urgency of chunky power chords, cathartic, singalong choruses (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17076-dads-chewing-ghosts/"">“Chewing Ghosts”</a>), call-and-response hooks (“You Hold Back”) and jangly college rock (“Take Back Today”).  Bradley’s vocals pierce through a clean and clear mix, while his drumming boasts a fast-twitch athleticism that unified <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3406-the-promise-ring"">the Promise Ring</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/450-braid"">Braid</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse"">Modest Mouse</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2461-les-savy-fav/"">Les Savy Fav</a> as an alternative from the slacker affectations and slapdash musicianship that defined indie rock a few years prior.</p>
<p>But more importantly, the pains of Dads’ personal evolution are detailed extensively in the lyrics, and <i>I’ll Be the Tornado</i> inherits the annual <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6788-the-execution-of-all-things"">The </a></i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6788-the-execution-of-all-things""><i>Execution of All Things </i></a>Achievement Award from last year’s winner, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31022-waxahatchee"">Waxahatchee</a>; in other words, it’s the album where the main goal, if not sole purpose, would appear to be providing the greatest number of potential LiveJournal/MySpace/Twitter status updates.  Bradley’s lyrics aren’t poetry, and they’re not intellectual or referential, but they are almost entirely composed of a clever variation of things you might find yourself saying in any real life situation. There’s just as much drama as there is sitcom material; when Bradley wants to be a part of a lover’s inside jokes on “But”, it’s sweet, but during the tense acoustic first half of opener “Grand Edge, MI”, he moans, “I wanna tell you about my past...I wanna tell you about everything,” and the sentiment is somewhat threatening. You sense he’s someone with an insatiable urge to disclose his most intimate secrets and the knowledge that it always results in driving people away; but maybe not <i>this time</i>.</p>
<p>Taken in concert, lines like those create an ambivalence that gives the listener a sense of real stakes and humanity in <i>I’ll Be the Tornado</i>; you’re never certain whether Bradley’s confessing to being the good guy or a dick in any situation. During “Take Back Today”, he confides, “I wish you could’ve been there to have met my father/ When he wasn’t always in pain and some doctor’s new project.” But these moments are put up against the real pleasures associated with being an up-and-coming band (“I remember cities in sunsets that I never lived in/ But goddamn, those days/ We were living it”) that are nonetheless fleeting and always leading to the next high<span>: </span>“I made my life into a competition/ Where’s my trophy mantle/ You sent clippings to an article I couldn’t begin to handle.”  </p>
<p>The resultant distance from security and trust makes Bradley’s heart grow fond<span>—</span>both “But” and “Fake Knees” slowly evolve to harmonized crescendos and hard lessons about embracing the imperfections in yourself and others. On “Fake Knees”, a partner’s coffee breath and substance issues rattle around Bradley’s head, little annoyances about to metastasize into dealbreakers, before he remembers the warmth of sleeping together in tattered T-shirts and the bigger picture comes into focus<span>—</span>“I’m on a redeye crying over some fucking clothes”. But there are just as many cold, hard truths about how some people just need to be cut out entirely. “Chewing Ghosts” turns the other cheek and it still comes across like a slap in the face anyway. Prior to the rousing affirmation of the chorus, Bradley spits, “Enemies come and enemies go/ Some burn dull enough just to fade away.” Not coincidentally, “enemies” and “memories” rhyme in the same way ""punk"" and ""drunk"" do earlier in “Chewing Ghosts”; they’re not exactly synonymous, but in Dads’ experience, those concepts are inextricable.</p>
<p>Even if the echoing post-rock of the seven-minute “Only You” makes it a bit too on-the-nose as an ""epic closer,"" it serves as a proper way to decompress; leading up to that point, Bradley finds himself obsessing over the past (“I won’t bury my dead/ I just trample the bodies”) and, “Spending so much time in the future, I forgot about the present.” That last line comes in a song called “Take Back Today”, the title of which is the only thing that comes across as a piece of advice rather than one man relating his experience and hoping you understand. But you don’t have to be an artist to grasp how the pursuit of sobriety, companionship and serenity can be at odds with a career or lifestyle that gives you every opportunity to go back to the old, familiar and comforting misery. You’re only required to be a human being, and <i>I’ll Be the Tornado</i> is as accomplished and confident as a band can sound while sorting their shit out in public.</p></div>"|19851.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19851-dads-ill-be-the-tornado/|7.5|Ian Cohen

The implicit message was that, at a show (particularly those held in the sort of ad-hoc, stage-less venues DD/MM/YYYY frequented) what matters is not so much the name of who’s playing as the commitment and intensity they put into the performance, which should in turn forever burn a memory of a specific time and place into the lucky attendee’s blown mind. And while the music Absolutely Free creates is dramatically different than that of their former incarnation, the underlying principle remains: It’s a band’s ultimate obligation to make their audience feel like they’re part of something special.</p>
<p>Since forming in late 2011 just as DD/MM/YYYY announced its break-up, Absolutely Free have confined their recorded output to a series of limited-run 12-inch releases (issued via <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5160-fucked-up/"">Fucked Up</a> guitarist Mike Haliechuk’s One Big Silence imprint) that have packed several album’s worth of ideas into prog-pop mini-suites. And their live performances to date have mostly steered clear of the traditional club circuit in favor of all-out happenings: the band celebrated their debut single “UFO” by leading audiences Pied Piper-style between nearby venues in Toronto’s Kensington Market neighbourhood, performing a live soundtrack to <i>The Day the Earth Stood Still</i> and a set of their own material before throwing a video dance party modeled after <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2qpIBTbE8c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1990s-era MuchMusic-hosted high-school shindigs</a>. And while the decision to release follow-up single “On the Beach” last October may have negated any opportunities for a fun-in-the-sun soiree, Absolutely Free did the next best thing: perform a concert <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08uiEXWHcVs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">during a night-swim session at a local indoor swimming pool</a>.</p>
<p>D. Boon once cheekily described <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6048-minutemen/"">the Minutemen</a>’s herky-jerky poli-punk as “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZvsAh5VFRw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">scientist rock</a>,” but Absolutely Free genuinely look and sound like the sort of band concocted in some sort of after-school lab experiment. Their stage set-up resembles a madcap workshop of effects pedals, deconstructed drum kits, melodicas, buzzing analog synths, and the sort of dense entanglement of wires that makes you worry someone’s going to get electrocuted. But the band’s self-titled debut full-length (produced by Haliechuk) bears the fully realized fruits of Absolutely Free’s endless experimentation, yielding a compact 8-song, 42-minute album that retains the band’s sense of intrepidity while travelling a more linear course. </p>
<p>Where the group’s early singles favored extended ambient intros, impulsive structural shifts, and blown-out finales, the songs on <i>Absolutely Free</i> tend to patiently linger on a single idea and see how it naturally evolves. Singing drummer Matt King’s vocals are also less of a driving force here; rather than lead the charge, he seems more willing to let his existential ruminations reverberate out into the cosmos. But while the band have reined in some of the volatility that made those introductory singles so exhilarating, there’s a cool consistency and newfound accessibility to <i>Absolutely Free</i> that makes it an easy, enchanting front-to-back listen, the songs locking together to form a smoothly contoured album arc. Even the most chaotic elements—like the spinning-radio-dial dissonance woven through the opening reverie “Window of Time”—eventually fuse into the album’s steady wavelength. That’s not to suggest Absolutely Free aren’t still shooting for the moon; they’ve simply activated the cruise control so that they can better savor the trip and enjoy the view.</p>
<p>These are the sort of songs that oh-so subtly build a snowball into an icy boulder: the sleigh-belled, drum-thumping pop of “Beneath the Air” and “Striped Light” initially suggest the sequel to <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10559-andorra/"">Andorra</a></i> that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/"">Caribou </a>never made<i>, </i>before gradually adding layer upon layer of counter-melodies and textural disorder to shatter any ’60s-retro illusions. “Burred Lens” works itself up into a pink-smoked synthphony as engrossing as anything on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17804-the-flaming-lips-the-terror/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Terror</i></a>; “Earth II”—presumably a nod to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tkKSRF1UwY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the 1971 sci-fi flick</a>, not the<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_2_(album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">namesake doom-metal masterpiece</a>—is the sort of deep-space kosmiche-rock odyssey that they’ll be blasting on the Orion in 2025 when cruising for other intelligent life in the universe.</p>
<p>However, the closing eight-minute epic “Spiral Jetty” suggests <i>Absolutely Free</i>’s newly holistic aesthetic is already being subjected to a deconstructive rethink, with a jagged drum beat that cuts through the song’s glass-dome synth sheen and seemingly liberates the band from the more conventional song structures they imposed on themselves for much of the record. After all, DD/MM/YYYY decided to break up the moment they felt their unpredictably spastic, instrument-swapping art-core attack was becoming a routine unto itself; don’t be surprised if the greater focus in effect on <i>Absolutely Free</i> is simply a means for the band to identify the peripheries yet to be explored.  </p></div>"|19770.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19770-absolutely-free-absolutely-free/|7.5|Stuart Berman

But they work outside of their respective comfort zones, transcending geographical boundaries to the point where it’s tricky to know where they’re coming from.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Xylouris is the descendant of Greek music royalty. His uncle is Nikos Xylouris, a national icon whose nickname is “archangel of Crete” because his songs are hugely influential and beloved, and his dad is Antonis Xylouris, a.k.a. Psarandonis, a singer and lyra player who is well-regarded for pushing traditional folk music in new directions. George spent much of his childhood playing the lute and joining his father on his recordings and in concert; by using the lute as a lead instrument, George, too, challenges musical expectations. </p>
<p class=""p1"">White’s background, on the other hand, is decidedly post-punk; he co-founded the Dirty Three with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1332-warren-ellis/"">Warren Ellis</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4311-mick-turner/"">Mick Turner</a> in the early-'90s and went on to collaborate with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"">Will Oldham</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"">PJ Harvey</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/710-nick-cave/"">Nick Cave</a>, and many more. He's a magnificent, multi-faceted, and sensitive drummer with the perfect mix of ferocity and finesse. </p>
<p class=""p1"">In Xylouris White, the lute/drums configuration makes maps irrelevant, at various points recalling Indian, Eastern European, African, Middle Eastern, Western, and Mediterranean modes. There is jazz and punk here along with dashes of bluegrass, klezmer, and folk and yet it’s all conveyed seamlessly. At some points, Xylouris’ approach to the lute recalls prepared guitar or fingerstyle practitioners like Glenn Jones, himself a friend, follower, and collaborator of John Fahey. The searching and surprise of such exploration shines through in “Suburb”, a virtuoso performance, the lute bouncing back and forth between harmonic patterns and sturdy strumming, simultaneously meshing with found and traditional percussion accents. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Within the sequence of the record, “Psarandonis Syrto” is sure-footed after <i>Goats </i>presents Xylouris White spending a couple of songs getting a feel for one another. Syrtos are traditional Greek dances that people bust out at parties and weddings but “Psarandonis Syrto” has a somber, contemplative tone. On “Pulling the Bricks”, each musical flourish is a gambit and a dare, Xylouris leaning into his lute for a stretch of fast tremolo picking, while White, supportive yet minimal, provides an up tempo pattern on a ride cymbal.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It’s one of many instances on this record where pieces sound festive but brooding. “Old School Sousta” seems to be a sly piss-take at the Crete folk traditionalism that Xylouris employs in his busy, insistent lute lick and that White bolsters, mostly rolling tom drum thuds before the song climaxes with an off-kilter martial snare, signifying a parade happily running its course. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Xylouris and White are both capable of starting storms. When, in their respective work, they strike upon a moment where they wish to explode, the jolt can be a remarkable feat of musical strength. Knowing this lends an eerie suspense to things like “Wind”, which features some dense and dynamic interaction between the players but the builds are subtle. As the piece rumbles forth, there are many instances where it feels like something huge is about to happen but the song teases and dissipates. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The pensive joy within <i>Goats </i>stems from two musicians of seemingly disparate backgrounds, communicating together with the tools they know best and as well as anyone else who has ever used them. Here though, with new partners and parameters, they’ve struck upon something challenging, wholly inventive, and rewarding. </p></div>"|19903.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19903-xylouris-white-goats/|7.4|Vish Khanna

The only real evidence of the band’s existence was an early mix of the song “Hot and Cold”, which Timony posted online, then quickly removed. Within a month, the band–which also includes bassist/singer Betsy Wright (Childballads) and drummer Laura Harris (Aquarium, Benjy Ferree)—had joined up with Merge. By spring, “Hot and Cold” had been remixed and released on a three-song single.</p>
<p>And now, only a year in comes <i>Rips</i>, Ex Hex’s debut full-length. It’s the record of the summer, albeit one that's arrived two months too late—a collection of perfectly lean power-pop tunes that evoke <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9474-tom-petty/"">Tom Petty</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27645-the-runaways/"">the Runaways </a>while conjuring the unruly energy of contemporary mid-fi bashers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"">Thee Oh Sees</a>. <i>Rips</i> sounds fine on headphones or at home, but it’s best enjoyed in the car where it’s possible to feel more perfectly tuned into the music’s steady velocity. The production is clean, but not polished, and the performances are tight. It doesn't sound like a record that was made in a hurry.</p>
<p>An active musician since the early ’90s—first in Autoclave, then in Helium, and then as a solo artist—Timony hasn’t gotten her due in the last decade and change. After two solo records—<i>Ex Hex</i> (2005) and <i>The Shapes We Make</i> (2007)—were met with muted reactions, she mostly called it quits on touring, popping up only sporadically in groups like Garland of Hours and Soft Power. In 2010, she joined <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29213-wild-flag/"">Wild Flag</a>, a bi-coastal quartet that featured former Sleater-Kinney members Carrie Brownstein and Janet Weiss, and seemingly caught a second wind. The band released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15798-wild-flag/"">one well-received full length</a> and traveled extensively, but quietly parted ways last fall. Wild Flag was a potentially tough act to follow for Timony, partially because of the band's high visibility, which was given extra charge through the ascendance of Brownstein’s comedy sketch show ""Portlandia"".</p>
<p>So, it’s heartening to find that Ex Hex is, in a lot of ways, a better band. Wild Flag's membership was split between D.C. and Portland and, perhaps unintentionally, the band's songwriting sometimes seemed to ping-pong between different sensibilities. Timony, Harris, and Wright seem more stylistically attuned to one another—after all, they have a closer geographical relationship, which enables them to practice regularly—and Wright's two contributions to <i>Rips</i>, “How You Got That Girl” and “Radio On”, both slot perfectly into the record's uniform, neo-roller rink vibe.</p>
<p>The songs look back to ’70s radio rock with some amount of yearning, but <i>Rips</i> isn’t purely motivated by retromania. There’s a bit of environmental pressure built into this record: garage rock is adaptive music, where minimum resources can yield maximum impact, and it can thrive where rents are pricey and practice space is in short supply. You can write it with the people who are around, it plays well in a basement and also on a stage, and it’s easy to know when it’s working. If you can remember a garage rock song two minutes after it’s over, then it’s probably a good one.</p>
<p>All the genre demands is excitement, and <i>Rips</i> is definitely exciting. It’s stripped down, fast, and physical; the songs mostly revolve around scrubby, disappointing dudes and their failings, but the message is never maudlin or tragic. Timony spent years speak-singing, performing lyrics in a cool and detached tone that wavered in and out of pitch. But in Ex Hex, she’s developed a more overtly melodic delivery. As a guitarist, she’s playing a bit below her chops, but her solos are tasteful and on point, pitching up the emotional heft of a song once words won't cut it anymore.</p>
<p>Over the years, Timony's own musical style evolved into something fairly distinct, a witchy-sounding and modestly mystical music that bred progressive rock and ’70s British folk with elements of D.C. post-punk. Some of that sound exists in Ex Hex, too, particularly in the modest pace of “Hot and Cold”,<i> </i>but <i>Rips</i> mostly finds the band walking away from Timony's established voice and pushing toward something more direct and energetic<i>—</i>embracing the past, but also blowing things up and starting again.</p></div>"|19891.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19891-ex-hex-rips/|8.4|Aaron Leitko

Bunyan’s first record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1135-just-another-diamond-day/""><i>Just Another Diamond Day</i></a>, came out in 1970 and quickly disappeared; later, it was rediscovered, developing a devoted cult among admirers of obscure folk. Following that renewed interest, she dusted off the old Martin and recorded her second album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1136-lookaftering/""><i>Lookaftering</i></a>, in 2005. So that’s three full-lengths in 44 years, which can be looked at in a few different ways. Given the nature of Bunyan’s art, I’m inclined to praise her patience and her willingness to make music only when she feels like has something to say; in the era of the attention economy, choosing <i>not</i> to put work in front of people, to live a life away from the spotlight, can be its own kind of statement. And if things turn out like she says, Bunyan goes out on a high note: <i>Heartleap</i> is a subtle and beautiful album with a simmering intensity, a perfect match of her hushed delivery and sharply observed vignettes that move between memories, dreams, and moments of quiet wonder.</p>
<p><i>Heartleap</i> would be a poetic place to end because, in 2014, Bunyan’s style of music has no particular cultural currency. In the middle of the last decade, when the indie world was enamored with the Incredible String Band and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/313-the-anthology-of-american-folk-music-as-physical-artifact/""><i>The Anthology of American Folk Music</i></a> and acoustic music that was both familiar and strange was in vogue, Bunyan was drafted as a kind of godmother of a small movement. Her initial obscurity obviously added to her aura and <i>Diamond Day</i> became one of those records passed around like a secret; by the time she made the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/192-prospect-hummer-ep/""><i>Prospect Hummer</i></a> EP with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"">Animal Collective</a> in 2005, her place in the landscape was secure, and <i>Lookaftering</i> showed that she was capable of picking up where she left off. But <i>Heartleap</i> has no significant context surrounding it—it’s just a record, one that doesn’t have the burden of making up for lost time. And the facts of its creation—Bunyan wrote and recorded much of it alone, over the course of seven years—underscore the point, making it feel like a low-stakes private dispatch, one destined to reach the people it needs to reach.</p>
<p>No one sounds like Vashti Bunyan, in part because most people would be afraid to. Her voice is defined by its limitations, hovering between singing and whispering, but it’s also an instrument of great expressivity. Because she sings without vibrato in a quavering register, it’s often described as “childlike.” This surely had something to do with her appeal in the mid-2000s freak-folk moment—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/288-devendra-banhart/"">Devendra Banhart</a> and Animal Collective, in particular, forged an aesthetic out of regression, privileging instinct and raw imagination. But Bunyan’s lyrics tell a different story, one of graceful maturity and wisdom.</p>
<p>Bunyan has said in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6175-vashti-bunyan/"">interviews</a> that she was intimidated when she was starting out because she felt she could never measure up to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"">Joni Mitchell</a>, which is fair. But the truth is that Mitchell, for all her genius, could never do what Bunyan does: she crafts miniature worlds, settings where small gestures can be imbued with great meaning. “Mother” offers an image of a girl watching through a crack in the door while her mother, unaware that she’s being observed, dresses and sings softly to herself. It’s the kind of moment that burns into all of our memories, where nothing really “happens” but somehow we remember every detail; these snapshots are where our awareness of the world and our place in it expands, just a little, and few artists capture them as well as Vashti Bunyan.</p>
<p>The act of perception is a recurring theme (“The Boy”), as is the limitation of language (“Gunpowder”), but the overriding subject is the mystery of life itself, how we live and die, what it feels like to be trapped inside of a body, how we balance our need for human connection and our need for solitude. The backdrop for Bunyan’s songs could hardly be simpler and more minimal—bits of guitar and synth, most of which she plays herself—but it’s all beautifully produced and clear, the instruments doing what they need to do to get the songs across and nothing more.</p>
<p>“I do remember what an old friend told me/ He said ‘don’t you go worrying about me, I’m only sad as I want to be’,” she sings in “Holy Smoke”, and it’s a fitting takeaway from this album, and indeed Bunyan’s recorded output as a whole. Her work is a testament to the power of even the quietest music to help us feel things deeply, an experience that lasts for a few minutes that we can return to for a lifetime.</p></div>"|19673.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19673-vashti-bunyan-heartleap/|7.8|Mark Richardson

At first it sounds like a friendly request, but it soon becomes a threat: “The river’s runny bloody, the towers tumbling down,” she sings, not exactly horrified by the tableau. “I’m singing ‘Pirate Jenny’ as the blackship’s bearing down.” It’s a sly reference. The second most popular number form Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht’s <i>Threepenny Opera</i> (the first being “Mack the Knife”), “Pirate Jenny” is a stout song about bloody wish fulfillment: A bitter and beleaguered hotel maid imagines a marauding pirate ship destroying the city and murdering all the people who treated her so cruelly, ending with Jenny escaping with the swashbucklers and scallywags.</p>
<p>Faithfull famously performed the tune in the mid 1990s during a <i>Threepenny </i>revival in Dublin, and her fascination with Weimar-era musical theater inspired her 1997 album <i>20th Century Blues</i>, which includes her best version of the song. On “Give My Love to London”, Faithfull reimagines herself as Pirate Jenny returning to the scene of her greatest triumph and surveying a London still in ruins. Although the final verse resituates the song, it’s not hard to imagine Faithfull as the conquering anti-hero, especially considering how she was run out of the city in the late ‘60s for the same behavior that earned her male peers—including and especially <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23555-mick-jagger/"">Mick Jagger</a>—their lucrative reputations as bad boys.</p>
<p>And yet, there is some affection in “Give My Love to London,” which was co-written with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1283-steve-earle/"">Steve Earle</a>, now a Londoner himself. Faithfull navigates the bouncy melody gracefully and generously, evoking the easy bonhomie of old friends who have long put any ill will behind them. The song announces an album that will confront the past, her own and our own, as though trying to sever it from the present. This is not necessarily a memoir set to music, mainly because these songs find Faithfull playing roles other than herself. As a result, it’s her best and most daring album of this century, featuring some of her heaviest and most haunting performances.</p>
<p>Faithfull has spent most of the time since <i>20th Century Blues</i> fashioning herself into rock’s grand dame, an avatar of European decadence redeemed into something like old-world authority. Working with Britpop survivors (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/47-damon-albarn/"">Damon Albarn</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4769-jarvis-cocker/"">Jarvis Cocker</a>) as well as American alt-rockers (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"">Beck</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/952-billy-corgan/"">Billy Corgan</a>), she's made a handful of fine albums that persistently reinforce her reputation as a formidable interpreter of others' songs, as if anyone still though otherwise. <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2962-before-the-poison/"">Before the Poison</a></i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12548-easy-come-easy-go/"">Easy Come Easy Go</a></i> may have put her in touch with a younger generation of artists who considered her both a hero and an influence, but <i>Give My Love to London</i> is something else entirely. Working with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9990-roger-waters/"">Roger Waters</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/710-nick-cave/"">Nick Cave</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29393-anna-calvi/"">Anna Calvi</a>, and a band that features <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1887-ed-harcourt/"">Ed Harcourt</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"">Portishead</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7332-adrian-utley/"">Adrian Utley</a>, and members of the Bad Seeds, she has created an album that bristles with danger and even roils with anger.</p>
<p>But it also has moments of disarming humor. Toward the end of <i>Give My Love to London</i>, she gingerly covers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen/"">Leonard Cohen</a>’s “Going Home”, a late-career rumination on the nature of creativity. It’s a monologue delivered by a muse who considers Cohen “a lazy bastard living in a suit”—in other words, a tool no different than a pen or quill. Faithfull does not replace his name with hers; instead, she plays the muse herself, claiming his triumphs as her own. It becomes a melancholic hymn to age and experience, but more wittily, it’s a funny and fitting turnabout for a songwriter who has repeatedly exploited his female subjects for his own spiritual gain (see, for example, “Chelsea Hotel No. 2”).</p>
<p>Faithfull has always conveyed a sensual gravity with that gravelly voice of hers, but the melancholy on <i>Give My Love to London</i> is tinged with angst and disaffection—perhaps inspired by her recent bout with cancer, or the back injury that left her bedridden, or just by a sense of alienation from a world that makes less and less sense by the day. For most artists of her generation, such topicality can sound either haughty (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>’s recent orchestral protest song, ""Who's Gonna Stand Up"") or simply cloistered from the rest of the world (David Crosby’s latest album). But the theatricality of Faithfull’s performances lend weight to a song like “True Lies”, with its pendulum guitar riff and accusing lyrics: “True lies from your twisted little mind!” she glowers, her outrage absolutely withering.  </p>
<p>“Mother Wolf”, which Faithfull co-wrote with Patrick Leonard, may be her finest moment on <i>Give My Love to London</i>. It consists primarily of a single verse and chorus, each repeated throughout the song, but Faithfull sings each iteration with new dramatic emphasis. On the first time through, she delivers the allegorical lyrics almost passively, as though looking down on humanity from some high cloud. The next time, she has descended to earth and become a human amid the earthly horror of war. Faithfull doesn’t sing so much as she spits the words, her delivery grinding against the song’s meter. “How you disgust me!” she growls, turning those syllables into something acrid and poisonous and fundamentally ugly. Her performance meets violence with more violence, and the song’s pummeling pace and dark catharsis simultaneously underscore and undermine the song. The pirates are attacking London, and Faithfull is leading them onward. </p></div>"|19879.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19879-marianne-faithfull-give-my-love-to-london/|8.0|Stephen M. Deusner

From his teaming with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22051-kode9/"">Kode9</a> on the first-ever Hyperdub release to pivotal appearances on tracks by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/539-the-bug/"">the Bug</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27726-martyn/"">Martyn</a>, the poet and vocalist known as Spaceape lent his ten-ton doomsayer croak to dozens of definitive works of music and was positioned as the Linton Kwesi Johnson of the post-7/7, surveillance-state UK. His death of cancer earlier this month was a saddening shock, the second time this year after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31089-dj-rashad/"">DJ Rashad</a>'s tragic passing that a Kode9-championed artist passed away within a week of a promising new EP.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The main difference is that Spaceape knew he could be taken from us at any moment. The condition he had spent years living with informed his earlier work in ways that are only now becoming clear. Following the allusions in Kode9 teamup </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15310-black-sun/""><i>Black Sun </i></a><span>(""Black Smoke"") and his 2012 self-released solo EP </span><i>Xorcism </i><span>(""He Gave His Body Over to Science""), the five-song EP </span><i>Killing Season </i><span>further addresses Spaceape's physical condition and his ways of not only coping with it but extrapolating his own state of health to the sense of unease and trepidation that everybody stares down sooner or later.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Spaceape's voice is typically known for its deep resonance and chest-out intensity, and his presence on these tracks brings a few different shades of that tension to the fore. There's a nuanced shift from the grinding, exertion-wracked snarl of ""Chasing a Beast"" to the seething contemplation of ""Devil Is a Liar"", frustration and foreboding shot through with a need to connect with the listener. But his fervor borders on pleading with ""Heart"", the song that gives the EP its title and connects the tactile fragility of the human body to the forces that break it; here, his anger is shot through with empathetic sorrow that carries through the remainder of the EP.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Kode9's production has rarely sounded more in tune with his longtime collaborator than it does over these brief cuts, his spacious yet bass-heavy minimalism laid out to powerful effect as it keeps Spaceape's sharply articulated delivery in mind. While the instrumental-vocal pairings in their music has often been rendered interchangeable by design—their live sets frequently switched up beats and acapellas for effect—there are allusions and juxtapositions on </span><i>Killing Season </i><span>that make the mindstate of the words and the music inseparable.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The handful of cuts on this record play to both artists' strengths here, particularly the sprinting-through-quicksand blues lope of ""Chasing a Beast"" and the decaying, EKG-beep-inflected bass drone of ""Autumn Has Come"". But it's the briefest, sparsest one that cuts right to the core: There's a brittle, bell-like analog synth that chimes through the course of ""Pictures on the Wall,"" acting as the song's only instrumental element. Whether it's sourced from the electric piano/guitar intro to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3941-steely-dan/"">Steely Dan</a>'s ""Deacon Blues"" or simply evokes it by loose resemblance, Spaceape's bitter commentary on the ""tired old perceptions of human introspection""—taunting him from a hospital room he can't leave—feels like a clear-eyed but emotional counterpoint to the escapist boho romanticism of dying behind the wheel. Stephen Gordon didn't get the death he or anybody who heard his voice would have chosen. But his perspective on it—and the way it closes the book on a memorable, influential career—is what needed to be heard.</p></div>"|19929.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19929-kode9-the-spaceape-killing-season-ep/|7.8|Nate Patrin

Yet, there he is, cornered by comp. lit. majors, prattling on about their vintage typewriters, their well-stocked bookshelves, and—horror of horrors—their theses. ""I don't care about your first editions,"" Thomson vents midway through ""Marbles"", a highlight among highlights from Single Mothers' debut LP <i>Negative Qualities</i>, before adding ""at least I don't pretend my whole life's held together by bookends.""<br/><br/>Kiss-offs, kvetching fits, and a self-awareness Thomson himself deems ""crippling"": if nothing else, <i>Negative Qualities</i> is 2014's most aptly-titled LP. An airing of grievances in full-length form, <i>Negative Qualities</i> takes all comers: from starry-eyed barflies to farmer's market-shopping Saturn drivers, nobody comes out of <i>Negative Qualities</i> looking too hot. Certainly not Thomson; shortly after he's blah-blahed his way to the bar through the McSweeney's-spouting master's candidates, Thomson's labeled himself a hypocrite, the kind of part-time shitheel who sees ""the power in inflicting pain."" ""Tried to fight it, tried to hide it"" goes one such self-examination, ""but fuck it—I am who I am, and I'm not just gonna change.""<br/><br/>Thomson's lyrics are at once Single Mothers' main attraction and—for some listeners—their presumptive sticking point. It's rare to hear a lyricist lay out all their garbage in quite this fashion without putting a little more narrative distance between themselves and the words on the page. Thomson doesn't do that, not really; on ""Ketamine""—in which he cops to assisted infidelity and dubs himself ""good at avoiding things and bleeding into the scenery""—he actually calls himself out by name, leaving little question as to who's at the center of these songs.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>Negative Qualities</i>, a filter-averse Thomson does not exactly flatter himself; even the grand fuck-you he throws to a presumptive ex-lover on ""Money""—oddly enough, the album's prettiest song—skirts an awfully fine line between cutting and petty. While it's safe to assume Thomson is exaggerating certain <i>Negative Qualities</i> for effect, spending 26 minutes with Thomson's dirty laundry can leave one feeling a little unclean. Still, with <i>Negative Qualities</i> spraying insults at anyone who dares get too close, you're probably not supposed to like Thomson any more than he likes you. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Nayvadius</a> says, he's just being honest.<br/><br/>While Thomson rants, Single Mothers rage. That nourish guitar and loud-quiet-loud (well, maybe not ""quiet"") dynamics of ""Feel Shame"" and that atypically anthemic turn on closer ""Money"" notwithstanding, Single Mothers' gnarled post-hardcore proves every bit as unrelenting as Thomson's lyrical bloodshedding. It's not long on subtlety, but the music is nevertheless compelling, a full-on tantrum rendered in headknock drums and skull-smashing guitar. At times, this onslaught effectively drowns out Thomson's voice, obscuring the finer points of his fuck-all-ya'll manifesto in a sea of feedback. But that synergy mostly works; you lean in closer, only to be told to give the dude some space. Thomson's not a singer, he's a screamer, and in typically self-deprecating fashion, he's complained in interviews about a lack of range in his normal register. Still, for a guy who seems to see his larynx as a sparring partner, he gets a surprising amount done with it, sneering and gnashing his way through these songs with an impressively deft balance of sarcasm and self-loathing.<br/><br/>Spending the better part of a half-hour inside Thomson's head might not be your idea of a good time, and the unflinching—and frequently unflattering—<i>Negative Qualities</i>, while potent, isn't pretty. But the biggest mark against <i>Negative Qualities</i> isn't that Thomson's offering up too much of himself, but that he's snuck just a little too much of somebody else in there, too: namely, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2010-the-hold-steady/"">Hold Steady</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2479-lifter-puller/"">Lifter Puller</a> frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7532-craig-finn/"">Craig Finn</a>. At times, Thomson—by his own admission, a fan—seems to be directly channeling Finn, particularly the chattier, more biting Finn of <i>Fiestas and Fiascos</i> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3976-almost-killed-me/""><i>Almost Killed Me</i></a>. It's not just that so many of these songs are either set in bars, or the shitty little apartments you return to when the bars close for the night; several of these songs treat the tavern as a tabernacle (""Bar lights look like halos/ Making all the chicks here look like angels"") or otherwise lift from Finn's frequent juxtaposition of sensations (""A soft pillow on hard pavement""). It's a little strange, on a record so firmly embedded in Thomson's skull, to hear the occasional echo of somebody else's voice.<br/><br/>Still, where Finn and company of late seem to've ceded their spot as poet laureates of the pint-hoisting set to a crop of younger, gutsier bands—opting instead for something more universal, albeit considerably less potent—Single Mothers operate squarely in a very specific headspace: that testy two-beers-too-many space where your better judgment and your baser instincts get a little muddled. ""All I want to do is sit here complaining,"" Thomson admits, some 40 seconds before ""Money""—and <i>Negative Qualities</i>—grinds to a halt. Might wanna save the Henry Miller talk for somebody else.</p></div>"|19902.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19902-single-mothers-negative-qualities/|7.4|Paul Thompson

The line first scans as a refined upgrade of the band’s usual alienation—a dark basement swapped for an ivory tower. But it also has the same sardonic self-awareness that coats the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roB4hRdLlas"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">instantly iconic</a> video for <i>Plowing</i>’s first single, ""The Lord’s Favorite"", which featured the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHHEcmZtJvY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">really, really, really ridiculously good-looking</a> Rønnenfelt and his youthful comrades smearing lipstick on themselves, taking champagne baths, and enjoying cocktails with (d)ice in their glasses. ""Part of me wants to hurt you/ Tear in your hair/ But I don’t do that now,"" the singer admits, staring into the camera and lighting a cigarette as the band takes on tricky cowpunk shapes underneath his voice; it is, at the least, a unique approach to acknowledging newfound maturity.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Indeed, <i>Plowing Into the Field of Love</i> finds Iceage growing up on their own terms. Up to this point, they’ve developed incrementally, taking a knife to the rough-around-the-edges teenage fury of the 2011 debut LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15576-new-brigade/""><i>New Brigade</i></a> and cutting fresh, sharp ribbons of flesh on last year’s refined sophomore effort <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17623-iceage-youre-nothing/""><i>You’re Nothing</i></a>. Essentially a bolder, somewhat brighter update of what came before, <i>You’re Nothing</i> contained few hints of the baroque terrain that Iceage are traversing now. But the dense lockstep drone that closed out that record’s ""Morals"" suggested that Iceage could slow things down without losing their dead-eyed sense of passion.</p>
<p class=""p1"">On <i>Plowing</i>, Iceage make a radical shift away from their hack-and-slash past and towards what is, for them, unexplored territory—morose piano balladeering, sprightly country-rock figures, distinctly Irish-sounding drinking anthems. Their journey mirrors the transformation that the punks of the '80s underwent when devising the perfect alchemy of hardcore’s youthful burn and Americana’s weary shuffle (see Mekons, X, Meat Puppets). So Iceage aren’t exploring <i>new</i> sounds on <i>Plowing</i>, culturally speaking, but nothing they’ve done in the past five years suggested that they were capable of such a transformation. Despite the new approach, Iceage still sound like themselves, so when Asger Valentin’s mournful trumpet cuts through the rolling stomp of ""Glassy Eyed, Dormant and Veiled"", the most surprising thing about the instrument isn’t its mere presence, but how at-home it sounds amidst the band’s newly considered arrangements.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A sense of steadiness, a measured approach to abandon, marks Iceage’s transformation from a very good band to a Great Band on <i>Plowing</i>. While <i>New Brigade</i> contained bursts of unexpected melodic sweetness, the gruesome <i>You’re Nothing</i> often sounded like it was held together with little more than congealed blood and matted hair. On <i>Plowing</i>, the band swings to the opposite pole, sounding threateningly tight even when walking the edge of full collapse, similar to '80s-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a>’s balance of control and dissonance. Dark piano chords serve as an anchor for ""How Many""'s buzzsaw guitars, embracing a half-time tempo change at the song’s midsection that crashes through the burning scenery; ""Cimmerian Shade"" kicks off with a hollow pound courtesy of drummer <span class=""s1"">Dan Kjær Nielsen, accented by guitars both brawny and thin-sounding that abrasively scrape against each other. </span></p>
<p class=""p3"">Album centerpiece ""Stay"" somewhat hilariously opens as a waltz in 3/4 time, speeding up uncontrollably at the command of Rønnenfelt’s most operative, visually arresting lyrical aside on <i>Plowing</i> (""Hands/ Become thundering hooves"") before building to a furious burn that stands as Iceage’s finest moment of feral aggression. <i>Plowing</i>’s strangest moment, then, comes in the form of its most straightforward tune: ""Abundant Living"", the record’s only sub-three-minute song that one could reasonably listen to while skipping down a sidewalk. Jakob Tvilling Pless wields a jaunty mandolin figure over the band’s besotted sway, which takes on a Gaelic punk resemblance as Rønnenfelt promises in a miserable cadence, ""I’ll bring it all down here with me/ Soaked in alcohol.""</p>
<p class=""p3"">Rønnenfelt’s lyrics are front and center throughout <i>Plowing</i>—partially a result of his improved English, as he <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9508-iceage/"">told</a> Pitchfork recently—and they paint the type of self-portrait you’d expect from a punkish youth in his twenties: fatalistic, ferociously inquisitive, drunk on the promise of tomorrow and even drunker on whatever’s flowing from the tap at this very moment. Images of absent fathers, prison cells, and drowning are evoked, and the album’s parting line—""I am plowing into the field of love/ They will place me in a hearse""—reads as poetically grim as the limited perspective of youth allows. ""I have a sense of utopia/ Of what I truly ought to do,"" Rønnenfelt proclaims in the middle of ""How Many"", and that sense of gritted-teeth naïveté comes to define <i>Plowing Into the Field of Love</i> as a whole. This is the sound of Iceage finding a balance between getting older and seeking immortality by way of leaping into an abandoned-lot fire head-first. It’s beautiful and ugly at the same time and, for now, Iceage have found their own unstable sense of peace.</p></div>"|19806.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19806-iceage-plowing-into-the-field-of-love/|8.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

The music's appeal hasn't changed, but what it means has, at least where career-arc-plotting curiosity is concerned. Its release saw Aaron Jerome move from across-the-board multigenre remixer (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/300-basement-jaxx/"">Basement Jaxx</a>'s ""Scars""; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"">M.I.A.</a>'s ""XXXO""; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5304-mark-ronson/"">Mark Ronson</a>'s ""Bang Bang Bang"") to someone wielding a consolidated, self-contained signature sound, which gave his future endeavors a lot of promise.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">What SBTRKT means now, however -- especially in the wake of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17585-live/"">a you-had-to-be-there live album</a> and three underdone instrumental EPs tellingly named <i>Transitions</i>—is weighted down by the old expectation-dashing ""what could have been"" question. It's not always a given, but the sophomore slump for rising artists pushing into pop crossover potential is frequent enough that even looking at the guest list for <i>Wonder Where We Land</i> looks like a warning that he's tried to mess with the formula Too Much Too Soon. And the music bears it out: if you think the idea of an album that tries to incorporate scene-stealing hip-hop and indie rock figures into a once emotionally nuanced style is ominous enough, the execution is somehow even more chaotic.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Let's dig to the core first: three years would be a long time to wait for a slight re-envisioning of what worked the first time, but the finer points on this record nearly approach the better midpoints of the debut. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31502-sampha/"">Sampha</a>'s coolly ambivalent yet reservedly powerful vocals have always been one of the stronger elements in SBTRKT's arsenal, and he's all over this record: Fighting against a subwoofer earthquake with multitracked, reverb-blurred warmth that even makes the phrase ""what the fuck is that?"" sound cosmic on the title track, trembling his way towards a punch-back chorus on ""Temporary View"", alternately reining in and showing off his rangy melisma as he slides through the stripped-back disco-house of ""Gon Stay"". For an album that features one of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29991-jessie-ware/"">Jessie Ware</a>'s best icily delivered leads since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16938-devotion/""><i>Devotion</i></a> (""Problem (Solved)""), it's saying a lot that Sampha is the best thing going on this record.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's not saying too much, though. The two best singers on the debut are, perhaps not coincidentally, the two best singers here, while the bigger-name guests—the ones that stretch SBTRKT's sonic reach the furthest—just don't work. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27804-ezra-koenig/"">Ezra Koenig</a> isn't exactly the most egregious feature here, but the enigmatic jokiness of ""New Dorp. New York."" isn't done any favors by the free-associative lyricism. Are Black Israelites supposed to be wacky NYC cultural flavor? And is the line about ""baseball bats that never hit home runs"" a reference to threatening weaponry or just another joke at the Mets' expense? The two hip-hop crossovers trip up the album even more, not so much because they're not that good but because they just don't click with the rest of the album: singer/rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32477-raury"">Raury</a>'s run-on restrained intensity brings a personal edge that isn't done justice by its ambiguous coffeehouse surroundings. As for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30648-aap-ferg"">A$AP Ferg</a>'s soul-baring, shakily-singing turn on unlikely closer ""Voices in My Head""—detailing his self-medicating efforts to deal with his father's death—it feels so much like an ambush of untethered feeling that it pretty much washes away the more subdued pleasures of the Sampha, Jessie Ware, and Denai Moore cuts that precede it.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>With all the work to try and incorporate these far-afield guest vocalists aside, it's worth noting that the production itself is more reliant on them than ever. Underneath them, the music is often flat and unadventurous, tasteful where it could stand to be raucous and rigid where it needs to be limber. A two-minute arpeggio-riddled uptempo cut called ""Lantern"" is the most energizing moment here, as the rest of the backing tracks lean so heavily on darkly hovering minor-key bass murmurs, gloomy piano chords, and soppily distorted digital strings that it's easy to forget how intriguingly off-kilter some of his drums can be. From here on out, expecting SBTRKT to promise anything in particular is going to feel like a gamble, and probably a pointless one. But at least it's clearer than ever that there's a side to him which he's stronger at expressing.</span></p></div>"|19813.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19813-sbtrkt-wonder-where-we-land/|5.5|Nate Patrin

And while it’s still probably the best song of the Los Angeles singer/songwriter’s career, ultimately that’s a good thing. Tinashe’s post-“2 On” rise may have seemed sudden (and especially glaring, in a year where male voices overwhelmed the R&amp;B charts), but the 21-year-old is hardly a rookie. After devoting most of her teenage years to the Stunners, a Vitamin C-founded quintet that briefly toured with Justin Bieber, she spent the last few years at work on a steady stream of promising, if unpolished, mixtapes recorded in her home studio. Those tapes—filled with dusky ballads for spooning a laptop and sounding quite at home among the glut of zoned-out, “alternative” R&amp;B artists—got her a deal with RCA Records, but if the distance between her gently trippy mixtape work and the glossy ratchet-pop of “2 On” seemed potentially unbridgeable, it’s because she never intended to bridge it in the first place. Instead, </span><i>Aquarius</i><span> is an anomaly in an age of major label standardization: a debut done unmistakably on Tinashe’s own terms.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Much of <i>Aquarius</i> feels like an ambitious extension of Tinashe’s mixtape tracks, elevated to professional quality where they once felt muddled while leaving breadcrumb trails of idiosyncratic details leading back to her bedroom-producer past—distorted guitar solos, eerie found-sound interludes, somber spoken word bits. Sure, sometimes it’s a little much: wide-eyed lines like “What is truth, if truth is subjective?” read more like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4GneX1jj94"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>“Ever seen the back of a $20 bill </span><span>on weed</span><span>?”</span></a> similar to peer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29698-jhene-aiko/"">Jhené Aiko</a>, another recent indie-to-major transitioner with a penchant for dorm-room stoner koans. Mostly, though, Tinashe’s polished her act without dulling her edge, as the most interesting tracks on <i>Aquarius</i> come closest to approaching anything remotely like a radio hit—consider “How Many Times”, a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLmxKSdjiZQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>Janet Jackson-referencing</span></a>, late-'80s worshipping duet with Future so sultry it renders his shouty <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4_Luckf5bE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>“Sh!t”</span></a> flow as aphrodisiacal.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But Tinashe's most straightforward songs come with dark subtexts. Production-wise, second single “Pretend” has all the bite of an Avril Lavigne ballad playing during the break between ""Lizzie McGuire"" episodes (not necessarily a knock—somehow Detail’s mushiest productions are always his best) but the lyrics find Tinashe pretending her deadbeat boyfriend, played by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"">A$AP Rocky</a>, isn’t a scumbag so they can get it in a few more times. “All Hands On Deck”, the album’s sole answer to “2 On”'s club-readiness, has shadowy corners not often found in radio ratchetry, and that’s not counting the song's pan-flute breakdown: what first reads as a blithe dance instructional swiftly devolves into caustic post-break-up stunting, as Tinashe snarls, “Kiss the old me goodbye/ She's dead and gone.”</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-b442b0b4-db71-6409-ce35-9f3319b0d1cb"">Though Tinashe’s held on to the self-reliant tendencies that guided her mixtape days, the sense of disembodiment, sometimes verging on aloofness, that often present in her early work—a recurring pitfall of the production-driven “alt-R&amp;B” she once fit into—is mercifully absent. Somewhat paradoxically, too, working with a bigger team has made it clearer than ever that ultimately, she’s calling the shots; even with such a breadth of instantly recognizable collaborators, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31333-mike-will-made-it/"">Mike WiLL Made It</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"">Clams Casino</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32338-devonte-hynes/"">Devonté Hynes</a>, the vision remains wholly Tinashe’s throughout. As she’s shed the trappings of distinctly 2010s R&amp;B for something less easily time-stamped, she’s revealed a new and very telling set of inspirations, unmistakably the product of coming of age in the Y2K era of R&amp;B, where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10541-janet-jackson/"">Janet Jackson</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10601-aaliyah/"">Aaliyah</a> gracefully countered choreography-happy, big-budget smashes with flashes of something darker and deeply personal. </span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-b442b0b4-db71-6409-ce35-9f3319b0d1cb"">Tinashe has a bit of the coy, collected swagger of less canonical, ""Total Request Live""-era mainstays such as Mya or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10825-christina-milian/"">Christina Milian</a>, too—especially in the sauntering “Thug Cry”—but for all that early-'</span>00s worship, Tinashe’s unshakeable faith in her own vision could only really pay off in a climate like right now, where a record deal is hardly the end-all be-all to a legitimate career. If the risk-taking featured on <i>Aquarius</i> doesn’t pan out, she can do it herself—she already has—so why not use the momentum of the biggest song of your career to propel you in the complete opposite direction?</p></div>"|19910.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19910-tinashe-aquarius/|7.5|Meaghan Garvey

It’s austerely quiet until two minutes into the song, when a second instrument enters—a single crackle of electric guitar, sharp and splintery, like a log sparking in a fireplace. Amidon is settling in for a long story that is less about marriage and more about betrayal, violence, death, and loss. “Lily-O”, we soon learn, is a murder ballad, with one brutal stabbing followed by a long list of bequeathals. “Oh what will you leave to your brother John, oh Lily-O?” he asks. “The rope and gallows to hang him on.”</p>
<p>Despite the grimness of the subject matter, Amidon never raises his voice, preferring instead to deliver the tale with a calm that borders on psychopathic. He would rather let the other instruments express the characters’ hope and grief and outrage as best they can: that electric guitar gives way to a jittery acoustic strum, which is joined by a skittering snare drum and some stray electronic bloops and bleeps. Sounding as though the song’s guts are spilling out, the din is perhaps intended to evoke the psychological state of the murderer, or to provoke some moral response in the listener. The players certainly are up to the task: Amidon is an accomplished banjo player and fiddler, the scion of a family steeped in folk tradition, and he’s joined by the ace rhythm section of bassist Shahzad Ismaily and drummer Chris Vatalaro. And that chiming, slicing guitar is played by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1568-bill-frisell/"">Bill Frisell</a>, the legendarily eclectic musician who has performed with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4725-john-zorn/"">John Zorn</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3683-ryuichi-sakamoto/"">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/835-elvis-costello/"">Elvis Costello</a>, among too many others to list.</p>
<p>So why does both “Lily-O” and the album of the same title fall so flat? Recording in Reykjavik with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8718-valgeir-sigursson/"">Valgeir Sigurðsson</a> (who has produced albums by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/351-bonnie-prince-billy/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac"">Bonnie “Prince” Billy</a>), the makeshift band captured most of the album in single takes, playing together in the studio and indulging only minimal overdubs. Rather than producing a more urgent album or at least one that sounds rawer or wilder in its performances, <i>Lily-O </i>too often sounds distracted by small flourishes—the jazzy piano interlude between “Won’t Turn Back” and “Maid Lamenting”, for instance—at the expense of variation and shape. These songs are all pitched in the same mode and the same mood, as though each expresses the same dreamy reverie. As a result, the whole is persistently<i> </i>wistful, as its uniform tone overrides the nuance of the actual subject matter. In other words, the sorrowful “Maid Lamenting” and the contented “Devotion” strike the same chord of melancholy as the work song “Walkin' Boss” and “Groundhog Variations”, which is about frying and eating whistle-pig brains. </p>
<p>Somehow, <i>Lily-O</i> is Amidon’s most deliberate-sounding album, despite the spontaneity of its creation. He’s a fine instrumentalist with a wily sense of rhythm, especially when he bangs out the tricky patterns of “Pat Do This, Pat Do That”, but he can be a limited vocalist. Amidon sings every line in the past tense, even if it’s not conjugated as such, as though these songs are all memories fluttered around his brain during some lonely evening. The title track sounds like some repressed trauma gently resurfacing, yet Amidon cannot make those horrors sound immediate or dangerous. Every drama and every emotion sounds like it is safely put away in the past, with nothing to disrupt the present or to affect the living. On previous albums, Amidon has scrambled our sense of time by including old-time covers of new-time songs like Tim McGraw’s “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15030-sam-amidon-my-old-friend/"">My Old Friend</a>” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10546-tears-for-fears/"">Tears for Fears</a>’ “Head Over Heels”, but there is nothing on <i>Lily-O</i> to break the spell these musicians have too carefully cast. In other words, there is nothing to get Amidon out of his own head or out of our collective past. </p></div>"|19848.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19848-sam-amidon-lily-o/|5.9|Stephen M.

Immortal set their infamous videos in Arctic environments and branded themselves as ""<span>Blizzard Beasts""</span>, while the guitar tones of influential second-wave bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1274-darkthrone/"">Darkthrone</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26136-satyricon/"">Satyricon</a> resembled the winds of harsh winter storms; Imperial Crystalline Entombment took this obsession to its most absurd extreme, cloaking themselves entirely in white and envisioning a new Ice Age with their sole album <i>Apocalyptic End in White</i>.</p>
<p>Swiss trio Darkspace are concerned with a different coldness, though—specifically, the void and expansive unknown of the universe. Since their first (and only) demo in 2002, <i>Dark Space -I</i>, they’ve created and nurtured a style of black metal heavily indebted to dark ambient, both in the punishing drone of their riffs and in the minimal, chasmic soundscapes. Darkspace—comprised of Wroth and Zhaaral on guitars and vocals, and Zorgh on bass and vocals—apply corpsepaint to their faces like fellow traditionalists, but their appearance is slick and menacing, as if H.R. Giger was their creative consultant. They’re a futuristic black metal group that’s interested in the heavens, but not necessarily divinity. <span><i>Dark Space III</i> <i>I</i> </span>is their latest album six years after<i> Dark Space III</i>, and the new record represents an apt continuation of their signature style, cementing them as one of the most daring and underrated names in black metal.</p>
<p><span><i>III I</i> </span>is divided into three long chunks, leading off with the 27-minute-plus behemoth “Dark 4.18”. Glitchy spurts crack the veneer of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24724-lustmord/"">Lustmord</a>-like drone, resembling space debris whizzing by. Pulsating drums enter just before a distant lead pattern, and then the real punishment, the oppressive, almost speedcore-like rhythms, set in. The drum machine gives “Dark 4.18” a mechanical blast that almost borders on EBM, which connects the dots between black metal and electronic music, genres that embrace repetition as a means to an end. “Dark 4.18” is not dance music, mind you—the blasting is relentless, with guitars howling in pain to the stars above. No band captures cosmic indifference better.</p>
<p>One of Darkspace’s strengths is that they incorporate familiar metal elements and, through their galactic lens, render them foreign. They can’t help but be influenced by the mid-paced mastery of fellow Swiss resident and current <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32169-triptykon/"">Triptykon</a>/ex-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22778-celtic-frost/"">Celtic Frost</a> frontman Tom G. Warrior, which is plenty evident on “Dark 4.19”. The main riff is a groove held hostage, almost too catchy for its own good; it almost threatens the concentration that <i>III I</i> demands of the listener. There's tapping solos far removed from instructional video wankery, trailing towards parts unknown—rare flickers of light, with no flash. Wroth is also the man behind Paysage d’Hiver (where he records under “Wintherr”), a project that focuses exclusively on the frostbitten side of black metal; here, he mutates one form of coldness into another, seamlessly. </p>
<p>“Dark 4.20” finds Darkspace taking a meaner turn in their disorientation. The groove riffs sound choppier, and the blasting only grows more cacophonic as the song progresses. There are faint screams and growls throughout, which highlight Darkspace's tendency to de-emphasize vocals on <i>III I</i>. All three members are screaming into space, but that’s a lot of area to cover, and that helplessness is essential to Darkspace’s vision. At full speed, the guitars create a choral effect that's louder and more capable of communicating a sense of terror than any human voice could. It all ends with another low-rumbling hum, the nearly-quiet discomfort the album began with. There’s no comedown here—the battery stops, its oxygen stripped.</p>
<p><i>III I</i> is not an album of convenience. Music this pitch-black demands a state of isolation, from light and from people, to be fully appreciated. This is an album that takes the listener through a seemingly endless mirror of our anxieties about what constitutes “beyond”—beyond life, the Earth, the sun swallowing us, and our conceptions of black metal. <i>III I</i> asks a lot from its listeners, and it delivers one of the year’s best black metal albums in return.</p></div>"|19819.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19819-darkspace-dark-space-iii-i/|7.9|Andy O'Connor

After that, it seemed like her vision could take her anywhere—and “anywhere,” it turns out, was Vashon Island in Washington, where her latest album was<i> </i>largely written. For inspiration, she reached farther out still to the taiga—a type of forest typically found in Russia, desolate enough to border tundra and resilient enough to cover large swaths of the earth. “I like that idea that [the taiga is] full of life—it’s not desert. It’s very much full-blooded, but no one’s civilizing it,” Danilova told <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2014/07/03/zola-jesus-on-new-album-emtaigaem-i-had-to-overcome-a-lot-of-fear"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fader</a> earlier this year, and indeed, the taiga’s as fitting a metaphor for Zola Jesus’s music at its best as anyone could produce: cold like a mountain, brutal in its inhospitality, but life-affirming if you take the time to burrow in.</p>
<p><i>Taiga </i>is Danilova's “pop album,” a tag that's been somewhat overstated. Yes, it's her first full-length on the relatively deep-pocketed Mute, as well as her first with co-producer Dean Hurley (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5816-david-lynch/"">David Lynch</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1186-danger-mouse/"">Danger Mouse</a>); and, yes, she told <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6140763/zola-jesus-taiga-new-album-interview-dangerous-days"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Billboard </i></a>that she wanted the album to top the charts. But <i>Taiga </i>doesn't sound perky, lightweight, or even radio-ready. Lead single “Dangerous Days”, originally written for the 2011 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15897-conatus/""><i>Conatus</i></a>, has the makings of pop: a gentle throbbing beat, post-chorus synth comedowns, and lyrics that suggest a sideways view of a seize-the-day message. But it’s no closer to dance music than <i>Conatus</i>’ “In Your Nature”, and maybe even <i>less </i>hooky than fellow <i>Conatus</i> cut “Vessel”.</p>
<p>If <i>Taiga </i>nods at pop, it’s mostly in the songwriting–more streamlined, less atmospheric–and Danilova’s vocals, which are cleanly produced and more accessible. She’s mentioned studying <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna/"">Rihanna</a> in particular, and you can hear it in the low, “Diamonds”-smacking strain of “Hunger” ; pop-approaching styles are evoked elsewhere in the vocal swoops and R&amp;B curlicues of “Go (Blank Sea)”, the steady handclaps of “Hollow”, and the gentle-but taunting rhythm of “Dust”.</p>
<p><i>Taiga</i>'s strongest moments actually come when Danilova's sights aren't explicitly set on pop music. True to its title, “Hunger” sounds emaciated, with fuzzy brass, vague hints of a string section, and exhausted, skittish vocals; even the percussion break sounds like it’s been worn to the bone. Despite the pep-talky lyrics, it doesn’t sound like an anthem so much as a mantra clung to, half-breathless, during a fight. (“I’m not getting younger/ I use it, abusively,” is even more striking of a lyric when remembering that 25 is a fairly young age to mind the clock this desperately.) If “Hunger” sounds starved, much of <i>Taiga </i>sounds over-full, and not necessarily in a bad way: “Ego” calls back to <i>Conatus </i>by wielding film-score ambience to impressive effect, and the opening title track sets the stage with atmospherics, drops a drum-and-bass loop over it like sudden light, then stops things short with an imposing tectonic plate of a brass theme.</p>
<p>But too many songs on <i>Taiga</i> come across as filler—too small and formulaic to impress at ""taiga"" scale, but too leaden to reach anthemic heights. “I wanted to make a huge pop song that would break in and reach people I've never been able to reach,” Danilova told <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9455-zola-jesus/"">Pitchfork</a> earlier this year. In reality, pop's never been that far of a reach for her, so what’s most frustrating about <i>Taiga </i>is how much more huge it <i>could</i> be.</p></div>"|19893.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19893-zola-jesus-taiga/|5.9|Katherine St. Asaph

Karl Hyde and Rick Smith, to this day the nucleus of the band, were previously known for being in the synth inflected new wave band <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freur"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Freur</a>, whose “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pnQfPOFNLI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Doot-Doot” </a>was a minor hit in 1983. A couple of albums as Underworld followed, until that phase of the band flopped quietly to a close after a 1989 North American tour supporting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23572-the-eurythmics/"">Eurythmics</a>. It’s unlikely many people noticed the band had gone on hiatus, although Smith in particular appears to have seen it as a fresh start rather than an ignominious close. While Hyde stayed behind in New York, hurtling toward anonymity as a guitarist in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5498-debbie-harry/"">Debbie Harry</a>’s band, Smith was holed up in his studio in Essex, arguably the birthplace of rave, working on material with a much younger collaborator, DJ Darren Emerson.</p>
<p>The backwards way Underworld evolved was typical of similar UK acts of the era, most of whom were similarly inclined toward blowing dance and electronic music out into bigger spaces. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3169-the-orb/"">The Orb’</a>s Alex Paterson backed into ambient music through stints as a roadie for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29263-killing-joke/"">Killing Joke</a> and work as an A&amp;R man; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3394-primal-scream/"">Primal Scream</a> went from pleasant <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds/"">Byrds</a>-inspired jangle merchants to acid glazed indie-dance pioneers; Norman Cook, aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1463-fatboy-slim/"">Fatboy Slim</a>, got his start playing bass in the politicized effete rock of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Housemartins"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Housemartins</a>. The effect worked in reverse, too: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3402-the-prodigy/"">the Prodigy</a> were dyed-in-the-wool ravers who blew up by taking on certain characteristics of rock, even hiring a live guitarist with the none-more-punk name of Gizz Butt. Underworld’s roots were also in rock, giving them a sensibility that looked far beyond dance music's insular white-label culture, coupled with an approach that was more album oriented than the average dance act. In short, despite past mishaps, their ambition was completely off the charts.</p>
<p>It’s easy to ascribe this in retrospect, but Underworld’s ascent fits perfectly with the surge of confidence that flowed through both overground and underground music in Britain in the early-to-mid '90s. You can hear it in the sharply defined angles of jungle and drum'n'bass, or in the masterfully lethargic grooves of trip-hop, or, of course, in the major Britpop acts. In 1990, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26142-klf/"">the KLF</a> launched their “stadium house” trilogy (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28w2LVzxVkU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“What Time Is Love?”</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXEOESuiYcA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""3 a.m. Eternal""</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frIUgilfsWA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Last Train to Trancentral""</a>), giving it a name that suggested house was moving beyond the club and chart environs it had largely existed in up to that point. They weren’t wrong; by the end of the decade, bands such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3170-orbital/"">Orbital</a>, the Prodigy, and Underworld were headlining major stages at festivals in the UK. <i>Dubnobass</i>, released in 1994, is a key release in both that journey and the planet-sized thinking of EDM, which plays out as a further manifestation of its ideas.</p>
<p>This five-disc release offers an exhaustive trawl through Underworld’s archives from the era, presenting a fuller picture of where the band were at immediately prior to the release of this record. There’s a disc of singles, including vital pre-album tracks such as the version of “Dirty” released as Lemon Interrupt, and the all-encompassing “Rez”—the latter such a strong part of their identity, especially in its <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jst8yoqPTmo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">live incarnation</a> all wrapped up in “Cowgirl”, that it shows what riches they had on their hands that it didn’t make the final album. There’s also a disc of remixes, a disc of unreleased takes, and, most curious of all, an entire disc devoted to a series of live rehearsals that would become the <i>Dubnobass</i> tracks. The idea that these weren’t studio creations, but actually came out of something approaching live improvisation, feels improbable when hearing the strongly executed final product, although it’s likely a key part in explaining how adept Underworld were at pushing this stuff out into a live context.</p>
<p>The album itself has been considerably sharpened in its remastered form, with Smith taking it to Abbey Road and subtly pulling out textures that occasionally sounded muted on the original pressing. Hyde’s lyrics can still be problematic, with his cut-up style veering wildly between inspiration and moments of corniness, although the force of ideas on <i>Dubnobass</i> largely covers up the lyrical patchiness in ways other Underworld albums haven’t always managed. Here, he imbues the songs with a feeling of seediness, of bad sex and nights slumped in regret, giving the album a deeper undercurrent than something you can just get mashed off your face to in a club (although it also serves that purpose). Hyde’s at his best when lost in short mantras, such as the repeating verses of “Spoonman”, where he matches the trance-like flow of the music, his voice tweaked so it barely sounds human at times, becoming totally subsumed in groove and forward momentum.</p>
<p>The stretch through “Spoonman”, “Tongue”, “Dirty Epic”, and “Cowgirl” shows what acute listeners this band were, but it also highlights how skilled they were at assimilating contrasting ideas into their sound. “Tongue” borrows something from the ambient drift echoing through chillout rooms at clubs during this time, with Hyde multi-tracking his vocals in a way that makes him sound not unlike future collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>. On “Dirty Epic”, Underworld demonstrate their mastery of subtle builds and strange fusions, cutting plinky-plonky house piano across needlelike bursts of electric guitar, with Hyde’s central lyric (“I get my kicks on channel 6”) suggesting someone lost in a world as lonely as it is unsavory. “Cowgirl” remains their most carefully honed club banger, drawing on screaming acid lines and dense drum patterns that feel like a precursor to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"">LCD Soundsystem</a>’s “Yeah”. It’s not hard to see some of Hyde in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5462-james-murphy/"">James Murphy</a> and vice versa, especially as both were old hands coming to this game, bringing a dose of reflection to music that’s so often focussed solely on the now.</p>
<p>There are highlights in the rest of the material here (the Irish Pub in Kyoto mix of “Cowgirl”, the big beat workover of “Mmm...Skyscraper I Love You” in its “Telegraph 16.11.92” mix), along with things that are little more than historical curios (the 18-minute version of “Spoonman” on the rehearsals disc; the country-fied, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_Doves"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thrashing Doves</a>-indebted “Bigmouth” from the same disc), and an admirable willingness to put things out there that don’t appear to fit anywhere in their career (the lite pop/reggae of “Can You Feel Me?” on the disc of unreleased material, which feels like an unexpected callback to the Freur era). It’s a well put-together set, with a logic to each part that offers insight into Underworld’s working method, but never falls into the kind of barrel-scraping to which reissues like this sometimes have to resort. Mostly it’s worth it to hear how hard <i>Dubnobass</i> still resonates: this was an album about community, about coming together through shared experiences—a chance to take club culture out of the club without losing a shred of nuance or sheer visceral excitement.</p></div>"|19906.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19906-underworld-dubnobasswithmyheadman-20th-anniversary-remaster/|9.2|Nick Neyland

Already disbanded by the time their debut album, <i>Dum-Dum</i>, was released in 1989, ex-lovers-cum-ex-bandmates Eugene Kelly and Frances McKee should have by all conventional wisdom reconciled in the early ’90s to capitalize on their rarified standing as one of the most-covered artists in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a> discography (a benefit that did at least trickle down to a short-lived major-label deal for Kelly’s post-Vaselines band <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTOP-GZVJro"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eugenius</a>). Instead, they waited until 2008—just enough time for their biggest claim to fame to lose its currency to a new generation of kids <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGPbHUZQ-VE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">who may have a passing familiarity with “Smells Like Teen Spirit”</a>, but aren’t about to study <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6161-kurt-cobain/"">Kurt Cobain</a>’s record collection. </p>
<p>After the now de rigueur reissue/reunion-tour cycle, they released <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14631-the-vaselines-sex-with-an-x/"">Sex With an X</a><a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14631-the-vaselines-sex-with-an-x/""></a></i>—their first new album in over two decades—to show that age had no maturing effect on their puerile innuendo and bashful blasphemy. The record also seemingly gave the band a proper burial, putting a cap on a legacy they couldn’t have possibly imagined when they when they were strumming out lascivious lo-fi lullabies like “Rory Rides Me Raw”. After all, the last song on <i>X</i> was titled “Exit the Vaselines”, which, beyond its knowing full-circle allusion to the 2009 early-recordings comp <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12989-enter-the-vaselines/"">Enter the Vaselines</a>, </i>left us with a pitch-perfect epitaph: “It’s only goodbye.” For a band that became indie rock icons by accident, it felt like a suitably self-effacing note to go out on</p>
<p>As it turns out, there was still one matter of unfinished business to tend to. With no back catalog left to plunder and the comeback-LP angle already played, the Vaselines have effectively returned with the 20th-anniversary reissue of an album that never existed—in other words, <i>V for Vaselines </i>is the sort of radio-ready record Kelly and McKee might’ve released in 1994 had they stuck it out long enough to get signed by DGC, hire Gil Norton as producer, and score a fluke Buzz Bin hit to get sandwiched between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32173-veruca-salt/"">Veruca Salt</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"">Weezer</a> in heavy MTV rotation. That may not be welcome news for those who fell in love with the Vaselines for their off-the-cuff intimacy and try-anything-once grab-bag experimentation, but, in stark contrast to the predictable ’89-throwback slackness of <i>Sex With an X</i>, <i>V for Vaselines</i> is surprisingly the band’s punchiest, most polished effort to date. (That motorcycle you see McKee straddling on the hilariously Tom of Finland-esque album cover isn’t just some sexually suggestive prop, but the vehicle of choice for road-testing these power-pop pick-me-ups.)</p>
<p>Reportedly inspired by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9507-the-vaselines/"">a restoked appreciation for the Ramones</a>, <i>V for Vaselines</i> doesn’t so much approximate the bruddahs’ buzzsaw attack as their hooky immediacy, to the point where a casual mid-tempo gallop like “Inky Lies” feels every bit as spirited and effervescent as asphalt-ripping rockers like “High Tide Low Tide” and “Number One Crush”. But while the Vaselines may never totally outgrow their affinity for tawdry metaphor (“There was a time when all I had was sorrow/ But I met you, so I go boom with you”), <i>V for Vaselines</i> eases up on some of the cheekiness without sacrificing their charm, whether it’s McKee acknowledging her preference for slow-motion living in a totally wired world (“I’m not in it to win it,” she admits on the careening “Earth Is Speeding”), or hearing this playfully combative former couple restage a lovers spat on the beautifully breezy ballad “Single Spies”.</p>
<p>Even at a swift 34 minutes, <i>V for Vaselines</i> doesn’t always adhere to Ramones-like standards of brevity—the songs here tend to follow a verse-chorus-verse-chorus-chorus-chorus pattern that can make even a three-minute thriller like “One Lost Year” feel a tad overlong. But maybe all that repetition is the Vaselines’ way of saying of enjoy it while it lasts—on the “Just Like Honey”-dipped closer, “Last Half Hour”, Kelly and McKee sign off by singing, “Switch on, switch off, turn the lights low/ Final curtain, end of the show.” Whether this is indeed the end or just the set-up ruse for their next comeback, <i>V for Vaselines</i> leaves a lasting pop smear.</p></div>"|19855.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19855-the-vaselines-v-for-vaselines/|7.3|Stuart Berman

In 2011 they <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41691-rip-excepters-clare-amory/"">lost</a> member Clare Amory to cancer, and her partner, band member Nathan Corbin, decided he couldn’t continue in the group without her. Founder John Fell Ryan and his wife and bandmate Lala Harrison Ryan moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, then returned. It's been four years since Excepter's last full-length, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13929-presidence/"">Presidence</a></i>, so it's reasonable to expect<i> Familiar</i> to reflect this disarray, especially since their open-ended jams have always sounded on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But </span><i>Familiar </i><span>turns out to be one of the most focused efforts in this idiosyncratic band’s 12-year history. Some tracks are practically pop songs compared to Excepter's standard wandering sound, and even the more abstract pieces have distinct shape and purpose. Part of this is due to a plan </span><a href=""https://www.thefader.com/2014/10/03/interview-excepter-familiar-album"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>conceived</span></a><span> long before Amory passed away: to make songs with “familiar” instruments and melodies, some even nodding to nursery rhymes. The group had only a week to record during a 2012 European tour, so efficiency was at a premium; what makes </span><i>Familiar </i><span>impressive isn’t those goals (Excepter has veered toward conventional structure before), but that the results feel natural. There’s no sense of the band squeezing awkwardly into new costumes. Everything fits well; each sonic element is right where it belongs.</span></p>
<p>This unforced unity is clearest when comparing more melodic tracks to looser siblings. Opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16584-maids/"">“Maids”</a>, with Lala’s ethereal chants riding a wave of cresting beat, is their catchiest song since the ear-worming <a href=""http://youtu.be/2DrZ_L-txkw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“‘Rock’ Stepper”</a> (from 2006’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9278-alternation/"">Alternation</a>,</i> the only Excepter album that matches <i>Familiar</i> in sharpness). Yet “Same Address, Different City”, which sees John drooling like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6554-mark-e-smith/"">Mark E. Smith</a> over meandering electronic squiggles, manages to scale as high as “Maids”. Similar parallels emerge when you put new-wave-ish “Palace to Palace” next to mantra-like “Grinning in Your Face”: one relies on hook and the other on repetition, yet both build momentum without wasting a single breath.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The most thrilling example of </span><i>Familiar</i><span>’s laser focus comes on a seven-minute mini-masterpiece called “Destroy”. It's Corbin’s only contribution to the album, a piece he recorded with Amory when she was ill, in hopes of destroying her sickness with sound. Even though it was created separately from the rest of </span><i>Familiar</i><span>, it fully encapsulates the record’s strengths. Spraying whirring noise and morse-like transmissions over a pile-driving beat, “Destroy” is deceptively chaotic: jump to any point and it’s like waking up in a hailstorm, but chart it from start to finish and a near-classical sense of order emerges, with each element replacing its predecessor logically and mesmerizingly.</span></p>
<p>As if to emphasize the structured-ness of <i>Familiar</i>, Excepter closes the album with a cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4958-tim-buckley/"">Tim Buckley</a>’s 1970 ballad <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_to_the_Siren_(Tim_Buckley_song)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Song to the Siren”</a>. It’s the spot where the group most risks sounding like someone else, but rippling keyboard and Ryan’s long moans wash the tune in Excepter vibes. Still, it’s a daring move, and makes it tempting to paint this album as a complete rebirth for a band who deserves one. But their journey hasn’t exactly been linear, and they’re just as likely to throw a curveball next time as they are to continue down <i>Familiar</i>’s excellent, distinctive path.</p></div>"|19911.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19911-excepter-familiar/|7.8|Marc Masters

He spent 15 years hidden behind nested aliases: he was Malefic, or the sole member of <a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Xasthur/4936"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the one-man black metal mystery Xasthur</a>, and a one-time contributor to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32153-twilight/"">Twilight</a>. But Xasthur released its last record, the divisive <i>Portal of Sorrow</i>, in 2010, and Conner has since shed not just the corpse-painted nicknames but also the shield of distorted electric guitars, primitive drums, and hissing electronics that defined that band.</p>
<p>Now, credited under his own name (or, at the very least, “Scott C.”), he records thin, sullen acoustic music as Nocturnal Poisoning. In liner note selfies, he is clean-shaven and makeup-free. In interviews, he is confident not only about his decision to leave black metal behind but also his technical progression as a fingerpicking summoner of the blues, bluegrass, and country. “Nocturnal Poisoning is actually more technical than Xasthur was,” he said in a recent chat with <i>Noisey</i>. “It’s just more mellow and doesn’t have any of my mediocre drumming.” To that end, he titled the third Nocturnal Poisoning album in three years <i>Doomgrass</i>, an illustrative portmanteau of doom metal and bluegrass. The creation and naming of a new genre from whole cloth? That’s a pretty heavy burden to wrap around the neck of any project, especially the first album <i>not</i> to be self-released in a very limited edition. But Conner, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_One"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">who climbed inside a coffin to sing for Sunn O))) a decade ago,</a> has never been one for soft statements.</p>
<p>But the results are embarrassing. <i>Doomgrass </i>is an interminable 14-track slog through inconsequential guitar instrumentals and croaked-and-groaned high-school diary entries, laughably sung by Nocturnal Poisoning’s only collaborator to date, Robert Nesslin. The previous Nocturnal Poisoning albums have been mostly inoffensive affairs of acoustic strum-alongs, backed by modest percussion, mild effects and Nesslin’s occasional vocal contributions. As he’d been with Xasthur, Conner seemed comfortable with a defiant sort of primitivism, where the music’s cumulative effect and feeling mattered much more than the compositional acumen.</p>
<p><i>Doomgrass</i> would be difficult to appreciate just as a neofolk record, or even as a continuation of Death in June’s own shambling acoustic misery. Conner, though, is in the uncomfortable position of trying to pass off looped and delayed guitars as bona fide technical merit in two fields where skill can be difficult to fake. His “licks” are little more than a patchwork pastiche of sputtering arpeggios and bent strings, dispatched with the kind of lightweight tone that suggests a college freshman learning the tablature to “Dancing Nancies” on <a href=""http://www.guitarmasterclass.net/wiki/images/thumb/1/17/Ovation.jpg/350px-Ovation.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a used Ovation</a>. “Vagrant, Seeker of Empty Treasures” vaguely recalls Doc Watson’s heavy thumb and swift fingers, “Bet It All” the quick progressions of Clarence White. But there are entire skills absent from Conner’s set, and they limit him to the insulting side of passable. <i>Doomgrass</i> suggests a translation where the interpreter, though cocksure, knows one language well but only has a rudimentary grasp of the second tongue.</p>
<p>If that sounds rough, wait until you hear the words, and the way they’re sung. Conner wrote these lyrics, which amount to little more than dire reflections scribbled in the back of a notebook during a lunch break. There are misery clichés galore—“Roses you never smell,” “Become yesterday’s news,” and so on—and the prevailing sense that Conner has been too busy learning how to complain about life to live. He trades the experiential focus of the folk music he appropriates for empty lines about no money and dirty cities. Nesslin does his best to give the words the gravitas they demand, but his strained, dark-blues croon is mostly funny, as if he’s moaning these tunes from a toilet stall. Above the trebly guitar and light percussion of “Can’t Find the Sky,” he sings, “Life is a phase and a failed test/ Wait for God to clean up the mess,” doubling his voice so as to sound doubly mean. Try not to giggle.</p>
<p>Bluegrass, blues, and old-time music, like most all other folk arts in the world, can sometimes suffer assumptions that, simply because they’re old, they’re quaint and genteel. That is, we tend to teach our children Mother Maybelle Carter’s big-time version of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfNGgdHOahg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Keep on the Sunny Side” </a>rather than the apocalyptic meltdown of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxo-zayI6tE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“When the World’s on Fire”</a>, which she sang long before with her parents. But that view is a bleached and sterilized reality, of course, one that doesn’t recognize the way that this music has long worked as an anchor in times of crisis. Bluegrass and folk music at large are nothing if not full of doom—hell, <a href=""http://www.bluegrasslyrics.com/node/593"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Rank Strangers,”</a> the standard of the bluegrass gospel canon, essentially suggests that, if you leave home for too long, everyone you know will be <i>dead </i>(or at least gone) when you return.</p>
<p>So every antediluvian form that Conner tries to wrangle for his woe has a well-established pedigree of melancholy, but he seems to have missed that memo. That alone is not a reason to discount Conner’s attempt to weld doom metal to folk, but it’s certainly a reason to hope he could have as much deference for one side of that equation as he seems to have for the other. And maybe Conner will get there, since he seems newly devoted to practice, perfection, and building his repertoire piecemeal. Perhaps in a decade, <i>Doomgrass</i> will be a foundation for something that actually deserves to be called that. But for now, it’s hard not to hear these songs of self-pity and wish that, like a rank stranger, Xasthur would simply slip back into the shadows. </p></div>"|19800.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19800-nocturnal-poisoning-doomgrass/|3.0|Grayson Haver Currin

Back when he was still recording as Manitoba without fear of legal challenges from disgruntled punk veterans, he dissembled the IDM of the late 1990s and early ‘00s on debut <i>Start Breaking My Heart</i> before moving on to kaleidoscopic, colorful psychedelia on <i>Up in Flames</i>. From there, it was on to chugging krautrock and rich, melancholy ‘60s pop on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1805-the-milk-of-human-kindness/""><i>The Milk of Human Kindness</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10559-andorra/""><i>Andorra</i></a>, respectively; the 2010 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14157-swim/""><i>Swim</i></a>, cobbled together from leftover DJ set material and inspired by the sounds of deep house and contemporary club music, grew his fan base further. Despite the huge breadth of sounds they explore, these albums all share an essential playfulness and engrossing curiosity.</p>
<p>It’s always been enjoyable to hear Snaith dive deep into a new passion and emerge with a new record awash in the ecstasy of influence: finely detailed, in love with its inspiration, simply tuneful, and yet thematically complex. <i>Our Love</i>, his first album as Caribou in four years, is his first full-length that doesn’t come with a major shift from the sound of its predecessor. This is body music on the same general wavelength as <i>Swim</i>, albeit slightly warped and refined. The differences, then, are deeper: this is Snaith’s most overtly personal record to date, one that’s remarkable for its intimacy, openheartedness, and joy derived from basic human connection.</p>
<p><i>Our Love</i> is a quietly ambitious record, despite its modest title: in documenting Snaith’s personal vision of love, it seeks to render love in all of its universally complicated glory. It’s a warts-and-all depiction of a state of being that’s so often constrained to one or two facets in pop songs: obsession and disconnection, passion and jealousy, companionship and loneliness, all given equal weight. From the outside, Snaith looks the picture of domestic bliss, or at least stability—he’s been married for 13 years, and his first child was born in 2011—but many of <i>Our Love</i>’s lyrics hint at romantic trouble or marital discomfort. Nameless characters feel mistreated, are haunted by lurking suitors and bad memories, lament their broken love, look towards the future; when they’re in love, it’s with an intensity that verges on the maniacal. But it’s reasonable to conclude that the album’s songs aren’t near-direct transcriptions of events and feelings from Snaith’s life; instead, they’re extremes pulled from the necessarily complicated life two people build together over years and years, rich with joy but laden with baggage.</p>
<p>In any long-term relationship, there are moments of deadening melancholy where you feel like your organs have been put through an industrial shredder. It’s in those moments where you sniff at imagining your life completely different, or even with someone else—fantasies enabled by intense emotional pain. And then, somehow, things get better, and your heart is overflowing with love; you’re almost in disbelief, thinking, “How could I imagine a different life, even for a second?” <i>Our Love</i> captures the zig-zag between these two poles with an authenticity and honesty few albums manage, and the album’s excellent two singles, “Can’t Do Without You” and “Our Love”, focus on the latter sensation.</p>
<p>The kind of complex, slowly shifting relationship the album seeks to depict is mirrored by its own relationship to “dance music,” a term that’s broadly applicable to <i>Our Love</i> but awkward and inadequate upon closer examination. Snaith is an accomplished DJ, remixer, and producer, and he has a rock-solid grasp on the mechanics of the dancefloor: he understands how to get people moving, how to sustain intensity, and how small moves behind the boards can yield surprising results. A good example is the way he uses dynamic variation on highlights “Can’t Do Without You” and “Back Home”, using volume to make hooks hit that much harder. His 2012 record as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29516-daphni/"">Daphni</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17183-jiaolong/""><i>Jiaolong</i></a>, was a dance nerd’s delight, a lean and brittle release forged by crate-digging and the need to churn out hours of material for marathon sets at European clubs, and its influence is felt in subtle ways on <i>Our Love</i>.</p>
<p>This album is glassy, warped, and largely digital where <i>Swim</i> was bold, bright, and decisively analog in places; there’s a warmth to it, but much of it comes from Snaith rather than his largely digital soundscapes. That said, <i>Our Love</i> only really glances at straightforward dance composition before choosing to shrug it off and take a different path. Most of the album is too slow and strange for the club, and its songs mutate in ways that are unexpected and offer different kind of rewards. The title track spends four minutes building to a strobe-lit, wildly pulsing frenzy, only to turn left into a lovely string outro arranged by contemporary maestro <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6803-owen-pallett/"">Owen Pallett</a>, a longtime Snaith pal. The back half twosome of “Julia Brightly” and “Mars” are the two tracks that offer any kind of predictable dance-oriented pleasure, and even they’re a little off-kilter, with the former’s searing synth washes and the latter’s perky flute melody.</p>
<p>The key attribute is ultimately confidence. <i>Our Love</i> is a very assured record, from its unconventional, austere arrangements to its unrelenting focus and thematic consistency. This can be traced, in part, to Snaith’s solid collaborative circle: from respected advisors like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1548-kieran-hebden"">Kieran Hebden</a> and his wife to other artists like the aforementioned Pallett and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31482-jessy-lanza/"">Jessy Lanza</a>, he’s surrounded himself with people he trusts and appreciates, freeing him to take risks and pursue a pure artistic vision. Pallett’s arrangements on the title track, “Silver”, and closer “Your Love Will Set You Free” lend a lightness to an album that sometimes verges on uncomfortable depth; Lanza’s winning feature on “Second Chance” is a welcome dose of female perspective on a record dominated by Snaith’s, her melody and fluttering voice taking the album from one person’s love to something larger.</p>
<p>Speaking of voices, Snaith’s isn’t half bad either: a reluctant vocalist earlier in his career, he’s improved by leaps and bounds since then, lending an imperfect humanity to these songs even if he’s not quite carrying them. His imperfect delivery makes plenty of sense in this context, anyway: you can imagine him warbling these songs to his wife, or turning them into lullabies for his daughter. It’s a subtle cultivation of intimacy, but one that works in driving home the album's central conceit: that the love you feel for your partner, and the life and family you can choose to shape together, can be transformative. It’s hard work, and it’s not always easy, but it pays remarkable and lasting dividends. It can change your perspective and the effect you want to have on the world, and <i>Our Love</i> is a worthy tribute to that messy, unbelievably powerful force.</p></div>"|19762.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19762-caribou-our-love/|8.6|Jamieson Cox

Glam, folk-rock, post-punk, funk, rockabilly, and a certain ineffable <i>Marrness</i>— that ringing, swinging, intricate, atmospheric, hook-dripping soul— all dovetailed into a sound that still stuns. But while his erstwhile Smiths-mate Morrissey has taken his own primrose path down self-parodying mediocrity with this year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19603-morrissey-world-peace-is-none-of-your-business/"">World Peace Is None of Your Business</a></i>, Marr is doing the same on a lesser scale with his solo career. Which makes sense: Marr never had as high a profile or ego as Morrissey, and that low-key humility has made him a fan favorite.</p>
<p>But who knew that the least satisfying thing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2684-johnny-marr/"">Johnny Marr</a> could ever do would be launching a solo career? Yet here we are with <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56927-stream-johnny-marrs-playland/"">Playland</a></i>, the second official solo album by the former Smiths guitarist (or third, if you count <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5114-boomslang/""><i>Boomslang</i></a>, his 2003 album released under the name Johnny Marr &amp; the Healers). There’s not a sizeable difference between <i>Playland</i> and last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17643-johnny-marr-the-messenger/""><i>The Messenger</i></a>. Both feature listless songcraft, lackluster vocals, and a dull pulverization of every Britpop trope imaginable (not that imagination had anything to do with the making of this record). Worst of all, though, is the oppressive truth lurking behind almost every tired lick and lazy lyric of <i>Playland</i>: Marr can, and has, done so much better.</p>
<p>We root for him, though, and in return he gives us <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_P5iSG_APE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Easy Money”</a>, <i>Playland</i>’s lead single, a silly, clumsy fumble of a song that can’t click into shape. Is it supposed to remind us that money is a bad thing, or that it’s ironic how millionaire musicians still feel the need to sing about it? It doesn’t matter, because the song's only notable element is Marr’s perpetually dated musical taste, as the slashing, squelching rock of “Easy Money” feels about as fresh and inspired as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2383-kaiser-chiefs/"">Kaiser Chiefs</a>. </p>
<p><i>Playland </i>isn’t all bad: “Boys Get Straight” is as breakneck as the Smiths’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PShfGsFr6d4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“London”</a>, and that energy almost carries it over the finish line, despite a poverty of hooks. “Little King” isn’t any more original—its sinuous intro could be a page in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26609-echo-and-the-bunnymen/"">Echo &amp; the Bunnymen</a> songbook, an nearly funny gesture seeing as how the Bunnymen were one of the Smiths’ chief rivals in the '80s— but Marr spins that into a tuneful, propulsive bit of diversion anyway. The album’s title track is its only glimmer of Marr’s worship of vintage glam, but what might have started out as filthy, flashy rock in the practice space has been pasteurized to the point of blankness.</p>
<p>Marr’s tendency to sing like his former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50126-johnny-marr-and-new-orders-bernard-sumners-project-electronic-to-reissue-debut/"">Electronic</a> bandmate, New Order’s Bernard Sumner, might be flattering to Sumner but proves embarrassing otherwise; the pinched, boyish, breathy style serves Marr adequately on tracks like “Dynamo” and “The Trap”, but it doesn’t come across as conveying emotion and melody as much as it does him doing vocal exercises. If his curious status as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"">New Order</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"">Joy Division</a> fanboy is in question, he titles two consecutive tracks on <i>Playland</i>— either consciously or not — after Joy Division songs: “Candidate” and “25 Hours”. They do exhibit a trickle-down trace of that same dark, stark atmosphere, but rather than coming across as an homage, the resemblance seems fawning at best, insecure at worst.<b> </b></p>
<p>A lack of effort isn’t the main problem with <i>Playland</i>; if anything, there’s been <i>too</i> much effort put into it. It’s been fussed over so much that any spark that may have spurred it has been smothered. As Marr continues to staple pages to his résumé—and the prospect of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51854-echo-chamber-johnny-marr-on-people-who-want-the-smiths-to-reunite/"">Smiths reunion</a> becomes even more remote—<span>the disconnect between the iconic architect of '80s indie and the journeyman who’d rather follow than lead grows</span>. In an interview with the <i><a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/johnny-marr/80129"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NME</a></i>, Marr cited “boredom” as a big inspiration on <i>Playland, </i>and all it takes is a listen to prove it.</p></div>"|19892.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19892-johnny-marr-playland/|4.6|Jason Heller

He plays his guitar with a traditional precision, his eyes gazing at the neck, his fingers moving limberly around the frets, a thumb pick doing the most economical work. He’s austere as someone with no need to go anywhere anytime soon. His songs stretch and loom like a dust storm. Time, it seems, bows to him.</span><span> </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Gunn’s career shows a similar sense of patience: zoomed out, it looks like a 9-year crescendo, whose highlights include his earliest limited-run solo guitar improvisations, his work as a duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15003-sand-city/"">with drummer John Truscinski</a>, a sideman in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"">Kurt Vile</a>’s band, the spine of the psych-folk supergroup <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/miemusic/sets/black-dirt-oak-wawayanda"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black Dirt Oak</a>, on up to last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18176-steve-gunn-time-off/""><i>Time Off</i></a>. That last record was a statement, casting Gunn as not just an instrumentalist, but a damn fine songwriter, too, as ambling, cyclical guitars loped and folded among verses, choruses, bridges, and his doleful baritone. They were simple songs, produced with plenty of dust and hiss all over the tracks, and <i>Time Off</i> was Gunn squinting at something big on the horizon.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">His latest, <i>Way Out Weather, </i>is<i> </i>the fully formed pinnacle of his career. With a full band and plenty of instrumentation behind him, the care he puts into every nook and cranny of a song is evident. It’s lush but without lacquer, detailed without being dense. These songs live in hollowed out holes of America’s past; it’s as easy to imagine him playing in front of a disused gas station off an Oklahoma highway as it is to hear his band booming out of a roadhouse on the Mississippi Delta. At times, there’s so many guitar tracks it it feels like in the middle of a pickup jam session with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22079-jerry-garcia/"">Jerry Garcia</a>, Duane Allman, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1437-john-fahey/"">John Fahey</a>.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Among the strides Gunn has made on <i>Way Out Weather </i>is his singing voice. His baritone has a perfect character to it, somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3550-lou-reed/"">Lou Reed</a> circa <i>Loaded</i> and a toothless barfly who occasionally breaks into song. He falls off the ends of notes as if the energy to sing them is out of reach, yet he avoids the kind of droll, wondering vocal style used so liberally and effectively by his contemporaries <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs/"">Adam Granduciel</a> and Vile. Instead, Gunn hones in on every pitch, like on the the lilting waltz of “Shadow Bros"", which is the closest thing you'd call a traditional folk song here. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">There's so much space inside these songs: the opening title track is a six-minute stroll through tendrils of guitars—a lap steel in the background, a strummed acoustic just beside it, a picked acoustic just in ahead of that, and a clean Fender lead right up front. Even when these sounds aren't washing over you, like the simple country blues riff that runs through “Wildwood”, hearing these melodies is a delight. He sings of private rivers, slowly moving light, fast nights, long days, and moving inside dreams.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">It’s not all swaths of guitars and natural nostalgia, though: Gunn turns it up with “Drifter”, a balled up and electric stomper, and <i>Way Out Weather </i>closes with an excellent climax, “Tommy’s Congo”, a swirl of psych, krautrock, Malian folk, and a slight nod to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a>’s cadence on “It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding)”. Gunn may have been more experimental-leaning on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19442-steve-gunn-mike-cooper-cantos-de-lisboa/"">Cantos de Lisboa</a>,</i> his collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32328-mike-cooper/"">Mike Cooper</a>, but this song gathers up all his improvisational tendencies and eclectic influences, bringing unheard textures to his music that are somehow still cut from the same cloth. He closes the album in a voice that's never sounded more certain: “Steady eyes on the crowd to see what’s going down/ Never once looked down at what they’re playin'/ Never look down at what you need to do.” His eyes are trained far somewhere far in the distance, waiting for what’s next.</span></p></div>"|19821.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19821-steve-gunn-way-out-weather/|8.0|Jeremy D.

He writes simply worded lyrics about commonplace emotions triggered by often mundane events, and while the additions from Amy Cole and Paul Banwatt are crucial, the arrangements remain minimal. But the long incubation makes sense, as their best music tends to emerge only after a kind of latency period—what initially sounds and feels small ends up resonating over time.</span></p>
<p>Characters detailed in RAA songs are often in danger of having emotional catastrophe sneak up on them, brought to light by an ex’s keys or the encroachment of hopelessness in a small town. After an overly muted sophomore release in 2011’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15079-departing/"">Departing</a></i>, Edenloff wisely sought out more immediate threats to his security while writing <i>Mended With Gold</i>. Taking on the Ontario Rural Disadvantage of <a href=""http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/on/bruce/index.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bruce Peninsula</a>, he was subject to the unpredictable cold, as well as the occasional black bear and wolf milling about. There isn’t much lyrical evidence of his Bear Grylls method acting—“To Be Scared” and “Runners in the Night” still speak of more of existential crises than primitive fight-or-flight—but if RAA gained confidence by surviving in the wilderness and recognizing how precious and fleeting our time on earth can be, it’s manifested in what is, by a wide margin, their boldest and most ambitiously recorded album.</p>
<p>The format of Rural Alberta Advantage hasn’t changed; you still get Edenloff’s pine-needle tone, Banwatt’s hyperactive drumming on a minimal kit, and the occasional wispy harmony or simple keyboard texture from Cole. It often recalls the performative recklessness that marked their enduring debut <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12739-hometowns/"">Hometowns</a></i>—however, the rickety, ramshackle recording has been replaced by a mix that makes RAA sound like a proper rock band. For the first ten seconds of opener “Our Love…”, Edenloff’s voclas and palm-muted acoustics are as thin as ever, but the rest of the band comes in furiously thrashing, and although <i>Mended With Gold</i> doesn’t always match that pace, even the quiet moments lunge out of the speakers.</p>
<p>The production certainly plays a role in this, but RAA’s new strike-first and strike-often musician is due to the band troubleshooting the #1 issue of <i>Departing</i>, which was the baffling marginalization of Banwatt. They haven’t released an album since Jayson Gerycz joined <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28679-cloud-nothings/"">Cloud Nothings</a>, and here it sounds like Banwatt is trying to retake his spot as having the highest <a href=""http://www.baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?search=VORP"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""value over replacement drummer""</a> in indie rock, a guy who singlehandedly elevates otherwise standard rock songs into something proprietary. If you turn your ear a certain way, the massed choruses of “Terrified” and “To Be Scared” echo the ho-heys of arena folkies like the Lumineers or Of Monsters and Men, though their rusticity and earnestness projects from the inside-out. One can assume Banwatt draws on the pent up stress from his <a href=""http://lawandstyle.ca/career/secret-life-bang-on/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">day job as an intellectual property lawyer</a> to ensure the anxiety of Edenloff’s lyrics project from the inside-out as well, and numerous songs on <i>Mended With Gold</i> are custom built for him as a showcase<span>—</span>the second half of “On the Rocks” gives way to a  extremely loud drum solo, ""All We've Ever Known"" is damn near blast-beat folk, whereas “The Build” is pretty self-explanatory. Regardless of your tastes, if you care about drums at all, <i>Mended With Gold</i> is a must-listen.</p>
<p>But while <i>Mended With Gold</i> gives the Rural Alberta Advantage their most broad and expansive sound, the lyrics are at their most broad as well. Edenloff sounds more like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5758-in-the-aeroplane-over-the-sea/""><i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2659-jeff-mangum/"">Jeff Mangum</a> than Jeff Mangum himself these days, which only emphasizes how his increasingly plainspoken lyrics lack the distinct character that made <i>Hometowns</i> such a subtle pleasure.  From the titles alone, you can predict what “Our Love…”, “On the Rocks”, and “This City” are getting at, which more represent generalizations of relationship impasses than lived-in descriptions of them, though the latter possesses distinctly Canadian rhyming of “toque” with “rust-covered coupe.” Still, it's only an occasional cut against their charms—RAA don't have the element of surprise like they did on the originally self-released <i>Hometowns, </i>and it doesn't slowly ingratiate the way <i>Departing </i>did, but <i>Mended With Gold </i>proves Edenloff's songs of lost love can sneak up on you even when the music hits you square on the chin.</p></div>"|19735.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19735-the-rural-alberta-advantage-mended-with-gold/|6.9|Ian Cohen

The band’s 1990 single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmJxWENBW7Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Commercial Rain”</a> crystallized everything Madchester was about, at least where it counted most: on the dancefloor. Swirling and sinewy, it split the difference between hippie trippiness and punk simplicity. Mostly, though, it had a hypnotic hook that was more relentless than even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12208-the-stone-roses/"">the Stone Roses</a>’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBsazIACpYM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Fools Gold”</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5891-happy-mondays/"">Happy Mondays</a>’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CQLAhNlbfQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Step On”</a>, songs that are more widely recognized as embodying Madchester’s ecstasy-fueled zeitgeist. Inspiral Carpets were neighbors of the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays in Greater Manchester, but they always seemed from another place entirely: harder edged, more potently focused, and far less concerned with the finer frills of stardom. If the Stone Roses were Madchester’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a>, and Happy Mondays its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"">Rolling Stones</a>, Inspiral Carpets were its iteration of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4592-the-who/"">the Who</a>. </p>
<p>Naturally, they were nowhere near as successful as their contemporaries; after a handful of modest hits, Inspiral Carpets broke up in 1995. They reformed in 2003, but seemed ready to collapse once again when longtime frontman Tom Hingley quit unexpectedly in 2011. The group instantly rebounded by recruiting their original singer, Stephen Holt, who had cofounded Inspiral Carpets in 1983 before leaving in 1989, just before they hit their peak of popularity. The result of that reunion with Holt is <i>Inspiral Carpets</i>—their first album in 20 years, and their first proper studio full-length with Holt at the helm. </p>
<p>The biggest difference is Holt’s voice itself. It hasn’t matured or strengthened since the band’s early EPs with him, back when they tended more towards organ-slathered garage rock than the funkier forms of Madchester. Where Hingley sang with understated soul and nuance, Holt is more or less an adenoidal punk barker. He knows two notes, one for each nostril. But where Happy Mondays’ Shaun Ryder compensated for a similar limitation by owning every square inch of his tuneless delivery and injecting it with brilliantly loopy lyrics, Holt just squawks. On “You’re So Good for Me”, he strings together empty banalities like “Something’s gotta give/ I’ve gotta keep on moving/ I’m struggling to be heard/ But my time is coming,” and instead of putting any conviction behind his salesmanship, he just reads the pitch off the page.</p>
<p>Being the most punk of the original Madchester bands, Inspiral Carpets should mesh beautifully with Holt’s raw vocals here, but the music behind him doesn’t do him any favors. “A to Z of My Heart” trots out every organ riff that ? and the Mysterians and the Music Machine used, making them sound tired instead of tense. What was once impassioned homage now sounds like simple muscle memory. “Let You Down” is one of the album’s few triumphs of appropriation, with a generic, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPDixDqAUh0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Gloria”-as-played-by-Ray-Manzarek</a> vamp played by organist Clint Boon with a groovy fury, and a guest verse by grizzled punk-poet John Cooper Clarke that not only shatters the album’s tedium, but also echoes one of Inspiral Carpets’ finest moments: enlisting fellow Mancunian Mark E. Smith of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1445-the-fall/"">the Fall</a> to wax avuncular on their 1994 single <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPTpBoYVD8Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“I Want You”</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond that, only the spirited, psychedelic chug of “Spitfire” and the handclap-catalyzed go-go of “Hey Now” come close to clicking with—let alone recapturing—any portion of the band’s former glory. The remainder of the record is filled out with either bland mediocrities or downright embarrassments such as “Flying Like a Bird”, a sappy ballad that sharply delineates every weakness <i>Inspiral Carpets</i> has, from a dearth of energy to a lack of melody. Strangely enough, one track from this Holt-led album goes out of its way in an attempt replicate the group’s Hingley-era, Madchester peak. “Forever Here” is the only stretch of <i>Inspiral Carpets</i> that dares to be funky, and for a fleeting three-and-a-half minutes, the acid-punk specter of “Commercial Rain” rears its majestic, genre-defining head. Then, it’s gone. </p></div>"|19738.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19738-inspiral-carpets-inspiral-carpets/|4.2|Jason Heller

From <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9740-1983/"">his year of birth</a>, he moved on to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12132-los-angeles/"">the city he found his musical identity in</a>, then out to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14198-cosmogramma/"">the very structure of the universe</a>, then <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17115-until-the-quiet-comes/"">deeper inside to the inner world of dreams and the subconscious</a>. His fifth album, <i>You're Dead!</i>, has the stated theme of the one thing every single human has in common, and just about every conceivable style of music is prone to address: the inevitability and condition of death, and how mysterious it really is.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like many people who've grown past 30 years old, Steven Ellison has lost some important people in his life. Specifically, they were artistic inspirations—from collaborators like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30905-austin-peralta/"">Austin Peralta</a> to influences like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla"">J Dilla</a> to blood relatives like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5881-alice-coltrane/"">Alice Coltrane</a>—formative catalysts that made his music and his life what it is. Coltrane in particular is frequently brought up as a familial connection to Ellison, but even if she weren't his great-aunt, her meditative way of being in the world and putting forth music as a way of spiritual connection has carried through deeply into Ellison's own art, even when it appears irreverent or cartoon-ridiculous on the surface.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The title of </span><i>You're Dead!</i><span> has that exclamation point for a reason, though. While the spirits of his friends, family, and peers weigh heavy throughout this album, the music itself is frequently light and sometimes shamelessly </span><span>goofy</span><span>, treating mortality with the irreverence and fascination of anything inescapable and unknowable. There's little that's morbid and even less that's melancholy about it. In the context of coping with The Other Side, it all feels a lot more like a wake than a funeral.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And consider the guests at this particular wake: pianist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12521-herbie-hancock/"">Herbie Hancock</a>, likely legacy-minded as he continues to branch out and find new musical environments through his seventies; rappers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4102-snoop-dogg/"">Snoop Dogg</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, the latter whose insight towards death has the subtle heft of somebody who's cheated it while being well aware of those who didn't; guitarist Brendon Small, whose involvement in the gory cartoon absurdity of ""Metalocalypse"" prepped him well for an album that sounds equally informed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7559-slayer"">Slayer</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15826-raymond-scott/"">Raymond Scott</a>. Even the album art and promotional visuals, provided by the body-horror guro manga artist Shintaro Kago, revels in the idea of nightmarish evisceration and dismemberment rendered with an almost playful slapstick weirdness.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The theme sticks out as the most consistent element of <i>You're Dead!</i>, since it's far and away the most free-ranging FlyLo album to date. And yet the album doesn't sprawl out of control, maybe because it doesn't really have the time to: the whole record clocks in at just over 38 minutes, all jolts of sound and quick bursts of motifs. The fleeting cross-sections of chopped-to-bits fusion jazz strung together over the first five minutes—the ascendant cosmic drone and black hole collapse of ""Theme"", the fast-forward bop of Hancock collab ""Tesla"", and the careening hesher-Sharrock guitar licks of ""Cold Dead""—flow from buzz-cluttered headspaces to spacious serenity so unexpectedly yet naturally that the seams never show. (The live-band personnel—including prog/jazz superdrummer Deantoni Parks, Ayler-school saxophonist Kamasi Washington, and ever-present partner/bass wizard <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"">Thundercat</a>—do a masterful job in turning concentrated doses of high-speed, complicated chops into giddy bursts of euphoric adrenaline.) Kendrick Lamar's virtuoso obstacle-course run through the d'n'b-tweaking ""Never Catch Me"" is the closest there is to a centerpiece statement of the album (""Analyze my demise, I say I'm super anxious/ Recognize I deprive this fear and then embrace it""). But the tonal 180 into the buoyant, kind of tipsy/faded <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30595-captain-murphy/"">Captain Murphy</a>/Snoop Dogg teamup ""Dead Man's Tetris""—complete with a riff-echoing gun-cock collage and <i>Street Fighter II</i> K.O. SFX—is less of a jarring shock than a knowing counterpoint.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">From there, the album's remaining path through prog, fusion, IDM, and ambient all feels like a necessary comedown, shot through with moments at the precipice of chaos or deliberate ugliness (like the pill-popper nightmare of Captain Murphy croak-wailing through ""The Boys Who Died in Their Sleep""), but still resiliently calm in the face of death. Ellison's once-sparse use of others' voices is especially haunting at points—Angel Deradoorian's breathily manipulated into weaving through wispy psychedelic soul like some minimalist version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a>'s ""The Great Gig in the Sky"", or Niki Randa harmonizing at a distant horizon through ""Your Potential//The Beyond"". A lighter hand, even when it's punching up bass drones or pushing through dense walls of complex instrumental interplay, makes the end-of-humanity choral hymn ""Coronus, the Terminator"" and the pull between intense rhythm and delicate melody on ""Moment of Hesitation"" feel infused with just as much wonder and awe as foreboding.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">There's the idea expressed through <i>You're Dead!</i>—intentional or otherwise—that making a life's work with the full knowledge of death as the final limiting factor is a strong motivator. Flying Lotus has the notion that death should be the only limiting factor, and when he's put out a work that wrings beauty out of that very thing, what's the point of fearing anything?</p></div>"|19875.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19875-flying-lotus-youre-dead/|8.3|Nate Patrin

His anecdote was good for a sick laugh; Broadrick can be funny, despite his reputation as a poker-faced purveyor of extreme metal, shoegaze, and industrial music as a former or current member of the British groups <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5443-napalm-death/"">Napalm Death</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2238-jesu/"">Jesu</a>, and the resurrected <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32310-godflesh/"">Godflesh</a>, among others. But his silly story about genocide is also indicative of the way absurdity and security can go hand in hand, especially in a world where safety is, at best, a collective hallucination. Its guarantors can’t even keep knife-wielding maniacs from sprinting into the White House, let alone regular people from being beheaded. Existence, even with all its modern safeguards, is fragile, and rarely does it feel more so than when you’re listening to Broadrick’s music. </p>
<p><i>A World Lit Only by Fire</i> is Godflesh’s first album in 13 years. Their last, 2001’s <i>Hymns</i>, effectively disassembled itself in order for Broadrick to scavenge its chassis for scraps, which he then used to build Jesu. Most obviously, the final track of <i>Hymns</i> is titled <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aS5fI8Tqz4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Jesu”</a>— but instead of being a swansong, it was a two-part, 13-minute <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-41fuJNjZM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">premonition</a> of what was to come. Jesu went on to indulge Broadrick’s latent love of shoegaze and melody, but it retained every milligram of Godflesh’s heaviness; when Broadrick issued Godflesh’s comeback EP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19482-godflesh-decline-and-fall-ep/""><i>Decline and Fall</i></a>, earlier this year, it wasn’t so much a return to form as a transference of force. But where <i>Decline and Fall </i>unlocked the door, <i>A World Lit Only by Fire </i>knocks down the entire wall surrounding it. “New Dark Ages” is the record’s method of entry, and it’s accordingly annihilative: A spindly beat pulls back the skin to reveal sleek, minimalist musculature, and those riffs crush Broadrick’s windpipe as he gets biblical with his opening warning: “Don’t look back/ We’ll dissolve”. The resurgence of fundamentalist medievalism have been a concern of industrial music ever since SPK’s 1983 classic <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YhxorQxlp0&amp;list=PLJLuntoFDTocNPkSrMii0MHfavd_ccLcd"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Another Dark Age”</a>— and “New Dark Ages” casts that creeping fear in a coat of millennial chrome.</p>
<p>Much of the album doggedly refuses to deviate from the template of “New Dark Ages”, which itself isn’t that much of a departure from what Godflesh laid down on their 1989 debut album, <i>Streetcleaner</i>. The roboticized crust of the Godflesh of old, though, has been trimmed to fit an even bleaker era. Instead of being discreet compositions, these songs are segments of a single continuum, amputated from each other. “Shut Me Down”,“Curse Us All”, and “Carrion” flow into each other—inasmuch as anything on such a tense, brittle album could be said to flow—with an almost martial uniformity. The distinctions are in the shades of texture and syncopation. In some places, bassist G.C. Green evokes the corroded-carburetor clang of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/9468-steve-albini/"">Big Black</a>; elsewhere, Broadrick’s righteous roar gets caught in the gears of the album’s drum-machine march, if not the hopelessness of its protests.</p>
<p>Broadrick first flexed his skills as a slightly more conventional singer/songwriter in Jesu, but he’d begun exploring tunefulness toward the end of Godflesh’s first run. That eerie blend of ugliness and melody doesn’t crop up often on <i>A World Lit Only by Fire</i>; when it does, it’s for terrific effect. “Life Giver Life Taker” and “Imperator” mix wailing echoes and spectral chants with chiseled riffs and insectoid rhythms, while “Towers of Emptiness” and “Forgive Our Fathers” trail off the same way—with Broadrick’s voice, naked and human, hovering over ghostly drones and incanting the title of the track like it’s a faded memory. “Forgive Our Fathers” is particularly gorgeous; ditching his cyborg-barbarian howl halfway through, he switches to the melancholy coo of Jesu just long enough to trap and loop the song’s lingering anguish in an apocalyptic fugue. As a whole, <i>A World Lit Only by Fire </i>represents music converted into motion—kinetic and mechanical, inexorable and inhuman. Godflesh, never a forgiving band, has never sounded so relentless.</p></div>"|19896.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19896-godflesh-a-world-lit-only-by-fire/|8.0|Jason Heller

For creative and life partners Aaron Coyes and Indra Dunis, bliss really is a product of hugs, not drugs: their dubwise, synth-smudged psychedelic pop is as lyrically sentimental as it is musically ethereal, and offers proof that the hot-blooded rush of romance and the dizzying delirium of new parenthood are as potent as any chemical supplement. But in the wake of their 2012 breakthrough LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16737-lucifer/""><i>Lucifer</i></a>, Peaking Lights are now at the point where their humble recording project has become a full-fledged career, one that requires regularly breaking out of their cocoon. Given that Coyes and Dunis’ music has always pointed a kaleidoscopic lens on their personal lives, it’s only natural that their sound has changed to reflect their new reality—both the joy of interacting with larger audiences, and the anxieties that result when domestic bliss is disrupted by the demands of making a living on the road.</p>
<p>For Peaking Lights, <i>Cosmic Logic</i> heralds a dramatic aesthetic shift similar to that undertaken by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"">Animal Collective</a> on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10650-strawberry-jam/""><i>Strawberry Jam</i></a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house"">Beach House</a> on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13872-teen-dream/""><i>Teen Dream</i></a>, where a once-mystical entity emerged as an extroverted force, hardening their liquefied sound into more modular shapes, and promoting vocals from textural detail to featured attraction. And from a sonic standpoint at least, <i>Cosmic Logic</i> is a triumph, retaining the heady allure of the band’s earlier records but infusing it with enough rhythmic intricacy and fidgety energy to warrant a band-name change to Tweaking Lights. Within the album’s first three seconds, we’ve already been catapulted several galaxies beyond <i>Lucifer</i>’s subaquatic serenity: Where the beats on previous Peaking Lights albums rarely rose above a tick-tock titter, <i>Cosmic Logic</i> opener “Infinite Trips” surges forth with a thundering drum break that provides the bedrock on which Dunis’ calm coo squares off against space-bound synth oscillations and a <i>Daydream Nation</i>-esque guitar pattern.</p>
<p>The songs on <i>Cosmic Logic</i> are half as long as the ones on <i>Lucifer</i>, but equally stuffed with wondrous detail, giving these compact tracks the compressing effect of a squeezed-out toothpaste tube: “Little Light” craftily invokes both slow-motion dub drowsiness and peak-hour piano-house elation; the seemingly slumberous “Dreamquest” intensifies into a twitchy tropical funk; and “Eyes to Sea” piles on acid-house freakery until its titular incantation starts to sound like “ecstasy.” But even with the punchier, dancefloor-friendly presentation, there remains something comfortably cozy about the sound of <i>Cosmic Logic</i>—Peaking Lights may sound more eager to get crowds moving this time around, but they’d still sooner DJ a rager in your apartment living room than a superclub. </p>
<p>It’s too bad then that <i>Cosmic Logic</i>’s entrancing, otherworldly effects are diminished by some nursery-rhyme-naïve lyrics. Of course, Peaking Lights’ lyrics have never been especially deep (unless you’re referring to their traditional position in the mix). But <i>Cosmic Logic</i> forcefully flips their traditional script, placing Dunis’ voice high above the percolating productions where they were once deeply embedded within them. And, unfortunately, this can place undue emphasis on the inflexible quality of her voice and the rote, reductive nature of her words. She may be singing louder, but that doesn’t necessarily mean she’s become more emotionally expressive: “Telephone Call” (chorus: Telephone call, telephone call from space/ Calling all, calling all the human race”) feels less like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HbYScltf1c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a comment on our modern-day addiction to constant connectivity</a> than the dumbstruck observations of someone who’s just awoken from a 20-year deep sleep and handed their first iPhone. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5237-yacht/"">YACHT</a>-rockin’ “Hypnotic Hustle” and digi-reggae groover “Breakdown”, meanwhile, render the manic rhythm of daily life as a strobe-lit ballet, but Dunis’ anodyne delivery feels oddly disconnected from the tension/release described within; even when she’s issuing explicit directives for us to get down, Dunis seems to be dancing like somebody’s watching.</p>
<p>But on the late-game electro-disco workout “New Grrrls”, Dunis fully acclimatizes to her new home in spotlight, and opens up to convey something more resonant than the simple, nondescript sloganeering proffered throughout much of <i>Cosmic Logic</i>. On the surface, the song is a roll call of trailblazing female heroes—from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1763-kim-gordon"">Kim Gordon</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3161-yoko-ono/"">Yoko Ono</a> to black-power activist Angela Davis and sex educator Betty Dodson—that feels like a shout-out to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0idmTWxFs1A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">another song that was itself a series of shout-outs</a>. But it’s a necessary update, wherein Dunis tries to reconcile her radicalized riot grrl past with her seemingly more prosaic present as a parent, and finds the two are fuelled by the same ire: “Can’t stop to be just a mom/ The choice to stay at home is gone/ Worker, lover, mother, wife/ Gotta do it all in this life.” And with that line, this album’s equilibrium-upsetting aural eclecticism comes into sharp focus: even if you’re not a working mom trying to function on four hours of sleep per night, the buzzing busyness and hallucinatory disorientation of <i>Cosmic Logic</i> are liable to make you feel like one.</p></div>"|19854.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19854-peaking-lights-cosmic-logic/|6.5|Stuart Berman

The passing of the avant-garde jazz composer born Herman Blount in May of 1993 was reported in the midst of broadcasting “Whoomp! (There It Is)” and “Whoot, There It Is” videos, which seems as incongruous as if news of Captain Beefheart’s passing had merited mention during ""Jersey Shore"" commercial breaks (it didn’t). There’s still no news item that seems quite like a transmission beamed from the stars as having Kurt Loder suggest that viewers investigate Sun Ra’s extraterrestrial 1963 album, <i>Cosmic Tones for Mental Therapy</i>.</p>
<p>With over a hundred full-length albums stretching from 1956 until the early '90s, some hand-painted and self-released, Sun Ra’s recorded work is less a discography than a cosmology. Sun Ra embodied both the history of jazz as well as its future, evolving from big band swing and stride piano to space gospel and white noise blat, with live shows that embraced all of it. He's one of the 20th century's singular human beings, yet one who claimed to be an alien. Before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6208-george-clinton/"">George Clinton</a>'s mothership landed, before Cybotron and electro, before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"">Lil Wayne</a>'s croak about being a martian, Sun Ra was already floating in space. Depending on what album you investigate, though, you might imagine that Sun Ra made woozy doo-wop, shrieking paeans to Atlantis, landings on the moon, odes to Batman, future disco, ditties about the atomic bomb, or gentle versions of Disney tunes. Which is to say that there’s no exact portal into Ra’s world.</p>
<p>Spanning twenty songs across two discs, longtime Ra reedman Marshall Allen’s well-curated <i>In the Orbit of Ra</i> covers as much ground (or, rather, space) as any one set can. <i>Ra</i> alights on almost all aspects of its bandleader’s multidimensional sound and presents a coherent trajectory through it, alternating between otherworldly explorations and earthbound beats. It opens with the deft melodic turns of “Somewhere in Space”, recorded in 1958, and moves into the drum-drunk seven-minute suite “The Lady With The Golden Stockings”, recorded just two years on.</p>
<p>Those heavy drums and crystalline melodies meld with two of Sun Ra’s more familiar instruments, his electric piano and the space chants of his longtime vocalist June Tyson, on “Somebody Else’s World.” Swift figures of upright bass, drums, bells and twinkling celeste power “Angels And Demons At Play”, creating the sort of winsome miniatures that are reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a> at his most gentle (“Flim” and “Nannou” in particular). The jittery piano figure and afterburner chording of “Rocket Number Nine Take Off for the Planet Venus” might be Sun Ra’s biggest “hit”, a swinging hard bop number that soon opens up to allow room for his triumvirate of reedmen John Gilmore, Pat Patrick, and Marshall Allen to take extended solos, as well as bassist Ronnie Boykins' quiet yet mesmeric solo that hints at the galaxy surrounding, before the ensemble convenes again to chant in unison: “Second stop at Jupiter!” like interplanetary bus drivers.</p>
<p>The second disc dives into Sun Ra’s more outré fare, balancing it with more classic jazz numbers. “Astro Black”, the ten-minute suite from his 1973 album of the same name, sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14299-duke-ellington/"">Duke Ellington</a>’s jungle music shot into deepest space. “Astro Black Mythology/ Astro Timeless Immortality/ Astro Thought in Mystic Sound” June Tyson intones like a saleslady from Outer Spaceways Incorporated, the growls of saxophones now react to the radiation emitted from Sun Ra’s prototype synthesizers, which whirr and bleep like malfunctioning satellites. For a taste of Sun Ra’s influence on electronic dance music and minimal techno of all stripes, there’s the dizzying eleven-minute pulsars of “Dance of the Cosmo Aliens.”</p>
<p>While the shrieks, squalls, and space junk noise was what initially drew me to Sun Ra’s music as a teenager, as the years have passed, I now find myself revisiting the twinkling polyrhythmic pieces that comprise the last half of the second disc, highlighted by numbers like “The Nile” and “Planet Earth.” That in the late '80s Sun Ra and His Arkestra would offer up a charming cover of “Pink Elephants On Parade”, from <i>Dumbo</i>, shows the latent childlike wonder coursing through his vast catalog. </p>
<p>But Ra’s music is a mixture of open-eared innocence as well as the darkest blues. Those space chants are but field hollers transported to outer space, far from the world of deeply-embittered segregation he lived through in America. He posited himself as an alien life form so as to embody his sense of estrangement here on Earth. “This world is strange to me,” he sings on the piano ballad “Trying to Put the Blame On Me.” “I feel alone/ so all alone/ like a different kind of being.”</p></div>"|19736.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19736-sun-ra-and-his-arkestra-in-the-orbit-of-ra/|8.8|Andy Beta

In real life, Korvette (real name: Kosloff) is an office worker who holds down a <a href=""http://www.guernicamag.com/daily/sex-death/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“corporate insurance gig”</a>; in Pissed Jeans, he assumes the name of a sports car and fronts a viciously dissonant punk rock band that’s signed to Sub Pop, torchbearers of the squirming, misanthropic sludge that Sub Pop once symbolized. Korvette switches between these two guises when the situation calls for it, ready at the crank of an amp to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5iIYuz_bME"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">transform</a> into some kind of writhing, grunt-spewing superhero. Call him The Juggler. </p>
<p>Korvette’s uncanny superpower—to turn the drudgery of everyday life into the stuff of absurdist theater—has become honed over the years, but it was already strong on Pissed Jeans' first album, <i>Shallow</i>. Released in 2005 on the tiny label Parts Unknown and long out of print, it’s getting reissued by Sub Pop with the inclusion of two bonus tracks, “Throbbing Organ” and “Night Minutes”, drawn from their debut 7” in 2004. Those two songs don’t hold a candle to <i>Shallow</i>’s gut-shuddering power; the fidelity is thin to the point of flimsiness, and guitarist Bradley Fry had yet to fully harness his neck-wringing attack. Mostly, though, Korvette hangs in the background, yelping unintelligibly over two tracks that sound a lot like each other: splashes of asphalt gray and muddy brown that fall somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22521-the-birthday-party/"">the Birthday Party</a>’s puked-up blues and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2187-the-jesus-lizard/"">the Jesus Lizard</a>’s punch-drunk nut-thrusting.</p>
<p>Pissed Jeans’ black-eyed view of punk doesn’t brighten on <i>Shallow</i>—it just comes into focus. On “Ugly Twin (I’ve Got)”, Korvette projects his self-loathing onto a doppelganger; Fry’s riffs buckle under the combined weight of that ingrown hatred, grinding along at a snail’s pace and punctuated by scrambled, Greg Ginn-esque licks. That punch-the-mirror repugnance at one’s own navel-gazing existence takes a darkly comic turn on “Ashamed of My Cum”. Gnawing at his own syllables with all the puzzled-panther ferocity of Darby Crash, Korvette blurs and slurs his masturbatory confessional in an aptly orgasmic yowl of agony. </p>
<p>The shit hits the ceiling in “Boring Girls”. Hacking up hairballs through a face full of Novocain—yet somehow clinging to a hook—Korvette screeches and mumbles about “Oh, I want to kiss those boring girls” while the rest of the band desperately drones. A change seems imminent, but it never comes; instead, the song plunks away at the same nerve-deadening, G-sharp power chord, unsatisfying and unresolved, until it becomes a featureless smear of whatever the opposite of sex is. When the guitar drops out for a verse to leave a gaping absence of noise, the anticlimax is nauseating. Pissed Jeans wrote a so-boring-it’s-fascinating anthem to honor all the so-boring-they’re-fascinating objects of their creepy fixation, which is disgusting and also hilariously perfect.</p>
<p>If there’s an early Sub Pop band that Pissed Jeans are the spiritual heirs to, it’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2860-mudhoney/"">Mudhoney</a>. The two groups sound little alike, but Korvette and crew have revamped Mudhoney’s slop-trawling skronk for a new millennium—and nowhere is that more evident than on <i>Shallow</i>’s first track, “I’m Sick”. While not on par with Mudhoney’s 1988 debut single, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nGsT_qFMBs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Touch Me I’m Sick”</a>, the song is Pissed Jeans’ opening shot, a bratty stab at infamy that perversely celebrates their own hopeless prognosis. “I’m dehydrated/ I’ve got diarrhea/ I can’t keep my food down/ My sinuses are clogged,” Korvette whines violently, and he makes damn sure he sounds like all four of these symptoms, plus more, are afflicting him as the tape rolls. There’s no cure in sight, and no punch line. A year before Twitter came into being, Korvette was already stringing together annoying, myopic tweets about how he feels like shit, then brazenly pretending they’re worthy of an audience. Between that and all the other examples of deadpan, documentarian tedium to be found on <i>Shallow</i>, a strange thing happens: Korvette stops his juggling and <i>does</i> sound like he’s singing from the heart. Only he may not actually be singing, and that may not actually be his heart.</p></div>"|19669.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19669-pissed-jeans-shallow/|7.8|Jason Heller

Not only did the superstar write the word SLAVE on his face, he also changed his name to an unpronounceable logo that was quickly translated into English as “The Artist Formerly Known As…” Unhappy with faltering sales in the new decade, he tried to release a quick slew of albums in order to get out of his contract, but Warner insisted on waiting the industry-standard two years between major releases. It must have felt like a demotion after Prince more or less owned the 1980s, a decade when even a flop like <i>Under the Cherry Moon</i> could spin off a hit album like <i>Parade</i>. Despite his complaints, however, Prince never regained his former popularity following his departure from Warner; as he struggled to go his own way and keep up with trends he was no longer setting, his independent output quickly grew prodigious and preeningly self-indulgent, ranging from the triple-disc <i>Emancipation </i>in 1996 to the soggy <i>The Rainbow Children</i> in 2001 to the one-two punch of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12911-lotusflow3r-mplsound-elixer/"">MPLSound and LotusFlow3r</a></i> in 2009. </p>
<p>What’s most surprising about Prince re-signing (or resigning?) with Warner Brothers nearly twenty years later is just how much sense it makes for both parties. The label has welcomed one of its signature stars back to the fold, who brings his never-reissued/never-remastered back catalog with him. They’ve already teased a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54836-prince-reissuing-purple-rain-promises-new-music-under-new-warner-bros-deal/"">new edition</a> of <i>Purple Rain</i>—the dream we all dream of—and Prince gets some major-label backing at a time when he seems creatively rejuvenated and newly focused. A string of startlingly solid singles led to <i>Art Official Age</i>, which despite its ludicrous title, is the most engaged Prince has sounded in a long while. In particular, “Breakfast Can Wait” is an AM lovemaking jam that schools <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2385-r-kelly/"">R. Kelly</a> with its old-school slink and Prince in supreme pillowtalk mode (“Come here baby, let me put you on my plate”).</p>
<p>Musically, <i>Art Official Age </i>is all over the map—gloriously so, in fact—as though Prince is trying to cram a triple album into a single disc. Opener “Art Official Cage” cribs directly from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a>’s more arena-ready moments, building a post-disco banger on some <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29395-nile-rodgers/"">Nile Rodgers</a>-style rhythm guitar. It sounds perhaps too familiar, but the song mimics its source with aplomb and what sounds like Princely arrogance. Cockiness has always looked better on Prince than assless chaps or satin frocks, and the song has a feisty energy that even a new jack swing rap can’t derail. Some of the best songs here are slow jams, like the wishful “This Could Be Us” and “Breakdown”, which sounds like one of the most personally revealing tunes Prince has ever recorded: “Waking up in places that you would never believe,” he sings with what sounds like deep regret. “Give me back the time, you can keep the memories.” As the strings lift the song out of the depths and laserbeams fire at the edges of the music, Prince launches into some vocal contortions that prove his voice has lost none of its wild mutability over the years. It’s the rare moment of true gravity on an album that sounds like Prince actually had a lot of fun making.</p>
<p>There’s something reassuring about such good spirits coming from him, as it recalls a much younger Prince whose mischievous smile and eye rolls conveyed a self-possession and self-awareness. On the other hand, the few times he nods to an overarching funk/sci-fi mythology—something about being cryogenically frozen for 50 years and waking up in a society with no first-person pronouns—Prince comes across as a grouchy old guy. “Twenty-four karat hashtag, put your phone in your bag,” he raps on “The Gold Standard”, sounding too much like a man in his mid-50s.</p>
<p><i>Art Official Age</i> is not a return to form by any means, but a modestly exciting Prince album. That’s certainly more than we could expect in 2014, and it’s certainly more than we get out of <i>PlectrumElectrum</i>. Prince recorded the album with his all-female backing band 3rdEyeGirl, which includes drummer Hannah Ford Welton, guitarist Donna Grantis, and bassist Ida Nielsen. All have backgrounds and even degrees in rock and jazz, so it’s obvious they have immense chops. The rhythm section lock down the grooves on the punk-/surf-rock “Marz” and the strutting “Stopthistrain”, and Grantis (formerly a member of the New Power Generation) riffs and solos on “Anotherlove” with Princely abandon.</p>
<p>What they don’t have is much of a personality. Recorded live in the studio using analog equipment,<i> </i>the album is nevertheless too proficient, too slick, and too professional to come across as much more than anonymous. They show little of the kinky inventiveness of the Revolution or the innate versatility of the New Power Generation; instead, <i>Plectrum</i> is crammed with predictable rap-rock riffs, vague alt-rock menance, and bloozy showboating. Especially blasting from Paisley Park, this is a perversely unimaginative and restrictive idea of rock‘n’roll, with none of the musical freedom that Prince has traditionally shown. One of the great pop synthesists, he has blended so many different styles and sounds so fluidly that his best music sounded positively utopian: a world without charts or genres, release schedules, or label contracts.</p>
<p>Prince and 3rdEyeGirl have good intentions, of course, and at times the album sounds like a rebuttal to the pesky rock-is-dead palaver that so many of the form’s aging practitioners have memorized. “A girl with a guitar is 12 times better than another crazy band o’ boys,” Prince asserts on “Fixurlifeup”. But he’s decrying prefab pop groups while backed by a prefab pop group, preaching female empowerment while playing up the novelty of an all-female band. Both of these albums sound slightly out of time, but at least <i>Art Official Age</i>, despite its flaws, has the bravado to imagine how the pop music of the future might function. By contrast, <i>Plectrum</i> merely duplicates the sounds and politics of rock ‘n’ roll’s stodgy past. </p></div>"|19900.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19900-prince-3rdeyegirl-art-official-ageplectrumelectrum/|6.5|Stephen M.

Though both rappers roots’ orginate in the variegated modern Atlanta rap scene, Quan is a rapper who rides the beat like Adrien Broner rides a speedbag, while the shape-shifting Thug is brilliant—future-sounding in the sense that no one on earth sounds like Young Thug—but unquantifiable. Though they’ve already got one totally great, totally anthemic single together, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGt_JGHYEO4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">”Lifestyle”</a>,  there was no guarantee that the arrangement would hold up over 20 songs that feature little else but Thug, Quan, and occasionally <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12128-birdman/"">Birdman</a>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Luckily, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EA1gh8XKGk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Daddy knows best</a>, and <i>Tha Tour Part 1</i> is one of the year’s best tapes, a tape that exudes the electric chemistry between Young Thug and Rich Homie Quan for the great majority of its runtime. Though Rich Homie can play the role of a bruiser, he has a deft ear for melody, and the points where he locks in harmonically with Thug—”Tell Em (Lies)” is perhaps the best example—feel magical. Given that his counterpart is wont to do his own thing, Quan finds a way to match him stride for stride and Quan’s versatility leads to a number of standout features.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Thug, for his part, is coming off a string of loose hits that showcase just how much good will has buoyed the young, strange Atlantan whose swag is best described as “singular.” Bouncing off of Quan on <i>Tha Tour Part 1</i>, that groundswell of goodwill feels like a tidal wave, a rush that takes you to a new plateau for both artists, and especially for Thug. Most of Young Thug’s releases to this point have a good number of songs that feel unfinished, or sound like sketches that haven’t quite found their true form. Thanks to some <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/naomizeichner/young-thug-trapped-major-label-deal"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">truly confusing label drama</a>, finding out when, where, or how a given Young Thug song was recorded is a confounding task. With respect to his breakout tape <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17891-young-thug-1017-thug/"">1017 Thug</a></i>, then, Thug’s approach has never been as polished and effective as it sounds on <i>Tha Tour Part 1</i>. Even though it’s still tough to figure out what Thug is talking about—”CREW CUT! CREW CUT!” he yells on “Flava”, about his preferred t-shirt style—never has his Vine-loop flow sounded so awesome.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This is 84 minutes of mixtape-rapping released by two dudes who have lucrative label deals in place, so naturally, there’s points where this release drags. Songs like “Throw Your Hood Up” dribble past the five-minute mark and come across as like experiments with delivery (“Scabies on your babiieeessss,” sings Thug), but when they strike the balance—”730”, “Tell Em (Lies)”, “Givenchy”, “I Know It”—it’s the stuff of vivid dreams. Operating over London on da Track’s bed of snappy, energetic-but-slightly-warped trap, Quan and Thug are basically the Larry Johnson/Priest Holmes backfield of rap, and they know it.</p>
<p>Birdman’s involvement on <i>Tha Tour Part 1</i> is comparatively spare but serves an important purpose—to stamp the two latest stars of his stable with his invaluable seal. Young Thug is making the music that many imagined Lil Wayne could make, and it makes perfect sense that Birdman has thrown his weight behind what is probably the best free mixtape offered for download in 2014.</p></div>"|19901.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19901-birdman-young-thug-rich-homie-quan-tha-tour-part-1/|8.0|Corban Goble

And why is one called <a href=""http://adhoc.fm/post/interview-pc-worships-filthiest-tapehead-justin-fr/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""the shitar""</a>? PC Worship is, in essence, a twisted, low-pitched vision of subterranean psychedelia—variously made of bad-moon-lit trash-punk, droning minimalism, prepared pianos, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/184-albert-ayler/"" target=""_blank"">Albert Ayler</a>-worshipping sax freak-outs—as imagined by one Justin Frye, who handled vocals, guitars, tape manipulations, and keys as the writer, recorder, and producer of this latest behemoth, <i>Social Rust</i>. Frye has played back-up for experimental synth-cyborg <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29301-gary-war/"" target=""_blank"">Gary War</a> as well as Baltimore weirdos Teeth Mountain, both of which offer only a surface idea of PC Worship's frayed, pummeling avant-gardism. The questions have no direct answers—though who would want them?</p>
<p><i>Social Rust</i> sees PC Worship evolving into their most realized semblance of a ""rock band"" yet, collaging decades of downtown New York dissonance while sludging into the future. Along with Frye, the core group is guitarist Michael Etten (also credited for ""sax?"" parts), bassist Jordan Bernstein of <a href=""http://thedreebs.bandcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Dreebs</a>, and drummer Shannon Sigley, as well as numerous contributors of backwards violin lines learned from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/649-john-cale/"" target=""_blank"">John Cale</a>, homemade noise generators, circuit-bent tape players, creative piano solos (in other words, running one's hand across the keys lawlessly), bass clarinet, and organ. Frye, along with another PC guy named ""Bongo Dan"" (credited here for adding percussive flourishes ""on something, somewhere""), have both worked at NYC museum <a href=""http://momaps1.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MoMA PS1</a>—and perhaps they took notes on the cut-and-paste junk sculptures by contemporary artists who carry Dada forward. PC Worship's adventurous style of art-punk is spiritually not dissimilar to that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/521-butthole-surfers/"" target=""_blank"">Butthole Surfers</a>, though it seems more interesting to draw connections to PC's peers: Andrew Savage, of studious New York traditionalists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30832-parquet-courts/"" target=""_blank"">Parquet Courts</a>, is co-releasing<i> Rust </i>on his label, <a href=""http://dulltools.bigcartel.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dull Tools</a>, and the two bands just announced that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56590-parquet-courts-share-bodies-video-form-supergroup-pcpc-with-pc-worship-tour/"" target=""_blank"">a supergroup called PCPC</a> will tour with a godfather of similarly Beat-obsessed bohemian punk-noise, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3874-thurston-moore/"" target=""_blank"">Thurston Moore</a>.</p>
<p>PC Worship's journey from tin-can-recorded live jams of squalling feedback, free jazz exploration, and meditative cello to the more formally-realized <i>Social Rust</i> is not unexpected—as early as 2010's <i>Millenial Kreephaus </i>tape on <a href=""http://raccoo-oo-oon.org/np/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Night-People</a>, they've incorporated heavier punk riffs and conventional drum/vocal structures, despite the tendencies for crackling radio hiss and a gurgling, ghostly, cinematic distance. The organization of sound has been gradual over 2011's <i>Dread Head</i>, 2012's <i>Toxic Love</i>, and 2013's <i>Beat Punk</i>, the ideas all crystallizing to a hyper-present maelstrom on <i>Social Rust</i>. The music of PC Worship's past pulled and pinched at your brain, requiring patience, and now it is more immediate, but no less weird. Instead of collapsing into one another, ideas are given proper canvases.</p>
<p><i>Social Rust</i> is a masterful act of trickery. The first half works through PC Worship's most accessible material to date—""Odd"" and ""Behind the Picture"" have heavy, visceral, hummable grooves with valleys and explosive swells. The hooks have a throbbing backbone; you could do a stoned headbang to them. ""I'm feeling <i>odd</i>,"" Frye and co. sing, in unison, over—relatively speaking—a thick, soaring grunge riff. The layered vocals are possessed by an otherness in their deranged multiplicity. ""Odd"" opens with caterwauling, terrifying shrieks, which sound ripped from a horror film, and most of the song glides through a calmly sinister, low-tone poem: ""Smoke dripping, heat seaking, dust breathing."" ""Picture"" features a peculiar tempo change at its midpoint, racing off to an endless, kraut-shaped contortion. A lit, dragged cigarette opens the air-tight, claustrophobic highlight, ""Rust"", which dirges with monotone, free-associating lyrics, capturing all of PC Worship's best ideas in four minutes. (Amusingly, ""Rust"" features a hypnotizing swarm of atonal violin drones by the Dreebs' Adam Markiewicz, who—on the other side of the dim-lit New York spectrum—also put down some of the sophisticated strings on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32442-mr-twin-sister/"" target=""_blank"">Mr Twin Sister</a>'s recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19799-mr-twin-sister-mr-twin-sister/"" target=""_blank"">clubby, cosmpolitan night-crawl</a>.)</p>
<p>The mystical tape mutation of ""Gypsy"" opens with a creepy cackle, before summoning clouds of patchouli-scented incense smoke, and it paces <i>Social Rust</i> for the dusty strummer, ""Baby in the Backroom"". ""I look at everybody and think about hell/ I wonder if hell's bad?"" Frye subtly taunts over his most directly pleasing, wearied, and clear-sounding chorus, which still sounds like it ought to be blaring from a shitty boombox. And just then, this melodious side of <i>Rust</i> ducks out: a 44-second attack clears the way for a heavily-saturated closing trio of monolithic exercises in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a>-like endurance, ecstasy, venom, and dread. PC Worship ease listeners in with hooks, then whip them to a pulp. </p>
<p>There's always humor in purposefully derailing a conventionally good thing, especially when it comes by way of quaking no-wave monsters. As such, PC Worship are committed to their ideas—or the perpetual destruction and rebirth of them—but they do not take themselves too seriously. When I saw them last, at the soon-defunct Williamsburg venue <a href=""http://deathbyaudio.net"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Death by Audio</a>, cymbals were pushed over, pointillist sax blurts were mixed with manic cassette fuckery, and an acoustic guitar with at least one broken string was ""prepared"" using a crushed plastic cup.</p>
<p>Among PC Worship's dizzying smatter of <a href=""http://www.pcworship.blogspot.com/p/discography-contact-info.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tapes and CD-Rs</a>, <i>Social Rust</i> appears to be their fifth LP, but who knows? Their prolificacy seems intended to confuse. PC Worship are analog rock eccentrics who visibly enjoy skewing information—even <a href=""http://www.pcworship.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">basic details on their website</a> can take the form of abstracted poetry, and it wouldn't be surprising if they secretly released a whole unknown album on VHS tape with carrier-pigeon distribution. For a band so keen on obfuscation, the notion of making complex musical ideas more palatable isn't just an aesthetic shift, but also an ideological one. Nonetheless, <i>Social Rust</i> proves that real experimentation does not require impenetrability at every turn. Referencing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2725-meat-puppets"">Meat Puppets</a>, Frye writes in the credits, ""I bought <i>Too High to Die</i> on CD from a thrift store and listened to it while I drove across the desert, then someone spilled Cherry Coke on it, which dried, sticky to the CD and I frisbeed it into a thunderstorm sunset outside of Phoenix."" Music is everywhere, and the expanses are chaotic, and understanding the cocophony of sound (and life) is futile. Now, though, freaks of all-ages and places can hear <i>Social Rust</i> and feel that giddy sense of hope crawling in their skin—these out-sounds are being twisted from someplace new.</p></div>"|19845.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19845-pc-worship-social-rust/|7.8|Jenn Pelly

While that's debatable, it doesn't feel hyperbolic, which says as much as needs saying about James' uncanny technical talents: he is a precision singer nonpareil, bold and subtle, with a tender falsetto that sustains muscular force even at the top of its register. It was this earnest, vigorous power and proficiency that defined ""I Want You,"" the breakout from the 2011 mixtape <i>#Luke, </i>which also appears on his latest, self-titled album. The song would receive a Grammy nomination for Best R&amp;B Performance, propelling a behind-the-scenes talent without an album into competition with long-established stars. (It lost to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10008-usher/"">Usher</a>'s ""Climax,"" which is, granted, one of the decade's best records point blank.) </p>
<p class=""p1"">30-year-old James is no industry novice; he attended high school with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"">Frank Ocean</a> in New Orleans where he formed an R&amp;B group called Upskale in the late '90s. He soon moved to Los Angeles to pursue music, formed a duo called Luke &amp; Q, and after a few false starts (and an appearance in the video for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1067-destinys-child/"">Destiny's Child</a>'s ""Soldier"") linked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"">Timbaland</a> protégé Danja. After penning records for Chris Brown (""Crawl,"" his biggest hit, was co-written with Magic!""s Nasri Atweh), Justin Bieber, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6916-britney-spears/"">Britney Spears</a>, he embarked on a solo career in 2011. After releasing two mixtapes (<i>#Luke</i> and the 2012 tape <i>Whispers in the Dark</i>), several singles (the  pristine ""I.O.U."", from 2013), and touring the world as an opener for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a>, Luke, who now lives in Harlem, has released his official debut. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Luke James</i> exists in its own universe, paying little heed to the sound of contemporary hip-hop or R&amp;B. Although <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"">Rick Ross</a> nabs a guest verse on ""Options"", a tempestuous anthem of desperation, <i>Luke James</i> is otherwise a traditional vocal-driven R&amp;B record, a style unexpectedly off-trend in 2014. In this sense, it stands with the work of artists like Jazmine Sullivan, whose old soul backings are primarily used in the service of tight-as-a-drum songwriting and singing that takes center stage. Although traditional, James' sound isn't as retro as Sullivan's tends to be: at his best, with ballads and mid-tempo explorations of passion and heartbreak, his art is the nexus of nuanced interpretation, personality, a tireless wellspring of emotion, and the virtuosic control which channels that emotion to breathtaking effect. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Not that every song stands outside of time, though—James just has little interest in the late-'90s pop-R&amp;B fixation of current R&amp;B, nor in the dusty textures and breakbeats of whatever remains of neo-soul. Occasionally, his songs do look to the 1980s; the layered, percussive rhythms of ""Dancing in the Dark"" suggest the worldbeat-inflected pop sound of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson"">Michael Jackson</a>'s ""Liberian Girl"" or Toto, and ""Expose"" is a fun retro-funk closer that would feel at home on a wedding dancefloor. But the album's sonic canvas is mostly unobtrusive: heavy drums are present throughout, and instrumentation will ramp up intensity to match a song's natural climax. But by and large, the backdrop complements James' own cultivation of emotion.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The stakes are set through his singing and songwriting, in part through the transitive properties of James' formidable voice, which proves a thrilling listen: his intense vocals swoop in to lock on one note, only to glide gracefully to the next, a feather caught in the breeze. The album is bold in some ways and hedged in others: It relies wholly on James' singing and songwriting to attract its audience, gleefully shedding the trend-hopping fans eager to conscript outsider narratives of authenticity. The rough vocal styles of the been-through-it-all soul singer, the lurid details of the afterparty's afterparty, the angles that would present him more accessibly to a male audience, are irrelevant here. While James' singing is uncompromised, <i>Luke James</i> feels safer: a collection of powerhouse emotions, it's stylistically noncommittal, beyond its recognition of James' otherworldly talents. An overarching vision, or some kind of formal framework, would be welcome.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Nonetheless, there isn't a weak song on the record. And although long considered out of fashion by the music press (just search the critical history for references to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10697-mariah-carey/"">Mariah Carey</a>'s ""melisma""), technical prowess like James' is a feature, not a bug, particularly in his moving ballads. As atmosphere has overtaken performance as a central value in popular R&amp;B, a charismatic star like Luke James is a refreshing anomaly. <i>Luke James</i> may not be a crossover smash for the singer, but it sets the table for a career with unlimited potential.</p></div>"|19895.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19895-luke-james-luke-james/|7.7|David Drake

Ramalepe, who produces as DJ Spoko, has wrapped himself in a style he calls Bacardi House, a frenetic amalgamation—named after the rum popular amongst his fans—of house music, kwaito (a South African hip hop variant), and Shangaan electro. <i>War God</i>, which follows the <i>Ghost Town</i> EP on True Panther, is his first album available in the West, a 20-track tour of Ramalepe's distinct, tireless style.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>War God</i> wastes no time introducing itself. There are no intros and outros in Bacardi House, only snares and synths, a torrent of which course through nearly every track on <i>War God</i>. It's a style defined by short, staccato attacks, countless pricks of drums, a steady drizzle of fake horns, fake flutes, and fake keys. This is music imagined and created on a computer, defined by its replicability, its acclimation to headphones and laptop speakers.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The kick drum—deployed in a metronomic four-on-the-floor pattern as often as not—isn't optimized for the big room soundsystems of Europe. Mixed low, it doesn't pin the track down so much as provide a loose structure for Ramalepe's spicular melodies. The tracks, and the snares especially, tend to be mixed dry—with little reverb—lending them presence and urgency. As such, there is no escaping <i>War God</i>, no balling yourself up in its repetitions, no zoning out to an endless succession of barely changing beats. This is poised, almost bitterly attendant music, music that refuses to retreat into the background.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The sounds, which are mostly synthesized, vary between traditional synthesized elements of house and techno (see the lazer-drop kick sounds of ""Bula Ma"") and sounds meant to emulate the woody marimbas and prickly kalimbas more often heard in South African music. The scales scan as distinctly non-western, even as the kick drum offers its familiar concussions. There are few sustained notes on <i>War God</i>, and certainly nothing as somnambulant and passive as a pad; each track is a cluster of notes, most with enough softness and give to prevent the track from becoming too percussive, but nonetheless swift enough to prevent relaxation or stasis.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The material on <i>War God</i> is less alien than the dance styles presented on compilations like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14532-shangaan-electro-new-wave-dance-music-from-south-africa/"">Shangaan Electro</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4596-congotronics/"">Congotronics</a>, two other African electronic musics that have been embraced by fringe Western audiences. Less isolated and singular, Ramalepe's productions feel akin to Lisbon's <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/principepromos"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Principe Discos</a> label—itself music birthed by the African diaspora—conversant in the familiar styles of house music (Principe's DJ Marfox recently released an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16930-beat-and-break/"">EP</a> on Lit City Trax).</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>War God</i> spans 20 tracks and more than 85 minutes. As an immersion experience—a gateway into Ramalepe's harried visions—it's fine. As an album, it falters, gasping for air as Ramalepe offers up yet another four-minute bushel of bobbing tones. Ramalepe rarely employs recognizable samples (outside of percussion, perhaps) and only one track—the heated ""Oreng Mo"", featuring DJ Mujava—employs a vocalist. <i>War God</i>, as a result, feels mournful and uninhabited. Rarely does music this busy also sound this lonesome. At times, it's difficult to imagine these tracks in a mix with anything but themselves. <i>War God</i>'s form—a twist on house music—is recognizable, but its atmosphere often feels otherworldly, like Ramalepe has followed the bare minimum number of rules to qualify as modern dance music.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And that's great, even if the material on <i>War God</i> never fully congeals into an album. <i>War God</i> is the product of someone immersed in a singular world; it is necessarily limited, and Ramalepe has a lot less to learn from the average house producer than the average house producer has to learn from him. <i>War God</i> is vital, transfixing music that demands your attention, and the onus is on you to figure out what to do when it does grab it.</p></div>"|19888.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19888-dj-spoko-war-god/|7.1|Andrew Gaerig

Midway through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4568-weezer/"">Weezer</a>’s ninth studio LP, he airs his grievances on a song called, not coincidentally, “I’ve Had It Up to Here”—the most valid of which is that people think he’s somehow insincere. You could describe Weezer’s 21st century output in many derogatory ways and most of it would be warranted, but “dishonest” isn’t one of them. Pick anything he’s done over the past 15 years and ask yourself, “What label exec concerned with the bottom line would possibly cosign <i>this</i>?” Rivers Cuomo is making the exact kind of music he wants to make—it just so happens that it sounds like music for the masses and has no currency whatsoever. Yet, in his finest mock-operatic metal voice, Cuomo brings “I’ve Had It Up to Here” to a head with, “If you think I need approval from the faceless throng/ Well, that's where you’re wrong.” The important word here is “faceless.” Cuomo does seek approval, but on <i>Everything Will Be Alright in the End</i>, he realizes that he needs it from a familiar source that he knows quite well: people who may have once been Weezer fans.</p>
<p>That said, you’ll have to give the overt apology “Back to the Shack” a second chance, and I realize that’s a tall order<span>—</span>if recent Weezer has ever driven you to punch a total stranger, this one leads with the chin. There's Cuomo’s tendency to treat <i>The Blue Album</i>’s goodwill as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8611-weezer-green-album/"">renewable</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11568-weezer-the-red-album/"">resource</a>, the lyrics peppered with meta references about Weezer’s past<span>—</span>namely, his lightning bolt guitar strap and that <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl_gCRfaaRw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one time he let drummer Patrick Wilson sing lead</a>. You might roll your eyes when he rhymes “rockin’ out like it’s ‘94” with “more hardcore,” and they will bug out when revisiting 1994 somehow means doing fourth-wall rhyme-bustin’ that was perfected on “El Scorcho” and responsible for “Beverly Hills”. And then there are the wincing, “What year is this?” jokes that will certainly be criticized for “lolz rockism”<span>: </span>taking himself to task because “I forgot that disco sucks,” thinking that the radio and “those stupid singing shows” are even in competition anymore, or that they had any effect on Weezer.</p>
<p>But something about this song sticks, and it’s not just the hook, though that’s a big part of it—even those who despise Weezer can admit Cuomo has an inexhaustible, infuriating ability to write melodies that lodge themselves in your brain after one listen, whether you want it there or not. During the second verse, Cuomo drops the yuks and sings, “I finally settled down with my girl and I made up with my dad.” He could not be more direct about what “Back to the Shack” truly means beyond its reprise of “Pork and Beans”'s message about being true to one’s self: those represent the twin engines that powered <i>The Blue Album</i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14817-pinkerton-deluxe-edition-death-to-false-metal/"">Pinkerton</a></i>’s emotional train wrecks, and there's the possibility that “Back to the Shack” might be a sly, sarcastic rebuke against armchair producers and YouTube commenters, a la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"">Danny Brown</a>’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18565-danny-brown-old"">Old</a></i>: you don’t want the old Rivers Cuomo, so do you want him to rock out like it’s ‘94 or do you just want him to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okthJIVbi6g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sing about it and make a record of his (broken) heart</a>?</p>
<p>Because you’re only getting one in 2014, and <i>Everything</i> does occasionally rock out with the same joyous abandon of <i>The Blue Album</i>, albeit without its wide-eyed naivety. If you really want to go out on a limb, this is as close as Cuomo is getting to his own version of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18860-sun-kil-moon-benji"">Benji</a></i><span>—</span>a rock lifer moving forward by clearing out his past, the songs almost entirely dedicated to his relationships with his career, women, and his parents. “Cleopatra” and “Foolish Father” have subjects that are pulled right from Cuomo’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16152-alone-iii-the-pinkerton-years/"">mid-'90s diaries</a><span>—</span>namely, powerful women who frighten and leave Rivers Cuomo, and absentee fathers. Twenty years later, the lesson here is the futility of hating someone who likely did their best, to forgive them and to forgive yourself.</p>
<p>That part resonates, as does the lived-in wisdom applicable to the songs that are about being in Weezer, even when they sorta aren’t. The generality of “Eulogy for a Rock Band” actually works in its favor when you consider it could very well be about rock music itself (for cryin’ out loud, <a href=""http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/gene-simmons-future-of-rock"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cuomo’s favorite rock group just declared rock dead</a>). Meanwhile, the platitudes of “Ain’t Got Nobody” give way to a startling, lucid account of Cuomo’s abandonment issues that have spanned his entire life, from childhood to confused, needy rock stardom<span>: </span>“My daddy loved me/ No one could touch me/ Until he went up and left me lonely/ That’s human nature/ We fail each other/ And keep on searching for another.”</p>
<p>Of course, Cuomo ensures that you don’t have to read that far into <i>Everything Will Be Alright in the End</i>, keeping the melodies up front and the gimmicks mostly in his notebook. The effect of <i>Blue Album</i> producer Ric Ocasek will likely be overstated: the lyrics on any previous Weezer album were not the producer’s fault, and from all accounts, the guitar tones and keyboards on that record were all Cuomo’s idea anyways. Either way, these are simple, effective songs that will settle for constant rotation in your head if MTV’s not an option: “Lonely Girl” isolates the second verse of “Only in Dreams” and reworks <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18138-scott-rivers-scott-rivers/"">Cuomo’s Japanese curio “Homely Girl”</a> into a legitimate buzzy throwback. Meanwhile, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28196-best-coast"">Best Coast</a>’s Bethany Cosentino<span>—</span>no stranger to criticisms about elementary-school lyricism and stunted relationship dynamics<span>—</span>lends guest vocals to “Go Away”, which is a decent song but an even more important pledge of allegiance.</p>
<p>Heck, even the confounding decisions and filler that inextricably form latter-day Weezer albums are kinda charming. The whistle-core of “Da Vinci” will probably be the only way you’ll remember that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29788-foster-the-people/"">Foster the People</a> made a record this year. Meanwhile, the closing, mostly instrumental “The Futurescope Trilogy” probably belongs on Cuomo's unreleased space odyssey <i><a href=""http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/rftmusic/2012/09/weezer_songs_from_the_black_hole_listen_release.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Songs From the Black Hole</a></i> and doesn’t stack up to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPZCGleqh7M"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)”</a>, the batshit piece of musical theater that proved Cuomo can set new positive benchmarks for himself in the 21st century.</p>
<p><i>Everything Will Be Alright in the End</i> doesn’t set a new benchmark for Weezer, but hopefully it can go lengths to ridding them of the ridiculously unfair catch-22 they’ve faced. The past couple of weeks have seen a surprise <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4823-thom-yorke/"">Thom Yorke</a> album dropped on BitTorrent, the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin"">Aphex Twin</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19755-aphex-twin-syro/"">record</a> since 2001, and a lavish reissue of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3838-the-smashing-pumpkins/"">Smashing Pumpkins</a>’ <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19684-the-smashing-pumpkins-adore"">Adore</a></i>, and almost none of them were subject to the kind of truly wacked-out, incomprehensible standards given to Weezer’s ninth album. Granted, Rivers Cuomo hasn’t done himself many favors, as his music has been marked by refusal to evolve in the slightest either emotionally or sonically. Even still, why couldn’t Cuomo just do this in peace? Because even though <i>Weezer</i> and <i>Pinkerton</i> were never embraced by critics in real time, they sure seem to have been embraced by a lot of people who <i>grew up</i> to be critics, who in turn have relished every opportunity to bash Weezer albums as a way of separating themselves from an embarrassing part of their lives where the perspective of “No One Else” and “Pink Triangle” felt like the truth.  </p>
<p>There have been many ways to qualify praise for Weezer and with each successive listen, <i>Everything Will Be Alright in the End</i> certainly earns the typically backhanded compliments: “actually not terrible,” “certainly better than <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14652-hurley/"">Hurley</a></i>,” “probably their best since...<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8613-maladroit/"">Maladroit</a></i>, that was good right?” Or, <i>Everything</i> could be accepted for what it is and be held to a more manageable standard: how good does a Weezer album have to be before it can be considered <i>actually</i> good?  As it turns out, about this good.</p></div>"|19830.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19830-weezer-everything-will-be-alright-in-the-end/|6.5|Ian Cohen

It was <i>Afrodisiac</i>, a record the Nigerian bandleader had cut in London with his group, Africa '70, the previous year. In the liner notes that accompany <i>Fela: Vinyl Box Set 3—</i>which collects seven recently reissued Kuti LPs that he selected–Eno writes that, at the time, he “didn’t really get” polyrhythmic music. He changed his mind. “I remember the first time I listened and how dazzled I was by the groove and rhythmic complexity,” he writes. “My friend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4629-robert-wyatt/"">Robert Wyatt</a> called it ‘Jazz from another planet’ -and suddenly I thought I understood the point of jazz, until then an almost alien music to me.”</p>
<p>A few years later, in 1977, Eno played <i>Afrodisiac</i> for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"">Talking Heads</a> frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"">David Byrne</a>. Eventually he would collaborate with the band on its album <i>Remain in Light</i>, a record that drew heavy inspiration from African music. Amid the bonus tracks included on the Talking Heads’ <i>Brick </i>boxed set, there’s an unfinished outtake called “Fela’s Riff”. The introductory phrase of the track–which is really not much more than a half realized jam session–subtly mimic the ping-ponging brass figures of Kuti’s composition, “Alu Jon Jonki Jon”, the opening track on <i>Afrodisiac</i>. All this is to say: Brian Eno was, and is, a big Fela Kuti fan. </p>
<p>For a lot of people, Eno would turn out to be an important conduit to Kuti’s music, whether via his work on <i>Remain in Light</i> or its companion releases, <i>The</i> <i>Catherine Wheel</i> and <i>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</i>. And while he wasn’t Kuti’s only celebrity champion, he was among the most eloquently spoken. Over the next several decades, his support would steer countless rock bands, experimental artists, and dance producers toward Kuti. The significance of that music—now the subject of documentary films, Broadway musicals, and books—is well established. A Nigerian musician and political dissident, Kuti released dozens of records throughout the ’70s and ’80s that merged strains of jazz, funk, and African traditional music.</p>
<p>And with the possible exception of 1984’s <i>Army Arrangement</i>,<i> </i>there are really no bad Fela Kuti records. So, a boxed set isn’t a bad way to absorb his music. There’s not a lot of filler to wade through. The titles that Eno has picked for <i>Vinyl Box Set 3</i> are drawn mostly from Kuti’s early ’70s output, including <i>Shakara </i>(1972), <i>Fela’s London Scene</i> (1972), and <i>Gentleman </i>(1971). <i>Afrodisiac </i>is included, as well as three highlights from the later part of the decade, <i>Zombie </i>(1976), <i>Upside Down</i> (1976), and <i>I.T.T.</i> (1980). </p>
<p>It’s a lot to digest.

The music is constantly moving and mutating, but is also conveys a sense of stasis. Unlike jazz, the songs aren’t shaped by chord changes or modulations, but the gradual accumulation and subtraction of melodic and rhythmic gestures. The bass might hover on a single note or riff for an entire song. The steady crack of the snare, which helps to give rock music its steady push and pull, is constantly shifted and shuffled around. “It rolls, rocks, and snaps and makes you moves,” writes Eno, speaking about drummer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6152-tony-allen/"">Tony Allen</a>’s rhythms. “And yet it isn’t ever very regular—it’s hard to isolate the part that Tony Allen is playing because he’s constantly moving around it.”</p>
<p>The length of the compositions is also worth noting. One Kuti record might be made up of a single, highly repetitious sitcom-length composition.

It was <i>Afrodisiac</i>, a record the Nigerian bandleader had cut in London with his group, Africa '70, the previous year. In the liner notes that accompany <i>Fela: Vinyl Box Set 3—</i>which collects seven recently reissued Kuti LPs that he selected–Eno writes that, at the time, he “didn’t really get” polyrhythmic music. He changed his mind. “I remember the first time I listened and how dazzled I was by the groove and rhythmic complexity,” he writes. “My friend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4629-robert-wyatt/"">Robert Wyatt</a> called it ‘Jazz from another planet’ -and suddenly I thought I understood the point of jazz, until then an almost alien music to me.”</p>
<p>A few years later, in 1977, Eno played <i>Afrodisiac</i> for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"">Talking Heads</a> frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"">David Byrne</a>. Eventually he would collaborate with the band on its album <i>Remain in Light</i>, a record that drew heavy inspiration from African music. Amid the bonus tracks included on the Talking Heads’ <i>Brick </i>boxed set, there’s an unfinished outtake called “Fela’s Riff”. The introductory phrase of the track–which is really not much more than a half realized jam session–subtly mimic the ping-ponging brass figures of Kuti’s composition, “Alu Jon Jonki Jon”, the opening track on <i>Afrodisiac</i>. All this is to say: Brian Eno was, and is, a big Fela Kuti fan. </p>
<p>For a lot of people, Eno would turn out to be an important conduit to Kuti’s music, whether via his work on <i>Remain in Light</i> or its companion releases, <i>The</i> <i>Catherine Wheel</i> and <i>My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</i>. And while he wasn’t Kuti’s only celebrity champion, he was among the most eloquently spoken. Over the next several decades, his support would steer countless rock bands, experimental artists, and dance producers toward Kuti. The significance of that music—now the subject of documentary films, Broadway musicals, and books—is well established. A Nigerian musician and political dissident, Kuti released dozens of records throughout the ’70s and ’80s that merged strains of jazz, funk, and African traditional music.</p>
<p>And with the possible exception of 1984’s <i>Army Arrangement</i>,<i> </i>there are really no bad Fela Kuti records. So, a boxed set isn’t a bad way to absorb his music. There’s not a lot of filler to wade through. The titles that Eno has picked for <i>Vinyl Box Set 3</i> are drawn mostly from Kuti’s early ’70s output, including <i>Shakara </i>(1972), <i>Fela’s London Scene</i> (1972), and <i>Gentleman </i>(1971). <i>Afrodisiac </i>is included, as well as three highlights from the later part of the decade, <i>Zombie </i>(1976), <i>Upside Down</i> (1976), and <i>I.T.T.</i> (1980). </p>

The innovations that Kuti’s music generated are easy to take for granted now, but in the context of the mid-to-late ’70s—a decade heavy with, though not necessarily defined by, blues rock—Kuti’s band must have sounded pretty revelatory. The music is constantly moving and mutating, but is also conveys a sense of stasis. Unlike jazz, the songs aren’t shaped by chord changes or modulations, but the gradual accumulation and subtraction of melodic and rhythmic gestures. The bass might hover on a single note or riff for an entire song. The steady crack of the snare, which helps to give rock music its steady push and pull, is constantly shifted and shuffled around. “It rolls, rocks, and snaps and makes you moves,” writes Eno, speaking about drummer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6152-tony-allen/"">Tony Allen</a>’s rhythms. “And yet it isn’t ever very regular—it’s hard to isolate the part that Tony Allen is playing because he’s constantly moving around it.”</p>
<p>The length of the compositions is also worth noting. One Kuti record might be made up of a single, highly repetitious sitcom-length composition.

It was <i>Afrodisiac</i>, a record the Nigerian bandleader had cut in London with his group, Africa '70, the previous year. In the liner notes that accompany <i>Fela: Vinyl Box Set 3—</i>which collects seven recently reissued Kuti LPs that he selected–Eno writes that, at the time, he “didn’t really get” polyrhythmic music. He changed his mind. “I remember the first time I listened and how dazzled I was by the groove and rhythmic complexity,” he writes. “My friend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4629-robert-wyatt/"">Robert Wyatt</a> called it ‘Jazz from another planet’ -and suddenly I thought I understood the point of jazz, until then an almost alien music to me.”</p>
<p>A few years later, in 1977, Eno played <i>Afrodisiac</i> for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"">Talking Heads</a> frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"">David Byrne</a>. Eventually he would collaborate with the band on its album <i>Remain in Light</i>, a record that drew heavy inspiration from African music.

At one point, Pinchbeck, whose experiences with psychedelic drugs are matter not only of public record but professional pride, asks Jaar about his own experiences with the shadow world. Jaar answers that he’s never taken drugs—“just music”—and he goes on to explain that Darkside named their first album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18586-darkside-psychic/""><i>Psychic</i></a> because they felt as though to make the music that they needed to become mediums, bodies through which other beings spoke. “I feel like psychic shops in America symbolize so many things about today’s culture,” Jaar continues. “The first is that your future is turned into a commodity. But deeper than that, all of these shops are the psychics’ actual homes. They live there. This is their front room. When they close the drapes they have dinner there, amidst these crystal balls and stuff.”</p>
<p>That eerie balance—between the domestic and the mystical—has been at the heart of what most of Jaar has done so far. <i>Work</i>, the second compilation from his label Other People, collects a group of seemingly disparate artists unified by a preference for music that feels like it’s being made just around the corner, in the places where clarity gives over to darkness. Some of it sounds like techno, but techno made in no discernible hurry and with no obvious shape; some of it sounds like dub reggae built from static; some of it is limited to the sound of a single voice and a guitar. All of it shares the distinction of being psychedelic—something that’s playing inside your head and yet coming from somewhere infinitely far away. It’s good music for late nights and unshared couches, especially when afforded a little time for the mind to drift.</p>
<p>Part of Other People’s concept is that it works more like a magazine than a record label, inviting people by subscription and sending them new music at semi-regular intervals. One of the surprising—and somewhat limiting—aspects of <i>Work</i> is just how few of Other People’s artists it features, especially considering that as a compilation, it has the potential to reach more people than the label has subscribers. (Maybe only <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/drewgragg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drew Gragg</a> and I wish there was more Drew Gragg on here, but that at least makes two of us.) Nearly 28 minutes of <i>Work</i> consists of collaborations between Ancient Astronaut—who is on the label—and artists who aren’t; another ten minutes are outtakes from Darkside’s <i>Psychic</i>. In a way, the compilation serves more as a companion to the music the label has already put out than as an introduction to it.</p>
<p><i>Work</i> gets over on consistency of mood, which has marked all of Jaar’s projects and more or less everything on Other People, too. All the music here—however unrelated on the surface— belongs, yoked together by an invisible thread; less an appeal to the confines of genre than to mood: the impression the music leaves once you turn it off.  ""I would say that we’re less interested in a linear narrative and more in a larger journey,"" Harrington said in Darkside's interview with Pinchbeck. ""The feeling should be that you go on a spectral trip from the first sound to the last sound. You enter a space, you explore it, you walk around, and then you enter a new space."" The intention is clear, even if the trip doesn't end up taking you all that far. </p></div>"|19807.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19807-various-artists-work/|7.0|Mike Powell

By his own admission, he was floundering beneath a massive, unmanageable multiple-orchestra commission for the London Sinfonietta, and watching Greenwood's bracing, devoted rendition, originally written for Pat Metheny, he felt something settle in with a ""click.""  It occurred to him that, despite friends' repeated urgings, he had yet to ""check out"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"">Radiohead</a>, so he finally did. <i>Radio Rewrite</i>, a five-movement piece built on themes from Radiohead songs, was the result.</p>
<p>The songs he focused his piece around were ""Everything in Its Right Place"", from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13385-kid-a-special-collectors-edition/""><i>Kid A</i></a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10785-in-rainbows/""><i>In Rainbows</i></a>' ""Jigsaw Falling Into Place"". In an <a href=""http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/music/why-steve-reich-was-inspired-by-the-work-of-radioheads-jonny-greenwood.20338503"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> last year, he called the opening series of chords on ""Everything in Its Right Place"" ""one of the classics in Western music,"" elaborating: ""'Everything' is a very rich song. It's very simple and very complex at the same time. What does it mean? Maybe it's about a relationship, maybe I should ask <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4823-thom-yorke/"">Thom Yorke</a>.""</p>
<p>The piece itself doesn't <i>quote</i> Radiohead's songs, exactly, as cock a quizzical eyebrow towards them. You can hear the jagged heave of ""Jigsaw""'s rising action in the first movement, and the tabula rasa drone of ""Everything"" in the second, but by the third movement, the lines of transmission grow spotty, by design: ""The piece is a mixture of moments where you will hear Radiohead, but most moments where you won't,"" Reich remarked in an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAImOs3u-vc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with his publisher Boosey &amp; Hawkes. The harmonic language starts to complicate itself, stirring up clouds and creating something that feels more like a series of dreams the songs themselves are having than a straightforward tribute.</p>
<p>When Reich's music quietly departs from its source material, the piece achieves lift off, as the form fades and the piece settles into a seething, anxious rhythm of its own. The piece follows the by-now familiar Reich structure—pairs of movements, titled ""Fast "" and ""Slow"", alternating between thrumming low-level unease and calm—and the familiarity has a bittersweet tinge to it. When the piece directly references Radiohead, the piece feels troublingly like a printout, with new material going in one end and the churning minimalist music emerging reliably on the other.  His final two movements, with their scrambled rhythmic pulses and sumptuous string writing, help mitigate this feeling.</p>
<p>Jonny Greenwood's recording of <i>Electric Counterpoint</i>, meanwhile, feels genuinely <i>different</i>. His version, which he's honed live over years and is included on <i>Radio Rewrite</i>, has a nagging, insistent edge, with more space in between the guitars than in the famous Pat Metheny version, as if the tracks are echoing from opposite corners of a massive, empty room. Greenwood's phrasing is choppier; you can hear almost every pick strike, making it sometimes feel like you need to swat away a locust cloud. In Greenwood's hands, <i>Electric Counterpoint</i> suddenly becomes body music.</p>
<p>Greenwood's taken the unusual step of pre-recording 1o of the 11 guitar tracks that comprise the piece. His guitar tone is unmistakable, especially on the second movement, which directly channels ""Let Down"". Oddly, it feels more like more of a meeting of the minds between Reich and Radiohead than <i>Radio Rewrite</i> itself.  There is another piece on the album, a reworking of Reich's <i>Piano Counterpoint,</i> played here by Vicky Chow, who surfs atop the pre-recorded tracks with fierce aplomb. Watch her do it in real-time here, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx8r0wUh39o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">with a half-smile on her face</a>, to get a sense of her calm ease and total control, and then listen to this recording; you can almost hear the same half-smile.  It's ironic, and maybe fitting, that the younger musicians on this album find more easeful communion with the hardy, contrarian spirit of Reich's works than Reich does. </p></div>"|19818.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19818-steve-reich-radio-rewrite/|7.3|Jayson Greene

The first three—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30994-nocando/"">Nocando</a>'s spirited battler-turned-grown-man study <a href=""%20http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19113-nocando-jimmy-the-burnout/""><i>Jimmy the Burnout</i></a>, the melancholy, melodic humor of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30520-open-mike-eagle/"">Open Mike Eagle</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19477-open-mike-eagle-dark-comedy/""><i>Dark Comedy</i></a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/512-busdriver/"">Busdriver</a>'s slippery virtuoso poetry on <i>Perfect Hair</i>—were valuable reinforcements of the three names at the group's nucleus, a chance for them to gain a following outside their core constituency of L.A.-geared Project Blowed rap-nerd connoisseurs. milo isn't a total unknown by comparison, but with a couple scattered EPs and personality-switching alter ego side project Scallops Hotel providing most of his background on record, the Kenosha, Wisconsin-grown vet needs a bigger context to grow into.</p>
<p>His debut album, <i>a</i><i> toothpaste suburb,</i> does just as much to play up the commonalities milo has with his labelmates (and his place in the underground hip-hop world) as it does to show off just who he is himself. milo's own qualities are obvious from his first 16 bars: a heavy-lidded deadpan whose flow calmly lets the punchlines deliver themselves, whether they're references to Arthur Schopenhauer (this album has a few) or shameless fart jokes (ditto). Those aren't rare qualities—you get similar approaches on this very album from guests like Open Mike Eagle, who pulls Shel Silverstein wordplay (""Call me tiger 'cause I tige for a living"") on ""objectifying rabbits"", and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30151-kool-ad/"">Kool A.D.</a>, who is dementedly meta with a thinking-aloud verse on ""in gaol"". With the burbling, usually mellow digitalisms of producers iglooghost, Riley Lake, Greyhat, and Tastenothing giving his voice both gravity and lightness where it's needed, there's a feeling that milo's been able to get in where he fit in, not just got in 'cause he fought in.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But the realm of the West Coast art-wiseass black intellectual is neither one to take for granted or one to set a low barrier of entry for, and milo's place in and radiating outside of it is well earned off his own synthesis of experience. His referential eclecticism might otherwise seem random for its own sake in isolation, a string of phrases hammered into place; the second verse of ""sanssouci palace"" alone drops references to Avril Lavigne, </span><i>Clerks</i><span>, ""</span><span>Squidbillies""</span><span>, and the self-descriptor ""Rap messiah agitator/ Chronic bathroom masturbator,"" but the track starts cohering to depict a more complete identity the further it knits together.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And when it does, there's some deep rumination and staring into the void that exists beneath all the jokes. ""salladhor saan, smuggler"" is a stark autobio alluding to isolation and suicidal thoughts staved off by a steady diet of Jean Genet, </span><i>Office Space</i><span>, and the subsequent realization that milo was capable of total artistic freedom. And a recurring throughline, the too-soon passing of his friend Rob, is both alluded to and directly addressed with a mixture of survivor's guilt (""Now kids write me about being their favorite rapper/ And I'm the asshole who gets to live forever after""), yearning (""Ought implies can and I cannot""), and resignation (from ""Yafet's song"": ""Death is where we all go/ It can't be that bad""). So milo's voice acts fairly slow to reveal the intentions beneath the words' surface, trusting listeners to connect the dots. That's one way of staking a claim on curious ears, a connection to someone who, per ""a day trip to the nightosphere,"" doesn't dabble in secret societies. milo's society is far more open.</span></p></div>"|19878.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19878-milo-a-toothpaste-suburb/|7.8|Nate Patrin

The “experiment” was designed to solve the same problem the music industry has been grappling with since the heyday of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Fanning"" rel=""nofollow"">Shawn Fanning</a>—how to convince the digital world to pay for music. And the means were, if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18772-gatekeeper-young-chronos-ep/"">not exactly original</a>, unique for an artist of Yorke’s size: a payment system managed by a version of the file-sharing software BitTorrent, which relies on users sharing small pieces of a file in order to circulate a shared whole. “If it works well it could be an effective way of handing some control of internet commerce back to people who are creating the work,” Yorke and Godrich explained; it’s a very different sentiment from the one expressed by Radiohead’s management following <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10785-in-rainbows/""><i>In Rainbows</i></a> in 2007, when they described the pay-what-you-want approach for that album as “a solution for Radiohead, not the industry.”</p>
<p>BitTorrent involvement aside, Yorke and Godrich have essentially released music for sale on short notice, something Radiohead did already with their 2011 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15149-the-king-of-limbs/""><i>The King of Limbs</i></a>. In 2013, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4910-beyonce/"">Beyoncé</a>’s surprise <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18821-beyonce-beyonce/"">self-titled album-cum-multimedia extravaganza</a> represented a generational shift six years after <i>In Rainbows:</i> the catchphrase ""Pulling a Radiohead” was summarily replaced by “pulling a Beyoncé”. On the other end of the spectrum, recent model-busting approaches by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18247-jay-z-magna-carta-holy-grail/"">Jay-Z</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19816-u2-songs-of-innocence/"">U2</a> were met with cynicism and disdain. Compared to these high-profile campaigns, the reception to <i>Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes</i>’ distribution gambit has been unremarkable, a collective shoulder-shrug.</p>
<p>Indeed, for a solo release from a member of one of the world’s biggest rock bands, nearly everything about the album feels slight: the title, which is ostensibly a commentary on digital commerce but sounds more like a corporate slogan for <a href=""http://www.ups.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">a shipping company</a>; the sparse, forgettable artwork; the video for lead track “A Brain in a Bottle”, itself a herky-jerky update of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfOa1a8hYP8"" rel=""nofollow"">the clip for <i>The King of Limbs</i>’ blooming “Lotus Flower” single</a>; the price, a scant $6 for an eight-track album that would typically go for at least $3 more at most digital retailers; and the runtime, which just barely cracks a half-hour, the shortest non-Radiohead album the singer has been involved with. Yorke—and, by extension, Radiohead—has spent the last two decades making a virtue of evading celebrity, but even by that measure, the presentation of <i>Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes</i> comes across as quaint.</p>
<p>The same goes for the music, which represent Yorke’s strongest embrace of electronics to date. Radiohead once shattered the notion of what a rock band could be sonically, but even their most experimental albums had a beating heart, (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-q4zz6HvdiM"" rel=""nofollow"">not to</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJ1iMQA0egc"" rel=""nofollow"">mention a</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vMDKg4MMN8"" rel=""nofollow"">guitar or two</a>); Yorke’s first solo album, 2006’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9183-the-eraser/""><i>The Eraser</i></a>, was chilly in its electronic explorations but it retained a sense of melody and pathos, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17632-atoms-for-peace-amok/""><i>AMOK</i></a>, last year’s forgettable debut effort from the Yorke-led <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28660-atoms-for-peace/"">Atoms for Peace</a> supergroup, contrasted bleep-bloop tendencies with a distinct live-band feel. On <i>Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes</i>, the line between man and machine has blurred to the point of disappearing, with Yorke’s vocals blending seamlessly with glitchy textures and stuttering beats. The result is in one sense the most challenging high-profile release of Yorke’s career—there’s precious little to grab on to in terms of melody and feeling, and you won’t find yourself humming along to anything here.</p>
<p>That said, certain elements of <i>Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes</i>, if given the right amount of attention, can be enjoyable to luxuriate in. “Guess Again!” is possibly the most Radiohead-like track on the album, a mid-tempo traipse of decaying pianos and crunchy backbeats that anyone who’s listened to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2VzLn6DMCE"" rel=""nofollow"">“Pyramid Song”</a> on loop will find instantly recognizable; the six-minute sorta-centerpiece “The Mother Lode” unfurls with layered vocal-abstracted samples and a skipping rhythmic gait that congeals with Yorke’s delicate high register, climaxing mid-track with a beautiful wordless digression. “Pink Section” brings more deconstructed piano—the most notable non-synthetic sound that appears frequently on <i>Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes</i>—to the forefront amidst a low, whistling howl, and the track nicely segues into closer “Nose Grows Some”, a mix of winding tones and subtly forceful rhythmic backbone with Yorke projecting an exquisite vocal presence at the forefront.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <i>Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes</i> slips into tedium. The wavering motifs and squelchy low end of “A Brain in a Bottle”, along with the seven-minute rabbit-hole excursion “There Is No Ice (For My Drink)”, present rough, unappealing approaches to beat-building that call to mind Yorke’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/51079-listen-thom-yorke-honey-pot/"">dicey attempts at dance music</a>; the piping tones of “Truth Ray” stand in place instead of building to any sort of resolution, and the largely beatless “Interference” represents a similar stasis. “I don’t have the right/ To interfere,” he sings in the song’s anti-chorus, underscoring the album’s general sense of passivity. As Yorke’s least satisfying work to date, <i>Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes</i> can’t help but build anticipation for whatever Radiohead plans to do next—his need for a creative foil has never been more apparent.</p></div>"|19894.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19894-thom-yorke-tomorrows-modern-boxes/|6.3|Larry Fitzmaurice

Take ""Milk"", from her lovely 2011 record as Sea Oleena, <i>Sleeplessness</i>: the song cuts sharp trip-hop edges with open-air instrumentation and a whisper of tape hiss, while bass notes played on piano loom against Loseth's spiraling vocal layers. It could be a long-lost cousin to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"">Massive Attack</a>'s ""Teardrop"", hookless but sticky, full of breath and dust instead of computerized shine. <i>Shallow</i>, Loseth's third release as Sea Oleena and her first full-length, sheds everything that ticked about ""Milk""—the beats, the hard lines, the resolutions—instead skirting easy answers and quick release, grasping at something more patient, sad, and subtle. </p>
<p><span><i>Shallow</i> diffuses the same pale light that's characterized Sea Oleena so far, as Loseth makes space to apply her textural instincts toward more ambitious tensions. The album crests on her longest track to date, ""Vinton, LA"", which shivers through its 11 minutes on nothing but piano, strings, voice, and the effects that multiply them. Loseth spaces out her syllables, letting the lyrics swell and hang loose as another ambient texture until the listener's able to stitch them together. Acclimate to her syntax, and the song reveals a furtive unease in its calm. ""I was alone and so overwhelmed,"" she sings, the last word's three syllables ballooning into a canopy. She sings about swimming in the ocean, swallowing its salt, losing the self but keeping its shadow, all while cellos low beneath her words.</span></p>
<p><span>As a whole, <i>Shallow</i> runs dense with ""ifs"": its opening track, ""If I'm"", tips its lyrics with its title as the strongest beat on the album supplies a smooth bridge between it and <i>Sleeplessness</i>. ""If I'm the forest, you're the field at my feet,"" she sings. ""If I'm the corner that the dark backs into/ You're the darkness that this corner clings to."" </span><span>Slowly, in the patterns she repeats through her lyrics, Loseth builds an ambient narrative that's shy enough to drift right past on cursory listens. She exploits the dynamics inherent in the imagery of darkness versus light, mountains versus seas, forests versus fields. There is pain locked deep inside this album—which, ironically, comes across as a balm from pain, as though the only way to sing out the darknesses was to soothe them at the same time. </span></p>
<p><span>On the cover of <i>Shallow</i>, someone beckons away from the camera with a bloodied finger, a red bracelet on her wrist, or maybe a thin wound where the blood came from. It's an unsettling image, and <i>Shallow </i>possesses a similar unease. On the record's closing track, ""Paths"", Loseth repeats the line, ""yours is a path I'd like to cross."" It's a love song, and a song about submission, need, brokenness, and pain. Sea Oleena dissolves hurt and comfort into the same mist, and never once flinches at how close they swirl to each other. </span></p></div>"|19756.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19756-sea-oleena-shallow/|7.1|Sasha Geffen

It’s largely ignored, or at best pitied, and without a visual or cultural anchor, some modern listeners tune out when classical music comes on the speakers. What is Wagner's <i>Ride</i> <i>of the Valkyries</i> without some helicopters <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKaYOW9zMoY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">flying over a beach in Vietnam</a>? What is Stravinsky’s <i>Rite of Spring </i>without <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5rg3OCJRUQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the history of the dawn of time</a>? Moreover, chamber music ensemble yMusic's latest work, <i>Balance Problems, </i>earns its own cultural boost with indie rock names <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens"">Sufjan Stevens</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5641-son-lux/"">Son Lux</a> attached to it.</p>
<p>In a series of essays published last year, Owen Pallett <a href=""http://www.slate.com/authors.owen_pallett.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">unpacked songs from Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, and Daft Punk</a> using music theory to show why these pop songs are, in fact, works of genius. Reading these essays is akin to learning how a magic trick is performed; it ruins the illusion and shows how all music can be reduced to a basic formula; if the best pop music hides that formula, classical music lays it out like a proof on a chalkboard. The better you know the formula, arguably, the more you get out of it, and <i>Balance Problems</i> addresses this great divide in subtle ways. Through the deft production of Son Lux's Ryan Lott, the seam between pop and classical is sewed tight, as he, the yMusic sextet, and seven composers take the tenets of modern classical music and breathe new life into it. These also are not staid, mannered pieces of music; <i>Balance Problems</i> functions on its own accord and can be enjoyed without signifiers or prerequisite understanding of any formula.</p>
<p>yMusic play these compositions as though they’ve absorbed a full range of physical gestures and human emotions. These are very human-sounding pieces of music, similar to what Lott aims for with his own solo work. Here, he takes the work of Pulitzer Prize nominee Andrew Norman, pioneering modernist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6442-nico-muhly/"">Nico Muhly</a>, young downtown music acolyte Timo Andres, and restless pop chameleon Sufjan Stevens and helps bring their work into a 21st century context. Norman’s flashy ""Music in Circles"" stands as the highlight of the album, due in part to the familiarity of its structure. In keeping with the theme of its title, it’s a piece that ends where it begins, with violist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31183-nadia-sirota/"">Nadia Sirota</a> playing the lowest note on her viola, taking a breath, then playing the highest note on her viola, a harmonic miles above the staff. Turn it up loud enough and you can actually hear someone’s breath around the pianissimo notes she bows. These moments that bookend ""Music in Circles"" are stark, simple, and successful.</p>
<p>Each piece yMusic performs is filled with minute gestures. Marcos Balter's “Bladed Stance” creates the illusion of depth with the various tempos yMusic play simultaneously, as breathless flute arpeggios zoom by while a violin skitters by, at a slower speed, in the distance. Nico Muhly’s dense title track is perhaps the most ambitious work here, with pizzicato strings bending and sliding around ever-changing woodwind motifs. When an acoustic guitar enters, it feels as foreign as a drum solo, but it also creates a comforting familiarity.</p>
<p>Sufjan Stevens closes the album, and when pitted against the other compositions it comes across as a footnote. “The Human Plague” features the most production on the album, using delayed and gated effects with just one rhythm repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>. Against the dynamic and unpredictable nature of Timo Andres’ “Safe Travels”, Stevens’ contribution sounds perfunctory; but after an album of music that channels a feeling from a century ago, it also represents a reconnection to the form of a modern, simple pop song. </p>
<p>In his indispensable book about the history of modern music, <i>The Rest Is Noise, </i>Alex Ross talked<i> </i>of the changing sentiments of music as it came into the 20th century, especially around the premiere of Stravinsky’s <i>Rite of Spring </i>in 1913<i>.</i> Ross wrote, “… now composers would create a music of the body. Melodies would follow the patterns of speech; rhythms would match the energy of dance; musical forms would be more concise and clear; sonorities would have the hardness of life as it is really lived.” yMusic and the composers reflect that sentiment, recapturing that time before the minimalism and experimentalism of the 20th century, serving as a conduit to a time of tradition, and channeling the several emotions of the world into wordless compositions.</p></div>"|19752.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19752-ymusic-balance-problems/|7.6|Jeremy D.

From 1990, when Kenny ""Dope"" Gonzalez and ""Little"" Louie Vega launched their partnership with a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dhovmugIxo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">deep house remix</a> of Debbie Gibson's ""One Step Ahead"", to 2000, when they celebrated their tenth anniversary with a pair of four-CD boxed sets, they were almost unbelievably prolific. In that first decade, Masters at Work released something on the order of 500 remixes, as well as a mountain of their own records under various names (most notably Nuyorican Soul), and effectively defined the house music sound of that decade: the metronomic piston of Gonzalez's beats, the dissonant jazz and salsa chords of Vega's keyboards, live instrumentation weaving around programmed rhythms, vocals slashed up and looped to reveal the oddest grains in singers' timbres.</p>
<p>And then, after 2002's <i>Our Time Is Coming</i> album, the cascade dried to a trickle. Masters at Work never quite broke up, and they've continued to DJ and to produce the occasional high-profile remix together, but there's scarcely a sign on this four-disc retrospective that they kept going after their golden decade. Their set in the <i>House Masters</i> series isn't exactly a greatest-hits—a MAW compilation that doesn't include Nuyorican Soul's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mjhqTEsLBQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""It's Alright, I Feel It""</a> or Hardrive's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRH05Nq_JI0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Deep Inside""</a> doesn't qualify as a collection of their career peaks. Instead, they've assembled this collection to acquaint youngsters with overlooked bits of their discography as well as some of their best-known records.</p>
<p>What they've put together here is two discs of vocal tracks and another two that are more or less dubs and instrumentals, all scrambled chronologically but with a few smart juxtapositions. A pair of disco covers—Incognito <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPadpHpFxRs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">souping up</a> the Jones Girls' 1981 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzxwZ6wjDAM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Nights Over Egypt""</a> and Nuyorican Soul's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVHW1LCE6vI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">faithful remake</a> of the Salsoul Orchestra's 1977 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuAcU3pQ_7Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Runaway""</a>—serve as a reminder of how much Vega and Gonzalez learned from the grand arrangements of the mirror-ball era. And leading off the second disc with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYxZaLhNpTQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Can't Get No Sleep""</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEfMQZVtC_0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""When You Touch Me""</a>, two killer collaborations with salsa star India (who was then married to Vega), is a strong argument for the power and strangeness of their songwriting, as well as the way they could shape a track around a singer's voice.</p>
<p>Their remixes were sometimes more about overpowering their source material than reworking it. You could feed anything into the gaping maw of MAW—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3682-saint-etienne/"">Saint Etienne</a>, uilleann pipes, reggae, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28089-baaba-maal/"">Baaba Maal</a>, hip-hop, George Benson—and it would come out as a pumping, DJ-ready house record. Still, when they remixed a vocalist they especially liked, they rose to the challenge, as with the radiant <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY9IRVgf1rw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ten-minute version</a> of Bebe Winans' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWFbf-YlHZE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Thank You""</a> that opens <i>House Masters</i>.</p>
<p>When Gonzalez and Vega gave themselves license to experiment, though, they sometimes struck gold; their weirdest throwaways could spawn entire new subgenres. Gonzalez <a href=""http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/masters-at-work?template=RBMA_Lecture%2Ftranscript"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has noted</a> that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_URFoqkwWLY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Ha Dance""</a>, from 1991--a groove built around a tiny sample of the movie <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCERfa8LcS4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trading Places</a></i>--probably took them ""like two hours"" to make; pretty much the entire <a href=""http://www.xlr8r.com/features/2011/04/strictly-ballroom-after-decades-"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vogue fem</a> music scene revolves around its legacy. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRoIuEe6Bbs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Nervous Track""</a>, a hyper-syncopated riff with frantic drumming and standup bass, appeared in 1993, and a year or two later ""broken beat"" sprouted from the Masters' heavy footprints.</p>
<p>The MAW tracks that hold up best a decade or two later (and outside a club setting), though, are often the ones with unpredictable or spontaneous elements. India's vocal on ""I Can't Get No Sleep"" was edited from a flu-ridden improvisation; ""Deep Inside"" was an ad-libbed fragment from the Masters' production of Barbara Tucker's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAicP_hZzXs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Beautiful People""</a> (which doesn't appear on <i>House Masters</i> either), spun out into a record of its own. And if Black Masses' <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m6p1tpFP54"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Wonderful Person""</a> isn't the result of someone trying to sing Linda Clifford's 1978 disco song <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61kGkzh4lCI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Are, You Are""</a>, forgetting everything but the hook and making up new lyrics around it, then it might as well be.</p>
<p>The moments when one of Masters at Work's collaborators throw them off-balance mean a lot, because they're otherwise so firmly rooted in the conventions of '90s club music—conventions which, to be fair, they helped to establish. Gonzalez and Vega built their career on being a beat factory, but the most enduring work of the years when they dominated the dance floor came from the times their studio was an experimental lab instead.</p></div>"|19831.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19831-masters-at-work-house-masters/|7.8|Douglas Wolk

The band’s lackluster 2010 effort <i>Black Masses</i> fell rather flat, trailing its own hailed predecessor with a rote, lifeless performance. It sounded like the band had gotten cocky, resting comfortably on laurels sprouted after the roaring success of 2007’s <i>Witchcult Today</i>, the catchy, menacing genius of which (thanks in no small part to guitarist Liz Buckingham’s inspired riffs) earned a place of reverence within the modern doom canon. It took some time for them to refine their footing, and after shunning live appearances for years, the band began playing live with unprecedented frequency. That added dose of energy has clearly seeped into these new tunes—there’s a rawness and immediacy that will surely translate well into a live setting.</p>
<p class=""p1"">From the first burbling moments and crackling sample from a 1984 ""20/20"" special on ""Acid King"" Richard Kasso, <i>Time to Die</i> holds its listeners close, inviting us into a warped echo chamber of horrors filled with eldritch evil. From their beginnings, Electric Wizard’s whole shtick has revolved around drugs, sleazy horror movies, and drawn-out stoner riffs designed to gnaw through your skull. Songs like “We Love the Dead” and “Destroy Those Who Love God” nod at the band’s gleeful urge to shock, and “I Am Nothing” hints at the darker thoughts that may swirl past the velvet-swaddled nymphs and technicolor gore in its creator’s head. Vocalist Jus Oborn doesn’t really sing; rather, he mumbles, he whines, and above all, he wails, his high warble losing itself in the music as easily as if it were a moonless night on the moors.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Recently recruited bassist Clayton Burgess, of heavy garage punks Satan’s Satyrs, places his stamp on the fuzz-drenched low end while drummer Mark Greening holds court behind the kit, crashing and bashing with impeccable timing and remarkable restraint. This marks Greening’s first time playing and recording with the band since 2002’s immortal <i>Let Us Prey</i>, and he makes his presence known. It takes a veteran to add the amount of pure heft these songs need to stay in line, and Greening makes it look easy. He and Burgess are crucial to the proceedings, especially given the significance the rhythm section holds in anchoring those mammoth grooves and providing support for the all-important riffs.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Buckingham’s swinging saturnine riffs solidify Electric Wizard's reputation, even buried under the customary leagues of distortion and reverb; Oborn holds his own too, especially during those wah-wah solos and moments of cosmic shred on “Funeral of Your Mind”. The garage-rock-tinged psychedelic rocker is the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"">Black Sabbath</a> song that Birmingham’s finest could've written if they had stuck with the drugs and stayed off the telly, and the same could be said of nearly everything Electric Wizard has written: their worship for the Sab Four bleeds through in their work so garishly that it would be funny if the band wasn’t so deadly serious. </p>
<p class=""p1"">“SadioWitch” finds Oborn sneering over a perversely simple rock beat, and “We Love the Dead” is an impossibly murky dirge built upon a zombified tempo, eerie melody, and elephantine central riff with sustain so pronounced you can hear Buckingham’s fingers vibrating over the frets before the psychedelic freakout that caps it all off. Between the ominous media muttering and unconscionably tense guitar drones,  “Destroy Those Who Love God” is more than a little unnerving; meanwhile, an eerie Moog synth drives instrumental album closer “Saturn Dethroned”, slowly collapsing and dissolving into the same burbling stream that kicked off the album. It’s rare to see a band as established as Electric Wizard come back from a slump with renewed vigor and a fresh shot of hellfire coursing through their veins, but with <i>Time to Die</i>, they’ve both surpassed expectations and proved that they’re still as vital as they ever were.</p></div>"|19622.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19622-electric-wizard-time-to-die/|7.9|Kim Kelly

By teaming up with Canadian producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29232-lunice/"">Lunice</a> to form <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30305-tnght/"">TNGHT</a>, he reached a level of prominence that would have been unimaginable in 2009, when he was churning out zany pieces of purple on releases like the <i>Polyfolk Dance</i> EP and debut full-length <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13557-butter/"">Butter</a></i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13557-butter/""></a>. When an unreleased TNGHT song called ""R U Ready"" served as the backbone for the titanic centerpiece of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye West</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus/""><i>Yeezus</i></a>, ""Blood on the Leaves"", it was the cherry on top of an astounding rise. Since then, Mohawke has racked up credits on <i>Yeezus</i> track ""I Am a God"", Drake's ""Connect"", and Pusha T's ""Hold On"", meaning that he had a hand in highlights from three of 2013's biggest rap records. Where he was once bandied about by tastemakers as a potentially innovative force in hip-hop production, he's now earned the opportunity to do so at the genre's highest possible level. Acting as a possible precursor to Mohawke's next, perpetually delayed full-length—he told <a href=""http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/hudson-mohawke-qa-the-new-albums-coming-this-year"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the <i>NME</i></a> in March 2013 the album was coming out later that year—the <i>Chimes </i>EP is his first true solo record in over three years, serving as evidence of just how much he's grown in the time since.</p>
<p>The song that gives the EP its title is also its most fleshed-out track. Given the impact Mohawke's had on the ascent of maximalism in contemporary electronic music, it's remarkable how lean ""Chimes"" is: it's loud, and certainly weighty on its low end, but it's not particularly dense. TNGHT bangers such as ""Higher Ground"" and ""Goooo"" shot off sound and light in every direction before falling into earth-shaking climaxes; here, Mohawke's paring down of his compositions parallels that of his Glaswegian contemporary <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"">Rustie</a>, whose sophomore LP from this year, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19610-rustie-green-language/"">Green Language</a>,</i> was proof of a similar refinement. Although ""Chimes"" may mark a step forward in one regard, it's also static in terms of tempo. The remix provided by prolific UK producer Gammer that bookends the EP suffers from the same problem: it's sped up and flecked with added percussion, but it also lacks a push-pull velocity change.</p>
<p>The other two tracks on <i>Chimes</i> are minor but they do expand Mohawke's repertoire. ""Brainwave"" is a brooding synth workout, haunted by soaring choir work reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"">M83</a>; it's not hard to imagine the tune filling a slot on the soundtrack of an ambitious sci-fi movie. Meanwhile, ""King Kong Beaver"" is a flash of the hyperkinetic, colorful funk that marked Mohawke's early career, a dalliance into a style that's since been refined and repurposed by younger producers with phenomenal success. ""King Kong Beaver"" also inadvertently serves as a reminder of Mohawke's interesting current position in electronic music: he's undeniably influential, and certainly popular, but his solo catalog still lacks a masterwork, something that would secure his place in the pantheon of active producers. For now, <i>Chimes</i> does a fine job of sustaining his momentum.</p></div>"|19874.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19874-hudson-mohawke-chimes-ep/|6.7|Jamieson Cox

They just try harder.</p>
<p>Unfortunate <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-fire-colossus-six-flags-magic-mountain-20140908-story.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">connotations of its title aside</a>, “Magic Mountain” is meant to be a colossus—lunging out of the speakers, it’s the Drums’ loudest song to date, featuring Jonathan Pierce’s most strident vocal performance and a nasty surf-rock riff that posits <i>Encyclopedia</i> as a potentially evil twin of their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14333-the-drums/"">bleach blonde self-titled debut from 2010</a>. And those features are subtle compared to what follows. For the purposes of understanding the general ambitions of <i>Encyclopedia</i>, I want you to read the following sentence: “Inside my magic mountain/ We don’t have to be with them/ Inside my magic mountain/ Our hearts are out.” Imagine it being yelled. Then read it again, a dozen more times. That’s “Magic Mountain” and also just about every other song on <i>Encyclopedia</i>, wherein the Drums introduce the chorus right up front, telling you what they’re going to say, saying it, and reminding you what they just said.</p>
<p>Which is fair enough, since the Drums have always been melody-first classicists, and <i>Encyclopedia</i> spans their entire range: you get the melodramatic '60s pop approximation (“I Hope Time Doesn’t Change Him”), jumped-up pantry boyishness (“Kiss Me Again”, which is far superior to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19603-morrissey-world-peace-is-none-of-your-business/"">Morrissey’s recent “Kiss Me a Lot”</a>), and just about every form of '80s indie rock loved by Americans who not-so-secretly wish they were British. Because this is a Drums album, a great number of songs casually mention suicide or some other heavenly way to die—on “U.S. National Park”, Pierce begs to be spared a campground death, which raises the question of what he was doing there in the first place.</p>
<p>This stylistic shift would serve the Drums better if they were a punchy, “don’t bore us, get to the chorus and then get out” sort of band.  Maybe they were at some point, but on <i>Encylopedia</i>, their most hook-intensive album also turns out to be their “experimental” album. These songs don’t need to be more than two and a half minutes long—and yet, most go on for twice that length; “Magic Mountain” repeats its hook only six times even though it seems like twice as much, and there are also multiple fake endings.</p>
<p>The overall arc of <i>Encyclopedia</i> is, appropriately enough, a comprehensive document of the Drums' entire career<span>. </span>They may have annoyed you up front, but damn, those songs were catchy. You wondered how long they could keep it up, and all of a sudden, it was better than you expected. But all of the great songs are in the first half, so just when you think they’re in it for the long haul, they lose you and the expectations are lowered for the next time, so they can surprise you all over again. The Drums are at least halfway to amassing a pretty great singles comp—they just can’t really call it a <i>Greatest Hits</i>.</p></div>"|19850.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19850-the-drums-encyclopedia/|5.9|Ian Cohen

A nation of kids who first saw Molly Ringwald turn a Salvation Army dress into a Cinderella gown—and Jon Cryer claim the Boomer music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5721-otis-redding"">Otis Redding</a> for the fledgling Generation X—had grown out of the '80s and into connoisseurs of secondhand chic. Naturally there was irony involved—this was the '90s—and during one of the most prosperous decades America had ever known, slumming it became an archly conspicuous statement. But an aesthetic doesn’t need to be entirely ironic or entirely earnest, and such was the case with thrift. Yard-sale artifacts were throwaways, true, but they were also beautiful: emblems and totems of those who’d owned them, a transmutation of the mass-produced into the personal.</p>
<p>So it would be unfair to dismiss the Aislers Set’s three-album discography—1998’s <i>Terrible Things Happen</i>, 2000’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/85-the-last-match/""><i>The Last Match</i></a>, and 2003’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/86-how-i-learned-to-write-backwards/""><i>How I Learned to Write Backwards</i></a>—as a manifestation of “One demographic’s trash is another demographic’s treasure.” If anything, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55955-the-aislers-set-announce-reissue-campaign-reunion-tour/"">recently reunited</a> San Francisco indie-pop group embodied the demise of thrift-store culture as it existed then, straddling the movement’s '90s peak and its gradual decline in the new millennium, when people began cherry-picking their castoffs for Craigslist or eBay—or repurposing them for Etsy—instead of hauling them wholesale to Goodwill. More conceptual bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3382-pram/"">Pram</a>, clear influences on the Aislers Set, had already mixed upscale Midcentury and high-brow hi-fi into their bric-a-brac collage. The Aislers Set, on the other hand, had no hope of unearthing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"">Neu!</a> or Astrud Gilberto at their local thrift store—just <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/685-wendy-carlos/"">Wendy Carlos</a> and the Archies.</p>
<p>That’s not to say the Aislers Set’s debut album, <i>Terrible Things Happen</i>, isn’t sophisticated. The outfit’s mastermind, Amy Linton, had previously fronted Henry’s Dress, a cornerstone of Slumberland Records’ early roster and a bridge between Britain’s bygone <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19423-c86/"">C86</a></i> glory and the U.S. indie-pop scene that exploded in the '90s. <i>Terrible Things Happen</i>, like the remainder of the Aislers Set’s full-lengths, came out on Slumberland as well, and it marked a sea change. Up to that point, punky jangle had been the order of the day, a singsong, buzzsaw whirlwind that Henry’s Dress exemplified. Linton tried new things on <i>Terrible Things Happen</i>: layered harmonies, dynamic shifts between distorted riffs and acoustic strumming, adventurous arrangements, and dreamy, chanson ambience straight out of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5816-david-lynch/"">David Lynch</a> roadhouse. For every speedy, noisy, birthday-cake splattered track like “Holiday Gone Well”, there’s a lost-astronaut lullaby like “Alicia’s Song”, which even playfully swipes the intro/outro drumbeat of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWm03wYBTbM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Five Years”</a>.</p>
<p>Where <i>Terrible Things Happen</i> dips its toe, <i>The Last Match</i> dives right in. By then, Linton’s project had assumed a more solid lineup, and with it came a shag-carpet kind of luxuriousness. Hints of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3682-saint-etienne/"">Saint Etienne</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"">Belle and Sebastian</a>'s precious pop abound—Linton’s voice is a burst of minty-fresh breathiness, and there’s a cellophane-crisp shimmer to the production—but it’s the '60s influences that have taken hold. The instrumental “Christmas Song” nods to the sauntering hook from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50xx1_CbJTI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Time Is Tight”</a> by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7411-booker-t-the-mgs/"">Booker T. &amp; the MG</a>’s, and accordingly, the entire album uses vintage organs as a gluey connective tissue. “Hit the Snow” is the album’s standout moment, a confection of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4651-brian-wilson/"">Brian Wilson</a> ba-ba-bas and finger-snapping, go-go pep. Granted, these signifiers—even the organs—were all easily found in thrift stores in the '90s. <i>The Last Match</i> is the Aislers Set’s near-perfect unpacking of them; listening to the album is like popping bubble wrap, and just as satisfyingly addictive. </p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/86-how-i-learned-to-write-backwards/""><i>How I Learned to Write Backwards</i></a><i> </i>sharpened the Aislers Set’s fuzziness, but something small was lost in that precision. The songs themselves are Linton’s most assured, and her self-observational lyrics about pensive days and sleepless nights circumvent the band’s carefully constructed cuteness and slip straight into the heart. There’s also more space and abstraction to the album; “Melody Not Malaise” not only injects a hazy jazziness into the song’s swirly pop, but also implies the chords rather than states them.

A nation of kids who first saw Molly Ringwald turn a Salvation Army dress into a Cinderella gown—and Jon Cryer claim the Boomer music of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5721-otis-redding"">Otis Redding</a> for the fledgling Generation X—had grown out of the '80s and into connoisseurs of secondhand chic. Naturally there was irony involved—this was the '90s—and during one of the most prosperous decades America had ever known, slumming it became an archly conspicuous statement. But an aesthetic doesn’t need to be entirely ironic or entirely earnest, and such was the case with thrift. Yard-sale artifacts were throwaways, true, but they were also beautiful: emblems and totems of those who’d owned them, a transmutation of the mass-produced into the personal.</p>
<p>So it would be unfair to dismiss the Aislers Set’s three-album discography—1998’s <i>Terrible Things Happen</i>, 2000’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/85-the-last-match/""><i>The Last Match</i></a>, and 2003’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/86-how-i-learned-to-write-backwards/""><i>How I Learned to Write Backwards</i></a>—as a manifestation of “One demographic’s trash is another demographic’s treasure.” If anything, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55955-the-aislers-set-announce-reissue-campaign-reunion-tour/"">recently reunited</a> San Francisco indie-pop group embodied the demise of thrift-store culture as it existed then, straddling the movement’s '90s peak and its gradual decline in the new millennium, when people began cherry-picking their castoffs for Craigslist or eBay—or repurposing them for Etsy—instead of hauling them wholesale to Goodwill. More conceptual bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3382-pram/"">Pram</a>, clear influences on the Aislers Set, had already mixed upscale Midcentury and high-brow hi-fi into their bric-a-brac collage. The Aislers Set, on the other hand, had no hope of unearthing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"">Neu!</a> or Astrud Gilberto at their local thrift store—just <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/685-wendy-carlos/"">Wendy Carlos</a> and the Archies.</p>
<p>That’s not to say the Aislers Set’s debut album, <i>Terrible Things Happen</i>, isn’t sophisticated. The outfit’s mastermind, Amy Linton, had previously fronted Henry’s Dress, a cornerstone of Slumberland Records’ early roster and a bridge between Britain’s bygone <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19423-c86/"">C86</a></i> glory and the U.S. indie-pop scene that exploded in the '90s. <i>Terrible Things Happen</i>, like the remainder of the Aislers Set’s full-lengths, came out on Slumberland as well, and it marked a sea change. Up to that point, punky jangle had been the order of the day, a singsong, buzzsaw whirlwind that Henry’s Dress exemplified. Linton tried new things on <i>Terrible Things Happen</i>: layered harmonies, dynamic shifts between distorted riffs and acoustic strumming, adventurous arrangements, and dreamy, chanson ambience straight out of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5816-david-lynch/"">David Lynch</a> roadhouse. For every speedy, noisy, birthday-cake splattered track like “Holiday Gone Well”, there’s a lost-astronaut lullaby like “Alicia’s Song”, which even playfully swipes the intro/outro drumbeat of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWm03wYBTbM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Five Years”</a>.</p>
<p>Where <i>Terrible Things Happen</i> dips its toe, <i>The Last Match</i> dives right in. By then, Linton’s project had assumed a more solid lineup, and with it came a shag-carpet kind of luxuriousness. Hints of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3682-saint-etienne/"">Saint Etienne</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"">Belle and Sebastian</a>'s precious pop abound—Linton’s voice is a burst of minty-fresh breathiness, and there’s a cellophane-crisp shimmer to the production—but it’s the '60s influences that have taken hold. The instrumental “Christmas Song” nods to the sauntering hook from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50xx1_CbJTI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Time Is Tight”</a> by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7411-booker-t-the-mgs/"">Booker T. &amp; the MG</a>’s, and accordingly, the entire album uses vintage organs as a gluey connective tissue. “Hit the Snow” is the album’s standout moment, a confection of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4651-brian-wilson/"">Brian Wilson</a> ba-ba-bas and finger-snapping, go-go pep. Granted, these signifiers—even the organs—were all easily found in thrift stores in the '90s. <i>The Last Match</i> is the Aislers Set’s near-perfect unpacking of them; listening to the album is like popping bubble wrap, and just as satisfyingly addictive. </p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/86-how-i-learned-to-write-backwards/""><i>How I Learned to Write Backwards</i></a><i> </i>sharpened the Aislers Set’s fuzziness, but something small was lost in that precision. The songs themselves are Linton’s most assured, and her self-observational lyrics about pensive days and sleepless nights circumvent the band’s carefully constructed cuteness and slip straight into the heart. There’s also more space and abstraction to the album; “Melody Not Malaise” not only injects a hazy jazziness into the song’s swirly pop, but also implies the chords rather than states them. A snotty-sweet punk interlude (“The Train #2”) and a sumptuously sad, piano-led ballad (“Sara’s Song”) are strong evidence that Linton and crew were only hitting their stride.

Here, the pair team up for <i>Savage Imagination</i>, released just over a year later. Everything is a little tighter and brighter, with the personalities of Minekawa and Wong burning harder than before. It’s a jubilant, uplifting work, taking on several shades of happiness as it turns through its 43 minutes. It becomes delirious, then studied, then affable, a process the pair loops through and then turns inside out over and over again. There’s plenty of repetition, but it’s a deceptively complex work, full of tiny details and bursts of what Wong acutely terms <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18434-dustin-wong-meditation-of-ecstatic-energy/"">“ecstatic energy.”</a></p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine a more different foil for Wong than Minekawa compared to the music he made alongside Molly Siegel in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5037-ponytail/"">Ponytail</a>. When stacking those aspects of his work together, <i>Savage Imagination</i> becomes the daybreak after the tortuous night before, resembling a need for tranquility after endless stretches of torn flesh and broken limbs. Minekawa’s a serene presence, helping tease out a softer side to the base rigidity of Wong’s guitar loops. On the bell-like “Dancing Venus of Aurora Clay”, the parts trigger off one another like they’re playing an extended game of tag, with Minekawa the balmy center of it all, swooping in with whoops and sighs in all the right places. At their most playful, on the beautifully cluttered “Ancient Aluminum Forest”, they weave dense layers of sound, with pops, whispers, and sighs all spinning around to the point of lightheadedness.</p>
<p>Both musicians have an acute ear for mixing fine details with light whimsy, causing <i>Savage Imagination</i> to occasionally reflect the spirit of the notoriously fastidious <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23573-bbc-radiophonic-workshop/"">BBC Radiophonic Workshop</a>, especially when sprightly analog synth noises reach prominence. There’s also a debt to the anything-goes sampling approach of '90s producers like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Brothers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Dust Brothers</a>. “Luminescent Earth Traveler” brings in distorted samples of dogs barking and twisted strings, while “She He See Feel” is all compressed handclaps with a keyboard line that would make <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2811-money-mark/"">Money Mark</a> proud. It’s Wong’s playing, laced through this record like a thick piece of thread, that positions it apart from all that, with his distinct work becoming ever more inventive with each passing record (and there are many of them). Sometimes it resembles a ping pong ball giddily bouncing back and forth at impossible speeds, passing by in a barely perceptible blur.</p>
<p>The heart of this record is divided into three parts, in a series of songs Minekawa and Wong have called their “Dimension Dive” trilogy. It’s the spiritual half-cousin to the outwardly fun hew of the rest of the album, anchored in new age drift, bringing in deliberately conflicting rhythms, working in darker strokes reminiscent of krautrock, and adding a bassier undertow toward its close. The “Dimension Dive” tracks sometimes sound like they belong on a different record altogether, although taken in the grab-bag context of <i>Savage Imagination</i> it just about works. It’s just that elsewhere there’s a more coherent flow from one change to the next—a sense of getting picked up and pulled along in the euphoric blitz of ideas that rushes from one song to the next. That surge of creativity between Minekawa and Wong is infectious at times. Hopefully this is a beginning, not an end, to their work together.</p></div>"|19737.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19737-takako-minekawa-dustin-wong-savage-imagination/|6.6|Nick Neyland

Catchy songs and videos find huge audiences instantly but quickly lose their adhesive; stars burn ultra-bright and ultra-fast. But we’re also in an era of quiet, slowly spreading hits—polished, anonymous-seeming pop songs that percolate and achieve ubiquity over many months. They take root on small blogs, find homes in cosmopolitan retail stores and overpriced fitness classes. They’re used in TV shows; they excite a cappella groups. Eventually, as if by some abstract force designed to counterbalance the internet’s star-making warp speed, some begin gradually inching up the pop charts. Songs now become full-on phenomena years after their initial recordings; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30420-icona-pop/"">Icona Pop</a>’s “I Love It” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28790-disclosure/"">Disclosure</a>’s “Latch” bubbled up forever, it seemed.</p>
<p>Another artist making such an upward crawl is Tove Nilsson, a 26-year-old Swedish singer and songwriter who goes by Tove Lo. Her résumé includes writing credits for artists like Cher Lloyd and Lea Michele from “Glee”, and she’s firmly rooted in Sweden’s current network of pop characters. In high school, she played music with Caroline Hjelt of Icona Pop (for whom she’s also written songs); she’s linked with Max Martin and production duo the Struts. After listening to her music—bruised, brightly arranged pop songs that feel grand but not excessive—it should come as no surprise that she graduated from Stockholm’s Rytmus music school, the place where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3666-robyn/"">Robyn</a> was trained.</p>
<p>Nilsson released a song called “Habits (Stay High)”, and the accompanying art showed the singer with mascara tears streaming down her face, in a photo that looked like it could have been snapped on an iPhone—about a year-and-a-half ago. It’s a big, sticky song, but not so big that it stuns your senses or numbs you into enjoyment. The single, which just recently cracked the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100, is an exclamation of lost love and self medication; it contrasts a giant hook and chorus (“I gotta stay high all the time/ To keep you off my mind”) with snappy verses filled with quietly distinct, often strange imagery: of Nilsson eating her dinner in the bathtub, getting drunken munchies, seducing dads on playgrounds.</p>
<p>This sort of color—which might feel whimsical, were the content not so dark—pops up frequently across Nilsson’s assured major-label debut, <i>Queen of the Clouds</i>. Her foibles and off-kilter perspective on heartbreak offer shape and personality to a record that might otherwise be written off as too slick or inert, or indistinguishable from a host of peers making competent, spacious, and downcast pop music. She thrives on understated contradictions and grim quirks: While her friends are dating guys who are “turning 53,” she sneers on “Like Em Young”, she says prefers younger men. She gets drunk during the day and stays that way into the night, not the other way around, she tells us on “Talking Body”, a song that turns a lustful gaze on a male partner. On that song, seemingly low stakes are given great weight, and delivered with dead seriousness: “If you love me right/ We fuck for life.” On a song called “Moments”, she resents her cushy, happy childhood, as though it’s caused her to work doubly hard in order to become an interesting artist.</p>
<p>“I can get a little drunk/ I get into all the ‘dont’'s,” Nilsson continues on that song, before delivering the kiss-off: “But on good days I am charming as fuck.” It’s this sort of disarming honesty, a coupling of self-doubt and boldness in well-phrased lyrics—not necessarily Nilsson’s great hooks—that stick in the brain while listening to <i>Queen of the Clouds</i>. In two months time, she'll join Katy Perry on an arena tour, and by then, that the majority of the audience members will most likely be quite familiar with her music—and assumedly, they'll be just as delighted to hear the odd, charismatic little asides in her songs as they will be to belt out the choruses.</p></div>"|19781.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19781-to-love-queen-of-the-clouds/|7.2|Carrie Battan

The particulars of his own story—raised in a Christian cult, a struggle with heroin addiction—are less important than the notion that music has the power to lift the downtrodden, give strength to the weak, and help anyone feeling down to carry on. One of the tensions that made his band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1826-girls/"">Girls</a> so great is that Owens always seemed like both a performer and a member of the audience; by borrowing melodies and phrases from well known pop hits, he seemed like he was listening and creating at the same time and, by extension, using his music to help both his audience and himself. Because the music faced inward <i>and</i> outward, Girls felt especially communal, and those who clicked with the band connected to something ultra personal and intimate while also feeling like members of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14870-broken-dreams-club-ep/""><i>Broken Dreams Club</i></a>.</p>
<p>Since Girls broke up, the context around Owens’ music has been in flux. His first album, <i>Lysandre</i>, was, he admitted, something he had to get out of his system, a series of themes and musical ideas that needed a home. It drew broadly from the image of the ‘70s singer-songwriter, with some baroque touches like flute and sax to signal “new direction.” If Girls was Owens’ <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5449-the-modern-lovers"">Modern Lovers</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17529-lysandre""><i>Lysandre</i></a> was his first unsteady step on his own, complete with goofy genre exercises and its own versions of “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9BkmMjgrwM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ice Cream Man</a>”, i.e. songs that sounded like they were written for children.</p>
<p><i>A New Testament</i> is much closer to the <i>idea</i> of Girls. It’s got simple songs about love and acceptance and singers steeped in gospel offer swelling background vocals that try to make these songs feel “universal”; the melodies are familiar, based on the most iconic chord progressions; there’s a notable country influence, mostly of the ’50s Bakersfield variety (“A Heart Akin the Wind” has echoes of Buck Owens), with hints of ’60s Memphis (the guitar part on “Oh My Love” is nicked from “Suspicious Minds”); song titles like “Stephen” and “Key to My Heart” have a familiar ring. At first listen, it comes over like a return to the approach that made Girls so great, but it turns out the connections are mostly on the surface.</p>
<p>Owens’ tendency to borrow from classic pop is starting to catch up with him. These songs are so neat and tidy, with every walking bassline and nifty guitar fill exactly where you’d expect it to be, it starts to feel like watching someone assemble a jigsaw puzzle, snapping one piece after another into place. His vocals stay in his most relaxed register, where he sounds halfway between singing and whispering. Where his earlier music thrived on the contrast between that hushed delivery and more demonstrative musical elements, the operative word here is control. The obsession with form combined with the careful delivery lead to an album that often feels weirdly cold and distant.</p>
<p>It’s obviously unfair to expect Owens to make music in the same vein as Girls—he’s entitled to move on, and we can choose to follow him or not. But <i>The New Testament</i> has so many parallels with his earlier band’s approach, it’s impossible to avoid the comparison. There are moments that transcend the record’s limitations, most notably the hymn-like “Stephen”, a song about the death of Owens’ young brother at age two. Though the choir vocals might be a little forced, “Stephen” works because of its specificity. It’s not so much that Owens is drawing from his own life as that he’s writing about people that <i>feel</i> real.</p>
<p>But on the record as a whole, the plug-in lyrics like “my honeybee, you’re nothing more than everything to me” and “always and forever, you’ll be dear to me” and “I’ve got so much love for you, it’s running over” seem like empty signifiers, lines chosen because they sound like they belong in songs like these. Yes, Owens once wrote the line ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukWhGXCBM6Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You've got a lovely smile/ </a><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukWhGXCBM6Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I could spend a while with that smile</a>,"" but in the context of nervy indie rock, it felt fresh and surprising. He's a unique artist who surely has more great music in him, but Owens' work will always be a balancing act, getting the shading and contrast just so; <i>The New Testament</i> feels mostly like one just-OK thing, easy to enjoy on a pass but much harder to love.</br></p></div>"|19716.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19716-christopher-owens-a-new-testament/|6.7|Mark Richardson

Sure, their 1994 debut album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19258-oasis-definitely-maybe-reissue/""><i>Definitely Maybe</i></a> had gone straight to No. 1 on the UK albums chart, and sold several million copies worldwide. But in their first true test of post-success fortitude, Oasis could no longer claim the title of biggest rock band in the land. “Roll With It,” the teaser from <i>Morning Glory</i>, was released August 14, 1995—not coincidentally, the very same day as “Country House”, the jaunty new single from their bitter rivals in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"">Blur</a> (aka the London art-school yin to Oasis’ Mancunian street-tough yang). A year’s worth of tabloid sniping between the two groups—which hit its peak/nadir when Oasis architect Noel Gallagher declared that Blur’s Damon Albarn and Alex James should “catch AIDS and die” —had effectively come down to the UK chart equivalent of an after-school fistfight. And in this case, it was Oasis who walked away licking their wounds—that week, “Country House” outsold “Roll With It” by more than 50,000 copies to take the No. 1 spot. </p>
<p>As it should’ve: “Roll With It” is nobody’s favorite Oasis song and would be hard-pressed to crack a Top 20 list of the band’s all-time best. It's a catchy enough tune, sure, but its shoulder-shrugged message of “you gotta roll with it” felt atypically blasé coming from a band that had previously endorsed <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aatEBIZHNU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-deification</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_2mWhfOhGU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">immortality</a>, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJKpUH2kJQg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shagging well-heeled medical professionals in helicopters</a>. However, for a band never encumbered by humility, the decision to go with <i>Morning Glory</i>’s weakest song was, in retrospect, Oasis’ cockiest gesture yet: They were willing to take the first strike in the so-called Battle of Britpop because they knew it was only a matter time before they’d be delivering the knockout blow.</p>
<p><i>(What’s the Story) Morning Glory? </i>would go on to sell more than twice as many copies in the UK as Blur’s contemporaneous <i>The Great Escape</i>, and, over the following two years, it served as the unofficial soundtrack to <a href=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2351/2526998419_760ca18925.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">England's imminent changing of the guard</a>. But, just as significantly, it achieved a metric of popularity that had proven so elusive to Oasis' Britpop peers: bonafide American success, with the album reaching number 4 on the <i>Billboard</i> charts and selling 3.5 million copies Stateside. (<i>The Great Escape</i>, meanwhile, languished in the lower reaches of the Top 200.) For all their unibrowed laddism and <a href=""http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/05/21/article-1020892-0153F95400000578-37_233x291.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two-fingered paparazzi salutes</a>, Oasis projected a glamorous image of Englishness that was potent enough to stoke the Cool Britannia fancies of those North American Anglophiles who make trips to specialty shoppes to load up on Dairy Milk bars, but (unlike Blur) not so colloquial as to alienate the heartland. It’s the stuff upon which <i>Austin Powers</i> franchises and <a href=""http://www.firkinpubs.com/about"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brit-themed pub-chains</a> would later be built. </p>
<p>Fortuitously arriving at the mid-point of the '90s—and representing the peak of a Britpop narrative that took root with the retro-rock renaissance of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12208-the-stone-roses/"">the Stone Roses</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2433-the-las/"">the La’s</a> five years previous—<i>(What’s the Story) Morning Glory? </i>is Oasis' absolute pinnacle. If <i>Definitely Maybe</i> presented Oasis' raw materials—’60s psychedelia, ’70s glam and punk, Madchester groove—<i>Morning Glory</i> melted down and remoulded them into a towering sound that was unmistakably their own, with those omnipresent (but never ostentatious) string-section sweeps classily dressing up the songs like ribbons on a trophy. And yet the real triumph of <i>Morning Glory</i> is measured not by the tracks that have since become karaoke classics, first-dance wedding standards, and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2uw0H-vACM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">go-to bathtub sing-alongs</a>, but the exceptional album tracks that never got a shot at certain chart supremacy—like the jet-roar jangle of “Hey Now” (for my money, the best Oasis song never to be issued as a single) and the crestfallen “Cast No Shadow”, dedicated to a then-mostly-unknown <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/145-richard-ashcroft/"">Richard Ashcroft</a> of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4475-the-verve/"">the Verve</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lyu1KKwC74"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a band that would soon reap the benefits</a> of Oasis’ American incursion. </p>
<p>Ironically, the Oasis-whetted appetite for all things English was arguably also crucial to the impending Stateside success of the Spice Girls, who would usher in a wave of preteen-targeted pop that would eventually push guitar-oriented rock acts down the charts by decade's end. And what’s most striking about listening to <i>(What’s the Story) Morning Glory? </i>today is how, at the height of their powers, Oasis seemed to be bracing for their own eventual downfall. The tone of the album is decidedly darker and more reflective than the working-class escapism of <i>Definitely Maybe</i>, be it the foreboding “it’s never gonna be the same” prophecy of opening salvo “Hello”, the title track’s white-lined dispatches from the after-party circuit, or the cigarette-lighter-illuminated comedown of “Champagne Supernova”, wherein Oasis already sound nostalgic for the idealism of their debut album. And while Noel still deals in absurdist metaphor here (how exactly does one slowly walk down the hall faster than a cannonball?), he also emerges as a more personable, sobering foil to brother Liam’s bratty swagger—not just on his showstopping star turn on “Don’t Look Back in Anger”, but also in the way his backing vocals imbue “Cast No Shadow” with a deeper sense of despair.</p>
<p>This expanded three-disc edition of <i>Morning Glory?</i>—which outfits the original album with 28  bonus tracks—shows just how much Noel was on a roll in ’95. Conventional wisdom suggests Oasis released two near-perfect rock ‘n’ roll albums before a grueling, prolonged process of diminishing returns set in. That’s not entirely true—the truth is, Oasis produced at least three albums worth of spectacular songs, it’s just the one of them was spread out over various B-sides. Fourteen of these were collected on the 1998 compilation <i>The Masterplan</i> (a.k.a. Oasis’ <i>Hatful of Hollow</i>), half of which is culled from the <i>Morning Glory</i> era and reappears here. And as any long-time fan can tell you, these castaways rank among some of the band’s finest moments: perennial encore standard “Acquiesce” is a perfect sonic manifestation of Liam and Noel’s notoriously embattled but co-dependent relationship, contrasting the former’s sneering verses with the latter’s heartfelt chorus; “Rockin’ Chair”, along with the Noel-sung ballads “Talk Tonight” and “The Masterplan”, evince a subtlety and sensitivity rarely heard on Oasis’ albums proper. And for those who prefer to savor Oasis’ easy-going melodicism minus the Wembley-toppling bombast, the cache of Noel-strummed acoustic demos included here offer lovely, low-key showcases of his songwriting savvy.  </p>
<p>Such unwavering consistency was no doubt the cornerstone of Oasis’ early success, but, in hindsight, it also factored into their subsequent stagnation. As this box set makes abundantly clear, Noel Gallagher is a master craftsman, able to construct totemic tunes with even the most modest of means. But he’s never really been one for artistry. No matter how much he professed his desire to be as big as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a>, Oasis were never concerned with the Fabs’ creative process—i.e., how they pulled from contemporary influences ranging from Dylan to Motown to Stockhausen to create truly modernist pop music—so much as their cultural omnipotence. And for a while, Oasis convinced us you could achieve the latter without bothering too much with the former: just write a stadium-sized chorus and the rest will take care of itself. (The relationship between Oasis and their idols can ultimately be measured as such: In 1968, George Harrison released the most freewheeling musical experiment of his career, <i>Wonderwall Music</i>; 27 years later, Oasis would appropriate t<span>he title and apply it to their <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hzrDeceEKc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">simplest, most universal anthem</a>.) <i>What's the Story (Morning Glory)</i> thrust Oasis to the top of the mountain, but left them with heads full of snow and clouded vision (while a revitalized Blur would later emerge as the band more in tune with The Beatles' adventurous spirit). In t</span>he dying moments of “Champagne Supernova”, Liam lets the song’s central question—“Where were you while we were getting high?”—hang in the air, as if to suggest the good times are already gone. And as Oasis would eventually learn, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Here_Now_(album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">getting even higher</a> won't bring them back.</p></div>"|19771.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19771-oasis-whats-the-story-morning-glory/|8.9|Stuart Berman

In 2013, when he was still two years away from the legal drinking age that his show's attendees were at, rising NYC phenom Bishop Nehru shared a bill with MF DOOM in London's renowned 100 Club. Nehru had already seized on the opportunity to rhyme over a DOOM beat the previous year on his early release <i>Nehruvia: the Mixtape</i> with his track ""Lemon Grass"". Even more fittingly, he opened the mix with an interview clip of DOOM venting about the state of the hip-hop industry, one that could've been recorded any time in the last ten years and still more or less held true.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With Nehru operating as an East Coast classicist-minded MC with a '94 revivalist mindset that rivals <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30517-joey-bada/"">Joey Bada$$</a>, forging a relationship with DOOM should have solidified his status as a strong young talent. But <i>NehruvianDOOM</i> sounds more like the work of an MC with a little while longer to go and a producer who's sounded more inspired in the past (even in exile). Even at only eight tracks—nine if you count the intro—Nehru's presence starts to tread water, a technically sound voice with solid lyrical structure that isn't quite there yet as far as bringing a unique perspective is concerned.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">To be fair, harshing on a teenage rapper still finding his voice is like griping that <i>I Was Made to Love Her </i>is a weaker album than <i>Innervisions</i>. It's easier to shrug at what DOOM brings to the table, actually; his role on this record, touted as the first full-length production job by DOOM since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2298-king-geedorah/"">King Geedorah</a>'s 2003 album <i>Take Me to Your Leader</i>, is largely relegated to unearthing some of the more underused stuff from his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15114-special-herbs-the-box-set-vol-0-9/""><i>Special Herbs</i></a> archives. It still bumps, just in a way that a lot of hardcore heads have likely heard before, all blurry soul-jazz and punch-drunk underquantized drums. DOOM's verses, rare as they are, also still show glimmers of the off-the-cuff-sounding, truism-tweaking conversational punchlines that made him so appealing throughout the '00s—but they mostly come across as autopilot or hook-duty versions of his usual self, with the occasional contemporary reference (like a missing Malaysian airplane joke in ""Disastrous"") held up like a newspaper headline in a proof of life hostage photo.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So Nehru's shortcomings are easier to forgive, even if the best you can say about him at this point is that he's lucky to be one of those rare high-school age artists who doesn't let his own naiveté get the best of him. He maintains a solid balance between conceptual wordplay, philosophical musings, and internal rhymes, but it's not quite well-traveled enough to possess a real authority. Which makes sense, in that he's still figuring shit out; a line like ""Am I being idolized, or am I a pair of idle eyes"" in ""Om"" or the frustrated come-up aspirations of ""So Alone"" touch on a nerve of creative-teenager introspection. Those lines are delivered with more finesse than personality, a flat-voiced series of monologues that have their share of nod-worthy internal rhymes but still need refining into a style that outgrows its influences. The number of recent artists who've done that by the time they hit 18 can be counted on one hand, so it's still worth following Nehru's development just to see where he takes his style. But in the meantime, this generation-crossing collaboration feels like a record lodged in a sort of chronological rut, one where a young artist fronts an old-sounding record that sounds like it could've been released at any point in his lifetime—and helmed by any number of MCs that could've sounded like him.</span></p></div>"|19809.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19809-nehruviandoom-nehruviandoom/|5.6|Nate Patrin

This wasn’t a case of laziness, however—they really did sound like a group celebrating the fuzzed-out golden age of college radio. Guitarist Jerome Watson <a href=""http://www.deadjournalist.com/DJdc/2013/03/13/exclusive-interview-the-history-of-apple-pie/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told DeadJournalist.com </a>that they “never intentionally copied or referenced anything, it’s just come from whatever we’ve been listening to and what moods we’re in while we’re demoing,” but in other interviews, he and his bandmates referenced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"">Pixies</a> as influences—perhaps not coincidentally, the type of acts they often get compared to. Save for a new bassist, second outing <i>Feel Something</i> offers no major changes from their first outing, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4990-the-horrors/"">the Horrors</a>' Joshua Third returning for production duties; the record's an occasionally solid listen that comes across as pleasant and nothing more.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Granted, the History Of Apple Pie are hardly the only group borrowing liberally from the '90s two decades later—but in 2014, artists such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30832-parquet-courts"">Parquet Courts</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30542-white-lung/"">White Lung</a> have taken heavy cues from the same time period in winning fashion, convincing listeners that old sounds can sound urgent. <i>Feel Something</i>, meanwhile, sounds knotted to the past, with many of these songs sticking to a vague, shoegaze-y noise pop formula. “Don’t You Wanna Be Mine” is all feedback-dipped strumming and lead singer Stephanie Min’s vocals, which building up to a distorted guitar hook; the squalling “Special Girl” and somewhat zippier “Ordinary Boy” follow the same formula, and piano plonks on “Tame” aren’t enough of a change-up to set the tune's guitar solo apart from the other ones that pop up across the album.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>On </span><span><i>Feel Something,</i> </span><span>the History of Apple Pie’s decision to play it down the middle hampers them. Despite the swirling presence of shoegaze, they never let the guitars overpower Min’s lithe singing, bringing their sound closer to the “pop” side of noise pop. That’s not a bad approach, necessarily, as Min’s voice remains the most consistent element on </span><i>Feel Something</i><span>, and it provides an anchor for some great melodies—</span><span>but this approach also leaves many songs, such as the galloping “Keep Wondering”, caught weakly between two poles, and Min’s lyrics aren’t interesting enough to stand up on their own.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>So not much has changed between the History of Apple Pie’s first two albums, but </span><i>Feel Something </i><span>does lack one element that made </span><span><i>Out of View</i> </span><span>a stronger listen—namely, immediate songs that barrel forward in a way that transcends spot-the-genre mimicry. There’s nothing wrong with being influenced by the past, but it's important to make such pilfering sound fun. This record offers up a few examples—the psychedelic-edged “Jamais Vu”, the chugging “Snowball”, which also boasts the album’s best hook—that highlight the group’s knack for finding a great melody and running with it. Otherwise, </span><span><i>Feel Something</i></span><span> </span><span>is a so-so listen that never rises above the band’s influences.  <br/></span></p>

Ageism is a real thing in the music world, and that reality is made all the more tragic by the fact that so many of our best artists get better with time. Sadly, ageism is still the safest of all bigotries to harbor; the quest for the new and novel never relents, especially in music. It's ironic, then, that Gerrard <i>is </i>new and novel to most contemporary listeners; despite the fact that she’s been recording for half a century—a discography that includes historic records with Hazel Dickens, such as the duo’s Smithsonian Folkways’ anthology <i><a href=""http://www.folkways.si.edu/hazel-dickens-and-alice-gerrard/pioneering-women-of-bluegrass/music/album/smithsonian"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pioneering Women of Bluegrass</a></i>—she’s known primarily in folk and bluegrass circles. </p>
<p><i>Follow the Music</i> might change that, if ever so slightly. The album was produced by M.C. Taylor of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30386-hiss-golden-messenger/"">Hiss Golden Messenger</a>, who also plays on the record, and Brad and Phil Cook of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7129-megafaun/"">Megafaun</a> contribute, as well. These are artists whose own work, while never strictly traditional, understands and engages with the folk idiom; that engagement becomes intimate on <i>Follow the Music</i>, but it never creeps into overfamiliar territory. Taylor and the Brothers Cook mostly fade to the background, leaving Gerrard plenty of clear air and open space in which to thrive. Taylor in particular is used to working with legends: As a member of country-rock revivalists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/842-the-court-spark/"">the Court &amp; Spark</a>, he enlisted the help of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds"">the Byrds</a>’ Gene Parsons (on 2001’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1635-bless-you/"">Bless You</a></i>) and folk-rock icon <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5418-linda-thompson/"">Linda Thompson</a> (on 2004’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1636-dead-diamond-river-ep/"">Dead Diamond River</a></i>).</p>
<p>To Taylor’s credit, you barely know he’s there: <i>Follow the Music </i>is as sparse as prairie grass, even as it teems with a rich, Appalachian greenness. “Bear Me Away” glides on a twangy drone, as much of a plea for release as a surrender to eternity. The metaphysical underpinnings of the album can’t be ignored, nor should they be: this is spiritually harrowing stuff, from the eight-minute, a cappella paean to predatory lonesomeness “The Vulture” to the almost cosmic resignation of “Goodbyes”. Gerrard’s songs cast long shadows; “Wedding Dress” quivers with violin and Gerrard’s spry yet stately banjo, while her similarly arranged reworking of the standard “Boll Weevil” takes on a sinister, at times lascivious symbolism. “I seen a spider runnin' up and down the wall/ He must be going to get his ashes hauled,” she sings, and the potency of those delivered lines is enough to the ruffle the spine.</p>
<p>As strong as Gerrard’s gifts as an instrumentalist remain, it’s her voice that consumes <i>Follow the Music</i>. On the honky-tonk romp “Teardrops Falling in the Snow”, she weaves her narrative through the loping rhythm with an easy yet aching cadence, holding notes until they strain from the weightlessness. That masterful, effortless tension—not to mention her ability to veer from breezy to steely at the drop of a chord—makes the album’s title track as much of a ghostly confession as an abridged autobiography. But it’s “Foolish Lovers Waltz” that draws the ear the closest, a feather-soft shuffle in which Gerrard exhales, “Whirl, twirl, spin faster now/ They know they’ll never fall/ But the piper always plays his tune/ In the foolish lovers waltz”.

It’s also the one that should be held in highest regard by indie musicians—it features a highly stylized gothic cover, lacks anything resembling an <a href=""http://www.guitarworld.com/almighty-riff-suggestions-stimulating-musical-creativity"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Almighty Riff</a>, features drum programming from a guy from Nitzer Ebb, and shares a producer with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11921-exile-in-guyville-15th-anniversary"" target=""_blank""><i>Exile in Guyville</i></a>.<span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> And yet, Billy Corgan made an album nearly as diverse, sprawling, confounding and compelling as the diamond-selling, massively influential prog-pop masterwork </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17389-mellon-collie-and-the-infinite-sadness/"" target=""_blank"">Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</a></i><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">—w</span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">hich was the exact opposite of what he set out to do with </span><i>Adore</i><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">.</span></p>
<p>The tortuous dualities that inspired <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16059-gish-deluxe-edition-siamese-dream-deluxe-edition/"">Siamese Dream</a></i> and <i>Mellon Collie</i>—most notably, grandiose ego and bottomless self-loathing—were clearly encoded in their titles, but these qualities are harder to spot here.<span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> The title would be read for its amorous overtones and an allusion to </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince/"" target=""_blank"">Prince</a><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">’s own intimate, lovesick record, when it’s actually a homophone for “a door”</span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">—as in, a way out.</span> So the main tension here is between the album Corgan was compelled to make and the one he felt Smashing Pumpkins were compelled to make.</p>
<p>Billy Corgan <i>is</i> Smashing Pumpkins<span>—</span>it’s hard to remember the last time anyone had illusions otherwise—but the two are not synonymous. The even-numbered Pumpkins LPs in the project's discography tend to be autobiographical, and opener “To Sheila” is Corgan talking directly to the listener as someone who just experienced the loss of his mother, his marriage, and his “musical soul mate” after firing drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. During the <i>Mellon Collie</i> tour, keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin died of a heroin overdose in a hotel room with the drummer; from most accounts, due to his struggles with addiction, it could’ve just as easily have been Chamberlin. There have been Smashing Pumpkins songs like this one before<span>—</span>spare and acoustic, Corgan’s unmistakable soft-palate vocals high in the mix, proving he could actually write <i>poetic</i> lyrics rather than diary simulacra. “To Sheila” is a salvo in its own way, albeit one whose tone isn’t sustained throughout <i>Adore</i>.</p>
<p>Somewhere deep within the five bonus discs of material is a live version of “For Sheila” where the banjo is inaudible amidst orgiastic crowd noise that negates the opening lyric,“Twilight fades on blistered Avalon.” And it’s there you sense that Corgan may have had that Dark Knight feeling where he wanted to streamline his operation, but not by <i>that</i> much. He <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/19970614024604/http://www.mtv.com/news/gallery/s/wirsmashing970502.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">empathized with Batman</a> while recording “The End is the Beginning is the End” for that franchise’s very own <i>MACHINA/The Machines of God</i> (<i>Batman &amp; Robin</i>), and why not<span>—</span>we’re talking about a guy driven by childhood trauma and lifelong grudges, with no real superpowers outside of his alter ego and available weaponry. <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Corgan always took his fans into consideration, and that crowd noise may have talked him out of his</span><i> Nebraska</i><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">; how could he go there</span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> when Smashing Pumpkins were his sole means of smiting enemies both real and imagined?</span></p>
<p>But 1998 was a strange and unstable time for alt-rock superheroes<span>—</span>as hard as it is to picture in 2014, the record industry literally had more money than they knew what to do with, but the big names of years past were finding themselves crowded out by rap-metal, post-Disney pop, and hip-hop. That much hasn’t changed, and on the other side—stop me if you’ve heard this one before—a critic-instigated push for electronic musicians as the new rock stars forced actual rock stars to pay lip service to the obsolescence of guitars (more so than<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12938-pablo-honey-collectors-edition-the-bends-collectors-edition-ok-computer-collectors-edition/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""> OK Computer did</a></i>). And that’s how you got, amongst many others, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails"">Nine Inch Nails</a>’ baroque, Debussy-quoting double-album <i>The Fragil</i>e, Marilyn Manson going glam, Chris Cornell and Scott Weiland making neo-psychedelic solo records, and the closest analog to <i>Adore</i>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem"">R.E.M</a>.’s <i>Up</i>, which is also way too long, missing their original drummer, and has a rightfully loathed electro-rock single.</p>
<p>This is how we likely ended up with “Ava Adore”, the closest thing to a “rock” song that still honored Corgan’s ambitions<span>—</span>there are discernible chords, a braying chorus, and a guitar solo (albeit one that only lasts four bars). But “Ava Adore” didn’t build on the promise of “The End is the Beginning is the End” or “Eye”; rubbing elbows with Bon Harris must’ve convinced Billy Corgan that he got a little closer to Trent Reznor vibe-wise, though most people who related to Smashing Pumpkins don’t do “menacing” or “sexy”. Corgan doesn’t either<span>—</span>the song never gets as bad as its first lyric, but <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uWwvQKGjLI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the video</a> is the least sexy “sexy” alt-rock clip next to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnFKaU8H4v8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Lakini’s Juice”</a>. It somehow holds up less than the unearthed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56501-the-smashing-pumpkins-share-previously-unreleased-puff-daddy-remix-of-ava-adore"">“Puff Daddy Remix”</a>, which unsurprisingly sounds like the two never once spent time in the same room. (I mean, Corgan couldn’t handle the egos of James Iha and D’arcy, imagine how we would've gotten on with post-<i>No Way Out</i>Puffy.) <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">Nevertheless, the remix sounds like it could’ve fit next to </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puGngm04IcE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that “Kashmir” reboot</a><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> on the <i>Godzilla</i> soundtrack and while I’m not sure if that means it’s any good, it does mean it achieved exactly what it set out to do.</span><i></i></p>

<p>However, “Perfect” is how most people who love the record choose to remember <i>Adore</i>, working within the polarity established by its opening duo and revealing that Corgan had his next move already figured out two years prior.

<p>Of course, none of the above changes the simple fact that <i>Adore</i> is 73 minutes long<span>—</span>reissuing it with five bonus discs, which includes a version recorded in mono, certainly doesn't either. It’s been in regular rotation for me over the past 15 years and when I listened to <i>Adore</i> in its entirety for the purposes of this piece, it dawned on me how long it’s been since I had done that. I’m hesitant to call songs like “Annie-Dog” and “Blank Page” “filler” even though they’re rough, indistinct sketches filled with insular lyrics. They’re almost certainly meaningful songs to <i>somebody. </i>But they both arrive as comedowns on a record that certainly didn’t lack for them. It’s where Corgan wins out over Smashing Pumpkins, a show of generosity when concision would have made for a stronger record.</p>
<p>The duality of <i>Adore</i> is best demonstrated in an oft-quoted line from a 1998 MTV interview: <a href=""http://www.mtv.com/news/503262/adore-an-album-for-the-ages/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“I’m not talking to teenagers anymore</a>.” It can be seen as a cynical, preemptive strike in retrospect, Corgan realizing <i>Adore</i> wasn’t going to achieve the widespread commercial success of<i> Mellon Collie</i>and shifting the blame. <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">But this is a guy who so convincingly sang the words, </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5bznN76xRY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Time makes you bolder/ Even children get older/ And I’m getting older too”</a><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""> as if they were his own.</span> There was likely a recognition that Smashing Pumpkins fans who’ve been there since the beginning were becoming adults now, and yeah<span>, </span>I graduated from high school two weeks after<i> Adore</i> dropped, though I’m sure I truly believed that having my emotional tumult soundtrack by Smashing Pumpkins entitled me to feeling like an old soul.</p>
<p>Either way, Corgan once belted <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RumHTFUV7bA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“I’m all by myself/ As I’ve always felt”</a>, and previous Pumpkins records offered empathy towards fellow isolators in their preferred quarantine, whether it was in the clouds (<i>Gish</i>), your past (<i>Siamese Dream</i>), or your room (<i>Mellon Collie</i>). Without being overt about it, as much as this record was meant to provide “a door” for Smashing Pumpkins’ music, it was an emotional portal as well, to perhaps get outside yourself to risk loving something or someone. And that can be scary—<i>Mellon Collie</i> spoke to hyperbolic and yet safe associations developed in one’s teen years, offering, “Love solves everything” and “Love is suicide.” Love is a lot of things on the feedback-stained long walk home of “Shame”—it’s good, it’s kind, it’s drunk, it’s blind. <span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">But Corgan gives his first piece of grown man talk about how it always ends</span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">—</span><span style=""font-family: Georgia,serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;"">“You’re gonna walk alone/ You're gonna see this through/ Don't let them get to you.""

She writes psychologically acute breakup stories that show what it means to hurt, but her songs aren’t about pretending to make the right decisions—they’re about telling the truth.</p>
<p>Producer Chris Walla recorded her new album, <i>Cool Choices</i>, and he has a lot to do with its approachability. Ghetto worked with him back when she was still making achy, acoustic slowcore as part of Carissa’s Wierd. That group disbanded after releasing their third album,<i> Songs About Leaving</i>, in 2003, at which point Ben Bridwell and Mat Brooke went on to form <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/632-band-of-horses/"">Band of Horses</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5701-sera-cahoone/"">Sera Cahoone</a> went solo, and Mat Brooke went on to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5661-grand-archives/"">Grand Archives</a>. Ghetto quietly released records as S, most of them sad bedroom confessionals recorded on a four-track.</p>
<p><i>Cool Choices</i>’ narrative style is familiar: Ghetto’s last records as S were called <i>Sadstyle</i>,<i> Puking and Crying</i>, and <i>I’m Not as Good at It as You</i>; previous songs had titles like “Pathetic”, “Crushed”, and “Outro (The Agony)”. From here, opening the first line on her latest record with “This is how losers feel/ I am a loser” seems like a natural thematic progression. A blithe melancholy subsumes the entirety of this record, which is also her most accessible record to date.</p>
<p>“Like GangBusters” is a jangly, propulsive ballad the lineage of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4371-tegan-and-sara/"">Tegan and Sara</a>’s “Dark Come Soon”—a comparison that I’m wary of making, if only because Walla also produced that track. The harmonies are similarly clean—sharp arpeggios and barrel drumming drive it’s melodies— and Ghetto’s declarations of “you will not take me down” are measured like they wouldn’t feel out of place on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10476-the-con/""><i>The Con</i></a>. The effect here and throughout <i>Cool Choices</i> is that Jenn Ghetto sounds more like <i>Jenn Ghetto</i>— Walla lends the record a familiar warmth, and better production highlights lyrical gems like “I’m crazy and you’re fucked up” whenever they occur.</p>
<p>Ghetto typically writes with a balance of wry humor and sad yearning, but <i>Cool Choices</i> feels like a maturation in terms of delivery. Her voice luxuriates over Walla’s blended instrumentals with such command that you might forget how broken the lyrics really are. “It’s so hard to see you around here every day” and “I know about the girl you fucked” are words that Ghetto murmurs in the span of the same hook. Elsewhere her voice grows more assertive-—“You never did any of that/ You never said any of those things/ You never even called me back”—as if she’s finally owning a resentment that her whisper-croon could barely relay.</p>
<p>The difficulty surrounding Ghetto's vocal delivery— a sort of stylized numbness—is that when the hooks don’t catch, or when the instrumentation isn’t interesting enough, the songs are easy to forget. The second half of <i>Cool Choices</i> can’t match the first in quality or intrigue, but what makes the album as a whole worth listening to is Ghetto’s ability to burrow into a quarry of sentimental abandon and talk about what it feels like to be vulnerable. Whenever her lyrics are twee or oblique— as with the empty phrasing on “Forever Love”—that sense of intimacy is lost. The record’s higher points—“Brunch”, “Loser”, “Vampires”— stay much closer to the chest. <i>Cool Choices</i> succeeds when it feels like introspection, and that should always be enough.</p></div>"|19847.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19847-s-cool-choices/|6.4|Molly Beauchemin

First, there's all the baggage attached to Frank Herbert's <i>Dune </i>series, to which the French musician's 1979 album was meant as a kind of interpretive tribute; beyond the novels themselves, there are any number of famously star-crossed adaptations, including David Lynch's 1984 box-office bomb and Alejandro Jodorowsky's ""lost masterpiece,"" whose travails were recounted in last year's documentary <i>Jodorowsky's Dune</i>. And there's Szajner's own fantastic backstory, told so often it has become reduced to a few abstract brushstrokes: born in a cave during the Nazi occupation of France, his parents fugitive members of the French Resistance; inventor of the laser harp that helped make <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22147-jean-michel-jarre/"">Jean-Michel Jarre</a> famous (and for which Jarre took credit); light-show mastermind behind concerts for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2939-magma/"">Magma</a>, Gong, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4592-the-who/"">the Who</a>, and as such, a primogenitor for everything from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk"">Daft Punk</a>'s pyramid to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"">Skrillex</a>'s space ship; member of the (Hypothetical) Prophets, a sardonic, proto-coldwave duo anthologized on Tigersushi's 2004 compilation <i>So Young But So Cold: Underground French Music 1977 – 1983</i>.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">Given all that potential interference, a listener encountering <i>Visions of Dune</i> for the first time might be struck by how immediate it is. You don't need to have read Herbert's novels to appreciate Szajner's undulating electronic compositions. Despite titles that point to characters and themes from the novels and films—""Kwizatz Haderach"", ""Bene Gesserit"", ""Spice""—these are not narrative pieces; they're rippling abstractions as sensuous as the curves of actual dunes. Likewise, they require no visual complement to come alive. Szajner may have made his name with phantasmagorical stagecraft, but <i>Visions of Dune</i>, like the best psychedelic music, is itself a planetarium show that plays out behind closed eyelids. Chimes, bells, and zither-like glissandi add to the otherworldly ambience of its raga-like drones, meditative bass pulses, and chilly filter sweeps; open fifths and modal scales scan as vaguely Orientalist, like the Middle East via Mars, while all the rising and falling frequencies feel like metonyms for the cyclical nature of nature itself. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Structurally, the album alternates between multi-song suites, like the seamless five-song stretch from the opening ""Dune"" through ""Bene Gesserit"", and discrete tracks that take a given idea—a pearly guitar tone, a contrapuntal tangle like a wrought-iron bar puzzle, a pitch-bend fugue—and tease it out to its frayed ends. He's assisted in places by Gong bassist Hanny Rowe, Magma's Klaus Blasquiz and Clement Bailly, the British guitarist Colin Swinburne, and Fondation's Anannka Raghel, who's given the manly-robot treatment on the ominous ""Kwizatz Haderach"", though their contributions are generally submerged within the music's tape-collaged ebb and flow. Structured largely around the movements of arpeggiated synthesizers, the music bears comparison to contemporaneous work of ""cosmic"" synth wizards like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a>, Klaus Schulze, and Edgar Froese, though it's also refreshingly free of some of their kitschier excesses. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The proto-post-punk ""Harkonnen"", a dissonant tangle of gnarled electric bass and flangers on the fritz, offers a glimpse of Szajner's later coldwave phase. ""Ibad,"" a kind of new age proto-techno, is preceded by ""Gom Jabbar"", an 85-second miniature of queasy tones that fall like flakes of mica, and on ""Fremen"", <i>Pac-Man</i> death spirals morph into a surprisingly funky drums-and-synth jam in 17/4 time (if I'm counting correctly). Even further afield, ""Duke"" and ""Spice"" sound uncharacteristically digital for a product of the '70s, and bewilderingly nonlinear even today. With their demonic choirs, glassy sheen, and weird compression, like a jet engine in a teacup, they reveal themselves as distant antecedents of a present-day artist like <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/t-c-f"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TCF</a>, he of the unholy blur and apocalyptic affect. </p>
<p class=""p1"">As it turns out, both of those cuts, while recorded at the same time as the rest, were left off the 1979 release; apparently someone at Pathé Marconi, the parent company behind the Sonopresse label, deemed them too ""futuristic."" Perhaps they were right, given how jaw-droppingly out there they sound even now, 35 years later. As both Lynch and Jodorowsky could probably attest, it wouldn't be a <i>Dune </i>project without something getting left on the cutting-room floor. Fortunately for us, Szajner's unique approach to folding space has at last been revealed in its entirety, and it doesn't seem to have aged a day.</p></div>"|19616.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19616-z-visions-of-dune/|7.7|Philip Sherburne

On the stellar and small <i>Electric Ursa</i>, her third album but first to be widely distributed, the Kentucky singer lets prepositions hang with no object, tucks nouns into vivid verb-less clusters, and prefers pronouns that linger with little clear meaning. <i>Electric Ursa</i> includes only eight tracks, but still, Shelley foregoes lyrics altogether on the mid-album dream, “Remedios”. Instead, she hums a simple melody over banjo, piano and gathering drums, as though she were singing a child to sleep with the help of a rural chamber ensemble. </p>
<p>“There’s so much I’m longing to say, but there’s nothing to decide,” she offers during the hypnotic sway of the love song “Long Way to Night”, as if to apologize for the impressionistic shape of her own words. No condolences are required, really: Shelley’s primary instrument carries both the grain of a wizened Appalachian lifer and the maneuverability of a young torch singer. Paired with a simpatico band of Louisville musicians, her tone gives the words more meaning and weight than additional details or complete sentences ever could. Shelley’s voice fills the space between her pen’s lines.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Shelley recorded <a href=""http://joanshelley.bandcamp.com/album/maiden-radio"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a pair of albums with Maiden Radio</a>, a string trio with fellow Kentucky singers Cheyenne Marie Mize and Julia Purcell. They largely covered antiquated American ballads, country tunes, and lullabies, mixing in the occasional original or contemporary number to avoid any old-time novelty pratfall. The tunes of <i>Electric Ursa</i> indeed verify a musical education rich with various transcontinental folk renaissances. “River Low” feels like a letter for back home from a mountain pioneer, confessing both loyalty through love and personal growth. “There’s a calmness in my footsteps, in the new lines on my hands,” she sings with welcome resolve. The closer and title track, meanwhile, shakes with the same bucolic reverie of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"">Nick Drake</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/575-vashti-bunyan/"">Vashti Bunyan</a>, Shelley linking images of “waning autumn light” and “moments given unto the ether” with a see-saw dynamic that makes you lean in close to records like <i>Pink Moon</i>. Her voice rises into sudden, stainless near-shouts and then slinks back toward a whisper. Beneath it, the rippling acoustic guitar of labelmate Nathan Salsburg affords the simple instrument-and-voice affair the ornate elegance of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5191-pentangle/"">Pentangle</a>.</p>
<p>But the respective placement of these songs at the album’s middle and then at its end feels like a subtle and deliberate revelation. It’s as though Shelley is reminding the listener of her foundation—that is, centuries of Anglo-American songbooks—only <i>after </i>offering a tour of the grand designs it can support. Collectively, those other songs put Shelley in the surprising, esteemed company of recent stateside singers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27920-sharon-van-etten/"">Sharon Van Etten</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5976-justin-vernon/"">Justin Vernon</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29064-angel-olsen/"">Angel Olsen</a>, songwriters who use modest observations as the basis for big and bold arrangements. When Shelley nests her voice inside of <i>Electric Ursa</i>’s more complicated productions, she stuns. “Something Small” begins as a simple acoustic trickle, with drums obediently echoing the strums. It builds one piece at a time, the music mirroring Shelley’s slow, steady feeling of being trapped by provincialism, loneliness and fate. “It’s all laid out in front for you to take it,” she sings in the closing chorus, organ pouring in like a wave of unexpected encouragement. The record’s peak, “First of August”, scans as the more mature flipside to a single from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10709-for-emma-forever-ago/""><i>For Emma, Forever Ago</i></a>, the singer suddenly capable of restraint in the face of complete emotional resignation. Of all <i>Electric Ursa</i>’s songs, “First of August” is the most lyrically elusive, with seasons that seem to obey no calendar, a subject that seems decisively indecisive, and an idiosyncratic style that cuts between hillside patois and sophisticated English. But Shelley and the band—all moping drums, crying keys, hand-wringing electric—make the mix of regret, longing and hope tucked into the lines perfectly clear. The feeling is complete and engrossing, even if the words are not.</p>
<p><i>Electric Ursa</i> isn’t Shelley’s debut, but it is her absolute arrival. <a href=""http://www.olkentuck.com/artists/joanshelley"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">On 2012’s <i>Ginko</i></a>, issued by the Ol Kentuck label of longtime collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27281-daniel-martin-moore/"">Daniel Martin Moore</a>, Shelley worked for similar grandeur. But it felt stiff and forced, as though she had an idea of how she wanted to sound but not the experiences she needed to power it. In the interim, though, something seems to have softened and shifted for Shelley, making her less concerned with the perfection of these productions (there is, more often than not, a ripple of room noise and tape hiss in these songs) than their power. Again, it’s an arc and approach not unlike Van Etten’s, where two relatively minor albums preceded a sudden revelation. Where <i>Ginko </i>was too conscious and precious, <i>Eletric Ursa</i> suggests that Shelley is revealing bits and scraps from private journals, leaving out details to protect or piss off the guilty. Sounds like folk music, after all.</p></div>"|19828.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19828-joan-shelley-electric-ursa/|7.9|Grayson Haver Currin

She might as well be singing about doom itself. Innovators in the genre abound at the moment, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30107-pallbearer/"">Pallbearer</a> being the most conspicuous, but doom on the whole doesn’t want or need the pitiful upswing of progress. Rot is eternal and slow; so, therefore, is doom. Traditionalists to their decomposed cores, Plotkin and the rest of Witch Mountain don’t bring many fresh ideas or novel elements to <i>Mobile of Angels</i>. It would be a mistake, though, to assume the album is anything less than a passionate exploration of doom’s horror and power. The meat may be old, but it makes for some stunning mummification.</p>
<p>“Psycho Animundi” couldn’t be more orthodox in its embrace of doom’s monstrous sloth. Guitarist Rob Wrong unspools riffs as if they were lengths of transatlantic cable; vast and cumbersome, they weigh tons, yet they sink with grace. Plotkin’s voice is bluesy and smoky, but it doesn’t necessarily flow. There’s nothing smooth about her phrasing, a staccato cadence that’s as apt to induce panic attacks as it is to lull. That nerve-numbed anxiety gives way to an airier passage full of dust and shadows, not so much a breakdown as a drift-off. “Your Corrupt Ways (Sour the Hymn)” is cut from the same cloth. But where “Psycho Animundi” circles melody without succumbing to it, “Your Corrupt Ways” summons Plotkin’s full command of soulful hooks and acidic sweetness. Wrong’s solos are just as sinuous, but more subtle; rather than vying with Plotkin for attention, they enter into a dialogue with the vocals, a hissing, whispering negotiation that evokes the tone of a fireside chat with the Devil. </p>
<p>Of <i>Mobile of Angel</i>’s five lengthy songs, its title track is the shortest—and also the strangest. A three-and-a-half-minute canticle for organs and voice, it swirls in a spiral of unholy reverberation and corroded faith. “Waking brings no comfort”, warns Plotkin; neither does the song, despite it being a respite from the guitar-compacted mass of the rest of the album. That density reaches its peak on “Can’t Settle”. The song sums up and effortlessly perfects everything Witch Mountain has been shooting for since 2011’s <i>South of Salem</i>, the group’s first album after Plotkin’s recruitment: It’s a voyage into lightless depths of confusion and despair, classically tuneful yet uncompromisingly stark, in which Plotkin cries, “Turn off my heart/ Turn off my mind” while harrowingly amplifying both. It’s also a showcase for Plotkin’s range: throughout “Can’t Settle”, she hits sludge-trawling grunts on par with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABhH2p1r7Hw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">13</a>’s Alicia Morgan alongside piercing wails worthy of Heart’s Nancy Wilson. Plotkin is a traditionalist, but she defines those traditions on her own terms.</p>
<p>As modestly masterful as <i>Mobile of Angels</i> is, it comes with a bitter aftertaste. Plotkin <a href=""http://www.revolvermag.com/news/frontwoman-uta-plotkin-to-leave-witch-mountain-after-release-of-new-album-mobile-of-angels.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently announced</a> her departure from the group, and while it appears to be on good terms, it’s a blow to a longstanding band that didn’t truly catch fire until Plotkin joined in 2009. Her next musical move, as well as Witch Mountain’s, can only be guessed at; whatever they turn out to be, <i>Mobile of Angels</i> will stand as a crumbling monument to their way of making doom feel both ancient and new. If there’s one positive message that can be drawn from the album’s heart-pressing heaviness, it’s that life doesn’t spring from death itself, but from the silent, gradual putrefaction that follows. “You’ve turned around, shut down/ Without a goodbye, without making a sound”, Plotkin sings on “The Shape Truth Takes”, her layered, partsong-like harmonies swimming through a drizzle of doom at its most delicate. To her credit, she’s leaving Witch Mountain not only with a goodbye, but with a cruelly beautiful one.</p></div>"|19785.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19785-witch-mountain-mobile-of-angels/|7.6|Jason Heller

At his main act’s creative peak, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3961-the-strokes/"">the Strokes</a> frontman had a confounding, emotionally distant aura. A <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-strokes-elegantly-wasted-20031113"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">notorious <i>Rolling Stone</i> profile from 2003</a>—right around the time of the excellent, second-verse-same-as-the-first sophomore effort <i>Room on Fire</i>—portrayed him as a contradictory, besotted rascal, as he unleashed invectives against Pringles, haggled with a bootleg CD vendor over a Radiohead album, and repeatedly kissed journalist Neil Strauss on the neck before drunkenly commandeering an abandoned wheelchair. </p>
<p class=""p1"">“I just don’t have anything deep to say...I’ve got nothing to hide,” he claimed in what Strauss referred to as “the worst interview ever,” and by the time the Strokes put out the career-deflating 2006 record <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7539-first-impressions-of-earth/""><i>First Impressions of Earth</i></a>, he was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xms9QGn46Wo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">committing the sentiment to tape</a>. In the years that followed, Casablancas sobered up and more or less faded out of view. Near the end of the '00s, he popped up with a solo album of sugary power-pop in the form of the better-than-you-remember <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13666-phrazes-for-the-young""><i>Phrazes for the Young</i></a>, <a href=""http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-q/2009/10/interview-julian-casablancas.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">citing</a> the <i>Choose Your Own Adventure</i> books as sonic inspiration; 2011 brought the Strokes’ fourth album, the curiously flat <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15230-angles/""><i>Angles</i></a>, which was written and recorded without Casablancas entering the same room as his bandmates. By the time last year’s aptly named <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17788-the-strokes-comedown-machine/""><i>Comedown Machine</i></a> saw release, the Strokes—Casablancas, especially—sounded exhausted, as mediocrity came to define the band’s second decade of existence. Instead of failing outright, the Strokes simply became boring.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Regardless of their place in the rock landscape, Casablancas and the Strokes still represent a certain level of aesthetic “cool,” at home and beyond. Many acts from the early-'00s new-rock explosion have retained a considerable level of popularity in Europe, and the Strokes themselves have <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3305-phoenix/"">a distinctly French appeal</a>. Casablancas himself reached his own Gallic <i>pièce de résistance </i>by appearing on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a>’s year-flattening musical odyssey <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18028-daft-punk-random-access-memories/""><i>Random Access Memories</i></a>, lending a soft-focus vocal to the metronomic, neon-melancholy single “Instant Crush”. </p>
<p class=""p1"">His latest musical venture, Julian Casablancas + the Voidz, is a group comprised of session musicians and alt-rock barnacles—guitarist Jeramy Gritter was a member of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgugnldIUKM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mercifully defunct, reality-show-reject outfit Whitestarr</a>—plucked from Casablancas’ current home base of Los Angeles. The best you can say about the band’s debut, <i>Tyranny</i>, is that it's the most interesting thing Casablancas has done since <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knU9gRUWCno"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">facing off against Guided by Voices on “Family Feud”</a>; it’s a record that's as adventurous as it is unlistenable, a spectacular failure that smacks of both fellow L.A. denizen and gonzo-pop misfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a>’s AM-radio abstractions and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcemhmlBg38"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” ne’er-do-well Charlie’s warped musical efforts</a>. If <i>Angles </i>and <i>Comedown Machine</i> sounded like the work of a group that was running out of steam, <i>Tyranny</i> is a record overloaded with ideas, a palette of vibrant colors swirled together until there’s nothing left but brown. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Casablancas recently told <a href=""http://www.gq.com/entertainment/music/201410/julian-casablancas?currentPage=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>GQ</i></a> that he’s optimistic about <i>Tyranny</i>’s commercial prospects, which is hilarious if you've actually heard the album. Clocking in at an endless 62 minutes—10 more than bloated <i>First Impressions of Earth</i>—with six of its 12 songs stretching well over the five-minute mark, <i>Tyranny</i> is designed to be impenetrable, a blaring monolith of excess. There are a few ideas buried in the unending screech, suggesting that Casablancas has a raw and unique creative mind, if not the compositional smarts to pull off something this dense. “Take Me in Your Army” and “Nintendo Blood” begin with gorgeous, digitized sighs, 8-bit renderings of the Strokes’ finest, most subtle melancholic moments, but the latter dissolves in an acid bath of guitar squeals and off-beat drum machines, while the former meanders towards a slow-hand guitar solo that smacks of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8hm8FACb70"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a “shredding” YouTube video</a> made specifically to mock the work of John Carpenter. “M.utally A.ssured D.estruction” packs thrash metal figures and horror movie synths into an energizing two-and-a-half minutes, while the seven-minute-plus “Father Electricity” offers a kalimba-like rhythmic backbone and, after several minutes of useless dithering, a sprightly Afro-pop melody that doubles as the record’s most pleasant surprise.</p>
<p class=""p1"">On the other end of the spectrum is “Human Sadness”, the nearly 11-minute cut released as the album’s first single, ostensibly to confound the expectations of anyone who hadn’t caught Casablancas + the Voidz’s run of incompetent festival performances over the past year. The song is essentially a modern “Bohemian Rhapsody”, if Queen’s pomp-rock classic was twice as long and had only two or three distinct musical movements. After a brief bit of twinkling ambience and a vocal sample referencing the album’s vague theme of capitalistic pitfalls, Disney strings enter alongside an ambling bass line that sounds like a Strokes song played at half-tempo. Then, the song pretty much stays there, Casablancas alternating between a bedside mumble and glass-shattering vocal histrionics as a parade of sounds—a cackling, distorted laugh, ear-bleeding guitars, video game sounds, crashing drums—piles on top of the song’s dirge-like rhythm. Intentionally or not, it plays like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyrM7GxyzGg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“The Story of Everest”</a> in musical form. </p>
<p class=""p1"">“I love being weird/ It’s so weird,” Casablancas tosses off underneath the grating motifs of “Business Dog”, and this particular line speaks volumes on <i>Tyranny</i>’s try-hard stab at eccentricity. (Good luck hearing it without a lyric sheet, though: the words here are the most endearingly bonkers rantings Casablancas has ever put to tape and the album’s execrable production largely buries his vocals to the point where you can barely hear him.) “He must be on drugs” is a typical invective thrown at artists who flirt with career suicide in the way that Casablancas is doing here, but <i>Tyranny</i> is too willfully weird, too labored-sounding, too beholden to its melted-frequency artifice to be merely the product of a substance-addled mind. </p>
<p class=""p1"">As that <i>GQ </i>article highlighted, the common assumption is that Casablancas wrote the first two Strokes albums, a rock lore factoid that suggests prodigiousness from a guy who’s spent the last 15 years looking like he’s never worked a day in his life; on <i>Tyranny</i>, that guy has simply worked <i>too</i> hard, and that sense of needless toil bleeds through in every bum lick, brick-walled sound, and garbled burst of noise shoved onto the record. Maybe <i>Tyranny</i> will one day have a second life as a misunderstood cult record, but in the here and now, it sounds terrible and beyond redemption. </p></div>"|19856.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19856-julian-casablancas-the-voidz-tyranny/|4.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

Her 2009 debut EP <i>The Cocoa Butter Diaries</i> was made up of gritty, socially conscious rap that garnered comparisons to the work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1944-lauryn-hill/"">Lauryn Hill</a>; a collaborative record with French electro knuckleheads <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2223-justice/"">Justice</a> was scrapped shortly after. When she returned nearly five years later with single “Don’t Wait”, she sounded completely different, her hard-edged progressivism replaced by cracking analog warmth, extensive vocal processing, and rich, earthy tones. “Don’t Wait” made a decent-sized splash, and the song leads off her debut LP, <i>Hey Hey</i>, a record that represents an ostensible attempt to build on the song’s success.</p>
<p>“Don’t Wait” remains a supremely catchy, texturally compelling piece of music, but it also manages to encapsulates most of Mapei’s strengths and weaknesses in one four minute blast. There’s her voice, a warm and engaging instrument that sounds almost exactly like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5956-alicia-keys/"">Alicia Keys</a>; there’s her ear for space, which allows small details like backing percussive snaps and secondary piano melodies to pop instead of being swallowed. And, troublingly, there’s her tendency to lean on clunky, lazy phrasing and lyrical motifs: a line like “Let’s laugh and cry/ Until we die” combines dullness and awkward rhyming, almost grinding the song to a halt even as its positive aspects are present and in motion. Largely, <i>Hey Hey </i>continues on in this way—showcasing a pleasant voice with some interesting musical ideas, stunted by a reliance on platitudes, staid imagery, and tired themes that make it tough to get through the entire album.</p>
<p>There are certainly some lovely moments on <i>Hey Hey</i>, several of which stem from the juxtaposition of classic melodies—and Mapei’s traditionally soulful voice—with contemporary production flourishes. “As 1” is built around an inviting and familiar piano melody that’s augmented with a wide array of synth tones and bubbling rhythms; in some moments, it doesn’t sound far from the joyous and oft-zany electronic music made by Mapei’s Scandinavian neighbours in Norway. Mapei and producer Magnus Lidehäll balance their love of modern synth-pop and their classicist impulses, and position her at the front of the mix whether she’s singing or dipping into her still-dexterous rapping voice.</p>
<p>But her prominent placement at the forefront of these songs only illuminates her weak lyrical spots. “Change”, a perfectly serviceable piece of inspirational pap, is rendered completely benign where it might’ve held some personal resonance or deeper meaning; “Things You Know Nothing About”, ostensibly a stern rebuttal of a block-headed lover, is devoid of detail and stuffed with unconnected, boilerplate cliches like “I believe I was made to love,"" even as it compellingly moves from zippy, synth-flecked pulses to a funky strut. “Step Up” might be the album’s worst offender, hanging on the slack-jawed repetition of “When you gon’ step up?” and containing the immortally lousy rhyme, “You ain’t an MC, you ain’t no singer/ You and your company could get the finger.”</p>
<p>The sentiment is admirable — it’s seemingly pulled from Mapei’s own experience in the industry, and feedback she might’ve received from executives who thought her somewhere between an MC and a vocalist and unable to succeed at either — but ironically, she doesn’t yet possess the skillset to make the line truly effective. To her credit, Mapei has recognized weakness in her lyricism, going so far as to discuss it in her interviews; in a June chat with <i><a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2014/06/10/interview-mapei-change"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fader</a></i>, she noted, “I have a hard time expressing myself in English since I think in Swedish. Swedish has become my first language, so I don’t like talking to Americans that much … maybe I am going through some premature phase but I feel really down.” It’s the kind of honest self-evaluation that’ll serve her well as her career evolves; unfortunately, it’s a piece of self-criticism that consistently holds up when applied to <i>Hey Hey</i>.</p></div>"|19870.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19870-mapei-hey-hey/|4.8|Jamieson Cox

<p>The producers on <i>Highway Robbery</i> include the Jacka's frequent collaborator Jeffro and other Bay Area rap staples, like Traxamillion and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30179-young-l/"">Young L</a>; the bulk of the music is low-key, liquid, and unmistakably bluesy.  The guests that float through are on the same wavelength—Trae tha Truth on ""Just Remain"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28274-freddie-gibbs/"">Freddie Gibbs</a> on ""Cherry Pie"". On ""Write My Wrongs"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28448-cormega/"">Cormega</a> drops by, whose stern and reflective new album <i>Mega Philosophy</i> put some metaphysical weight and writerly bite behind conscious-rap scolding. These are <i>serious</i> rappers, and you don't bob your head to <i>Highway Robbery</i> so much as nod slowly, your eyes squinted from the glare of all the old-head wisdom unfurling in front of you. </p>
<p><i>Highway Robbery</i> isn't all hard-won old-man jewels, though. There are airy party tracks, too: ""Sunnah Boys"", featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5605-killer-mike/"">Killer Mike</a>, high-steps through some jazzy keyboard chords and candy-coated synths.  ""Shuckin &amp; Jivin"" is a lip-licker sex jam from Young L, and it knocks like retooled ""Mr. Me Too"" stripped for scrap. It also represents one of two appearances on the album of wild card Husalah, a human exclamation point who lends unstable energy to any song he's on. Even though <i>Highway Robbery</i> is an independent release, Free and Jacka have somehow managed to liberate a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"">Daft Punk</a> sample, and a high-profile one, for ""One More Time"", and they slow it down and pump it full of low end.</p>
<p>Freeway raps in a lower register than normal, and he sounds incredible; more importantly, he sounds palpably <i>at home</i>. As a member of the scattered early-'00s Roc-A-Fella dynasty, he has a lot of past to compete with, and he's been working gamely against the cultural tide for the last few years, trying to reinvent himself as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13930-the-stimulus-package/"">backpack rapper </a>and then as a<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19250-girl-talk-freeway-broken-ankles-ep/""> nostalgia act</a>. But here, he finds a milieu that suits him. He and Jacka trade lines with gusto and fire: ""Pray you keep my family safe/ They didn't ask to be here, they shouldn't pay for my mistakes"". The Jacka moans on ""Dunya"", ""No matter how much I smoke, the pain won't burn away."" ""My close homies turned on me for no reason, they're such traitors,"" Free seethes, adding a gut-kicker: ""My last album was only in fourteen stores.""</p>
<p>Simply put, Freeway always works best when he's got a foil, and the Jacka is his most natural partner since Beanie Sigel <a href=""http://www.tmz.com/2014/08/14/beanie-sigel-released-prison-jay-z-snoop-dogg/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">slipped sadly off the grid</a>. When you listen to him here you aren't, for the first time in years, pondering Roc-A-Fella. He's talked in interviews about being energized by the grind of artists like Jacka, who has built up a formidable mystique as a sort of Bay Area philosopher king, and frankly, Free should do three projects like this a year: the regional rap landscape is dotted with serious-minded, knotty rappers—Vic Spencer or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30216-lil-durk/"">Lil Durk</a> from Chicago, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31497-young-moe/"">Young Moe</a> from Alexandria, with whom he's worked before—who would make perfect complements. Free's hunger is a precious resource, and it's hard not to want to hear more of it in the world. </p></div>"|19743.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19743-freeway-the-jacka-highway-robbery/|7.9|Jayson Greene

With a background in classical piano, the L.A. producer who works as TOKiMONSTA is adept at doling out earworm melodies to ground even her most nebulous beats, but what makes her best tracks stand out is the ability to evoke her own freewheeling, stoner charm while wielding a heavy sonic arsenal. Her 2010 debut <i>Midnight Menu</i> was a solid example of the woozy, cosmic glitch-hop that countless West Coast DJs and producers have mined from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">Flying Lotus</a>’ near-inescapable sphere of influence—and sure enough, infectious cuts like “Gamble” and “Cheese Smoothie” injected that sound with an undeniable stomp that piqued the interest of the <a href=""http://www.brainfeedersite.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brainfeeder</a> mastermind himself, who signed Lee as the label's first female artist for her follow-up EP <i>Creature Dreams</i>.</p>
<p>Anchored by jazzy, innovative beat patterns, the dubby, refined weirdness of <i>Creature Dreams</i> proved far more compelling than last year's Haruki Murakami-inspired <i>Half Shadows</i>, her first full-length for massive dance label <a href=""http://ultramusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ultra</a>. The industry upgrade heralded a shift in Lee’s sound, broadening her distinctive bedroom beats into a grab bag of pop and disco-based hooks and meandering slow-step jams, enlisting a roster of contributing vocalists that included NYC's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28468-mndr/"">MNDR</a> and hip-hop legend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2324-kool-keith/"">Kool Keith</a> to varied success.</p>
<p>Lee’s latest, the mini-LP <i>Desiderium</i>, also serves as the launching pad for her new label Young Art. The Arama-featuring “Drive” is a chugging dance track that doesn’t do much to distance itself from its <i>Half Shadows</i> counterparts, but things improve on ""Realla"", when Lee ratchets up a fleet of distant air horns and a slow-stepping beat that offsets California vocalist Anderson Paak's mostly frivolous contribution. “Open Air” is in a similar vein with a more suitable vocal offering from fellow Californian Joyce Wrice, whose soulful pipes meet Lee’s energetic groove with more balance. Still, none of the three vocal-assisted tracks tread any ground Lee hasn’t already covered to better effect on previous EPs.</p>
<p>While <i>Desiderium</i> isn’t a particularly formidable entry in Lee’s discography, it isn’t without merit. Highlight “Dusty Stars” dances around a looped sample of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10601-aaliyah/"">Aaliyah</a>’s “Miss You” with odd, interesting time signatures and a catchily stuttering beat; “Steal My Attention” is similarly satisfying, using a repetitious chorus that recalls <i>Midnight Menu</i>’s most club-ready jams, while closer “Sakamoto’s Spring”, with a piano backing track reminiscent of the song’s eponymous Japanese composer (whom she collaborated with two years ago on a <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/ryuichi_sakamoto/odakias-otomo-mix"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">protest song</a> condemning the reopening of the Ōi nuclear power plant in Japan), is a sprightly counterpoint to some of the album’s more routine embellishments. The highlights on <i>Desiderium</i> prove that, vocal-assisted lowlights be damned, Lee’s beatmaking abilities are still considerable.</p></div>"|19858.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19858-tokimonsta-desiderium/|6.4|Eric Torres

A Canadian artist raised in a <a href=""http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/20073/1/stream-the-magical-debut-ep-from-lydia-ainsworth"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""household soundtracked by Björk, The Beatles, Nirvana, and Arvo Pärt,""</a> she taught herself the cello from the age of 10, while insisting that she's terrible at the instrument. Ainsworth nonetheless went on to study film scoring at McGill University and NYU, and landed her first feature-length credit in 2011 for Matthew Lessner's painfully self-aware escapist satire, <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Woods_(2011_film)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Woods</a></i>, which <a href=""http://www.montelomax.com/_/WOODS.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">claimed</a> to ""build upon the...contradictions of young modern day Americans."" Yet it was during these cinematic pursuits that she found a love for pop composition and vocals, and quietly began to write songs from the perspective of her diverse and disparate musical backgrounds. As such, Ainsworth is now a studied classicist with distinctly modern curiosities; her debut album, <i>Right from Real</i>, doesn't attempt to resolve its differences, but rather culls vitality from the meditative space between its opposing forces.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Because of their ties to Montreal's Arbutus Records, comparing Lydia Ainsworth with label mate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"">Grimes</a> may come quick and easy, but the two have little in common outside of a taste for electronics. <i>Right from Real</i> is orchestral pop in the vein of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/617-kate-bush/"">Kate Bush</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5108-bat-for-lashes/"">Bat for Lashes</a>, albeit from an artist who would cite a love for Meredith Monk and Giuseppe Verdi's <i>Requiem</i> in the same breath. Ainsworth isn't as experimental with regards to her songwriting approach, though, nor is she so spiritually cathartic. Much like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"">the Knife</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4590-silent-shout/""><i>Silent Shout</i></a>, <i>Right from Real</i> exists in a dusky, cobalt-hued twilight, after the real world has drawn its curtains closed and before the mystical realm starts to come alive. The music illustrates those enchanted hours in detail with soft-sweeping strings, modest electronic tinkering, pointed spates of percussion, and Ainsworth's confident, versatile self-harmonizing.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The eight-song album was released in two parts, and though each standalone EP is strong enough on its own merits, </span><i>Right from Real</i><span> only gains more impact as a full package. Early singles ""White Shadows"" and ""Malachite"" sketch out the basics of Ainsworth's musical etymology—the first of which exhibits her knack for spectral moods and string arrangements, while the latter song is darkly affecting synth-pop with an eye on the </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16211-grimes-visions/""><i>Visions</i></a><span> playbook. (Even the gloving and waacking dance moves in ""Malachite""'s </span><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNjTDxfRPQ8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>bizarre video</span></a><span> invoke the Grimes aesthetic more than something Lydia could call her own.) But the record's bottom section is where Ainsworth speaks to her true potential in a unique yet vaguely recognizable voice.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>""Moonstone"" opens the second half with an incandescent waltz, a more magnetic and creative entry point than the light, orchestral patter of early album track ""Candle""; in a way, it offers a portal into the deepest levels of </span><i>Right from Real.</i><span> The slow-swaying balladry in ""Hologram"" seems directed at the idea of desire, which Ainsworth ponders through cooed stanzas and stately piano phrases. ""PSI"" synthesizes </span><i>Right from Real</i><span>'s overarching thematic and musical elements into a gush of ardent chamber pop. For the most part, the song feels down-to-earth, and yet is unafraid to soar on the wings of powerful emotions without name or purpose, as Ainsworth sends each updraft through impressionist lyrics that zoom in on the divide which separates dreams from reality.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That said, it's still difficult to discern Ainsworth's concrete artistic identity. She's a formally trained singer, musician, and composer with an <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lydmusic/photos/pb.179092482161777.-2207520000.1411406648./649996405071380/?type=3&amp;theater"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interest</a> in Baroque <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lydmusic/photos/pb.179092482161777.-2207520000.1411406648./680876851983335/?type=3&amp;permPage=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">art</a>, who also <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/read/lydia-ainsworth-right-from-real-part-1-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">refers</a> to contemporary dance choreographers as ""genius""; she's an artist who performs her music flanked by a violinist and a cellist, but has no problem adding a <a href=""http://instagram.com/p/s1CBX-Jf2x/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">live snake</a> into her <a href=""https://twitter.com/photogmusic/status/513161984159023104"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">onstage arrangement</a>; her songs rely as much on the delicate '80s pop of Peter Gabriel's <i>So</i> as they do 19th century choral music and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OliBbjdfADQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bulgarian folk singing</a>.

Fleeced by a manager of his retirement savings between the mid-1990s and mid-'00s, he returned to the stage in 2008, 73 years old and nearly broke after four decades of hard work. The shows he played were better than they needed to be in order to get people to pay for them. At one that I saw in late 2012, he reminded me of a cat, drawing the audience in by pulling away, rolling over and showing his softer, playful side only to snap back into cool focus. It was the first time I had ever seen anyone over 70 skip, and in dress pants, no less.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, it's the kind of story you might hear in a Leonard Cohen song: the aging entertainer forced into the spotlight one last time just to make they money he's already earned, a cog in the same machine that once made him a star. ""It's their ways to detain, their ways to disgrace,"" goes a line from 1974's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYfrhnu-ATY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Singer Must Die""</a>. ""Their knee in your balls and their fist in your face/ Yes, and long live the state, by whoever it's made/ Sir, I didn't see nothing, I was just getting home late."" In other words, ""broke"" is all the thanks most singers get.</p>
<p><i>Popular Problems</i> is Cohen's second album in the past two years. As with the 2012 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16228-leonard-cohen-old-ideas/""><i>Old Ideas</i></a>, its best songs feel naked and hymn-like but are restrained by an underlying mystery—he sounds like he's telling you everything but he never actually tips his hand. The flat airhorn of a voice he used throughout the '70s has become eerily bottomless, the husk of another voice now gone.</p>
<p>Cohen is still an impossibly cool figure, singing about states of yearning and distress with the confidence of someone who knows that they—like everything—will pass. Even when he sings in the first person, he is heatless, as though watching his own failures from a distant star. ""Did I ever love you?"" he asks at one point. ""Does it really matter?"" The music behind him is a strange, sterile take on country—a form known for its certainty and wisdom, repurposed for a meditation on doubt.</p>
<p>Like all of Cohen's albums, <i>Popular Problems</i> sounds slick but slightly off-kilter, like someone trying to imitate music they've read about but never actually heard. Where an artist like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a> seemed to use music primarily as an excuse for words and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8648-van-morrison/"">Van Morrison</a> seemed distinctly to be the leader of a band, Cohen occupies a stranger space. His music over the years has been even more exploratory than his writing, changing style with the detached irreverence of a teenager breezing through her closet, from folk to lounge to ersatz disco and cabaret. The reminder here is that no matter how close Cohen seems to the truth, what he does is just another cheap show to keep the crowd entertained. Even in its starkest, most naturalistic moments, <i>Popular Problems</i> cannot—and does not want to—spare you its arsenal of perfect background singers and trumpets made of computer sounds.</p>
<p>Cohen has always had a remarkable way of making sadness sound triumphant and triumph sound sad. In a 2002 interview with <i>Spin</i>, he related a lesson he learned during his years studying Zen. ""Roshi said something nice to me one time,"" he started. ""He said that the older you get, the lonelier you become, and the deeper the love you need. Which means that this hero that you're trying to maintain as the central figure in the drama of your life—this hero is not enjoying the life of a hero. You're exerting a tremendous maintenance to keep this heroic stance available to you, and the hero is suffering defeat after defeat. And they're not heroic defeats; they're ignoble defeats. Finally, one day you say, 'Let him die—I can't invest any more in this heroic position.'"" The best songs here—""Samson in New Orleans,"" ""Born in Chains""—occupy that space: weary but optimistic, suffering but renewed.</p>
<p>Because Cohen is a thoughtful person on the edge of his 80<sup>th</sup> birthday, everyone seems to want to ask him about dying. ""Naturally those questions arise,"" he said in a 2012 press conference. ""But, you know, I like to do it with a beat."" Which implies that his answers might be simple, but they aren't. ""There is no God in heaven/ And there is no Hell below"" goes the last verse of a song on <i>Popular Problems</i> called ""Almost Like the Blues"". ""So says the great professor of all there is to know/ But I've had the invitation that a sinner can't refuse/ And it's almost like salvation; it's almost like the blues.""</p>
<p>The idea being that heaven and hell are the same thing and you don't even have to leave earth to get there. A compelling thought, but nothing to pray on. And yet the performance is so contemplative and so certain. Maybe it's the Zen, which posits that change is permanent and our only choice is to accept the moment or become just another tragedy trying to force our way uphill. Half the time, it doesn't even feel like Cohen is singing songs—he's too busy with notes. </p></div>"|19853.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19853-leonard-cohen-popular-problems/|7.6|Mike Powell

There’s a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3916-spoon/"">Spoon</a>-like consistency to his output, even on self-released experiments and one-off collaborations, like the <a href=""http://tinangelrecords.bandcamp.com/album/new-trip-on-the-old-wine-lay-it-down"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">7-inch</a> he released with Glasgow’s Trembling Bells earlier this year. Some releases work better than others, but the low points are typically few and far between.  </p>
<p>Other than his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17797-bonnie-prince-billy-dawn-mccarthy-what-the-brothers-sang/"">Everly Brothers covers record</a> with Dawn McCarthy, there hasn't been any significant promotional push for a Bonnie “Prince” Billy album since 2009’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12859-beware/""><i>Beware</i></a>, which he <a href=""http://www.avclub.com/article/will-oldham-26498"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">addressed around that time</a>: “This kind of promotional thing destroys a lot of the excitement of making records.” So it's entirely possible that some listeners were unaware of last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18650-bonnie-prince-billy-bonnie-prince-billy/"">self-titled, self-released record</a>, as well as this follow-up, <i>Singer's Grave a Sea of Tongues</i>—and that’s OK with Oldham, apparently. His job is to make music, and if you want it, you’ll have to periodically check in and go get it.</p>
<p>The one bit of PR for this new album, other than a convoluted album bio (sample: “A sea of tongues boils forth, mountains spurting forth from the magma”) is a 17-minute fictitious <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUDLmRifMUk&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with “Q101”, in which a hostile, humorous, mostly nonsensical Oldham harasses an interviewer as the poor deejay tries in vain to get some info about the album for the station’s “exclusive premiere.” “Fans are going to be very happy, right?” the deejay asks. “That’s a double-edged sword,” Oldham responds in the one seemingly truthful moment.</p>
<p>The whole encounter sounds like something Oldham has longed to do in a real interview for years—that is, to outlandishly subvert the promotional machine—and yet this bizarre interview’s purposeful obfuscation is itself a strategy. Saying nothing about the record ensures the songs will speak for themselves, and it’s not a bad tactic, because the hook for <i>Singer's Grave a Sea of Tongues</i> isn't a very exciting one. Nine of the 11 songs are reworked versions of songs from the 2011 release <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15886-wolfroy-goes-to-town/""><i>Wolfroy Goes to Town</i></a> along with that record’s accompanying b-sides, and while it’s not destined to be an essential release from Oldham’s catalog, it’s certainly not a stinker. <br/><i></i></p>
<p><i>Wolfroy</i> was a slow, stark record; guitarist and frequent collaborator Emmett Kelly is the only musician who returns on <i>Singer’s Grave</i>, and instead of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29064-angel-olsen/"">Angel Olsen</a>’s distinctive crooning, Oldham recruited gospel singers the McCrary sisters and Chris Scruggs (grandson of Earl) on mandolin and ukulele. The result is a fuller, slicker, and more ornate take on the songs, which are mostly unrecognizable from their originals—but the arrangements are still entirely in the Bonnie “Prince” Billy wheelhouse, incorporating various strains of Southern musics.</p>
<p>The pensive “New Whaling” is reincarnated here as “So Far and Here We Are”, a rollicking, riff-heavy affair that’s over two minutes shorter but doesn’t improve on the original’s eerie, call-and-response chorus. Elsewhere, the McCrary sisters add spiritual weight to “We are Unhappy”, which offsets despairing lyrics (“Nothing is better, nothing is best/ We are unhappy, we are unblessed”) with a bouncy, decidedly happy-sounding banjo. The strongest use of the sisters’ golden voices comes on “Whipped”, previously released as a b-side to <i>Wolfroy</i>’s “Time to Be Clear” and one of Oldham’s cleverest and funniest songs in recent years. “I’m quieter, tired-er, more apt to say/ ‘You go on boys, I’m good; think I’ll stay in today,’” sings a pussyfooted narrator who then passively admits: “I’ve been chosen to be whipped.” The song builds to a loud climax as the McCrary sisters double the narrator and revel in the admission, “I’m in love, and I am absolutely whipped!” before quieting down again. “I’ll hoop and holler,” Oldham sings. “If I’m allowed.”</p>
<p>Only two songs on <i>Singer’s Grave</i> aren’t retreads: “New Black Rich (Tusks)”—a comparatively sparse tune set apart by Scruggs’ mandolin and a short, devastatingly beautiful fiddle solo by Billy Contreras—and closing track “Sailor’s Grave a Sea of Sheep”. The latter has a strikingly similar mood and melody to <i>Wolfroy</i>’s “Black Captain”, a eulogy from a sailor to his reviled but misunderstood commanding officer who’s about to meet his end. “What power he has, only I know/ Now I have let my captain go,” the sailor sang on the chorus. A similar scene plays out on “Sailor’s Grave a Sea of Sheep”, this time from the perspective of a man who sounds much like that doomed captain. “My intentions were pure even when I am sure they felt riddled with evil imposing,” he sings, then comforts his former protégé: “It’s ok, this is done, let it be so/ And now you can let me go.”</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Oldham has mined his own material for inspiration: 2004 saw the release of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/702-greatest-palace-music/"">Bonnie “Prince” Billy <i>Sings Greatest Palace Music</i></a>, and the 2012 EP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16855-now-heres-my-plan-ep/""><i>Now Here’s My Plan</i></a> featured new takes on songs plucked from his last ten years of releases. On <i>Singer’s Grave</i>, Oldham tweaks the lyrics and song titles here and there to fit these new, peppier arrangements, but he doesn’t appear to be making any grand artistic statement in these re-dos other than making it clear, again, that he can reinvent himself and his songs in any way he so chooses.</p></div>"|19844.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19844-bonnie-prince-billy-singers-grave-a-sea-of-tongues/|6.9|Joel Oliphint

His general shtick is an approximation of contemporary swag-rap that comes across as a mixture of tribute and parody; he initially attracted notice as a kind of musical meme. Indeed, it’s hard to imagine Lean gaining an audience without visuals, and the video for ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrQWhFysPKY#t=72"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ginseng Strip 2002</a>"" exemplifies his approach: the baby-faced rapper dons his now-trademark bucket hat and a bad Southern accent, shouting out <a href=""http://makaveli.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Makaveli</a> within the clip's opening seconds. His verses are stilted, his movements awkward; he resembles a rap-obsessed misfit from a summer camp who freestyles poorly and doesn’t worry about distinguishing between the positive and negative attention he's receiving. And Lean receives plenty of both: the video has over 2.6 million views, and fans and haters still lob pejoratives at each other in the comments section to this day.</p>
<p>On last year’s <i>Unknown Death 2002</i> mixtape, Lean’s rapping was wooden but relatively easy to ignore, and those who found themselves responding in earnest to his music may have been attracted to the cloudy instrumentals provided by producers such as Yung Gud and Yung Sherman. On the trance-like “Gatorade”, Lean’s voice was screwed up and down the register so often that he simply became part of an appealingly chaotic mix; “Lemonade” was a blatant <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"">Clams Casino</a> rip-off, but the imitation was accurate enough to capture that producer’s appeal. </p>
<p>As a whole, Yung Lean wields the appeal of a charming reality star: he's ridiculous without knowing it. His new album, <i>Unknown Memory</i>, is reminiscent of the second season of ""Jersey Shore""<i>, </i>where it slowly became clear that the cast was in on the joke. The record finds Yung Lean doubling down on every part of his personality that hit home with those initially drawn to his music, while simultaneously scrubbing away the most amateurish (and most likable) parts of his sound.</p>
<p>He’s added two notable tricks to his arsenal: a bastardized form of dub, and a heightened tendency to eschew rapping altogether in favor of Auto-Tuned wailing. This latter development flatters the fidelity of his music—one can easily imagine a track from <i>Unknown Memory </i>passing by anonymously in a public space—but it also makes many of these songs indistinguishable from one another. Consequently, it's harder to ignore Yung Lean's vocals to focus on his more palatable beats; “Sunrise Angel” and “Yoshi City” are relatively interesting production-wise, but Lean’s voice is too high in the mix. His revamped flow, which cements him as a terrible rapper rather than someone who doesn't know how to rap, comes across as more grating than his older, more fruitless attempts at piecing verses together. T<span>he most engaging song here, the Travis Scott-featuring “Ghosttown”, might have been more potent if Yung Lean didn't appear on it at all.</span></p>
<p>One of Lean’s noteworthy qualities has always been his expression of sad feelings, and on <i>Unknown Memory</i> that tendency is kicked into overdrive. On the hook of “Yoshi City”, he refers to himself as a “lonely cloud”; on “Monster”, over the same brassy synths and a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30305-tnght/"">TNGHT</a>-like build, he laments “nothing matters anymore.” “Leanworld” finds the rapper reaching the nadir of this expression—it’s a swampy, soupy production, almost unimaginably irritating in the club-land fantasy it conjures up. These sentiments feel like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/ordinary-machines/9440-pretty-when-you-cry/"">performative sadness</a> that’s been explored with much more sophistication by artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"">Lana Del Rey</a>; in comparison, Yung Lean’s expression sounds empty.</p>
<p>Yung Lean's tendencies to randomly emote and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6qk1AFH9Y4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">stunt</a> come in part from approximating the real emotions of the music he takes his cues from—mostly, Southern and West Coast rap ranging from the sad robotics of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a> to the anything-goes ethos of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"">Lil B</a>. But he never shows any real emotional investment in the style he’s chosen, and his lyrics and tone don’t reveal much personality beyond “rap fan.” Yung Lean isn’t bringing anything new to rap; instead, he’s making cheap copies of his actual role models, and in doing so he removes the humanity of the rappers he’s imitating, creating unwitting caricatures of those artists and not much more.</p></div>"|19827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19827-yung-lean-unknown-memory/|3.6|Jonah Bromwich

But we are governed by an exploitative economic system which is keeping this from happening”. So states <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"">Stereolab</a>’s Laetitia Sadier—in her native French—in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnvjMTFzkf4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Manifest”</a>, a track from <i>We Are Divine</i>, the debut album by her latest outfit <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/littletornados"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Little Tornados</a>. It’s far from her first extracurricular project; she previously played in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2807-monade/"">Monade</a>, and she’s also just released her third solo album, <i>Something Shines</i>. Regardless of how these various projects have been played, produced, packaged, and presented over the years, Sadier’s songs remain similar at their core, and that goes double for <i>We Are Divine</i> and <i>Something Shines</i>. Both albums are full of seemingly simple, subversively sophisticated avant-pop, with Sadier’s breathy, balmy voice as the high point. And as “Manifest” almost painfully demonstrates, both albums follow Stereolab’s tradition of unabashed leftist sloganeering. </p>
<p>In Stereolab, those slogans have always felt more abstract than literal, swirled as they are into pulsing Krautrock, bubbly yé-yé, retro-futurist exotica, and post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19423-c86/"">C86</a> jangle. But Sadier always sold her Marxist lullabies with a straight face, and if there’s one thing <i>We Are Divine </i>in particular conclusively proves, it’s that she was never even remotely joking. Little Tornados are a collective of instrumentalists formed around the core of filmmaker (and longtime Stereolab photographer) David Thayer, as well as Sadier; she’s on vocals and bass, while he handles vocals and guitar. In other words, it’s a similar group dynamic to the one Stereolab uses—only with Thayer assuming the role of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5472-tim-gane/"">Tim Gane</a>. <i>We Are Divine</i> tracks like “In the Garden”, “How Many,” and “Space Liner”, laden with jazzy chords and playful ambience, could pass for decent, latter-day Stereolab outtakes, only looser and less densely layered. But it’s the lyrics of “Manifest” that hew closest to Stereolab’s alchemy of politics and pop, only it gets the balance wrong; over bouquets of vintage synths, Sadier’s pamphleteer-level pleas for freedom, equality, and brotherhood come off as canned, regardless of how exquisitely phrased they are in French.</p>
<p><i>We Are Divine</i>, however,<i> </i>is not simply a cloned version of Stereolab; Thayer weighs in often with his distinct, low-key, mystic-bohemian ramble, and it brings a winning prog vibe to “Unicorn”; “Ben’s Boat” is a twangy, twinkling instrumental that borders on kosmische-country. The album’s definitive moment, “Have a Balloon”, is dashed and dotted with Sadier’s signature ba-ba-bas and da-da-das, with the occasional jazz-fusion fanfare on horns. The song is gorgeous, but it also gently mocks: like day-glo highlighting in a used Guy Debord textbook, the title and melody work together to magnify the Society-of-the-Spectacle message Sadier has been whispering into our ears all along.</p>
<p>Balloons aplenty can be found on <i>Something Shines, </i>too. Sadier’s third solo album smoothly continues her arc as an artist over the past three decades; like 2012’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16858-silencio/"">Silencio</a> </i>and<i> </i>2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14660-the-trip/""><i>The Trip</i></a> before it, <i>Something Shines</i> is a satellite orbiting the Stereolab home world. “Quantum Soup” remixes the same elements she’s been surrounded with for three decades: sonar synths, chanson delight, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14604-francoise-hardy/"">Françoise Hardy</a>-through-a-CB vocals. But here she impishly dissolves the glue that holds them together, until the song fades into a wash of spacious chaos. It’s the inverse of a noise breakdown, and when it all comes back together at the end, it feels less like a reinvention than a reaffirmation. During Stereolab’s prime in the 1990s, Sadier was part of one of the most exciting ensembles in music, genre notwithstanding. She doesn’t fight that overshadowing fact, but she doesn't let it slip by unchallenged, either.</p>
<p><i>Something Shines</i> abounds with warm, swaying breezes that carry with them the smell of winter. “All of the roots we grew/ We will pull out,” she warns with a lash of her tongue in “Then, I Will Love You Again”; her voice has never sounded so near, let alone so large. The stiff, sci-fi samba of “The Scene of the Lie” and “Echo Port”, on the other hand, reveals the album’s biggest weakness, and that of Sadier’s solo work as a whole: there’s no avoiding that it comes off like Stereolab with too many of its pieces missing. The chords don’t stick, the melody doesn’t hook, and the delicate, intimate strength of tracks like “Butter Side Up” wind up lost in the shuffle. The slogans pop up again, naturally; couplets like “Meanwhile the ultra-rich in all impunity/ Rots our society” are harrowingly enunciated on the eerie, semi-acoustic “Oscuridad""—but in terms of depth, they don't rise above the quality of radical bookstore bumper stickers. As ardent and inviting as <i>Something Shines</i> and <i>We Are Divine </i>both are, Sadier seems content at this point to coo to the converted.</p></div>"|19659.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19659-laetitia-sadier-little-tornados-something-shineswe-are-divine/|6.7|Jason Heller

As Arp, ex-member Alexis Georgopoulos has retained his old group's basis in krautrock and modular synthesis but has taken it in freer directions, relaxing out of Tussle's parched technicality across a string of increasingly warm, woolly and hard to categorize records. As Arp's first two efforts form a symmetrical pair, so does new EP <i>Pulsars e Quasars</i> with last year's improbable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18528-arp-more/""><i>More</i></a>.</p>
<p>On the 2007 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11353-in-light/""><i>In Light</i></a>, Arp drifted serenely among cold stars, turning to the ethereal side of Tussle's beat-driven German electronic idiom. Then, he touched down on some clement sunset shore with the grainy, glowing 2010 effort <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14606-the-soft-wave/""><i>The Soft Wave</i></a>, hooking into the neo-new-age trend of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> and <a href=""v"">Emeralds</a> with minimal arpeggio suites. (Seldom has a musician's alias been so on-the-nose as Arp's: It's like if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"">Tim Hecker</a> called himself ""Drone"" or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field"">Axel Willner</a> went by ""Loop."")</p>
<p>Having dispensed with the nocturnal and diurnal sides of that aesthetic, Arp made a startling but ultimately comprehensible lateral leap to another part of the '70s electronic pop continuum on <i>More</i>, an art-pop album in the style of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>, but more raw-boned and tattered. More omnivorous, too, with sonic touchstones spanning Tin Pan Alley, Motown, '60s garage rock, and '70s glam, all polished to one brassy consistency and decoratively etched with analog electronics.</p>
<p>Following the impeccable abstraction of its predecessor, <i>More</i>'s prominent adenoidal vocals and live instrumentation took some getting used to before you could even hear it as the same artist. But there was a sense of continuity in the hushed crackle of analog signals, sealing in the garish songs. If it had come first, <i>Pulsars e Quasars</i>, a more evenly balanced between electronic instrumentals and vocal-led songs, would have made for a less abrupt transition.</p>
<p><i>Pulsars </i>feels looser and livelier than <i>More</i>, using a pickup band rather than solo multi-tracking. On the title track, a jaunty guitar line, phased slightly green and nauseous, supports a stuffy vocal. After starting simply, the guitars gain definition and start to churn, with waves of distortion like impalpable explosions in the background, toward a cheering cherry sunburst finish. ""UHF1"" similarly begins in a metronomic place before the guitar phases start swooshing and crumpling in the far corners, pumping in a chaotic energy that cues mutations into dance-rock and heroic noise; in both songs, the instrumental melody is stickier than the faintly droll vocal intoning.</p>
<p>Though the psych-pop songs stand out, the instrumental electronic side of Arp, which gets two fine showings here, is arguably preferable. On ""Chromatiques II (Extended Mix)"", an elegant decanter of delicate periodic tones gorgeously fills and drains with morning light. Its many voices grow freer and freer, like a starchy choir gradually easing into gospel expression. Meanwhile, ""New Persuasion (Version by Le Révélateur)"" is a precise and detailed krautrock voyage, with low arpeggios tensed as if about to strike, a lurking bass like footsteps coming up behind you and a synth melody that wafts out like silver smoke on the dark.</p>
<p>There are a couple of weak spots on this EP: ""Suns"" is attention-getting as a blown-out noise intro but is not a piece you'd return to on its own, and “On Returning”, built on a loop of thickly chugging electric guitar chords, presses onward like a huge, mindless drill. It's pretty boring and one-note, but if Georgopoulos' indulgent, decadent tendencies produce the occasional dud, it seems a small price to pay for the intrigue of looking forward to what he’s going to do next.</p></div>"|19789.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19789-arp-pulsars-e-quasars-ep/|6.7|Brian Howe

Mike Hadreas, the Seattle songwriter behind the project, sings it over a spare piano, something that won't surprise people familiar with his music. The sentiment, though, is a bit unexpected: Hadreas has made a habit of writing powerful, intimate, and sometimes introverted songs that look closely at his inner life, warts and all, and at the inner lives of the people around him. These words find him peering outward.</p>
<p>The rest of the lyric finds Hadreas acknowledging the cliché, and averting his eyes: ""I can see for miles/ The same old line/ No thanks/ I decline."" What he sees is an ""Angel just above the grid/ Open, smiling, reaching,"" but he rejects it. Later he uses the line again, on the raucous ""Grid"", with the same decision to look away. At that point, though, ""There is no angel/ Above the grid."" It's been replaced by ""A diamond/ Swallowed and shit/ Then swallowed again."" He adds: ""At least we know where it's been.""<i> </i></p>
<p>All of this is important to consider because<i> Too Bright</i> is, by far, Hadreas' most extroverted album to date, a record about shattering illusions, defiantly looking away when you feel like it, and boldly staring back at those who hate you. It's also about personalizing your experience, and rejecting the clichés placed on it by outsiders. As Hadreas has explained, ""A lot of these songs are me trying to claim some power in situations that would typically depress or alienate or victimize me...I've seen faces of blank terror when I walk by. Sometimes from seemingly strong, macho dudes—somehow my presence confuses and ultimately scares them. There is a strange power to it that I've only recently begun to understand and embrace.""</p>
<p><i>Too Bright</i> follows 2012's excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16335-put-your-back-n-2-it/""><i>Put Your Back N 2 It</i></a>, a quiet record that offered variations on a central sound; sonically, Hadreas pushes things much further here. He recorded <i>Too Bright</i> with previous collaborator Ali Chant and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"">Portishead</a>'s Adrian Utley, who also played bass and synth. Additionally, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"">PJ Harvey</a> collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3251-john-parish"">John Parish</a> plays drums on a number of tracks that, fittingly, are reminiscent of fuzzed-out Harvey songs. There are still elemental, stripped-down moments, but the sound is generally denser and weirder. For the first time in Hadreas' career, he's giving equal time to the textures as he is with his words. That said, his vocals are more muscular, too, more clear and naked-sounding. His voice takes on a shape-shifting quality on <i>Too Bright</i>, sometimes warping into odd, ambient shapes; on the finger-snapping ""Fool"", his powerful falsetto sounds like it could fill a cathedral and then crack it in half.</p>
<p>""Queen"" features heavy, fuzzed bass along with synthesized vocal choirs and rhythmic oomph backing the great, cocky line, ""No family is safe, when I sashay."" The frenetic, fucked-up ""Grid"", with immense banshee howls, horns, and repetitious, burly bass is reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a> (the video, on the other hand, resembles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9474-tom-petty/"">Tom Petty</a>'s ""Don't Come Around Here No More"" as done by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie/"">David Bowie</a>'s Ziggy Stardust persona). On ""I'm a Mother"", Hadreas performs muffled, creepy falsetto that sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11745-antony-hegarty/"">Antony</a> whispering beneath a pillow. The title track is a ballad with piano and Hadreas' crystalline voice, mixing in chiming clarinet, synth washes, and escalating ghost choirs; ""Longpig"" possesses a booming '80s synth line, ricocheting handclaps, and violent burts and blooms with lines about burying meat for mama. As on <i>Put Your Back</i>, there's a sock-hop quality to many of these songs, especially the closer ""All Along"", but the structure is toyed with and flayed, shifting on a dime.</p>
<p>The approach to writing lyrics here is more elliptical and mysterious, too. There isn't the same kind of fleshed-out narrative storytelling found on previous highlights ""Mr. Peterson"" or ""Dark Parts"". These tracks often zero in on overall textures, but this doesn't mean the lyrics aren't nakedly intimate. ""I wear my body like a rotted peach/ You can have it if you handle the stink,"" he sings on ""My Body"". On ""Queen"", he tosses out and reinscribes gay stereotypes: ""Don't you know your Queen?/ Ripped, heaving/ Flowers bloom at my feet/ Don't you know your Queen?/ Cracked, peeling/ Riddled with disease.""</p>
<p>There are brilliant insights and images that reveal themselves over multiple listens. On ""Fool"", he makes a dress, lays it out on ""the couch you bought,"" then bleeds out on that couch in one version and dances in another. He finds power in being able to hold the hand of the man he loves, no longer needing to keep secrets: ""I carry their names, the secret shapes/ An aching braid around my heart/ Traced in the park, an outline I chalk."" And, as he sings on the closing track, ""All Along"", ""I don't need your love/ I don't need you to understand/ I need you to listen.""</p>
<p>He's also shifted his look to match his new sound. In the past, Hadreas donned cozy sweaters and black hoodies; on the golden cover of <i>Too Bright</i> he looks buffed and polished, and in recent videos he's wearing smart suits and designer clothes with colorful splashes of makeup. He's always had a knack for the quietly devastating; there was his basic, simply shot, romantic, and playful video for <i>Put Your Back</i>'s ""Hood"", with the beefy gay porn star Arpad Miklos (who committed suicide a year after the clip), and Hadreas and his mother climbing into a tree at the end of ""Dark Parts"", a song in part about her being molested by her grandfather. Here, he finds a way to maintain that personal feel while strutting down a board room table in high heels.</p>
<p>Hadreas' sexuality is obviously a huge part of his work, but he's above all a human—one who's spoken about battling addiction and sickness and sadness, and one who possesses the ability to write about it in a way that feels universal. A huge part of what makes the work so strong is the generous human spirit that bleeds into it, and<i> Too Bright</i> is the best example to date of the lengths he goes to confront his fears and demons. These songs feel less like songs and more like treasures, ones that fill you with power and wisdom, and as a result, <i>Too Bright</i> seems capable of resonating with, comforting, and moving anyone who's ever felt alienated, discriminated against, or ""other-ized,"" regardless of sexual orientation.</p></div>"|19798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19798-perfume-genius-too-bright/|8.5|Brandon Stosuy

And yet, with few other groups seeking to fill the hungry post-<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15149-the-king-of-limbs"" target=""_blank"">The King of Limbs</a> </i>void, it was enough to convince the Mercury Prize committee and stateside radio programmers.

If you’re surprised by Alt-J's rapid ascent, well, they are too; their sophomore effort, </span><i>This Is All Yours</i><span>,</span><i> </i><span>is the </span><a href=""https://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Peter_Principle.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peter Principle</a><span> on wax, a record that's exactly what you’d expect from a band that finds itself at the top after failing upward and has no idea what their next step is.</span></p>
<p>This sense of paralysis similarly afflicted their debut, an album praised as “schizophrenic” and “ADD”, the same misdiagnosis given to deskbound people who just happen to be bored and overstimulated. Far more muted and placid than its predecessor, <i>This Is All Yours</i> more closely resembles passive-aggressiveness. On the otherwise cottonball-electro lead single “Hunger of the Pine”, a sample from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5996-miley-cyrus/"" target=""_blank"">Miley Cyrus</a>’ “4x4” grinds awkwardly against lead singer Joe Newman. The lyric “I’m a female rebel” is a particularly juicy line of clickbait, as well as one that has nothing at all to do with anything Newman says on the rest of the song; French poet Alfred de Musset is also quoted, but unlike Cyrus, he didn’t have any choice in the matter.</p>
<p>Those are talking points on a song that otherwise would have none, but at the same time, “Hunger of the Pine”’s timeliness is unintentionally an aural thinkpiece on everything grating about Internet-era music consumption<span>—</span>performative poptimism, autoplay ads popping up in buried tabs, and a tidy narrative in which the Upworthy headline writes itself: “Alt-J Sampled Miley Cyrus and What Happened Next Will Surprise You.” <span class=""s1""><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6908-conor-oberst"">Conor Oberst</a></span> appears somewhere within the barren “Warm Foothills”, and you'll only know that if you read the credits. Oberst’s a slightly more corporeal presence on <i>This Is All Yours</i> than Dave Matthews (Newman‘s unctuous “hike up your skirt a little more” lyricism), Soul Coughing (the overbearing scare-quotes “quirkiness”), and every other piece of late-'90s college-alt from which Radiohead used to be a sanctuary.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Mallet percussion, multilingual lyrics, chesty vocal huffs, fumbled acoustics, roundabout vocal harmonies, tentative EDM dipping, Asian monasticism, ""Rule Britannia"", American gothic: they all get sucked into the vacuum of <i>This Is All Yours </i>without leaving an impression. “Intro” does what it’s supposed to, with a volley of vocal overlaps sliced and diced that reestablish Alt-J as more computer literate than their alt-rock peers but humane enough to escape the “electronic” tag. It takes about a minute and a half to get its point across, and then it goes on for twice as long, proving itself to be an introduction to <i>another</i> introduction; “Arrival in Nara” precedes “Nara”, which <i>itself</i> precedes the closer “Leaving Nara” and is even more indicative of the  glassy-eyed robo-soul to come. Ten minutes pass on <i>This Is All Yours</i> with barely a pulse—it's possibly the most deflating post-hype re-introduction since <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jjbRDSCLBk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“The Beta Band Rap”</a>—but those guys were at least<i> trying</i> to chase off the squares.</p>
<p>The facepalm rhyming arrives later on <i>This Is All Yours</i>; Alt-J are guys who bonded in their college dorm, so naturally they’ve got their own coded sex talk. During <i>An Awesome Wave</i>, Newman sang, “In your snatch fits pleasure, broom-shaped pleasure/ Deep greedy and Googling every corner"", (if you don't believe this actually happened, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npvNPORFXpc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">look it up</a>), and who knows, perhaps quoting “Every Other Freckle” will get <i>somebody</i> laid<span>: </span>the options for pick-up lines include, “Turn you inside out and lick you like a crisp packet,"" “I’m gonna bed you like a cat beds into a beanbag,” and of course, ""I want every other freckle"", the last word of which <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6101-ben-gibbard"">Ben Gibbard</a> has proven <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wrsZog8qXg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">twice</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR_VeG1XW_4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">over</a> bears the least erotic phonetics in the English language. Later on, the L-shaped block of Tetris gets namedropped, and that's to say nothing of the hook, “Are you a pusher/ Are you a puller?"" delivered in a barbershop harmony. Combined with the squawkbox honky blues of “Left Hand Free”, “Pusher” is a fair reminder that a Mercury Prize and some incompatible ideas about folk and electronic music only means you're that much closer to becoming the next <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1754-gomez/"">Gomez</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless, the issue with <i>This Is All Yours</i> has little to do with hype or unfair standards and everything to do with the album in question being really dull and tuneless—a frustrating development for those who still believe in alt-rock as an incubator for unfashionable and undeniably great bands. <i>This Is All Yours </i>is, however, interesting as a proxy for discussion about how this band has managed to achieve a level of success that’s escaped their far craftier, smarter and more accessible British peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29039-bombay-bicycle-club"">Bombay Bicycle Club</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7372-wild-beasts"">Wild Beasts</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5720-foals"">Foals</a>—basically everyone but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30622-the-1975"">the 1975</a>. To that end, it’s worth noting that <i>This Is All Yours</i> will likely take the #1 Billboard spot in the UK recently held by New Rock Revival revivalists <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32495-royal-blood"">Royal Blood</a><span>—</span>another act who's deferential to their lofty comparisons but will happily reap the benefits of alt-rock not being dead as long as bands are willing to contort themselves into familiar shapes. “The next Radiohead” remains Alt-J’s best hook, and they didn’t even come up with it.</p>

The context for this music is the digital space—that’s where the inspiration comes from, where the audience is, and how the music finds people. That’s true for a whole lot of music these days, of course, but from the name on down Software makes it explicit. <i>Remembrance</i> is the first proper release by <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/suicideyear"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Suicideyear</a>, the project of young Baton Rouge-based producer James Prudhomme, but he’s been around online for a couple of years, putting out mixtapes, remixes, and original productions for rappers. The most widely heard of these to date is his beat for “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stgrSjynPKs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hurt</a>”, for Swedish teenager Yung Lean, and it was a characteristic production: slow-to-midtempo, the brittle, rapid-fire electronic percussion fills that have come to signal “trap,” and spacey, melancholic synth lines appropriate for Lean’s “sad boy” aesthetic. Whatever else you might say about it, Suicideyear makes Internet music, work that clearly draws from the online music world’s abundance; but Prudhomme manages to put his own spin on this cluster of signifiers, finding a way to channel feelings in a distinctive way.</p>
<p>A couple of years back, Pitchfork contributor David Drake wrote a piece for Complex called <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2012/10/real-trap-sht-the-commodification-of-southern-raps-drug-fueled-subgenre"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Real Trap Sh*t? The Commodification of Southern Rap’s Drug-Fueled Subgenre""</a><i>.<a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2012/10/real-trap-sht-the-commodification-of-southern-raps-drug-fueled-subgenre"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a></i>Among other things, it grappled with how ”trap music,“ emerging from a place of violence and powerlessness, could be transformed into something safe and fashionable through the magic of cultural tourism. ""...The trap isn’t a genre, but a real place as portrayed through art,"" he wrote. ""A place with real consequences."" I thought of this when listening to <i>Remembrance</i> not because I think it comes at certain styles of rap production from an irresponsible perspective (that ship has probably sailed, anyway), but rather because Prudhomme takes very specific elements of this production, zooms in, and amplifies them until they become something else, something he can call his own. The tracks on <i>Remembrance</i> don’t sound like they’d be improved with people spitting over them, but they do connect to the emotional world of a certain kind of rap production, with chords and patterns that suggest tension, danger, and, ultimately, melancholy.</p>
<p>Which is to say that <i>Remembrance</i> is haunted by mortality, with synth drones that sometimes sound like organs bringing to mind the darkly meditative contemplation of a wake. Suicideyear combines the clean melodic lines of late-1990s IDM with the slow-burn anxiety of Zaytoven. The emotional range here runs from the stately grandeur of “Caroline” to the yearning “Hope Building A” to the dubbed-out and lonesome “Savior”, with its ghosted digital voices to the chiming “U S”, which sounds like the sort of music <a href=""http://deathwaltzrecordingcompany.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Death Waltz</a> would have rescued from an early-’80s horror film soundtrack. There’s plenty of silence, enough for each snare clap and hi-hat flicker to carve out its own space, and there’s also an appealing uniformity to the whole. <i>Remembrance</i> knows the kinds of feelings it wants to evoke and how to make that happen, making for a record that possesses a very particular mood.</p>
<p>It isn’t until the closing track that Prudhomme tips his hand, offering up a slow and gorgeous cover of<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/""> My Bloody Valentine</a>’s “When You Sleep”. This is a risky move because MBV covers can go wrong so easily, but Prudhomme finds something new in the song, an iciness and feeling of isolation that move in opposition to the warmth found on the most oceanic of albums. It’s a neat trick that also encapsulates what makes <i>Remembrance</i> such a modest but ultimately captivating record, a way of taking sounds and textures from one context and transforming them into something that feels personal and close.</p></div>"|19687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19687-suicideyear-remembrance-ep/|7.3|Mark Richardson

The Swedish band Goat works from the premise that compounding those misunderstandings can make pop even better. Their faraway small groups of choice are artists who've introduced the fuzz and wah of electric instruments into traditions that developed outside Western pop: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5199-tinariwen/"">Tinariwen</a>, the <i>Congotronics</i> crowd, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsUaRVW44fU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Khun Narin's Electric Phin Band</a>, the heavier side of the <a href=""http://www.sublimefrequencies.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sublime Frequencies</a> catalog.</p>
<p>The ingenious part of Goat's act is that they've looped those artists' sounds back into drone-rock, expanding the range of tones and rhythms that most of the bands in Spacemen 3's wake have wielded at their disposal. The less exciting part is the way that Goat have couched their open-eared virtuosity in a load of pseudo-mystical play-acting: they perform in masks that look generically ""exotic-ethnic"" but don't actually appropriate any specific cultural associations, they claim to be inspired by the vodou tradition of the northern Swedish town of Korpilombolo (population 529), and their lyrics and titles are winkingly quasi-primitivist. (One tip-off is the title of <i>Commune</i>'s ""Gathering of Ancient Tribes"": note that it's a backronym for the name of the band, and then ask yourself why it would be in English.)</p>
<p>That said, some of <i>Commune</i> is pretty splendid. It's recorded through a thick veil of reverb, which makes for an improvement on the crisper tone of their debut, the 2012 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17332-world-music/""><i>World Music</i></a>; the band's nameless singer now sounds delightfully as if she's screaming down the far end of a wind tunnel. (Goat's members still haven't revealed their identities, aside from occasional spokesperson Christian Johansson, although one of them did apparently <a href=""http://freedomspark.co.uk/interview-goat/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">convince an interviewer</a> that his name was <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2319180/Abba-star-whos-haunted-sadness-joyous-hits-JAN-MOIR-visits-worlds-Abba-museum.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Björn Ulvaeus</a>.) It's also frontloaded with two of the band's best songs to date: ""Talk to God"", a hypnotic jam built around a single fluttering guitar phrase, and ""Words"", a singleminded acid-rock stomp whose only nod to internationalism beyond <a href=""http://www.lysergia.com/LamaWorkshop/IAlabel/IAstory.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">International Artists</a> is finger cymbals.</p>
<p>Still, Goat seems to be running short on material on <i>Commune</i>. ""To Travel the Path Unknown"" and ""Bondye"" (named after a Haitian vodou god) are both undercooked instrumentals, and a few other tracks rely on one or two little riffs that repeat until not even a pedal-hopping guitar solo can keep them afloat. The band pulls it together for the closer, ""Gathering of Ancient Tribes"", another Tichumaren-inspired groove that gradually piles on on layers of instrumental texture, until it ends—as the album began—with the sound of a temple bell.</p>
<p>It's easy to understand why Goat would try to frame their music as a spiritual ritual, and there's a tradition of communal mysticism even among the European roots of what they're up to here (see, for instance, the bands that came out of the <a href=""http://www.furious.com/perfect/amonduulii.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amon Düül</a> commune). But they've also locked themselves into an act in which they have to write and dress a certain way without ever breaking character, and in which their gift for bringing together musical ideas from Mali and Lagos and Birmingham and beyond is burdened by the preposterous pretense of being an ""ancient tribe,"" and the notion of keeping that act up is the greatest hurdle they face.</p></div>"|19829.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19829-goat-commune/|7.3|Douglas Wolk

In the last five years, the Philadelphia instrumentalists have become indispensible facilitators for other people’s music—the multi-instrumentalist Ziegler as a producer and touring sound engineer for bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs/"">the War on Drugs</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31857-kurt-vile-and-the-violators/"">Kurt Vile and the Violators</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29258-purling-hiss/"">Purling Hiss</a>, the harpist Lattimore as accompanist for and improviser with a litany of rock musicians such as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3874-thurston-moore/"">Thurston Moore</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27920-sharon-van-etten/"">Sharon Van Etten</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5281-meg-baird/"">Meg Baird</a>. Their individual orbits have often overlapped, too: Lattimore, for instance, played on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15174-smoke-ring-for-my-halo/""><i>Smoke Ring for My Halo</i></a>, the Vile album that Zeigler, in part, recorded. They’ve also led their own respective recording projects, with Zeigler even helming the sessions for Lattimore’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/9112-sonic-omnivores/2/"" target=""_blank"">splendid 2013 solo debut, <i>The Withdrawing Room</i></a>.</p>
<p>Still, Lattimore and Zeigler have built their principal reputations as members of supporting casts—necessary, if not necessarily noticed—but <i>Slant of Light </i>represents the duo’s cautious move into their own distinct territory. Lattimore plucks, scrapes, and slaps her harp, running its sounds through a loop station that not only repeats her patterns but occasionally gives them a prismatic kind of echo, as though you’re watching a picture fade one color at the time. Zeigler routes an assortment of synthesizers, guitars, and melodicas through a small army of effect pedals. Inspired by their work <a href=""http://therepeater.org/avada_portfolio/mary-lattimore-jeff-zeigler-marfa-texas-volume-1/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on a live score for the 1968 French film <i>Le Révélateur</i> in Texas’ Marfa Ballroom</a>, <i>Slant of Light </i>consists of four improvisations that are surprisingly broad in focus given the duo’s limited, idiosyncratic instrumentation. They shift between new age gloamings and atonal excursions, phosphorescent crescendos and needlepoint delicacy. “Echo Sounder”, the record’s moment of complete triumph, funnels all of those approaches into one beautiful climb. Zeigler shapes an enormous, swelling hum that still leaves room for Lattimore at the top; she plays patterns and pauses, allowing his electronic whirrs to slip through the rests like a warm breeze. It’s light but not thin, distant but not unfamiliar, engrossing but not all-consuming.</p>
<p>To that last end, <i>Slant of Light</i> benefits from Lattimore and Zeigler’s respective pasts, as their ancillary work seems to have fostered a degree of modesty in their step toward the spotlight. <i>Slant of Light</i> is a slight record, its four tracks just breaking the 30-minute mark; each piece suggests a single statement, meant to express one idea before moving on to the next one. Lattimore’s <a href=""https://www.lyonhealy.com/pedal-style-30.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lyon and Healy harp has 47 strings</a>, but there's never the sense that she’s trying to show you that she knows what to do with them or the pedals they power. “The White Balloon” is a duet between Lattimore’s high-floating harp melody and Zeigler’s more mid-range guitar, which acts as a terrestrial tether to the bed of electric noise at the bottom of the track. For three minutes, they float with one another, dipping and diving through a ballet just above the din—and then they fade away, adding allure through brevity rather than overstaying their welcome.</p>
<p>Even the album's 12-minute finale, “Tomorrow is a Million”, feels brief. Together, Lattimore and Ziegler twist through beds of soft noise, with scraped and popped harp strings and splintered guitar notes clustering into alien whorls of anti-melodies. The pair’s playing is busy but not restless, moving more in mutual sympathy than selfishness. By track’s end, it’s hard not to wish it didn’t keep going, so you could see where all these quick runs and instant redirections might go if there were no limit. <i>Slant of Light</i>, then, succeeds on the level of the best improvisations. These pieces pry the audience’s eyes off the clock without taking advantage of that surrender, and perhaps that’s the valuable side effect of spending so much time learning how the music of others work—what’s too much, what’s too little, what’s just right. <i>Slant of Light</i> is a short, humble offering of the latter.   </p></div>"|19621.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19621-mary-lattimore-jeff-zeigler-slant-of-light/|7.5|Grayson Haver Currin

It’s a new album of new music recorded in the last few years, and it’s said to be the first of more to come. Unlike MBV, it’s not that James went away entirely—in 2005, he released a series of <i>Analord</i> 12"" EPs as AFX, and there were a couple of low-key EPs as the Tuss. But with many-monikered electronic musicians, branding is everything: it’s not an Aphex Twin release unless it’s presented as an Aphex Twin release.</p>
<p><i>Syro</i> is an unusual album to contemplate because its overall approach is not particularly unusual. Older fans of electronic music who followed along with James’ shape-shifting in the 1990s may need to adjust their expectations slightly. On the evidence here, he has no interest in re-inventing his sound. <i>Syro</i> has few extremes, no hyper-intense splatter-breaks or satanic “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-9UvrLyj3k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Come to Daddy</a>” vocals or rushes of noise. On the other end of the spectrum, <i>Syro</i> doesn’t cast James in a quasi-classical light; there's no “serious composer” tracks like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iiK4MgIPtI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">4</a>” or “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCSrMEsaNAM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Girl/Boy Song</a>” that beg to be arranged for string quartet. And there are no “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBS4Gi1y_nc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Windowlicker</a>”-like nods to pop, no attempts to smuggle some truly weird music onto the charts.</p>
<p>Without all that, what’s left? Sixty-five minutes of highly melodic, superbly arranged, precisely mixed, texturally varied electronic music that sounds like it could have come from no other artist. James throughout the ’90s was an influence sponge; part of his genius was how he took ideas and ran them through his highly idiosyncratic filter. The bizarro highlights came when he put his own spin on genres, making jungle weirder, pop more unsettling, and piano music more gorgeous. <i>Syro</i> also absorbs many different sounds, from loping breakbeat to drum’n’bass to techno proper to hints of disco, but in a more subtle way. It has a way of making other genres seem like they exist to serve this particular vision. And it’s a confident album precisely because it’s not self-consciously pushing the envelope. Electronic music with a strong beat not intended for the dancefloor was, if not invented by this guy, certainly perfected by him. So with his first trip back from the wilderness, he’s demonstrating exactly how it’s done.</p>
<p><i>Syro</i> scans as “’90s” in terms of form but is quite modern in its particulars. Music sounded <i>like</i> this in 1996, but it didn’t sound quite this good. Whether James has acquired better machines or improved the way in which he records them, <i>Syro</i> contains some of his most tactile music; it’s a headphone record par excellence, an hour-long feast for the ears. But as exquisite as all the fragments are in isolation, the heart of the record is its steady sense of momentum, all the more remarkable since the tempos are mostly relaxed and uniform. James has spoken of tricks he uses in sequencing to free his music from a ridged digital grid; whatever his methods, his rhythmic DNA is as identifiable as John Bonham’s. There’s a playful swing to his rhythms, with accents that dance on and around the beat, and that unmistakable drive is the frame upon which the album is built.</p>
<p>The album’s formal simplicity keeps the focus on the arrangements, especially in the first half. The ten-and-a-half-minute “XMAS_EVET10 [120][thanaton3 mix]” glides forward like a smooth stone over polished ice, allowing a new element—a sly melodic twist, a stuttering shift in the beat, an unusually bassy groan—to enter seamlessly in every bar. It’s complicated but never busy, myriad parts cohering into a logical whole. “<span id=""docs-internal-guid-bd384a25-8f96-c847-1ab0-a888e09af8e7""><span>4 bit 9d api+e+6 [126.26]</span></span>” mixes muted acid squelches with twinkly keyboard melodies, with barely-there voices intoning a few layers beneath, while the opening “minipops 67 [120.2][source field mix]” has wordless singing presented straight—the one new wrinkle on the album—and it’s so naked it’s disarming. The album gets a few clicks harsher in places, as on “CIRCLONT6A [141.98][syrobonkus mix]”, with its assertive bass grind and rubbery video game noises, but it never goes too far in that direction. The care and virtuosity with which these tracks were assembled is immediately obvious, but nothing feels difficult; the record’s easy flow despite it all is one of its primary virtues, and there’s something new to uncover with every listen.</p>
<p><i>Syro</i>’s tremendous focus on detail marks it as a more muted release in Aphex Twin’s discography. The “What the hell was that?”, once an Aphex touchstone, is nowhere to be found; there’s little here in the way of brute-force appeals to the lizard brain, and <i>Syro</i> is on balance more sophisticated and cerebral. And that silliness, that bratty desire to be noticed, was part of what made the Aphex Twin experience special. Some will miss it. But this record—virtuosic, precise, but also alive with feeling—has something else in mind. It’s telling that the most extreme moment here is also the quietest—the closing “aisatsana [102]”, a painfully lovely minimalist piano piece recorded on a creaky upright with birds chirping away in the background. By that moment, the feeling of “I’m listening to a new Aphex Twin album” has fallen away and the deeper beauty of <i>Syro</i> starts to sink in.</p></div>"|19755.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19755-aphex-twin-syro/|8.7|Mark Richardson

The half-decade anniversary collection depicted a tight-knit yet adventurous label that took the dubstep-informed foundation of Steven Goodman, aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22051-kode9/"">Kode9</a>, and built it out in every direction that the structure could feasibly hold. Five years later, the label's roster <i>and</i> house style has expanded: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19356-hyperdub-101/""><i>10.1</i></a> put forth a label canon that gave footwork, funky, and grime as much attention as the dubstep sound that put Hyperdub on the map, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19639-various-artists-hyperdub-102/""><i>10.2</i></a> made a cohesive case for UK bass music's incorporation of straight-up R&amp;B.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">So it stands to reason that the third volume focuses on another facet entirely, centered as it is around the ambient, minimalist, and experimental side that artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28822-laurel-halo/"">Laurel Halo</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32295-copeland/"">Inga Copeland</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30837-dean-blunt"">Dean Blunt</a> have successfully tapped into. Yet given the artistic depth of those names and their precursors—most notably <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">Burial</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/539-the-bug"">the Bug</a>, and Kode9 himself—it's strange that this volume of Hyperdub's 10th anniversary series is the hardest yet to love. The label's strong history with ambient and left-field music is underrated in the context of their greater role in transforming 2-step, but those experimental tendencies were always in the music, sometimes subsumed but always within reach. With the songs collected here, however, the sum of those efforts seems a bit bewildering: oddly beautiful one moment, disorienting and grating the next, and usually throbbing with some queasy undercurrent of dread that makes it hard to piece together.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The biggest sign that something's off is a deceptively simple fact: there are 23 tracks rolled out over the course of 74 minutes, and twelve of those tracks are an intermission-length two-and-a-half minutes or less. That in itself isn't a dealbreaker when it comes to ambient music—anyone who owns <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11732-music-for-films-apollo-thursday-afternoon-more-music-for-films/""><i>Music for Films </i></a>can vouch for that—but this collection of wide-ranging artists, featuring a number of tracks pulled from the context of pre-existing albums, represents Hyperdub's leftfield side with brief and sketched-out pieces (sometimes completely uncharacteristic ones, to boot) that don't go a long way to leave distinct impressions.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The more familiar of those earlier tracks, like Burial's ""In McDonalds"" and ""Night Bus"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22488-darkstar/"">Darkstar</a>'s ""Ostkreuz"", or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7288-kode9-the-spaceape/"">Kode9 &amp; the Spaceape</a>'s ""Hole in the Sky"", might stir up fond memories. But they're jumbled up and juxtaposed with so many like-minded songs riding on truncated buildups, foggy atmospherics, and beatless drones that the cumulative effect is a shivering blur. It's best to take things piece by piece, then, before reassembling again. Among the briefer selections from earlier albums, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22487-ikonika"">Ikonika</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18304-ikonika-aerotropolis/""><i>Aerotropolis</i></a> deep cut ""Completion"" finds a new lease on life and outdoes its peers by building smartly over its abbreviated space, wrapping cresting oscillations around a simple, piercing three-note refrain. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30522-cooly-g"">Cooly G</a> deserves the entry-point nod for the yearning ""Trying"", a cut that draws the more intimate side of her already tactile sound even more forward-thinking, while still featuring a rich bass-ride ambience that keeps the rhythm up front even when the sparse drums drop out.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But the new cuts demand the most attention, especially since they reveal just how wide that ambient influence has spread throughout the label. Inga Copeland's freezer-burnt ""I Am Your Ambient Wife"" rests on the other side of the scale from Cooly G's warmth, never quite resolving into shape but pulling off the sonic equivalent of simultaneously melting and crumbling. Most other tracks hit some fascinating, if occasionally impenetrable, points in between sparse beauty and anxious cacophony; Kevin Martin's double duty as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/539-the-bug/"">the Bug</a> (""Siren"") and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27867-king-midas-sound/"">King Midas Sound</a> (""Blue"") reveal that his ruffneck and introspective sides share an ear for calmly drifting chords and the tendency to push bass until it's thick enough to wrap around yourself. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31208-lee-gamble/"">Lee Gamble</a>'s ""DSM"" drifts through a simple wave of minimalist melody and canyon-reverbed wooden blocks, a calm lull that makes its last-minute bass tremors feel like an ambush; Dean Blunt's ""Urban"" is a moody juxtaposition of a restlessly pacing synth riff and a fragile sax solo that threatens to fall apart just before emerging with the prettiest moment on the whole compilation.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Aside from ""Blue"", all those compositions are of a more substantial length, which is a good thing; the more space the artists have to work within, the better the end result, even when it's the type of fare that vast majority of people who were into into the beat-focused <i>10.1 </i>and song-driven <i>10.2 </i>might recoil from. Not every track features quick brushes against ambient, and there's a lot to work with in the album's two longest cuts: the day-glo chrome cyberpunk ascent of ""Liloos Seduction"", from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22327-king-britt/"">King Britt</a>'s 2012 12"" as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32344-fhloston-paradigm/"">Fhloston Paradigm</a>, <i>Chasing Rainbows</i>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7287-jeremy-greenspan/"">Jeremy Greenspan</a>'s previously-unreleased pure wall-of-analog nightmare drone ""Gage"". Back in July, Kode9 <a href=""https://twitter.com/kodenine/status/490570082263650304"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>declared on Twitter</span></a> that ""10.3 will be the soundtrack to slitting your wrists in a warm bath of champagne,"" which accurately sums up the atmosphere of bloodstained elegance that turns a lavish scene gruesome.</p></div>"|19707.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19707-various-artists-hyperdub-103/|6.5|Nate Patrin

Obviously, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4404-u2/"">U2</a> would fall victim—you could only acquire <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19816-u2-songs-of-innocence""><i>Songs of Innocence</i></a> by doing the exact opposite of crate digging, and yet they put a damn LP on the cover anyway—and even a goofball like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29648-king-tuff/"">King Tuff</a> (aka Kyle Thomas) is not immune. “Black Holes in Stereo” is the tenth song on his new album <i>Black Moon Spell, </i>and it threatens to topple his entire garage-glam enterprise. As you might be able to tell from the title, it’s a tribute to wax for people who felt <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8v09-wlFiM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Spin the Black Circle”</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oST77VRHXt0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“45”</a> were a bit too wishy-washy. Imagine what it takes to out-earnest the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3272-pearl-jam/"">Pearl Jam</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27103-the-gaslight-anthem"">Gaslight Anthem</a>, and then see if Thomas’ lyrics do the trick: “Girls and boys come from outer space and so does music too/ I learned more workin’ at the record store than I ever did in high school.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Fortunately, he’s got a sense of humor about himself that counteracts all of that, and besides, “Black Holes in Stereo” is actually the truth<span>—</span>for him, classic rock is elementary, glam is higher education, and a masters degree is earned by trolling through the deepest recesses of garage rock obscurity. That’s the world in which King Tuff lives and thrives, where airbrushed van paintings come to life and “stoner rock” still means something Spicoli or Wooderson would listen to, not the slow and low likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30405-sleep/"">Sleep</a> or Kyuss. Likewise, there are no institutions of the square<span>—</span>and that includes school, monogamous relationships, jobs, and standards of beauty. <i>Black Moon Spell </i>lives life with a foam dome and beer-colored goggles.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This world may be Thomas' construction, but it’s real to King Tuff, and on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16667-king-tuff/"">his self-titled sophomore bow from 2012</a>, he pronounced himself as the universal rock star<span>—</span>songs like “Anthem”, “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13275-bad-things/"">Bad Thing</a>”, and “Keep On Movin’” were self-fulfilling prophecies, assumed classics delivered with a playfulness and unabashed hookiness that his more mannered peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27962-ty-segall/"">Ty Segall</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"">Thee Oh Sees</a> lack. In a way, <i>Black Moon Spell</i> makes King Tuff <i>realer</i> by continuing that narrative, as it’s a post-fame record in that sense: the tales are taller, the drugs are better, the women wilder, and there’s a conquering hero at the record's center to tell us all about it. The title track, “Rainbow's Run”, and “Eyes of the Muse” seem to be tributes to rock mythology itself, King Tuff ascending to the level of the gods before returning to let the common man in on what gets discussed up there.</p>
<p>If the stories are slightly different, for better or worse, the song remains the same. King Tuff is kind of a knucklehead, but Thomas can be a clever songwriter; the slight modulation in the title track’s <a href=""http://www.loopinsight.com/magazine/issue-9/chasing-eddie-van-halens-brown-sound/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">brown-sound</a> riff makes its very insistent repetition warranted, while “Headbanger” is a love affair between metal record collectors set to riffs that jut like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2144-iron-maiden/"">Iron Maiden</a>’s font and melted psych-rock harmonies. And though he’s more hi-fi than most in his field, <i>Black Moon Spell</i> is still all treble and midrange in a logical way<span>—</span>pre-EQ’d to sound like it’s playing in a car’s cassette deck.</p>
<p>But otherwise, if <i>Black Moon Spell</i> doesn’t instantly recall “Bad Thing” (“Beautiful Thing”) or “Keep On Movin’” (“Black Holes in Stereo”) in either structure or melody, it ends up recalling other songs on <i>Black Moon Spell</i>. Both narrower than <i>King Tuff</i> and with a longer tracklist as well, <i>Black Moon Spell</i> scraps the surprisingly lovely midtempo “ballads"" from its predecessor, which allowed a sigh of relief amidst the beer-bonging. He's too genial for the stock characterization of women on “Sick Mind” and “I Love You Ugly” to cause much alarm, though “She was born with a filthy desire/ More sex, more drugs, she can always get higher” is meant as a compliment and thus forces the issue.  Just as disappointing is Thomas’ stock characterization of himself; halfway through his third album, he sings “King Tuff is my name/ I got madness in my brain/ Pleased to meet you, I’m gonna eat you/ Cause I’m batshit insane.” It's a presentation of King Tuff for the sake of King Tuff on a record that already didn’t lack for filler.</p>
<p>On <i>King Tuff</i>’s prettiest song, Thomas sang,“ You always wanna know you’re not alone/ In the unpopular world,” a show of empathy towards the listener who hadn’t found their own personal King Tuff-style way out of being a misfit yet. He then offered some do-as-I-say <i>and</i> do-as-I-do advice: “I’m going deeper into the unusual world.” He's gone even deeper on <i>Black Moon Spell</i>, but with the release of any sort of emotional tether to Kyle Thomas, he might've left the rest of us behind.</p></div>"|19810.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19810-king-tuff-black-moon-spell/|6.4|Ian Cohen

Although they're a generation removed, Whirr's made no secret of their affinity for '90s shoegaze; their name certainly fits the bill, and their music to date has been a love letter to fluid, guitar-rich pop songs. Their 2012 debut album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16387-pipe-dreams/"">Pipe Dreams</a></i>, had more angularity and dynamism to it than 2013’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18335-whirr-around/"">Around</a> </i>EP, but the basic formula was the same: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a> circa the brain-liquefying <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16605-isnt-anything-reissue-loveless-reissue-eps-1988-1991/""><i>Isn’t Anything</i></a> mixed with the softer suffocation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4105-slowdive/"">Slowdive</a>. </p>
<p>Since then, Whirr’s frontman, singer/guitarist Nick Bassett, has put some distance between him and his past—he formerly played in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven/"">Deafheaven</a>—by forming a side project with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31634-nothing/"">Nothing</a>’s Dominic Palermo, the dreamy darkwave outfit <a href=""http://deathoflovers.bandcamp.com/releases"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Death of Lovers</a>. Bassett also began playing bass with Nothing, which makes far more sense than his stint in Deafheaven, since outside of a few randomly insert palm-mutes, Whirr’s new album, <i>Sway</i>, doesn’t have the faintest whiff of blackened riffage to it. It does parallel Nothing’s foray into spacious melody and downcast massiveness; Bassett, though, is far more of a strict traditionalist, as <i>Sway </i>demonstrates both admirably and otherwise.</p>
<p>Where <i>Pipe Dreams</i> dared to slash, soar, and even rock, <i>Sway </i>sits still. Moody and indrawn, it’s an album that seems to be about nothing in particular; even its song titles, rendered almost entirely in monosyllables like the band’s name, are vague and diffident. “Dry”, “Clear”, “Lines”, “Feel”: These are not generous words, and that sense of abstraction, distance, and distillation is reflected in the music. “Dry”, to its credit, is anything but; aqueous and shimmering, it’s the album’s best track, an ode to the vastness of sadness that uses surges of distortion to smear its melodrama into an impressionistic apparition. <i>Sway </i>may tend toward monosyllables, but it’s not monochrome. Bursts of light and vivid afterimages color the plodding thrum of “Clear”,  an immersive song that sounds like trying to swim in a sea of simple syrup. “I will…” sings Bassett under his breath before letting the line melt into the ether. The next word isn’t even discernable, and it’s almost better that way. </p>
<p>On the other hand, “Mumble” is one of <i>Sway</i>’s less compelling passages, a relatively flat and featureless hum; much of the album flows by similarly, despite high points such as the title track and “Lines”, both of which are textbook studies in classic shoegaze craft, complete with foamy, boy-girl harmonies and curlicues of sluggish feedback. But in stripping shoegaze to its essence, something is lost. Above all else, <i>Sway</i> is shoegaze music about what it’s like to like shoegaze music. Even the second-tier shoegaze groups of the early '90s wound up trying to evolve in some way, whether it was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28710-chapterhouse/"">Chapterhouse</a>’s electronic-leaning <i>Blood Music</i> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29144-the-boo-radleys/"">the Boo Radleys</a>’ <i>Pet Sounds</i>-indebted <i>Giant Steps</i>.</p>
<p>Whirr haven’t shown a hint of that kind of adventurousness yet, nor is there proof that they even want to. Granted, there’s something to be said for a shoegaze band that’s stuck in the sort of pensive, hypnotic stasis evoked by their music; but with so many bands right now—including Deafheaven—striving to recontextualize shoegaze for a far different time and place, being trapped in the amber of the past, as beautiful as that can be, has its limitations. In its winning attempt to paralyze you,<i> Sway </i>may have paralyzed itself.</p></div>"|19658.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19658-whirr-sway/|6.9|Jason Heller

The set up was straightforward-rock-band, and you could hear hints and flecks of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/395-blonde-redhead/"">Blonde Redhead</a> in what they were doing. Now, they call themselves Salt Cathedral, an evocative and Biblical-sounding name that seems to make reference to the underground Roman church built in a salt mine in  the town of Zipaquirá, a small enclave about 80 miles from Bogotá. (""<a href=""https://plus.google.com/115905891862745036724/about?gl=us&amp;hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Don’t lick the walls</a>,"" one Google Plus user advises.) Ronderos and Losada are from Colombia originally, having settled in Brooklyn, and their music has a strange, evocative bite even as it mines a lot of familiar-sounding sources.</p>
<p>They work exclusively in synths, samples, and keyboard patches, and they make a bookish, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/425-the-books/"">the Books</a>-ish version of electro-pop, one where Ronderos' airy croon melts into the upper register of the song, joined by a bunch of bells, chimes, pealing guitars, and other aviary noises. The salt cathedral that inspired them might be dank and subterranean, but their debut EP, <i>Oom Velt,</i> is all wide-open sky and breezes.</p>
<p>Songs like ""Holy Soul"" and ""Tease"" are essentially strobing pop songs, as immediate and cool to the touch as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28682-ellie-goulding/"">Ellie Goulding</a>'s ""Lights"", but with a few precise angles knocked out of joint. ""Holy Soul"" loops Ronderos' own voice repeating the affecting line ""We won't let our hearts forget this time,"" turning it onto gum strung across the clicking song's gears. The way the sample is clipped, however, sounds uncannily like ""Always forget this time,"" turning the song into a dialogue with itself. She sings other iterations of the sentiment as synth patches and guitars turn to vapor behind her—""forget this time,"" ""get this time,"" ""fade away this time,"" as the song morphs slowly into a meditation on the impossibility of holding onto memories.</p>
<p>Small, pocket-change moments like this give Salt Cathedral's smooth music its few edges and wrinkles. Ronderos is in charge of the sampler, while Losada supplies the tight, supple guitar accompaniment: Live, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZTZQ4ugwus"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">they have a crackling energy that turns into air-conditioning,</a> slightly, on record. There are moments where the mix is so agreeably anonymous it threatens to become music for empty hotel bars, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2832-morcheeba/"">Morcheeba</a> playing to a single well-dressed bartender. ""Tease"", with its ""Can't Get You Out of My Head""-referring club pulse and ""la-la-la"" hook, is both the catchiest song on the EP and also the most likely to escape your notice while it's playing.</p>
<p>The best moments on <i>Oom Velt</i> are the ones where they tread the line between nagging and soothing. The title track, the only instrumental, shifts around small elements in headphone space—synths, samples, and clipped coos all swirl together, and the sensation is a bit like sifting through a bag of change. The small pieces accrete weight when you gather them up: ""Good Winds"" starts out with a koan similar to ""Holy Soul""–""Now I'm lost, can't go on."" Behind her, a comping jazz guitar twinkles. The threat of trip-hop Muzak approaches, but then they beat it back–Ronderos' voice hiccups and glitches in a few surprising spots, and the song's bedsheets wrinkle, just enough. </p></div>"|19783.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19783-salt-cathedral-oom-velt-ep/|6.9|Jayson Greene

Gone are the eight-minute-plus opening tracks, gone are the leaden riffs that dragged <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10314-excellent-italian-greyhound/""><i>Excellent Italian Greyhound</i></a> to its knees. Instead, this record is nine songs of mercilessly lean rock spat out in a half hour and change. This isn’t the sound of a group in its comfort zone, despite appearances to the contrary: Shellac’s status as <a href=""https://www.atpfestival.com/artist/shellac.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ATP</a> house band may have been fun as hell as a gig—especially when given carte blanche to bring along pals like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3192-oxbow/"">Oxbow</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2906-mission-of-burma/"">Mission of Burma</a> whenever they liked—but the gig eventually grew staid, similar to acts that endlessly trawl the reunion circuit, especially considering that new Shellac songs don’t exactly appear very often. Still, appearances can be deceptive, and those ATP shows were often as bone-crunchingly brilliant, disruptive, and hilarious as any of their other appearances.</p>
<p>Despite all that—this is Shellac’s first album in seven years, following another seven-year gap between their prior two records—<i>Dude Incredible</i> sounds surprisingly vital. The songs came together in a piecemeal style, from sessions at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6367-steve-albini/"">Steve Albini</a>’s Electrical Audio studios over the past few years. There’s an overall focus to the record that belies its haphazard construction, with the second half of the record even bearing a dash of conceptual thinking in its suite of “surveyor”-themed songs (a notion Albini has already batted away as <a href=""http://exclaim.ca/News/steve_albini_breaks_down_shellacs_dude_incredible_track_by_track"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“circumstantial”</a>). <i>Dude Incredible</i> further demonstrates how remarkably patient this band can be; the riffing that drives the Bob Weston-fronted “Compliant” is controlled and targeted on precision, with all three band members locked around a feeling of anticipation that only gets loosened in a burst of seconds-long anger at its close. It’s such an unusual structure—all build, and a payoff so brief it barely exists—that it’s hard to know whether to feel shortchanged or to marvel at their restraint.</p>
<p>Sending out confusing signals is all part of the Shellac regime and always has been, but here it’s faster, funnier, and delivered with far more impact than on <i>Greyhound</i>. The riffing on “Dude Incredible” and “The People’s Microphone” is among their finest guitar work to date; the former is all meatheaded grind morphing into all-out battle charge, with Albini yelling and straining over the top, sounding like he’s lost in a state of total release, while the latter is all twisted, knotty confusion, full of bursts of sublime repetition and turns you never anticipate coming around the bend. The overriding feeling is of all three members locking together so tightly because of a compulsion to be in this spot, offloading a whole load of pain and anger onto the world. It’s a very male energy, of course—the idea of Albini being in touch with his feminine side is amusing, to say the least—but at least he can joke about it, as there’s a reason his song about sexual intercourse, “You Came In Me”, is all over in a little over two minutes.</p>
<p>Something that’s radically shifted on this record is in its weightiest piece, which previously found form in extended works such as the opening cuts of <i>Terraform</i> and <i>Greyhound</i>. Here, it’s spread out over several tracks beginning with “All the Surveyors”, a song about the occupation of many of the Founding Fathers, that lands somewhere between absurdity (medieval chants, Albini cawing like a bird) and heads-down heft that pins you to the mat and never lets go. The bird noises even feel like a callback to one of their heaviest (and best) moments, the thunderous “Wingwalker”. Another echo of the past comes in “Gary”, with Albini again focussing on life in a small American city (Gary, Indiana, in this case) just as he did in a more brutal way on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6076-big-black/"">Big Black</a>’s “Jordan, Minnesota”. It’s the quietest moment on the album, but the level of tension remains the same, especially as Albini positively seethes through its central lyric.</p>
<p>What’s most impressive here, and what ties Shellac to their former peers who are either long gone at this point or grinding through the reunion treadmill, is the level of commitment involved. Albini’s a sweaty mess, Weston’s bass only gains more meat to it over the years, and Todd Trainer remains a drummer whose every hit sounds like it hurts a hundred times more than the last. It’s like they took a look at what they were doing and pulled everything apart, rediscovering the level of discomfort that drives them, and working out why they really need to be doing this in the process. Prior records often contained a track or two that were lost somewhere between inspiration, endurance tests, and technical feats (“Didn't We Deserve a Look at You the Way You Really Are” from <i>Terraform</i> ticks all those boxes), but there’s none of that here. Instead, Shellac go straight for your throat and don't loosen their grip until the bitter end. </p></div>"|19842.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19842-shellac-dude-incredible/|8.0|Nick Neyland

It all started three years ago, when Ryan George—a veteran punk who cut his teeth playing with straight-edge band Carry On—met heavy metal roadie Sara Taylor at a mutual friend’s gig at a club in their native Los Angeles. As the two’s relationship blossomed, they discovered a mutual adoration of aggressive music: hardcore punk, speed metal, and curiously, minimal electronica. Early on, the duo's dates consisted of long strolls-turned-jam sessions conducted in the LA backstreets, searching for any scrap of metal capable of producing a beat, eager to milk music from even the rustiest old machines. Their low-fi, high-volume vision rapidly expanded, though, resulting in a crushing 2012 demo and last year's glossier (but nonetheless crushing) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18592-youth-code-youth-code/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a>. These days, Youth Code's idea of a date night resembles a political rally for the <a href=""http://waxtraxchicago.bigcartel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wax Trax</a>! crowd: against a backdrop of riot footage and snarling dogs, Taylor thrashes around onstage, pounding her chest with her fist and unleashing glitch-ridden screams as George plugs away at the ancient keyboards in the corner. They’re two gears operating separately, and yet they share the same cog.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A taster before their new LP arrives, their latest set of tunes, the <i>A Place to Stand </i>EP, is comprised of four original tracks and remixes of four earlier cuts by the likes of Sanford Parker, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32323-clipping/"">clipping.</a>, God Module, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30695-silent-servant/"">Silent Servant</a>. The new EP boils down the grittiness of their early material and the more polished EBM of last year's<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18592-youth-code-youth-code/"">Youth Code </a></i>to their common denominators: namely, punk, tempered with an understated pop sensibility. Associations with the former genre have been reiterated by the band numerous times in interviews, both with regards to their musical upbringing (“We’re these shitty punk kids making industrial,” Ryan shrugged in response to the band’s vociferous reception) and their steadfast devotion to D.I.Y. craftsmanship. But despite Taylor’s recent declaration that her band was “not going to write a fucking pop record”, there’s no questioning the influence of styles well-removed from the hostile terrain Youth Code calls home. </p>
<p class=""p1"">As a result, these songs strike a curious paradox: they're aggressive, noise-ridden, angst-ridden and forlorn, but the soundscapes shouldn’t put off anyone who’s heard a lick of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32310-godflesh/"">Godflesh</a> or tour mates Skinny Puppy. Sure, Taylor's snarls on opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17031-youth-code-consuming-guilt/"" target=""_blank"">“Consuming Guilt”</a> sound like her vocal cords were rubbed with steel wool, and the clattering factory noise on the chorus will definitely prove aural candy for the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2780-ministry/"">Ministry</a> set; but within the context of the song’s steady four-count, verse-chorus-verse blueprint, the song's melodic flourishes (the mournful keyboards on the chorus, the dark-wavey driving hook) belie a popper construction that solders surprisingly well to Youth Code’s punk worldview. Mechanical ambience and surly new wave make for compelling bedfellows on “For I Am Cursed”, with Taylor’s vocal glitches punctuating George’s piston-pumping beats at odd intervals. “To Burn Your World”, meanwhile, could have been a cut on the soundtrack to some hellish arcade game: the whooshing crescendoes that echo her vocals sound like some sinister power-up.</p>
<p class=""p2""><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Given Youth Code’s roots (along with their penchant using for propaganda footage in their stage shows), it’s unsurprising that their personal politics stretch beyond a musical context. These concerns are laid out in detail on the last new track on the EP, an airing of grievances fittingly titled “A Litany (A Place to Stand)”. As the drum kit totters wildly in the background, a steady stream of sixteenth-notes alternated with quick bass jabs, Taylor warns of all toxic baggage that will be entrusted to the next generation: racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and above all, hatred. Her diction is blunt and arresting—""The time has come where we stop mandating what rights others do with their free bodies, where we stop looking upon other as if they were just bags of discarded, unworthy flesh”—but as the beat rages on in the background, with nary a dynamic shift or noise blast in sight, the track begins to sound like a soapbox postscript without a working compass. This transience overshadows </span><i>A Place to Stand </i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">as well, making it less a unified statement and more along of a sounding board for the musical and political concerns with which the band continues to grapple. Youth Code have handled things pretty well by themselves up to this point—and as any self-taught engineers know, sometimes the instruments of destruction just need a closer inspection.</span></p></div>"|19826.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19826-youth-code-a-place-to-stand-ep/|6.8|Zoe Camp

Even before<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16989-myrkur-nattens-barn/"" target=""_blank""> the release of “Nattens Barn,” </a>a six-minute slide between celestial vocals, blast beats, and a coda that combines the two, onlookers began speculating about the identity of Relapse’s new signee. She was named after the Icelandic word for <a href=""http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/myrkur"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“darkness”</a> (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyOsJwLu9GQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">and possibly an early Sigur Rós song?</a>) and had roots in Denmark, but little else seemed certain. She was a model from Los Angeles, some insisted, a mere marketing ploy from one of metal’s major labels to create the heavy world’s <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/artists/29855-lana-del-rey/"">Lana Del Rey</a>; others maintained, though, that Relapse was right—that, as their press releases asserted, she had indeed “emerg[ed] from the darkness of Scandinavia” and did possess “a distinct sense of Nordic isolation.” The debate fomented controversy on message boards, music blogs, and their itinerant comment threads. People lodged researched guesses as to Myrkur’s identity, extoled her as black metal’s possible popular savior, and said inordinately hateful things about her label, her gender, and her heritage—all, of course, without hearing very much of her fastidiously rudimentary seven-song, self-titled debut EP.</p>
<p>As many have suggested, Myrkur is indeed Amalie Bruun, a <a href=""http://www.thatfashiondude.com/7-questions-singer-amalie-bruun/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">successful Danish model</a> who has lived and worked in America for many years and co-leads Brooklyn <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/2428820-Ex-Cops"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">buzz-pop band Ex-Cops</a>. She’s made <a href=""http://amaliebruun.bandcamp.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pleasant solo singles and albums</a> and worked for <a href=""http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/style/articles/2010-08/23/gq-style-news-martin-scorsese-film-for-chanel-de-bleu"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chanel and Scorsese</a>, appeared in that Lonely Island music video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI6CfKcMhjY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">alongside Michael Bolton</a> and <a href=""http://www.elle.com/life-love/personal-style/amalie-bruun-profile"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">led <i>Elle</i></a> on a shopping tour of Brooklyn—all things omitted from the project's initial reveal. After months of conjecture, Myrkur’s publicist finally confirmed the bandleader’s identity a week before the release of the EP, information that went public only the day the record was issued.</p>
<p>“I don’t think any record label prefers an artist who doesn’t want to do any press,” Bruun said in <a href=""http://blog.bandcamp.com/2014/09/16/shedding-light-on-the-darkness-of-myrkur/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the interview that revealed her identity</a>. “But it was my requirement or I didn’t wish to release the EP at all.” Maybe that’s right, but doesn’t it seem suspect that months of careful, chatter-inducing concealment ended on the targeted date—a break in the dam of discussion, meant to lift the once-mysterious project into circulation again? This perfect scenario feels more like good marketing than pedestrian coincidence.</p>
<p>But the dust-up and release plan, turns out, are much ado about very little, at least for now. <i>Myrkur</i> isn’t a masterful release full of grand visions and endless intrigue; rather, it’s an occasionally charged listen that is, at best, more confident in its promise than its purpose. Bruun’s underlying approach is a rather simple one—bait and lace primitive black metal with pretty textures featuring a multi-tracked choir of one. Opener “Ravnens Banner” unfurls dreamy harmonies, stretched by echo that suggests the granite walls of a great cathedral. After a minute, her flat-toned electric guitar—a manipulated sheet of sheer static—hangs atop racing drums, credited to Swedish friend Rex Myrnur. The pace staggers, speeds and, at one point, stops altogether, returning for a mid-tempo climax where Bruun’s own lofty tone hangs like drapes over the livid arrangement.</p>
<p>There’s variation, of course, like the placid acoustic-and-electric waltz of “Frosne” and the brief, vocals-only postlude “Ulvesangen.” During the tempestuous “Må Du Brænde i Helvede,” Bruun even screams, bellows, and grunts, imploring a sort of dark sorcery that she most often leaves to the instruments. But by and large, Bruun looks for compulsion in contrast and, ultimately, the consolidation of these disparate elements. That’s epitomized by “Latvian Fegurð”, which flips between an angelic introduction, a bruising body, and a noisy onslaught—moves that comingle in the song’s final minute. She even adds a bit of alt-rock melancholy (or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOy3jaBqIMU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Mellon Collie</i>, as it were</a>) during “Dybt i Skoven.”</p>
<p>This combination of madness and majesty in black metal is nothing new; Bruun cites <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4414-ulver/"">Ulver</a> as a touchstone, and that’s something they’ve always done well. Bruun dutifully touts and embraces the form’s longstanding roots in and fascination with classical composers, too. More recently, pillow-topped acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4783-wolves-in-the-throne-room/"">Wolves in the Throne Room</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30011-deafheaven"">Deafheaven</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5913-alcest/"">Alcest</a> have attained relative popularity by overwhelming the listener on simultaneous fronts. The real frustration with <i>Myrkur</i>, then, is not the whiff of marketing chicanery or publicity deception; it’s that these songs offer skeletal suggestions of what’s come before them, with the barest of bones doing nothing to support the spirit and vigor that gives the best of this ilk its strength. You get the sense that, lifelong metal <i>fan </i>or not, Bruun is simply trying on these ideas as a musician. She’s yet to commit to living in them. The only thing overwhelming about Bruun’s black metal is the prevailing sense of being underwhelmed.</p>
<p>Remember, though, this is a debut EP in a crowded, active, contentious field, and there are moments here that peak beyond only promise. Yes, Bruun is a professional musician and model, and her premature hype has been powered by a large PR campaign and record label. And no, these seven songs don’t warrant the hubbub they’ve created. But moments of <i>Myrkur </i>move beyond narrative intrigue, hinting at more than this start can deliver. Let’s hope Bruun’s sudden exposure, intentional or not, won’t prevent her from pursuing them.</p></div>"|19808.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19808-myrkur-myrkur/|5.9|Grayson Haver Currin

But as a man once said, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_MVFJh1I8Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the underground just spun around and did a 360</a>. Hildebrand’s first Foxes In Fiction full-length, the 2010 release <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14385-swung-from-the-branches/""><i>Swung From the Branches</i></a>, was a charming bedroom databank of feverishly devout <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5633-atlas-sound"">Atlas Sound</a> worship with an even more endearing presentation; reeling from the death of his teenage brother, Hildebrand posted a story behind every one of its 22 tracks on his MySpace page. <span>Four years later, Hildebrand's Bushwick-based ""bedroom pop"" cassette label </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19254-boring-ecstasy-the-bedroom-pop-of-orchid-tapes"" target=""_blank"">Orchid Tapes</a><span>, named after a </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5094-deerhunter"" target=""_blank"">Deerhunter</a><span> </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KI3KwoXYwA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">song</a><span>, has likewise been lauded by the internet-savvy for its presentation—a loose stylistic affiliation of extroverts making introverted art.</span></p>
<p><i>Ontario Gothic</i> ditches the tape loops, drones and noise collages that padded out <i>Swung from the Branches</i>, its weight distributed amongst seven fleshy tracks. It’s a concise statement of purpose that showcases a single kind of Foxes in Fiction song: downtempo and arctic in ambience, compositionally minimal, and “pop” in the sense that they contain repeating melodic lines. Though they're not based on samples and loops as overtly as his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7862-bradford-cox/"">Bradford Cox</a> mash-notes of the past, they might as well be.</p>
<p>While some of Hildebrand’s fellow Orchid Tapes artists have become persons of interest, <i>Ontario Gothic</i> taps a relative superstar in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6803-owen-pallett"">Owen Pallett</a>, who lends string arrangements. According to the credits, Pallett laid tracks in London years after Hildebrand completed them in his apartment, and they’re sweeping, sumptuous and weirdly conservative compared to his own work, but they give Hildebrand’s otherwise modest and muted music all the luxury it can bear; whenever those horsehairs well up, it’s like noticing an extremely expensive belt on a guy in a T-shirt and jeans.</p>
<p>But in shifting the focus from Hildebrand as scattered and prodigious to someone meant to be evaluated on execution, <i>Ontario Gothic</i> exposes a guy who has a lot of interesting ideas about music, but few interesting musical ideas.  In retrospect, the “pop” songs on <i>Swung from the Branches</i> (“15 Ativan (Song for Erika)”, “Memory Pools”) were notable for their ingenuity, immersive atmosphere, and context; within a primarily ambient record, they stood out by default. At its best, <i>Ontario Gothic</i> is dream-pop projected as a warm, friendly embrace rather than as an enveloping mystery. Chords progress predictably and are grouped in predictable patterns, Hildebrand’s placid melodies do maintain an underlying humane warmth, reverb is a given, rather than a textural tool, and his dynamics are limited to a mesmeric repetition or a building by incremental overlap.</p>
<p>If “March 2011” was dunked in guitar distortion, it could pass for the droning doom-gaze from the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30251-whirr"">Whirr</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31634-nothing"">Nothing</a>, while the relatively uptempo “Glow (v079)” could slide undetected into a more recent Kompakt <i>Pop Ambient</i> mix. But otherwise, <i>Ontario Gothic</i> is truly ambient pop<span>—</span>for all of its homemade and “personal” presentation, there’s little that distinguishes it as the work of Warren Hildebrand. His lyrics are often emotional tracework, indicative of someone in touch with his feelings but often lacking poetic expression: too vague to really hit a nerve, lacking the mystery to inspire further discovery. His imagery is borne of light, shade, water, and the like<span>—</span>“My shadow was drowned in a sea underground” is the standard lyrical fare here. It’s not until “Altars”, a group chorale/requiem with the very idiosyncratic no-fi folk act <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31228-julia-brown/"">Julia Brown</a>, that <i>Ontario Gothi</i>c actually comes to life, as Orchid Tapes’ communal uplift is presented in real time, recalling a washed out version of the all-hands-on-deck songs that would pop up on Saddle Creek records back when they were young, wildly prolific, and still hanging out together.</p>
<p>That speaks to the appeal of Orchid Tapes in the first place, a collective that stands to snag the interest of anyone invested in the concepts of “punk”, “indie”, “scene”, and “DIY”. So the charm of <i>Ontario Gothic</i> is derived from one of the most thrilling and rewarding feelings one can have as an artist, or simply a consumer of art—that great music can be created amongst your friends, and how the resulting feeling can come across as more inherently special than anything consumed on a mass scale. <i>Ontario Gothic</i> is certainly part of a great story; but as a perfectly satisfying half hour of modest and common dream-pop, it's not much of a story on its own.</p></div>"|19683.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19683-foxes-in-fiction-ontario-gothic/|6.3|Ian Cohen

His 2012 LP <i><a href=""http://editionsmego.com/release/SP-017"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fighting!</a></i> was an unpredictable gem, and his next effort promised more surpise, as he travelled to Colorado to record with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1871-neil-michael-hagerty/"">Neil Michael Hagerty</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4619-wolf-eyes/"">Wolf Eyes’</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30040-nate-young/"">Nate Young</a>. But even he probably didn’t expect those sessions to produce a second record by a spontaneous new band called Dan’l Boone, consisting of himself, Hagerty, Young, and Charles Ballas, a member of Hagerty’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2031-the-howling-hex/"">Howling Hex</a> band.</p>
<p>Bringing such large-sized musical personalities together could be a recipe for chaos, and judging by Moskos’ hilariously confusing press notes, the process wasn’t exactly orderly; he claims, “we never knew if we working on the Drainolith record or the Boone record”. But while Dan’l Boone happily courts disarray, these four outward-bound heads manage to keep everything legible. Even at its densest, this is well-lit music, with all the brushstrokes visible and travels mappable. At times it sounds like the musicians are passing through the room separately rather than sitting in it together, but that’s often a plus: the way sounds ping-pong around each track creates a loose tension, tempting you to stick around for what might happen next.</p>
<p><i>Dan’l Boone</i> opens with a sample from Wolf Eyes’ last album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17968-wolf-eyes-no-answer-lower-floors/"">No Answer: Lower Floors</a></i>, which could be seen as a statement—but no single voice ever really takes precedence here. Hagerty’s peculiar way around a repetitive phrase gets some sway, and the vocals hit an intense moan common to both Young and Moskos. The sparse, sinister rumble of “Mindface” could pass for Drainolith (or Young’s minimalist solo project <a href=""http://www.wolfeyes.net/nateyoung/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Regression</a>), and the mashed-up howls of “Hostage Rock” briefly catch Wolf Eyes-like fire. But most of the time, Dan’l Boone intertwines sounds without blurring them – the work of a collective rather than hierarchical group. Such creative democracy rewards repeat listens, as focusing on each element reveals new patterns.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Dan’l Boone also provides the simple thrill of the bracingly weird, an effect enhanced by the participants’ track records in demented abstraction. It’s especially tempting—and not too tough —to hear echoes of Hagerty’s ground-tearing work in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3610-royal-trux/"">Royal Trux</a> circa <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Infinitives"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twin Infintitves</a></i>, especially in the fuzzy casio-loops of “Thee Testimonye of An Maiden”. But every member injects some insanity to the proceedings, slipping it under the surface like tectonic plates shifting beneath seemingly-solid ground. Part of the craziness is, paradoxically, methodical: Moskos claims that, at one point, he sang a 12-bar blues which Ballas and Young chopped into 300 pieces and randomly rearragned. Nothing here sounds as wacky as that suggests, but undercurrents of randomness course throughout.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Still, after listening to </span><i>Dan’l Boone</i>, it's understandable to be left with<span> an odd sense of calm. The band’s brand of chaos leans toward the hypnotic rather than the assaultive; all the rambling activity can free the mind from pattern-seeking, letting it ride the noisy currents like a paddle-less raft. <span>It seems like something similar happened to this quartet when they were making the album; perhaps the new surroundings and lack of expectations gave their instincts priority.</span> Of course, Moskos’ recounting could just be myth-making, and perhaps everything here was carefully planned and executed, but what matters is </span><i>Dan’l Boone </i><span><i>sounds</i> spontaneous, and all the more alive because of it.</span></p></div>"|19696.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19696-danl-boone-danl-boone/|7.6|Marc Masters

His long-running project Purling Hiss—which started as a solo affair before being fleshed out into a full band—hasn’t ever particularly <i>sounded</i> like Young’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5033-neil-young-crazy-horse/"">Crazy Horse</a>, but there’s a similar dynamic at play: one moment Polizze is pouring mud all over his lonesome folk ballads, and the next he’s punching the haywire distortion into noise-jam extremes. Purling Hiss’ most recent full-length, last year’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17713-purling-hiss-water-on-mars/"">Water on Mars</a></i>, was produced by fellow Philadelphian Adam Granduciel of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs/"">the War on Drugs</a>, and it showed a little more discipline and neatness without sacrificing any of Polizze’s prodigious, religious fretwork.</p>
<p>Purling Hiss’ new album, <i>Weirdon</i>, goes even further in that direction, but not by much. It’s tighter and clearer-sounding, but what really makes it stand out is its reconciliation of everything Polizze has dabbled in over the past half-decade. More precisely, Purling Hiss have settled into a sharply defined middle ground: gentle strumming and blown-out heaviness still lurk in the wings, but the sweet spot is punk rock'n'roll. Granted, that still leaves Polizze plenty of room to maneuver, and he does so with lithe agility. “Sundance Saloon Boogie” lays a silly, three-note, clean-toned guitar hook over a jumble of junky riffs; Polizze’s vocals are half chanted, half commanded, and his slop-bucket solo is torn straight from Bob Stinson’s beer-stained playbook. Things are looser on <i>Weirdon</i>’s other punk rippers, including “Learning Slowly” and “Where’s Sweetboy”; the latter is particularly inspired, sapping its energy straight from <i>Raw Power</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"">Stooges</a> filtered through the Saints’ first album.</p>
<p>Still, this is a contained, controlled album. The leash is stretched to the breaking point on otherwise tranquil “Forcefield of Solitude”, which bears a faint trace of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"">Dinosaur Jr.</a> in Polizze’s narcoleptic drawl. His lyrics don’t amount to much—a spare image here, a catchy incantation there—but they're all served up with unforced melodic ease. It’s a charming approach that works best on “Airwaves”, the album’s hands-down pop gem; with chicken-wire jangle and hokey walking bass propelling him, Polizze kicks on the singsong in a chorus that extolls the virtues of its own ridiculous catchiness. “This is my radio!”, he repeats like a mantra, cramming in an anthem’s worth of joyousness in under a minute and a half. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29754-the-men/"">the Men</a>’s recent output, “Airwaves” calls to mind the ramshackle, 1980s heyday of SST Records, but its genial twang is more <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17834-firehose/"">fIREHOSE</a> than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6048-minutemen/"">Minutemen</a>.<b> </b></p>
<p><i>Weirdon</i> doesn’t dwell long on folkier sounds, but when it does, it makes the most of it. ""Reptili-A-Genda"" oozes ghosts and dissonance, but its psychedelic edges don’t obscure the bluesy haze at its core. For all its upbeat, euphoric outpouring of guitar, bass, and drums, the album retains the solitary, cranky strangeness that made early releases like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19184-purling-hiss-dizzy-polizzy-purling-hiss/"">Purling Hiss</a> </i>and<i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19184-purling-hiss-dizzy-polizzy-purling-hiss/""> Dizzy Polizzy</a> </i>so entrancing. That atmosphere congeals beautifully on “Six Ways to Sunday”, eight minutes of melancholy rumination and overdriven, hideously lovely minor chords, the kind that trawl the pit of your soul if held too long. Polizze doesn’t, though; instead, he submerges and surfaces, a cycle of shadows and sunrise that puts the rest of the album into a similar mood-swinging context. And fittingly enough, the saga-length guitar meltdown—lilting yet monolithic—that meanders throughout “Six Ways to Sunday” sounds eerily like Neil Young at his Crazy Horsiest. <i>Weirdon</i> doesn’t attempt to alter the course or conviction of Polizze’s faith in six strings, a volume knob, and the truth, but it does make it more compelling than ever.</p></div>"|19657.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19657-purling-hiss-weirdon/|7.5|Jason Heller

Longtime San Marcos quartet This Will Destroy You have always been their own act, though: they're weirder, darker, and noisier, and on their fourth album, <i>Another Language</i>, they move further away from post-rock into something that's cut-up and quietly experimental but that maintains a strong emotional pull. This Will Destroy You don't rely on huge climaxes in each piece, and <i>Another Language</i> is patient, with many drifts and phases that make the bigger moments seem even more massive.</p>
<p>The record follows the 2013 live document <i>Live in Reykjavik, Iceland</i>, and it features uplifting, crushingly melancholic instrumentals, which is expected from this band. But the dynamics are more interior than in the past, and This Will Destroy You aren't afraid to explore near-silence for extended moments, as waves work themselves out slowly. Songs end before they seem like they should, which creates an interesting, disorienting effect, and each track feels like it's part of the one before and after it. Pieces shift in the middle of themselves, to the point that sometimes the movements between songs feel more connected than a split in the middle of one; without the tracklist at hand, it's difficult to know what's starting and what's ending.</p>
<p>The quartet's been around since 2004, and in that time, they've gotten better at developing, and deconstructing their own specific approach. On 2011's gorgeous <i>Tunnel Blanket</i>, which was mixed and recorded by John Congleton (who also produced the new album), they perfected their self-described ""doomgaze"" across eight tracks that sounded like backwoods loner-rock lullabies and rabid anthems that often focused on mortality and death. Though the subject matter is less explicit, you get that feeling here, too. The band's label says <i>Another Language</i> was recorded after a ""prolonged vacuous dark period that threatened to break both the band and the members themselves."" That's fairly vague, but the songs aren't: This Will Destroy You have a way of making feedback talk.</p>
<p>A good comparison point is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4785-russian-circles/"">Russian Circles</a>, specifically the excellent 2013 album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18675-russian-circles-memorial/""><i>Memorial</i></a>, another instrumental exploration of end times. But whereas <i>Memorial</i> took on a metallic sound, the atmosphere that This Will Destroy You create is like doom classical. The tone throughout, which they maintain elegantly across tracks, matches the color of the cover art: each song seems like an echo, with moments from the earlier songs repeated and fleshed out, or revisited as a whisper. Sometimes the band come across as a burlier <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros"">Sigur Rós</a>, and when they get heavy, it makes the room vibrate.</p>
<p>Despite the sonic overlaps, <i>Another Language</i> remains sneakily varied and difficult to pin down. There's rattling, dubbed-out drums, unhinged strings, levigating shoegaze guitars, electronic drifts and blowouts, synthesizers that seem almost sentient, and layers of gentle, toy-box notes over woozy, kitchen-sink noise. The jazz of ""Mother Opiate"" evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/606-bohren-der-club-of-gore/"">Bohren &amp; der Club of Gore</a>, and on opener ""New Topia"", deep synthesizer washes and plaintive guitars build up for a minute and a half, before slow-motion drums march in front of friskier noises towards a huge, blissful, earplug-rattling wash. ""Serpent Mound"" offers twisting, churning electronics and aching guitars worthy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a> and the ghosts that band's known to pack into their sprawl; ""The Puritan"" is an ambient refrain that feels like wind drifting across a burnt-out prairie, and the explosive martial pace and windy space ringing inside ""War Prayer"" send chills. Some songs make me think of laying on my back in a planetarium, wondering about friends who've died.</p>
<p>The band makes unexpected dynamic pushes seem easy to pull off and easier to internalize as a listener, but on first listen, each comes as a surprise. This Will Destroy You don't write obvious songs and are at their best when they're being loud, with guitars soaring, the drums frantic but maintaining a precise, plaintive mood amid the chaos. Sometimes, as a new song begins, the band gives off the feeling of someone picking themselves up, smacking the dust off their pants, and starting over again.</p>
<p>When taking into consideration the record's longer stretches and curious excursions, <i>Another Language</i> gives the impression that the band is, in fact, working out its own communication system, following a logic outside of the song constructions themselves. The record ends with ""God's Teeth"", and it reinscribes earlier guitar swirls that churn into a hiss of decaying electronic noise before fading to black. There's a lot in those final moments, especially considering all the push and pull that comes before it. It conjures the way a room looks in the dark, the edges of everything blurred as someone puts their head down, finally able to sleep.</p></div>"|19619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19619-this-will-destroy-you-another-language/|7.2|Brandon Stosuy

He ends the record with a toast to his old pal ""Barry Richardson"", whose pub-as-temple theologizing makes the increasingly temperate Kelly just a little jealous. At more than one point on <i>The </i><i>Long Con</i>, Kelly starts rattling off all the jobs held by his friends and neighbors; these moments play like the tail end of one of those long, winding Sunday afternoon calls home, when you've run through all your personal business and—desperate for material—start catching your mom up on what your friends are up to. Whether he's whiling away an afternoon at the bar with an old <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12358-madness/"">Madness</a> record in the background or idly wondering about the inner life of reclusive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12927-queen/"">Queen</a> bassist John Deacon, Kelly seems to be feeling his age throughout <i>The </i><i>Long Con</i>: he may look the part of a guy in his late twenties, but he can't always seem to see himself in the role. For Kelly, <i>The</i> <i>Long Con</i> is adulthood—with all its attendant mundanity and fatigue—and he's just another mark.<br/><br/>Produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1048-deerhoof/"">Deerhoof</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7586-greg-saunier/"">Greg Saunier</a>, <i>The Long Con</i> marks both So Cow's first time in the studio and their first LP as a trio, with Kelly's (mostly) one-man show now rounded out with bassist Jonny White and drummer Peter O'Shea. Rarely is the leap from bent-over-a-Tascam lo-fi to proper studio concern made gracefully, but Saunier leaves the oft-scrappy So Cow sounding brighter, more nimble; they bounce between chatty <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4753-television-personalities/"">Television Personalities</a>-styled punkers, nimble kiwi-pop-styled soothers, and wistful pub-rockers with ease, with a more than a couple twisted little turnarounds lovingly cribbed from the Deerhoof playbook. From the beginning, Kelly's matched punk energy with austere, to-the-point hookcraft, and on <i>The </i><i>Long Con</i>, he gets to stretch out a bit: for every two-and-a-half-minute bruiser, there's a sweet, wistful ""Sugar Factory"" or a moody self-exam like ""Vigilanti Cura"" showing Kelly's quietly impressive range and breaking up the otherwise frenetic pace.</p>
<p>That said, at 42 minutes, <i>The </i><i>Long Con</i> would've easily stood up to a more judicious editor; take away several slight—if spirited—pop-punkers padding out the album's midsection, and nobody'd be the wiser. There are a few moments when the studio seems to've gotten the best of Kelly, too; the lengthy feedback blasts at the center of ""Second Last Line of the National Anthem"" and the churning stoner-rock send-off to ""I Want Out"" come across as superfluous. Lyrically, Kelly pulls off ""sincere"" and ""sly"" with roughly equal success, but at several points throughout <i>The </i><i>Long Con</i>—particularly the angst-ridden ""Turning Into You""—all the personality gets lost in a sea of stock phrases and atypically blunt emotional outbursts.<br/><br/>Still, it's easy to forgive Kelly his indulgences, however minor; this is, after all, the same guy who's trying to limit his intake of ""chicken and black-pepper sauce."" Throughout <i>The Long Con</i>'s story-songs and stray thoughts, Kelly keeps circling around the same idea—specifically, that maybe there's something he ought to be doing besides pissing away another Sunday at the pub, wondering if there's something else he ought to be doing. Should he pack it in, get a job, join the rank-and-file? Or should he ring up his old pal Barry and meet him for a pint or three?<br/><br/>From his perch in the back bar, the faintly bemused, quietly hilarious, easily distractible Kelly tries to figure how he grew old—as old as you feel in your late twenties, anyway—without quite feeling like he grew up. There's no histrionic ""what do I stand for?""-style soul-searching on<i> The Long Con</i>; rather, there's just Kelly—a smirk on his face, a little lager on his breath, caught between the 21-year-olds taking birthday shots and the 60-something lifers on their fifth Guinesses—trying to make the most of it. <i>The Long Con</i> is a knobby, scatterbrained listen, but it's got more than enough charm to see you around the rough edges.</p></div>"|19804.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19804-so-cow-the-long-con/|6.9|Paul Thompson

If anything, he seems to be hiding behind the moniker, recalling the brief moment, three or four years ago, when indie bands stumbled upon a brief obsession with un-googleable names (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1826-girls/"">Girls</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28984-tennis/"">Tennis</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"">Real Estate</a>)—that, or he just finds the name hilarious.</p>
<p>Pollie grew up in Philadelphia but now lives and records in Los Angeles, and his music has the sort of dreamy air that would entertain these sorts of idle fancies. His self-titled debut is a pleasingly rumpled yawn of California pop, ambitious in arrangement and melody and narrow in scope. Most of the richly arranged and spacious songs focus on the ache of being alone or the satisfaction of it. ""I let her go and that was wrong,"" he sings on ""She Came Through (Again)"", the song title rounding out the story and letting you know that someone important to him is giving him second (or third) chances. ""It's happening again, I can be so selfish/ But you're the only one I can be myself with,"" goes the chorus to ""The Only One"".</p>
<p>Pollie sings these pretty choruses about alone time in a quiet voice resembling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7151-ira-kaplan/"">Ira Kaplan</a>'s, the kind of plainspoken whisper often associated with public radio announcers. He strums casually, sometimes messily, on an acoustic or a lightly distorted electric, lending the songs on <i>LAPD</i> the sort of just-sitting-around energy that conjured the phrase ""bedroom pop"" into existence. You can practically shut your eyes and see the chord snaking messily around the bed sheets while he sings from a notebook.</p>
<p>But beneath its rumpled surface, <i>Los Angeles Police Department</i> isn't casual or tossed-off, as Pollie has layered all sorts of detail into his songs, which give away obsessions with painstaking craft. He's an off-handedly excellent musician who seems to be just messing around, even when he's racking up triple word scores. The drafty-ceiling melancholy and watercolor sound of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"">Grizzly Bear</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9365-yellow-house/""><i>Yellow House</i></a> is all over <i>LAPD</i>, and the way the song structures braid together like the wicker in an Amish rocking chair would probably impress <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6761-ed-droste/"">Ed Droste</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8906-daniel-rossen/"">Daniel Rossen</a>. ""Go Down"" is broken down into globular little sections, one of them a toy-marching-band fugue, that tells us Pollie has done some intense <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8781-smile/""><i>Smile</i></a> studying.  On ""August 31"", where Pollie admits he's ""getting tired of my friends,"" he layers himself into a stacked choir and harmonizes with himself gloriously.</p>
<p><i>LAPD</i> is less than half an hour's worth of music—it slots neatly into a morning walk, and because it's murmured and low-key, it's easy music to make friends with without over-scrutinizing. It's a first-cup-of-coffee album, the cotton-wispy music played when people are still peeling back filters of consciousness and gathering the wherewithal to join the world again. Gloriously arranged with a late-summer-light country rock haze, <i>LAPD</i> is big shady tree we can sit beneath, shielding us from the real world the same way Pollie's curiously anonymous band name does for him.</p></div>"|19747.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19747-los-angeles-police-department-los-angeles-police-department/|7.5|Jayson Greene

Three decades have now elapsed since Jean Smith and David Lester first tore through the political and aesthetic traditions of independently minded guitar-pop, but Johnson's point spoke less to their sheer longevity and more to their sense of urgency with respect to the ideals that they dedicated themselves to at the band's inception in 1984. On <i>Empathy for the Evil</i>, their first LP since 2006, the band works with the same minimalist indie-pop toolbox as ever, but the duo's embraced a newfound sense of melodicism, too, which makes Smith's politicized lyrics easier to swallow. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Despite the influence that Mecca Normal's had on generations of politically conscious indie rock, the sonic muck of those efforts garbled the wide-eyed messages that Smith often tried to convey. On <i>Empathy, </i>however, the tough gnarls of Lester's distorted guitar pricks and Smith's hyperactive vocal workouts are tamed in favor of clarity and transparency. Production help from Kramer (known for his work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500"">Galaxie 500</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1874-half-japanese/"">Half Japanese</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2546-low/"">Low</a>) cleans up the requisite fuzz from the band's K days, presenting these songs as unvarnished and uncomplicated rather than serpentine and nervy. As a consequence, Smith's lyrics pop to the foreground of the record, laying bare its heavy thematic concerns. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">As ever, <i>Empathy</i> finds Smith sing-speaking her way through giant blocks of text. Rather than break something like ""Naked &amp; Ticklish"" into something that might scan as poetry, she offers a short story about the Rottweilers that have interrupted her recent romantic engagements. It's the prosaic sort of lyricism that pops up in the work of literarily minded songwriters like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2331-mark-kozelek/"">Mark Kozelek</a> or <a href=""v"">Craig Finn</a>, but rather than focus her gaze inward, Smith's characters deal with the inequality and power imbalances that mark modern society. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">The closing suite of ""Maisy's Death"" and ""Odele's Bath"" deal with the specific story of a daughter learning to deal with her abusive father in the wake of her mother's death—but Smith doesn't simply paint it as a character study, allowing herself a few analytical interjections. A character comes to realize that ""as a female she was interchangeable"" and another ""can't understand her brother’s urge to comply with the universal code of normal."" These heady moments come, as always, in the guise of guitar pop, however warped and misshapen. It's the same sort of rhetoric that's underpinned their work from the very beginning, but after years of striving, the potent thematic work is finally able to sneak through the anxious instrumentals. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">More than anything, <i>Empathy for the Evil </i>exists to underscore Johnson's point about the duo: given Smith's persistent thematic concerns, the sense is that they're never going to simply pack it in, but they're not content to retread old ground, either. For Mecca Normal that means pushing their fractured and fractious sound into a production aesthetic more akin to the MOR guitar machine that their initial records raged against. They're still saying all the same things—but on <i>Empathy for the Evil</i>,<i> </i>they've just decided that they want to say them a little more clearly.</span></p></div>"|19731.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19731-mecca-normal-empathy-for-the-evil/|6.7|Colin Joyce

In <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4596-wilco/"">Wilco</a> 1.0, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/329-jay-bennett/"">Jay Bennett</a> helped shape the sunburnt pop of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8677-summer-teeth/"">Summerteeth</a></i> and the twitchy roots-noise grandeur of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8676-yankee-hotel-foxtrot/"">Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</a></i>; in Wilco 2.0. it was guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/778-nels-cline/"">Nels Cline</a> and drummer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4779-glenn-kotche/"">Glenn Kotche</a> stretching Tweedy’s songs into <i>k</i><i>osmische</i> jams. This is not to downplay Tweedy’s contributions to the band he fronts—just the opposite, in fact, as he uses these idiosyncratic musicians to color in the corners of his own vision.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=spencer+tweedy"">Spencer Tweedy</a> doesn’t have the pedigree of those musicians—at least, not yet. He may have played on albums by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13971-mavis-staples/"">Mavis Staples</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5577-white-denim/"">White Denim</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18348-sarah-lee-guthrie-johnny-irion-wassiac-way/"">Sarah Lee Guthrie &amp; Johnny Irion</a>, but as of this writing he can’t drink legally. Any allegations of nepotism, regardless, are handily dispelled on <i>Sukierae</i>, the double album that Spencer and his dad have recorded under their shared surname. On these 20 songs, the younger Tweedy emerges as the kind of musician who actively challenges his old man. His playing is rooted in jazz, rock, and avant-garde, which means he doesn’t simply keep time and add a lot of fills—but he still defines the grain and texture of these songs. Spencer gives “Diamond Light, Pt. 1” its jittery gallop, “Low Key” its low-key hustle, “World Away” its classic rock rumble. Favoring what might be described as a strum—rolling across toms and kick drum in a rhythm that rocks toward and away from the beat—Spencer ensures his father’s pop melodies never sound settled or merely decorous. Instead, he conveys a jumpy paranoia, as though he and his dad expect to hear the worst news possible.</p>
<p>Listen for his brief pause in the beat on “Slow Love”, which Spencer punctuates with a cymbal crash. It’s a sly trick, which at first seems to disrupt Jeff’s dad-folk tune—as teenagers typically do—but ultimately that small glitch in the song’s momentum commiserates with his dad’s understated rumination on love and commitment, creating a fleeting moment when you can identify the security of a long-term relationship or question it. “What to call it but falling in love,” Jeff sings, striking that familiar tone of laid-back melancholy. “I never needed to know what is was.” The lyrics are straightforward, but the music injects some ambiguity into the song even as it underscores the father-son dynamic. The song works better when you know it’s all in the family.</p>
<p>There are other musicians on <i>Sukierae</i>, including Scott McCaughey on keyboards and vocalists Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig on backing vocals. But <i>Sukierae</i> is typically at its best when it emphasizes Jeff as the proud singer-guitarist and Spencer as the drummer—in other words, when the music is stripped down to its barest essentials, when it’s at its most minimalist, when even the saddest tunes sound like they were a joy to create. And there are many sad tunes on <i>Sukierae</i>, or at least many conflicted tunes pitched somewhere between celebratory and commiserative. Most of them address, usually in a roundabout way, Susan Tweedy’s <a href=""http://pages.lightthenight.org/il/ChicagoL14/TeamSusanMillerTweedy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">battle</a> with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a malignant but treatable form of cancer. The album takes her family nickname as its title, and the backstory lends the music a different urgency, one that belies the breeziness of songs like “<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55807-wilcos-jeff-tweedy-and-son-spencer-share-video-for-summer-noon-as-tweedy/"">Summer Noon</a>” and “Wait for Love”. Jeff is too experienced as a lyricist to address that subject directly, which would makes these songs either too obvious or simply exploitive—the emotion overpowering the music. Instead, he writes around the crisis, transforming the travails of love and commitment into sharp, deceptively sunny hooks. “Low Key” and “I’ll Sing It” continue the subdued power-pop of Wilco’s most recent albums, but the songs are distinguished by the more austere palette of drums and guitar.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s no reason it needs to be a double album. Reportedly, the elder Tweedy penned 90 tunes, but pared it down to a somewhat more manageable 20. But this isn’t <i>Being There, </i>whose two sides obviously commented on and complicated each other. Instead, it’s more like <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10219-sky-blue-sky/"">Sky Blue Sky</a>, </i>both in its aggressive breeziness and its repetition occasionally curdling into tedium. The sprawl is less generous than it is indulgent, rendering the album more intimidating and less accessible than it should be. Only Jeff and Spencer can comprehend the full implications of these songs; the rest of us can grasp them only generally. Perhaps, given the story behind the album, that’s exactly what they intended.</p></div>"|19682.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19682-tweedy-sukierae/|7.3|Stephen M. Deusner

The formula may be dead simple—a four-to-the-floor beat plus a handful of shadows and metal shavings—but the proportions are always in flux. And as they shift, so does the music's relationship to the dancefloor; so do its imaginative possibilities. Last September, the British producer JR Seaton told <a href=""http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/magazine/call-super-on-laurent-garnier-and-having-a-career-in-reverse"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Red Bull Music Academy</a>, ""I can probably see myself making stuff that is less to do with clubs in the future."" He had been living in Berlin for four years, and while the city's techno community had drawn him to the city, he was circumspect about the way that club music's strictures can hinder an artist's development. Just a year later, his prediction is already coming true: after a string of EPs that established him as a clever, capable techno producer—part interpreter, part torchbearer—his debut album as Call Super turns sharply away from dancefloor functionality and towards headier expressions.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It's still body music, particularly if you turn it up loud enough that it gets ahold of your ribcage. But it's not so much party music, necessarily. The first thing you may notice is the relative scarcity of four-to-the-floor kicks; there's plenty of pulse running through <i>Suzi Ecto</i>, but it moves in fits and starts. Seaton's obvious affinity for classic electro is a factor, but these aren't the textbook whipcrack rhythms of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1149-drexciya/"">Drexciya</a>. They're softened up and sanded down; there are few grooves here, just bursts. Many of the drum sounds, like the dry, boxy toms of ""Okko Ink"", sound like they come from a Wurlitzer on the fritz, and even the most regular beats come across like metronomes buried deep in a pile of leaves. In ""Fold Again at Last"", an unsteady rhythm of glassy, conga-like tones is <span>all but drowned out by metallic locust buzz.</span></p>
<p class=""p1"">Ah yes, that buzz: <span>the whole album is alive with it.</span> Seaton has talked about the way his creative process puts the signal chain front and center—that is, his compositional style is less a matter of putting beats and notes in neat rows than generating electronic sounds and sending them careening through a series of effects. It's part alchemical reaction, part Rube Goldberg contraption, and one side effect of his method is the omnipresent crackle and hiss. Not all hums are created equal, however, and it's a sign of Seaton's careful approach to sound design that his buzz sings in a way that's very different from, say, the flat, affectless hiss of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28985-actress/"">Actress</a>. Indeed, while his gunked-up machine aesthetics relate to contemporaries like Actress, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30732-lukid/"">Lukid</a>, and the L.I.E.S. stable of basement-rave noiseniks, what distinguishes <i>Suzi Ecto</i> is its sparkling clarity. There are tiny chirping noises everywhere, like a forest full of birds and crickets, all made out of metal. Gloomy, abstracted electronic music rarely sounds so insanely detailed; for all its haphazard qualities, everything feels carefully, even obsessively, crafted. </p>
<p class=""p1"">It's a wonderfully penumbral set, sumptuously grayscale in a way that gives its rare bursts of color all the more impact. In ""Okko Ink"", a snippet of saxophone seems to have been rolled out on waterlogged tape and tacked up in the background, and in ""Sulu Sekou"", there's a melancholic clarinet melody that faintly recalls Djivan Gasparyan's ""I Will Not Be Sad in This World"". It's almost incongruous, this Fourth World outburst nestled among the metal shards, except that it's not, and that, in turn, is a testament to the breadth of Seaton's vision for techno. He's created the most evocative sound world that the genre has seen this year, and the peak-time dancefloor's loss is our gain.</p></div>"|19734.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19734-call-super-suzi-ecto/|7.7|Philip Sherburne

In the intervening years, the band's members have been involved with similarly groaning and lurching post-rock side projects, but even guitarist Mark Nelson's notable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3238-pan-american"">Pan American</a> hasn't quite filled the gap that the trio's grandiose records left behind. Now, for the first time in thirteen years<i>,</i> Nelson and bassist Robert Donne are back together as Anjou. Their self-titled debut holds up to the doomy strains of their pioneering act's best work and defies direct comparison thanks to the clattering efforts of virtuoso drummer Steven Hess.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Like later Labradford efforts, Anjou's sonic bedrock largely consists of wavering ribbons of syrupy synth pads. But where Nelson's earlier records used distended drones in service of songs, Anjou aims for something far more alien. ""Sighting"", for example, relies on little more than the glacial ooze of several slowly keyboard lines to craft a landscape far more foreign than even Labradford's latent Popol Vuh tendencies; it's full of slow, aquatic groans that place it outside  the contemporary boundaries of what a <a href=""http://www.kranky.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kranky</a>-signed act often sounds like. Though ""Specimen Question"" is built around snowcapped synth waves that wouldn't sound out of place on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"">Tim Hecker</a> record, and ""Inclosed"" features the sort of jittery noise that's come to define the recent output of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3935-stars-of-the-lid/"">Stars of the Lid</a>'s Adam Wiltzie. Each track appends twitchy, garbled digital manipulations to the component synthesizer parts, crafting a thoroughly unhinged take on the the typically soporific strains of ambient music.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Hess, who's previously worked with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28801-locrain/"">Locrian</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz"">Fennesz</a>, helps set Anjou further apart from their contemporaries. Just as the record seems content to lapse entirely into somnambulant keyboard exercises, Hess's distorted percussion scurries into the mix; on ""Sighting"", the glossy synth drones give way to an anxious clatter that evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a>'s abstract drum programming, and the distant digital gridworks of ""Backsight"" call to mind the amorphous throb that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a> often employ to terrifying effect. Despite how often his jittery concussive rattles make their way into the record, each instance remains uniquely volatile and otherworldly. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Throughout their careers, Nelson and Donne have always been cautious of overcrowding their frigid compositions, at the occasional risk of landing on the wrong side of the line between meditative and monotonous. On the whole, <i>Anjou</i> is similarly thrifty and minimal in its instrumental and tonal choices, but with the addition of Hess' floor tom fire bombs and delirious, kaleidoscopic noise bursts, the new duo have given drive and purpose to their often opiated work. </p></div>"|19732.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19732-anjou-anjou/|6.8|Colin Joyce

Last year he released a <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00AG4745Y/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Greatest Hits</a> </i>compilation, and <i>I’ve Been to Many Places</i> also mines his past, presenting solo piano versions of songs he previously performed with groups. Look closer, though, and it turns out both records are tied to the present. <i>Greatest Hits</i> encompasses recent history, culling his <a href=""http://www.thirstyear.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thirsty Ear</a> output from 2000 on, and <i><span>I’ve Been to Many Places </span></i>has an immediacy that eschews sentimental reflection. Pulsing and bubbling with focused drive, the record focuses more on where Shipp’s mind is at the moment than where it’s been in the past.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">On </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;""><i>I’ve Been to Many Places</i>, it sounds like Shipp received a shot of B-12 before recording, as </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">sifting through his past has apparently re-energized his present-day self, giving him potent launching points from which to chart untrodden paths. Even when he covers well-worn classics like ""Summertime"" and ""Where Is the Love?""—standards that have been stretched to the point that there’s no elastic left—Shipp somehow unearths treasures buried in their familiar ring. In that way, his playing recalls the rapid-fire tangents that guitarist </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29205-bill-orcutt/"">Bill Orcutt</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> ventured on his 2013 all-covers album </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18541-bill-orcutt-a-history-of-every-one/"">A History of Every One</a></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But compared to Orcutt’s penchant for off-key dissonance, Shipp hews to a more melodic range, which contributes to the impressive nature of </span><i>I’ve Been to Many Places</i><span>. The music possesses a bracing freshness due to Shipp’s singular method of expression; he jumps up and down phrases, darts in and out of chord changes, and splits notes into branches so quickly that it can prove dizzying. There’s a sense that the distance between his thought and actions is constantly approaching zero, and Shipp has claimed in regards to his music that “You are directly listening to my brain waves,"" a sentiment nicely summed in the title of ""Brain Stem Grammer"".</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">It may sound like </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">I’ve Been to Many Places </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">is a frantic, exhausting sprint, but despite the fact that Shipp’s brain is operating in high gear throughout, the album has as many moments of calm and restraint as it does clusters of machine-gun activity. On halting cuts like ""Pre-Formal"" and ""Symbolic Access"", Shipp’s deliberate chords slowly separate until there’s real, palpable silence between them. His reverent take on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/798-john-coltrane/"">John Coltrane</a>’s ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naima"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Naima</a>"" seems to fade into itself, so when his runs get faster and pricklier, a core gentleness remains. That dual effect—the feeling of still beauty inside busy expression—permeates much of </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">I’ve Been to Many Places,</span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> but regardless of tempo, Shipp's sense of thoughtfulness is constant.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Crucially, Shipp never allows any moment to feel arch or pretentious. That’s not easy to avoid when revisiting past work, be it your own or someone else’s; the temptation exists to apply complicated techniques or conceptual frameworks as a way to transform originals, but as Shipp </span><a href=""http://www.bluefat.com/1406/Matthew_Shipp.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">explained</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> recently, “I’m not exactly sure what’s going through my head when I interpret these songs...There might be an agenda on my part, but it gets murky where the actual conscious agenda is coming from.” </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">As a result, all the deconstructions and rebuildings on </span><i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">I’ve Been to Many Places </span></i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">are more visceral than theoretical, and you don’t have to know anything about jazz modes or music theory to drown yourself in Shipp’s waves—which </span><span>explains why the album’s best moment is its straightest. Shipp takes two stabs at </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberta_Flack"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Roberta Flack</a><span> and </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donny_Hathaway"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Donny Hathaway</a><span>’s '70s hit </span><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Is_the_Love"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Where Is the Love?”</a>,<span> and the first runs straight through the verses and choruses in just 90 seconds, injecting them with a gallon of adrenaline. In formal terms, it’s an anomaly—nowhere else does Shipp stick so tightly to his borrowed script—but as he turns momentum into emotion, packing many moods into what seem like nano-seconds, Shipp perfectly captures what makes </span><i><span>I’ve Been to Many Places </span></i><span>so exciting to listen to.</span></p></div>"|19713.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19713-matthew-shipp-ive-been-to-many-places/|7.8|Marc Masters

The project involves bassist/singer Sera Timms (known for her moving contributions to the now-defunct desert doom outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27792-black-math-horseman/"">Black Math Horseman</a>) and established metal journalist Jason Bennett, so Ides of Gemini face an amplified level of scrutiny on first approach. Their initial offerings shook black metal, sludge, post-rock, and plenty of psychedelia out onto an atmospheric doom template, and 2012’s amalgamous <i>Constantinople</i> silenced (or, at least, shushed) skeptics handily. The band has since enjoyed an impressive amount of success and have showed no signs of slowing down; the issue they face at this point is that too often they’ve come across as the Sera Show, as her compatriots are stuffed into the role of ""backing band"" through the sheer force of the singer’s talent.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">With <i>Old World New Wave</i>, they attempt to create a more balanced palate, but in the end it's still tough to compete with a voice like Timms', which is at once airy and grounded, verging upon operatic power when the mood strikes her (imagine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23583-stevie-nicks/"">Stevie Nicks</a> suspended in a lightless void). As her own solo project Black Mare proved, high, sustained notes are Timms' bread and butter—but she’s more than capable of dipping low into throatier territory, too. Drummer Kelly Johnston-Gibson’s voice floats in upon occasion to add ethereal backing whispers, melding with Timms’ for a gorgeous chorale effect. Her minimalistic drumming remains just as understated, though her confidence and prowess have both increased considerably.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The dreamy nature of Ides of Gemini's music doesn’t require much technical flair, and it sometimes seems that the rhythm section is content to take a backseat to its flashier fellows. On <i>Old World New Wave</i>, this approach works; with its halting central riff and martial beat, the insistent pace of album highlight ""The Adversary"" is as aggressive as the band gets, as bass and drums intertwine in the shadows elsewhere. There are plenty of diverse ideas floating around on this album, but save for a few standouts, these songs tend to gently fade into one another. They need something bigger to push them further—more sound, more power, more <i>band</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Timms’ bass nods along gently beneath Bennett’s more adventurous riffs; his guitar work may not steal the spotlight, but it does take a commanding role, ushering in lush tones that often, intentionally or not, recall the icy sensuality of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31700-beastmilk/"">Beastmilk</a> or bombastic post-rock dynamics. There’s a fuller sense of cohesion on <i>Old World New Wave</i>, as the fat has been trimmed and the influences reined in, leaving Ides of Gemini with a firmer sense of who they are: an atmospheric heavy rock band with a powerhouse chanteuse and doomy inclinations.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The band's always flirted with the occult in both aesthetic and tone, eschewing the heavy-handed witchicisms preferred by some in favor of cultivating a lighter, more holistic aura. The ritualistic feel on ""May 22, 1453"" stems both from Timms’ stentorian delivery and the lyrics themselves, which circle around the lunar eclipse that some say predicted the fall of Constantinople. It’s a neat tie-in to the band’s debut, and only one of the album’s many arcane historical footnotes. The rumbling ""Fermemorde"" alludes to medieval vigilantes and political murder, while Timms’ dreamy croon on ""Seer of Circassia"" spills dreams of the ancient crossroads between Europe and the Far East. Ides of Gemini aren’t the kind of band that would typically sing about goats or gore, but the complex, often mystical lyrics are handled with care, underscoring the band’s otherwordly ambitions. Nonetheless, <i>Old World New Wave</i> hypnotizes and intrigues, but the album often leaves the listener wanting more.</p></div>"|19721.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19721-ides-of-gemini-old-world-new-wave/|6.0|Kim Kelly

They’re one of the last remnants of a time when people still used the word “buzz band” to describe up-and-comers, often applied to playful, savvy, photogenic acts that served as a bridge between chillwave’s deconstruction of guitar-based music and the refurbishing of indie as a pop and R&amp;B-based idiom.</p>

The past three years have been marked by a terrible, debilitating van accident and minor successes unrelated to <i>In Heaven</i>: early single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12012-meet-the-frownies/"">“Meet the Frownies”</a> was <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpugK0RpEaU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sampled by </a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, while Estella subbed in for Leighton Meester in the Kickstarter-funded <i>Veronica Mars</i> movie. Within the first five minutes, Estella admits, “Finding out the actual year/ Made me realize how much happier I was not knowing.”</p>
<p>In any other year, the album art for <i>Mr Twin Sister </i>would be likened to a demo and taken as foreshadowing of a raw, plaintive reintroduction, a negation of what came before. In 2014, though, it looks a hell of a lot like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18172-kanye-west-yeezus""><i>Yeezus</i></a> cover, and while <i>Mr Twin Sister</i> is pretty much the exact opposite of that record’s harsh and uncompromising sound, it is similarly fashion-forward, an amplification of what preceded it and proof that “DIY” doesn’t necessarily have to mean “lo-fi.” Opener “Sensitive” takes two minutes to fade in from a gorgeous blur of whirled synths and chiming ambient sounds, and once its supple, seductive beat drops, Mr Twin Sister blind you with their newfound taste for aggressive opulence. Throughout, <i>Mr Twin Sister</i> is every kind of luxury<span>—</span>it’s more pillowy <i>and</i> firm than the spindly, spiky dance-pop of their past, crystalline on the outside <i>and</i> glittery on the inside, a snowglobe of a Times Square celebration.</p>
<p><i>Mr Twin Sister</i> sounds flawless, and the fact that they co-produced the album and put it out on their own label aligns with a lyrical streak of independence that runs throughout. A withering dismissal of aggressive men set to assured, lolling pop-funk, “Rude Boy” inverts the dynamic of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5310-rihanna"">Rihanna</a> song of the same name, addressed most directly to narcissists and pickup artists using any public space as a sexually-charged proving grounds. But considering the band’s retreat from indie rock’s buzz-making machinery, the more general barbs (""What makes you so certain that I wanna be forced to notice you?"") could be aimed at any kind of attention seeker or dude trying to blow smoke up your ass. Estella curtly sings, “I’ve got all the drinks that I can handle,” a statement that takes on a more sinister connotation during “In the House of Yes”. The title is a bait and switch—it’s uplifting, up-tempo and communal dance music, and the narrative takes place entirely within Estella’s head. It might be a reciprocation of their loan to Kendrick, fusing the uneasy cautionary tale of  <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13880-swimming-pools-drank/"">“Swimming Pools (Drank)”</a> and “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe”’s glorification of “me time.” Dancing alone in her room, Solo cup in hand, Estella jokes, “Now that I’ve had two or three/ I can get a little free,” and that taste of freedom leads to four, six, and eventually, a quick spiral to the floor. The perfect night out would actually take away everything involved with ""going out,"" and “In the House of Yes” is an escape from the world and its surrounding problems.</p>
<p>In spite of the disparate situations presented, both “Rude Boy” and “In the House of Yes” are unified by a desire to have some time to one’s self, to figure out what you really want out of life. “Out of the Dark” and “Twelve Angels” follow suit in a more confrontational and direct manner and underline the intent of Mr Twin Sister’s androgynous rename. Amidst the thick, liquid groove of the former, Estella observes and admires women who can naturally put on lipstick, a skirt, and a smile, but its chorus calls into question what “the dark” actually is, and whether the song is meant as a means of shedding more than social anxiety<span>: </span>“I am a woman/ But inside I’m a man/ And I want to be as gay as I can.”</p>
<p>This idea is presented even more literally on “Twelve Angels”, where Eric Carmona takes on the role of a bar-hopping woman in drag. Unfortunately, the band actually plays things too straight, utilizing the most common forms of electro dehumanization—that is, pitch-shifted and doubled vocals getting tossed down into a metallic airlock. In terms of topic, tone, execution, you name it, it’s perfectionist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10439-silent-shout-deluxe-edition/""><i>Silent Shout</i></a> homage. But the derivation makes it a strange fit into such an otherwise idiosyncratic record; immediately after, the instrumental “Medford” serves as a bridge to “Crime Scene”, an acoustic sunrise where the record comes to an abrupt, but satisfying closure.</p>
<p>But <i>Mr Twin Sister</i> doesn't play out as a narrative arc as much as it does like a lifelike, disconnected series of situations. It isn’t a record about being young and love, just one about being romantic in all senses of the word. Its intentions are put most bluntly on the emotional and literal centerpiece <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17030-mr-twin-sister-blush/"">“Blush”</a><span>, when Estella sings, </span>“Is there even a real me/ Or am I just a series of nights?” The band evokes the most sentimental idea of city nightlife on a record full of them<span>—</span>a slowdance on a rooftop, overlooking the skyline, an intimate moment interrupted by saying something foolish and trying to define it: “Have you felt like you would always be alone?” With one line, Estella amplifies the underlying worry behind every feeling of isolation, joy, regret, and excitement that's expressed throughout <i>Mr Twin Sister</i>. But during the duration of “Blush”, the fleeting perfection of the moment makes that a concern for another time; for now, the night is young, and anything is possible.</p></div>"|19799.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19799-mr-twin-sister-mr-twin-sister/|8.1|Ian Cohen

In the past, his sumptuous, warbling melodrama has been able to serve as the framework for larger arrangements, as in his prior outfits <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4660-wolf-parade/"">Wolf Parade</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5021-swan-lake/"">Swan Lake</a>, as well as the minimalism sprinkled in his sometimes-solo projects <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4126-sunset-rubdown/"">Sunset Rubdown</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28467-moonface/"">Moonface</a>. Like Sunset Rubdown, Moonface began as Krug alone and eventually expanded to an entire band. After Moonface’s 2012 LP <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16495-moonface-with-siinai-heartbreaking-bravery/"">With Siinai: Heartbreaking Bravery</a> </i>(which, as advertised, was made with the Finnish band Siinai), the project was scaled back for 2013’s lonesome, voice-and-piano album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18764-moonface-julia-with-blue-jeans-on/"">Julia With Blue Jeans On</a></i>. Krug’s follow-up to <i>Julia</i> is the five-song EP <i>City Wrecker</i>, and it operates along the same compositional lines as its immediate predecessor. It was also, like <i>Julia</i>, written and recorded in his temporarily adopted home of Helsinki, and it reflects that same sense of frigid displacement. Krug has the ability to stretch himself, but here, he’s chosen not to, and it sounds like a certain stiffness has set in with regards to his songwriting.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, <i>City Wrecker</i> puts Krug through his paces. The most demanding of the EP’s five songs, “Daughter of a Dove”, is nearly 11 minutes long; the song right before it, “Helsinki Winter 2013”, clocks in at over eight. “Daughter” is the showpiece of the EP, a marathon of cascading runs on the keys broken up by clusters of chords that attack and decay in rapid cycles. Still, he plays with an audible slouch, as if entire galaxies of regret rest on his shoulders: “There is a fallen tree against a perfect January snow/ And that’s as spiritual as I need to be.” Just as it seems Krug is taking the Scandinavian pagan black-metal route, he adds, “So when they said turn up the kick drum, turn up the snare/ I turned away to see my baby put a flower in her hair.” “Daughter” is also <i>City Wrecker</i>’s most embroidered track; in addition to piano, the song’s slow crescendo is built on a flood of crystalline synths, like water swirling under the ice. “Helsinki Winter 2013” is more delicate and less bombastic, a demonstration of Krug’s classical prowess in which he sings, “You belong where you are found/ Overseas, underground.” Coming from a Finland-residing Canadian transplant, it’s a little on the nose, but no less arresting because of it.</p>
<p>“The Fog” doesn’t do much to help dispel the “cold album made in a cold place” cliché that <i>City Wrecker </i>evokes, but Krug, as always, is self-aware to the point of pain. The song trembles and reverberates, with synths that erupt and flutter like blossoms bursting out of a snowfall; it’s vague, without dramatic chord changes or much of a vocal dynamic, and as such cultivates too much of a sedative numbness. Unlike <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28685-perfume-genius/"">Perfume Genius</a>’ Mike Hadreas, who has struck gold in the past with the same implements used on <i>City Wrecker</i>, Krug doesn’t insert enough tonal distance between his instrument and his voice, which is evident on “Running in Place With Everyone”. The tune resembles a finger exercise mashed up with monotone poetry; it’s pretty, but when Krug coos the song’s title in the chorus, his energy level sounds less kinetic than it does spent.</p>
<p>“The city fell into a sort of boring ruin,” Krug confesses on <i>City Wrecker</i>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4lY7OCw4ik"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>. He’s singing about Montreal, his longtime home, and the lassitude of guilt and longing practically leaks from his lungs. It’s an anthem for burned bridges and scorched earth, as well as the warmest, most flesh-and-blood moment of the EP. His melody is limited, but it makes the most of its cramped, claustrophobic clutch of notes. Where <i>Julia</i> filled almost every available space with either emotional fullness or palpable absence, <i>City Wrecker</i> feels pinched and constrained; the former was a drain to listen to in the best possible way, while this new one<i> </i>only occasionally breaks the skin.</p></div>"|19817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19817-moonface-city-wrecker-ep/|6.8|Jason Heller

But then, the gatekeepers of tradition need us to believe rock is dying in order to keep selling us a new resurrection narrative, like any consumer product in the mature phase of its life cycle and in need of a good marketing hook. But the audience for rock music never disappeared, it merely pluralized. Classic-rock radio may still play Black Sabbath alongside the Eagles and the Police, but the modern-day descendants of those bands are now funneled through discrete radio formats that serve different demographics. When you consider the combined festival-filling fanbases for metal, indie, and new country (and whatever derisive invented subgenre you’d apply to bands like Magic!), there’s still a healthy demand for songs played on plugged-in guitars and backed by bass, drums, and (budget permitting) pyro. Rock may no longer be the center of popular culture, but it still occupies vast amounts of space around it. When purists lament its supposed death, what they’re really lamenting is not so much the disappearance of guitar-strapping bands as a dearth of ones we can all believe in. </p>
<p>Still, this circumstance has never stopped the British music press from making a weekly sport of anointing new saviors for the country to rally around. And with Royal Blood, they've hit the jackpot: the Brighton bass-and-drums duo have swiftly become the most universally deified emergent UK rock band since the Arctic Monkeys first thawed out a decade ago. (Perhaps not coincidentally, Royal Blood share management with the Monkeys, whose drummer Matt Helders famously endorsed the then-unknown band through a t-shirt shout-out at Glastonbury last year.) Royal Blood’s self-titled album debuted at No. 1 in the UK last month and was nominated for the Mercury Prize shortly thereafter; now that they’re already duking it out on the top of the charts with the likes of Sam Smith and Ed Sheeran a mere year after their formation, Royal Blood are, for many young Britons, not just The Only Band That Matters, but The Only Band, period.</p>
<p>It’s not as if Royal Blood have been actively advertising their messianic qualities; if anything, they’ve been <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB3enPzzVEc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">quick to defuse any such hyperbole</a>. And yet, a little self-aggrandizing swagger would go a long way in making Royal Blood seem like they have any aspirations beyond just cranking out proficient assembly-line riffage as if they’re playing a live-action reenactment of <i>Rock Band</i>. Though Royal Blood confine themselves to a limited instrumental palette, the issue here isn’t so much a uniformity of sound: frontman Mike Kerr feeds his brawny basslines through a NASA-worthy dashboard of effects pedals that can make it sound alternately like he’s shredding on an SG or coaxing alien frequencies out of a Korg. And no doubt, Kerr and stickman Ben Thatcher can lock into a crushing, contorted groove with a telepathic sense of connectivity (like with the epileptic lurch of lead single “Out of the Black”), as if drop-and-dragging their favorite bits from the Led Zeppelin, Jack White, and Queens of the Stone Age discographies into a GarageBand file to build the ultimate indestructible riff. It’s the pro-forma songwriting that transpires between those brontosaurus blasts that ultimately proves problematic. By using their muscular might to prop up otherwise featherweight tunes, Royal Blood have effectively built themselves a castle and furnished it with IKEA.  </p>
<p>Kerr has been particularly vocal about his reverence for Josh Homme, and it’s as much for his singing as his fretwork; <a href=""http://www.clashmusic.com/features/in-conversation-royal-blood"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as he told <i>Clash</i> magazine</a> earlier this year, “Queens of the Stone Age’s <i>Songs for the Deaf </i>was a massive album for me. That album’s so melodic <i>and </i>so huge, without any screaming.” Accordingly, Kerr’s smooth, steady voice serves as a cool counterpoint to the rockocalypse erupting around him, but unlike Homme’s arch, playfully effeminate delivery, it’s less a subversive device than a subservient one, unable to elevate songs like ""Careless"" and ""Ten Tonne Skeleton"" beyond their humourless, all-too-familiar expressions of blue-balled frustration.</p>
<p>The best a young band working with such a well-worn template can hope for is to imprint their own peculiar personality upon it—see: the White Stripes’ theatrical vamping or Alex Turner’s keen, colloquial, observational wit. There are promising flashes of that sort of attitude here: “Figure It Out” and “Loose Change”—not coincidentally the two songs that bust out of the band’s usual slow-motion boogie and accelerate into feverish finales—find Kerr exhibiting a more flamboyant, cocksure pose he should parade more often. But Royal Blood have a long way to go before cultivating a mythos of their own, outfitting mid-tempo chugs like “You Can Be So Cruel” and “Little Monster” with generic girl-done-me-wrong/girl-do-me-right lyrics that readily conform to the thematic expectations of blooze-rock rather than make any attempt to redefine them. That such an unassuming, workmanlike outfit has been so immediately lionized is ultimately less a measure of Royal Blood’s exceptionalism than rock'n'roll’s overblown inferiority complex: If this is all it takes to save rock, then it really couldn’t have been hurting that much to begin with. </p></div>"|19814.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19814-royal-blood/|5.6|Stuart Berman

Diagramming parallax is the effect whereby the apparent position or direction of an object differs when viewed from slightly different vantage points. This recently reissued 2x12” set, which showed up briefly in late 2011 before dropping out of sight for the last three years, now pops back into view after some time has passed, and we hear it from a different perspective.</p>
<p>When <i>Vibe 2</i> was originally released on the Washington, D.C. dance imprint Future Times, it acted as handy overview of what was happening in the DIY U.S. dance music underground at the moment (if Willie Burns or Terrekke had made an appearance, it would have been near complete), while also showing the label’s wide and eclectic reach. The label’s sound and aesthetic, as displayed by its primary acts Protect-U and Beautiful Swimmers (one-half of which is producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17698-maxmillion-dunbar-house-of-woo/"">Maxmillion Dunbar</a>), is tricky to definitively nail down. There are traces of Chicago acid and Detroit house, New Age wind chimes, the disco-not-disco of Arthur Russell, early '80s African synths, cosmic jazz and jazzercise, jheri-curled modern soul, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11374-funky-nassau-the-compass-point-story-1980-1986/"">Funky Nassau</a>’s pliant and plasticine grooves, and more, all of it in a delightful jumble.</p>
<p>Across a succinct nine tracks that never wear out their welcome, the set does disco edits, deep house, gravity-free synthscapes, and acid gurgles to pleasing effect. <i>Vibe 2</i> also features four contributions from future L.I.E.S. artists back when the imprint had but three releases to its name, a contribution from the prolific <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17192-techno-primitivism/"">Juju &amp; Jordash</a> when the duo were just hitting their stride, as well as some excellent up-and-coming producers operating out of Paris and Berlin. It’s definitely the only time you’ll read in a review that music from L.I.E.S. label boss Ron Morelli is “funky” and “soulful,” as is the case on the lead-off track “Comeback Dust”. Featuring coos and a sampled plea of “please!” as a house beat echoes all around it, the track is an outlier in that Morelli’s tastemaking (as well as his own solo work) have favored industrial noise and grit ever since.  </p>
<p>Then L.A.-based beatdigger turned NYC transplant Tom Noble follows that up with sharp and boxy drum machines, spindly funk guitar, and the woozy boogie keyboards of “Malaco”. With his most recent disco gospel single “Holding On” making its way into Theo Parrish’s crates, it shows that Noble’s ear for a vintage yet modern groove was in place from the start. Frenchman Alexis Le-Tan takes an obscure French synth-pop confection replete with “Tour de France”-era Kraftwerk huffing-and-puffing and twists its synths into a delirious and highly dramatic cosmic-disco track. </p>
<p>While Steve Summers does more subtle and drifting minimal techno today on his Confused House imprint, here he delivers a Mr. Fingers-like cut called “Uncollected Grooves”. And fellow L.I.E.S. alum Steve Moore delivers a slowly unfurling analog synth epic “Volatile Memory” that straddles beatific Balearic and unsettling horror soundtrack, never quite settling on one or the other. A nimble yet funky track from Hunee reminds me that while he’s remained busy as a DJ, little has been heard from the producer since 2011. To put a bow on this comp, the Future Times crew end things on the disco tip, screwing down and dubbing out an old Joe Simon disco track until he sounds a little bit sleazier, purring “I feel sexy” and continuing to emanate such a vibe.</p></div>"|19803.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19803-various-artists-vibe-2/|7.8|Andy Beta

Enter Iron Reagan, a Richmond band composed of members from notable crossover thrash groups like <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Municipalwaste"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Municipal Waste</a> and Darkest Hour, who are the jellybean cowboy's latest invokers. While their sound places them as political punk in the vein of Wasted Youth or the Crucifucks, Iron Reagan's lyrical tendencies skew nihilstic and violent with a dash of odd humor. Where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/"" target=""_blank"">Black Flag</a> once instructed the crowd to “Rise Above”, Iron Reagan proudly declare, ""I Ripped That Testament a New Asshole”. It’s a shock-driven approach, sure, but when it comes to expressing displeasure with the status quo, have punks ever bothered to clean up nicely and say “please”?</span></p>
<p class=""p2"">The quintet's latest, <i>The Tyranny of Will</i>, is a thirty-two minute blitzkrieg that surges forth like the blood spurting from the politician's neck on the album cover. Iron Reagan stick to what they know best: firing off short, potent riffs at a workmanlike pace, and letting the listener sort out the mess for themselves. In interviews, frontman Tony Foresta hasn’t tried to hide the fact that he and the rest of the guys are, largely, winging it: “We suffer from A.D.D. pretty hard—almost everyone in the band,” he revealed recently to <a href=""http://metalassault.com/Interviews/2014/09/08/vocalist-tony-foresta-discusses-new-iron-reagan-album-the-tyranny-of-will/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one reporter</a> with a laugh, “so we make music that comes across faster, and more to the point.""</p>
<p class=""p2"">In other words, they’ve got the punk mindset already hard-wired, and so it naturally follows that nine of the album’s songs blow by in under a minute. On the album's most immediate cut, “Eyeball Gore”,power chords stamp and stomp as the band make their impassionately sadistic demands: “All we want is eyeball gore RIGHT NOW!” Think of the song as the album's elevator pitch: the violent fervor of protest music used to incite social change <i>and </i>knife parties. Of course, there are jabs at the cops and the one-percenters (see the hilarious “U Lock the Bike Cop”, in which Foresta warns a policeman that his fixie’s going to get jacked). Most of the time, however, Iron Reagan simply release their furor with no target in particular. “Broken Bottles”,  a twisted take on Adolescents-style skate punk, captures the sentiment of that band’s essential cut “Bloodstains” and leaves it to simmer, resulting in a chugging frenzy topped off with a tottering solo. Sometimes, they can’t seem to tell exactly who or what they’re mad at; “Your Kid’s an Asshole”, short and pointless, might as well be the musical equivalent of a typo-laden insult from an email exchange between two soccer moms.</p>
<p class=""p1""> <span style=""font-size: 15px;"">A significant portion of </span><i>The Tyranny of Will </i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">was written while Iron Reagan toured with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23228-gwar/"">GWAR</a>, not too long before Dave Brockie (aka Oderus Ungurus) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56349-gwar-give-oderus-urungus-a-viking-funeral-at-gwar-b-q-video/"">passed</a>. According to the band, the late frontman lent Iron Reagan some inspiration, going as far to contribute gory gross-out ideas for the album, and listening to </span><i>The Tyranny of Will</i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">, a number of similarities emerge between the two entities. Foresta’s podium-side barking bears kinship to Brockie’s theatrical delivery, and while the former has yet to perform in blood-soaked costumes exposing prosthetic genitalia, he plays a comedic villain with aplomb. “I’d rather just set fire/ Than be left to die,” he threatens on “Miserable Failure”, his energy essential in keeping the group's bare-bones, repetitive fretwork fresh. </span></p>
<p class=""p2"">For diehard thrash heads who possess patience and a sick sense of humor, <i>The Tyranny of Will </i>should prove satisfying; most listeners, though, will probably find the record's attention-challenged songwriting grating by the fifteen-minute mark, and as the album plays on, the pummeling punchlines don’t hit as hard as they're intended to. As is the case with most overstuffed hardcore albums, <i>The Tyranny of Will </i>lends itself well to a cherry-picking approach; keep some riffs and ideas, and toss the ones that don’t stick. Essentially, it's ample license to take part in some musical mudslinging—and The Man could always stand to take a good mud-and-blood pie to the face. </p></div>"|19620.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19620-iron-reagan-the-tyranny-of-will/|6.2|Zoe Camp

This Ryan Adams releases one-offs like the Finger’s <i>We Are Fuck You / Punk’s Dead Let’s Fuck</i> and the metal sci-fi concept album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/38853-ryan-adams-releases-fully-realized-sci-fi-metal-concept-album-orion/""><i>Orion</i></a>—most of which are funny-ha-ha for one or two listens, then are forever shelved.</p>
<p>Because they both fit a bit too perfectly into our preconceptions of selling out and keeping it real—concepts so old-fashioned in 2014 that they’re difficult to even type with a straight face—superficially, these two doppelgangers ought to exist in direct and even deadly opposition to one another. It’s not hard to imagine Ryan Adams the punk gobbing on Ryan Adams the serious singer/songwriter, and who wouldn’t buy tickets to see that? But the reality is, thankfully, much more complicated. Each Ryan Adams needs the other in order to survive in the music business; soundtrack placements, after all, bankroll hardcore EPs, which in turn provide a creative outlet for the kind of aggression and humor that aren’t typically prized by the roots-rock crowd.</p>
<p>These two Ryans duke it out on two of his new releases. The aptly titled <i>Ryan Adams</i> is a Ryan Adams album, not too far removed from his last few LPs<i> </i>even if it jettisons the twangy Americana for a different, darker, but no less historically grounded sound. The EP <i>1984</i> is the first in his Pax-Am Singles Series (which are essentially 7-inch billboards for his Hollywood studio) and lives up to its name by evoking the hardcore punk of the mid ‘80s. While these two releases seem to represent very different sides of the notoriously multi-faceted artist, they actually have a great deal in common. Both mine the past for inspiration and allow that inspiration to determine more of how the music sounds than it should, and both prove that there are no fine lines separating the various Ryan Adamses.</p>
<p>Released as a limited-edition 7” that quickly sold out in roughly an hour, <i>1984</i> wants to play like a super-obscure hardcore EP that you might find in a crate at the back of an ancient record store, stuck with bubblegum to the back of Negative Approach’s <i>Tied Down</i>. The playing is fast and furious, the tone predictably nostalgic, as Adams indulges his taste for musical extremes. Yet, for all its aggression and speed, the EP ultimately sounds like a bunch of catchy Ryan Adams songs played at twice the normal speed and truncated before they hit the two-minute mark. Slow them down, drag them out, and you’ve got a Cardinals album.</p>
<p>But the hardcore milieu imposes an intriguing set of restrictions on Adams, who played all the instruments himself. He knows the genre allots a very short amount of time to get his point across, so he arranges these songs to grab your attention quickly, either with a sharp guitar riff or an exaggerated vocal melody. He hits the first note of “What If You Were Wrong” almost before the song even starts, and he sings like he’s trying to outrun the scissoring guitars. ""Change Your Mind"" is all hook, condensed and concentrated, and “Rats in the Wall” flails wildly, barely holding together, until it explodes in a sample of broken glass. <i>1984</i> sounds like an exercise, a test to see if he can pare his songwriting down to its barest essentials: a straightforward lyrical sentiment, a catchy melody, and an off-the-cuff performance. Even though the EP ends up sounding repetitive and therefore much longer than its 15 minutes, Adams emerges as a careful craftsman with clear affection and reverence for the genre.</p>
<p>If that seat-of-his-pants release reveals Adams the punk as a serious artist, then this carefully planned self-titled album undercuts any self-seriousness he might possess as a singer/songwriter. On the cover of <i>Ryan Adams</i>, he looks perfectly stoned or possibly lobotomized, his hair exploding in the kind of bedhead bouffant that requires a lot of time and product. Even the title is delivered with a wink. Is that font <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reckless_(Bryan_Adams_album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bryan Adams Serif Bold</a>? Adams is too much of a rock nerd for that to be an accident, so it’s possible he’s trolling with a deliberately “bad” album cover for an album of well-crafted and well-behaved tunes released on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6300-norah-jones/"">Norah Jones</a>’ label.</p>
<p>If the packaging is suspicious, the music itself offers a nice twist on the singer/songwriter mode. This time around, he’s less interested in the blah folk rock of the 2011 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15907-ashes-fire/?utm_campaign=search&amp;utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=search-ac""><i>Ashes &amp; Fire</i></a>. In fact, with its murky production and throwback guitar sound, <i>Ryan Adams </i>sounds like it<i> </i>could have been recorded at any time between 1979 and 1987. There are period-specific nods to deep-cut Bryan Adams, Kenny Loggins, even Robbie Nevil and Richard fucking Marx. “Stay With Me” could be a synth-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9474-tom-petty/"">Tom Petty</a> tune, its snappy guitar theme recalling the Heartbreakers’ jangly dynamic, and “I Just Might” rustles up a rough guitar lick to conjure the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"">Springsteen</a> of ""Brilliant Disguise"". “Don’t wanna loose control, baby, I just might,” Adams sings in his best Bruce, but the song is so laden with specific references that it’s clear he’ll never have the chance to get too wild.</p>
<p>There aren’t your obvious touchstones, at least not for a guy sporting an Emperor backpatch on his denim jacket. Most of the time, Adams gets the sound just right without being too obvious about it, but some of these songs—specifically “Shadows” and “Let Go”—sound like they were written to fit this particular triangulation of influences. As a result, the rock-historical allusion rather than the music becomes an end in itself. On the other hand, <i>Ryan Adams </i>is a persuasively dark album, one defined by themes of struggle, instability, isolation, and regret. He sings like a man who knows something bad is going to interrupt each song. Adams may spend most of “Am I Safe” telling us that he’s having thoughts instead of telling us what those thoughts actually are, but that clipped acoustic strum conveys a potently jittery paranoia that says a lot more than the lyrics. On “Tired of Giving Up”, he admits that he’s “tired of giving up” and “tired of fighting,” as though this particular crisis offers no other options.</p>
<p>It seems impossible that Adams has never written a song called “My Wrecking Ball” before now, but that tune may be the best song on <i>Ryan Adams</i>, its austere arrangement conjuring the mood of a late-night drive to nowhere in particular. Musically, it recalls the directness and eloquence of <i>Heartbreaker</i> updated for 2014. “Hey, you’re my wrecking ball,” he sings, “won’t you come and maybe knock me down?” Perhaps he relishes the idea of romantic obliteration, perhaps he dreads it. But the song’s world-weariness is so intense that such destruction might actually revitalize him by giving him a chance to start over, build from the ground up, write, sing, and record with no preconceptions from himself, his fans, or anybody else. <i>Ryan Adams</i> may shed the confessional impulse in Adams' songwriting, but “My Wrecking Ball” plays like a deeply personal expression of creative paralysis and renewal. </p></div>"|19778.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19778-ryan-adams-ryan-adams1984-ep/|6.0|Stephen M.

Beginning with the supporting musicians that helped foster her experimental cabaret pop as AwRY in the early aughts and expanding outward to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30072-ymusic/"">yMusic</a>’s effervescent chamber music orchestrations on MBD’s last full-length, 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15942-all-things-will-unwind/""><i>All Things Will Unwind</i></a>, a sense of collaboration has become as essential to the My Brightest Diamond project as Worden's inimitably acrobatic voice. It’s fitting, then, that Worden has turned that mentality into methodology for follow-up <i>This Is My Hand</i>. Self-produced by Worden with support from keyboardist Zac Rae, <i>This Is My Hand</i> is an often successful exercise in percussive, jagged art-pop that explores themes of self-acceptance, sensuality, and community.</p>
<p>In a frustrating bit of organization, <i>This Is My Hand</i>’s most memorable moments are front loaded in its opening five songs. Lead single ""Pressure"", which begins with a galvanizing drumline from the Detroit Party Marching Band before stacking Worden's soaring vocals against a rhythmic horn section, is unique and oddly beautiful. ""Lover Killer"" employs handclaps and howls for a deceptively joyous meditation on our capacity for both affection and violence, while ""I Am Not the Bad Guy"" evokes an industrial version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"">St. Vincent</a> with its lurching swagger and pointed, imagistic lyrics (“I’m hungry, I won’t lie/ The cage, the bird, the open sky”). The bracing title track, however, is the true standout, as well as one of Worden’s finest moments. Through powerful repetition of the title’s opening phrase (“This is my…”) with distinct variations on body parts, ideas, and emotions (“fist,” “voice,” “heart,” “hate”, “sex,” etc.), the song elegantly unifies into an impassioned and inclusive rally call.</p>
<p>Where the beginning of <i>This Is My Hand</i> presents an invigorating progression of Worden’s sonic palette, the album winds down with a string of slower, ethereal oddities that blunt the concentrated pandemonium of its earlier tracks. ""So Easy"" and ""Resonance"" suffer a similar fate that much of <i>All Things Will Unwind</i> did in that they come and go with little to distinguish themselves, especially heard following the flourishing, self-assured bluster of the opening section. Still, despite uneven pacing, <i>This Is My Hand</i> works on a visceral level, conjuring Worden’s intended image of tribal, fireside collaboration through a rich diversity of texture, detail, and tone.</p></div>"|19797.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19797-my-brightest-diamond-this-is-my-hand/|7.0|Eric Torres

Often this innate form of expression can materialize into learning an instrument or honing a vocal skill, but not so for Sebastian Gainsborough. The Bristol native's Vessel project remains fixated on the possibilities of making and arranging his own noise, using the forms of dub and techno like a means to his esoteric ends instead of the impetus itself.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Released in 2012 through the increasingly experimental Tri Angle label, Gainsborough's debut album was conspicuously titled </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17286-order-of-noise/""><i>Order of Noise</i></a><span>. But referring to him as a ""noise artist"" or calling his music ""noise-techno"" wouldn't be entirely accurate, even if he does paint with many of the same grim colors. </span><i>Order of Noise</i><span> was more gauzy and mystical as it took on the producer's hometown sounds, as trip-hop, dubstep, and industrial were dissected and used as decorative references in its treacherous, fog-choked landscape. Ultimately, this worked best when Gainsborough was simply showing off his handiwork in well-crafted environments; any notion of moving through the space felt faint and illusory. For his second Tri Angle LP, Gainsborough's made another noise-specific techno record beholden to his remarkably generative skills with sound manipulation. His reliance on homespun methods of fabricating instruments gives </span><i>Punish, Honey</i><span> a distinctively raw and tactile identity.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The 2013 EP <i>Misery</i><i> Is a Communicable Disease</i><span> provides a better entry point to </span><i>Punish, Honey</i><span> than the cabalistic </span><i>Order of Noise</i><span>. The first full-blown iteration of stark, mechanically inclined techno that Gainsborough put to his name, the EP's three tracks accosted the listener with an unforgiving clamor, entirely unexpected from the Bristolian at the time. </span><i>Punish, Honey</i><span> comes across like that, too, and in much the same way. Gainsborough's source materials sound crude and primitive, like the din of reverb around each knotty crack of percussion is drawn from the cold, dry cave dwelling it was recorded in. He distills those prehistoric qualities into a fuel for the stone-grinding engine inside each incessant bassline and crushing stomp of a kick drum. Occasionally, Gainsborough takes a break from the machinery and tosses a few handfuls of granite dust into the air so we can watch it sparkle. </span><i>Punish, Honey</i><span> may not be the most hospitable of environments, but there's always a fascinating display working in its shadows.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The album is best taken as a document of unparalleled noise creation, an inconceivable world made from the everyday objects around us; Gainsborough has outdone himself here in terms of mastering this predominate craft. In this context, however, noise isn't everything, and structural refinement doesn't seem to be a priority for Gainsborough. Most of </span><i>Punish, Honey</i><span> pushes a sense of melody that—whether due to the instruments making the sounds, or the outsider mentality of the producer himself—is inherently off. The nauseous moans of ""Red Sex"" and ""Euoi""'s whiny racket become less palatable with each turn on the carousel that makes up Gainsborough's debased techno. This infatuation with musical ""wrong""-ness is a defining characteristic across the nine-track LP, so it's unfortunate that necessary counterbalances (compelling arrangement, emotional arc, memorable hooks) aren't consistently utilized.</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-02fd1b10-5c03-e34e-1b30-ccfff86d338b"">Perhaps such criticisms are of no concern to Gainsborough, though, because his approach does work staggeringly well when each disheveled factor is in alignment. ""Drowned in Water and Light"" recalls the full-moon majesty that made <i>Order of Noise</i> so alluring, rendering that haunted splendor aside lumbering rhythms and seismic heaves. The centerpiece of <i>Punish, Honey</i>, ""Anima"", sets a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"">Suicide</a>-sourced synth pattern against swarms of ghostly detritus, rolling drums, and omnipresent organ chords, a claustrophobic production that works because you feel it shift and expand while it churns. ""Kin to Coal"" operates on similar gears, but is fashioned in a lean, sinewy way with jackhammers and hacksaws. Unquestionably, Gainsborough's sonic ingenuity continues to be his greatest asset; his growth as an artist hinges on accepting that others can't always enjoy his noise as much as he does.</span></p></div>"|19710.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19710-vessel-punish-honey/|7.3|Patric Fallon

It’s a freedom from the burdens of authenticity, in other words, that makes an artist like Shintaro Sakamoto possible. The raunchy psych-rock Sakamoto played with his band Yura Yura Teikoku was, through its origins in San Francisco and London and Detroit, a authentic product of psychedelic and narcotic influence. Yet as Julian Cope explains in his study of Japanese psychedelia <i><a href=""http://www.japrocksampler.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Japrocksampler</a></i>, the Japanese heads who built upon and translated the post-<i>Nuggets</i> era into their own language, laying the groundwork for Sakamoto himself, most often eschewed drugs completely, opting for other avenues through which to get to the same dizzying musical highs. </p>
<p>As a solo artist, Sakamoto is so unconcerned with authenticity to a musical tradition that on record, he quite nearly disappears completely. On the 2012 LP <i>How to Live With a Phantom, </i>he mastered an ersatz lounge-pop that skewed as much portmortem as postmodern. The lightest, oft-cheesiest products of Western '50s and '60s pop—from the Free Design to French yé-yé and Martin Denny’s “exotica” soundscapes—have long appealed to Japanese record nerds for whom “soul” is often a very foreign concept, and Sakamoto is no exception. On his second solo album <i>Let’s Dance Raw,</i> he doubles down on his love for such sounds, assembling them into a whole that suggests as much the heady late '90s as the go-go '60s.</p>
<p>A slight shift from <i>Phantom</i>’s chippy disco guitar licks and smoky organs, <i>Raw </i>finds Sakamoto immersing himself in Hawaiian steel guitar, Brazilian cuica, and banjo—an instrument which, he suggests on “You Can Be a Robot, Too”, can be plucked and looped in a way that sounds like thousands of tiny gears operating in perfect concert. If there's any recognizable Western spirit animals for <i>Raw </i>(other than “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1st_9KudWB0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sleep Walk</a>”), it's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck"">Beck</a>—the heavy-lidded proto-serious iteration, that is, from 1998’s <i>Mutations</i>—and indie-pop gadabout and arranger-for-hire <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5473-sean-ohagan"">Sean O’Hagan</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1942-the-high-llamas/"">the High Llamas</a>, whose '90s LPs <i>Santa Barbara </i>and <i>Hawaii</i> absorbed the Americana ambitions of<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8485-van-dyke-parks/""> Van Dyke Parks </a>and ironed out the quirks, creating a heavily-stamped, pristine musical passport. Like Beck’s “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsY3n-ISDlw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tropicalia</a>”, <i>Raw</i> is a perfectly executed version of what Westerners might call global kitsch: a series of evocative tourist postcards showing sunny scenes from Rio and Honolulu.</p>
<p>What makes Sakamoto unique, though, is not simply his knack for turning the exotic West into a glimmering watercolor, or his capacity to craft a simple groove redolent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3941-steely-dan/"">Steely Dan</a>’s gaudy disco swan song <i>Gaucho</i>—though “Like an Obligation” more than qualifies—but doing so with the kind of fashionable indifference mastered by predecessors like Beck, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2207-grace-jones"">Grace Jones</a>, and the dazed, obsessive Yokohama teenagers wandering through Memphis in <i><a href=""http://www.papermag.com/uploaded_images/mystery_train.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mystery Train</a></i>. Yes, Sakamoto digs into countercultural sociology on “Obligation” and “Birth of the Super Cult”, two blunted treatises against the staid social structures that still dog much of Japanese society. But before we call him a prophet, let’s keep in mind his alternative: sliding “a small chip between your eyebrows” and becoming a robot. <span>Sakamoto has an odd way of working, sure, but it's also liberating: when you disregard authenticity as your compass, it’s amazing how far you can travel.</span></p></div>"|19714.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19714-shintaro-sakamoto-lets-dance-raw/|7.1|Eric Harvey

It's the official solo debut of the co-founder of the legendary indie-rock band the Clean; the group’s other main member, Hamish’s brother David Kilgour, has long been polishing his popcraft on his own, most recently on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19568-david-kilgour-and-the-heavy-eights-end-times-undone/""><i>End Times Undone</i></a>. But it’s taken Hamish this long—a third of a century after the Clean’s first records—to get around to making his presence definitively felt as a solo artist. And here he is, singing about his own imminent disappearance. Under his breath, of course. </p>
<p>“Hullabaloo”, at seven and a half minutes, is not only the lengthiest of <i>All Of It and Nothing</i>’s cuts, it encapsulates the album’s extremes. It starts out as a murky psych-folk. Halfway through, it’s clear that it’s become more of a drone. By song’s end, that drone has melted into a cosmic-jazz smear of reverb and drifting note-clusters, with random instruments ebbing and flowing through the vacuum. The phrase “ice cream cake” has never been uttered with more menace. Compared to David’s tight, immaculate, guitar-savvy compositions, Hamish sounds downright dizzy. It doesn’t even resemble Hamish’s own laidback vibe in his long-running project <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXyTDoSnT-Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Mad Scene</a>. But that disorientation is what makes the album so atmospheric. Well, that and tracks like “Rave Up (For the Yellow Dogs)”, a sawing, moaning, chanted mantra aided by slinky marimba that recalls Hamish’s work with Theo Angell four years ago on their all-raga album under the name <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TscD3vo1Gg0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Cloudcraft</i></a>. </p>
<p>Hamish dips into his past liberally on <i>All of It and Nothing</i>. The album was recorded by Gary Olson of the Mad Scene (and also of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2407-the-ladybug-transistor/"">The Ladybug Transistor</a>), although the rambling, off-kilter whimsy of “Going Out” and “Crazy Radiance” hew closer to Daniel Johnston’s cracked-glass vision of folk-pop. (The cover of <i>All of It and Nothing </i>, with its jumble of sketchy juvenilia, could even pass for one of Johnston’s.) Mostly, though, Hamish’s shambolic strumming and clumps of acidic imagery pick up the loose threads of <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK983gZfP6s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Clean Out of Our Minds</a></i>, the 1983 bedroom-made album he and David released in 1983 under the handle the Great Unwashed, as if the past 30 years never happened or simply didn’t matter.</p>
<p>Rather than forging something distinct and discreet with his first solo album, Hamish has cast his imagination backward and let it roam. On “Turn Around”, he seems to be making up the lyrics on the spot, freestyling in a mock-Lou Reed deadpan, “Self-nostalgic/ Avoid the tragic.” His voice sinks into the song, utterly committed to noncommittal. Still, it seems like something more ineffable than laziness is compelling him. “This is the last...”, he sings on the album’s final track, “The Last Song”, apparently unable to summon the wherewithal to complete his sentence. Then he continues, “…marks the end of this album/ And the journey isn’t over quite yet/ Mistakes were made.” Instead of self-deprecating, <i>All of It and Nothing</i> is a meditation on invisibility and absence, rendered both playfully and ominously in songs that erase themselves as they go along. Hamish muffles that message a little too often, but it’s all part of the vanishing act.</p></div>"|19761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19761-hamish-kilgour-all-of-it-and-nothing/|6.4|Jason Heller

But now that basically every entity in that sentence has been culturally marginalized, and the propeller churn of social media refuses to tolerate slow-burn marketing, the best—and, perhaps, only—way to get everyone talking about your record at once is to release it with no warning. </span>U2 being U2, they’ve taken that strategy one step over the line into indisputably queasy territory, aligning with their old friends Apple to insert their new album, <i>Songs of Innocence</i>, into all of our libraries without consent. By updating the old Columbia House Record Club scam to the digital age, U2 and their Cupertino buddies have created a new avenue of opt-out cultural transmission, removing even the miniscule effort it takes to go to a website and click “Download.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That U2 would willingly play corporate house band at a watch announcement to achieve this rollout in 2014 surprises exactly nobody; the album release was even framed by Bono himself as the 10th-anniversary celebration of a commercial. <span>But the insistent mode of distribution says a lot about the band’s addiction to attention in their 38th year. “Part of the DNA of this band has always been the desire to get our music to as many people as possible,” Bono wrote, and after the commercial squib of 2009’s gloomy <i>No Line on the Horizon</i>, everything about <i>Songs of Innocence</i> seems desperate to be the global, cultural “experience” fix U2 needs to survive, even if it means giving away the album for “free.” </span></span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Accordingly, the music itself aims for a one-size-fits-all, vaguely inspirational tone, with a lean approach to details despite the press kit assertion that it’s all “very, very personal.” So a song about Bono meeting his wife is given the non-committal title of “Song for Someone”, and a song called “The Troubles” isn’t a callback to the prolonged Northern Ireland conflict that inspired their first great song, but a bunch of self-pitying platitudes (which uses guest <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5734-lykke-li/"">Lykke Li</a> to mimic adult-contempo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1170-duran-duran/"">Duran Duran</a> hit “Come Undone”). Even Bono’s opening love letter to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16372-joey-ramone/"">Joey Ramone</a> is only given specificity by the title’s parenthetical, a generic “last night a [fill-in-the-blank] changed my life” tale that could be adapted to the idol of your choosing. It’s all emotional content left intentionally formless, vaingloriously hoping to fit around the experiences of millions.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Songs of Innocence</i> also continues a decade-long trend of U2 showing little interest in re-examining themselves as a band or as pop stars, the approach that sustained them artistically throughout the '90s. Despite jettisoning their Eno/Lanois/Lillywhite comfort zone in favor of Danger Mouse, Paul Epworth, and a host of other moderately intriguing producers, <i>Songs of Innocence</i> is perhaps the album where U2 most self-consciously plays itself—or more distressingly, risk causing a temporal paradox by swiping moves from mantle-carriers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/790-coldplay/"">Coldplay</a>, akin to time traveling to the future and sleeping with your own grandchild.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">A few promisingly weird moments, such as the eerily synthetic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys"">Beach Boys</a> chant at the start of “California (There Is No End to Love)” or the breathy rhythms of “Raised By Wolves”, are quickly diluted by stock verse/chorus structures. The watery disco-punk beats of “This Is Where You Can Reach Me Now” and “Volcano” are thin gruel for a band that once seemed aware of current pop trends, however ill-advised the attempts were to engage with them. Only “Sleep Like a Baby Tonight” manages to feel fresh from start to finish, with burbling synths and pillowy strings occasionally disrupted by the Edge at his fuzziest-sounding. Elsewhere, there seems to be barely any resistance to the gravity of doing what a U2 song is supposed to do and little else.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That gravity has a name, and it’s four letters long, and at this point even those letters are wearing sunglasses</span><span>. The two brief moments where Bono drops his global-rock-ambassador persona—the deranged, filtered first note of the “Raised by Wolves” chorus, the brief return of the “Lemon” falsetto on “Sleep Like a Baby Tonight”—are jarring enough to expose just how overblown his crooning is on <i>Songs of Innocence</i>. While the album’s liner notes contain a moving, train-of-thought reflection on a childhood made up of witnessing car bombings and sneaking into Ramones shows, almost none of that insight makes it into the actual songs, which are a celebration of self-absorption: </span><span>“You are rock and roll” quickly amended to “You and I are rock and roll.”</span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-7919736f-6614-2e28-781b-0bc5f63a22a7"">Perhaps the upcoming companion album, inevitably named <i>Songs of Experience</i>, will contain all the darker, cynical stuff from these sessions. Regardless, U2 have already squandered any remaining integrity to invent this needy, invasive breed of the Big Event Album, an Album that lacks any kind of artistic statement to deter from the overwhelming Brandiness. Where Beyoncé used <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18821-beyonce-beyonce"">her iTunes sneak attack</a> late last year to make a bold pop proclamation of sexuality and feminism, U2 have used an even more audacious release platform to wave their arms and simply say, “Hey! Everybody! We’re still here!” Bono may have self-deprecatingly described <i>Songs of Innocence</i> as “the blood, sweat and tears of some Irish guys...in your junk mail,” but it’s not even that interesting—it’s just a blank message.</span></p></div>"|19816.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19816-u2-songs-of-innocence/|4.6|Rob Mitchum

After splintering from rock quartet Simian in 2005, Ford and Shaw turned toward the type of high-energy, melodically palatable electro that came to be known for a mercifully brief spell as “blog-house,” releasing one of the genre’s most colorful and striking full-lengths in the form of the 2007 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10345-attack-decay-sustain-release/""><i>Attack Decay Sustain Release</i></a>.</p>
<p>The title of SMD’s 2009 follow-up, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13420-temporary-pleasure/""><i>Temporary Pleasure</i></a>, suggested the London duo’s dance-pop might be getting stale, so the following year saw them take a successful left turn into hard techno territory, launching the Delicatessen label and releasing an enjoyable batch of roilers in the form of that year’s singles collection <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14896-delicacies/""><i>Delicacies</i></a>. At this point, SMD aren’t exactly underrated—their 2012 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16654-unpatterns/""><i>Unpatterns</i></a> was a just-okay collision of their techno and electro tendencies—but their longevity has perhaps gone underappreciated, as recent collaborations with techno heavy-hitters like Irish duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31211-bicep/"">Bicep</a> and German veteran <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10842-roman-flugel/"">Roman Flügel</a> have spoken to the duo’s adventurousness and steady sense of industry.</p>
<p>SMD's new album <i>Whorl</i> plays like an expected follow-up to the pleasantly forgettable <i>Unpatterns</i> rather than a confirmation of SMD’s still-revered live show. Much of the 64-minute set emphasizes texture over dynamics, content to exist as background music. This, in and of itself, is not the worst thing that could happen: Ford and Shaw are experts at the nuts and bolts of sound—the former is also an in-demand studio producer and songwriter—so the drifting ambience and analog burbles of <i>Whorl</i> are, like ice sculptures, glimmering in their plainness. The swirling, beatless one-two kiss of “Redshift” and “Dandelion Spheres” take on pleasing, meditative shapes, but the downtempo fare presented elsewhere—the frizzy, disjointed atmospherics of “Z Space”, “Nazard”’s questionable flirtations with chillout—simply dissipates upon contact.</p>
<p>As ever, SMD are most engaging when creating body-moving, uptempo fare: “Calyx” percolates and whines to a pleasing climax, with piping tones dancing on its surface, while “Tangents” builds to an anthemic swirl of synth lines anchored by a steady, hissing 4/4. Most notably, “Jam Side Up” rides a cascading melody for nearly six minutes, building and breaking a beat around it with a sense of patience that makes for an impressive mid-tune peak. These three tracks are clustered in the middle section of <i>Whorl</i>, possibly to mimic the structural build of a live performance, but the shiftless sounds that come before are more likely to trigger a click on ""pause"" rather than create anticipation for what’s to follow.</p>
<p>Just last year, SMD released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17877-simian-mobile-disco-live/""><i>Live</i></a>, an untouchable document of their onstage capabilities that stands as their most pleasurable recorded statement. On <i>Live</i> they distilled their two primary modes—their harder, abstract side and their more explicitly pop-leaning past—into something cohesive and enjoyable, but the set also highlighted the duo’s Achilles heel: they’re more of a singles outfit (as many dance acts are) and when they’re constrained to the album format, tedium creeps in. That’s been the case since <i>Temporary Pleasure</i>, and it’s the case for <i>Whorl</i>, too, a record that finds SMD operating at half-speed when the accelerator is pedal is close within their reach.</p></div>"|19656.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19656-simian-mobile-disco-whorl/|6.5|Larry FItzmaurice

Much of the conversation about Aiko posited her as a musical foil for her more widely known rapper friends. Her debut mixtape <i>Sailing Soul(s)</i> flourished by co-opting the minor key melodies and navel gazing oversharing of R&amp;B radio’s wistful sad boys, but her delivery hewed a touch too vacant, her words too indistinct, to carry an entire project. Last year’s “The Worst” was a Technicolor reveal, a performance involved and emotional enough to shake frequent comparisons to cult pop-R&amp;B stoic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10905-cassie"">Cassie</a> and break Aiko on a national level without a celebrity co-star leading the way. Even if the accompanying <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18777-jhene-aiko-sail-out-ep/""><i>Sail Out </i></a>EP was still a rap friends roll call, “The Worst” proved she could go it alone if need be, rapping and all.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Sovereignty seems to be the mission of Aiko’s proper debut <i>Souled Out</i>. Throughout the album, the predominant voice heard is hers; barring some choice backing vocals from songwriter to the stars James Fauntleroy, the lone celebrity guest spot is a bottom of the ninth appearance from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/806-common/"">Common</a> on the album closer “Pretty Bird (Freestyle)”. It’s a high-risk measure, a glut of solo mood pieces from an artist many may only have experienced a few lines at a time on friends’ choruses. But anchoring <i>Souled Out </i>are Aiko’s advancing command of her instrument and a more daring approach to melody. These songs ask more of her than the mopey, low-register <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a>-fan-service of her earlier material. Her voice skips and flits across these compositions with a confidence that defies the limits of her range. Aiko has zeroed in on her strengths as a performer (stoned perseverance, stoned exhaustion) and tailored <i>Souled Out </i>specifically around them. The breathy resignation of “It’s Cool” fits the song’s pursuit of a distant love interest hand in glove, while “Wading”, awash in unrequited romance, emotes with desolate, echoing vocal runs.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Aiko’s writing can be a liability, though. In avoiding the Ester Deans, Ryan Tedders, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4058-sia/"">Sia</a>s that workshop many of her peers’ hits behind the scenes, she gives <i>Souled Out </i>a distinctly personal edge and an earnest, lived-in feel. It also means there's sporadic lapses into pat aphorisms that do few favors for the record's ""melody first, lyrics later"" songwriting approach. Opener “Limbo Limbo Limbo” gets overwrought quick: “She was just as basic as the universal language of love.” “W.A.Y.S.” folds Buddhist monk spirituality into Cheshire Cat turns of phrase: “You have got to lose your mind just to find your peace of mind.” “There’s really no fail, there’s really no winning/ 'Cause nothing really is, and everything really isn’t.” “Lyin King” dabbles in pop psychology: “Mr. Serial Lover, I wish your mother loved you like I could’ve.” Like <i>Sail Out</i>’s<i> </i>bonus track “Comfort Inn Ending (Freestyle)”, <i>Souled Out</i>’s nightcap “Pretty Bird (Freestyle)” finds Aiko vocalizing free verse for one of the album’s most impassioned performances. But the thematic conceit—Aiko having run out of things to say—doesn’t need four minutes of exploratory scatting to bear out.</p>
<p class=""p1"">With Aiko’s writing flowing freely from relatable distress to hotbox reverie, <i>Souled Out</i>’s producers, composers, and players are tasked with minding the turbulence. <i>Sailing Soul(s)</i> and <i>Sail Out</i> architect Fisticuffs sneaks a few cuts in, buoyed by a handful of contributions from No I.D., <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3611-royksopp"">Röyksopp</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8562-kid-cudi/"">Kid Cudi</a> mainstay Dot Da Genius, and others. Though <i>Souled Out</i>’s cast is diverse, its sound is of a piece; end to end, it surges with a lush, aquatic gravitas, distinctly R&amp;B but never confined to genre conventions. “W.A.Y.S.” pairs contributions from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"">Thundercat</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"">Clams Casino</a>, bombing gently plucked guitars with massive, echoing drums and cross-breeding both artists’ trademark sounds to dramatic effect. “Spotless Mind” imagines a world where a post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7099-the-police/"">Police</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7100-sting"">Sting</a> discovered drum machines instead of turtles and lutes, before spinning out on a loping guitar coda reminiscent of “Strawberry Letter 23”, while the plinking bells and wraith-like synths of “Wading” might’ve graced a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a> record in another era. <i>Souled Out</i>’s production is a warm bath of understated musicality, even if it’s occasionally a bit too drippy and sleepy for its own good.</p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Souled Out</i> capably buffs Jhené Aiko’s strengths and shellacks her faults, but the moments where she steps out into the depth of her story transcend the synergy of a group of musicians with good chemistry. On “Promises”, Aiko speaks to her daughter, whose quality time with her mom is hindered by the exacting commitments of celebrity, and to her deceased older brother, whom she petitions for strength in trying times. The heartrending vulnerability of the trek through Aiko's fears into a knowing acceptance of the fragility of life, the randomness of misfortune, and her eagerness to keep at it in the wake of an irreparable loss, is quietly devastating. “W.A.Y.S.” (short for “Why aren’t you smiling?”, one of her brother’s final Twitter transmissions) is a mantralike message of hope charged with as much determination as self-suggestion, a perseverance she has had to speak into existence. Hers has been an arduous road, but with <i>Souled Out</i>, Jhené Aiko has begun to knead adversity into sustenance.</p></div>"|19791.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19791-jhene-aiko-souled-out/|6.5|Craig Jenkins

There’s a vibrant music scene there, of course, but it’s a direct outgrowth of a climate—economic, political, and cultural as well as meteorological—that can be suffocating. This is the land that nursed Deicide and<i><b> </b></i>Assück, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32174-floor/"">Floor</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5361-against-me/"">Against Me!</a>, Neon Blud and Cult Ritual. More recently, it also birthed the Ukiah Drag. Featuring members of, among other outfits, the aforementioned Neon Blud and Cult Ritual, the band hails from the Tampa and Gainesville areas, two of the state’s most fertile musical hotbeds. They’ve played alongside members of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30479-merchandise/"">Merchandise</a>, who took them on tour this past June. But the best thing about the Ukiah Drag’s debut album, <i>In The Reaper’s Quarters</i>, isn’t how much it embodies some hypothetical spirit or ethic of Florida; it’s how much the record, like Merchandise’s new <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19663-merchandise-after-the-end/"">After the End</a></i>, strives to be somewhere else entirely.</p>
<p><i>In The Reaper’s Quarters</i> was presaged by last year's four-song cassette <i>Jazz Mama Is Cryin</i>, which staked an immediate claim on entirely alien territory: some imagined badland where the Gun Club’s death-blues, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22521-the-birthday-party/"">the Birthday Party</a>’s cock-goth, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31063-destruction-unit/"">Destruction Unit</a>’s sandblasted drones overlap. Frontman ZZ Ramiriez, though, comes from an even stranger domain. On “The Rat's Waltz”, which appeared in a more lo-fi version on <i>Jazz Mama</i>, he surfs curdled waves of distortion so dark they can’t be seen through; beneath him a wah pedal squeals queasily like a lizard being gently stepped on. But instead of howling like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/710-nick-cave/"">Nick Cave</a> and his ilk, he sneers with creepy, adenoidal geekiness— Stan Ridgway hosting a Halloween party as the Crypt Keeper, cranking his Mexican radio until the air turns to goo.</p>
<p>The Ukiah Drag’s list of influences stray a bit too far afield on “Wait and See”, a cover of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18825-theres-a-dream-ive-been-saving-lee-hazlewood-industries-19661971/"">Lee Hazlewood</a> song that doesn’t do enough to distinguish itself from the admittedly gorgeous original; the barrel-chested vocals wind up resembling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2200-calvin-johnson/"">Calvin Johnson</a>, and not in a good way. There’s a jarring, melancholy sincerity to the song that doesn’t sit well with the Ukiah Drag’s swamp-ass psychedelia, although it’s salvaged somewhat by a lazily monstrous guitar solo. Taken together, “Final Prayer” and “Drip from the Fang” offer the most concentrated burst of rancid bog-juice that <i>In The Reaper’s Quarter </i>keeps on tap. Situated back-to-back, the two songs span the band’s gleefully constricted scope: “Drip from the Fang” coils and springs like rusted clockwork, a snake with its head cut off and unable to tell that it’s no longer alive. That twitchy, zombie-like vibe subsides to a simmer on “Final Prayer”. Stitched together out of poltergeist moans, dry-ice fog, and twangy licks that crawl about with their bellies in the dust, the track lurches and lumbers as Ramiriez sets his bleary sights on the mirage-haunted horizon: “Next to you/ In your kingdom/ That’s where I want to live/ Take me there.”</p>
<p>The Ukiah Drag no longer reside in Florida, and perhaps that’s telling; many of the great bands in the state’s history got the hell out of there as soon as they could, too. The group is now in self-imposed “New England exile,” and <i>In The Reaper’s Quarters </i>was recorded in New York, “off the banks of the Hudson River,” according to them, produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29754-the-men/"">the Men</a>'s Ben Greenberg. Still, the album evokes the essential <i>otherness</i> of Florida, if not the stifling essence of Florida itself, and that’s for the best. Plagued by affluent retirees, voter suppression, and sinkholes, for fuck’s sake, Florida is—amid all its lushness—a place of death and decay, the reaper’s quarters, indeed. “Diggin’ down deep!” Ramiriez yelps on the lopsided, organ-soaked “Her Royal Grip”, knowing full well that Florida, barely above sea level, isn’t a place where you can dig very deep at all. Then he adds, his voice like thickening quicksand, “You ain’t goin’ nowhere/ ’Cause there’s nowhere to go.” In The Ukiah Drag’s eyes, geography is neither a trap nor a means of escape. It’s a shallow grave to play in.</p></div>"|19670.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19670-the-ukiah-drag-in-the-reapers-quarters/|7.2|Jason Heller

He’s been making and refining his own antagonistic strain since the mid-1990s, leading Krieg through some of the most important, compelling and twisted stateside versions of the form. He’s run a label and become a crucial distribution point for many acts, welcomed outsiders into the dark fold, publicly defended the acquisition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3874-thurston-moore/"">Thurston Moore</a> by his supergroup <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32153-twilight/"">Twilight</a>, and <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/neill-krieg-blake-judd"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">dismissed insider and old friend Blake Judd</a> as an expression of the genre at its solipsistic worst. He’s advocated for progression in the form by endorsing the firebrands of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/8761-death-to-black-metal/"">Liturgy</a> while maintaining that the genre must stay tough and unruly unless it wants to become as <a href=""http://www.nocleansinging.com/2014/03/04/an-ncs-interview-neill-jameson-imperial-of-twilight-krieg/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">weak as water</a>. “I have boots that are older than most of these people’s interest in black metal,” <a href=""http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/templateid/15756/menuid/3/tempidx/5/catid/4/restemp/N%3B/fPpagesel/1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he once said</a>, swiftly encapsulating his admixture of old-school aggression and excitable acceptance. “I figure black metal is probably just a curiosity for the white-belt crowd.… I’m not as bothered by it as some people are; it’s just the evolution of things.”</p>
<p><i>Transient </i>is<i> </i>Krieg’s first album in four years, second since a necessary hiatus, and first featuring Jameson surrounded by a new quartet. Moreover, it’s an hour-long expression of Jameson’s defensive and defiant attitude, as it sprawls from a base of recalcitrant black metal in intriguing, unexpected directions. A uniformly desolate album, <i>Transient </i>is a claustrophobic listen that provides the illusion of walls closing in and ceilings coming down, even as its sound opens wider. Though the core of Krieg and these 11 songs remains primitive black metal, epitomized by mid-album melee “Atlas with a Broken Arm”, the album serves as a reminder that Jameson has never been one for stasis. He’s shifted Krieg’s lineup between most albums, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_4J8xgA-EU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covered</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">the Velvet Underground</a> in a croaking acoustic guise, and massaged a broad spectrum of influences into this band. <i>Transient </i>leans hard into those outlier aims: Some moments shimmer with the pop-metal buoyancy that temporarily worked as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5803-nachtmystium/"">Nachtmystium</a>’s calling card, while others burrow into slow, strong doom wallops. There are orchestrated power electronics interludes and hardcore stomp-alongs, solemn spoken-word passages and taut post-punk counter-riffs. Jameson’s boots are ostensibly meant for hiking.</p>
<p>But credit goes to Jameson’s irascible voice—here, the best it’s ever been—for threading together these disparate musical thoughts and giving the record its overriding sense of desperation. No matter the particular song’s style or structure, he plays the part of the reprobate. He bellows like a bully during the hardcore half of “Return Fire” and screams in agony when it downshifts in the back, a madman melting in his own sweat. Krieg recorded <i>Transient</i> at the Rhode Island studio Machines with Magnets, a room perhaps <a href=""http://machineswithmagnets.com/tag/the-body/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">best known for its work with The Body.</a> You can hear that duo’s echoes during the brilliant cover of Amebix’s “Winter”, which pivots from brief black metal builds into bottomless doom tirades. Above a rhythm section that suggests orchestrated artillery fire, Jameson lashes out as though he’s being interred by the force of his own band. In fact, he delivers much of <i>Transient</i> as though he’s singing <i>beneath</i> the outfit, fighting to be heard among the din of guitars and drums. That choice makes <i>Transient</i> both<i> </i>bleak and beguiling; Jameson sounds trapped, but you want to lean in close, dangerously so, to hear what he has to yell. Even during “Walk With Them Unnoticed,” that particularly upbeat and racing number, his hoarse tone comes tucked just beneath the lip of the lead, making even the album’s most breathless and accessible bit feel hazardous.</p>
<p>Though Jameson emerged as a one-man black metal band, first under the name Imperial and later as Krieg, he’s a rich collaborator, too. His roster of past alliances and collaborations is the length of a few paragraphs, and he’s one of only two people to appear on every Twilight album. He’s made doom with March into the Sea and tortured prismatic weirdness with N.I.L., and his willingness to work with others is a crucial component of <i>Transient</i>, a record that benefits from pulling Jameson out of his own head. Opener “Order of the Solitary Road” starts slow, turns into a sprint, manages to pick up the pace yet again and ultimately staggers off into the distance; it’s a full-band feat, motivated by the drums but pulled along by Alex Poole’s spectacularly assorted riffs. In the span of six minutes, he lands a perfectly slow, steely melody at the start and, near the middle, a grim, low-lying theme.</p>
<p>And then there’s “Home”, a long spoken-word cold stare and the sort of oddity that provides a welcome stopgap before the record’s charged finale. Over eerie, failed-transmission electronics, Integrity’s Dwid Hellion and Thurston Moore trade stanzas about absence and loneliness. “The only home I know anymore is that of discomfort,” Moore reads, “a feeling of displacement which resides inside of me wherever I go.” The plainspoken text reinforces the album’s depressive atmosphere, which can be intuited but, thanks to Jameson’s delivery, never quite confirmed or dissected. It gives more breadth to those feelings, providing what started as solitary laments from a one-man band the benefit of misery in good company.</p></div>"|19680.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19680-krieg-transient/|8.0|Grayson Haver Currin

That lack of intimate connection and tactile resolution is echoed in the failed interface hinted at in the album’s title. DFA 1979 just couldn’t get no satisfaction—and when the band blew up in the mid '00s, they promptly imploded, only adding to that nagging tingle. Here was a duo gathering the shrapnel of so many scenes that exploded earlier in the decade—garage rock, stoner metal, dance punk—squeezing them into a tightly wound mass of fuzz and force, only to let it all slip through their fingers. </p>
<p>DFA 1979’s two halves, vocalist/drummer Sebastien Grainger and bassist/keyboardist Jesse F. Keeler, parted ways in 2006. Grainger kept sporadically busy as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12406-sebastien-grainger-and-the-mountains"">singer</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18750-sebastien-grainger-yours-to-discover/"">/</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12406-sebastien-grainger-and-the-mountains""></a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18750-sebastien-grainger-yours-to-discover/"">songwriter</a>; Keeler moved his electro-slanted side-project <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4856-mstrkrft/"">MSTRKRFT</a> to the front burner. Now, after an initial onstage reunion in 2011 that marked the mending of broken fences, they’ve delivered <i>The Physical World</i>. So much has changed since <i>You’re a Woman</i>, and so little, too: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56622-julian-casablancas-the-voidz-release-where-no-eagles-fly-video-awesome-single-artwork/"">Julian Casablancas</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19794-karen-o-crush-songs/"">Karen O</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19693-interpol-el-pintor/"">Interpol</a> are still around, and coincidentally, each of them has even made noise this very week. (It’s enough to make you wonder if they all secretly synced up with each other to enhance their retro-'00s brand synergy.) But it’s been a decade since Grainger and Keeler showed up to that particular party with 12-packs in hand, and they were a little late, arriving just as it was beginning to simmer down. Granted, they helped send it off with a bang; a last spurt of debauchery before everyone either hooks up or passes out, <i>You’re a Woman </i>raged like there was no tomorrow.</p>
<p><i>The Physical World</i>—wiser and more wary than its predecessor—<i>is </i>that tomorrow, the one that was never supposed to come.  It doesn't so much sound like <i>You’re a Woman </i>was 10 years ago as it does 10 months: “It’s the same old song, just a different tune,” Grainger rasps on “Right On, Frankenstein!”, an efficient yet spirited dance-punk procedural that wouldn’t have sounded out of place amid <i>You’re a Woman</i> rockers like “Turn It Out” and “Cold War”. <i>The Physical World </i>is built out of pieces of the band’s own past, but it hangs together beautifully, all sleek musculature and acrobatic riffs. There’s not as much scraping, lunging, or dive-bombing on the album as compared to <i>You’re a Woman</i>, although that doesn’t keep <i>The Physical World</i>’s title track from glitching and spazzing in a fugue of pseudo-metallic collapse: “Go bridge won/ Has strung out/ Build up/ Tear it down,” Grainger wails, resembling a cyborg caught in a robotic purgatory. “Oh no, not again/ I get the feeling this is never gonna end.” The song dissolves in a haze of wheezing keyboard, like some creaking, rickety, steampunk version of itself.</p>
<p>Solipsism and self-recycling aside, Grainger branches out into new territory, at least for DFA 1979: a conceptual arc, if not a narratively coherent one. ""Virgins"" and ""White Is Red"" hinge together like a great, two-part TV episode, full of lurid melodrama and teen-angst iconography; summer school, skating in pools, and innocence left in the backseat of a car all pop up in ""Virgins"", which pounds and writhes with Ted Nugent-meets-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7676-josh-homme/"">Josh Homme</a> swagger. And while the similarly highway-themed ""White Is Red"" seems like a sequel of sorts—""Frankie was a heartbreaker, I didn’t know it at the start/ She was only 16 when she went and broke my heart,"" Grainger croons with all the grit of a natural-born balladeer, or at least <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9484-sams-town/"">Brandon Flowers</a> with a better grasp of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"">the Boss</a>— it doesn’t overtax the link. These are loose associations, motifs that float around and occasionally complete each other, the type of subtlety that the Grainger of <i>You’re a Woman</i> wasn’t concerned with. Balling and brooding were his two settings, and he toggled them frantically, never seeming to find what he was looking for, so he's clearly spent the last 10 years doing some growing up.</p>
<p>In a <a href=""http://www.stereogum.com/1703320/qa-death-from-above-1979-on-the-physical-world-and-being-a-cautionary-tale-for-young-bands/franchises/interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent interview</a> Keeler did for Stereogum, he talks about his and Grainger's metamorphosis from hormone-pumping post-adolescents to grownups with families and, of all the crazy things, <i>lives</i>. “Back then we didn’t have any kind of life outside of the band,” he says, speaking of the DFA 1979's pre-breakup years. “The band was everything; it was literally all we had. Now we both have lives of our own outside of the music we make together. And that’s really important. Everyone needs to have a life.” Calling <i>The Physical World </i>a work of maturity would be selling the album, and maturity, short: “Cheap Talk” and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56336-death-from-above-1979-debut-new-song-government-trash/"">“Government Trash”</a> zoom like rockets and stomp like dinosaurs, full of snotty, boyish abandon, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55811-death-from-above-1979-share-trainwreck-1979/"">“Trainwreck 1979”</a> dabbles in mirror-gazing and mythologizing. The album is, above all, pragmatic—a more judicious application of the band’s mixed-use energy—but it doesn’t do so at the expense of soul.</p>
<p><i>The Physical World</i>’s most gripping song, “Always On”, paints a dystopian scenario drawn from DFA 1979’s own experience as the objects of expectation as well as the downward spiral of music-industry boom-and-bust. Grainger sneers, “If we brought Kurt back to life/ There’s no way he would survive,” and he’s not only talking about the vicissitudes of the pop world that Kurt Cobain loved and hated, but also of the social-media membrane we’ve all become cocooned in. “Show me something new/ Something I can like,” he begs in singsong horror as he hops across a bed of sharpened hooks, unable to reconcile, consummate, or otherwise bridge the schism between what exists online and what can only be touched by skin. With <i>The Physical World</i>, Grainger and Keeler haven’t entirely scratched the itch they instigated a decade ago. But they’ve learned to live with the burn, and that’s the next best thing.</p></div>"|19801.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19801-death-from-above-1979-the-physical-world/|7.0|Jason Heller

Patrick Riley and Alaina Moore emerged as the summer of 2010 started to take on heat, armed with a handful of breezy, weightless singles and a story that seemed salvaged from a rousing game of Indie-Pop Mad Libs: a young couple (insert relationship) from Denver (city) bought a sailboat (unconventional vehicle) and recorded an album about a journey on said vehicle, working under the name Tennis (sport). That album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15020-cape-dory/""><i>Cape Dory</i></a>, was released in January 2011, and could’ve been knocked over by a stiff sea breeze: the melodies within were pleasant but thin, and the cute story that lay at the album’s core wasn’t enough to render the music it inspired particularly compelling. The band has had a hard time escaping that plot point in the years since <i>Cape Dory</i> was released; it’s hard to find an interview or piece of coverage that opens with something other than a mention of Tennis’ stint on the waters of the Eastern Seaboard. </p>
<div>
<div>It’s too bad, because the band has largely moved on from the sound and sensibility of their early career; in fact, much of their work since has felt like a reaction to the story that lit a spark under them in the first place. They added a drummer, James Barone, and embraced bittersweet, autumnal melodies that paired well with lyrical darkness and a touch of fuzz. Subsequent releases like 2012’s second full-length <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16252-young-and-old/""><i>Young and Old</i></a> and 2013’s fine <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18713-tennis-small-sound-ep/""><i>Small Sound</i></a> EP were brought to life with help from well-known producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/375-the-black-keys"">the Black Keys</a>’ drummer Patrick Carney and indie rock vet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4137-richard-swift/"">Richard Swift</a>, and their best moments (“Origins”, “Mean Streets”) hinted at a level of craftsmanship and depth their early material sorely lacked. Their new record, <i>Ritual in Repeat</i>, finds Tennis continuing to mature and highlight their strengths—Moore’s growing voice, an ear for melody—with the help of yet another prominent producer, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3916-spoon/"">Spoon</a>’s Jim Eno.</div>
<div></div>
<div><i>Ritual in Repeat</i> is a nicely confident album, one that takes a simple formula—play Moore’s sweet, thin voice against sour, brooding arrangements, and eventually break open into sticky, yearning choruses laden with harmony—to a few unexpected places. The influence of the complex, emotionally ambiguous pop music of the late ‘60s and ‘70s (a period that casts a shadow over much of the band’s work) is still present, but there’s also tendrils of slinky funk (“I’m Callin’”), contemporary dream-pop (“Viv Without the N”), and spectral thesaurus-folk (“Wounded Heart”) snaking their way through the album. Almost every song has a muscle and weight to its arrangement that complements Moore’s vocal work. She’ll never have the power or gravitas of some of her contemporaries, but she’s gotten much better at writing material that suits her skill set, namely agility and an ease with harmony.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The agility comes in handy, because <i>Ritual in Repeat</i> occasionally sounds a little too cluttered and dense for its own good. The band and producers pile fragments of melody and instrumentation on top of each other, and it can become tough to pick out the most rewarding musical thread. It’s a record that could benefit from the application of what could be termed the Chanel principle, an adaptation of the designer’s famous quote about getting dressed: before you leave the studio, look in the mirror and take one thing out of your song. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Tennis has matured on the lyrical front in recent years, too: <i>Ritual in Repeat </i>focuses on complicated relationships and self-examination, rather than the vagaries of travel or the various meteorological events that marked the band's early work. The album's characters are always looking for validation, whether from a partner or some higher power; they look to their lovers, in the mirror, and to the heavens for some sort of sign that they're doing things right and moving forward. Sighing opener ""Night Vision"" finds Moore ably setting the scene for the latter kind of search—you can see her sitting on a wooded porch, staring in vain into the middle distance, thinking about mistakes she's made and people she's left behind. Her voice hangs with the quiet, private dissatisfaction of people who seem to have everything they could ever want, and it imbues the band's songs with a nuanced, compelling sadness. This very specific feeling is only occasionally obfuscated by her diction, which is showy to a fault; songs like ""Needle and a Knife"" and ""Wounded Heart"" are literate to the point of distraction, stuffed with ten dollar words where they could be simple and sharp. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Tennis are clearly capable of that level of acute writing, because they use it to succinctly sum up their band's appeal on back-half highlight ""This Isn't My Song"": ""Only simple melodies/ Find their way into your memory...It's nothing profound/ Just a sweet sound."" It's a smart reading of their strengths, and even a little cheeky when taken alongside <i>Ritual in Repeat</i>'s cover and larger subject matter: if you're inclined to Tennis negatively, they look like a group of blank people offering bland sweetness devoid of deeper meaning. While the band might've fit that description at one point, they've since grown past it, so if you're one of the listeners who dismissed their earlier work<i> </i>as banal and bourgeois, know that Tennis has since earned another chance.</div>

What’s interesting is how everyone involved seems to have a tacit understanding of what “the 1980s” means and how it narrows an entire decade into a few signifiers—this band doesn’t represent the 1980s and its attendant political discord or technological advances, nor does it ever account for the incredible leaps in punk, metal, hip-hop, electronic, you name it. It doesn’t even include <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson"">Michael Jackson</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3397-prince"">Prince</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen"">Bruce Springsteen</a>.</p>
<p>Rather, “the 1980s” establishes a few movies and their soundtracks as the entire cultural zeitgeist, with inexcusably old-looking “teens” and their irrepressible hormones set to perky, up-tempo rhythms and an emotional tenor where the “Me Decade” filters down from Wall Street to high schoolers obsessed with true love and self-actualization. This style of music might be more prominent now than it is was 30 years ago and multinational trio Ballet School seem to be aware of that; their name could pass for a <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102940/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dean Cameron-starring caper flick</a>, the title of their debut might be too precious for even an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83"">M83</a> instrumental, and its lead singer has a chameleonic voice that ""Saturday Night Live"" could've used during the Nora Dunn era. Their first single was called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15715-ballet-school-heartbeat-overdrive"">“Heartbeat Overdrive”</a> and the title alone probably makes any analysis of this record redundant.</p>
<p>Point being, <i>The Dew Lasts an Hour</i> ain’t an album, it’s an arms race, and Ballet School are at their best when they’re pushing the nuclear option. After a two-minute ambient intro that exists mostly as a reminder that Ballet School are an indie band on a label operated by<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins""> Cocteau Twins</a>' Simon Raymonde, “Pale Saint” and “Ghost” put all the signifiers at full-blast—guitars and keyboards are glazed and glistening under the same effects, pealing, swirling, and billowing to corroborate a narrator that never gets their head out of the clouds. Real drums are processed to sound like synths, and vice versa. They cut footloose at a manic pace, bright pink leggings endlessly pumping on a StairMaster. And Ballet School compensate for a lack of originality with enthusiasm—Rosie Blair’s melodies may not be all that memorable, but she sure sings the hell out of them.</p>
<p>If their predilection for the sounds of “the 1980s” has a particularly modern slant, it’s that Ballet School operate under the premise that populism is inherently good<span>—</span>Blair gives <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/617-kate-bush"">Kate Bush</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10697-mariah-carey"">Mariah Carey</a> equal stature, which leads to some unfortunate ululation and vocal cloudbusting that undermine the reverie. <i>The Dew Lasts an Hour</i> is more effective as ambience than pure pop; there’s a dissonance between Blair’s skyscraping and the modest production, which actually situates the record in 2010 more than it does 1984. That was a particularly productive year for mid-fi indie bands who immersed themselves in reverb and blurred the line between 4AD and MTV, including the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14675-forget"">Twin Shadow</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14280-gemini"">Wild Nothing albums</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5789-abe-vigoda/"">Abe Vigoda</a>’s overlooked goth-pop about-face <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14647-crush""><i>Crush</i></a>.</p>
<p>But with the aforementioned, you could sense that the sound was secondary, a preferred filter to express either deep-seated trauma, window-watching loneliness, or slow-burning intensity.

You’re supposed to feel it rather than analyze it. But after its auspicious start, <i>The Dew Last an Hour</i> tries to convey similar sentiments amid agreeable, midtempo synth-pop that skimps on the pop and piles on the twinkling, harmonized guitars and vaporous melodies. What begins as a cooling blast of fresh air dissipates into pleasant ambience.</p>
<p>As the story goes, Blair met guitarist Michel Jun Collett as a busker in Berlin and bonded over a shared appreciation of Cocteau Twins. The facts check out: throughout, they show an eagerness to please, their originals could pass for covers and they obviously and really, really like the Cocteau Twins. But that’s about it.  For now, <i>The Dew Lasts an Hour</i> is a proxy for “what we talk about when we talk about ‘the 1980s,'"" not so much for talking about Ballet School themselves.</p></div>"|19720.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19720-ballet-school-the-dew-lasts-an-hour/|6.2|Ian Cohen

It began with a literal tearing apart of his influences, and then set off on a journey to see how much further away he could progressively move from them. His first full-length release, <i>Diversions 1994-1996</i>, tore passages from jungle mixtapes, stripped all the beats out, and reimagined them as dysfunctional bad dreams. The word “abstract” is never far away when people reach for descriptions of the London-based producer—and with good reason. His second release for <a href=""http://p-a-n.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pan</a>, <i>Dutch Tvashar Plumes</i>, was a hollowed out shell of techno, where all semblance of form and shape was lost long ago, leaving only fragments of a former good time. Gamble’s music is staged in an unusual place, somewhere between the unreal and the all-too-real, where wretched drug experiences at past-peak club hours somehow end up in a form of metaphysical drift into the following morning.</p>
<p><i>KOCH</i> is a sprawling record, containing 16 tracks spread out over more than an hour. It takes time and patience to figure out what Gamble is going through, and even then, there are no easy answers. It’s a work of complexity, although its parts, when isolated, don’t necessarily form knotty riddles. “Motor System” quietly pounds out a rudimentary beat while flattened voices curl around it, suggesting a highly mechanized form of industrial music. Often there are layers of distortion coating everything, such as on “Caudata”, where Gamble constructs graceful shapes over a wall of fog, putting it in a similar place to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28582-leyland-kirby"">Leyland Kirby</a>’s work with old 78 rpm records on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15518-an-empty-bliss-beyond-this-world/""><i>An Empty Bliss Beyond This World</i></a>. Another technique he’s fond of is spinning out the club experience in slow motion, or making it feel like it’s happening in a place that’s far away but just close enough so the tiniest welt of bass can still be heard (“You Concrete"").</p>
<p>The overriding feel on <i>KOCH</i> is one of removal, of distant observation. Gamble’s music has the feel of someone floating above it, looking in, only tangentially participating in what’s going on. Beats are muffled, signals echo for an eternity; on “Head Model”, there’s acres of room between the parts being triggered, but it never feels like there’s a ton of space opening up. Instead, it’s all dense, claustrophobic reflection, with many of Gamble’s tracks trapped in one very specific moment without any forward flow at all. Occasionally there’s movement, but even that verges on the cyclical. “HMix” begins with a charge of muddied beats and bass, only to get filtered into reedy compression that resembles the worst kind of amphetamine headrush. There’s a similar mindset here to others who have attempted to scoop out the innards of electronics to see what remains—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28985-actress/"">Actress</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"">Autechre</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3240-pan-sonic/"">Pan Sonic</a>—but Gamble is in an even more detached place, where the inclusionary side of club culture appears utterly alien.</p>
<p>An emergent motif on <i>KOCH</i> is the awkwardness Gamble siphons into his work, where parts only just fit or threaten to fall out of sequence altogether. “Ornith-Mimik” is all glistening, high-pitched tones sloppily vying with a straight pulse and random video game interference, while “Gillsman” is so purposefully clumsy it gains a drunken lop to its stride. It fits perfectly with the sense of separation this album is built on, as this is not music that has easily definable origins beyond Gamble’s headspace. It all revolves around small glances and split-second patterns, resembling the minutiae of club culture, taken and amplified into a bigger space where there’s barely any room left for it to breathe. At times, <i>KOCH</i> is so microscopic it feels like there’s barely any place left for this music to go. But Gamble keeps finding new ways to take it apart and reassemble it, to the point where something so closed off, so concerned with the smallest of gestures, feels thrillingly open.</p></div>"|19730.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19730-lee-gamble-koch/|7.2|Nick Neyland

The standard-bearers for riot grrrl's UK faction, Huggy Bear were noisemakers with a gleeful vengeance, courting chaos and ecstasy in buzzsaw punk anthems that made good on Emma Goldman's maxim about revolutionaries cutting rugs. The most overtly political thing about <i>Weaving</i>, on the other hand, is a dolefully Dickensian track title, ""In the Shadow of the Workhouse"", and the noisiest thing here—well, actually, there isn't one. Sonically, these stately, meditative ambient fantasias are a world away from Huggy Bear's manic flare-ups. If we're trotting out biographical bullet points, Johnson's membership in London experimental techno promoters Bleep43 has more bearing on the sound and shape of <i>Weaving</i>, which seems determined to reimagine New Age music as another form of techno—or, perhaps, vice versa.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But I get a kick out of the Huggy Bear factoid; it's like discovering that a talented kid you admired in high school has grown up and made good in a field completely different from the she was best known for—as though the varsity basketball forward were now a video-art savant, maybe, or the chess club champion had turned into a critically acclaimed chef. Because whatever Johnson's backstory, <i>Weaving</i> is a remarkably accomplished take on ambient music, and the fact that this is her debut album makes you wonder where Johnson has been hiding all this time.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Just five songs and 41 minutes long, <i>Weaving</i> is a modest affair, which works in its favor: short enough to get through in one sitting, compelling enough to want to loop indefinitely. It wears its influences on its sleeve: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30634-laurie-spiegel/"">Laurie Spiegel</a>'s chiming electronic tones and clean-lined arpeggios, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30237-suzanne-ciani/"">Suzanne Ciani</a>'s bright-eyed new age naïveté, the zen clarity of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/110-aphex-twin/"">Aphex Twin</a>'s <i>Selected Ambient Works Volume II</i> and, to a lesser extent, the pinwheeling proto-trance of Edgar Froese and Klaus Schulze. As such, Johnson finds common cause with contemporaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23550-donato-dozzy/"">Donato Dozzy</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30754-ricardo-donoso/"">Ricardo Donoso</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29955-steve-hauschildt/"">Steve Hauschildt</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29178-mark-mcguire/"">Mark McGuire</a>, but her work really couldn't be confused for any of theirs, either. </p>
<p class=""p1"">What most distinguishes Johnson's approach is her patience. Her repetitive sequences offer the most tantalizing kind of bait and switch: an arpeggio will tumble over and over and over again, to the point at which it feels less like a musical motif than a piece of the landscape or a law of nature. Only then does the bottom drop out, or a new note enters the mix, and the whole scene is flipped quietly on its ear. She often favors ringing open fifths and octaves, and plangent major sevenths forever on the verge of resolving, but she also knows how and when to introduce just enough dissonance to prevent the music sounding too pristine, too conflict-free; just consider the cricket-limbed white-noise pileup of the opening ""Ancestral Footsteps"" or the fat-fisted organ chords of ""Weaving"", stacking overtones upon overtones like a beam of white light shot through a prism. </p>
<p class=""p1"">There's nothing pro forma here. Every twist of the filter feels significant, and every new sound (or silence) seems quietly fraught with meaning. The title ""Words Came After Music"" apparently stems from a book arguing that music was a pre-linguistic system of communication, and <i>Weaving </i>makes good on the expressive capabilities of rhythm and repetition and pure, keening frequency.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">While the first four tracks are nominally beatless, the closing ""Silver Threads"" establishes a kind of footbridge between ambient music and techno. The first five minutes are all faint, dusted drone, luminous and diffuse as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/302-william-basinski/"">William Basinski</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17064-the-disintegration-loops/""><i>The </i><i>Disintegration Loops</i></a>; then, almost imperceptibly, broken kickdrum and hi-hat rhythms rise up out of the mist. Suddenly we're in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31301-sandwell-district/"">Sandwell District</a> territory, and you can sense Johnson beginning to feel her way toward an entire new world of ideas that may not have fit elsewhere on the album, with its soft edges and reverent air. Could Johnson also turn out to be a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28849-marcel-dettmann"">Dettmann</a>-like purveyor of steely dancefloor grit? Given how gracefully she's managed the leap between punk rock and electronic shamanism, I wouldn't rule anything out at this point.</p></div>"|19733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19733-jo-johnson-weaving/|7.7|Philip Sherburne

Featuring only acoustic guitar and hushed vocals, the song sounds like a nursery rhyme set to a wisp of a melody, building on obvious rhymes (city/pity) and worrying a single sentiment (she misses someone) until it’s threadbare. It’s not a song so much as it is the memory of one, something hummed while doing housework or waiting for the subway. <i>Crush Songs</i> is an album full of count-offs, flubbed notes, and background noises, each one signaling an unrehearsed quality to the music. Karen O sings and plays like she wants as little time as possible separating the idea for a song from its execution. Some even sound like she’s writing them as she sings them. </p>
<p>That these fourteen tracks sound like demos rather than fleshed-out tunes is the whole point. A crush is a fleeting emotion, a moment of intense affection rather than the drawn-out ups and downs of love or obsession. “When I was 27 I crushed <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">a lot</span>,” O writes in the liners, underlining for emphasis. “I wasn’t sure I’d ever fall in love again. These songs were written and recorded in private around this time.” It’s clear she wanted to get them down on tape before their respective crushes dissipated, and the album culls recordings made from 2006 through 2010. Mostly it’s just O strumming her guitar and singing softly, although occasionally she adds a drum loop, backing vocals, and what sounds like a harpsichord.</p>
<p>It’s an intentionally modest album, perhaps a reaction to the overstuffed <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17868-yeah-yeah-yeahs-mosquito/"">Mosquito</a></i> or to the <i>KO at </i><i>Home</i> demo leak. It certainly sounds like an extension of her soundtrack work for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/36304-listen-to-a-karen-o-wild-things-song/""><i>Where the Wild Things Are </i></a>and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/52078-listen-yeah-yeah-yeahs-karen-o-the-moon-song-from-spike-jonzes-film-her/"">Her</a></i>, but perhaps it’s too modest: these are all very short songs, with only three out of fourteen surpassing two minutes, and the whole thing runs a short twenty-six minutes, barely registering as a full album. That such brevity is thematically appropriate doesn’t make it any more musically satisfying. Most songs, including first single “Rapt” and even the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5036-the-doors/"">Doors</a> cover “Indian Summer”, fade out quickly before they’ve even established much in the way of melody or stakes. Only a few sound complete in this lo-fi state: A paean to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2237-michael-jackson/"">Michael Jackson</a>, “King” conveys a perfectly apt sense of childlike innocence through both its running time and its playful imagery: “Is he walking on the moon? I hope I don’t find out too soon.” The spoken-word part on closer “Sing Along” heralds some of the album’s most emphatic vocals on the album, yet just as it’s getting interesting, the song stumbles to an abrupt and unceremonious stop.</p>
<p>In its off-the-cuff aesthetic, <i>Crush Songs</i> isn’t too far removed from Karen O’s early work with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4704-yeah-yeah-yeahs/"">Yeah Yeah Yeahs</a>, except that the shrieks of “Art Star” and “Black Tongue” have been replaced by acoustic strums and falsetto notes. For the past decade or so, she has proved herself one of the most surprising and in-the-moment performers of the young century, through not only her vocals but her entire self-presentation: the smears of lipstick, the pre-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27895-lady-gaga/"">Gaga</a> outlandishness of her outfits, the unlikely balance of confrontation and communalism she projects from the stage. Even when seemingly every band out of New York was landing a record deal, Karen O lent her band a colorful volatility that their peers couldn’t be bothered to muster. While others played it painfully cool, she put herself as far out there as she could.</p>
<p>So it’s all the more disappointing that, despite the rawness of these recordings and the private nature of their creation, O sounds weirdly noncommittal on<i> Crush Songs</i>, as though the sparse demo arrangements were a form of holding back. It’s no coincidence that the album sounds best when there are several ideas and instruments in play at once, as with the drum loop and harpsichord on “Visits”. But how much better would “Body” sound with even a rudimentary band behind her? How easily might the Yeah Yeah Yeahs turn that half-hearted hook on “Rapt” into a show-closing punk anthem? In the end, very little is gained from the austerity of the presentation on <i>Crush Songs</i>, and we can only imagine what is lost. </p></div>"|19794.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19794-karen-o-crush-songs/|5.8|Stephen M.

He cannot hide this fact, whether or not you recognize his distinct vocal similarity to one of the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL7-CKirWZE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lesser bucket-hatted one-hit wonders</a>. Zahner-Isenberg was 19 when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28407-avi-buffalo/"">Avi Buffalo</a> released their auspicious and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14175-avi-buffalo"">""really, <i>really</i> horny"" debut</a>, and the four years leading up to <i>At Best Cuckold</i> have taken him well past drinking age. Every time it appears that Avi Buffalo’s music has matured to a point where it qualifies as college rock (or even dad rock), Zahner-Isenberg can’t keep his pubescent impulses at bay. During “Memories of You”, he sings, ""My bones are press/ Up to your chest"", at least according to what the lyrics sheet says, since it <i>clearly</i> sounds like he's singing, ""my boner pressed up to your chest.""</p>
<p>But <i>At Best Cuckold</i> isn't a confused or contradictory record, as the dissonance between Avi Buffalo’s progression and Zahner-Isenberg’s regressive lapses make it an intriguing and relatable document of internal struggle. And that struggle is more valuable than assurance, as Avi Buffalo’s brand of indie-rock might otherwise play it too straight. Whether they’re technically a Long Beach or Los Angeles band is a moot point<span>—</span>they’re West Coast indie, mostly cruising up and down the Pacific Coast Highway while edging towards the area’s outer extremities. Everything maintains a kind of regional flair, an ambition that’s cloaked by geniality; its atmosphere is dusky, twilight and ineffably California, and they could nuzzle into Laurel Canyon between the mystic hippies and the countrified indie scene of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/311-beachwood-sparks/"">Beachwood Sparks</a>. Zahner-Isenberg also has a knack for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6859-james-mercer/"">James Mercer</a>’s fussy, ship-in-a-bottle craftsmanship and seeming dichotomy between lyrical preciousness and guitar virtuosity similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill"">Built to Spill</a> circa <i>There’s Nothing Wrong With Love</i>.</p>
<p>So Avi Buffalo haven’t really expanded their range; they’ve gotten deeper and rootsier, making a record whose confidence is manifested by restraint. Opener ""So What"" finds Zahner-Isenberg handling a nimble melody in his middle register, while the chorus shrugs, a resigned, two-note mutter. The anthemic guitar strumming in ""Two Cherished Understandings"" is the closest they get to courting an unabashed singalong like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11607-whats-in-it-for/"">""What’s In It For?""</a>, though it teases at a huge chorus that never comes; at less than two minutes, it’s presented as more of an interlude. Choruses in general are switched out for nifty piano licks (""She Is Seventeen"") or glassy harmonies (""Overwhelmed With Pride""). You don’t get much of Zahner-Isenberg’s piercing higher range or his surprisingly hotshot guitar soloing, two things that defined and distinguished<i> Avi Buffalo</i>; the one time they do re-emerge is on, appropriately enough, ""Memories of You"".</p>
<p>Memories really don’t play as much of a role here as a whole anyway. <i>Avi Buffalo</i> felt nostalgic by default if you were older than the band, serving as a kind of aural summer camp. They were the hormone-charged campers, confounded by their own bodies; at other points, they were the counselors sneaking off at night to get drunk and go hook up themselves. <i>At Best Cuckold</i> is taken from the exact place Zahner-Isenberg inhabited in the interim—that of a dilettantish, kinda-college student, sorta taking himself and his relationships seriously while staying sorta pervy on Instagram. There he is on the cover, guitar and half-filled Solo cup on one side and likely a frightening world of obligation on the outside. He may get on with the day, but the look on his face tells you, “You go ahead, I’m gonna be here for a while.”</p>
<p><i>At Best Cuckold</i> abides by that more thoughtful, ceiling-gazing mindset. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9458-avi-buffalo/"">He described his writing process to Pitchfork as</a>, ""using this channel to talk about anything that's coming to mind...looking back and thinking, 'What am I writing?' Because you're trying to creatively express yourself, you'll end up with something you wouldn't have been able to tell yourself otherwise."" And Zahner-Isenberg has big ideas on his mind<span>—l</span>oneliness, escape, maturity, drugs, y’know, the usual. However, too often, in trying to tell himself what he’s feeling, he loses the listening, rambling too far from the emotional center.</p>
<p>Though the more lurid lyrics on <i>At Best Cuckold</i> may cause an occasional wince, they're necessary to bring Zahner-Isenberg back into the moment. During ""Memories of You"", ""Bitch, I’m on fire"" rhymes with ""You got magnum desire/ I’m a cheeseball on fire"", all while he questions the trustworthiness of his own perception. When he later admits, ""Couple nights ago I ran over two dogs/ Then I hate them after"", the scariest part isn’t his lack of pity—it’s him singing the title: ""Think It’s Gonna Happen Again"".  ""Oxygen Tank"" imagines Anton Chigurh exacting revenge on Zahner-Isenberg for loving too hard. He is ""Relatively/ Inconspicuously/ Overwhelmed with pride"" upon realizing, ""The birds seem so fucking free/ They’re nothing compared to me."" During ""Two Cherished Understandings"", he mewls, ""Years ago, I told you/ ‘Makin’ love, ain’t nothin’ wrong with that,'"" which possibly references a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9yBPcn8IqU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chris Rock bit about cornbread</a>.

Those admirable qualities have overshadowed the band’s considerable ambition: they’ve slapped together double albums, concept albums, and multi-song suites, all stuffed with winding melodies and tight, idiosyncratic vocal arrangements. <i>Commonwealth</i>, their eleventh studio album and first in three years, following graceful career highlight <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15407-the-double-cross/"">The Double Cross</a>,</i> pays titular homage to both the band’s Canadian heritage and their democratic songwriting partnership. It also manages to break new ground, no small feat when you consider they’ve been at this for a quarter-century: instead of their usual mishmash of each member’s compositions, each of the band’s four members has one full side to themselves, all coming together to make up a sprawling double album. The result is a widely varied collection, one that sheds light on each member’s distinct individual sensibilities and reveals the true strength of Sloan’s usual collaborative refinement process. </p>
<p>There's signature traits that have marked each Sloan album since their 1994 breakthrough <i>Twice Removed</i>. The band is so often, and so easily, defined by their creative debt to the great pop and rock bands of the ‘60s and ‘70s—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a>, yes, but also <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"">Big Star</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8595-todd-rundgren/"">Todd Rundgren</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2307-kiss/"">Kiss</a>—that it’s easy to lose sight of their more idiosyncratic strengths. They've never been a band inclined to linger on an idea or melody, even when putting together 30-track odysseys like 2006’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9798-never-hear-the-end-of-it/""><i>Never Hear the End of It</i></a>. They get in and get out, expressing themselves with the most possible potency before moving on to something else, and their economy has only improved as they’ve gotten older and more experienced. Every member of the band has written at least a handful of indelible, soaring vocal arrangements, many of which have marked their biggest hits, and all of them possess a distinct, pleasing voice, from Chris Murphy’s nasal charm to Jay Ferguson’s sweet, boyish tenor,with tension in the conflict between their differing tones. They never deny themselves another go at a chorus or hook, never resist another guitar solo, never reject a potential source of pleasure. This set of qualities have made Sloan a beloved band in their home country across multiple generations, even as more ambitious and self-conscious groups have won larger international fanbases and acclaim.</p>
<p>With that larger sense of identity in mind, how does each member’s side deviate from the established Sloan template? Over the course of their four mini-sets, they run from ornate orchestration and delicate melody to heavy-handed riffage and brute force, a range that’s rarely been expressed so widely on their other records. Jay Ferguson’s side hews closest to the Sloan sound that’s familiar to most listeners: straightforward melodies, a balance between melancholy and sunny, peppy tones, and intricate harmonies involving all four members. The purity and delicacy that set his voice apart from his peers in the band remains intact, and he uses it to sell both haunted ballads like “Three Sisters” and brisk stompers like “Cleopatra”. Those two songs close out a mini-suite that includes highlight “You’ve Got a Lot on Your Mind”, and when a quick callback to that song’s melody is snuck into the final half of “Cleopatra”, it’s like waking up and rediscovering a bunch of leftovers after an incredible dinner the night before.</p>
<p>Lead singer Chris Murphy—who’s written more Sloan songs than any of the band’s other members—strikes a middle ground between Ferguson’s gentleness and guitar-based muscle; his songs are differentiated by his sardonic wit and ability to generate a sense of propulsion. “Carried Away”, punctuated with handclaps and jangling tambourine, chronicles the dissolution of an open relationship and ends up seeming like a spiritual sequel to Murphy’s classic <i>Pretty Together</i> single “The Other Man”. On “So Far So Good”, he doles out perhaps the perfect example of his balance between gravity and comedy: “Don’t be surprised when we elect another liar/ Did you learn nothing from five seasons of <i>The Wire</i>?""</p>
<p>The two sides that close out <i>Commonwealth</i>—courtesy of lead guitarist Patrick Pentland and drummer Andrew Scott—are less immediately engaging than Ferguson and Murphy's sides, though for different reasons. Pentland, the writer of most of the band's biggest hits, typically strikes a fine balance between meaty power chords and pleasant melody; here, he opts for sludgy, slow-moving psych-rock riffs, dirtied by an array of effects. It's a major break from the album's first two sides, but not a particularly enjoyable one, and it's hard to get through the full set without yearning for the brightness and levity of the album's first half. Scott's suite marks a return to easily digestible composition, but it's contained within a formidable package: his one song, ""Forty-Eight Portraits"", stretches multiple movements over nearly 18 minutes. It's an impressive show of mental fortitude from the band member who usually tends towards complex, thematically dense tracks, employing a wide range of instrumentation and moving through several distinct moods, but it's not done any favors by its form. It can be tough to find alternate entry points into ""Forty-Eight Portraits"", and it's ultimately rendered somewhat impenetrable.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most accurate characterization of both ""Forty-Eight Portraits"" and <i>Commonwealth </i>as a whole is that of a noble failure. It's an interesting experiment, albeit less fulfilling than the band's best and recent work—but quality and relative position within their deep catalog aside, the album's very existence is heartening. Midway into their third decade together, Sloan aren't content to rest on their laurels or well-honed compositional skills. Instead, they continue to push themselves, refining their craft and toying with concept and form. This combination of curiosity and creative restlessness has rendered them more vital than bands half their age; nearly 25 years after ""Underwhelmed"", they're still trying to win you over.</p></div>"|19754.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19754-sloan-commonwealth/|6.9|Jamieson Cox

His brother is having none of it: ""You think I like watchin my back, forever on my pivots?"" he demands. ""You think I like crack? You think I like shootin niggas?/ You think I like runnin' from the cops like a loser nigga?""</p>
<p>This sharp little scene indicates what makes Wara's first full-length release so powerful: The margins of the songs are filled with the voices of friends and family. ""I was one of the only kids with a father figure and a brother in my house,"" Wara told <a href=""http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/the-break/2014/08/the-break-presents-wara-from-the-nbhd/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>XXL</i></a> recently. ""All of my friends didn’t really have fathers or brothers."" You can hear the community behind the Brooklyn-raised, Atlanta-based rapper/producer (the ""NBHD"" in his name just means ""neighborhood"") on <i>Kidnapped</i>, from the girlfriends he misses to the friends who tease him about wasting his time playing ""those stupid-ass piano chords"" (""Get In"").</p>
<p>And those piano chords are everywhere on <i>Kidnapped</i>. Wara, who produced and wrote every track, focuses his music on keyboards, jazzy and spare. They're punctured by bone-dry, sharp snares that you feel in your teeth. There are guitar sounds, too, intentionally tinny synth-patched ones; the whole effect is to transport us back to Wara's childhood, the years of dirt bikes and Jeeps and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3082-the-neptunes/"">Neptunes</a> beats everywhere. On ""Scrilla"", he specifically recalls ""Nodding off to 'Bobby James,'"" from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3021-nerd/"">N.E.R.D.</a>'s 2002 record <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5748-in-search-of/""><i>In Search Of...</i></a>, and <i>Kidnapped</i> almost feels like it sprung off fully formed from the head of that song alone.</p>
<p>Within this blueprint, though, Wara has a lot of his own ideas. ""I’m a person that’s strictly into details about everything, from the cover art to the song titles to album titles to everything that’s based around the project,"" Wara said in that same <i>XXL</i> interview, and <i>Kidnapped</i> has a nicely fussed-over whole feeling as a project. Many songs switch through two sections, often in different keys; ""Slangin"" has a soulful, sticky hook that only arrives after all the verses, and it gains more power when the key changes beneath and instrumental details begin coloring in the edges. A mournful trumpet cuts through the sound of gunfire on ""Raw"".</p>
<p>The song concepts are fresh: ""Annoyed"" is a love song, with a hook that captures first-relationship prickliness. ""I admit that I am a little cold-hearted, a little cold-hearted/ But most of the time, you're so fucking annoying,"" he complains. On the song's bridge (almost every song on <i>Kidnapped</i> has a chorus and a middle eight), he sings, ""Leave me alone/ But don't leave me alone, baby."" This idea—being unable to love, but yearning to—also cuts through on ""Fuck You Mean/Composure"": ""I wanna love, but don't know how to/ Can't quite break this lock, like I'm childproof,"" he observes.</p>
<p>This theme gains resonance within Wara's dead-tired vocals. He's based in Atlanta, but his voice is pure New York, a mix of Queensbridge-menacing and Harlem-slick. Those are modes that don't allow much space for messy emotions to maneuver, which makes these little glinting peeks more affecting. He stumbles into a flat bar every once in awhile (""Cut the check like a scissor move"", from ""Slangin"", ""Too busy stacking up my cream like an empty cone"", from ""Piano Lessons""), but Wara is commanding on the mic, demonstrating telepathy with his drum patterns and great ear for juicy-sounding word combos—""characteristics of the chisel-hearted,"" for instance. <i>Kidnapped</i> balances a lot of different virtues, as Wara's a writer and a slick rapper, a talented producer who knows how to shape an album's worth of songs into a world.</p></div>"|19725.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19725-wara-from-the-nbhd-kidnapped/|7.7|Jayson Greene

The tight-knit group of musicians swap around instruments and bands like a cough in flu season and churn out a seemingly endless succession of limited run, lo-fi cassette releases in the collective tradition of France’s<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_L%C3%A9gions_Noires"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Les Légions Noires,</a> Russia’s notorious Blazebirth Hall, and more recently, the intermingling in Iceland’s<a href=""http://www.metalsucks.net/2014/08/21/necrolust-best-eistnaflug/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> tiny but potent </a>black metal scene. By focusing heavily on the members’ shared interest in and veneration for their indigenous Mexican heritage, the BTC adds a compelling new voice to North American black metal’s overwhelmingly white, Eurocentric narrative. Of course, there are a massive number of nonwhite black metal fans in the States and in Mexico, Central America, and South America as well (to say nothing of Canada’s indigenous metal community), but when’s the last time you heard an American black metal band screaming in Spanish, let alone in the language of the Aztecs?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">BTC ringleader Volahn (né Eduardo Ramírez) places a huge amount of importance on his indigenous cultural ties and involvement with the <a href=""http://www.mexica-movement.org/timexihcah/identity.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nican Tlaca</a> movement, and many of the bands involved like Kuxan Suum, Blue Hummingbird on the Left, and Ramírez’s own eponymous solo project reflect those same sensibilities in their music by incorporating traditional instruments, Aztec imagery, and Nahuatl-language lyrics. By the same token, several BTC bands eschew these weighty influences in favor of more straight-forward metal or crust as exemplified by the decaying death metal of Muknal or the dark Bethlehem worship of Blood Play.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Mexico's <a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Xibalba/4232"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Xibalba</a> and Brazil’s Corubo pioneered the so-called “indigenous black metal” concept, but the Black Twilight Circle managed to reach a much broader audience thanks to both the quality of their material and the tantalizing veil of secrecy they draped upon themselves and the BTC’s cassette label, <a href=""http://crepusculonegro.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crepusculo Negro</a>. Unfortunately, the label also won notoriety via a slew of customer complaints about missing or outrageously delayed merchandise shipments, and the jury still seems to be out about that particular arm of the Circle (though when you’re mentioned in the same breath as <a href=""http://www.centurymedia.com/newsdetailed.aspx?IdNews=14836&amp;IdCompany=2"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blake Judd</a>, you might want to reconsider your business practices).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Rest assured, then, that the group’s latest release comes courtesy of the very reputable <a href=""http://www.theajnaoffensive.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ajna Offensive</a>, and they’ve outdone themselves with it, too. The Black Twilight Circle’s magnum opus, <i>Tliltic Tlapoyauak</i>, stretches two hours of new music from both established and brand-new members of the collective over three LPs. The collection starts with Kuxan Suum, whose Native roots are on full display thanks to its opening movement’s tribal percussion and haunting flute, and perhaps despite the chaotic scrapings that follow. Blue Hummingbird on the Left’s contribution, “Storm”, leans closer to outright war metal with nary a trace of the traditional instrumentation they’ve availed themselves of in the past. The Haunting Presence offers more of a cavernous black/death feel, cloaked under ragged production and punctuated by the odd frustrated grunt. They and Muknal represent two of the BTC’s brightest stars, and Muknal’s oppressive and engaging “Bringers of Filth” is a clear highlight.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Dolorvotre’s mad psychedelic tendencies are out in full force on the manic “Upward Spiraling,” a thoroughly nightmarish funhouse haunted by squealing strings and technical mania. Tukaaria sounds almost staid in comparison, but musters up some energy for the repetative four-odd minute “Nekaroa”. Volahn is one of the few BTC artists that boast the chops to stand alone from its brothers, and “Yaxche” is an excellent summation of why. Here, Black Twilight Circle ringleader Volahn offers intensity and clarity in equal measure, twisting light, fluttering guitar lines into perverse shapes. Kallathon follows Volahn’s example, relying more on a slower, simpler structure and veering towards full-on on atmospheric halfway through. The atmospheric, melodically inclined Shataan’s mournful beat and spritely flute contrast nicely with its namesake’s hopeless cries, and said flute distinguishes itself as the dominant voice within the song, which is otherwise tinged with dark rock and even a touch of goth in the vocals. Arizmenda’s track, “Rites of Deconsecration”, is perfectly chilling in its cold black grandeur while perennial odd man out Axeman get weirds with the Amebix-meets-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29263-killing-joke/"">Killing Joke</a> gloom of “Ride Into the Night”.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The Black Twilight Circle’s newest projects are a bit more hit or miss. In Lakech Ala Kin aim to recreate the primal darkness of Les Légions Noires fare but fail to make a real impact, while Cempopoloah takes a more straightforward raw black metal approach, with frantic near-clean yells in place of shrieks. Kampilan deviates from the script completely with “Battle of Mactan”, a 13-minute love song to funeral doom’s unsettling moans and desiccated tempo crossed with unexpected moments of complex, howling black/death. It’s one of the album’s most dynamic tracks, and highlights Kampilan as a band to watch. Blood Play revels in suicidal black metal’s histrionically miserable yowls and sadsack harmonies for an almost intolerable 7 minutes, but is redeemed by their sheer close association to Acualli, a commanding black/death trio that features the Circle’s only female member, bassist and composer Acatlán Coatlicue. There’s not much to differentiate Acualli from Muknal, and one wonders if the two had ever considered joining forces.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This marks a common theme within the Black Twilight bands—that is, the question of whether it’s really necessary for them to conjure up new bands to suit every riff fragment, instead of perhaps concentrating their assured talents within a small number of exceptional projects. Quality should trump quantity, a lesson the Black Twilight Circle is still learning. Overall, this collection makes for an excellent addition to the underground black metal fan or Black Twilight Circle completist’s arsenal, but like any other compilation of this ilk, will remain an impenetrable oddity for anyone without a solid appreciation for tinny guitars, absent production, and willfully strange compositions. It’s a step above the <i>Worship Black Twilight</i> compilation that kickstarted the fascination with the BTC, but shows that despite their lofty goals, these dudes (and now lady) would do well to learn to let go of their darlings and allow only the best to survive the cutting room floor.</span></p></div>"|19702.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19702-various-artists-tliltic-tlapoyauak/|6.6|Kim Kelly

Dreary, midtempo music often triggers that feeling, and those are two adjectives that could describe <i>Goddess</i>, the debut album by Jillian Banks, at both its best and worst. Banks is an American singer/songwriter in her mid-twenties who made it big after Zane Lowe played her single ""Before I Ever Met You""on his BBC Radio 1 show; with its dull greyscale backing track, the tune put all the emphasis on her voice, husky and rough around the edges. Banks' vocals carried an ambiguous and perpetual fatigue that might have been personal, or just a response to the crush of the world around her. As embryonic as it was, ""Before I Ever Met You,"" showed real promise, like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4347-martina-topley-bird/"">Martina Topley-Bird</a> for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">the Weeknd</a> generation.</p>
<p>In the year that followed, she hooked up with a number of fashionable, bubbling-under producers: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28501-shlohmo/"">Shlohmo</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29950-totally-enormous-extinct-dinosaurs/"">Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29589-lil-silva/"">Lil Silva</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30752-sohn/"">Sohn</a> have all put their magic on her vocal tracks, and she's built a coherent catalog by sucking the color out of their work, like some ravenous musical Marceline. When it works, the effect is mezmerising, with an atmosphere that hangs thick in the room like incense. But as with any scent so strong, it can just as easily linger and turn stale. Compare the Shlohmo-assisted ""Brain"" with last year's ""Waiting Game"", produced by Sohn. The former seems like a match made in heaven, but Banks ends up duetting with Shlohmo's distorted squalls, and the two lock step into one blandly weary march. ""Waiting Game"", on the other hand, is a naked ballad where Banks' voice floats high and reedy, and the only flourish is some wafting gospel vocals in the background.</p>
<p>""Waiting Game"" is Banks' best moment, a tortured torch song directed at another performer: ""What if I never even see you 'cause we're both on a stage/ But don't tell me listen to your song because it isn't the same."" It originally appeared on <i>London</i>, a 2013 EP that saw her backed up by UK artists Lil Silva, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29297-jamie-woon/"">Jamie Woon</a>, and Tim Anderson. They're also responsible for ""This Is What It Feels Like"", a should-be-smoulderer that can't quite ignite—imagine the writhing bassline from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29157-ginuwine/"">Ginuwine</a>'s ""Pony"" turned limp and lifeless. The tender ""Change"" comes from the same EP, while ""Warm Water"" is a holdover from last year as well. <i>Goddess</i> ends up with the hodgepodge feel of a music industry product that was forced to exist, rather than an album that came together naturally.</p>
<p>If <i>London</i> caught Banks at an especially vulnerable moment, showing off her range and raw emotion, then <i>Goddess</i> tries too hard to push in either direction, alternately shrouding her in smoke (""Stick"") or hammily over-emoting (""You Should Know Where I'm Coming From""). Opener ""Alibi"", another Sohn-produced cut, has an impassioned chorus, but her multi-tracked voice dissipates on impact, too wispy and rehearsed. On ""Goddess"", her run-on mushmouth obscures an otherwise fiery scorned lover narrative, and the same goes for the jaunty ""Fuck 'Em Only We Know"", where she practically whispers the chorus as if she were afraid to let a profanity slip.</p>
<p>Buried deep in the album is ""Beggin for Thread"", a brief respite of (relative) sunshine with perky drums and a lilting chorus. Catchy in spite of its desperate lyrics, there are moments where she sounds unpretentious and charming, which is more than you can say for the rest of <i>Goddess</i>. Banks' aesthetic often feels far too cultivated; it's all trendy misery assisted by equally fashionable producers, without any substance to hold it all up. Whenever she does try to get personal, the phrasing and lyrics come off stilted and awkward, the hallmark of a novice songwriter (""What if I said I was built on bricks of carelessness and crumbs?""). Armed with a voice that can go from brooding and low to spine-tingly icy in the span of one musical measure, Banks could certainly go places—but <i>Goddess</i> doesn't, and instead seems content to wallow in the same depressive rut for an exhausting 59 minutes.</p></div>"|19787.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19787-banks-goddess/|5.0|Andrew Ryce

Taylor is working for the weekend. “When Satuday comes, I’m gonna rock my soul,” he promises on </span><i>Lateness of Dancers</i><span>, his fourth full-length as Hiss Golden Messenger. “I might get a little crazy, I’m gonna drink some whiskey.” As the piano pounds out an insistent bundle of chords and the guitars carouse and stumble against one another, Taylor draws out that last word, savoring the syllables as though they’re the only thing getting him through the week. The song is less about raising hell and more about chucking your woes aside, unburdening yourself of your trouble and finding precious freedom in merriment.</span></p>
<p><span>Harvest is the general theme of </span><i>Lateness of Dancers, </i><span>not only marking one season’s labor to ensure survival through the next but also celebrating that work with a bit of whiskey and soul-rocking. Mixing regional folk and country traditions with strains of rock and R&amp;B, these songs strike a tone of convivial toil. Taylor has been working in the music business for nearly twenty years: first in the hardcore band Ex-Ignota, later with the San Francisco outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/842-the-court-spark/"">the Court &amp; Spark</a>, and most recently and most productively as Hiss Golden Messenger.</span></p>
<p><i>Lateness of Dancers</i>, named for a Eudora Welty short story, marks a transition commercially, if not creatively: Taylor’s first three albums were issued by North Carolina upstart Paradise of Bachelors, but this new one is his first for Merge. Taylor may have recorded these songs well before he signed that contract, but compared to previous albums, the arrangements on Lateness are airier, the tempos bouncier, the playing brisker. Largely absent from <i>Lateness of Dancers</i>, however, is the uncertainty that frayed the homespun <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18834-hiss-golden-messenger-bad-debt/"">Bad Debt</a></i> (recorded at Taylor’s kitchen table), the prodigal rambling that mapped out <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16546-poor-moon/"">Poor Moon</a></i>, and the spiritual inquisition that made <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17819-hiss-golden-messenger-haw/"">Haw</a></i> one of the hardiest country records of the decade. These songs are more about the reward that a Saturday provides.</p>
<p>At times <i>Lateness of Dancers</i> may sound too light, but after so many albums made during and about crises of faith, that tone is not unappealing. Taylor invited some of his North Carolina neighbors to back him on these songs, including guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29384-william-tyler/"">William Tyler</a>, brothers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29649-phil-cook/"">Phil</a> and Brad Cook from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7129-megafaun/"">Megafaun</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28236-mountain-man/"">Mountain Man</a>’s Alexandra Sauser-Monnig, and occasional Messenger member Scott Hirsch. They give the lightness of <i>Dancers</i> a real-stakes feel. On the would-be AM radio hit ""Lucia"" and the holler epic ""Day O Day (A Love So Free)"", the rhythm section in particular instills these songs with a not-quite-carefree spryness that sounds more like Memphis than North Carolina—but generally, they sound charmingly unrehearsed, as though they’ve simply gathered on someone’s back porch for the evening. There’s even a chorus of crickets in the interlude between the title track and “I’m a Raven (Shake Children)”.</p>
<p>Even when things turn dark, the music sounds unbowed. “The misery of love is a funny thing,” goes “Mahogany Dread”. “The more it hurts, the more you think you can stand a little pain.” Yet Taylor’s delivery is not anguished—more curious than rueful about the travails of romance—and when Hirsch’s organ and Tyler’s Stratocaster take over on the coda, that little pain actually sounds inviting, perhaps even a reward in itself. For some listeners, especially those who might discover Hiss Golden Messenger through this Merge debut, this persistently breezy tone may render the songs inconsequential, and certainly <i>Lateness</i> lacks the gravity of its predecessors.</p>
<p>But that just means this album sounds best in the context of the Hiss Golden Messenger catalog—as a comment on and a celebration of the spiritual and creative toil on the previous albums. It's a much less private record than what came before; in fact, Taylor relishes the company of his fellow Tarheel musicians. “I beat my drum, everybody to come running,” he sings on closer “Drum”, a new recording of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16382-hiss-golden-messenger-drum/"">a song that he first set to tape years ago</a>. On <i>Bad Debt,</i> it sounded like a quiet folk manifesto, as though he was laying out plans for a new chapter in his career. On <i>Lateness</i>, the song has the feel of fellowship, although not merely because the band elaborate on his sentiments with fiddle, tambourine, and banjo. Taylor sounds like a country preacher greeting parishioners as they leave the sermon some bright Sunday morning, bidding each of them to “take the good news, spirit it away.” He no longer carries the burden alone; we all shoulder it together.</p></div>"|19681.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19681-hiss-golden-messenger-lateness-of-dancers/|7.6|Stephen M.

And perhaps the reason for that is, in Plant’s case, the refusal to rest on his laurels has made him not more confrontational an artist but more congenial. From <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaL_3bdbbeQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the synth-smoothed pop</a> of his 1980s albums to the deep-seated obsession with late-’60s psych-folk <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF52VRaN_OY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">that flourished on 2002’s <i>Dreamland</i></a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3Xi5gvZ7Kk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his dust-up with bluegrass belle Allison Krauss</a> on 2007’s Grammy-winning <i>Raising Sand</i>, Plant has seemed almost embarrassed by the proto-metal bombast and legacy of lechery (not to mention the orgasmic, cathedral-shattering shrieks) that defined his ’70s tenure in Led Zeppelin. In recent years, he’s come to resemble the golden god who’s fallen down to earth, using his enduring star power to humbly pay cover-song reverence to the unsung heroes (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4456-townes-van-zandt/"">Townes Van Zandt</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2097-incredible-string-band/"">the Incredible String Band</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6124-arthur-lee/"">Arthur Lee</a>) he feels should be just as famous as he is, while educating himself on everything from Malian music to Bristol-school beat science. So while the recent round of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19418-led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-ii-led-zeppelin-iii/"">Led Zeppelin reissues</a> has been answered by a new album from Robert Plant’s old band, it’s not the one that made him famous.</p>
<p>For his first studio album in four years (and <a href=""http://www.nonesuch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nonesuch</a> debut), Plant is backed by the Sensational Space Shifters, a retooled version of the Strange Sensation band that supported him from 2001-2007. It’s an odd assemblage of U.K. rock lifers that includes a pair of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead"">Portishead</a> associates (keyboardist Justin Baggot and bassist Billy Fuller, currently a member of Geoff Barrow’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28220-beak/"">Beak&gt;</a>), <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4615-jah-wobble/"">Jah Wobble</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a> collaborator Justin Adams, and the guitarist from Britpop also-rans Cast (Liam “Skin” Tyson). However, while only Plant’s name appears on the cover of <i>lullaby and… The Ceaseless Roar</i>, the album is a collaborative, often improvised effort that’s defined as much by Adams’ production work with Tuareg blues rockers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5199-tinariwen/"">Tinariwen</a> and Gambian musician Juldeh Camara—who’s since joined the Space Shifters ranks—as by the whims of the group’s goldilocked frontman.</p>
<p>So for those who worried Plant was settling into a roots-rock comfort zone post-<i>Raising Sand</i>—a theory reinforced by a move to Austin and <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/robert-plant-disappointed-in-jimmy-page-and-led-zep-reunion-rumors-20140730"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reports</a> he would only reunite with Jimmy Page on acoustic material—<i>L</i><i>ullaby</i> reasserts his sense of globe-trotting adventure while retaining the low-key elegance of his post-millennial output. While the song rarely remains the same for Plant, the methodology does: Really, what he’s doing here stays true to the original spirit of Led Zeppelin—i.e., retrofitting Depression-era folk and blues for contemporary audiences—in a 21st-century globalized, WiFi-accelerated context, bringing together sounds archaic and modern, rustic and exotic, visceral and vaporous. But after years spent reinterpreting the work of others, <i>L</i><i>ullaby</i> sees Plant stepping up with his first batch of original songs in nearly a decade, answering his band’s derring-do with some of the most bravely confessional writing of his career.</p>
<p>Recorded in the wake of a failed relationship with folk singer Patty Griffin—Plant’s foil in his Cajun-spiced Band of Joy revival from 2011—and a retreat from his temporary home in Texas back to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Country"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black Country</a>, <i>L</i><i>ullaby</i> doesn’t readily announce itself as a break-up album. It begins with a radical reworking of the 1940s standard ""Little Maggie"" that essentially serves as a warm-up demonstration of the Space Shifters’ pancultural panache, keying on the percussive fingerpicking of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vXTTWZPXkw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Stanley Brothers version</a> and translating it into stuttering breakbeats, fuzz-covered synth pulses, and the disorienting drone of Camara’s ritti, a one-stringed West African instrument that produces a high-pitched squeal halfway between a violin and clarinet. And with Plant adopting an unobtrusive, airy vocal presence amid the dizzying whirr, it’s easy to initially overlook the cover’s true function: to thematically foreshadow the Plant-penned tales of lost love and suitcase-packed new beginnings that follow.</p>
<p>Ironically, for an album recorded on Plant’s home turf, <i>L</i><i>ullaby</i> feels more aesthetically informed by his travels away from it, with the Space Shifters’ free-ranging, continent-hopping sound resembling a whirlwind highlight reel from which Plant coaxes moments of quiet reflection. There are coy nods to his past: ""Pocketful of Golden"" shares its opening line with Zeppelin’s totemic ""Thank You"", though its heady sway more closely resembles Plant’s 1983 hit ""In the Mood"" given a bellydancer spin. And ""Poor Howard"" joins his <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YnsCMHDRP0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">equally impoverished buddy Tom</a> in Plant’s canon of winsome countrified shuffles (and revives the ""pretty little girl with a red dress"" archetype of <i>Dreamland</i>’s ""Red Dress"" in the process). ""Turn It Up"", meanwhile, is the Space Shifters’ chance to get the Led out, its bluesy churn resembling a swamp-covered ""Four Sticks"" in its heaviest moments, but Plant cheekily uses the moment to address the plight of a veteran artist who still gets the majority of his airplay from records he made 40 years ago: “I’m stuck inside the radio/ Turn it on, and let me out!”</p>
<p>Inevitably, with such a free-ranging mandate, there are times where the Space Shifters’ melting pot yields an indistinct gruel: ""Embrace Another Fall"" is <i>L</i><i>ullaby</i>’s most epically scaled track—loading up on ominous orchestral textures, a ritualistic drum rumble, arena-rockin’ guitar fireworks, and a grafted-on passage of an ancient Welsh folk song, ""Marwnad yr Ehedydd"", courtesy of guest vocalist Julie Murphy—but winds up sounding like some late-’90s chillout-comp castaway. Similarly, the closing ""Arbaden"", another reworking of ""Little Maggie"" to bookend the opener, ends the album on an unsatisfying, incomplete note, with Plant seemingly unsure of how the song’s melody fits into its percussive, synth-tweaked groove, only for the track to fade out inconsequentially before everyone can get on the same page.</p>
<p>But <i>L</i><i>ullaby</i> boasts several striking moments delivered free of winks or wanks, with the Space Shifters providing subtle illumination to Plant’s darkest hour on the plaintive, quietly devastating piano ballad ""A Stolen Kiss"", and a crystalline <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/524-the-byrds"">Byrds</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"">Velvets</a> jangle to the melancholic ""House of Love"", both of which candidly address his split from Griffin. And while they may not be fuelled by the same sense of longing and regret, the highlands-bound hymn ""Rainbow"" and the shimmering, paisley-patterned pop of ""Somebody There"" present golden opportunities to savor Plant’s ageless, eminently graceful voice—especially given that such opportunities appear to be running out. As he <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/robert-plant-interview-on-his-new-album-and-his-led-zeppelin-days-9683308.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently told <i>The Independent</i></a>, <i>l</i><i>ullaby and… the Ceaseless Roar</i> could very well spell the end of his “musical wanderlust,” claiming the album represents the purest synthesis of his myriad explorations over the years. And if not all of <i>L</i><i>ullaby</i>’s fusion experiments succeed, there’s enough inspired alchemy here to earn Plant the right to bring it on home.</p></div>"|19655.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19655-robert-plant-lullaby-and-the-ceaseless-roar/|7.0|Stuart Berman

The decision to use his birth name as the title of this record suggests something confessional after years of cloudy rumination, hinting at a genuine departure. Tricky even <a href=""http://consequenceofsound.net/2014/06/tricky-announces-new-album-adrian-thaws-streams-nicotine-love/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">refers</a> to it as his ""least introspective"" work. The reality is somewhat different, with a familiar world-weariness setting in, varying genre tropes getting applied then discarded, and a handful of guests coloring songs in around the edges. Ultimately, this is another Tricky album that drags the diminished expectations of anyone who’s heard <i>Maxinquaye</i> behind it, making a once-great work feel ever more like a millstone. At least he doesn’t appear tortured by his past—this is a quick follow up to last year’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18064-tricky-false-idols/""><i>False Idols</i></a>, implying that Tricky is in a fertile period, happy to be making music, out on his own imprint, and free of any label woes. He’s in a strange bubble now, wandering through a world where he’s lost to all but the most devoted of followers.</p>
<p>At least Tricky inspires loyalty in those he works with, including singer Francesca Belmonte, who returns to the fold to appear on a handful of <i>Adrian Thaws</i> tracks. Belmonte’s contributions, and those of promising London-based artist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31578-tirzah/"">Tirzah</a> (on ""Sun Down"" and a cover of Janet Kay’s ""Silly Games"") edge a little too close to work Tricky has undertaken elsewhere, occasionally replicating the half-spoken/half-sung cadence of former collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4347-martina-topley-bird/"">Martina Topley-Bird</a>. It’s clear that Tricky's post-<i>Maxinquaye</i> work has largely been about about firming up his province, which consists of a tiny sphere of sound resolutely his own. This album, like many of his other works, has been talked up in terms of departure, of a more club-oriented sound, although that’s largely an untruth, constructed as a hook to prick waning interests; there’s not much doubt where you are when immersed in the baked-out beats and lugubrious atmosphere of the Nneka-featuring ""Keep Me In Your Shake"".</p>
<p>For someone who was once so forward-thinking, there’s a touch of the retro blues to <i>Adrian Thaws</i>. ""Gangster Chronicles"" is built on a beat so old it mirrors the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-fgptF3snM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">George Semper</a> lift <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/877-cypress-hill/"">Cypress Hill</a> took for ""Insane in the Brain"", although Tricky at least delivers a surprise when he samples the vocal passage that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2696-massive-attack/"">Massive Attack</a>’s ""Unfinished Sympathy"" is centered around (from John McLaughlin and the Mahavishnu Orchestra's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxemCkIFFig"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Planetary Citizen""</a>). The latter is a moment of amusement, perhaps born out of a beef with his old colleagues. Whatever the intent, it at least brightens up the turgid slog through the middle of this record, which features an aimless limp through sloshed, bluesy crooning (""I Had a Dream"") and a misguided attempt at filtering the Middle Eastern conflict through the lens of a love story (""My Palestine Girl""). The latter is an unfortunate demonstration of the paucity of lyrical thought in this phase of Tricky’s career (“She’s close to God, I dribble like a dog”).</p>
<p>There’s not much on <i>Adrian Thaws</i> that distinguishes it from the direction Tricky has been heading over the past 15 years. This is a continuation of a mood he began etching out in song long ago, which he’s apparently either unwilling or unable to get away from, making it both the best and worst thing that’s ever happened to him. It’s a curious place to be, trapped in an airless corner of his psyche, full of suggestive thoughts that could be pried open and interpreted in infinite ways. Sometimes it’s more direct than that; on ""Why Don’t You"", Tricky settles on asinine rock riffing and a lyric that completes the title with: “...go and get fucked.” It’s the sound of his world emptying out, where all nuance is nullified in favor of white-knuckle <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/165-audioslave/"">Audioslave</a> riffing. Tricky’s played with rock before, of course, but ""Why Don’t You"" and the ""Silly Games"" cover that follows it are a nadir in terms of the inspiration he’s seeking. His process of filtering out the bad has failed him on <i>Adrian Thaws</i>, leaving an album that bears both his names but offers less of himself than ever before.</p></div>"|19780.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19780-tricky-adrian-thaws/|4.8|Nick Neyland

In posting this music most readily found in taxi kiosks in Dakar circa 1994, it’s a safe bet that Shimkovitz chose the former option over the latter, a bounty for western listeners.</p>
<p>In the intervening years, Shimkovitz’s mp3 blog has taken on a life of its own, with him DJing these tapes around the world as well as establishing a record label that presses these obscure cassettes to CD, vinyl, and even cassette once again, all of it under the moniker of Awesome Tapes From Africa. If you’ve attended one of his DJ nights, be it in Tasmania, Asbury Park, or St. Petersburg, Russia, chances are the first song of his set was Aby Ngana Diop’s “Dieuleul-Dieuleul.” While Diop is considered a mystery here, the liner notes that accompany the reissue of <i>Liital </i>offer a differing perspective: “Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Diop developed a reputation for being one of the most sought-after taasukats in Dakar, performing with her backup singers, dancers and drummers at parties, weddings and baptisms of the Dakar elite, including government officials and dignitaries.”</p>
<p>At a half-dozen releases so far for the imprint, I’m hard pressed to think of a more raucous example of just what makes many of these tapes earn the tag of “awesome” than “Dieuleul-Dieuleul.” Full of elephantine drums at full stampede, marimba sounds on a Yamaha DX-7, and piercing whistles, the jaw-dropping “Dieuleul-Dieuleul” sounds like a strange hybrid of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3086-nwa/"">N.W.A.</a>’s “Express Yourself” and raw UK jungle. The song, which translates roughly as “Take it, take it,” finds Diop at a bellowing roar, her staccato and vociferous delivery juxtaposed by a chorus of female back-up singers. If you're not able to parse Wolof, it’s hard to imagine she’s not furious, her vocals resembling a machine gun.</p>
<p>The battery of hand percussion and Diop’s fierce yelps rarely let up over the album’s six songs, and the result of listening through the tape can feel like putting your head in a waterfall, the pace and relentlessness of the songs rarely letting up. Polyrhythmic drums propel “Ndame,” as does a strange sample of galloping horses and what sounds like a coachwhip (the notes say that the horse sounds denote “success”). Similarly tricky are the thundering helixes of tama and sabar hand drums on “Yaye Penda Mbaye"".</p>
<p>The beats are undeniable throughout, and one wonders what might have happened had a hip-hop producer come across <i>Liital</i> in the mid-'90s. We know how <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"">Timbaland</a> took Abdel Halim Hafez’s recording of ""Khosara Khosara"" for ""Big Pimpin’"", and how DJ Quik heard a Bollywood film one night and twisted Indian singer Lata Mangeshkar’s ""Thoda Resham Lagta Hai"" into Truth Hurts’ ""Addictive"". Similarly, there are dozens of unruly beats to be found within <i>Liital</i> that could have readily become dancehall riddims or rubbery hip-hop tracks.</p>
<p>In the history of Senegalese music, <i>Liital</i> was groundbreaking, the first commercial recording to feature a traditional female griot fusing traditional taasu with the more modern mbalax. It propelled Aby Ngana Diop to the level of superstar in her native country, a status she held until her untimely death in 1997. Audacious and exotic to our ears, <i>Liital</i> is the sound of ancient griots meeting modernity, the sound of beats made for both Dakar dignitaries and obscure beat fiends.</p></div>"|19726.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19726-aby-ngana-diop-liital/|8.0|Andy Beta

Look past the questionable lyrics and behind-the-scenes debauchery, and it becomes clear that Interpol have been victims of unreasonable expectations. As with many pop cultural events that have taken place in the last 13 years, 9/11 plays a role, as <i>Turn on the Bright Lights</i>’ dark, impeccably styled catharsis took on an accidental resonance, despite being written before that cataclysmic day. With its iridescent glow and empathetic hook (“New York cares”), album centerpiece “NYC” carried a specific weight; around 9/11's tenth anniversary, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3970-suede/"">Suede</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5190-brett-anderson/"">Brett Anderson</a> <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/07117-brett-anderson-suede-favourite-albums?page=10"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">professed a love for the song</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5999-michael-stipe/"">Michael Stipe</a> covered it with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"">R.E.M.</a> in 2003, all of which suggested that Interpol should be considered a Serious Band.</p>
<p>The 12 years following <i>Turn on the Bright Lights</i>’ release, however, have only proven that looking to Interpol for profundity makes as much sense as installing a diving board in a kiddie pool. If we’re being real, the band’s ankle-deep tendencies started with <i>Bright Lights</i>, and that’s not necessarily an insult: like many bands surfing the new-rock wave at the time, Interpol turned shallowness into a kind of goofy virtue, the sonic equivalent of wearing sunglasses indoors. There was, and still is, nothing inherently original about what they were doing—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6412-peter-hook/"">Peter Hook</a> <a href=""http://www.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2010/12/09/joy-divisions-peter-hook-i-applied-for-carlos-ds-position-and-interpol-turned-me-down"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cheekily applied to be the band’s bassist</a> in 2010, only to be rejected—but in a musical climate jam-packed with call-backs to rock’s past, Interpol were, in their own way, innovators. They took the sonic template for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division"">one of the most serious bands of all time </a>and applied it to tales of white lines, late nights, and hetero-male woes that made “Entourage” look like <i>The Joy Luck Club</i>. In 2014, this is called “trolling”; in 2002, it simply sounded like a good time.</p>
<p>The years passed, and it became clear that Interpol’s talents could be listed on one hand, which was, again, not initially a bad thing. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4116-antics/""><i>Antics</i></a> from 2004 lacked the enveloping, cohesive atmosphere that made <i>Turn on the Bright Lights</i> such a striking debut, but the songs were definitely there. In 2007, Interpol did away away with the pesky, ill-fitting notions of “indie” (which the band only represented in sound, similar to how the term is still occasionally bandied about in the UK music press) by sensibly, and briefly, making the major-label leap to Capitol; the resulting record from that partnership, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10413-our-love-to-admire/""><i>Our Love to Admire</i></a>, is typically pinpointed as the moment Interpol started their steep, steady decline.</p>
<p>The chilly reception <i>Our Love to Admire</i> received at the time now seems a little unfair, and possibly the result of cultural fatigue; 2007, after all, was certainly not 2002, and Interpol’s stubborn refusal to show any progress after five years of visibility was a sign to many that the band’s slavish unoriginality was growing stale. In reality, <i>Our Love to Admire</i> represents Interpol at their most Interpol-iest—streamlined songwriting, crystal-clear production, lyrics directly referencing cocaine, a song called “No I in Threesome”—and if it’s not their best album, it’s certainly a hell of a lot better than what followed. The swaggering melodrama and shiny-suit dark pop of <i>Our Love to Admire</i> was, more so than ever for Interpol, redolent of bands from the ‘80s; this time, though, they approached the modern-day equivalent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1170-duran-duran/"">Duran Duran</a>’s empty-headed brilliance, a fitting full-circle since Carlos Dengler was known to wear a Duran Duran T-shirt during rehearsals for <i>Bright Lights</i>.</p>
<p>Regardless, <i>Our Love to Admire</i> was not a commercial leap, and so Interpol entered a new decade with a return to their old bosses at Matador and their fourth, self-titled album. Easily the band’s worst record to date, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14641-interpol/""><i>Interpol</i></a> was bereft of hooks, choruses, and other elements that make listening to music enjoyable. Four years later, they've all but disowned the record, judging by their set lists. So it’s understandable to approach the band’s fifth album in 12 years, <i>El Pintor</i>, with suspicion. The album’s title means “the painter” in Spanish, but it’s also an anagram for the band’s name, and the similarities to its predecessor don’t end there: as with <i>Interpol</i>, this new one’s 10 songs long, self-produced, with studio vet Alan Moulder handling mixing duties. The phrase “approach with caution” comes to mind.</p>
<p><i>El Pintor</i> isn’t “more of the same” in one specific way: it’s Interpol’s first album without Dengler on bass, following his departure in 2010; although <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6465-dave-pajo/"">Dave Pajo</a> served as his replacement on the tour promoting <i>Interpol</i>, the band’s a trio now, with frontman Paul Banks taking on four-string duties. Dengler’s absence is felt not least by the people in the band; Fogarino recently admitted to <a href=""http://www.nme.com/news/interpol/79523"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>NME</i></a> that Dengler’s talents were “a huge part of [Interpol’s] sound...You couldn’t take that away.” But <i>El Pintor</i> sounds like the work of a band revitalized, for the moment at least. There’s considerable energy in these songs, with just enough melodic smarts for <i>El Pintor</i> to rank as the fourth-best Interpol album—a dubious achievement, sure, but the failure of <i>Interpol</i> makes even that surprising.</p>
<p>There’s nothing here that touches the band’s creative peak, but any of <i>El Pintor</i>’s songs could hang with Interpol’s strongest deep cuts. With a red-herring of an opening that resembles the stately <i>Antics</i> opener “Next Exit”, “All the Rage Back Home” is the strongest up-tempo Interpol single since <i>Our Love to Admire</i>’s “The Heinrich Maneuver”, propelled by Fogarino’s jet-engine drumming and a chorus delivered by Banks, in his distinctive whine, that sounds as wistful as it does festival-ready. The tricky licks of “My Desire” fondly recall <i>Our Love to Admire</i>’s “All Fired Up”, while album highlight “Anywhere” cannily fuses the patient urgency of <i>Bright Lights</i>’ “Obstacle 1” and the proclamatory riffs of <i>Antics</i>’ “C’mere”.</p>
<p>If you’re starting to notice a trend here, then the ultimate failing of <i>El Pintor</i> is apparent: this is the sound of a band feeding on its past, a move that counters the bloodlessness of <i>Interpol</i> with a formula that is as moderately effective as it is uninspired. The slow, elegant majesty of “My Blue Supreme” is a re-trod of <i>Our Love to Admire</i>’s chiming “Rest My Chemistry”, the insistent throb of “Ancient Ways” essentially resembles <i>Antics</i>’ “Not Even Jail” rejiggered slightly, and so on.</p>
<p>The sole surprising moment arrives two-thirds of the way into “Ancient Ways”, when Banks breaks into a brief falsetto that shatters even Randy Jackson’s definition of “pitchy”; it’s quite possibly the most embarrassing thing Banks has ever done on record, and we’re talking about a guy who once sang the lyric <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE3vjUVbgwE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“You’re so young/ Like a daisy in my lazy eye”</a> with serious conviction. Lyrically, Banks has long been a punching bag, but his middle-school-poetry approach has grown endearing over time—and it’s also all but vanished from this decade of the band’s work. The most memorable lyric <i>Interpol</i> provided was when, in a bit of unintentional hilarity, Banks moaned “I’m a nice guy” on album opener “Success”; here, it’s on “My Blue Supreme”, in the form of the telling pre-chorus utterance “Only one in a hundred make it/ We fake until there’s nothing to fake.”</p>
<p>These lines could be interpreted a few ways—a commentary on the stylishness that Interpol once so exuded, a self-castigation of the band’s own derivative tendencies—but it could also be seen as a statement of survival. Circa <i>Antics</i>, the major-label-subsidiary market was flooded with Interpol soundalikes that ranged from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1422-engineers/"">not-bad</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1426-editors/"">not-terrible</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27428-white-lies/"">flat-out-awful</a>; they sounded like copies of copies, and by the time the major-label system sunk their claws into the real thing, the whole thing resembled an endless series of funhouse mirrors. With <i>El Pintor</i>, Interpol don’t sound as much like Interpol as they do a band that really wants to be Interpol; it’s a sad notion for anyone who once held this band’s music dear to their hearts, but taking into account what came before, it’s a miracle that Interpol still exist in this capacity at all.</p></div>"|19693.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19693-interpol-el-pintor/|5.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

For </span><i>Endgame</i><span>, the first Ital full-length to outpace the relatively compact statements of </span><i>Hive Mind </i><span>and </span><i>Dream On</i><span>, the results tend to drag and blur together even as the ideas are scattered across ten different tracks. Signs of earlier attention-getting juxtapositions linger, like the discolored concrete scars where an empty storefront's signage used to be—remnants of familiar symbols clearly meant to be there, yet conspicuous because of their absence.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It sounds immersive, sure: the record was mastered by Berlin go-to engineer Rashad Becker and mixed by psych/dub/noise polyglot <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30175-m-geddes-gengras/"">M. Geddes Gengras</a>, and the subsequent atmosphere and attention to detail that brings means it's a fairly satisfying listen just as pure sound. But even when there's a deep subtlety to the percussive layers and focus-shifting chords at the core of these songs, there's not always something to carry them once you're done acknowledging their gradual mutations. The way cymbal loops ricochet off one another (""Relaxer"") or shift from synthesized notes to percussive shards like liquid getting flash-frozen (""Dancing"") can be head-turning. And even if you could make a checklist off the obvious ideas here—there's even a take on vintage acid house (""Coagulate"")—<i>Endgame</i> makes a good case for a dual role as head/body music. Soak in its metamorphoses and stare into space, or let it roll through your system and make every joint feel ready to unwind—there's some decent diversions here.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But the characteristic discomfort and abrasion that set Ital apart from the more anonymous corners of minimal house and techno is dialed back to the point that, half the time, the music dissipates instead of builds. There's an exception or two, though: in particular, ""White II"" leads a late-album charge that finally works with the idea that this stuff can be bristling and intense in the right configuration. There's some honest-to-god </span><span>suspense </span><span>in the build, even before high-frequency synth chords start piercing the surface like skin-searing plasma bolts—but it also erases the fuzzy memories of minimalist minor-key gloom that came before it, as though the previous seven tracks were the calm before the storm that he'd usually structure a single track around. The whole album feels like a good enough time if you throw it on in the background, but as a follow-up to a deeper body of work that rides on fascinating ugliness, why not hope for something that actually commands your attention instead?</span></p></div>"|19706.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19706-ital-endgame/|6.5|Nate Patrin

On the surface, she’s a Canadian singer/songwriter like so many others, often performing with just a guitar and a stool, singing songs that conjure bygone country, folk, and blues traditions and that are lyrically steeped in richly detailed agrarian scenery and the travails of being a working mom. But Castle’s music is not so much of the earth as floating above it, untethered to the natural order of time and space and often eschewing typical verse/chorus/verse structure to roam according to its own wandering spirit. As <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh-GNnCwHj4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lou Reed famously sang</a>, “between thought and expression lies a lifetime,” and that’s where Jennifer Castle’s songs live—that grey area where observation mutates into rumination, and where the physical world dissolves into psychic terrain.</p>
<p>Castle's career path has similarly defied linear logic: After recording two albums as Castlemusic, the Toronto-based singer began releasing albums under own name in 2011, the first of which was titled, somewhat confusingly, <i>Castlemusic</i>. (In that time, she also became an in-demand guest vocalist, appearing on albums by local luminaries ranging from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29391-doug-paisley/"">Doug Paisley</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5160-fucked-up/"">Fucked Up</a>.) But as is the case with formerly aliased songwriters like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3144-will-oldham/"">Will Oldham</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan"">Bill Callahan</a>, the birth-name reclamation has coincided with a greater focus and clarity. <i>Pink City</i> is both Castle’s most warmly intimate and sonically immaculate work to date, forgoing <i>Castlemusic</i>’s naturally psychedelic reverb for a pristine, chamber-pop presentation that places Castle’s radiant voice front and center, amid malleable instrumental backdrops that introduce subtle shifts to substantive effect. Backed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6803-owen-pallett/"">Owen Pallett</a>'s palatial string arrangements and a gaggle of veteran Toronto players who’ve long straddled the boundary between the city’s indie-rock and improv-jazz scenes, <i>Pink City</i> is the sound of Castle hitting the pause button on the universe to linger on the beauty and absurdity of the everyday. </p>
<p>For newcomers, Castle exudes an instantly familiar quality: her melding of classic '70s AM-radio gold sounds and indie-schooled idiosyncracies imagines <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6841-joni-mitchell/"">Joni Mitchell</a> on Drag City, while her nocturnal reveries often bring to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/693-neko-case/"">Neko Case</a>—not in voice, but in the way her songs feel both desolate and expansive at the same time, invoking bucolic scenery not to merely admire the view, but to emphasize our humble position within it. (If Case was to ever issue a sequel to <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Amp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Canadian Amp</a></i>, the daydreamy piano-based serenade “Nature” would be a prime candidate.) But Castle’s deceptively sweet, wry lyricism project her peculiar personality on a widescreen scale, with Pallett’s string swells serving as the portal between her inner and outer worlds. The opening “Truth Is the Freshest Fruit” establishes an idyllic scene of flower-haired hippies frolicking in San Francisco’s Golden Gate park, but it ultimately represents a faded portrait of bliss that Castle can only dream of attaining; as Pallett’s orchestral shrieks pierce through the mix like an encroaching migraine, Castle repeats the line “born at the end of the year” with all the ennui of someone who’s endured a lifetime of having their birthday overshadowed by Christmas and who’s never enjoyed a celebratory piece of cake in the summer sun. </p>
<p>Similarly dispiriting images abound on <i>Pink City</i>, from the communal farmhouse dinner scene on the pedal-steel-powered “Sparta” that will soon be blotted out by the coming winter (whose chilly gusts are summoned with an “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLMF5GM0Kt8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Undun</a>”-worthy flute solo), to the helpless, childless narrator of “Nature” who’s resigned to her lot in life. (“I lift my skirt/ For the economy.”) And yet <i>Pink City</i> rarely feels like a downer of a record; with the exception of the incongruously melodramatic “Broken Vase” (and its “Riders on the Storm”-like vibraphone trickles), Castle isn’t so much interested in mining despair as the fortitude required to overcome it. <span>(Even if you're in absolutely no financial position to quit your day job and buy a houseboat, the soft-rockin' escapist anthem “Sailing Away” will at least help you keep the dream alive a little while longer.) </span></p>
<p>In Castle’s hands, even the most seemingly mundane scenes of domestic drudgery simmer with hot-blooded suggestion: the fingerpicked folk narrative “How or Why” is a tale of flora and fawning, functioning as both botany lesson (""digging holes in December means tulips in May"") and an affectionate account of a brief, torrid whirlwind affair. Tellingly, the closing title track revisits the same soil, but long after its nutrients have dried out: “Your old gardens remind me of what’s new in my life,” Castle sings over a sax-smoked cabaret torch song. But even as she treads upon dead earth, Castle’s connection to nature is potent as ever: with <i>Pink City</i>, she reminds us of how good it feels to be alive, even when life gets in the way.</p></div>"|19652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19652-jennifer-castle-pink-city/|7.9|Stuart Berman

It involves travelling to an upstate New York town where their gear was stolen, conditions turned wintery, and the band had to dig their way through thick snow to get to the studio each day. That paints a romantic picture of both isolation and commitment, with the band hunkering down to record as the world turned white around them. While the circumstances surrounding <i>Wooden Aquarium</i> suggest escapism, the music found inside is all grazed knees and furrowed brows—a brush with reality instead of a retreat from it. Mazes’ last album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17657-mazes-ores-minerals/""><i>Ores &amp; Minerals</i></a>, was a shift away from the slacker-lite indie of their debut. This album is a smaller turn of the wheel, albeit one still indebted to scruffy 1990s guitar-rock figureheads of a plaid-shirted vintage.</p>
<p>The question of identity is something that comes up often with this band, and other British acts (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28604-yuck/"">Yuck</a>, in particular) whose adherence to thick walls of guitar fuzz makes it clear they’ve grown up on a strict diet of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2693-j-mascis/"">J Mascis</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7151-ira-kaplan/"">Ira Kaplan</a> riffs. At least Mazes approach such cross-continental thievery with a dose of wit; the standout cut from this record, “Salford”, pings back and forth across the Atlantic many times. Guest vocalist Heather Strange twists American vowels around singer Jack Cooper’s distinctly English take on the Greater Manchester borough of the title, while the music is a straight throw-down between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"">Pavement</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3404-prolapse/"">Prolapse</a>, pitching it somewhere between tunefulness and abrasion. In a lyrical sense, it’s Mazes’ most English song to date, making Strange’s contribution feel like a buffer to prevent them from revealing too much of themselves—which in itself gives the song an odd, unique weight.</p>
<p>Cooper rarely stretches the band beyond “Salford”, instead settling into a set of unfailingly polite indie-rock songs centered around gently ambiguous lyrics. There’s an affable swipe at those who think Mazes lean too far to the other side of the Atlantic in the title of “Explode Into Colo(u)rs”, although it’s crafted from a mélange of clear-cut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3724-the-sea-and-cake/"">Sea &amp; Cake</a> guitars and the spare atmosphere of old <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4015-swell/"">Swell</a> records. The general position of <i>Wooden Aquarium</i> is inward-facing, with highs coming when the band disconnects from traditional songcraft, such as on the merge of chattering voices on “RIPP”—making it something like the well-turned-out cousin of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1677-gang-of-four/"">Gang of Four</a>’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQS7vx5xy9c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Love Like Anthrax”</a>. There aren’t quite enough moments like that here, and the album could benefit from bringing back some of that diversity in its back half, when it settles into a long bout of well-meaning but ultimately forgettable wistfulness.</p>
<p>Cooper has <a href=""http://sloucher.org/2011/05/24/interview-mazes/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> he doesn’t like getting compared to other acts, but there’s never a sense that he’s working too hard to get beyond his influences, such as the moment where he adds a little <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3375-the-posies/"">Posies</a> with a dash of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"">Real Estate</a> by way of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5948-the-feelies/"">the Feelies</a> (“Mineral Springs”). The difference between those bands and this one is in the finer details—Real Estate’s best songs, for example, are just a touch brighter, sharper, and more memorable than the ones Mazes have presented here. It’s not the borrowing that’s the problem, it’s the execution and delivery, coupled with moments of distinction (“Salford”, “RIPP”) that suggest this band could touch down in a better place on a more regular basis. On <i>Ores &amp; Minerals</i>, there was a measure of spaciness that’s been lost here, perhaps surprisingly considering the circumstances of its birthing. If that album was a leap, this one is a step, and a gingerly one at that.</p></div>"|19729.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19729-mazes-wooden-aquarium/|6.7|Nick Neyland

The duo's identities are anonymous, a ploy that in 2014 is more likely to camouflage 10-year industry vets than shy upstarts. Their name—presumably an attempt to phonetically reproduce a drum pattern—seems designed embarrass anyone asked innocuously by a co-worker, ""Hey, what are you listening to?"" and will likely inspire more copying and pasting than any other artist releasing an album this year. Most importantly, they produce a style of UK techno that, owing its roots to industrial and experimental music instead of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk/"">Kraftwerk</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3256-parliament/"">Parliament</a>, can sound particularly sexless and austere. Indeed, a <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=SHXCXCHCXSH&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1446&amp;bih=881&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1sEHVK2rLdKzogTUnYGQCA&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Google image search</a> (copy, paste) scouting a glimpse of the duo returns a set of results that are hilariously monochrome.</p>
<p>It's worth keeping all of this in mind because the duo's second album, <i>Linear S Decoded</i>, seems all the more impressive for making you forget, or at least forgive, all of these barriers to entry. A humid, moldering set heavy on atmosphere, <i>Linear S Decoded</i> is also rhythmically tricky, sly, and, if you squint, playful, nodding fondly toward ambient and rave music. This, as well as the fact that SHXCXCHCXSH have gone out of their way to craft a capital-a Album, set <i>Linear S Decoded</i> apart from a growing wave of European producers working in techno's blackest margins, a trend that has produced some <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18960-untold-black-light-spiral/"">intriguing works</a> but also a lot of dour, gloom-gloom-hisssss-gloom pounding.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Linear S Decoded</i> spends a lot of time hovering in place, refusing to build momentum—a rarity in a genre where continuous pounding is a prerequisite. There are lots of heavy, distorted noises and no shortage of four-on-the-floor kick patterns, but nothing that should be described as truly punishing; as a result, <i>Linear S Decoded</i> never feels like punishment. They've replaced UK techno's sadistic carnival with a mossy softness, a reminder that while factories and cities decay and corrupt, so do cabins and farmhouses. These are the same ideas that SHXCXCHCXSH explored on their 2013 debut, <i>STRGTHS</i>, an album that too often resorted to dull thudding.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Like a child stopping just short of anything that might merit scolding, SHXCXCHCXSH paw at viciousness without ever committing to it. Songs that might've been unrelenting, throbbing assaults take long strolls through azure ambient passages (""The Roots""), or they move in fits and starts, eventually collapsing into broken beat litter (""The Under Shore""). The album crests during ""This Hmming Raverie"", offering a serrated synth riff that, in a different context, might've been a cheesy, hands-in-the-air rave anthem.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">And it's a fair assumption that SHXCXCHCXSH wouldn't mind if you did throw your mitts skyward. About their name, at least, they have a sense of humor: when asked how to pronounce their name, <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/podcast-episode.aspx?id=430"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">they responded</a>, ""The Hs are silent. Except that, you do it like it’s written."" Or see the sodden knolls of the final track, cheekily titled ""Monolithic Conclusion"". SHXCXCHCXSH have a light touch with heavy sounds, and as a result <i>Linear S Decoded</i> is the rare album that allows you to wallow in the techno muck and come out feeling vitalized.</p></div>"|19793.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19793-shxcxchcxsh-linear-s-decoded/|7.3|Andrew Gaerig

On <i>Earth 2</i>, he wielded his instrument and amplifiers with a powerful precision, creating sounds that weren’t only big but also topographically rich; you could study the curves and crags of his sound as if you were reading a <a href=""http://www.flyfishinginsidernewsletter.com/053010/streamwatch-02.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">three-dimensional map</a> of the Cascade Range. When Carlson rebuilt Earth as an instrumental rock band a decade ago, he used his guitar to cut a filigree of exquisite riffs through the bedrock of Adrienne Davies’ patient drumming. Hearing him play during <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11218-the-bees-made-honey-in-the-lions-skull/""><i>The Bees Made Honey in the Lion’s Skull </i></a>suggested a woodworker cutting soft, delicate shapes into an enormous oaken block. Whether working on the monolithic scale of Earth’s origins or through the microcosmic scope of its rejuvenation, Carlson has always handled his duties like a master puppeteer with supreme, expressive sway.</p>
<p>The most telling moment, then, of Earth’s latest LP arrives with “Even Hell Has Its Heroes”, an instrumental that finds Carlson fighting against Earth’s need for stricture and structure with bona fide guitar solos. Above a bed of dense, multi-tracked guitars, he even trades licks with <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2011/11/brett-netson/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Built to Spill's Brett Netson</a>. The song begins as archetypal latter-day Earth, the notes pneumatically bolted to the beat. Carlson’s tone, however, is a bit more pointed than usual, and he and Netson soon unspool the song’s theme into spirals of variations, taking liberties with their leads rather than submitting to Earth's usual economy. Supported by Netson and <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/390972-Randall-Dunn"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">producer Randall Dunn</a>, Carlson is free to step out near the seven-minute mark; you can almost picture him with his eyes closed and jaw titled skyward, fingers feeling the strings and flying across them rather than calculating where and when the melody must land. It’s one of the most electrifying moments in Earth’s inconsistent quarter-century history, a genuine rock ’n’ roll climax for a band that’s mostly marched slowly, steadily into the middle distance.</p>
<p>Those licks speak to a restlessness that defines <i>Primitive and Deadly</i>, the first Earth album to feature vocalists since Carlson sang a little in the mid-’90s and since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14804-a-bureaucratic-desire-for-extra-capsular-extraction/"" target=""_blank"">Kurt Cobain and Kelly Canary signed on for the group’s earliest work</a>. Former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4122-screaming-trees"">Screaming Trees</a> frontman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2422-mark-lanegan/"">Mark Lanegan</a> slips inside two tracks, sending up his dark-eyed observations about destructive dawns and grim landscapes with his static, speak-sing clip. Despite Lanegan’s stentorian voice, he gets lost inside Earth’s latticework, his voice often feeling more like a footnote than a new feature. “Children, children, get ready/ You better get ready/ It’s new revelation time,” he musters during “The Serpent is Coming”, trying to twist some soulful cadence into his stiff proclamations but coming across like a revival preacher being overrun by his congregation. During “Rooks Across the Gate”, he reads the text of some macabre fever dream, the Carlson-penned lyrics suggesting the murder ballads he’s encountered in his studies of European folk. Despite the scare of the material, though, Lanegan undersells the images. It’s possible to ignore his echo-enhanced voice altogether, to overlook it in favor of the sharp rhythmic interplay between Carlson, Davies, and bassist Bill Herzog. The idea of Earth’s desolate music augmented by harrowing visions solemnly delivered is an intriguing one, but Lanegan’s execution is inchoate and underwhelming. Next time, perhaps <a href=""http://vimeo.com/61407576"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nick Cave</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxZpEFJhO6k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">David Tibet</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90GVrwiE-8Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Julian Cope</a> can be on standby?</p>
<p>Where Lanegan missteps by giving Earth a kind of deferential distance, <a href=""https://www.subpop.com/artists/rose_windows"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rose Windows </a>singer Rabia Shaheen Qazi succeeds by using their music as a platform. She commands during<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16959-earth-from-the-zodiacal-light/"" target=""_blank""> “From the Zodiacal Light”</a>, the album’s first single and 11-minute centerpiece. Invoking <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3180-ozzy-osbourne/"">Ozzy Osbourne</a> and Sandy Denny, she perches above the band to deliver a sermon of fear and salvation. Bewitching and intimate, she represents the vocal fulfillment of the balance between black, white, and gray that Earth has pursued with guitars, drums, and bass for the last decade. The band moves perfectly with her and the words. During the song’s more fraught moments, the trio tenses into moments of feedback and pause; late in the track, when Qazi lingers between the future and failure, the band slinks into a similarly indecisive circle. This is doom metal, delivered with the very grace and meticulous design that’s characterized Earth’s second life.</p>
<p>Earth has now existed for longer and made more records as a set of subtle, almost-quiet instrumentalists than as the jolting, pioneering volume lords that first earned Carlson a reputation. And though the albums made between 2005’s <i>Hex; Or Printing in the Infernal Method</i> and the two-volume <i>Angels of Darkness, Demons of Light </i>set offered variation with a rotation of keyboards, basses and cellos, they all mined a similar aesthetic. <i>Primitive and Deadly</i> even begins by recapitulating every phase of the band’s career, as opener “Torn by the Fox of the Crescent Moon” attaches the finesse of latter-day Earth to a touch of downtrodden, heavy doom. But Earth have seemed overdue for a change, and these songs collectively represent a promising half-step toward it. This is the closest Carlson has ever been to leading a rock band, to fully offloading his exceptional sense of control into a systemic and thorough whole. This isn’t quite, as Lanegan suggests, “a new revelation,” but sure, children, go ahead and get ready: This might be the beginning of a new Earth. </p></div>"|19777.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19777-earth-primitive-and-deadly/|7.0|Grayson Haver Currin

It carries constant reminders of the indifference it faced in numerous record label offices: catchphrases and namedrops that would’ve been timely had the record dropped a year or so ago, big-name producers appearing as courteous gestures and for quick paychecks, a tracklist riddled with guest verses and collaborations that somehow seem reverent and disrespectful at the same time. As with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4718-young-jeezy/"">Jeezy</a>’s previous LP, 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16140-thug-motivation-103-hustlerz-ambition/""><i>Thug Motivation 103: Hustlerz Ambition</i></a>, all of these things are present on <i>Seen It All: The Autobiography</i>. Similarly, the fact that it’s any good at all might be a greater testament to Jeezy’s skills than his albums that are actually great on their own terms.</p>
<p>You might’ve noticed that Jeezy's dropped the “Young”, but that’s the only time the transitional nature of <i>Seen It All</i> is entirely his doing. The guy is in a spot that makes executive decisions more difficult: he’s still bankable, but not an A-lister. He calls out Def Jam's endless meddling by name in “Me OK”, all while threatening to drop his album on Atlantic. But since it’s the hottest track here, the bosses ostensibly let it slide. Moreover, Jeezy struck up a valuable alliance with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32441-dj-mustard"">DJ Mustard</a> and even if you don't remember a single track from<i> TM103</i>, it still sold 233,000 copies in its first week.</p>
<p>He’s given tracks from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31333-mike-will-made-it/"">Mike WiLL Made-It</a> and Drumma Boy, which barely sound that different from what Shawty Redd provided Jeezy on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8916-lets-get-it-thug-motivation-101/""><i>Thug Motivation 101: Let’s Get It</i></a>. But their beats lack that record’s assured sound. Jeezy’s more respected than influential right now—the sound of Atlanta rap bears more in common with the vocal and lyrical unorthodoxy of his former rival <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane"">Gucci Mane </a>or current collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">Future</a>—making Jeezy a classic rock riffer in a post-punk world, which means he’s lasted long enough to possibly appeal to the purists who dismissed him back in 2004.</p>
<p>It’s not necessarily an insult to call Jeezy a punchline rapper at this point. That’s what he’s always been, really—his bars were all slogans, ad-libs, and smart/dumb similes that were delivered so confidently, you could only briefly eye-roll before ad-libbing right along with him. He made light of this on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12159-the-recession/""><i>The Recession</i></a>’s “Word Play”, which silenced the “lyrical” heads with half a bar—“I’m way too intelligent/ To play with my intelligence.”  And here, Jeezy delivers a host of howlers with the aplomb and lack of quality control you’d expect from a stand-up working out new material. He’s got birds like Chick-fil-A; however, he’s on the block on Sundays, <i>unlike</i> Chick-fil-A. He boasts about having a cooking show on Netflix called “The Best Bricks”, which, come on—at least call it “House of Birds” or ""Orange is the New Crack"". He also rhymes “Plaxico” with “Texaco” like Gucci Mane, and “Atlantic” with “Atlantic” like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross"">Rick Ross</a>, so you're left reminiscing about a time when all three rappers were all actually still beefing and making great music.</p>
<p>This makes <i>Seen It All</i> intermittently enjoyable, even if it completely cuts against the presumed goal of presenting Jeezy as an elder statesman of the South along the lines of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/615-bun-b/"">Bun B</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3707-scarface/"">Scarface</a>. It’s a transformation that’s occurred by circumstance rather than growth; the dude doesn’t tell stories and, while pithy, he doesn’t spit wisdom. Jeezy’s music is post-triumph and visceral, channeling the power of what it feels like to be Trapper of the Year four years in a row even if you're doing concentration curls or a heavy load of laundry, or you're just enduring a long commute back from your office job.</p>
<p>And that’s still the case, as <i>Seen It All: The Autobiography</i> doesn’t deliver on either one of its titular promises. Here’s what we can tell about Jeezy’s life: he experienced much success as a drug dealer prior to rapping, he has a lot of guns and has fallen out with friends over money, and he really thinks you should try Tequila Avion because it's fucking awesome. Given the number of times it's mentioned, <i>Seen It All</i> could pass for a longform Avion commercial; you'd think the first 35 years of Jeezy's life were mere prelude to being named a <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2013/09/30/ken-austin-and-jeezy-how-they-came-together-to-grow-a-tequila-brand/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Multicultural Advisor""</a> for the brand.</p>
<p>Which results in Jeezy being shown up by every rapper who’s willing to offer something close to full disclosure. If not remorse, Lil Boosie shows the real consequences <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/54246-lil-boosie-released-from-prison"">of his jail sentence</a> on “Beez Like”, bemoaning how he missed the first time his daughter had her period. And though he has nothing to gain by doing so, even<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z""> Jay Z</a> is willing to name names and get specific about his days <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tWmyPMf3wU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">herbin' 'em in the home of the Terrapins</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you've heard it all on <i>Seen It All</i><i>: </i>there’s something called “Been Getting Money” and you could probably come up with 85% of it in your head before your first listen. (I’ll spot you “ft. Akon” as a hint.) Conversely, a Jeezy track named ""Black Eskimo"" could never live up to what you think it might sound like. There’s a six minute song with Rick Ross and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1840-the-game"">the Game</a>, which is no fun now that they’re all getting along with each other. The deluxe edition contains “Fuck the World”, which features R&amp;B seat filler August Alsina and is only notable for being a Jeezy love song that isn’t as embarrassing as “Tear It Up”.</p>
<p>But none of this really seems to matter right now, because a 38-year-old man was shot and killed at a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa"">Wiz Khalifa</a> concert and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/56461-jeezy-arrested-after-wiz-khalifa-concert"">Jeezy was recently held in custody with five of his associates</a> on $1 million bail. It will inevitably be used as a “teachable moment” about Jeezy and hip-hop as a whole and make <i>Seen It All</i> a footnote, but those are the least of the problems presented here—a man is dead and Jeezy may have had something to do with it, and even shittier is that you’re reminded of Jeezy’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/53511-young-jeezy-arrested-on-charges-of-battery-false-imprisonment-and-terroristic-threats-against-son/"">other, very disturbing 2014 run-in with the law</a>. So maybe the vagueness of <i>Seen It All</i> actually works in its favor: had it been autobiographical, it may have been even more inherently sad than it already is.</p></div>"|19786.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19786-young-jeezy-seen-it-all-the-autobiography/|6.0|Ian Cohen

So begins ""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76xZiuUxI6k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Cowboy's Prayer</a>"", a couple stanzas of boot-and-saddle wisdom made famous by Roy ""King of the Cowboys"" Rogers. In 2011, Mutual Benefit's Jordan Lee happened upon a recording of Rogers reciting this ""Cowboy's Prayer"" at the tail end of a cross-country trip he'd taken in the aftermath of Hurricane Irene. Lee, his mind reeling from the scenes of displacement and destruction he'd witnessed in Irene's wake, found something to cling onto in Rogers' time-worn adage. ""Lord, when trails are steep and passes high,"" Rogers' benediction reads, ""help me ride it straight the whole way through."" These lines quickly became something of a mantra for Lee, and he named <i>The Cowboy's Prayer</i>—his final EP before his 2013 breakthrough <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18669-mutual-benefit-loves-crushing-diamond/""><i>Love's Crushing Diamond</i></a>—after Rogers' cattleman's litany.<br/><br/>Lee's pre-<i>LCD</i> EPs—many of which are still available for free download on Bandcamp—split the difference between ambition and naiveté; one needs not look much further than Lee tethering a natural disaster and a TV cowboy's sign-off for proof of that. Taken together, however, and a picture starts to form: an eager kid, earnest to a fault, equally besotted and bewildered by the world around him, looking to make some sense of being young in the old, weird America. Lee's penchant for dressing up his dewy pastorals in heavy syrup was in place pretty much from the jump, but on those early EPs, there's a frequent disconnect between the two sides, one he would eventually close as the years trickled on. At its best, the five-song, 15-minute <i>Cowboy's Prayer</i> feels like a dry run for what Lee would accomplish with <i>Love's Crushing Diamond</i>.<br/><br/>Opener ""Auburn Epitaphs"" matches an effects-spackled piano loop with a pair of ambling guitar figures, as Lee—his voice sweet, slightly shaky, the sound of a guy still Figuring It Out—grapples with the supposed futility of writing about something larger than himself. The plaintive, banjo-led ""Passenger"" breaks into a cloud-parting chorus before the whole thing's swept up in swirl of spectral synths. With the benefit of hindsight, it's easy to see all the elements of <i>LCD</i> there in this opening twofer. Yet the balance isn't quite right: the songs are more halting, his voice a hair meeker, and the accoutrements distract nearly as often as they delight. The faint pulse and nest of wriggling keyboards that kick off ""The Cowboy's Prayer"" seems to betray Lee's fascination with the so-called ""lap-pop"" of the early '00s, a curiously uncharacteristic experiment that lets a heavy-handed arrangement to crowd out the threadbare melody behind the fluttering electronics.<br/><br/>Going back through the early EPs, it's clear Lee's knack for letting involved arrangements blow through his songs wasn't always in place the way it happened to be on on <i>LCD</i>. By the time <i>The </i><i>Cowboy's Prayer</i> rolled around, he'd found a way to keep the scraping strings and rustling chimes from overpowering the songs; yet ""The Cowboy's Prayer"" itself is an overreach, the kind of I'll-try-anything juvenilia Lee had to work out of his system before landing on the more surefooted sound of <i>LCD</i>. With its flickering triangles, wheezing pump-organs, and smattering of strings, ""Backwards Fireworks"" takes its sweet time getting going. But once Lee starts in on the ""burning highway effigies"" he'd witnessed—or maybe dreamed—on his post-Irene jaunt through the country towns, it's <i>Prayer</i> at its most graceful, a fractured middle-American fairy tale set to the plunk of a couple-three banjos. Unfortunately, instrumental closer ""招魂""—which translates to ""evocation"" or ""spiritualism""—seems more ""sketch"" than ""song,"" a backdrop begging for a little more action in the foreground.<br/><br/>In a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/9273-mutual-benefit/"">2013 interview with Pitchfork's Ian Cohen</a>, Lee described a chance meeting with a St. Louis-based violin player named Jake Falby that helped shape the sound of <i>Love's Crushing Diamond</i>. ""The record originally had Casio violins… but after he did these beautiful arrangements, I spent another eight months tweaking it so that it was absolutely perfect to me."" Though Lee remains Mutual Benefit's only permanent member, it's clear that what he'd envisioned for <i>The </i><i>Cowboy's Prayer</i>—that searching, starry-eyed Americana—came to fruition on <i>LCD</i> through time, patience, and more than a little outside help. Lee would soon shed some of the more intrusive, out-there arrangements, letting the conceptual dot-connecting fall by the wayside, and bringing his songwriting closer to the forefront. By the time <i>The Cowboy's Prayer</i>—clumsy in parts, underformed in others—came around, Lee was clearly closing in on something. But it wasn't until <i>Love's Crushing Diamond</i> that Lee would follow that path straight the whole way through.</p></div>"|19776.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19776-mutual-benefit-cowboys-prayer-ep/|6.3|Paul Thompson

""I’m still too close to it to talk about it without getting angry,"" the vocalist/multi-instrumentalist for the defunct collage-pop duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45239-nick-zammuto-talks-about-ending-the-books-starting-his-new-project/"">told Pitchfork</a> back in 2012. When asked about the pointed lyrics on his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16433-zammuto/"">self-titled solo debut</a> from that year, he opened up a little bit more: ""Everyone’s got a brass robot in their lives that they want to tear a new one, right?"" He went on to refer to his last record with Books member Paul de Jong, the meditative 2010 effort<span> </span><i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14459-the-way-out/"">The Way Out</a></i>, as ""an optimistic attempt to see if it could still work""; although the record stands as the slightest in the Books’ singular catalog, its mix of new age affectations, torrents of rhythmic underpinning, and straightforward humor never suggested the work of two people having trouble staying in the same room from each other.</p>
<p>Even though Zammuto described his inaugural solo bow as ""about making that difficult decision to cut your losses and move on,"" the record brimmed with a giddy sense of wonderment. Endings are hard, though, and two years later, it doesn’t quite seem like Zammuto has come full-circle in the grieving process. The <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETMhibbH2bA&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> for ""IO"", a single from his second solo album, <i>Anchor</i>, seems innocuous at first, a documentation of Zammuto and cohorts building a large-scale catapult to set soaring a variety of objects into the surrounding scenery (perhaps a visual equivalent to the artist’s more frenetic musical moments). It seems to be all in good fun—that is, until the 1:20 running mark, in which <a href=""https://twitter.com/TempResLtd/status/503970631235698688"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the HP computer used to make <i>The Way Out</i></a> is loaded, launched, and smashed into the ground. When it lands, Zammuto himself is seen gleefully running after it with a sledgehammer, which he makes use of on the surviving hardware.</p>
<p>So the specter of  failure still looms over his work, and it’s hard not to see <i>Anchor</i> as an extension of that mood. The frozen, wintry album art is the inverse of <i>Zammuto</i>’s verdant-spring look, and what’s inside is similarly chilly, a downcast collection of tunes that counts as Zammuto’s most low-key work since the Books’ underrated 2005 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/856-lost-and-safe/""><i>Lost and Safe</i></a>. The record marks a specific shift in Zammuto’s sound—more straightforward, less nervy, a Rube Goldberg device replaced with a single manual lever—but there are a few moments where his earlier sound shines through. ""Need Some Sun"" rests on daisy-chained thrums of bass strings, Zammuto’s silvery voice weaving in and out of the web the four-stringed instrument weaves; a burst of bleeps gently disrupts the sparseness of ""Great Equator"", while album closer ""Code Breaker"" engages in some intricate tonal work that should please anyone who’s taken comfort in former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"">Emeralds</a> member <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29178-mark-mcguire/"">Mark McGuire</a>’s expansive rock hypnosis.</p>
<p>Otherwise, <i>Anchor</i> lacks excitement and Zammuto’s trademark ingenuity. He sounds uninspired and bored, with arrangements that rustle unhurriedly and a sense of stiff formalism reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/356-andrew-bird/"">Andrew Bird</a> collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1180-dosh/"">Martin Dosh</a>’s conservatory-school post-rock solo work. Even in Zammuto’s and his former band’s most uninspired moments, their music sounded like little else out there. By comparison, <i>Anchor</i> goes as far to feature a cover of sorts, unheard of in Zammuto’s little corner of the world—specifically, a rendition of the traditional folk song ""Henry Lee"", which has been <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhW06rqc8rA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covered before and with greater success</a>. Zammuto’s take is static and muted, with a small cinematic wash providing the tune’s only source of tension.</p>
<p><i>Anchor</i>’s quiet, indifferent drift is disappointing, but the album’s biggest misstep, paradoxically, is also its boldest cut: ""IO"", which pairs flatulent bass with a swaggering vocal performance from Zammuto and a drum beat befitting Eddie Money. The brief entrance of stiff, obtrusive strings underlines its inherent off-putting qualities, and even though it appears on a record that could use some thrilling moments, “IO” is the wrong type of disruption. Still, even though <i>Anchor</i> is a truly disappointing work from such an inventive mind, it’s not enough to suggest that he’s reached the point of creative bankruptcy. Perhaps it’s best to think of <i>Anchor</i> as more catapult fodder, another artifact to be launched into the air and destroyed in search of a fresh start.</p></div>"|19766.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19766-zammuto-anchor/|5.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

That's ironic, because in his two decades as a solo artist, he's recorded gritty acid fugues, limpid deep house, knotty breakbeat hardcore, and clean-lined minimal techno, among other styles, both pure and hybrid. His cheeky 2004 single ""Geht's Noch?"" was an unwitting midwife to a squawking strain of big-room EDM; the following year, he teamed up with the vibraphonist Christopher Dell for <i>Superstructure</i>, a collection of diffuse, freeform techno-jazz. (For most club music producers, a release like the latter would be the outlier in his or her catalog, but in Flügel's case, it's the populist, over-the-top club jam that remains the exception.)</p>
<p class=""p1"">But Flügel's signature remains legible in pretty much whatever he does, despite the stylistic diversity of his catalog. (That range is one reason he's used so many aliases over the years, including Roman IV, Soylent Green, ro70, and Eight Miles High, in addition to his and Jörn Elling Wuttke's shifting collective identity as Alter Ego, Acid Jesus, Holy Garage, et al.) He's got a way with rippling, wriggling drum patterns, and his knack for daubing on tonal elements proves him to be a skilled pointillist. His ear for nuance and his feel for balance let him take the most shopworn sounds—an unadorned drum machine, a crackling breakbeat, a wily TB-303—and make them sound, if not exactly new, indisputably <i>his</i>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That's truer than ever on <i>Happiness Is Happening</i>, which builds on the principles he set out in 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15983-fatty-folders/""><i>Fatty Folders</i></a> in playful and sometimes surprising ways. Reflecting a newfound sense of focus in his work, the latter was his first album released under his own name; the new one widens its scope without forsaking any of its cohesion. At its core, the record foregrounds a strain of house music that's wispy but wiry, favoring all his usual trademarks: scratchy analog drum machines, lush pads, quirky little quasi-melodies, and glassy FM synthesizers with the sour clang of oil-drums half-submerged in water.</p>
<p class=""p1"">A few of the tracks easily could have fit on <i>Fatty Folders</i> or any of the club-oriented EPs he's released between then and now on labels like <a href=""http://www.dial-rec.de/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dial</a> and <a href=""http://liveatrobertjohnson.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Live at Robert Johnson</a>. ""Stuffy"", sounding anything but, is classic Flügel: a percussive, energetic workout marked by brittle drums and a colorful, pinging melody. The expressive way that the track's cymbals twitch and flare confirm him as one of our most talented hi-hat programmers. ""Your War Is Over"" plays with similar ideas, as kalimba-inspired synthesizers pluck against watery chords; though nominally four-to-the-floor, the kick drum is little more than a shadow of itself, which aids the track's weightless drift. ""We Have a Nice Life"" plays with dance-floor convention in similar ways, opening with two minutes of beatless drones before pulling itself up by its bootstraps—well, its arpeggios, anyway—and morphing into a jaunty set of variations on an Italo-house theme, all whispery shakers and laser zaps. (There are only about four elements in play, yet no two bars of the song are the same, proof of Flügel's commitment to composition as a process of perpetual mutation.) And the slower ""Tense Times"" stretches those same Italo influences, like rubbery bass arpeggios and rich, major chords, into a dubby fantasia that sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3169-the-orb/"">the Orb</a> gone disco. It's muscular but dreamy, the kind of contradiction that Flügel savors.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But a goodly portion of <i>Happiness Is Happening </i>finds Flügel stretching out and trying out new styles—or styles new to his catalog, anyway.  The delightful ""Friendship Song"" borrows the chord changes from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"">Grimes</a>' ""Oblivion"" and turns it into a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"">Depeche Mode</a> song circa <i>Speak &amp; Spell</i>, and ""Wilkie"", similarly springy and similarly naïve, strikes up a dialogue with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"">New Order</a> of <i>Power, Corruption &amp; Lies</i>. (That might sound to you like a wholly unnecessary exercise, but once you hear the way he handles the subject matter—gentle but authoritative, and also a little awestruck—you will agree that it is not.) ""Parade"" twists up the canon yet again, this time by fusing the snap and crackle of early '80s electro with the apocalyptic klaxon blasts of early '90s rave music, like a hybrid of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2352-kraftwerk"">Kraftwerk</a>'s ""Numbers"" and Second Phase's ""Mentasm.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Two songs in particular show what a versatile producer he can be.  The opening ""Connecting the Ghost"" explores a slow-fast ""motorik"" pulse, its stately, chugging beat a foil for Flügel to indulge in creamy textures and squealing oscillators; the quick-stepping ""Occult Levitation"" offers little more than a steady patter of lawn-sprinkler hi-hats and rosy sunrise glow. Both, in their way, are genre studies—Krautrock and techno, respectively—but more than that, they're examples of Flügel's unique sensibility, deft touch, and expressive, unmistakable voice. </p></div>"|19618.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19618-roman-flugel-happiness-is-happening/|8.1|Philip Sherburne

In the 13 years since Anthony Gonzalez and then-collaborator Nicolas Fromageau released the project’s first, self-titled record, the kind of big tent, feelings-forward electro-rock hybrid that they made has become, in some permutation, the base stock of most popular indie acts. While <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine"">My Bloody Valentine</a> were—and remain—a good point of reference for M83’s sonic textures, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"">Arcade Fire</a> are perhaps a better touchpoint for their overall approach: lead with emotions telegraphed big and wide enough to fill a stadium, and let the guitars and synthesizers fall into place around them.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This trilogy of reissues beautifully tracks the evolution of Gonzalez’s work from student film, to limited-release, to blockbuster. It also marks a very clear progression from an accessible, emotional electronic music project to what Brandon Stosuy aptly described as “high-concept emo embossed with glittery snow angels.” The story of these three records is not that of Gonzalez filling his music with progressively more embellishment, but rather of Gonzalez learning how to reorganize the core of his musical vision </span><span>around</span><span> that embellishment. The glass baubles of </span><i>M83</i><span> became the rhinestone earrings of </span><i>Dead Cities, Red Seas &amp; Lost Ghosts, </i>which<span> became the crystal chandeliers of </span><i>Before the Dawn Heals Us</i><span>.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Sure enough, M83’s self-titled debut album is their stateliest and most deliberate work. The album’s song titles point further towards an emo narrative, but the music itself only hints at this kind of heavy-handed heartstring-tugging; for better or worse, this is M83 introducing themselves as an electronic project with strong emotional undercurrents, and not much deeper than that.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Dead Cities, Red Seas &amp; Lost Ghosts </i>is<span> a transitional record that bridges the gap between M83’s relatively understated beginnings and their bombastic recent output. Listening back 11 years later, it’s notable how </span><span>messy </span><i>Dead Cities </i><span>is; though </span><span>it</span><span> still operates in something that resembles an electronic music paradigm, much of its energy is crowded into the upper-midrange frequencies that usually pile up when layering distorted electric guitars. A synthesizer-heavy crescendo is often followed by a bigger, heavier crescendo, with more sounds and ideas piled on even if there isn’t really room for them. </span><i>Dead Cities</i><span> makes its case through sheer scale and force of will, constantly running up against the limitations of its own construction. It's dramatic music embroiled in its own internal drama, and it succeeds on slightly different terms from any subsequent M83 record.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Nowhere is this particular formula better articulated than “Run Into Flowers”, the debut single from </span><i>Dead Cities</i><span> and one of the most achingly, </span><span>incessantly</span><span> beautiful songs Gonzalez has ever released. It layers buzzing synthesizers, dramatic synthesized strings, humming synthesizers, gently sung vocals, and even <i>more</i> synthesizers to create a vast, overpowering swell that starts big and only seems to grow bigger. “0078h” builds to a dizzying crescendo, as beats collapse over themselves and synthesized voices ping-pong unintelligibly like a computer struggling with its own sentience. Even the bleepy and bloopy “Cyborg” builds to a satisfyingly organic conclusion that honors its part-human, part-robot namesake.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>And indeed, it’s that </span><span>human</span><span> element, in the form of the human voice, that comes to greater prominence post-</span><i>Dead Cities</i><span>. </span><i>Before the Dawn Heals Us</i><span> marks a number of notable changes from its predecessor, including the departure of Fromageau and the reworking of the M83’s aesthetic from tasteful electronic minimalism to broad-stroke ""</span><span>Miami Vice""</span><span> expressionism. To whatever extent </span><i>Dead Cities</i><span> seemed corny when compared to other </span><span>electronic</span><span> albums, </span><i>Before the Dawn Heals Us</i><span> is corny and overstated by nearly any measure. But on </span><i>Before the Dawn Heals Us</i><span>, Gonzalez actually makes </span><span>room</span><span> for all the bombast of his songs. The single “Don’t Save Us From the Flames” finds Gonzalez embracing not just the energy of rock music, but also its dynamics. The drums—or, rather, “drums”—protrude forcefully, rather than getting swallowed up in synthesizers and static. There's a clear and appreciable distinction between lead synths and synth pads.

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Sure enough, the remixes included in the bonus EPs are instructive primarily because they tease out these individual elements, lay them out in a more linear fashion, and give them room to express themselves in a less frantic and busy context. One gets the sense that, when presented sequentially, each of the instrumental tracks in a single M83 song could fill up an entire record. The B-sides included here fall predictably short, largely because they seem to lack the over-the-top commitment of their album counterparts. These songs are, for sure, host to their own subtle charms—but subtlety is not Gonzalez’s strong suit, nor is it what this kind of music calls for. M83's records certainly don’t fall apart under close scrutiny, and they don’t ask for such scrutiny, either. Instead, they ask that you suspend just a little bit of critical disbelief, and let yourself get carried away.</span></p></div>"|19775.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19775-m83-m83-dead-cities-red-seas-lost-ghosts-before-the-dawn-heals-us-dead-cities-red-seas-and-lost-ghosts-remixes-b-sides-ep-before-the-dawn-heals-us-remixes-b-sides-ep/|6.0|Matt LeMay

He had been headed for the Air Force, but a tragic accident with a friend's gun, which Makonnen described in heartbreaking detail to <a href=""http://www.buzzfeed.com/naomizeichner/who-is-ilovemakonnen#1vs5bsc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BuzzFeed</a>, ended with his friend dead in a car shortly after their high school graduation. Sheran, who was in the car, was implicated, and his life's direction changed.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">He spent his resultant exile trawling MySpace and broadening his musical tastes—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2368-the-killers"">the Killers</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/571-bloc-party/"">Bloc Party</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29473-adele/"">Adele</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"">Lil B</a>, whom he enthusiastically interviewed on his <a href=""http://ilovemakonnen.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a>. He also posted rough cuts of his songs, which fumbled ecstatically toward some synth-heavy fusion of all of them. Some were raw, unformed blobs, but there were hints of an aesthetic moving beneath. He reached out to everyone he admired and began quietly laying the groundwork for his career.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">All this context is already old news—at least, since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17041-ilovemakonnen-club-goin-up-on-a-tuesday-ft-drake/"">cleared his throat</a> and launched Makonnen's career into the stratosphere. His latest release, the i<i>LoveMakonnen</i> EP, features production from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32198-metro-boomin/"">Metro Boomin</a> and Sonny Digital. He's at the center of the rap conversation, but he also represents the most recent goal post in the ongoing expansion of what a rapper can be.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Makonnen's relationship to rap is intriguing. He dips briefly into signifiers of the street—the juug, the plug, coke, Molly and lean—and throws together some bars on ""I Don't Sell Molly No More"". But mostly, he sings, and he does so in a rich, untrained, wobbly voice, with an expressive tenderness unheard of even in a rap world with Drake at its center. (When Drake hopped on Makonnen's ""Club Goin Up on a Tuesday,"" he had to adopt an even-softer voice than usual.) ""I wasn't trying to be no hip-hop,"" Makonnen told BuzzFeed, describing the development of his sound. ""I didn't give a fuck about drums. But I knew what to do to get the looks I wanted to get.""</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>The fourth song on the <i>i</i><i>LoveMakonnen</i> EP, ""Tonight"", is an airy, strobing house song, with a hip-tugging syncopated bass line and diaphanous layers of synths floating above like hand scarves. Makonnen's melodies have a theatrical swoop to them; ""Sarah"" has the arc and fever pitch of a Broadway power ballad, and on ""Too Much"", he lets his voice dip into a Nate Dogg-y basso profundo before leaping into a startlingly unvarnished higher register, his voice shaking and nearly cracking.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The mood of the EP is primarily lovelorn and wistful, with a series of songs directly addressing the girls in his life. Each of them gets named directly—Brianna, Shoshanna, Sarah—and it's hard not to attribute this behavior to Drake, who made all his long-gone exes famous. Drake probably leapt on ""Tuesday"" because he heard a burgeoning star bearing his direct influence, and he likely signed him directly to his OVO imprint for the same reason—as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2173-jay-z/"">Jay Z</a> said in the 2000 concert film <i>Backstage</i>, when you find your successor, you sign him.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">When Makonnen raps, as on ""I Don't Sell Molly No More"", he sounds nothing like Drake. There is something loose and bemused in his voice: This isn't really what I do, his vocal tone says, but hey, I'll give it a whirl anyway. There are echoes of his favorite rappers, people like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane"">Gucci Mane</a> and the all-important BasedGod, in his cadences and patterns, but the song itself is a prop, a chance to try out some juicy-sounding words. Makonnen's music fairly beams at you with this self-satisfied serenity: even his songs about selling drugs have the weightlessness of a stage full of paper-mache props.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-159f1e94-36b6-1785-76b8-032d3cd02777""> This might sound like a criticism, but that play-acted feeling is one of the most satisfying parts of Makonnen's world. Like Atlanta's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30068-future/"">previous</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30587-young-thug/"">two</a> rap breakouts, Makonnen has used his unique talents to build a reality-distortion bubble, a place where rap's rules slide off the sides. That bubble swelled to a big enough size that we get to pass through and explore it, and watch rap giants try to contend with it. </span></p></div>"|19774.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19774-ilovemakonnen-ilovemakonnen-ep/|8.0|Jayson Greene

These days, metal’s gnarled family tree has blossomed into a dizzying number of subgenres, but almost all of it comes back to doom, regardless of tempo or texture. Doom may center itself around stoned stupor, Satanic camp, and sick riffage, but it also possesses a meditative musical mode buried deep inside it, a glassy-eyed glance into life’s grimmest mysteries.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Earlier this summer, Arkansas's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30107-pallbearer/"" target=""_blank"">Pallbearer</a> provided a winning example of this approach with their esoteric, genre-ignorant <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19570-pallbearer-foundations-of-burden/"">Foundations of Burden</a>, </i>and<i> </i>now the always-crushing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4719-yob/"" target=""_blank"">YOB</a> have returned with a similarly-striving epic called <i>Clearing the Path to Ascend. </i>With seven excellent albums and over a decade of experience under their belt, the esteemed Oregon outfit have long since established themselves as one of the most progressive acts of their generation. Psychedelic rock, stoner rock, stoner metal, blues metal, ambient: all reside comfortably in YOB’s wheelhouse, coalescing and collapsing on a path that stretches as far as the listener’s imagination. The band's most recent effort, 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15724-atma/"" target=""_blank""><i>Atma</i></a>, took its inspiration from the Eastern concept of “the higher self”—a theme they fleshed out with droning, circular mantras and monolithic instrumentation. YOB take similarly transcendent strides on <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19570-pallbearer-foundations-of-burden/"" target=""_blank"">Clearing the Path to Ascend</a>, </i>reshaping the traditionally-forlorn moans and groans of doom into an amorphous roar that, however hellish, shimmers with something resembling hope.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As is typical with YOB (and doom in general), enlightenment doesn’t come easy. <i>Clearing the Path to Ascend </i>contains only four tracks, each surpassing the ten-minute mark and the heaviness of a black hole. On opener “In Our Blood"", philosopher Alan Watts offers some soothing instructions—“Time to wake up”—before gingerly stepping aside for a rude awakening: Mike Scheidt’s banshee-like wail, accompanied by swooping, sullen guitars. Bassist Aaron Rieseberg and drummer Travis Foster handle the majority of the heavy lifting, but it’s Scheidt’s singing that drives the band’s metamorphic energy. He’s not a singer so much as he’s a shaman, using his diverse range of grotesque death growls and plaintive melodies to toy with the listener’s preconceptions, especially where identity is concerned.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Such is the queasy fun of ""In Our Blood"", Scheidt's sixteen-minute trip to hell and back. His thin, feeble tenor coasts along smoothly for the first several minutes, but before long, something wicked reaches beyond the void and snatches up the melody, leaving in its place the sound of utter ruin. Scheidt's chameleonic vocals present the band with an ever-replenishing resource from which they derive some of the album's most lasting material: the unfurling, feminine ""Unmask the Spectre"", which is situated alongside ""Marrow"", the album's defiant death knell of a closer.</p>
<p class=""p1"">YOB’s latest record stands as one of their densest, so it's good that the band's greatest asset, their impeccable pacing, remains intact. “Unmask the Spectre” plays out as a masterclass in dramatic tension, its punishing core buffered on both sides by moody, barren sludge. At last, Scheidt finally unleashes his thunderous yell, a solo nipping at its heels—and before long, he's whispering again, dragging everything back into the gloaming. The power of darkness depends on contrast, so by spacing out their otherworldly confrontations, the Oregonians ensure that the true path lay ever in sight.</p></div>"|19617.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19617-yob-clearing-the-path-to-ascend/|8.2|Zoe Camp

When the Sudanese sometimes-session musician started on his own as Sinkane, his work resembled the rustling, windswept breeze of post-rock—2008 debut <i>Color Voice</i> and the following year’s self-titled effort could’ve been easily mistaken for the sprawling instrumental work coming out of Chicago in the late ‘90s. But as he vacuumed up more sonic influences, the music contracted. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17218-mars/""><i>Mars</i></a> from 2012, Sinkane’s breakout effort, was an appealing mix of Afropop rhythms and dance music’s slinkier tendencies, as Gallab restrained his leg-stretching tendencies with pop-focused structures that nonetheless possessed a jammy feel. His latest, <i>Mean Love</i>, is his most direct and concise collection of songs yet, distilling his compositional talents and reining in any attendant looseness.</p>
<p>This overall trajectory isn’t dissimilar to that of the band he’s most known for contributing to, Brooklyn aesthetes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5506-yeasayer/"">Yeasayer</a>, who made a name with distinctly proggy, expansive-sounding music before whittling down their rougher edges. But while Yeasayer have experienced a creative decline in their search for a simpler expression, Gallab continues to improve his sense of songcraft. Earlier this year, he acted as musical director for <i>ATOMIC BOMB! The Music of William Onyeabor</i>, a celebration of the Nigerian synth-pop pioneer that included contributions from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"">David Byrne</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32338-devonte-hynes/"">Devonté Hynes</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2053-hot-chip/"">Hot Chip</a>’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7725-alexis-taylor/"">Alexis Taylor</a>, among others. On <i>Mean Love</i>, Gallab exudes a similar sense of adventurousness, and he liberally wields Afropop influences with confidence; the cascading horns and easy, continuous beat of “New Name” resemble the hypnotic ebullience of luminaries like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6152-tony-allen/"">Tony Allen</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2346-fela-kuti/"">Fela Kuti</a> poured into a small-scale mold.</p>
<p>Showcasing a stylistic restlessness that works in Gallab’s favor, <i>Mean Love</i>’s try-anything spirit is sometimes reminiscent of the electro-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28039-toro-y-moi/"">Toro Y Moi</a>’s Chaz Bundick, with Gallab’s smooth professionalism replacing Bundick’s good-natured amateurishness. More favorably, Gallab’s pleasing upper vocal register and genre-bending tendencies recall Dan Snaith, the mastermind behind the influence-inhaling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/"">Caribou</a> project (Gallab was a live drummer for Caribou for a time) who’s proved a master in creating pop music that’s emotive, brainy, and brawny. Snaith’s airy voice tends to float over the music, and Gallab similarly hovers over the slow drumbeat and jettisoned synths of “Son”, the album’s lyrical high point. ""Son"" finds its creator ruminating on familial pressures and the eternal conundrum of finding a place within one’s point of geographical origin: “There’s a pressure to being your eldest/ There’s such pressure to make you the proudest...I will not forget where I came from.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Gallab tackles slow-moving funk, spaced-out psychedelic pop, and peppy tropicalia with confidence. His creative malleability is impressive, even if the results don’t always excite; in particular, a few cuts on the album’s back half (the languid title track, “Galley Boys”, the twangy closer “Omdurman”) take on countrified shapes with brushes of slide guitar, a stylistic turn that is structurally sound but not as engaging as <i>Mean Love</i>’s other genre excursions. It seems almost unfair, though, to criticize Gallab for the minor crime of engaging with a sound that’s not as inherently interesting as what he’s proven capable of elsewhere, as <i>Mean Love</i> cements his reputation as a capable musical wanderer willing to engage with a variety of sounds. </p></div>"|19715.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19715-sinkane-mean-love/|7.2|Larry Fitzmaurice

Sophisticated, precocious, cerebral, and self-aware enough to playfully poke at its own pretensions, college rock played a key role in the evolution of '70s post-punk into '90s alternative—a path that Michael Azerrad only touches on in his parallel, punk-heavy chronicle of the '80s American rock underground, <i>Our Band Could Be Your Life</i>. Above all else, college rock was an archly clever form of guitar pop, the kind that found a home on college radio stations in the '80s. It had no qualms about fostering wider ambitions, though; it didn’t need to directly address the college experience, let alone be played by college students. Yet the entire, decade-long lifespan of college rock can be neatly bookended by two songs penned by college-spawned bands, and that even reference specific schools by name. The later of the two is “U-Mass”, released in 1991 by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3324-pixies/"">Pixies</a>; the earlier one is “Bad Year at UCLA”, released in 1982 by Game Theory. </p>
<p>Game Theory may be the quintessence of '80s college rock, but the band is synonymous with Scott Miller. The singer-songwriter—who <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/50392-rip-scott-miller-of-game-theory-the-loud-family/"">died in 2013</a> at the age of 53 and was the group’s only constant member throughout its eight-year existence—formed the band in 1982 as a reassembly of his prior outfit, Alternate Learning. <i>Blaze of Glory</i>, Game Theory’s debut album, came out the same year. In the wake of Miller’s death, it’s being given a deluxe, expanded reissue, an extravagant treatment for a record that was recorded in Miller’s old bedroom at his parents’ house in Sacramento not long after he finished his studies at nearby UC Davis. Alternate Learning was his college band, and their two releases—1979’s <i>ALRN</i> EP and 1981 <i>Painted Windows </i>full-length—created a template not only for Game Theory, but for much of college rock to follow. The name Alternate Learning even <i>sounds</i> like the missing link between alternative rock and college rock.</p>
<p>Four selections from <i>ALRN </i>and <i>Painted Windows</i> appear among the fifteen bonus tracks on the <i>Blaze of Glory</i> reissue, and they’re a potential-rich premonition of what would come; <i>Painted Windows</i>’ “Another Wasted Afternoon” is baroque on a budget, a wannabe <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22319-the-left-banke/"">Left Banke</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4746-the-zombies/"">Zombies</a> daydream strained through post-punk starkness and denuded of ornamentation—unless you count frantic polyrhythmic drumming and ice-rink organ fills as frilliness. And ALRN’s “What’s the Matter” is as close to punk rock as Miller ever came, a distorted rush of sunny melody that feels like a beach-party Buzzcocks. </p>
<p>Alternate Learning’s cocky innocence holds up wonderfully, but Game Theory served as Miller’s graduate program in pop songcraft. While at UC Davis, he’d bunked with a fellow aspiring songwriter, Steve Wynn, who moved to Los Angeles and formed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14912-the-dream-syndicate/"">the Dream Syndicate</a> in 1981. But where the Dream Syndicate (and the Paisley Underground movement that sprouted up around it) updated West Coast psychedelia for a post-punk world, Game Theory rolled itself out on new-wave training wheels. As opposed to Alternate Learning, who deserve to be ranked just below <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5948-the-feelies/"">the Feelies</a> in the jittery-nerd pantheon of the American post-punk era, Game Theory branch into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7758-devo/"">Devo</a>-esque, back-’n’-forth jerkin’ on “White Blues”; that engagement with the new wave zeitgeist circa 1982 goes deeper on “The Young Drug”, whose keyboard-clipped angularity and furtive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">Beatles</a> worship echoes what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4685-xtc/"">XTC</a> was up to at the time. “It’s not 1962”, Miller yelps on “The Young Drug”, and it might as well be a psychedelic manifesto for the skinny-tie set.</p>
<p>While never as kaleidoscopic as his Paisley Underground counterparts, Miller spikes <i>Blaze of Glory</i> with one of his most flagrantly trippy compositions, “Stupid Heart”, a venom-dripping, flange-smeared odyssey of romantic dystopia. Nothing screams “my college years” like petulantly bitter love songs, and Miller goes on obliging. On “All I Want Is Everything”—as peppy as ALRN’s “What’s the Matter”, only minus the pseudo-punk fuzz—Miller sings, “Don’t ask me why/ I get so happy” as he spits the ironies and paradoxes of attraction into Cupid’s teeth.</p>
<p>“Sleeping Through Heaven” is <i>Blaze of Glory</i>’s keenest glimpse into Miller’s inner workings. He named Game Theory after the mathematical analysis of conflict, decision, and logical strategies—Miller himself wound up working in computer engineering—and the lyrics to “Sleeping Through Heaven” lean heavily toward that titular theme. “I will play the deck no matter how much it’s stacked,” he sings with wispy, soaring melancholy, before delivering an anthem-worthy slogan: “I want to go bang on every door/ And say, ‘Wake up, you’re sleeping through heaven.’” There’s an underlying lushness to its otherwise Spartan, synth-braced structure— a flowering around the edges that recalls contemporaries like the Psychedelic Furs, although Miller himself more closely resembles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1956-robyn-hitchcock/"">Robyn Hitchcock</a> in all his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16147-the-soft-boys/"">Soft Boys</a> glory. He goes on to add, “Maybe I’m too dumb to stay depressed”. Miller’s lyrics are as subtle, self-negating, and quixotically triumphant as his flippantly complex chords and melodies. Post-collegiate ennui might be the most privileged state of existential angst imaginable, but Miller milks that First World problem for all the pathos it’s worth. As Franklin Bruno writes in “Blaze of GI—: Scott Miller: An Appreciation” from <i>The Pitchfork Review</i> #2, “‘Sleeping Through Heaven’ knows what it wants to say, and enough about how it needs to be shaped to put the point across.” More than anything, that emerging confidence in the face of the gaping chasm of the future is what makes <i>Blaze of Glory</i> so exhilarating.</p>
<p>But it’s “Bad Year at UCLA” that emblemizes <i>Blaze of Glory</i>. The song is iterated three times on this reissue: there's the album version, a charmingly rickety live version, and a thirty-second acoustic reprise that’s more of a crosshatched sketch. Combined, they flesh out the full range of Miller’s vision at Game Theory’s outset: from singer/songwriter idleness to twitchy new-wave populism, “Bad Year at UCLA” combines Miller’s various ambitions into a single, vivid document. “You’re wondering if pain so beautiful/ Should earn a happy ending,” he bleats, his voice boyish and vaporous.</p>
<p>Game Theory are often pegged as power pop, but that genre, as great as it can be, is comparatively junior high to Miller’s post-grad ruminations on purpose, destiny, and the vicissitudes of lust. <i>Blaze of Glory</i>’s title sardonically hints at some kind of fatalism, as if the album might have been Miller’s first and last real stab at immortality. Illustrating his own contradictory nature, he packaged some of the original copies of the LP in a trash bag. Instead of being a desperate one-shot, though, <i>Blaze of Glory</i> wound up as an inspired beginning.</p></div>"|19679.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19679-game-theory-blaze-of-glory/|7.2|Jason Heller

Since when have Blonde Redhead been so literal? Since 2010’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14609-penny-sparkle/""><i>Penny Sparkle</i></a>, if we’re being honest, a lackluster album that traded in the trio’s lush, fathomless mystique for little more than a cellophane wisp of no-calorie beauty. It sparkled, and that was about it. Four years have passed since then, and while it may be perfectly reasonable to expect the group responsible for entrancing albums like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/804-melody-of-certain-damaged-lemons/""><i>Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons</i></a> to return to form at some point, that point is not reached on <i>Barragán.</i> </p>
<p>Calling <i>Barragán</i> halfhearted would be giving it too much credit, both effort-wise and emotion-wise: it’s a cold fish of a record, dead-eyed and clammy. Singer/guitarist <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazu_Makino"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Kazu Makino"">Kazu Makino</a> has always kept her voice solemn and controlled, but the sense that there's something vast being held behind that mask is gone. ""The One I Love” is about as compelling as tears plopping into a bucket, a hollow exercise in vague, impressionistic storytelling set to an limp art-pop track of acoustic guitars and flutes. “She does nothing all day/ But sit down and cry,” Makino chants like a bored chorister. The ennui is so on-the-nose, it’s oppressive.</p>
<p>The album is stubbornly unassertive. “No More Honey” is the closest <i>Barragán</i> comes<i> </i>to featuring a flesh-and-blood song, but lead guitarist Amedeo Pace’s swells of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a>-like riffage are kept on a short leash, then quickly shooed away. Ambient noises are sprinkled throughout—birds, what sounds like a typewriter, echoes of echoes with no discernable source—but they serve no purpose other than punctuating the emptiness of the music surrounding them. It’s a recurring theme, but one without a point—unless, as with the shuffling, exhausted-by-its-own-existence “Penultimo”, Blonde Redhead are trying to write songs that are featherweight and leaden at the same time. </p>
<p>Blonde Redhead began dabbling in electronic sounds on 1998’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vULh0SXuQ58"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Missile + +”</a>, and they go down a similar path on two <i>Barragán</i> tracks, “Dripping” and “Mind to Be Had”. Neither use those icy pulses to decent effect; the former teases with glimpses of ghostly melody without fully coming into focus, and the latter is a nine-minute slog of ping-ponged monotone. “Defeatist Anthem” sums it up best: Makino coos and sighs expectantly, and for a second, it seems like something—<i>anything</i>—might take flight. Then it just squirms in a circle of listless prettiness. “We wanted to make something timeless and pure, and perhaps a little minimalist too,” drummer/singer Simone Pace recently said in an <a href=""http://www.thestar.com.my/Lifestyle/Entertainment/Music/News/2014/06/12/NYC-indie-rock-act-Blonde-Redhead-debuts-new-tunes-in-Singapore/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a>. Instead of timeless, though, <i>Barrágan </i>is static; instead of pure, it’s blank; instead of minimalist, it’s stingy.</p>
<p>This year marks the 20th anniversary of Blonde Redhead’s second single, “Vague”/<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZgUKLjvW7Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Jetstar”</a>, their first for Steve Shelley’s Smells Like Records imprint. Accordingly, the single sounded a lot like Sonic Youth, from its soft, discordant buildup to its cyber-psychedelic climax. The band went on to master that nervy dynamic, and many others, during their late '90s/early '00s peak. They effortlessly recontextualized avant-rock, electro-pop, shoegaze, and white noise. Their back catalog is a deep well of potential to draw from, and it's enough to make you wish that <i>Penny Sparkle</i> had only been a fluke. Four years later, though, all Blonde Redhead has to show for its lengthy studio hiatus is another too-obvious bauble.</p></div>"|19760.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19760-blonde-redhead-barragan/|4.3|Jason Heller

Though the sound of his full-length debut <i>Indigo Child</i> is tough to pin down, listening to his music easily conjures comparison to beloved acts of this generation: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6335-andre-3000/"">André 3000</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8562-kid-cudi/"">Kid Cudi</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Ocean</a>. He is reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31696-lorde/"" target=""_blank"">Lorde</a>, another teenage shuffling disparate interests—rap, folk, EDM—into something logical. And like Lorde, Raury has a nose for the sky-scraping moment and knows how to make a big song seem personal. If you had to bet on an artist-on-the-verge becoming a big star, there are worse bets.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 24px;""><i>I</i><i>ndigo Child</i> serves as a perfect introduction to Raury’s style-sampling aesthetic, as well as the blizzard of sometimes-undercooked ideas he brings to the table. On “Superfly”, he borrows liberally from the melody of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8562-kid-cudi/"">Kid Cudi</a>’s “Day 'n' Nite”, switching from rapping to reaching for the heavens with a soulful breakdown. “God’s Whisper” aims unabashedly for an exultant campfire singalong and mostly nails it; “Wildfire” is a string-laden track resembling something a teenage <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6335-andre-3000/"">André 3000</a> would have made if he had never met <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7749-big-boi/"">Big Boi</a>, steering Raury into a trance-like climax where he paraphrases <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne"">Lil Wayne</a>’s “The Block Is Hot”. Though the ideas come from a variety of points existing on the pop music spectrum, Raury’s warm production helps <i>Indigo Child </i>achieve a general coherence, a testament to his ability to organize the swirling nature of his sound.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><i>Indigo Child</i> shows all the hallmarks of promise, but the music doesn't always live up to the prevailing comparisons that have been thrust upon the teenager. Though many of Raury’s ideas are strong and linked together in interesting ways, sometimes he doesn't quite hit his mark. Album closer “Seven Suns” is an eight-minute, staring-at-the-sun style melter that feels gratuitous, while the record's other large-sized, orchestrated moments feel a little hollow (""Chariots of Fire"") with lyrics that take on the form of of empty teenage philosophizing (“I shared my cigarette with her/ I fucked her every Wednesday evening/ Why do you always use that word/ When you don't even know its meaning?”). Overall, <i>Indigo Child </i>is an intriguing blueprint for Raury's talent, and watching Raury continue to put it all together going forward will definitely prove fascinating. </p></div>"|19790.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19790-raury-indigo-child/|6.5|Corban Goble

He would browse the endless racks of VHS boxes, especially curious about the fantastical illustrations that lined the horror and science fiction sections. His mother and father (a cinematographer and director whose most famous credits are <i>Rambo: First Blood Part II </i>and <i>Tombstone</i>) wouldn’t let him watch scary movies, but as Cosmatos told <i>Filmmaker Magazine</i>, he would “spend hours looking at the box covers… just imagining my own versions of them.” Decades later, those made-up stories would eventually coalesce into his first feature-length film, 2010’s <i><a href=""http://youtu.be/Q1ertVYn750"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beyond the Black Rainbow</a></i>, a mesmerizing period-piece headtrip sci-fi horror thriller that inevitably became a cult favorite.</p>
<p>As origin stories go, that’s a good one. And it’s borne out by the film itself, which borrows liberally from the past but proves less specifically referential than, say, any Tarantino flick. On first viewing <i>Beyond the Black Rainbow</i> seems visually arresting yet thematically vacuous: The story crawls, yet (or because) each frame is meticulously composed and shot. There’s a strange doctor treating a young woman who is so sedated she can barely speak and whose long, black hair obscures her face to give her the appearance of a j-horror wraith. There’s the suspicious Arboria Institute, straight out of a Cronenberg flick; there are red stormtroopers called sentionauts, two doomed heshers, and the coolest Lotus Esprit since <i>The Spy Who Loved Me</i>. On repeated viewings, however, all of these fantastical elements begin to push forward certain themes—generally, an older generation preying on a younger one. More specifically, it seems to locate the roots of the present generation’s addiction to mood-altering drugs in the Baby Boomer’s pursuit of enlightenment through mind-altering hallucinogens.</p>
<p>Because the film delivers so much of its information visually rather than through expository dialogue—a trick more filmmakers should try—the music must be both bold and nonintrusive, gingerly reinforcing the imaginary 1983 milieu without rendering it as novelty. Working under his Sinoia Caves alias, Jeremy Schmidt has crafted a soundtrack that nods to the early VHS era but is never too specific in its nostalgia; this is music made to tell a story, or at least part of one. Schmidt, a member of the Canadian indie-prog outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/584-black-mountain/"">Black Mountain</a>, knows this territory well: In 2002 he released his Sinoia Caves debut, <i>The Enchanter Persuaded</i>, which expertly mixed cosmic synths and <i>kosmische</i> sequencers. Schmidt took a few years to subtly and meticulously rearrange the major suites from his <i>Black Rainbow</i> score into a work that alludes to the movie but should work for people who’ve never even heard of Panos Cosmatos. In doing so, he has done what neither <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14938-tron-legacy-ost/"">Daft Punk</a> nor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18022-m83-oblivion-ost/"">M83</a> could pull off: He has created a soundtrack that works as an imaginative and often moving standalone album.</p>
<p>Just as Cosmatos drew from his own memory to craft the movie, Schmidt seems to have composed this music based on hazy memories of old soundtracks. There are sly nods to <a href=""http://youtu.be/nQWqRGVE1Zk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Carpenter</a> and <a href=""http://youtu.be/vzU3jnNWKbI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Goblin</a>, <a href=""http://youtu.be/GQDU-2qMre0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jan Hammer</a> and <a href=""http://vimeo.com/94691440"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jon McCallum</a>. He uses voices well, an old trope that horror flicks have used to imply some ritualistic terror but here sounds more benign—as though Schmidt is peopling Cosmatos’ often empty frames. On opener “Forever Dilating Eye”, a bodiless choir sings the wordless theme, then fades into a quick pulse of dwindling syllables. The effect is that of humans being broadcast via unreliable technology. Those strange vocals reappear at times throughout the album, until they are finally answered by a mechanistic monotone from the movie about better living through chemistry. </p>
<p>“Elena’s Sound-World” recalls <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2950-giorgio-moroder/"">Giorgio Moroder</a>’s work for <a href=""http://youtu.be/WK977rQKHOo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oliver Stone</a>, but what’s more impressive is how sympathetic the song is toward the title character, imprisoned in the weird Arboria Institute. The pulsing sequencers and bodiless choir of voices not only sound startlingly tender (echoing the sensitivity with which Cosmatos finally shows her face), but the song grows larger with each measure, as though imagining a wide world beyond the confining walls. On the other hand, “Run Program: Sentionauts”, with its towering organ riffs and prismatic synthesizers, conveys nothing but danger and dread as it reimagines a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5820-popol-vuh/"">Popol Vuh</a> Herzog score as a teen slasher soundtrack.</p>
<p>In other words, this is music that tells a story—that, crucially, makes its own powerful statement—even when detached from <i>Beyond the Black Rainbow</i>. It ebbs and flows in dramatic arcs, from the fluttery hush of “Arboria Tapes – Award Winning Gardens” to the foreboding synths of “1983 – Main Titles.” The album builds as it proceeds, such that the errant drones and earth-rattling chords of the seventeen-minute “1966 – Let the New Age of Enlightenment Begin” supply rising action and the eerie prog bombast of closer “Sentionauts II” creates a climactic conclusion. In both the film and its soundtrack, there is a constant sense of opening out: Elena’s world grows larger and larger as she ventures from her cell into the wide world, while Schmidt’s score similarly sounds like it is forever dilating, at least until the last synthburst fades. </p></div>"|19753.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19753-sinoia-caves-beyond-the-black-rainbow-ost/|8.1|Stephen M.

The New York-based, Florida-born producer/singer who goes by Helado Negro doesn't remember who the other one is. Face-painted and serious, they both seem to be taking a moment out of one of those perfect childhood days to oblige a parent's request for a keepsake. The cover of Lange's fourth LP is a photo of a photograph that he found unexpectedly in his parent's house; its tears, curls, and age spots are captured in full as part of the composition. Fittingly, <i>Double Youth</i>, the boldest and most intricate Helado Negro work to date, grapples with memory and its uncanny tendency to wear away despite our best intentions to preserve it.</p>
<p><i>Double Youth</i> follows a trio of ambient, mood-based EPs, shifting emphasis to structure, motion, and beats. It's the first time that Lange's lyrics, which as always shift effortlessly between English and Spanish, aren't the most concrete feature in his music. Synth figures grind together like clockwork on ""It's Our Game"", which owes some of its playfulness to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5871-jimmy-tamborello"">Jimmy Tamborello</a>'s work with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"">the Postal Service</a> and as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1121-dntel/"">Dntel</a>. The bass line that tumbles through the song acts more as a counterpoint to Lange's phrasing than a part of the rhythm section, although the line between the beats and everything outside the beats here is a porous one. The 8/8 time signature becomes something for Lange to challenge, not submit to.<br/> <br/> Later, ""Myself On 2 U"" entertains a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a>-esque flutter while gulps of analog synths and backing soprano map out the chords. The menacing ""Triangulate"" rides a bristling industrial bass whose ascending phrases seem to leer at Lange's layered chants. ""We'll take our time/ And we'll crawl to you,"" he sings, as if extracting threats from the dissolving context of a dream. Throughout <i>Double Youth</i>, Lange's words follow dream logic rather than concrete narrative. He uses language not as a key to the album's core but as another texturizing element, rolling out commands that sound more natural in Spanish than they ever could in English: ""llamame"" (""call me""), ""dejame"" (""let me go""). On ""Queriendo"", he pronounces the Spanish equivalent to the album's title, ""doble juventud"", a phrase whose syllabic density gives it an inherent rhythm of its own.<br/> <br/> The album's gentle hallucination crystallizes on lead single ""I Krill You"", a slowly unfolding suite with a patient melody at odds with its rapid techno pulse. Lange builds the song only to break away at its midpoint to a synthetic choral moment, leaping lucidly from the club to the cathedral. ""It's a dream, a dream, a dream about you again,"" he repeats, calling to an unseen other with the sort of longing that usually only survives inside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3635-arthur-russell/"">Arthur Russell</a> albums. Spritzes of synth brass stand in for slashes of cello; the beats pile, but never overwhelm.<br/> <br/> <i>Double Youth</i> plays as an exercise in reconciling forgotten artifacts with present memories, as anyone who's had the chance to rifle through their former possessions and discover evidence of a totally alien former self knows the uncanny feeling that's articulated so effectively on Helado Negro's latest. The album's title refers most transparently to the twin figures on its cover: two boys being young side by side. But it can also describe the shadows we leave for ourselves, the youth we remember crashing into the husks of youth we discover. Helado Negro animates that conflict, finding not resolution, but harmony in the gaps between selves.</p></div>"|19703.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19703-helado-negro-double-youth/|7.5|Sasha Geffen

They instantly set a psychedelic scene and then spend the next several minutes retracing it, until all the lines blur into a sound that’s constantly morphing and hypnotically static at the same time. However, for this new, limited-edition live album, the duo effect a change that, if not radically reorienting their core aesthetic, at least turns their very band name into one big typo.</p>
<p>While Johnson and Yamada’s job descriptions respectively bill them as singer/guitarist and keyboardist, Moon Duo’s recordings to date have deployed drum machines to bolster their motorik momentum. However, their summer 2013 trek through Europe marked the first time they lugged a proper kit on tour and enlisted a full-time stickman, John Jeffrey, who, following a recommendation from the band’s manager, was hired without so much as a single audition. Of course, it helps that Moon Duo aren’t the sort of band to trouble budding percussionists with complex arrangements or tricky cues to remember. But the show documented here presented Jeffrey with a trial by fire all the same—by having him furiously hammer on the same beat for upwards of 10 minutes at a time in the thick of what was apparently a brutal heat wave. (And even though the Ravenna show was performed at an outdoor beachside stage as opposed to a claustrophobic club, the stifling temperature still prompts Johnson to make a mid-set plea for towels.)</p>
<p>You can feel all that sweat and humidity dripping off this recording, which corrodes the skillfully sculpted fuzz and laser-like rhythmic precision of their studio albums with enough grease and grime to constitute a fire hazard. And with Jeffrey’s imposing kick-drum thump and chain-whipped, tambourine-rattled backbeats added to mix, Moon Duo feel come off less like the blissed-out soundtrack for melting into your rec-room shag carpet than a gang of toughs ready to start a rumble on an overcrowded dancefloor. The big-boom effect also illuminates how Moon Duo savvily update the influence of their canonical psych-punk forbears: the beefier versions of “Mazes”, “I Been Gone”, and “Goners” refashion the Spacemen 3 as the ultimate go-go party band; “Free Action” reroutes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide/"">Suicide</a>’s “Rocket USA” into a foot-stomped heartland hoedown.</p>
<p>Aside from that last track—which gets distended to double the length of the version heard on 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17121-circles/""><i>Circles</i></a>—<i>Live in Ravenna</i> surprisingly doesn’t stretch Moon Duo’s hypno-rock rave-ups too far beyond their original parameters, nor does it yield any significant rethinks of the material. So, on top of capturing the band at an intriguing new phase of their evolution, <i>Live in Ravenna</i> effectively functions as a handy, compact compilation of Moon Duo’s three albums to date (if underscoring their uniform vibe). For more casual trippers, this could be all the Moon Duo you need—but don’t sleep on the digital-only bonus track, “Set It On Fire”, which caps off this hot August night with an incendiary collision of <i>Fun House</i> fuzz and “Tomorrow Never Knows” drum rolls that makes you hope an official rebranding into Moon Trio isn’t too far off. </p></div>"|19654.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19654-moon-duo-live-in-ravenna/|7.4|Stuart Berman

He typifies the behind-the-scenes, slave-to-the-music vibe from which so much dance music springs, and like any great dance artist, Maclean's best work has come via his singles (""<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfJYtbGPgQs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Happy House</a>"", ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15161-the-juan-maclean-you-are-my-destiny/"">You Are My Destiny</a>""). If <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5462-james-murphy/"">James Murphy</a> was the quarterback of the DFA roster, then Maclean was the president of the AV club.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If there's any extra urgency or excitement surrounding Maclean's third studio album, <i>In A Dream</i>, it's that DFA now lacks a flagship act, and Nancy Whang—frequent collaborator, <i>In A Dream</i> cover star, justification for the definite article preceding the Juan's name—seemed to be a burgeoning creative force herself in the waning days of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2598-lcd-soundsystem/"">LCD Soundsystem</a>. Her work on <i>In A Dream</i> is among her best: brassy and affecting, she sings like a punk rocker whose feet have warmed to disco but not her heart.</p>
<p>Which is just as well: Maclean and Whang have been distilling the funk/punk out of this project since 2005's still beloved <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4360-less-than-human/""><i>Less Than Human</i></a>. To wit: within about a minute of the album's start—the cardio motorik of ""A Place Called Space""—we're treated to a searing guitar lead. What Maclean and Whang have settled on here is a more muscular, downtown version of the type of reedy disco-pop that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28334-lindstrom-christabelle/"">Lindstrøm &amp; Christabelle</a> explored on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13848-real-life-is-no-cool/""><i>Real Life Is No Cool</i></a>. <i>In A Dream</i> is hi-def synth boogie, flexing and preening in ways its forbears simply couldn't, as if old Ze Records and italo-disco classics had spent the last 30 years in the gym packing on studio wherewithal and audio fidelity.</p>
<p>When everything comes together, <i>In A Dream</i> is spectacular. ""I've Waited For So Long"" whips around hurriedly as Maclean and Whang trade verses and choruses. ""Running Back To You"" is a slo-mo bass gargle, with Whang's salt-corroded vocals bristling against the perfectly formed contours of the bass synth, which Maclean walks carefully on a leash for the song's duration. ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17042-the-juan-maclean-a-simple-design/"">A Simple Design</a>"" is the most compact, finest ever summation of this partnership, a simple, danceable track that finds the two dancing around each other, Whang's ""la la la""s providing ample space for Maclean's flights of fancy before she grabs the chorus by the throat and caresses it gently.</p>
<p>Problems that have persisted throughout The Juan Maclean's output crop up here as well. Maclean is a less frequent and less irksome vocal presence than on prior records, though he's still uncompelling, pushing through the shoulda-been-anthemic peaks of ""Love Stops Here"" with affectless utterances. Maclean is a masterful synth programmer but not a singular one, and so sometimes <i>In A Dream</i> resembles those beautifully built urban townhouses, trading sturdiness for creativity and sapping some of the fun in the process.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">That's the harshest grenade you can throw at <i>In A Dream</i>, though: it's too comfortable and robust. When the duo come in for the requisite 10-minute, album-closing jam, it feels earned, and it's motive and charming enough not to bore. <i>In A Dream</i> is Maclean and Whang's most fruitful, balanced partnership, and if it fails to truly make a star out of either of them, it cements them as the kind of ever-evolving collaboration DFA was built on.</p></div>"|19767.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19767-the-juan-maclean-in-a-dream/|7.4|Andrew Gaerig

Across three albums in the late 2000s, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19442-vivian-girls/"">Vivian Girls</a>' mix of girl-group sweetness, punk brusqueness, and proto-grunge sludge won them an adoring cult, but it also left the Brooklyn-via-New Jersey band exposed to criticism from the not-so-silent majority this excluded. As her bandmates have gone on to other projects, Ramone (born Cassie Grzymkowski) has continued to evince a dedicated dispassion. Kickball Katy, the bass player, has stepped to the front over three increasingly confident albums with the melancholic, day-dreamy <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29201-la-sera/"">La Sera</a>. Ali Koehler, the drummer, has also taken over the mic for the intrepid fuzz blasters of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31679-upset/"">Upset</a>. Founding Vivian Girls drummer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30148-frankie-rose/"">Frankie Rose</a> graduated into the richly colored synth-pop epitomized by 2012's outstanding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16304-frankie-rose-interstellar/""><i>Interstellar</i></a>. Ramone, by contrast, avoided center stage, splitting lead vocal duties with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27672-woods/"">Woods</a> bassist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31668-kevin-morby/"">Kevin Morby</a> on a pair of casually scuffed LPs with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28076-the-babies"">the Babies</a>.</p>
<p><i>The Time Has Come</i> is Ramone's solo debut, thrusting her conversational voice and lyricism back to the spotlight, but in effect it's another intimate-yet-aloof sidestep. Rather than charge ahead with the gig-ready urgency of Vivian Girls or space out on details like Rose's <i>Interstellar</i>, she has turned in relatively stripped-down album of songs she recorded herself at apartments in New York and Los Angeles. What the time has come for, Ramone murmurs listlessly on the title track, brings to mind the eccentric emoting of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"">Blur</a> guitarist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/846-graham-coxon/"">Graham Coxon</a>'s early solo output—that is, saying ""I love you."" Those aren't always words you want more than certain people to hear.</p>
<p>As with most of Ramone's work, there's an admirable lack of apparent affectation across the album, which should help make it welcome in all places predisposed to love—or even just like—her back. Reverb-soaked and shambolic, with the occasional tambourine or fluid guitar solo, the songs address dark days (""Song of Love""), troubled romance  (""Hangin On""), and enduring affection (""I Send My Love to You""). Despite the low-key recording setup, flourishes here or there break up the potential monotony, as when the nocturnal acoustic gallop of ""I Don't Really Wanna Go"" goes off into psyched-out lava-lamp burbles. Even when Ramone tends toward the tender-hearted melodies of great '90s indie-pop duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3861-the-softies/"">the Softies</a> on ""Sensitive Soul"", she stays deadpan enough to allay the twee-allergic.</p>
<p>Lo-fi bedroom pop prophet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3447-ariel-pink/"">Ariel Pink</a> guests on bass for almost every song, but his presence is understated. <i>T</i><i>he Time Has Come</i>'s press materials cite '60s Greenwich Village enigma <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5009-karen-dalton/"">Karen Dalton</a>, and though the title has been used many times, one notable instance is English folkie Anne Briggs' breakout 1971 album. The grassroots movement where Ramone's effort would fit best is '90s indie culture, right down to the handwritten look of the cover text and the doodles on the record's inner label. </p>
<p>Part of that culture, of course, was the idea of the slacker. Ramone flirts most directly with that image on ""I'm a Freak"", where she flatly insists that she's ""a fucking loser,"" ""a bad egg just ready to crack, hey-hey."" At times, particularly on the dirge-like ""Joe's Song"", she comes across instead like someone who likes her perfectly good eggs a bit undercooked. This is the paradox in which Ramone finds herself: her allure is partly her insular don't-give-a-fuckness, but that can only get her so far. It's hard to say whether she would benefit from the more generous approach to do-it-yourself recording seen on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6468-karen-o/"">Karen O</a>'s ""Rapt"" or even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3184-out-hud/"">Out Hud</a> member Molly Shnick's self-titled Jean on Jean album several years back; she's not them. This much is clear: <i>The Time Has Come </i>is two songs shorter and about the same number of minutes longer than the Vivian Girls' 2008 debut album, and yet it's ultimately a bit slight. The songs are still nonchalant, still brash, but the time for Ramone's next nonchalantly brash <i>big</i> statement may be still to come.</p></div>"|19768.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19768-cassie-ramone-the-time-has-come/|6.7|Marc Hogan

It’s the legendary art-punk band’s first new studio album since 2001’s <i>Hello</i>, and in those intervening 13 years, he hasn't lost his knack for the charm offensive. “The Time Is Now” wobbles and wanders like a tranquilized tiger cub, with a meandering jangle threatening to tug Jad’s string of greeting-card pleasantries alarmingly off center. “I’m so glad you’re you,” he sings through his nose, sounding more like the punk-rock Mister Rogers than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3572-jonathan-richman"">Jonathan Richman</a> ever did.</p>
<p>Richman is one of the few antecedents that went into Half Japanese’s protean stew of primitivist punk when the band formed in the '70s; avowedly amateurish and autodidactic, Jad and his brother David spun the blistering, shambolic rawness of their early singles into tooth-fracturing sweetness of their first masterpiece, 1980’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17841-half-japanese-12-gentlemen-not-beasts/""><i>Half Gentlemen/Not Beasts</i></a> (which featured, not so coincidentally, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E4fp-9BRDI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Modern Lovers cover</a>). Half Japanese is more infamous for the bands they’ve influenced, most notably <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"">Nirvana</a>, although there’s a whole universe of lo-fi disciples tucked away in Jad’s back pocket. <i>Overjoyed </i>shows just how much Half Japanese, despite their reserved seat in the indie continuum, still exist in a hermetic dimension of its own. From the spiky, Voidoids-like jerkiness of “In Its Pull” to the slashing, sidelong surf riffs of “Shining Star”, the album views the rest of the musical world through a kaleidoscope and hears it through a tin can.</p>
<p>That said, <i>Overjoyed</i> isn’t anywhere near as tinny as Half Japanese is known for. Produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1048-deerhoof/"">Deerhoof</a>’s John Dieterich, it’s one of the most full-blooded and competently tracked albums in the band’s catalog. Even when “Meant to Be That Way” lurches off its axis thanks to an onslaught of wiggly, reverberating overdubs, the rhythm section is rock solid; barely a trace of lo-fi glory can be heard on “Do It Nation”, the album’s most distorted and self-destructive track. “Do it, do it, do it,” Jad chants like a bratty version of Malcolm Mooney over a droning, drool-inducing monochord. With maturity comes assuredness, but there’s a lack of desperate vulnerability to<i> Overjoyed</i> that renders it far less fetchingly fragile than its predecessors.</p>
<p>There’s a scene in Jeff Feuerzeig’s 1993 documentary <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcu2ONECf_8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Half Japanese:</i> <i>The Band That Would Be King</i></a><i> </i>in which the band is performing on a makeshift stage for the residents of Duplex Nursing Home in Boston (made famous by David Greenberger’s long-running zine <a href=""http://www.duplexplanet.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Duplex Planet</i></a>). While hatcheting their way through a version of Wilson Pickett’s “In The Midnight Hour”, one of the old men in the audience pulls a harmonica out of his shirt pocket and starts honking along, as if it were the most natural thing in the world to do. Not to paint them as ancient or anything, but the brothers Fair are now closer in age to that old man than they are to the strapping young versions of themselves who forged milestones like <i>Half Gentlemen/Not Beasts</i>. In essence, <i>Overjoyed</i> is the sound of the Fairs playing along with themselves, or at least the sweet, weird boys they used to be—not always with as much spark or chaos, but mashing up the fruits just as gleefully.</p></div>"|19653.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19653-overjoyed/|6.8|Jason Heller

The Athens, Ga. trio started out as an avant-doom band—1996’s <i>Courtesy and Good Will Towards Men</i> featured broken piano interludes and a tortuous cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/787-leonard-cohen"">Leonard Cohen</a>’s “One of Us Cannot Be Wrong.”—then, they shifted into the ZZ Top territory with<i> The Pleaser</i>. They broke up for a while, then reformed right as metal was becoming ""cool"" again, putting out two records, <i>Special Wishes</i> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12005-lifethe-best-game-in-town/"">Life...The Best Game in Town</a>,</i> that combined aspects of their earlier sound. Success eluded them in the '90s, but Harvey Milk earned critical respect during their second run, building a legacy of taking the piss out of themselves at every possible moment. They maintained a bleak sense of humor throughout their career: to wit, a 2010 article featured drummer Kyle Spence and bassist Stephen Tanner <a href=""http://www.self-titledmag.com/2010/03/08/primer-harvey-milk-tear-their-discography-apart-from-the-shitty-blues-rock-of-the-pleaser-to-the-total-creative-bankruptcy-of-their-latest-album/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ripping apart their entire discography</a>. Not much has been heard from the group in the past couple years, but Tanner has resurfaced with a solo project, Music Blues. His debut <i>Things Haven’t Gone Well</i> strips down the funeral blues of Harvey Milk’s last record, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14240-a-small-turn-of-human-kindness/"">A Small Turn of Human Kindness</a></i>. It might be too much of a reduction, though, as Tanner doesn’t exactly betray his legacy, but the record on a whole feels insufficiently fleshed out.</p>
<p>Most of the songs on <i>Things</i> follow the same structure, as Tanner’s guitar emphasizing a few riffs per song, without much else. There’s slight variations—“Trying and Giving Up” and “Great Depression” feature lurching basslines, “Hopelessness and Worthlessness” takes on a more noise-rock shape, and closer “Bonus Track” features modulated drums. “91771” (named for Tanner’s birth year) and “Premature Caesarean Removal Delivery” lead the record with big riffs and a bigger use of space, and while both are satisfying, they don't feature much more in terms of progression. There’s hints of past glories, but despite these songs' conciseness, the record can feel like a slog. Oddly, the longer songs—“It's Not Going to Get Better” and “The Price is Wrong”—aren’t as much of a chore to listen to, perhaps because they feel more developed than most of the album.</p>
<p><i>Things</i> comes across as a collection of skeletal tracks; throughout the record, there are moments where it feels like a killer lyric from Tanner or Creston Spires, his longtime cohort in Harvey Milk, would flesh things out a little more. One endearing moment of weirdness, however, is “Teach the Children,” a slowed down snippet of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young’s “Teach the Children Well.” The folk-rock standby becomes the type of demonic of telepathy that got TV pastors and parents riled up in the '80s, with the same evil haziness that permeated DJ Screw’s finest mixes. <i>Things</i> could use more of the unique personality contained in ""Teach the Children"", and while it’s nice to see that someone from Harvey Milk is still actively making music, it's hard to accept <i>Things</i> as Tanner’s true return.</p></div>"|19624.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19624-music-blues-things-havent-gone-well/|6.0|Andy O'Connor

EP 2 X 3</i>, you could actually call him an early face on the front lines. But while Mono/Poly isn't without his own identity, he's spent much of the last six years hopping from mode to mode and trying his best to leave unmistakably individual fingerprints all over whatever feels a few months away from really popping. Between the ethereal yet jittery soul of his scattered singles throughout the late '00s, the b-boy IDM of his self-released 2010 full-length <i>Paramatma</i>, and the overdriven sludgestep on 2011's <i>Manifestations</i> EP, there's a lot of strong work in the past to justify excitement for his Brainfeeder debut full-length.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>There's just one catch: his adaptability goes hand in hand with his unpredictability, and it's still unclear which sound he's best at. </span><i>Golden Skies </i><span>pulls a new mode to the fore—one that exhibits the ease with which he draws out flowing ambience, tamps down his noisier tendencies, and sneaks in trace elements of techno that add a sharp edge to his floatier moments. If that sounds frustratingly vague, well, that's the kind of sound we're dealing with here. It's an instrumental beat record where texture matters more than just about anything else from genre to mood.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It's still rewarding to work your way through interpretations of those other issues, though. One of the early jolts of surprise on this record takes place when opening cut ""Winds of Change"" drops some straight-up acid house 303 squelches into the proceedings, taking a track that sounded like the prettiest possible rendition of sheet metal being torn apart over <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland"">Timbaland</a> drums and drawing all kinds of directional arrows spiraling out from its center. There's nods to R&amp;B's low-lit, minimal corners, including the album's sole vocal track, the Mendee Ichikawa feature ""Empyrean"", which blooms into a spacious swoon. Rock-solid beats crop up to knock around elastic vocal snippets through a curtain of burbling arpeggios on ""Alpha &amp; Omega"" and ""Urania"", pierce the hovering chords of ""Night Garden"", and boost the funk-fusion oomph of ""Gamma,"" which radiates like a space heater.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The big hook on <i>Golden Skies</i> to pull listeners in centers around just what Mono/Poly does with well-known synthesizer sounds. The record resembles a lot of recent Brainfeeder-y stuff you might've heard before, except tinkered with a bit and with a more dazed approach to the cosmic allusions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31572-ras-g/"">Ras G</a>'s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18373-ras-g-back-on-the-planet/"">Back on the Planet</a>, </i>or the euphoric disorientation of Flying Lotus' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17115-until-the-quiet-comes/""><i>Until the Quiet Comes</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"">Thundercat</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18156-thundercat-apocalypse/""><i>Apocalypse</i></a>. (Incidentally, that latter album featured a track that Mono/Poly collaborated on, ""Heartbreaks + Setbacks"", that anticipated this album's sound.) It sounds like he's got a while to go before he arrives at a signature style, which is a good thing, because his current efforts to pull everything at reach into his orbit makes for some appealing mutations.</p></div>"|19629.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19629-monopoly-golden-skies/|7.3|Nate Patrin

Marked by the sort of puerile whimsy that can only really happen once a career, it split the difference between doe-eyed doo-wop and remember-the-'90s pop-R&amp;B (the latter intentionally courting the ensuing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10697-mariah-carey/"">Mariah</a> comparisons). Grande proved just the type to pull off this sort of broad-stroked pastiche: she’s a theater kid at heart, slipping in and out of characters with practiced finesse (she’s got an arsenal of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rUBVUzHiD8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>impressions</span></a> on YouTube, from Britney Spears to a crying lamb). In a way, it was a risk—these sorts of throwbacks were, if not totally unfashionable, decidedly out of season.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But it was a calculated risk, one that blatantly positioned Grande as a wholesome, PG-rated alternative to the ratchet Mileys of the 2013 pop spectrum. Despite her obvious training—what more can be said about That Voice?—there was a pointed adolescence to <i>Yours Truly</i>, down to the eerily infantilized (and wisely scrapped) initial <a href=""http://www.idolator.com/7474575/ariana-grande-yours-truly-album-cover"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>album art</span></a>. And the Instagram-filter nostalgia, though pretty damn adorable, often rendered the project impersonal. Though it’s her calling card, Grande’s voice doubles as a weapon and a shield; amid all the puppy-love ballads, the album’s emotional centerpiece had her professing her undying love, not for a boy, but for a piano. And fittingly so: the emotional charge of Grande’s music comes from the rush of singing as an act, the clear delight she takes in the power of her own voice, moreso than whatever she’s actually singing about.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On <i>My Everything</i>, Grande ditches the manic-Disney-dream-girl ballads and goes straight for the bangers; while it may not be as consistent a statement as <i>Yours Truly</i>, it’s refreshingly grown-up. It’s no coincidence that the album’s two lead singles were produced by Max Martin, the guy who practically defined millennial pop bildungsroman and, 14 years ago, penned “Oops!…I Did It Again” and “Stronger” for a transitional Britney. They might be the year’s strongest one-two punch of singles: “Problem”, with its alluringly strange reverse-build-up (Grande’s howling pre-chorus primes us for an even bigger release, only to drop impishly into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"">Big Sean</a> whispers, mirroring the un-met expectations of the song’s bad-news boyfriend), and the Zedd-produced stomper “Break Free”, a colossal kiss-off that doubles as a “Stronger” for the EDM age. Grande’s side-step to the dancefloor feels pre-ordained, rather than a cash-out: “Break Free”’s festival-closing ambition perfectly pairs with her stadium-sized voice, and injects some much-needed femininity into EDM’s typical machismo.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Where <i>Yours Truly</i> was willfully off-trend, <i>My Everything</i> reveals a better understanding of “cool,” even if it occasionally misses the mark. Here, Grande exists gleefully in her own age, rather than gesturing vaguely towards a second-hand idea of “retro.” Even when the plinky soda-fountain sounds of her debut trickle back in, as on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30860-cashmere-cat"">Cashmere Cat</a>-produced “Be My Baby”, the effect is more <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29899-terius-nash/"">Terius Nash</a> than Pinterest-board pastiche. The features represent more grown-up choices, and coax some stunning performances out of typically middle-of-the-road guests: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"">the Weeknd</a> skulks out from the shadows and into the light on throbbing big-room ballad “Love Me Harder”, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30648-aap-ferg"">A$AP Ferg</a> delivers arguably his best guest spot ever on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5870-christina-aguilera/"">Christina Aguilera</a>-nodding sex jam “Hands On Me”.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">It’s fitting that the two most sexually explicit songs on the album are some of its best; <i>Yours Truly</i>’s blinky innocence would’ve bordered on patronizing if carried on any longer. It’s bigger than sex-positivity, though—Grande’s directness in general is what's so refreshing. Where she once coyly avoided her crush’s gaze, here she stares him dead in the eyes with to-the-point come-ons like “May be a little thing, but I like that long.” In a recent <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/arts/music/ariana-grande-prepares-my-everything.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span><i>New York Times</i> feature</span></a>, Grande says longingly, of the uphill battle against her squeaky-clean image, “Maybe one day I’ll get away with something naughty.” This certainly feels like a start.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Thanks to those chameleonic theater roots, Grande’s always been able to pull off rap crossovers better than peers like Katy Perry, but despite the handful of successful guest spots, her taste in rap features remains tragic. </span><i>My Everything</i><span>’s worst moments revolve around hokey appearances from serial cornballs Big Sean and Childish Gambino. The former drops clunker after clunker on “Best Mistake”, making a mockery of the song’s serious tone with hysterically awful lines like “How can we keep the feelings fresh/ How do we Ziploc it?” The latter takes the “he’s cheating… with a MAN!” storyline and rubs its face in its own feces with the beyond questionable punchline “Yes, I’m a G, from the A, and they ask Y” (</span><span>get it, guys?</span><span>)—as though the message wasn’t already made painfully obvious by the dorky, distracting “I’m Coming Out” sample running underneath Grande’s vocals. It's a bizarre choice for a singer whose occasional unintelligibility is already something of a </span><span><a href=""http://gawker.com/ariana-grande-girl-what-are-you-even-talking-about-1626555476"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">meme.</a></span></p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-10be6bea-1dec-d220-9c69-53cf1c560b36""><span>Still, despite its missteps, </span><i>My Everything</i><span> feels like Grande’s arrival as a true pop fixture, not just a charming novelty. Where she once felt like an actor dutifully playing the part of blinky-eyed, malt-sipping romantic, here Grande slowly but confidently comes into her own; and while her personality may still take a backseat to her technical skill, it’s beginning to wink through the theatrics. Turns out, so-called mini-Mariah can hold her own in 2014; and while the best songs here may not be timeless, they certainly feel right for right now.</span></span></p></div>"|19765.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19765-ariana-grande-my-everything/|7.7|Meaghan Garvey

It may not be the <i>whole</i> world, but for many of its artists, it’s a <i>universe</i>, one where you can spend an entire career creating rewarding art. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate"">Real Estate</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5651-titus-andronicus"">Titus Andronicus</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2477-lifetime"">Lifetime</a> are all considered quintessentially “suburban,” and they are nothing alike—and the same goes for <i>Garden State</i> and the movies of Todd Solondz. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen"">Bruce Springsteen</a> and “The Sopranos” are revered for their realistic works of fiction, Bon Jovi and ""Jersey Shore"" less so for their fictional works of ""reality""; a fine line exists between archetype and stereotype. Its economy and geography is every bit as contradictory and complex—New Jersey’s wealthiest pockets are stuffed with families fleeing New York City and Philadelphia, while its own metropolises are some of America’s most notoriously blighted. It’s named the Garden State for good reason, while its beaches are a punchline for pollution. The state represents American sprawl and dichotomy crammed into a manageable space—the perfect map for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27599-cymbals-eat-guitars"">Cymbals Eat Guitars</a> to project <i>LOSE</i>, a sprawling, complex, and fascinating document of American indie rock.</p>
<p>It’s a fitting occurrence, though still surprising. Most bands rep Jersey from the start; in 2009, Cymbals Eat Guitars briefly identified as an NYC band, though their music existed on MySpace and encompassed the Pacific Northwest, drawing heavily on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/500-built-to-spill"">Built to Spill</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2800-modest-mouse"">Modest Mouse</a>. By 2011’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15757-lenses-alien/""><i>Lenses Alien</i></a>, they settled in the pop culture void of Staten Island, while the album seemed to take place entirely within Joseph D’Agostino’s head. An often compelling record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/9476-cymbals-eat-guitars"">D’Agostino has since admitted that it makes more sense if you’re high</a>, but also that its unwieldy songs are almost impossible to play if you’ve had more than two beers.</p>
<p>So <i>LOSE</i> is a homecoming in multiple ways<span>—</span>D’Agostino looks back on his upbringing and New Jersey’s vast catalog of pop culture folklore while the band makes the occasional anthemic moments that elevated <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12826-why-there-are-mountains/"">Why There Are Mountains</a></i> the primary purpose of each song. The near-replication of its length and chord progression casts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/55175-cymbals-eat-guitars-announce-new-album-lose-share-jackson/"">“Jackson”</a> and a sequel to <i>Mountains</i>’ massive opener “...And the Hazy Sea.” However, where the latter exploded on impact and played only on the vertiginous disparity between its volcanic eruptions and minutes of calm, “Jackson” evenly and expertly delivers its peaks in a variety of ways <span>—</span>D’Agostino patiently works towards an arcing chorus worthy of its <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3840-elliott-smith"">Elliott Smith</a> influence, while a triumphant guitar solo emerges from the kind of post-rock blur that would typically signal the closure of a Cymbals Eat Guitars song. The riff from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/17011-cymbals-eat-guitars-warning/"">“Warning”</a> adds a couple of sour, flatted notes to the jangly progression from “Shore Points,” which soundtracked a leisurely drive down the coast on <i>Lenses Alien</i>. In a thrilling sprint towards a brash chorus, “Warning” recklessly slams on the gas without checking the brakes.</p>
<p>Cymbals Eat Guitars aren’t the same band that made <i>Why There Are Mountains.</i> In fact, they’re an actual <i>band</i> now, rather than a cast of supporting players beholden to D'Agostino's ideas. The <i>Lenses Alien</i> lineup returns with a new drummer (Andrew Dole) and a new rhythmic drive; producer John Agnello lends presence and texture, rendering these topographic songs 3D, while the rhythm section acts as D’Agostino’s OnStar<span>—</span>he’s still free to wander wherever, yet there’s a framework and a destination. When he hits on a tangent, he’s given direction an ultimate resolution, so Cymbals Eat Guitars have the confidence to strike out to stranger territories. “Laramie” manages to span the lonesome crowded west and Muscle Shoals soul before levitating to an astral, pedal-stomping freakout. “Chambers” and “Lifenet” are slices of Staten Island living delivered as slick, heartland radio rock. It's all presented with unity rather than erratic dilettantism; ""indie rock"" is Cymbals Eat Guitars' domain and they cover its entirety.</p>
<p>And yet, the music is once again outdone by D’Agostino’s lyrics, deeply personal and relatable, referential without being academic, prone to poetic flight and realistic grounding. Lyric writing in rock music—or, really, any genre—rarely possesses the substance and depth displayed on <i>LOSE</i>. During an aborted drug deal in “Chambers”, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4628-wu-tang-clan"">Wu-Tang Clan</a> get an offhand shout, and Shaolin’s finest would envy the spiced-out, scene-setting vividness given to “Warning”<span>—</span>“Pennants stiffen on the strip/ Wind is whipping through the tinsel fixed to the dealership/And you're looking mighty ghostly just like Bowie on Soul Train/ Wrapped in your sable.”   </p>
<p>RZA would also approve of D’Agostino’s writing regimen, which uses a cornucopia of pharmaceuticals as a muse and meditation as a mental exercise. As a result, <i>LOSE</i> fixates on small moments of startling lucidity and figures out where they fit into the bigger picture. During bookends “Jackson” and “2 Hip Soul (Floyd’s Tomb)”, New Jersey’s more obscure, shameful race relations come to the fore<span>—</span>the former evokes a <a href=""http://weirdnj.com/stories/fabled-people-and-places/jackson-whites/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">possibly apocryphal band of Native American outlaws</a> during a meditation on the afterlife, while “2 Hip Soul” lends a redneck’s comeuppance a mythical quality high school rumors tend to acquire. A classmate falls face-first into a firepit at a kegger, returning with a load of pills and a compression sleeve under his John Deere hat and Carhartts, potentially karmic retribution for his hobby of carving swastikas into trees and clubbing ostriches with PVC piping at the local zoo.</p>
<p>During “Chambers”, D’Agostino recalls his parents buying him a dog, the subsequent passing of which served in a retrospect as a way “To learn about loss/ The slow education.” His insight captures a different and devastating lesson about death on the stunning power ballad “Child Bride”. D’Agostino’s tender acoustic fingerpicking only serves to make his confessional memories all the more shocking<span>—</span>“You were my best friend/ Until your dad slapped the living shit out of you.” Its title serves as cruel foreshadowing for someone whose path was set as a youth by circumstances beyond his control; an alcoholic mother instigates a sudden relocation, the friend sells off all his possessions, moves south and catches D’Agostino at a show in Orlando with a new girlfriend and a crack addiction. He offers a hit and D’Agostino refuses, because “My heart would explode,” either from the drugs or just from the stark realization of how he and his friend ended up in the same place. The final chorus soars, while D’Agostino lies crushed, realizing he’s been given nothing but opportunity and support—and here he is, wasting his 20s getting high in less unflattering ways.</p>
<p>Yet, D’Agostino thoroughly understands how he and countless others get to this point, and it’s explored in its entirety during <i>LOSE</i>’s thesis statement, “XR”. It’s the song that most explicitly references the death of Benjamin High, D’Agostino’s closest friend and musical collaborator, and the inspiration for the newly introspective and self-disclosing lyrics.  The awful coincidence of his last name is used as a sobering double entendre during a beer-raising coda<span>—</span>“High is just a tingling behind my eyes/ Got no serotonin left.” Before he gets to that point, “XR” wraps up an entire adolescence of escape into drugs and rock ‘n roll within 2:30 of rabble-rousing, harmonica-huffing cow-punk. D’Agostino barks through a distorted microphone, “Here I am again at Ben’s MySpace grave,” and traces back to how, at first, drugs are used to accompany incredible, fleeting moments of youth. Then, they become a means of trying to get that feeling back, as a trip to the record store results in buying CDs for “ripping rails, not listening to.” And finally, it becomes a way to push through the numbness of being unable to generate a substitute<span>—</span>“Wanna wake up wanting to listen to records/ But those old feelings elude me.”   </p>
<p>Those feelings are most closely associated with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4626-the-wrens"">the Wrens</a> throughout <i>LOSE—</i>D’Agostino and High take a road trip to Philly for a house show and their van-ride duet of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SNf6YBNuXM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“I Guess We’re Done”</a> (“I’ll do the Kev and you can do the Charles”) is recalled on “Laramie”. Cymbals Eat Guitars owe a lot to that band—they described them as <a href=""http://www.wonderingsound.com/feature/cymbals-eat-guitars-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“our Beatles”</a>, and Charles Bissell produced <i>Why There Are Mountains</i>. In some ways, Cymbals Eat Guitars got to live the experience the Wrens related on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3rTVfGr56s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“This Boy is Exhausted”</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZU3ywyEqq8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Boys, You Won’t”</a><span>—</span>playing to empty rooms with a complete lack of buzz, taking up deadening day jobs after having blown their college years. They also learned that if you make a record at the level of <i>The Meadowlands</i>, you can foster a fanbase willing to wait over a decade for new music. So even if D’Agostino’s lyrics are rife with death, depression and doubt, <i>LOSE</i> exudes earned resilience, of getting through shit and getting your shit together. Since it's more clear than ever that the Wrens—and Built to Spill and Modest Mouse—aren't currently going to provide <i>those</i> feelings that currently elude listeners, Cymbals Eat Guitars have realized the challenge facing them all along; the result makes the distinction between protege and peer nearly indistinguishable.</p></div>"|19723.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19723-cymbals-eat-guitars-lose/|8.2|Ian Cohen

Compared with earlier regional moments, where local buzz propelled a handful of artists to the national stage, the Internet's clear-glass window into this world—and the increased marketing savvy of even its least-established teenagers—has made the city's multiple scenes appear saturated. This is further exaggerated by the reams of imitators the city's bigger stars—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"">Chief Keef</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31057-chance-the-rapper/"">Chance the Rapper</a>—have inspired. With limited oxygen in a competitive space, a raft of rookie artists have stubbornly hoisted themselves into the air, grasping for whichever angle best fits.</p>
<p>With the release of <i>The Water(S)</i> earlier this month, 6'5"" Alabama-born, Chicago-raised rapper Mick Jenkins towers above most of the city's newcomers, literally and figuratively. Like collaborators Chance the Rapper, Saba, and No Name Gypsy, he's a product of Chicago's vibrant poetry scene, and a sharp disciple of a similar lyrical tradition. Jenkins is a conscientious person, a writer drawn to literary symbolism, punctuating the poetic obliqueness of his bars with barbed truths. His debut, 2013's jazzy <i>Trees &amp; Truths</i>, was loose and indistinct. The improved songcraft of <i>The </i><i>Water(S)</i> tightens his focus, yet each track feels of a piece, its cohesive sound reflective of the album's titular metaphor.</p>
<p>This mixtape does bear an evident debt to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29812-kendrick-lamar/"">Kendrick Lamar</a>, and at times, <i>The </i><i>Water(S)</i> feels like an album-length tribute to Kendrick's ""Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst"" and ""Swimming Pools (Drank)"". Although the first few songs take on amorphous shape of album tracks, Jenkins' very first verse grounds them in ""The Art of Peer Pressure""-like action and movement: ""It was 91st and Laney, we were six deep, steppin' up the stairs/ Black Buick with a slick creep, moving down the block, we had froze/ Felt the tension in my toes…"" But Mick Jenkins' bold delivery is nothing like Lamar's introverted one. Even when Jenkins' poetical hand gets a bit too free with the pen, his verses are drawn together by the unbroken stride of his words. He stands apart thanks to a rap style that gives muscle to a moral position.</p>
<p>As Guru once said, it's mostly the voice: deep and sonorous, Jenkins' vocals resonate with a particularly masculine brand of authority. Where Chance the Rapper's voice affects a manic, elastic character, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32308-vic-mensa/"">Vic Mensa</a> aims for empathic transcendence, Mick Jenkins is practical, decisive, and no-nonsense. Uninterested in high-minded frivolities, he often sounds like he's getting to the point, even when he isn't: ""Everybody wanna be the back of a D-Rose"" is a bit of coded language (Derrick Rose's jersey has the number one on the back), but his delivery still gives this wordplay pointed gravitas. Serious and dignified, he wears his voice like a Sunday suit.</p>
<p>This confident rhetorical style is underpinned by the anxiety of a person who perceives that the world has issued him a false bill of sale. Clear-eyed, he recognizes the superficiality of his peers' wealth and status obsessions and the counterfeit choices the world has presented them. For Mick Jenkins, ""water"" represents spiritual nourishment, clarity, purpose, qualities essential to life yet too easily ignored by the distracted. This isn't just standard young adult nonconformism—although it is that, too—but in the context of Chicago's South Side, where ""Little niggas got guns now/ And they carry them to the fuckin' beat,"" a matter of life and death. Mick Jenkins combats this anxious frustration with aggressive confidence, willing his truth to reshape a warped reality.</p>
<p>The album's best songs foreground his words. The sparse, unsettling ""Jazz"", which twists with terse ambiguity, lets his vocals take center stage. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27104-statik-selektah/"">Statik Selektah</a>'s ""Black Sheep"" gives the back half some sleek momentum, while the frenetic ""Who Else"" upends the casual atmosphere with some of Jenkins' most focused writing. But <i>The </i><i>Water(S)</i> peaks with the climactic DJ Dahi-produced urgency of ""Dehydration"", where each word seems underlined for maximum dramatic impact. Closer ""Jerome"" with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30517-joey-bada/"">Joey Bada$$</a>—the album's most atypical track—feels like an exuberant Lost Boyz tribute, and a welcome exultation after a record of stern intensity.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast with Mick Jenkins' brolic tone, the album's leisurely production is soothingly therapeutic, all smudged-graphite edges. Where his first album was jazzy in a general sense, <i>The </i><i>Water(S)'</i> languid guitar lines and airy atmosphere bathe the music in soft-focus blues and greens, a watercolor that recalls the placid cool of '60s modal jazz. The connection between aggression and relaxation is essential: his vocals keep the chilled production dynamic, while the reassuring ambiance is immersive, sanding the rough edges on occasionally weighty material.</p>
<p>Heaviest of all is ""Martyrs"", released as a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xLEGmijvMg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> at the end of last year. The visuals include a flashed simulacrum of Chief Keef's ""Don't Like"" video, but with Jenkins and each dreadlocked extra wearing a noose. The beat, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4639-kanye-west/"">Kanye</a>'s ""Blood on the Leaves"", co-opts a conceptually loaded sample in Billie Holiday's ""Strange Fruit"". His lyrics attack youthful hypocrisy and conformity, the empty pursuit of money and sex, and his peers' susceptibility to these traps. This is his truth, and a welcome counter to the blithe attitude many rap fans have carried over the last two decades of violence in the form. All the same, as Mick Jenkins grows in stature, he may experience the sensation of having people agree for the wrong reasons; that his words, as potent as they are, could easily be co-opted by those who would demonize teenagers for their own oppression—a mirrored experience of what may have gone through Keef's mind the first time he saw a crowd of white fans rap the hook to ""I Don't Like"". One's eyes can never be too open, but at least we can trust Mick Jenkins to tell us how he sees it.</p></div>"|19745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19745-mick-jenkins-the-waters/|7.8|David Drake

Both scenes (where they are separate, and where they bleed together) have long been defined by super-producers, but few—including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5205-timbaland/"">Timbaland</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3082-the-neptunes/"">the Neptunes</a>, whose names can’t help be evoked in this conversation—have had runs as successful as Mustard’s, who has placed no less than 15 songs on various Billboard charts this year. That list includes some of the year’s most enduring songs—from Kid Ink’s “Show Me” to Tinashe’s “2 On”—but more to the point is Mustard’s total and overwhelming ubiquity. It's not uncommon this year to turn on the radio, hit ""play"" on a playlist, walk into a party or enter a store, and hear a succession of Mustard’s beats. His sound has become so attached to mainstream urban music that it’s almost impossible to decipher where DJ Mustard ends and contemporary rap and R&amp;B begins.</p>
<p>But we should never confuse quantity for quality, and Mustard’s sound is too divisive for him to be hailed as a universal genius like some of his predecessors have been. The criticism of his beats is obvious even to his supporters: they are simple and repetitive, not just individually but when taken together, often just an easily digestible series of pulses and snaps. Recently, <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/29rjm3/dudes_yelling_hey_on_hiphop_tracks_so_hot_right/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a video posted to Reddit</a> that catalogs a series of Mustard-produced singles built around the incessant chant of “Hey!” generated a thousand-comment thread of skepticism if not derision. The criticism—that any idiot with a working brain and two hands could churn out these beats—is not lost on the man himself. “Everybody say it’s so easy to make my beats,” Mustard <a href=""https://twitter.com/DJmustard/status/504353300863803392"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tweeted</a> a few days ago. “[Well] take a swing at it you should be rich [in] no time cause I am.” The tweet was punctuated by two emojis that are crying while laughing.</p>
<p>Yet Mustard is nothing if not an innovative producer. His innovations don’t have the creative breadth of Timbaland, no doubt, but they are innovations nonetheless, and they have helped sustain the top-level of an art form that has been floundering commercially for years. One thing Mustard doesn’t get enough credit for is solving the Rubik’s Cube that is black music in the EDM era. Prior to his rise, pairings of rap and R&amp;B with dance music—from successful crossovers like Pitbull, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10008-usher/"">Usher</a>, and Chris Brown to mid-tier artists like Waka Flocka Flame and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7025-just-blaze/"">Just Blaze</a> working the EDM festival circuit—were shotgun marriages borne less out of creative inspiration than survivalist instinct. These collaborations were mostly garish and sad, but Mustard found a way to bring house music (back) to rap and R&amp;B by making it an outgrowth of his own bleepy, up-tempo beats. He did it first with Ty Dolla $ign’s “Paranoid”—which nicks the organ-like keyboard sound of many a ‘90s house song—and then with “Show Me” and Jeremih’s “Don’t Tell ‘Em”, both of which lift parts of actual ‘90s house songs. The latter two have been pop crossovers at a time when most black artists have found a ceiling over their heads, and they have positioned Mustard less as a rap strip-miner and more as a sort of spiritual heir of Afrika Bambaataa and “Planet Rock”.</p>
<p>But most importantly, Mustard has given rap and R&amp;B music a center. The genesis of his sound is in Atlanta club music spanning <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6154-lil-jon/"">Lil Jon</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29984-travis-porter/"">Travis Porter</a> and parts of multiple generations of West Coast rap from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4817-dr-dre/"">Dr. Dre</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6299-too-hort/"">Too $hort</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5867-keak-da-sneak"">Keak Da Sneak</a>, so naturally, many of Mustard’s early songs acted as a bridge for the contemporary rap scenes in the South and West. But as his popularity has grown, his net has widened: not just from rap to R&amp;B, but also from artists in Atlanta and Los Angeles to others in the Midwest (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27945-jeremih/"">Jeremih</a>) and East Coast (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30094-french-montana/"">French Montana</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28233-wiz-khalifa/"">Wiz Khalifa</a>). Whereas producers <i>du jour </i>of recent vintage such as Lex Luger and Mike Will elevated a certain region’s artists over others, <span>the simplicity of Mustard’s beats has proven to be malleable for artists with different approaches and fanbases. </span> Though many are still suspicious of his sound, Mustard is a uniter instead of a divider.</p>
<p>Despite all of that, it’s impossible to forget that DJ Mustard comes from Los Angeles. His music pulls from many places but its heart is L.A. and that blood pumps through its veins. You can hear it in the squelching, rubbery bass on tracks like “Show Me”, YG’s “My Nigga”, and his own “Vato”, but also in the sneering swagger adopted by many of the rappers who slide onto his beats. That Mustard is L.A. and L.A. is Mustard seems to be the motive behind <i>10 Summers</i>, his first album under his own name. Though the title makes a grand claim—that Mustard will be rap’s overlord for 10 straight summers—the album itself is a small, almost humble gesture toward his hometown, a sort of epilogue to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19164-yg-my-krazy-life/""><i>My Krazy Life</i></a>, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32179-yg/"">YG</a> album produced largely by Mustard that instantly entered the conversation of classic L.A. rap full-lengths.</p>
<p>Mustard seems to have let his poppier, dancier side dominate his productions as of late, but <i>10 Summers </i>pulls his sound all the way back to the beginning, with a set of tracks that explicitly connects him to the everlasting influence of Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg’s G-funk. It opens with a trio of songs that are reverent and distinctive only in the context of contemporary rap, but Mustard and the local rappers that lead off the album—from bigger names like Nipsey Hussle and Dom Kennedy to lesser-known entities like TeeCee and RJ—are skilled and able imitators. The whiny synthesizers and quaking bass of these opening tracks is Mustard’s sound at its most elemental and it sets the table for rapping that often amounts to very good impersonations of Snoop Dogg (the hook on “Low Low”) and Too $hort (the opening verse of “Ghetto Tales”). Though some might have wanted Mustard to piece together a star-studded album, he opens <i>10 Summers </i>with an argument a certain type of chef might make: that doing the classics really well can be more satisfying than constantly trying to reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s when all the big names show up that the album drags a bit. “No Reason”, with YG and Jeezy, is a fun little Frankenstein of “Who Do You Love” and “My Nigga”, but what follows are a pair of tracks with big names that have the stale air of DJ Khaled’s bloated projects. “Giuseppe” is just about the most average Mustard song that either 2 Chainz or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4718-young-jeezy"">Jeezy</a>—both frequent collaborators—have ever appeared on. And “Face Down”—the big ticket item featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"">Lil Wayne</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"">Big Sean</a>, YG, and Lil Boosie—is a poorly mastered mess that is far less than the sum of its parts. After the delightfully slinky “Down on Me”—in which Mustard draws another line, this time to New Orleans bounce music—the album dips to its lowest point with the annoyingly squeaky <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31412-iamsu/"">Iamsu!</a> vehicle “Can’t Tell Me”.</p>
<p><i>10 Summers </i>closes with four R&amp;B tracks—two songs and two interludes, all of which act almost as palette cleansers after the unrelenting hardness of the previous eight numbers. The two full tracks—“4 Digits”, a showcase for up-and-coming vocalist Eric Bellinger, and “Deep”, a radio-ready single if Mustard wants to push it—go down like cold beers on a hot day, memorable for their understated perfection. But more tantalizing are the interludes (which are hopefully previews of full tracks), one from Tinashe and the other from Ty Dolla $ign. They clock in at barely over a minute in total but are deeply tuneful, and they suggest that Mustard has digested the same funk and soul records that inspired a L.A. luminary like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4883-dj-quik/"">DJ Quik</a> and that he’s more versatile than people want to believe.</p>
<p>Both interludes are also presented as random radio dispatches, and on the Tinashe interlude Mustard makes another reference to criticism of his omnipresence. It opens with a short skit in which a man and a woman switch on the radio only to hear a string of Mustard tracks. “I’m tired of this shit,” the man says to the woman as “Paranoid” plays in the background. She flips the dial and we hear T-Pain’s “Up Down (Do This All Day)"", to which he responds, “Hell <i>nah</i>, bitch, I’m tired of this nigga.” She turns the dial once more and we hear the new Tinashe track. It’s a fair warning. </p></div>"|19709.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19709-dj-mustard-10-summers/|7.7|Jordan Sargent

Labs and dance-pop whizzes StarGate. <i>Cabin Fever 2</i> matched wares with Bay Area production squad The Invasion and L.A. rapper Problem, then <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17391-onifc/""><i>O.N.I.F.C.</i></a> traded it all in for plush, moneyed cloud rap. On this spring’s <i>28 Grams</i>, it was back to the trap, and Wiz’s third album <i>Blacc Hollywood </i>nobly attempts to pin these rangy genre excursions down onto a single album. </p>
<p class=""p1"">From the smooth jack of Ghost Loft’s <i>Kitsuné America 2 </i>single “So High” to ace placements from radio titan Dr. Luke and usual suspects I.D. Labs and Sledgren, <i>Blacc Hollywood</i>’s production choices are inspired—but you could never mistake it for possessing an adventurous streak, thanks to the waxen array of prurient drug raps at center stage. It’s possible for an artist to be <i>too</i> on brand, and Wiz’s music is almost monomaniacally obsessed with outlining how much weed he has amassed and his plans for burning through it. He’s got his own strain of Afghan kush (“KK”), he breaks it up with a grinder (“So High”), he smokes it out of his own brand of rolling papers (“Raw”), he does this every day (“Stayin Out All Night”), sometimes in his car. (“We Dem Boyz”). <i>Blacc Hollywood </i>is a blur of late night bottle service orders and wake-n-bake seshes that imparts more elite weedhead bonafides than hopes or dreams.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But people don’t come to a Wiz Khalifa album to plunder the mysteries of the heart—they come to party. The issue, then, is that Wiz doesn’t sound like the guy rocking the party so much as the one out back baked as shit and melting into a couch. There’s a wispy resignation in his voice and a faint, noncommittal thread in the songwriting that sends a few of these songs across the line from pop accessibility to plasticity. “Hope” invites a group of gold-digging clubgoers to “Come fuck with the stoner and get stoned.” “The Sleaze” informs us that Wiz “Just copped the newest thing” and “did it with ease,” without divulging what, exactly, he bought. “So High” caps every line with an enthused “Uh-huh” refrain, but rather than wringing humor or menace from the device (a la Juvenile’s classic “Ha”) Wiz hurtles a stream of minutiae about what happens after he lights up. (“In my car, uh-huh/ Cruisin’ down the street, uh-huh/ So stoned I’ma need something to eat, uh-huh”)</p>
<p class=""p1"">Sometimes the pared down songwriting approach succeeds. “Raw” rides twinkling synths and 808s with a spirited <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane"">Gucci Mane</a> flow so in pocket you forget it’s kind of a <span class=""s1"">commercial</span>. Lead single “We Dem Boyz” delivers the album’s biggest, easiest thrill by dispensing with rapping almost entirely, sliding into a pillowy Detail production with a dash of Auto-Tune and a lyric sheet largely comprised of the titular chant: “Hol’ up, hol’ up, hol’ up, we dem boyz!” Wiz isn’t a character possessed of the right mixture of slapstick and real danger to pull this kind of rarefied goon posturing off without a wink, but the absurdity is easily half the fun. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Elsewhere, Khalifa wins when he calls in a friend. “House in the Hills” reunites him with <i>How Fly </i>costar <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29043-curreny/"">Curren$y</a> for an aspirational banger that’s home to some of the album’s best pure rapping. “KK” avoids disaster by turning its second half over to Memphis drug rap legends <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12355-juicy-j/"">Juicy J</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5532-project-pat/"">Project Pat</a>. Taylor Gang newbie <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31519-ty-dolla-ign/"">Ty Dolla $ign</a>’s blithe hooks on “Hope” and “Still Down” are among the album’s best, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"">Nicki Minaj</a>’s assist on verse three of album closer “True Colors” curtly immolates just about everything that came before it. Wiz fares much better when challenged, and the more real estate he cedes to guests, the less opportunities he’s afforded to trip himself up. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Blacc Hollywood </i>is peak Khalifa—bleary eyed, genteel and, eager to please—but these qualities are just as often foibles as strengths, as a glut of pop-rap neck-massages bears out. Melodies coast, but they don’t always stick; everything’s too mannered, too clean, and the album is marred by a clinicality further punctuated by its bonus tracks. Cuts like “You and Your Friends” and “On Me” are looser and dirtier than anything on the album proper, and while the “We Dem Boyz” remix guts much of what made the original great, and “Incense” is essentially a bath of half-intelligible Auto-Tuned vocalizing, they stand out for taking risks. With <i>Blacc Hollywood</i>, Wiz has an easier time locating a pliable median between the varied whims of a fickle national audience than crafting a singular persona that draws them to him.</p></div>"|19751.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19751-wiz-khalifa-blacc-hollywood/|5.6|Craig Jenkins

To wit, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8887-merchandise/"">in a July 2012 interview with Pitchfork</a>, Carson Cox of Tampa post-punk outfit Merchandise offered up this definition of success: “There’s a new warehouse space called Cyborg City, where we just played an amazing show. There were a ton of fucking people there. There were, like, 70 fucking people.” Fast forward two years, and that same guy has just released an album that sounds like it was designed for stadium crowds of 70,000.</p>
<p>Of course, Merchandise are hardly the first punk-schooled band to eventually pursue loftier aspirations. But where many big-label debuts from former indie darlings often amount to putting lipstick on a pig, Merchandise are using their promotion to 4AD to, as Cox <a href=""http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-radar/merchandises-carson-cox-qa-bands-are-fucking-boring-and-stupid-and-dont-know-what-theyre-doing"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently put it to the <i>NME</i></a>, “start a new band with basically the same name.” And he’s not just talking about the group’s expansion from a drum-machined trio to a proper five-piece. Rather than nudge themselves toward the center by subtly sanding away the edges of their texturally dense art-pop epics, on <i>After the End</i>, Merchandise catapult themselves to the rightmost reaches of the dial, and, in the process, transform into their idea of what the archetypal mainstream rock band should be—which is actually so far off the mark from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F90Cw4l-8NY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">what mainstream rock actually is in 2014</a> that it positions Merchandise as far away from centrist pop-culture as they were when they were playing gigs in storage units.</p>
<p>Merchandise’s continually surprising evolution and capacity for challenging their core assumptions have mirrored those of another band of once-evasive hardcore exiles who have grappled with growing up and out of punk (and who are led by an outspoken frontman with a penchant for endlessly scrollable interviews): <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5160-fucked-up/"">Fucked Up</a>. Except instead of embracing 1970s rock-operatics, Merchandise have become greatly enamored with the Big Music of the mid-’80s and the buttoned-up college-rock of the early ’90s. (In retrospect, last year’s debut single for 4AD—the unwieldy 14-minute <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"">Spiritualized</a>-scaled behemoth “Begging for Your Life/In the City Light”—now feels like a last-gasp exorcism of their arty eccentricities.) On <i>After the End</i>, the band downplay their perennially fashionable <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"">Smiths</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"">Cure</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"">New Order</a> influences and tether themselves to more unabashedly populist signposts that have, thus far, proven resistant to hipster reclamation: Post-I.R.S. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"">R.E.M.</a>, pre-<i>Spirit of Eden</i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25136-talk-talk/"">Talk Talk</a>, the more meditative end of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3272-pearl-jam/"">Pearl Jam</a> canon.</p>
<p><i>After the End</i> is a record that is so determinedly mild-mannered, it essentially amounts to a declaration of war: against dominant notions of cool, the act of hiding your feelings behind a wall of noise, and the idea that anti-pop experimentation is inherently more noble and challenging a practice than writing a simple, emotionally direct love song. If the preceding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16918-children-of-desire/""><i>Children of Desire</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17895-merchandise-totale-nite/""><i>Totale Nite</i></a> saw Merchandise concealing their ever-irrepressible new-romantic hearts under thick layers of squawking saxophones, wailing harmonicas, and droning repetition, here they are laid bare and encased in brightly lit glass boxes like a gallery installation.</p>
<p>An album this guileless is bound to be polarizing, for the very fact that it resolutely resists the urge to provoke. (The tranquil opening instrumental “Corridor”—featuring, no shit, <i>wind chimes</i>—essentially functions as a citronella candle to ward off any indie ideologues lingering about from proceeding further.) But whether or not you accept Merchandise’s makeover, one thing is indisputable: This album sounds <i>fucking fantastic</i>. And remarkably, just like Merchandise’s previous releases, it’s a home recording. (Most of the band live together in the same house, Monkees-style.) But if much of <i>After the End</i> was laid down in Cox’s bedroom, it sounds like the band are performing a concert on the roof, absorbing the twinkle of the stars, the hum of crickets, the vapor trails of planes flying overhead, and the endless expanse of the sky above. The shimmering acoustic guitars sound like they have dew collecting on the strings; the smooth synth textures reflect the warm nocturnal glow of the city at night.</p>
<p>But like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs/"">the War on Drugs</a>’ recent <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19094-the-war-on-drugs-lost-in-the-dream/"">Lost in the Dream</a></i>, <i>After the End</i> chisels through the surface pleasures of baby-boomer-baiting soft-rock to coax out a deep-seated distress. When a once-volatile band slows down and cleans up its sound, it tends to signify that a certain degree of contentment has entered their lives—that past pressures and stressors have been cast aside and the ease into middle age has begun. <i>After the End</i>, however, highlights just how messy and painful that process can be, that severing ties with one’s past—whether it’s romantic partners, local music scenes, or entire belief systems—inevitably results in broken skin and frayed nerves.</p>
<p>Cox isn’t merely singing in a lower register for sexy-crooner effect; he sounds positively beaten down, as if a drowsy drawl is all he has the strength to muster after dealing with the fallout of his decisions. (As he sings on the lush and languorous “Looking Glass Waltz”: “Won’t someone please help me/ I’m too young to feel this old.”) And unlike previous Merchandise albums, he doesn’t allow himself the luxury of working out his frustrations through extended, cathartic hypno-rock jams: the seemingly easy-going jangle pop of “Enemy” fades out mid-verse, as if to suggest the tensions simmering within remain unresolved; the tightly wound “Little Killer” sounds the alarm for when <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-cD4oLk_D0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the light that’s never supposed to go out</a> starts to flicker.</p>
<p>At times, the disconnect between therapeutic function and clinical form is too vast to reconcile—the chipper, snap-along saunter of ""Telephone"" doesn't so much ease the anguish of waiting for an important call that never comes as conjure the dad-rock muzak you hear when your dentist's office puts you on hold. And the weight of all this anxiety and self-doubt starts to drag down the band—and the album—by the time we reach the penultimate title track, whose melodramatic, piano-pounded lurch neither erupts into chaos nor yields to ecstatic release. (“The sky is falling all around us,” Cox sings in his best Mark Hollis-ian moan, and the forecast doesn’t improve from thereon out.) But the beatific closing serenade “Exile and Ego” suggests Cox has found, if not inner peace, then at least the resolve to move on. “I ain’t no cowboy, I got no six guns,” Cox sighs, rejecting the outlaw mythology of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRvCvsRp5ho"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">another slick acoustic ballad about going it alone</a>. Because as <i>After the End</i> reminds us, the best way to disarm your adversaries isn’t with weapons—it’s by staring them right in the eye. </p></div>"|19663.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19663-merchandise-after-the-end/|7.0|Stuart Berman

In fact, if you don’t count reissues of the band’s 1980s albums, his acoustic output has nearly matched the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10127-beyond/"">three</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13109-farm/"">full-band</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17050-i-bet-on-sky/"">albums</a> that each justified the reunion and then some. Released in 2006, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11871-green-mind-where-you-been-j-mascis-live-at-cbgbs-the-first-acoustic-show/"">Live at CBGB’s: The First Acoustic Show</a></i> made stripping down for a legendary venue sound suitably punk, even if it remains the textbook definition of “For Fans Only.” Much more essential is <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15211-several-shades-of-why/"">Several Shades of Why</a> </i>from 2011, Mascis' first true solo album of new material, which featured mainly just Mascis and his Martin. It’s a quiet, gorgeous collection of fragile indie folk tunes made all the more powerful by his wounded-old-man croak, his dexterous picking, and his overall sense of restraint. And now there’s <i>Tied to a Star,</i> which picks up more or less where <i>Several Shades of Why </i>left off<i>.</i></p>
<p>In other words, we may be entering a new chapter in Mascis’ career, one where the Martin and the Jazzmaster receive equal play. This isn’t, thank god, a case of an aging musician making a last-ditch stab at mainstream success by turning self-consciously serious; these albums are still too weird for that. On the other hand, his acoustic material does sound relatively limited, as Mascis is not quite as expressive on the acoustic as he is on the electric. When he plugs in, he can bend notes into a language that is both new and familiar, conjugating active verbs from punk and metal, translating concrete nouns from blues and folk. He’s one of the few guitar gods whose technical prowess never sounds like an end in itself, but simply a means of getting his point across. Which is not to say that he doesn’t occasionally showboat, but that he showboats with great purpose.</p>
<p>When he unplugs, however, Mascis can be a little less communicative and compelling. <i>Several Shades of</i> <i>Why</i> worked because the setting emphasized his vocals and lyrics, both of which are occasionally drowned out by Dinosaur Jr.’s infamous din. Moreover, his playing showed a different approach to the instrument, as though he had relearned the guitar and devised new strategies to put his songs across. As a result, the music balanced a potent world-weariness with a new creative spark, and the songs succeeded precisely because they weren’t adequate vessels for the emotions he was trying to exorcise. It was a lovely, lonely album full of delicate melodies and tenderhearted, albeit somewhat elusive, sentiments.</p>
<p>By contrast, <i>Tied to a Star</i> lacks some of that album’s sense of discovery and precariousness. It’s much more confident and cagier, which may have to do with the fact that this isn’t strictly a Mascis solo record. He corralled a loose backing band for a four-man acoustic jam, including Pall Jenkins of the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/374-the-black-heart-procession/"">Black Heart Procession</a>, Ken Maiuri, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27999-mark-mulcahy/"">Mark Mulcahy</a>. Instead of lonely, quiet folk, we too often get strummy chumminess, which places <i>Star </i>uncomfortably close to ‘90s jam-band territory. The opening chords of “Every Morning” have a bouncy insistency that portends a Sister Hazel song, while the instrumental “Drifter” churns a vaguely Middle Eastern groove that might emanate from post-<i><a href=""http://youtu.be/Wg-HZd4Lb2Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jar of Flies</a></i> alt-rock radio.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s more to <i>Tied to a Star</i> than those questionable touchstones. Most of these songs hit the same vein as <i>Why</i>, framing Mascis’ singing and playing as idiosyncratic rather than anonymous. In fact, the best moments are those when he ditches the band altogether. “Come Down” underscores his gentle intro with a looming wall of distortion, as though reluctant to let the listener get too comfortable. Opener “Me Again” and “Stumble” showcase Mascis’ wounded-old-man vocals and especially his strong falsetto, serving as a good reminder that his voice has somehow gotten better with age. Over a quiet, spryly picked guitar theme, his voice meshes well with Marshall’s on “Wide Awake”, conjuring a lonely, late-night mood: two lovers on opposite ends of the telephone line. Only the intrusive crash cymbal on the bridge breaks the spell, but the song recovers on Mascis’ fluid guitar solo—which is played on electric, for what that’s worth.</p>
<p>In fact, almost all of the solos are electrified, which shows just how limited the Mascis + Martin set-up can be. He’s a figure of such towering goodwill in the indie world that it’s tempting to excuse or explain away his missteps. Certainly, <i>Tied to a Star</i> stumbles whenever the band sit in on a song, but his cohorts aren’t necessarily to blame. What’s truly disappointing about this uneven album is the fact that they could find no other mode of playing together besides the old, the familiar, and the unwelcome. There’s nothing embarrassing here, just a few miscalculations amid some typically strong material, <span>but Mascis has proven that he can muster more joyous ingenuity and imagination than he does on </span><i>Tied to a Star.</i></p></div>"|19532.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19532-j-mascis-tied-to-a-star/|6.4|Stephen Deusner

For a quarter-century, Mikael Åkerfeldt’s ever-amorphous set of Swedes has let the effort show with every sound, song, and surprising genre twist. At various points in Opeth’s career, their style has been categorized as progressive rock, death metal, or progressive metal, though each of those terms felt, at best, like undersized umbrellas for a band actively coercing bits of jazz, Romanticism, blues, British folk, pop, and new age into their musical madhouse. Opeth is so demanding that, a decade ago, they opted to issued two separate albums—the clenched <i>Deliverance</i> and the much more calm <i>Damnation</i>—rather than package them as an intended, insurmountable double album; still, sold separately, each half of the dichotomous pair broke or pushed the one-hour mark and twisted and turned with a maniacal and delightful zeal. Åkerfeldt’s work has never sounded unaffected or effortless; Opeth have, instead, worn labor and fastidiousness as badges of honor, open rebuttals to any sense of classical cool.</p>
<p>In turn, Opeth is one of modern music’s great paradoxes. They are one of the world’s most popular and enduring heavy acts, having charted every album they’ve made since <i>Damnation</i> in at least half-a-dozen countries. And their international following is a cult of often-unwavering allegiance. To wit, should you arrive at an Opeth show <a href=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8153/7375313442_bf9015d9a6_z.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>without </i>an Opeth shirt</a> printed in thick and vivid paint, you’ll find that the aforementioned code of cool has been temporarily reversed. Even among the faithful, though, the feeling that Opeth can be forced, overindulgent or obtuse is an abiding one; it is the baggage concomitant to the band’s audacity, the side effect of the quest to shoehorn a dozen things into ultra-dynamic metal. But that same effort enables one of Opeth’s greatest unifying assets: the overwhelming rush that their best music can provide, where a tizzy of elements sends the listener into a tailspin. Line up their catalog from one end to the other, press play, and be stunned by the number of moments (however calculated and meticulous they may be) where audience orientation vanishes. Their complications are their bait.</p>
<p>But <i>Pale Communion</i>, Opeth’s first album in three years, lacks the absolute willpower and prevailing ambition of the band’s best work—that is, the core that made the awkwardness sufferable. This is only the third album where Åkerfeldt foregoes his versatile death metal vocal delivery, following the path of 2011’s <i>Heritage</i> and 2003’s <i>Damnation</i>. He alternately supplants it instead with a singsong lilt, a folk-rock affability and an alt-rock theatricality. Notably, this is the first Opeth LP to arrive <a href=""http://www.stormcorrosion.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">since <i>Storm Corrosion</i></a>, Åkerfeldt’s 2012 full-length release with longtime collaborator Steven Wilson. Half of that album featured the London Session Orchestra, an influence that resurfaces throughout <i>Pale Communion</i>.</p>
<p>In fact, such strings web together the record’s two-song finale—and, really, the 16 minutes of music that save <i>Pale Communion</i> from abject disappointment. “Voice of Treason” is dramatic and lunging, with tumescent strings providing the ballast beneath the song’s seven-minute rise toward the thrall. Just ahead of the end, there’s a momentary blast beat, an enormous wash of strings, and a burst of heroic vocals from Åkerfeldt. “Have you ever seen the aftermath of giving up?” he howls, the band exploding around him. And the stately strings that sweep beneath closer “Faith in Others” are the platform from which Opeth lifts toward a post-rock surge. It dissipates slowly, as though the sound is being peeled apart layer by layer. Opeth surprises <i>and</i> engrosses here, ending this album better than they do most anything else.</p>
<p><i>Pale Communion</i> often feels too polite to overrun and too guarded to sustain Opeth’s familiar sense of total upheaval, where the listener struggles to remember which end is up and which way is forward. Take opener “Eternal Rains Will Come.” The song first weaves complicated rhythmic shifts against spools of sharp guitar and distorted organ, a compelling mix that suggests a florid spin on math-rock. But after a pause, the quintet springs ahead into a straight beat, flimsy funk dancing beneath quick harmonies cribbed from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMbuJXQCIvo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.""</a> The instruments coil again toward the end, with the guitar and drums pirouetting in sudden sync. But it’s a hyperactive soft-rock climax, an effete attempt to reach new heights.</p>
<p>Much the same holds for “Elysian Woes,” a trickle of acoustics backed by flute-like synthesizers  and led by Åkerfeldt in a rather miserable crooner guise. And “River” is the stiff Swedish approximation of fluid Southern guitar rock. Padded again by acoustic guitar and generous organ, the first half is more <a href=""http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=u4xp2lgiAjY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pure prairie league</a> than <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5XJDxe7TVY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Allman Brothers anthem</a>. But even the ricocheting instrumental midsection and spring-loaded coda feel preordained, like the very blatant ends of Opeth’s Southern rock trial. Likewise, “Goblin,” Opeth’s carousel-like horror score tribute, is as obvious as its name, while “Cusp of Eternity” implies Bono taking an acute, unfortunate interest in the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5A5aK33QR4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">power of djent guitars</a>. Even as it twists and turns through several solos, the destination feels fated, Opeth’s usual inexplicable intricacy given over to plug-and-play automation.</p>
<p>These arrivals of the expected are <i>Pale Communion</i>’s most damning symptom. In the past, Opeth have made their inspirations and aspirations obvious, but their avid recombinations suggested an array of infinite possibilities. Even if you couldn’t abide the inflexibility of their methodical grandeur, it was hard to condemn the immense effort and imagination involved. But <i>Pale Communion</i> only toys with the building blocks, revealing influences that were already apparent but refusing to invigorate them alongside each other. It’s not that Opeth isn’t cool here. It’s that these eight songs run cold on new energies and ideas, a rarity for a catalog custom-made to overwhelm.     </p></div>"|19520.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19520-opeth-pale-communion/|4.3|Grayson Haver Currin

<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Even though there's lots of references to be heard on <i>Bitchin Bajas</i>, very little of this record </span><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">sounds plagiaristic. It's almost like listening to the thought processes of Crain and bandmates Dan Quinlivan and Rob Frye, rather than what they think goes on in their heroes' minds. They manage this not despite their influences, but because of them; there are no gratuitous divergences, no forced curveballs to prove the trio aren’t stealing. Their blending of past musical personalities creates a new one, much the way a thoughtful cover can change your view of the original. Bitchin Bajas journey so far into their inspirations that they find something of their own inside.</span><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> </span></p>
<p><i>Bitchin Bajas </i>is largely comprised of long journeys. 18-minute opener “Tilang” could exist as a single release on its own, progressing from mournful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3935-stars-of-the-lid/"">Stars of the Lid</a>-like strings to rippling organs, whistling flutes, and harp-like glissandos. The way those sounds fold into each other recurs throughout the album, as the trio devise methods to make many voices (woodwinds, synths, xylophones) sing the same tune. The constant cross-dissolving can occasionally sound generic: “Field Study” opens with clichéd field recordings of water bubbling, birds chirping, and insects creaking. But even that piece resolves into something unique, as subtle beats make the music more about psychic relaxation than nature worship.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">Relaxation may seem an unambitious musical goal, but Bitchin Bajas are proud to chase it. Crain</span><a href=""http://adhoc.fm/post/cooper-crain-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> said</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> last year that “making music that is relaxing and comforting to us is important,” and the band even made a separate cassette version of </span><i>Bitchin Bajas </i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">dubbed </span><i>Relaxation Mixes </i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">that eliminates what they call “the intense peaks.”</span><i> </i><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">So naturally there’s little abandon on these two LPs; the trio only sound like they're losing control</span><span style=""font-size: 15px;""> during the overlapping synth squiggles of the 12-minute “</span><a href=""http://youtu.be/rgsghaoRxLk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bueu</a><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">”. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px;"">But Bitchin Bajas' relaxation plan works because they’re committed to it. There are no forced attempts at edginess, even though their simple techniques keep the music loose and live-sounding.

With older tracks like ""Jam Song"", they proved that they could ride a central groove while exploring different avenues; on <i>Underlay</i>, they find a similar balance between precise and unsteady. ""Hypocrite"" is a stellar example of this, as Rick Milovanovic's bass climbs and rollicks, consistently competing with the guitar for the spotlight. Meanwhile, drummer Alex Macfarlane (no relation to bandmate Julia) darts in several directions throughout the song, ramping up at the chorus and simmering toward the finish. The only time the band ever sound stagnant is on the instrumental title track, which is utilitarian—an unvarying two minutes, but a needed transition between ""Wait Til You Smile"" and ""Consecutive Seasons"". It's boring, and it bolsters the argument that Twerps are at their best when they stray from their set path.</p>
<p>If there's an MVP here, it's Julia, who sings the best two of the EP's eight songs. Her contributions are the most lyrically complex and melodically satisfying on the album; in the upbeat pop tune ""Conditional Report"", she notices a hole in the Flemish glass window, which is letting the wind into their house. ""How did we end up like this,"" she asks, maybe about the situation with their house, maybe about something bigger. ""Raft"" is deceptively heavy, considering its warm melody, using a raft in a flood as a potent image that alludes to anything from emotional tumult to straightforward survival. McFarlane's songs here are excellent examples of how this band can communicate so much with such a sparsely populated lyric sheet.</p>
<p>Lead singer Marty Frawley shares this talent: ""I'm just so damn sick/ I'm so sick of it all,"" he sings on <i>Underlay</i>'s closer ""Consecutive Seasons"", a line that underlines Twerps' skill at writing songs fraught with universal, emotionally familiar sentiments. Another line in ""Consecutive Seasons"", however, sounds more specific: ""And I don't want to sing <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLyJvKJGJGQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">'Dreamin'</a>/ It's lost every single meaning."" The line is a derisive namedrop of a highlight from 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15951-twerps-twerps/""><i>Twerps</i></a>, an album filled with lyrics inspired by the blossoming relationship between bandmates Frawley and Julia McFarlane—songs that Frawley <a href=""http://www.t-squat.com/twerps-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> left him feeling ""exposed."" On ""Consecutive Seasons"", Frawley sounds uncertain, discontent, and tired, a look that pairs well with the song's soft, bittersweet, jangling melody.</p>
<p>There's a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10202072929727447"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> that the band made last year to tease their next album where Frawley ""scolds"" each member of the band, telling them to get back to work and that they haven't ""earned"" their soft drinks. It's a funny video, but even though Frawley is game to send up serious notions of recording music, he and his band made a well-performed, well-written, focused statement on <i>Underlay</i>. </p></div>"|19724.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19724-the-twerps-underlay-ep/|7.4|Evan Minsker

By this point, the album has blown through more than ten percent of its running time with what is essentially a pair of introductions. The opening ""Workship"" offers two minutes of gleaming synthesizers streaming chemtrails of white noise; vast and cinematic, it suggests a three-way fusion of John Williams, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"">M83</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>. Then, ""A Glimpse"" materializes out of a mist of birdsong and running water, as carousel-like arpeggios accelerate and a sawtooth synth lead goes supernova. It's even more widescreen than the opener, but it still feels like a scene-setter rather than the main attraction. </p>
<p class=""p1"">That what makes what happens next feel so sneaky. The song fades out, and after near silence and another smattering of birdsong, there's a rumble like a gathering storm played back on fast-forward. And then, BOOM: an actual electric guitar! Shredding! It couldn't sound further from the Glasgow producer's wheelhouse, which is to say that it would be hard to think of a move more in line with his trickster's M.O. But before you can say, ""I hear you're throwing your computer out the window because you want to make something real; you want to make a Van Halen record,"" the joke, if that's what it is, is over. ""A Glimpse"" is presumably just that—a fleeting peek at a much stranger and more audacious record than <i>Green Language</i> ultimately turns out to be. </p>
<p class=""p1"">It's not entirely unsuccessful, not by any means; with some tweaks it could've been a great album. The Glasgow producer's chops have never sounded punchier, his synths never shinier or more serrated. Following his cock-rock feint, ""Raptor"" soars like a Kevlar-plated phoenix, synthesizer glissandi strafing all over the damn place, rat-a-tat 808 snares firing like a rivet gun. The light it throws off is dazzling; listen back to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15937-glass-swords/""><i>Glass Swords</i></a> and it suddenly sounds practically lo-fi in comparison. The sheer amount of sonic information he packs in is almost overwhelming: is that the sound of an alarm clock in the background, or just some kind of residual tinnitus ring from all those harmonics being piled on top of one another? And what's up with the angel cooing above it all?</p>
<p class=""p1"">When <i>Glass Swords</i> came out, Rustie's approach was so unfamiliar that the music was discussed primarily in terms of its impact—""maximalism,"" a term also applied to his peer Hudson Mohawke—and its texture. He helped us out with titles like ""Ice Tunnels"" and ""Crystal Echo"", not to mention those dazzling quartz obelisks on the cover—imagery that felt like a DMT-inspired mission to unlock the secrets of synaesthesia once and for all. But things are different now. The kinds of sounds he privileged on his debut album—'80s-inspired slap bass, hyperkinetic electro-funk, the lysergic riffs on Southern hip-hop that he termed ""aquacrunk""—have become popularized and re-naturalized. That last bit has become particularly true as the dubstep scene, the primary context in which Rustie was once considered, has cratered, its former practitioners gone looking for other styles to adapt or colonize.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Foremost among those is ""trap""; Rustie's dalliances with the form make him look more like a follower than a leader. Case in point: ""Attak"", a blistering number featuring the Detroit rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"">Danny Brown</a>. The tune's not without its charms, especially a synth lead that interpolates an echo of Duran Duran's ""Save a Prayer"" between Brown's marble-mouthed spray—and those machine-gun snares are a nice touch. But it feels like he's reaching for a hit, or at least a festival anthem, and the same could be said of ""Up Down"", featuring the grime rapper D Double E from Newham Generals, although at least the latter's wormhole bass and gamma-ray high-end are more in keeping with Rustie's usual methods. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The main issue with <i>Green Language</i> is that it feels scattered. ""He Hate Me"", featuring Gorgeous Children, is a fuzzy cloud-rap track with a beat that sounds like Rustie's mashing his fist on a home organ; after D Double E and Danny Brown's double-barreled bellows, the rappers' whispery voices fall flat, and the wind goes out of the album's sails. With ""Velcro"" we're suddenly plunged into a bewildering collision of Nintendo, Daft Punk, and trap; ""Lost"", featuring Numbers signee <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31530-redinho/"">Redinho</a>, is a talkbox-revival jam that aims for Zapp but hits closer to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/909-chromeo/"">Chromeo</a>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Just as the album begins with a succession of intros, as though opening up a set of Russian nesting dolls, it goes out with a series of alternate endings. The ecstatic R&amp;B of ""Dream On"" would have been an excellent place to finish, but ""Lets Spiral"", with its helicopter-rotor hi-hats and helium arpeggios, is essentially a companion piece to ""A Glimpse"", and the final song, ""Green Language"", is just 1:54 of underwater Windham Hill riffing laced, once again, with running water and birdsong. There's nothing wrong with Rustie's ambient abstractions; they may be structurally slight, but they pack a surprisingly powerful emotional wallop. Ultimately, though, you get the sense that he can't decide between two competing visions: that of the festival-anthem trap lord, and the new age cosmonaut. The battle that ensues is exhilarating and frustrating in equal measure: as a producer, Rustie's skills are in top form. But instead of the epic hero he wants to be, he's tilting at glass windmills.</p></div>"|19610.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19610-rustie-green-language/|7.2|Philip Sherburne

But that's the case for just about anything compared to the mindbending pop-house they'd concoct throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s. <i>Remedy</i>, <i>Rooty</i>, and <i>Kish Kash</i> made for such a definitive early-career run that their overloaded, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24089-frankie-knuckles/"">Frankie Knuckles</a>-via-Tex Avery sensibility shone through even when they felt like they were starting to coast. Theirs was a sound that could find a context for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5439-siouxsie-sioux/"">Siouxsie Sioux</a> and J.C. Chasez on the same record, hopping between indie-kid nods and marquee pop dreams in a way that highlighted just how across-the-board house music and its offspring could be. Even when 2009 releases <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13519-scars/""><i>Scars</i></a> and the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13857-zephyr-ep/""><i>Zephyr </i></a>EP threatened to tone them down, there was always an ambush around the corner, like the offbeat engagement with grime and dubstep on their masterful score for 2011 sci-fi cult classic <i>Attack the Block</i>.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">But house, garage, and bass music are currently crowded with new-gen acts that owe a lot of their appeal, acknowledged or otherwise, to Jaxx's precedent of sweat-flinging cartoon intensity. And with the records they dropped five years back already hinting at a long goodbye to bombast, Ratcliffe and Buxton seem content to let their heirs pick up the slack, as Jaxx themselves ease into restraint on <i>Junto</i>. This new album's a strange one, albeit in the sense that it's not really strange at all: the closest there is to a left-field guest is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30309-mykki-blanco"">Mykki Blanco</a>, whose one verse is played twice on the two-and-a-half-minute ""Buffalo""—and if you cut out that track's fleeting hit of scattered d'n'b mayhem, <i>Junto</i> is easily Basement Jaxx's most conservatively minded full-length.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Sure, this album is still recognizably theirs at points. The boogie-shuffle ""We Are Not Alone"" has some characteristically anarchic burbling squelches trickling through its boogie-shuffle churn. ""What's the News"" gathers together gelatin-cube bass, dizzy synth chirps, and bongo breaks into the kind of dub-disco cruise that would've fit in nicely in the back half of <i>Remedy</i>. There are still signs of jet-set eclecticism that incorporates pan-Latin salsa/bossa (""Mermaid of Salinas""), UK Afro-Caribbeanisms (the Shakka feature ""Rock This Road""), and slickly diced-up '80s funk (""Summer Dem""). And the vocalists, while mostly semi-obscure outside dance music circles, are almost uniformly powerful—with special credit to Meleka, whose surprise-star lead turn on ""We Are Not Alone"" packs a sly passion that she hinted at while harmonizing with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2357-kelis/"">Kelis</a> on <i>Scars</i>' title track. It's a fundamentally sound record as well as one that's easy to move to, never content to stay in one place for too long but not all that scattershot when it comes to going off the experimental deep end.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>But let's face it—Basement Jaxx is not a group that's at their best when they just bear down and focus on the fundamentals. Even when <i>Junto</i> showcases them at their best—that'd be the knockout ""Unicorn,"" which is both the liveliest single on the record and their most shameless vintage house throwback since ""Do Your Thing""—the sense of adventure is missing. It's a point-missing exercise to shrug at </span><span>lyrics, </span><span>of all things, when it comes to dance music—but when there's a precedent of hooks like ""I'm too far gone, I've gone too far"", ""Don't let the walls cave in on you"", and ""Ain't nothin' goin' on but history/ But it's alright, don't panic"" lending an untethered mania to earlier Jaxx classics, the titular refrains of ""Power to the People"" and ""Never Say Never"" are relatively lacking in that giddy sense of control loss. And without all the deliberate craziness and cluttered what-next noise that always threatened to overload those jams, what's left, while still danceable and upbeat, seems a little trad. Now more than ever, there needs to be something blatantly neon-bright and iconoclastic enough to offset all the midtempo, gloomy sad-boy house that's thrown current sound systems a bit out of whack. And while </span><i>Junto </i><span>is at least happy enough to lift spirits, it feels like they've left it to others to reintroduce anarchy to the dancefloor.</span></p></div>"|19746.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19746-basement-jaxx-junto/|6.5|Nate Patrin

It’s one of the blueprints for what would eventually (and often reductively) become the post-punk aesthetic of goth, and Brighton-based trio the Wytches have gulped down that influence greedily on their debut album, <i>Annabel Dream Reader</i>. The record is swamped in menace, murk, and star-crossed heartbreak. Singer/guitarist/organist Kristian Bell has a vision, and it isn’t a bright one; along with drummer Gianni Honey (whom Bell played with in the rickety, charming <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImrCdkc4I8w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Crooked Canes</a>) and bassist Daniel Rumsey, The Wytches’ frontman cloaks himself in gloom. Beneath the trench coat, though, beats a love of grainy garage-punk, slapback-echoing surf-rock, and schoolyard-strength psychedelics. </p>
<p><i>Annabel Dream Reader </i>is a monster-mashup of atmospheric proportions, and that works to their benefit, at least musically. “Beehive Queen” is a fetching shambles of a song, teeming with subaquatic twang and Bell singing in a strange, psychosexual vibrato. “Crying Clown” flirts with stoner-rock heaviness; “Weights and Ties” border on power balladry. There isn’t that much of a dynamic inherent in the Wytches’ hybridized sound, but they maximize it. “Wide at Midnight” is a study in tangles and tendrils, full of little melodic licks and abrupt bursts of distortion and screams. Bell is an erratic songwriter, and that works in his favor; what could have easily been a myopic, compromised mess is actually a grab-bag of unhinged sonic surprises.</p>
<p>Bell’s lyrics, on the other hand, are more painstakingly considered—although maybe they shouldn’t have been. <i>Annabel Dream Reader </i>is a concept album, but the plot is as loosely formed as most concept albums, consisting mostly of repeated themes, linked images, and recurring characters. In that regard, the record mostly works; its arc—from ill-fated introduction to tragic epilogue—is solid, even if it adds little to the experience of actually listening to it. Where Bell falls flat is on the lyric sheet itself. Too much of it reads like a parody of notebook-scrawled, adolescent anguish,  if not flat-out doggerel. “I know you and I took the last of the light/ From a bulb that resembled a tear,” he sneers with metaphor-mangling glee on “Digsaw”. “Keep away from this active breeding/Of dogs like men of masculinity,” he all but babbles on “Wide at Midnight”, lines that transcend cringe-inducement, to the point where your brain might go on strike after hearing them. </p>
<p>The lowest lyrical point is “Fragile Male for Sale”— a song whose title alone is a linguistic misdemeanor— which proudly features the line, “You must be a dancer 'cause you’re dancing in me”. If that doesn’t reek enough of Moleskins and cloves, Bell goes on to inject “Summer Again” with bombs like “I undid your dress/ You climbed up my jeans/ We wept for each other.” He seems to be shooting for the mystique-soaked romanticism of one of his obvious idols, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4638-jack-white/"">Jack White</a>—the album was recorded by Liam Watson at London’s Toe Rag Studios, the producer and room behind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"">the White Stripes</a>’ <i>Elephant</i>— but this is some strictly <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqKJO6yO7Nw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aiden</a>-level cliché-craft. “Track 13” is the album’s final song, and its final line is “Stop reading me, Annabel”. If Bell were ribbing himself about how wretched his lyrics are, it’d at least be amusing, but that might be giving him too much credit. </p>
<p>Of course, Bell’s lyrics aren’t intended solely to be read off the page; they’re meant to be listened to with full accompaniment, and in that sense, he’s almost able to compensate for his own handicap. “Burn Out the Bruise” is built on a dark, whiplash drone as well as Bell’s spirited, mid-exorcism caterwauling; it’s enough to overshadow the fact that he’s singing drivel like “Your claws slipped through like I was made out of glue/ But it wasn't enough to help you burn out the bruise.” That spirit is the key to the album’s charm; the Wytches’ willingness to hurl caution to the wind is exhilarating, even when it verges on the precious and cartoonish. Outclassed by their own ambition, the band has aimed <i>Annabel Dream Reader</i> toward the lofty heights of Poe’s glum, fog-shrouded majesty—and winds up hitting, at best, late-period Tim Burton.</p></div>"|19572.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19572-the-wytches-annabel-dream-reader/|5.8|Jason Heller

Their releases are compartmentalized into a tier somehow less important than a full-length, treated as mere precursors to something bigger and better; they face pressure to translate their art into the ironclad LP format, and to satisfy general expectations of what an album is supposed to be. So pity <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28700-dark-sky/"">Dark Sky</a>, because they are, at the least, three consistent 12"" producers who had little choice but to issue their first full-length five years into a respectable career built solely on short-form records.</p>
<p>Carlo Anderson, Matthew Benyayer, and Thomas Edwards are among the few remaining vestiges of UK bass music, 2009's cryptic genre tag meant to encompass dubstep, house, and techno ideas via their most physical frequencies. After originators like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28029-joy-orbison/"">Joy Orbison</a> and the Night Slugs camp gradually shifted focus to singular elements of the hybridized genre, Dark Sky continued to hone their knack for hyperreal sound design and rattling subs well into 2013. It wasn't until the <i>In Brackets</i> EP, which saw release on Mister Saturday Night in April of last year, that the trio seemed at all interested in a less aggressive palette. From <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15644-in-brackets/"">the title track</a> on down, this iteration of Dark Sky took a moodier, contemplative, and even jazzy approach to bass-loaded soundsystem music—an exciting growth spurt for a group whose only moments of reflection ever materialized in the passing seconds before a massive drop. Dark Sky were broadening their horizons, gracefully.</p>
<p>An extensive and reliable discography like Dark Sky's is entirely why <i>Imagin</i>, their debut album for the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2978-modeselektor/"">Modeselektor</a>-helmed Monkeytown label, should work—but it's also entirely why it doesn't. The three producers have sidestepped their natural upward trajectory in exchange for some of the riskiest and most predictable moves an established electronic artist can make on the first LP. Needless, anticlimactic intro? Check. Uninspired vocal tracks? Check. Shoehorned pandering to longtime fans? Check. Tepid flirtations with previously unexplored genres? Check. Between scattered glimpses of what made these producers worth keeping tabs on, <i>Imagin</i> falters because it sounds like Dark Sky second guessed their strengths in the face of delivering an album on someone else's terms.</p>
<p>In contrast, <i>Imagin</i> shines whenever it isn't contorting to fit preconceived notions of format. After two false starts, ""Voyages"" breathes life into the tracklist with its percussive clatter and slippery synth acrobatics, sounding like the best possible outtake from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"">Four Tet</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18649-four-tet-beautiful-rewind/""><i>Beautiful Rewind</i></a> sessions. Brawny banger ""Odyssey""—a spacious, electro-slanted production that has been floating around since 2012—reclaims your attention after ""Lucid"", ""Vivid"", and ""Nothing Changes"" spend 10-plus minutes meandering between placid trip-hop references and narcotic electronica. These scattered resurgences aren't weakened by the valleys that bookend them, but Dark Sky's fleeting moments of clarity make for a record which feels like two-thirds setup and one-third delivery.</p>
<p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-e82a6678-ef01-a399-8795-8c6c884eb977""><span>""Manuka"" epitomizes the largest issue at the core of </span><i>Imagin</i><span>. Donning snappy drums and a snaking bassline, the track is easily among the record's strongest moments; with a little editing, it could go blow for blow with past heavy hitters like ""Zoom"" and ""Shades"". But right in the middle of Dark Sky's slick, well-calibrated tune is a pitch-shifted vocal sample mucking about like a scratched disco 45 spinning 12 RPMs too slow. It's a gratuitous bit of production work that cheapens ""Manuka"" whenever it appears, and this practice of garnishing perfectly capable songs with mismatched bells &amp; whistles—that is, pursuing a supposedly mature sound through indistinguishable singers and superficial lyrics—bogs down music that would otherwise thrive on its dynamic structure and engaging sound design.</span></span></p></div>"|19614.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19614-dark-sky-imagin/|5.9|Patric Fallon

It was a prelude to <i>Canto Secondo</i>, the trio’s superior second album. Where <i>La Busta Gialla</i> was made over long stretches of time, and almost entirely across long distances, by a band that started recording only a week into its existence, <i>Canto Secondo </i>flaunts an ease and familiarity that can only come through collaboration and experience, not to mention proximity. The bulk of <i>Canto Secondo</i> was recorded with all three members in the same room at the same time, and it shows in tracks like the instrumental “Alain”, with its lopsided prog ambulation propped up by Watt’s melted-rubber low-end, and “Mountain Top”, a circular, gently jangled meditation that has the feel of a post-punk koan.</p>
<p>“Sailor Blues” is <i>Canto Secondo</i>’s longest track, and at a trim five-minutes-plus, it demonstrates just how concentrated and concise the trio’s internal language has become. From Pilia’s knotty yet fluid guitar lines to Watt’s punching, dancing bass, the song descends into an ethereal wash of soft-focus distortion and playfully unresolved bends of melody. The touchstones become more sharply defined on “Us in Their Land”; in a start-stop fit of squealing virtuosity that anxiously mashes <i>My War</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/"">Black Flag</a> into <i>Starless and Bible Black</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2297-king-crimson/"">King Crimson</a>, the song hastily builds a scaffolding, clambers up it, then pulls it out from under its feet. Pilia’s whispery, heavily accented poetry not only clicks, it evokes a strange kind of dreamy menace, working strictly on a level of phonetic atmosphere. </p>
<p>The problem with any musicians Watt might pick up, here and in the future, is that they’re drawn to Watt because of his legacy, and rightly so. But that also means they’re playing in his shadow, and that they’re fans first and foremost—which can lead to songs like “Animal Farm Tango”. “Humans are not welcome in the sick animal farm tango,” Watt recites in a gravelly, avuncular, spoken-word segment as dry as post-apocalyptic dust, sounding for all the world like Allen Ginsberg on The Clash’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raGsgsuPFAw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Ghetto Defendant”</a>. The music itself, though, is reminiscent of something much closer to home: the Minutemen’s <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_MhC4mQaGc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Do You Want New Wave Or Do You Want the Truth?”</a>, all fluttery notes and swaying spaces. But <i>Canto Secondo</i>’s strength is in its effortless balance between Watt’s formidable past and his still potent future. Better yet, that balance feels instinctual, and at times downright spiritual. <i>Il Sogna del Marinaio</i> may not have come anywhere near Watt’s formative bands in terms of sheer songwriting, or the ability to rattle the heart and mind—but on <i>Canto Secondo</i>, they’ve settled into a groove that’s taken on the gabby pattern of a classic Watt spiel.</p></div>"|19651.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19651-mike-watt-il-sogno-del-marinaio-canto-secondo/|6.5|Jason Heller

Whether it’s the sad-eyed garage-rock of the 2011 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15557-goodbye-bread/""><i>Goodbye Bread</i></a>, the scorching psych-punk of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16744-slaughterhouse/"">Slaughterhouse</a> </i>from 2012<i>,</i> or the acoustic stoner reveries of last year’s <i>Sleeper</i>, the increasingly narrow windows between Segall’s discrete releases seemingly inspire him to knuckle down and fully inhabit a specific aesthetic before conquering the next one. It’s hard to feel overwhelmed by the vast amount of material he releases, because each new album has revealed a different facet of both his sound and personality, and built up anticipation for where he might go next. </p>
<p>With <i>Manipulator</i>, Segall arrives at his own personal promised land, the place where all the divergent paths he’s travelled intersect. As Segall has revealed in interviews, <i>Manipulator</i> represents the inevitable pause from his usual breakneck pace, its 17-song, double-album sprawl the product of an unprecedented (for him) 14-month writing process. You can feel that extra attention to detail on every song here: In sharp contrast to his previous album-to-album (or, in the case of 2012’s grab-bag <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17133-twins/""><i>Twins</i></a>, track-to-track) stylistic shifts, the songs of <i>Manipulator</i> represent a perfect melting-pot synthesis of Segall’s many sonic signatures, as if each component—from the British Invasion-inspired melodies to the glam-rock affectations to the berserker guitar solos—was carefully measured out in beakers and test tubes before being mixed together. “He’s going to make a movie/ Of his entire life,” Segall sings on the gritty acoustic groover “Green Belly”, and even if he’s not referring directly to <i>Manipulator</i>’s career-spanning breadth, he certainly embraces auteur theory here, playing pretty much all of the instruments himself. (His trusty <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30374-ty-segall-band/"">Ty Segall Band</a> appears together on just one track.) </p>
<p><i>Manipulator</i> sticks within a clearly demarcated comfort zone—i.e., the turn-of-the-’70s classic-rock canon spanning <i>The Who Sell Out</i> to <i>Raw Power</i>—but manages to touch upon every significant development in rock ‘n’ roll during that period. Want string-swept Bolan-esque serenades? Meet “The Singer”. <span>A glitter-smeared proto-punk face-melter? Check “It's Over”.</span> Jeff Beck-era Yardbirds mod-rock romps? Keep it real with “The Faker”. Ornate <i>Forever Changes</i>-worthy psych-folk? You can’t beat “The Clock”. A Grand Funk'd boogie that yields a drum-banging breakdown <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld228IoU8aE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m27s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">just like the one on Rod Stewart’s version of the Temptations’ “(I Know) I’m Losing You”</a>? Get your fill with “Feel”. But perhaps the most pervasive influence of all is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/438-david-bowie"">David Bowie</a> circa <i>The Man Who Sold the World</i>—not just in Segall’s fanciful, faux-Brit diction (a quality he shares with his equally effete pal Tim Presley, aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28957-white-fence/"">White Fence</a>), but in the way he welds electric shredding to percussive acoustic underpinnings, with the stripped-down strut of “Tall Skinny Lady” and “The Clock” bringing to mind the Bowie/Ronson match-ups on “Black Country Rock” and “Width of a Circle”.</p>
<p>And yet, even though his musical frame of reference is fixated upon an era that began 20 years before he was born, Segall is very much consumed by modern problems. As to be expected from someone who hasn’t updated their Twitter account in three months, <i>Manipulator</i> takes a skeptical view of technocracy, its lyrics dotted with allusions to surveillance, privacy invasion, identity theft, and TV addiction. In this light, the album’s acoustic/electric symbiosis feels emblematic of the tug-of-war between old-world authenticity and new-world convenience playing out in Segall’s head. (As if the aforementioned “Feel” doesn’t make his preference for IRL connections explicit enough, he answers it with another song called “The Feels”.) Of course, like any tried ‘n’ true garage-rocker, Segall still has girl trouble on his mind—but, in this case, it’s trouble with a girl addicted to her devices named, natch, “Susie Thumb”.  </p>
<p>With its fuzzed-out Kinksian hooks, “Susie Thumb” is an obvious choice for <i>Manipulator</i>’s lead single—and, really, they could all be singles here. But that’s a comment on both Segall’s consistent craftsmanship and the songs’ very similar sense of scale, the latter of which ultimately prevents <i>Manipulator</i> from becoming the career-crowning milestone its protracted gestation period suggested. <i>Manipulator </i>may be 50 percent longer than the average Ty Segall record, but it doesn’t always make the case that it <i>had</i> to be. The issue isn’t song quality so much as a flattened topography: Whether they emphasize regal violins or squealing leads, the tunes here are pitched at the same cruising altitude and rarely upset their steady, maraca-massaged choogle. As such, <i>Manipulator</i> feels less like an epic Side-A-to-Side-D journey and more like an hour-long CD that would benefit from some editing (particularly when the songs start to feel like dopplegangers of one another—see: “The Crawler” vs. “It’s Over”). <span>As his red-hot, silver-lipsticked recent appearance on </span><i>Conan</i><span> proved, Segall is ready for prime time. However, the ample generosity of </span><i>Manipulator</i><span> highlights the cruel paradox of showbiz: When you give the people everything they want, you can’t leave them wanting more.</span></p></div>"|19668.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19668-ty-segall-manipulator/|7.8|Stuart Berman

He’s proved himself the rare artist capable of placing these sounds into more outre contexts without sacrificing any of their ferociousness. His last album, 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12000-london-zoo/""><i>London Zoo</i></a>, was full of menacing, fevered ragga that helped make explicit the connections between dancehall, grime, and the still-burgeoning dubstep scene. It was an album that proved especially enlightening to non-UK audiences, putting a point on several elusive trends. He returns here with <i>Angels &amp; Devils</i>, an album that retains the precise brutality of <i>London Zoo</i> but feels labored in comparison.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Martin works slowly in genres that move quickly, and <i>Angels &amp; Devils</i> arrives as grime has once again taken root as both a commercial and underground force: <i>London Zoo</i> all-star <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19706-flowdan/"">Flowdan</a> can now be heard regularly on stations like Rinse FM toasting over mixes by DJs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19348-elijah-and-skilliam-fabriclive-75/"">Elijah &amp; Skilliam</a>, while newcomers like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeIVojRQCLw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">My Nu Leng</a> offer potent blasts. Dubstep is...well, no one really knows what dubstep is in 2014. Dancehall persists, perhaps juiced a little by a generation of adoring rappers. Martin is unconcerned. <i>Angels &amp; Devils</i>, an uneven collection, continues to skew dancehall toward the vanguard of British electronic music, extending an artistic handshake that’s been in effect for more than 20 years (and longer, should you want to move past electronic music).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">On <i>Angels &amp; Devils</i>, Martin bifurcates his interests, offering six songs of muddy dirges and six tracks of raucous, MC-aided bangers that will be familiar to fans of <i>London Zoo</i>. Presenting oneself as two competing forces is an artistic gambit that runs roughly from Ancient Greek theatre through <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7825-nelly/"">Nelly</a>'s <i>Sweat/Suit</i>, and <i>Angels &amp; Devils</i> slides comfortably between those poles. The problem is that Martin divides the album exactly, offering first six slow cuts—""angels"", presumably—and then the ruffneck ""devil"" cuts. As a conceit, it fails, stultifying the album's flow and <span>condescending to listeners regarding Martin's range</span>: of course he's capable of slower, foggier productions, but did anyone think <i>London Zoo</i> needed more ambient passages?</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Of course, slo-mo, waterlogged ephemera—be it dusty takes on R&amp;B or traipsing down dub’s ever-expanding wormhole—is a pervasive trend in current British electronic music, leading to a lot of limp-wristed trip-hop variations. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"">Grouper</a>’s Liz Harris opens the album with “Void”, her airy, tip-toeing vowels as far as you can get stylistically from Flowdan without phoning Josh Groban. Martin’s lurching bass and gunmetal snares threaten, and Harris proceeds unaffected, <span>as neither artist knows what to do with the other</span>. Gonjasufi, meanwhile, sounds all too comfortable on “Save Me”, offering up the kind of moaning, industrial balladry you might find on a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars/"">Liars</a> album. It's not all bad: avant-chanteuse <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32295-copeland/"">Copeland</a>'s lemon-sucking croon is fine foil for Martin’s bass rattle, and Miss Red proves that even on softer material, a Jamaican patois bests offsets Martin’s bouts of heavy, as she turns “Mi Lost” into a sonorous sendup.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The album’s second half is more familiar, and better. We’re treated again to three Flowdan cuts, and once again the combination of Martin’s fury and Flowdan’s resonant basso proves potent. Flowdan sounds good saying almost literally anything, and he delivers the occasional quotidian detail—“Why don’t my wife even like me?”—in the same confident bluster as his threats, which is both sneaky and funny. Manga, a bit more histrionic, turns the wild, splintering square waves of “Function” into the record’s best banging-on-the-dash party. In this context, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29614-death-grips/"">Death Grips</a>, who growl menacingly on “Fuck a Bitch”, sound stiff (and they always sound atonal).</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Still, these tracks surge, bleeding adrenaline: Martin sows chaos and his collaborators keep things just under control. When the tempo and aggression are dialed back, the dynamic turns; Martin’s still a talented sound designer, but the whipping, centrifugal force that binds his tracks together is missing. That force is largely absent for the first six songs of <i>Angels &amp; Devils</i>, and the album is trying as a result. The ruff cuts that close the album are your reward, and they are as rattled and rattling as ever, proving Martin still has a deft touch with the underground, provided the underground gives him something to work with.</p></div>"|19742.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19742-the-bug-angels-devils/|6.7|Andrew Gaerig

But, coming from her, the line is as much proud affirmation as it is grave prognostication—because it’s precisely the kind of purgatory she calls home. The music of Cold Specks exists somewhere between log-cabin warmth and wintry forest chill, between exquisite elegance and raw release, between young compulsion and old-soul wisdom. And this ambiguity extends to Spx herself: she has the kind of voluminous voice that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGTh77WvjVg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">can fill an entire church without the aid of a microphone</a>, but she’s not one for the showboating theatrics of the pulpit. (For all the Southern Baptist allusions her music inspires, she’s actually a lapsed Muslim.) And yet her adoption of an alias suggests a certain appreciation for artifice, and reminds us that we shouldn’t confuse the in-your-face intimacy of her songs for autobiography. </p>
<p>Of all the evocative words in the title of Cold Specks’ 2012 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16561-cold-specks-i-predict-a-graceful-expulsion/""><i>I Predict a Graceful Expulsion</i></a>, the most telling was “predict.” That album heralded the emergence of a striking talent with immense potential, but you also got the sense that Spx was being extra-cautious and meticulous on her maiden foray, and that the real fireworks would come once she got more comfortable as both a bandleader and spotlight-conditioned singer. <i>Neuroplasticity</i> is an encouraging next step towards that, but it’s not so much Spx that’s changed as her backing band, who seem less like they’re respectfully following their frontwoman’s lead as forcefully unleashing the simmering tension that’s always been an undercurrent in her work. </p>
<p>Of course, hanging out with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"">Swans</a> helps. <i>Neuroplasticity </i>is another summit for the mutual-appreciation society that was forged when Cold Specks covered Swans’ “Reeling the Liars In” for a 2012 Record Store Day EP, earning Michael Gira’s endorsement in the process. Spx’s recent guest appearance on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19326-swans-to-be-kind/""><i>To Be Kind</i></a> was actually her returning the favor for Gira’s two previously recorded cameos on <i>Neuroplasticity</i>, which aren’t so much showcase turns as demonic possessions, his unmistakably grim tones quietly echoing Spx’s lyrics on the roiling “Exit Plan” and the cabaret-ballad creeper “A Season of Doubt” like an inner voice instructing her to do terrible things. At 35 minutes total, <i>Neuroplasticity</i> is only 43 seconds longer than <a href=""http://grooveshark.com/#!/s/Bring+The+Sun+Toussaint+L+Ouverture/6R9jP8?src=5"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Swans song Spx lent her voice to</a>, but the band’s specter hangs over the record like the blackest of clouds, infecting everything from the diseased Dixieland squawks of the opening “A Broken Memory”, to the climactic, mallet-swinging crashes of “Old Knives” to the foghorn-powered, percussive thrust of “Absisto”. The result is the most captivating music Spx has produced to date, made all the more so by the authoritative poise she projects in even the most calamitous surroundings. Her cryptic yet commanding words comfort and unsettle in equal measure—after all, this is a singer who can deliver a line like “all I got is love and grace” with the same clear-eyed conviction as “I smother with you with silence until you choke on dead air.”</p>
<p>However, even within a compact 10-song set that sees her boldly bolstering her sound, <i>Neuroplasticity</i> encounters pacing problems that undermine its mission. In particular, the trio of tracks that comprise the album’s mid-section—“A Quiet Chill”, “Exit Plan”, and “Let Loose the Dogs”—sees Spx lock into familiar melodic and structural patterns, tackling an opening hymn-like verse with minimal accompaniment before the booming drums kick in to send the chorus aloft with clockwork proficiency. Even the refreshingly anomalous “Bodies at Bay”—which introduces a gliding motorik rhythm that will endear Spx all the more to her <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/475-broken-social-scene/"">Broken Social Scene</a> bosses at her Canadian label, Arts &amp; Crafts—ultimately halts its spirited momentum for a slow, swaying, skyward chorus, as if walling Spx back into a comfort zone that much of this record makes great strides in dismantling. The takeaway here is that, two albums in, Cold Specks have the graceful part down pat—but there’s room for more expulsion.</p></div>"|19521.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19521-cold-specks-neuroplasticity/|7.4|Stuart Berman

It’s not clear which connotation Robyn Hitchcock might have been shooting for when he titled his new album <i>The Man Upstairs</i>—after all, he’s no stranger to either <a href=""http://www.allmusic.com/song/where-do-you-go-when-you-die-mt0030509394/lyrics"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">religion</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFQcANdb6E0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">animation</a>—but it’s likely there’s no overarching theme at play here. The veteran post-punk folksinger has assembled 10 songs, half of them covers, that don’t seem to mesh in any way other than the fact Hitchcock is singing them.</p>
<p>The first time I saw Hitchcock live was in 1996, when he was splitting a solo acoustic tour with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/449-billy-bragg"">Billy Bragg</a>. Hitchcock’s set was striking, and not just because of the flagrant contrast he and Bragg were gleefully milking: one the whimsical troubadour, the other the craggy firebrand. The two, of course, have more in common than that reductive binary would have you believe, but Hitchcock stood out in one clear, shining way: He’s not just a storyteller, but a shaggy-dog raconteur, as well as a chatty chap who’s more than happy to weave his songs (and those of others) in and out of lengthy tangents and stream-of-consciousness palavering.</p>
<p>In that sense, <i>The Man Upstairs</i> is much like a Hitchcock gig: it meanders, and it has a lovely time doing so. “Trouble in Your Blood” is a study in fragility, all feathery strumming and tentative cello. If it has a vaguely <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1143-nick-drake/"">Nick Drake</a>-esque aura, that’s because the album is produced by Joe Boyd, famous for his work on <i>Five Leaves Left</i> and <i>Bryter Layter</i>, as well as everyone from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"">Pink Floyd</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5731-fairport-convention/"">Fairport Convention</a>. But Hitchcock’s voice is his own: nasal and astringent, the polar opposite of Drake’s, but no less melodic or emotive on tracks like “Comme Toujours”, which sports sharper, fingerpicked guitar beneath Hitchcock’s charmingly lopsided French. “I’m not trying to be clever,” he sings, and he makes it sound like the cleverest lyric ever uttered.</p>
<p>The album’s cover songs fare just as well. In Hitchcock’s hands, “To Turn You On”—one of the most starry-eyed tracks from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6054-roxy-music/"">Roxy Music</a>’s <i>Avalon</i>—into a less languid, more quietly urgent plea. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5036-the-doors/"">The Doors</a>’ “The Crystal Ship” is the closest <i>The Man Upstairs</i> comes to psychedelia (in other words, not very), and for a singer-songwriter who once repurposed psychedelic music so cannily, it’s an unsatisfying glimpse into what the album might have sounded like with a lusher, fleshier approach—not to mention a more developed idea behind it.</p>
<p>Boyd’s production is subtle, soft, and breathy throughout <i>The Man Upstairs</i>, but for such a notable studio legend, he doesn’t bring much to the table besides that. His pairing with Hitchcock is a matchup that practically oozes masterpiece potential, only here it seems squandered on a set of songs that feel like breezy throwaways. <i>The Man Upstairs</i>’ best track is Hitchcock's version of the Psychedelic Furs’ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52DUrv1gCUw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“The Ghost in You”</a> that manages to extract far more of a haunted atmosphere from the song than the band who wrote it, great as they are, ever did.</p>
<p>Then again, Hitchcock has <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGVOx7NQPM4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=50s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a thing for ghosts</a>, and it’s indicative of his knack for interpreting other artists, and storytelling in general, that he’s able to funnel his own obsessions through songs he didn’t compose. Here, though, it's simply not enough. Hitchcock has stated that he loves <i>The Man Upstairs </i>because it’s not “just another singer-songwriter laying their freshest eggs,” but with Boyd at the controls—and Hitchcock at the mic—that’s exactly what this album could and maybe should have been. <i>The Man Upstairs</i> has warmth and charm galore, but it needs someone, anyone, reaching down to more strongly pull the strings.</p></div>"|19573.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19573-robyn-hitchcock-the-man-upstairs/|6.3|Jason Heller

As electronic dance music has increased in mainstream popularity, the dominant force has been vertical: the drop, the fist-pump, the collective leap in the air, the <a href=""http://www.beatmyday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Swedish-House-Mafia5.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">upstretched finger</a>, the meteoric rise of the superstars themselves. DJ sets play out like roller coasters, a succinct succession of tension-building ascents and sudden, precipitous plunges.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But not all dance music works like this. Techno, for instance, typically has placed far more emphasis on the horizontal plane, with long, gradual crossfades lending the illusion of a seamless and endless continuity, and extreme repetition furthering a sense of stasis-in-movement. That's particularly true of the kind of techno associated with Berlin's Berghain club, and it's even truer of Marcel Dettmann, one of Berghain's best-known residents. His productions and his DJ sets alike are less like a rollercoaster than a landscape of gently rolling foothills; less like an elevator than a moving walkway with a barely perceptible rise. His <i>Fabric 77</i>, his first mix CD since 2011's <i>Conducted</i>, is almost Escherian in the way it folds four-to-the-floor beats into a series of improbable twists and turns that nevertheless seem, somehow, to unroll eternally in a straight line. Are we floating in space, or marching in place? </p>
<p class=""p1"">Like a growing number of DJs who have used their respective Fabric mixes to showcase their own music—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4505-ricardo-villalobos/"">Ricardo Villalobos</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27648-omar-s/"">Omar S</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8811-shackleton"">Shackleton</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31091-guy-gerber/"">Guy Gerber</a>—Dettmann devotes the bulk of his set either to his own productions or tracks he's released to his MDR label. (The majority of the latter he describes as ""unreleased demos""—that is, cuts submitted to the label that he's been playing out for a while now, as long as three years, in the case of Rod's ""RSPCT""—and while they are all slated for eventual release, they make <i>Fabric 77 </i>a goldmine for Dettmann trainspotters curious about the composition of his current club sets.) That 15 out of 19 cuts bear his fingerprints, either as producer or A&amp;R, underscores the extent to which DJing, for Dettmann, is a means to the creation of a kind of totalizing aesthetic; it's DJing as <i>gesamtkunstwerk</i>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">There might be a temptation to describe that aesthetic as ""minimal,"" but it's too roughly textured for that, evoking splintered wood, charcoal lumps, mud puddles in a rutted road. Arte Povera would be a more accurate reference point for both the mix's rough-hewn analog sounds (chalky hi-hats, tarnished oil drums, paper-bag rustle) and its function-first sense of structure, which is only as elaborate as a line of paving stones or a loom for weaving burlap. The artists responsible for the tracks selected for the mix include Terence Fixmer, Answer Code Request, Dario Zenker, Norman Nodge, Joey Anderson, Carl Craig's Paperclip People, and quite a few producers with a fairly low profile so far—FBK, François X, Lockertmatik, Marcelus, Wincent Kunth. I hesitate to go into much detail about individual tracks, however, because music like this resists description, and the very point of the mix is how the component parts function as a composite whole.</p>
<p class=""p1"">There's nothing like immediate gratification to be found in this hardscrabble landscape, but there are plenty of highlights that attest to Dettmann's mastery of detail threaded through its loosely-woven zone-out. Midway through Rod's ""RSPCT"", the beat drops out and leaves only a syncopated foghorn bleat, pealing like Teflon tympani, its dotted eighth-note rhythm briefly offering a countervailing pulse before the downbeat comes stumbling back in. There are the looped chants of Nodge's ""BB 1.0"", which I somehow missed the first dozen times I listened to the mix. In Dettmann's ""Lightworks (Ø [Phase] Remix)"", there's a glassy woodblock (or is that woody glass brick?) pattern so quietly insistent that you begin to wonder if it's been running through the mix from the every beginning, without notice. Then, by the time you finish that thought, it's gone. Between Answer Code Request's ""Transit 0.2"" and Dario Zenker's ""Nearlin"", we're treated to what might be the call and response of two mating woodpeckers, set against a dusky backdrop of swirling dust and seductive gloom.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But even fans of patient, hypnotic, ultra-reduced techno may find <i>Fabric 77</i> too subtle for its own good. Or perhaps it's just too uniform? His 2011 mix for the Music Man label, <i>Conducted</i>, had more readily apparent character, veering from the lush Detroitisms of Reel by Real's ""Sundog"" through the paranoid pinball wizardry of the Analogue Cops' ""Why You Love Me"" and on through the gothed-out clang of Morphosis ""Too Far""; <i>Conducted </i>covered plenty of ground, but here, the cuts are so similar in tone and intensity that one wonders if the mix would sound any different if he re-recorded the set according to an arbitrary reshuffling of the sequence. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Nevertheless, as a journey that's not quite a journey, this can take you far outside yourself. Throughout, Dettmann's use of shape and texture makes me think of little clumps of lichen clinging to darkly lustrous sheets of slate; it's a fitting metaphor for a mix that proceeds like a long hike along a mountain ridge, far above the tree line, watching over a world that peels away below. In a musical landscape littered with drops, there's a relief in four-to-the-floor beats like these never quite seem to touch the ground.</p></div>"|19613.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19613-marcel-dettmann-fabric-77/|7.1|Philip Sherburne

And since their 2005 masterwork <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5773-twin-cinema/""><i>Twin Cinema</i></a>—an album that perfectly balanced their formative power-pop freneticism with loftier, widescreened ambitions—that lever has been gradually sliding down, with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10557-challengers/""><i>Challengers</i></a> from 2007 and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14195-together/""><i>Together</i></a> from 2010 emphasizing more patiently paced set pieces that tiptoed the fine line between gracefully decompressing and killing the buzz altogether. But even if such gambles cost them a few ADD-addled admirers along the way, you get the sense the New Pornographers would soldier on at their own leisurely clip even if no one was listening. Because, for the principals involved, the New Pornographers are less a band than a holiday resort, “a vacation from rock'n'roll music, inside rock'n'roll music,” as resident siren Neko Case <a href=""http://contests.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_02.22.01/music/pornographers.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">once put it</a>. And boy, do they ever need it now.</p>
<p>Since the release of <i>Together</i>, the band’s principal songwriters have experienced the highest of highs and lowest of lows: Dan Bejar produced his most immaculate, universally acclaimed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1068-destroyer/"">Destroyer</a> album to date with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15034-kaputt/""><i>Kaputt</i></a>; conversely, bandleader <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3100-ac-newman/"">A.C. Newman</a> and Case <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18451-neko-case-the-worse-things-get-the-harder-i-fight/"" target=""_blank"">each</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17200-shut-down-the-streets/"" target=""_blank"">released</a> sobering, uncharacteristically introspective solo records written in the aftermath of deaths in their respective families. So if the previous two New Pornographers records sometimes had a procedural air about them (with each vocalist checking in to collect their three-song rations), the vim and vigor of <i>Brill Bruisers</i> forcefully reasserts just how important and therapeutic the enterprise is to all involved. And that album title is brilliantly apropos for both the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brill_Building"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">song-factory connotations</a> and intimations of violence: here, the New Pornographers resemble not so much a supergroup as a gang, wielding hooks like shivs, guitar riffs like machine guns, and synths like laser beams. The opening title track isn’t just a blown-out bubblegum pop song made from a box full of Bazooka Joes—it’s a swarming, instantly thrusting you into a dizzying flurry of “bo-ba-ba-bo” harmonies coming at you from all sides. The steady beat of latter-day New Pornographers may remain, but it’s delivered with the force of a body check.</p>
<p>While greatly indebted to pop movements of the past—from ’60s psychedelia to ’70s glam to ’80s new wave—the New Pornographers have never felt like a purely retro exercise, their best songs too jacked-up and exuberant to lapse into studious classicism. But <i>Brill Bruisers</i> feels like their most contemporary recording to date, and a great deal of credit for that lies with the person who, historically, has been the one least likely to be mentioned in a New Pornographers review— Blaine Thurier—and fellow keyboardist Kathryn Calder. In contrast to <i>Together</i>’s cello-dramatic sound, <i>Brill Bruisers </i>foregrounds their playing, not to opportunistically recast the band as au courant synth-pop, but to restore the forward momentum that was in scarcer supply on recent records, from the starbursts that propel Case’s daydreamy turn on “Champions of Red Wine” to the zippy oscillations that power Bejar’s triumphant “War on the East Coast” to the meaty tones that lend the authoritative march of “Backstairs” (the band’s most imposing rocker to date) a little extra spring in its goosestep.</p>
<p>Thurier and Calder's elevated roles speak to the more integrated teamwork in effect on <i>Brill Bruisers</i>; while tracklists on past records could be easily segregated by singer, there’s a greater degree of vocal trade-offs and harmonic interplay that heightens the communal, celebratory sense of occasion. And with the Fleetwood Mac attack of “Fantasy Fools”, the delirious “Dancehall Domine”, and <i>Tommy</i>-sized closer “You Tell Me Where”, the New Pornographers deliver the sort of pure pop head rush they haven’t unleashed in years. (Bejar is an especially feisty mood, hurtling himself into his trio of heart-racing contributions like a drunk who’s just found out the wedding he’s at has an open bar—all the while, in true contrarian fashion, showing up to the New Pornographers’ most modernist album yet with a batch of songs that require harmonica solos.) As ever, the exact meaning of the songs are evasive, but their ascendant arcs readily cast them as underdog anthems for whatever great challenge you face.</p>
<p>Within such a maximalist context (not to mention a bulky 13-song tracklist), acoustic-tempered, middle-geared songs like ""Marching Orders"" and ""Wide Eyes"" can't help but pale next to the aforementioned showstoppers. But <i>Brill Bruisers</i>' most revelatory, parameter-expanding songs are actually the most stripped-down: Calder’s quick-hit “Another Drug Deal of the Heart” serves the same reprieving function here that Tobin Sprout’s minute-long melodic morsels did on Guided by Voices’ classic mid-’90s records, while Newman’s “Hi-Rise”—boasting a circular harmony assembled from clipped vocal tics—imagines what the posthumous, animatronic line-up of his band will sound like at a 22nd-century intergalactic tiki-bar residency. As legend has it, when recording the New Pornographers’ 2000 debut, <i>Mass Romantic</i>, Newman’s primary instruction to Case was to “sing like a robot”; with the futurist sound of <i>Brill Bruisers</i>, the whole band embraces a more electric version of itself—bulked-up in chrome-plated armor, firing on all cylinders, and ready to steamroll anything in its path.</p></div>"|19722.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19722-the-new-pornographers-brill-bruisers/|7.7|Stuart Berman

The second is that their album, <i>De Oro</i>, is a hybrid of swamp-rock and rap that trades on myths of the southern United States as a sinister place where laws are flexible, morals are optional and pleasure is central. Think <i>Spring Breakers</i>, the Musical—a fever dream you might enjoy being part of, provided someone figures out how to remove your conscience first.</p>
<p>The third thing is almost a foregone conclusion, and best stated as a question: Why? Vernon is a powerful musician who could command his fans to pay attention to any number of interesting projects, and in certain cases, has: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27996-volcano-choir/"">Volcano Choir</a>, the stonery soft-rock pastiche of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28643-gayngs/"">Gayngs</a>, and so on. <i>De Oro</i>, though—a collaboration with Gayngs’ Ryan Olson, Bon Iver drummer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28938-s-carey/"">S. Carey</a>, and the Minneapolis rapper Astronautalis—has the petulant air of music that knows it will be heard based on the people playing it, complete with the attempt to obscure who those people are, but not so well that it can’t be easily figured out. Behold a vaguely condescending backstory casting <i>De Oro</i> as an “after-bar-impromptu-musical-round-up” held “[j]ust outside Flori-bama” between a “red-chested god-bassed Southern rapper in a fancy white suit” and his “flashily-clad cronies.” All we’re missing is someone eating grits in a Cutlass up on blocks.</p>
<p>Of course, the history of pop music is filled with alter egos, stage personas, and people generally pretending to be someone other than who they are. But when you start landing what sound like punch lines about the Golden Corral buffet line, one wonders if you’re wrestling with the realities of someone’s identity or just making fun of it. So feel free to shudder with mild disgust as an Auto-Tuned Vernon bellows, “I am young as fuck, I am young as fuck, I am young as fuuuuuuuuck” or, worse, “God damn, we in the southland now!” because they’re dumb lines no matter who sings them but especially insulting in context, like a pimp-and-ho party held in the yard of a white frathouse. The humor lies entirely in the circular logic that they're jokes to begin with.</p>
<p><i>De Oro</i>’s most interesting moments are its quietest ones. See “Sacred Math”, a nightmarish piece of ambience wherein Astronautalis—or his alter ego Creflo, pick your poison—strings together a series of vignettes about spring break, each one more hollow than the last. “Spring Break ’89/ We were choppin’ crab legs into lines/ The Old Bay did burn and we bled out our eyes but we agree it was a really great time,” he whispers, the last line repeated in some effort to convince himself that it’s true. Here, <i>De Oro</i> really is in step with Harmony Korine—and not the glitz of <i>Spring Breakers</i> but the muted depravity of <i>Gummo</i>, whose scenes of small-town life seemed calibrated to make you feel fascinated and disgusted at the same time.</p>
<p>As the hot licks pile up, I keep thinking of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"">Das Racist</a>, who managed to dismantle clichés about rap by embracing them, or about Vernon and Olson’s own work with Gayngs, which recreated soft-rock with a reverence just skewed enough to open up soft-rock as a concept—its parameters, its rules, what made it tick—without just devolving into cracks about boats and cocaine. Here we have a few well-connected guys hacking around and occasionally playing hickface, occasionally with great empathy but more often just for the fun of it, which is I suppose just another way to say ""America.""  </p></div>"|19718.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19718-jason-feathers-de-oro/|3.5|Mike Powell

There are a few reasons for that: both hail from Ohio, Connections' particular brand of rock'n'roll bears a resemblance to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3353-robert-pollard/"">Robert Pollard</a>'s, and even though they're a fairly new band, they're proving themselves to be similarly prolific. But no prolific band emerges from a vacuum. Connections' Kevin Elliott and Andy Hampel were in <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/1420347-84-Nash"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">84 Nash</a> (and released albums on Pollard's label Rockathon) starting in 1995; that band broke up around 2005, and five years later, the two guys started hanging out again, recording songs together in a Columbus basement.</p>
<p>Their rekindled partnership apparently ignited a particularly fruitful period of songwriting. Along with Elliott's brother Adam (who also drums in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5176-times-new-viking/"">Times New Viking</a>), <span>Dave Capaldi </span>(from <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/1536943-El-Jesus-De-Magico"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">El Jesus de Magico</a>), and Philip Kim, they released two very good albums last year—<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18038-connections-private-airplane/""><i>Private Airplane</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18556-connections-body-language/""><i>Body Language</i></a>—as well as the <a href=""http://connectionsband.bandcamp.com/album/tough-city-ep"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Tough City</i></a> EP. Now, there's <i>Into Sixes</i>, their latest record which was recorded (and pressed) at <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/9067-musicol/"">Columbus' legendary Musicol Recording Studio</a>. The challenge for this one, then, is to at least maintain the same consistency they brought for their first two albums while hopefully churning out at least one song as satisfying and immediate as, say, <a href=""http://connectionsband.bandcamp.com/track/mall-lights"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Mall Lights""</a>.</p>
<p>And there's at least one such highlight: ""Beat the Sky"", a power pop gem that ebbs and flows for maximum impact. There are direct, fuzzy power chords, which occasionally pull back and give way to a beautiful, elegant central melody. As a whole, the album doesn't sound expensive or lush, but <i>Into Sixes</i> is thoughtfully produced regardless, and the no-frills recording quality brings forward whichever instrument is doing the most exciting work in a given moment. Solos frequently swoop in and breathe new life into a song just as it nears over-repetition. </p>
<p>Most of <i>Into Sixes</i>' biggest successes are its most powerful moments—it's tough to beat the beefed up Twilley/Seymour/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1385-the-exploding-hearts/"">Exploding Hearts</a>-style churn of ""Cruise Control""—but Connections also excel at slowing things down. Teardrop-ballad ""Home by the Sea"" starts out slow and mournful before bolstering the sound and introducing some optimism, singing ""It'll be OK"" while ushering in another well-placed guitar solo in the process. It's hard to imagine a better ending to this record, too, than the upbeat, jangling acoustic closer ""Awesome Beach"", with bittersweet sentiments that are executed beautifully: ""I can't hold you/ My arms are on fire.""</p>
<p>There's plenty on <i>Into Sixes </i>to suggest that Connections are one of the best new power-pop bands going, but the band occasionally falters, too. ""Minister of Ah Ah Ah""'s structure feels rote and unvarying, with not much to break up the handclaps and blurted vowel sounds. The band's slower moments risk losing momentum, too: the start of ""Extremely Boss"" is a bit clunky, but they thankfully pivot away into a direction that possesses more energy and drive. In that way, Connections are a resilient band, one with a seemingly effortless knack for writing and arranging a dozen great songs every few months. They aren't show-offs, but they do what they do expertly.</p></div>"|19691.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19691-connections-into-sixes/|6.8|Evan Minsker

It seemingly depicts Ganglion Reef itself—an imaginary island that the members of Wand might just frequent from time to time, perhaps transported there by the same psychotropic substances that fuel their music. Travel, after all, is what <i>Ganglion Reef</i> is all about: the passageways between one place or state of mind to another. Accordingly, it <i>moves</i>.</p>
<p>Frontman Cory Thomas Hanson is a mover himself. In addition to playing (usually fleetingly) with a wide array of fellow L.A. garage-rockers over the past few years, from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/15881-together-pangea-snakedog/"">together PANGEA</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/16921-meatbodies-wahoo/"">Meatbodies</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29837-mikal-cronin/"">Mikal Cronin</a>, the singer/guitarist/keyboardist helms the electronic pop project <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1h-laSj0vQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WHITE</a>. Hanson just can’t sit still, and accordingly what makes <i>Ganglion Reef </i>so euphorically hypnotic is the way it translates his itinerant, hyperkinetic tendencies into song. “Clearer” stomps and throbs through a barrage of zap-gun bursts and bongo-punctuated, acid-flashback breakdowns; beneath it all, riffs the size of thunderbolts hurl the song through wormhole after wormhole. Hanson’s breathy, elfin voice glides overheard, but it’s only half as ethereal as his steam-calliope synths and creamy smears of distortion.</p>
<p>The albums most fantastic voyage is “Fire on the Mountain (I-II-III)”, an epic that manages to condense itself into a relatively compact five minutes. Unpacking it is effortless, but not without effect; Hanson’s high, glassy coo is light years away from Lee Landey’s infernally heavy bassline, and the gulf between them is a vacuum that yanks at sanity. The airlock is completely breached by the time the track hits its second movement, a spasm of Paleolithic proto-metal that wrestles with Hanson’s progressive-folk sprawl. It’s way too much to fit coherently into a single song, but coherence isn’t the endpoint. When an aural lightshow of intertwined synths and guitar solos lifts and soars like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4475-the-verve/"">the Verve</a> with a sci-fi fetish, it feels like infinity has cracked open.</p>
<p>Hanson’s fantasy bent is even more pronounced on “Strange Inertia (Ctrl Alt Death)”, a shakily scrawled love letter to other dimensions that expends every Crayola in the box, and “Flying Golem”, a surrealist lullaby that resembles ""Adventure Time"" fanfic set to singsong psychedelia. Fantasy gaming is referenced more explicitly on “Generator Larping”—but instead of coming across as a live-action role-playing session of <i>World of Warcraft</i>, it spends six minutes daydreaming <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/546-the-beatles/"">the Beatles</a>’ “Tomorrow Never Knows” as rendered in a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3024-neu/"">Neu!</a>-like cascade of sine waves and pulses. There’s a faint krautrock undertow to <i>Ganglion Reef</i>, but it’s motorik for a sandy beach instead of the Autobahn.<b> </b></p>
<p>Plenty of new psych-rock albums are content to fill the signifier checklist and then just sit there, but <i>Ganglion Reef</i> is as much a vehicle as a destination—and rather than wallowing in inner space, it’s a gateway to other worlds, not so much an escape as an intrepid exploration. It’s fun, sure, but it’s also thrillingly restless, at times almost desperate. “Run for your life,” Hanson chants on “Broken Candle”, an organ-toggled, kaleidoscopically melodic dreamscape that could be an evolutionary offshoot of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4746-the-zombies/"">the Zombies</a>’ “Brief Candles”. It sounds like winsome nonsense, but it’s telling. Prowling and propulsive, Wand are musical sharks; if they stop swimming, they’ll die. No wonder <i>Ganglion Reef</i> is the liquid, liminal domain they made for themselves to dwell in.</p></div>"|19650.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19650-wand-ganglion-reef/|7.4|Jason Heller

After signing with <a href=""http://www.profoundlorerecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Profound Lore</a> on the strength of a demo, their debut album is a tour de force, and the quartet have made it clear that they're exactly the sort of band that deserves a leg up out of obscurity. The album eases in with a chiming, distorted, medieval-sounding intro before diving straight into the fracas; the songs are structured in unexpected, interesting ways, and as wimpy as the ""atmospheric"" or ""progressive black metal"" tags can be, Alraune give them some much-needed bite. This is raw, cathartic black metal devoid of pretension or compassion, but it does allow itself a few liberties in its pursuit of the greater evil.</p>
<p>Drummer Tyler Coburn (also of Yautja and Gnarwal) plays a crucial role in the band, and he's one of the most present metal drummers out there right now. Every kick, every fill, every perfectly calibrated beat sends tremors through the songs, muscling in on the guitars’ traditional supremacy with a dazzling display of talent and ingenuity. As much as Alraune worships black metal’s purest forms, Tyler’s jazz-influenced drum style adds a skittering, unpredictable quality to the recording that renders it experimental by default. It livens up the otherwise colorless interludes in the deceptively languid “Simulcra”, slashes through corpsepainted melodies with technicolor streaks on the title track, and easily keeps pace with the ferocious guitar work on album highlight “Kissed By The Red”.</p>
<p>“The Process of Self-Immolation” is the most straightforward track on the album, with its driving tempo, unhinged howls, and icy Second Wave tremolo that bleeds into crystalline melodic leads. The inhuman level of control Coburn holds over the rhythm section cows J. Weilburg's tectonic bass into a supporting role without smothering its propulsive hum, and gives the guitar free rein to buck and howl without impunity. The album's other crown jewel, ""Exordium"", is positively explosive, as Z. Allen and J. House pound out the chords in a dual frenzy, twisting and tearing through one another's work while preserving a wild kind of cohesion. Stern, clenched-teeth threefold vocalizations complete the sonic tableau, issuing forth from the corroded throats of Allen, Weilburg, and House to wax hoarse and commanding in equal measure.</p>
<p>The album only sports five tracks and could've stood to include at least one more song, if only because five just isn't enough. But <i>The Process of Self-Immolation</i> is a thoroughly impressive debut, one that successfully bridges the gap between the black metal of old and its newer incarnations without sacrificing any of the darkness or the strangeness that makes the genre so great. Alraune has hit upon something special here, and deserves your undivided attention. </p></div>"|19591.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19591-alraune-the-process-of-self-immolation/|7.5|Kim Kelly

The Swedish duo of Joakim Benon and Elin Kastlander were viewed as anonymous at first, but like many bands who enter the world that way, they now say that lurking in the shadows was simply a byproduct of releasing their music quickly, before they had a plan in place. However, even as we got to know them a little, and put faces to the sounds on record and on stages, they still seem unknowable: As Kastlander quotes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"">Drake</a> on their third record, <i>V</i>, it's their world, and they'll get high and/or die if they want to—and we're still stuck watching from outside no matter how cozy it sounds.</p>
<p>But <i>V</i> does mark a shift for the duo. With this record, they've started capitalizing their name, and it's a formality that hints at the collection's bigger, fuller production and ambitions. They don't exactly sound like they're ready to fill stadiums, but they definitely got out of bed and recorded this in a proper studio. That said, even with the string swells, guitar solos, and bolder singing, the dozy sentiments are the same.</p>
<p>It's easy to be briefly taken aback by the ominous instrumental opener, which sounds like a <i>Cremaster</i> soundtrack outtake, before a snippet of folkier sounds blend in toward the end. These are quickly cut, new-classical-style, by chimes and castanets before the strings and pulses of the rather grandiose first proper song, ""Dynasti"", which features strings, smeary vocals, and the expressed sentiment ""I want to be with you when we lose control."" As in the past, this is a couple's album, where that couple is the entire universe.</p>
<p>It's followed by the single ""Dean &amp; Me,"" which opens with this image: ""I know I'm drunk/ I know it's late/ But I will call you anyway."" The title and us-against-the-world vibe is reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"">M83</a>'s ""Kim &amp; Jessie"", as the slightly drunk protagonist goes on, ""Something inside me tells me we should be together...I'm dancing with stars and they dancing with me."" The entirety of <i>V</i> carries a similar John Hughes-by way of-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11406-saturdaysyouth/""><i>Saturdays=Youth</i></a> vibe, albeit one viewed thru the lens of <i>The Breakfast Club</i>'s ""weirdo"" Ally Sheedy character rather than Molly Ringwald.</p>
<p>Such a worldview is typical for JJ, as is the tendency to be self-referential; the title of ""Dean &amp; Me"" is a reflection of ""Me &amp; Dean"", the acoustic ballad that closed out the group's 2009 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13326-jj-n-2/""><i><span id=""docs-internal-guid-ce9c9ffa-d532-0b89-0ce1-4df90a9df0e3"">jj n° 2</span></i></a>. Benon and Kastlander are drawn to echoes and self-references, elements that are part of many relationships. It's since been revealed that <i>jj n° 2</i> and the 2010 follow-up <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14045-jj-n-3/""><i>jj n° 3</i></a> were originally supposed to be released as a double album; instead, they were released separately and followed by various EPs and even shorter releases, and accordingly it's easy to see their catalog as sketches for the ideas presented on <i>V</i>.</p>
<p>The album's first six songs are among the best JJ have ever recorded. There's the wintry ""All White Everything"", and the focus on elements of ""white"", especially snow, present JJ as a bright, morning-sunrise version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5657-crystal-castles/"">Crystal Castles</a>, the rainbows reflected in a pristine snowfort with no footsteps around it. This is especially apparent on ""When I Need You"", a more stripped-down song that, despite the strings and electronic gurgles, is a showcase of Kastlander's stronger, windswept, soaring vocals. (Like much of <i>V</i>, the lyrics possess strong imagery: ""I don't know how these drinks keep coming by/ Oh no, boy, they make me see you so bright just like tonight."") The bubbling ""Fågelsången"" folds into a tropical vibe complete with bird sounds, reminiscent of <i>jj n° 2</i>'s ""From Africa to Málaga"".</p>
<p>But as pretty as <i>V</i> can be, it flatlines. If JJ had released the first handful of songs as an EP, it might have resulted in a minor masterpiece, but things get repetitive towards the album's second half. Part of JJ's past charm has been their tendency to unexpectedly place <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"">Lil Wayne</a> samples, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4400-ti/"">T.I.</a> lyrics, or references to getting high in a song about feeling low. That continues on <i>V</i>, but too much of it sounds like what we've already heard. Elsewhere, there are forgettable retreads, moments that are pretty but not much else. ""Full"" is paint-by-numbers JJ, while ""Hold Me"" feels like a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27383-salem"">Salem</a> outtake that would've been better off staying lost. JJ do occasionally shake off the doldrums, though, when guitars enter the fray. There's acoustic strumming and enjoyably sloppy soloing on the otherwise so-so ""Innerlight"", and the closer, ""All Ways, Always"", is lead by a riff ripped from the Steve Miller Band's playbook, ending up as JJ's first real psychedelic burner.</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, unfair to expect much more from JJ than what they've already given their listeners, and anyway, even during <i>V</i>'s less compelling moments, getting lost in the sumptuous production and lyrical moments (""I believe in tears"") has its charms. The problem is that, as time goes on, you realize that's all JJ are willing to offer—charms, yes, but bereft of fuller statements. So though it does often feel like JJ have hit a wall on <i>V</i>, when they're able to scale that wall and dance with the stars, the album's a treat.</p></div>"|19602.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19602-jj-v/|6.7|Brandon Stosuy

Yes, they are both female Norwegian singers—strong leaders and writers with consistently compelling visions for the music they make, too—but that’s where the similarities seemingly cease. Hval is the tempestuous imp to Wallumrød’s version of graceful austerity. Wallumrød has reworked the songs of Henry Purcell <a href=""http://player.ecmrecords.com/pessi-wallumrod"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">with a classical harpist</a> and offered her perfect, patient coo to sublime <a href=""http://www.susannamagical.com/index.php?view=releases&amp;album=5&amp;category=susannas+catalog&amp;c=3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covers</a> of <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2009/nov/28/susanna-wallumroed"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thin Lizzy</a> and Black Sabbath, Tom Petty and Will Oldham; last year, she issued a beautiful song cycle with <a href=""http://ensembleneon.no"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the chamber group Ensemble neoN</a>. Hval, meanwhile, began 2013’s <i>Innocence is Kinky</i> by whispering, “At night/ I watch people fucking on my computer” over a slyly lurid beat. She embraces sonic bedlam and mischief, funneling both into songs with deeply psychological underpinnings. The pairing feels tantamount to asking <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"">Chan Marshall</a> link up with with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5367-st-vincent/"">Annie Clark</a> because they’re both critically appreciated American female singers.   </p>
<p>But that stylistic frisson and the shared willingness of Hval and Wallumrød to explore such tension is one of the greatest strengths of <i>Meshes of Voice</i>, the transfixing result of a 2009 live collaboration and one of the best records of either’s career. These 15 interconnected pieces unfold a surrealistic saga where the narrator wakes to find “I have lost my soul”—at the bottom of a black lake, no less. The tale twists through dream states, mythological allusions and impressionistic analogies, which the sounds match through a web of halcyon ballads, harsh-noise expositions and fragmented art-rock. <i>Meshes of Voice</i> mirrors the multimedia ambition of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5366-laurie-anderson/"">Laurie Anderson</a> and aligns itself with the self-referential complexity of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3096-joanna-newsom/"">Joanna Newsom</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1068-destroyer/"">Dan Bejar</a>. It's a singular world built of two very individual talents, each gifted with the plasticity to turn a mere live collaboration into a true relationship.   </p>
<p>As the title implies, the dual stars are the singers’ voices themselves. Wallumrød has the sort of stainless tone that could lead soft jazz outfits toward the tops of adult-contemporary charts. That ease is epitomized by “A Sudden Swing”, where she rises and falls alongside the curves of a piano’s path with classical beauty. Hval is more of a chameleon and jester, though, her voice able to shift from spoken-word scorn to singsong lilt without notice; her imagination and versatility suggest a thornier <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/363-bjork/"">Björk</a>. During “Running Down”, she funnels the phrase “milk pleasures” through software that makes her sound like a broken automated teller, repeating a meaningless robotic mantra. But by song’s end, she’s purring a blanket-soft lullaby against the horizon.</p>
<p>The voices are only the fixtures, however, the reference points for a trip that races headlong into altogether unexpected territory. There seem to be few risks that either partner is unwilling to take, no set of shocks for which their style is too precious. Hval has tinkered with noise before and even said she likes to write songs over beds of it, but “I Have Walked This Body” is a commitment to cacophony—and a total triumph with it. They sculpt static and feedback with the skill and finesse of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7929-aaron-dilloway/"">Aaron Dilloway</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5284-john-wiese/"">John Wiese</a>. Wallumrød submits to it, her manipulated air slipping inside the mess as if that’s where it has always belonged; elsewhere, Hval adds gorgeous harmonies to “O Sun O Medusa,” her refracted notes trailing Wallumrød like a comet’s tail.</p>
<p>While there are some mostly pretty songs and completely chaotic numbers, <i>Meshes of Voice </i>compels by ignoring such binaries. The soft beauty “A Sudden Swing” ends under sinister threat, droning strings and circling percussion bubbling from beneath the pristine piano like a toxic leak. Hval delivers a childlike chant during “Milk Pleasures,” her voice suggesting a pixie. But she sings of mongrel body parts and milk running down pale legs, as Wallumrød answers with distant, ghastly echoes. <i>Meshes of Voice</i> depends on the reputations of its makers, but it delights most when they let those legacies fall away or, at the very least, bend in new ways.</p>
<p><i>Meshes of Voice</i> is very much a unified program of music, where songs drift into one another and vestiges and premonitions blur what might otherwise be absolute boundaries. The long industrial exhalation at the end of “I Have Walked This Body”, for instance, creeps beneath the resplendent piano of “O Sun O Medusa”, where it’s picked up and suddenly romanticized by a bowed double bass. Those are mechanical links, though, as the more important bonds are the repeating musical and lyrical motifs and the way that the four-piece ensemble shifts them every time they arrive. “I Have a Darkness” is a glowering monster, with a din of static and stunted signals spilling from disembodied vocals. Toward the end, though, a distant seraphim choir sings the words “honey dew” on repeat—not beating back the noise, but certainly pushing against its shadows. Several minutes later, Wallumrød sings, “Dawn came quiet/dawn came cool/The inside of my eyelid is glazed with honeydew.” The source of that earlier sound is finally revealed; her voice is low and powerful with defiant confidence, overrunning a harmonium drone that crackles beneath her.</p>
<p>Just before album’s end, Wallumrød begins another song with the same stanza and the same strength, Hval’s robotic voice circling behind her in an instant of sudden unity. These moments offer arrows toward a resolution, to the moment in the finale where Hval “pulled out my heart from the seaweed.” The narrative here often feels slippery and unattainable, <a href=""http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173247"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">like a “Kubla Khan” dream</a> that’s been recorded in front of a live audience. But the repetition supplies the signposts, assurances that you too can outlast this nightmare of mirrors and confusion.  </p>
<p>That adventurous perseverance has a lot to do with why <i>Meshes of Voice</i> is so successful. Hval and Wallumrød, refined and distinct stylists, committed more to the value of this concept than of their own reputations. They seemed to bristle less at the the idea of being typecast as a popular female Norwegian singer than not being able to turn that expectation into something more than pretty covers of popular songs or abrasive explorations of the psyche. As immersive and deep as the lake around which it revolves, <i>Meshes of Voice</i> adds a new dimension to the output of both its makers.</p></div>"|19674.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19674-susanna-jenny-hval-meshes-of-voice/|8.2|Grayson Haver Currin

It’s perfectly fine for your friend to just rattle off whatever they’re listening to of late and, hell, it can be enjoyable when musicians acknowledge their influences and figuratively do the same—provided they’re able to express not just <i>what </i>they’re inspired by, but also <i>why.</i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30243-the-young/"">The Young</a> don’t do anything of the sort on <i>Chrome Cactus; </i>even worse, they're ""record collector rock"" that doesn’t even have an interesting record collection.</div>
<p>This is not to say the Young lack good taste—they just have nearly the same exact taste as nearly every other upstart guitar band that wants a minute of your time. At the very least, they put on for their city of Austin, adhering to the presumable spirit of SXSW; which is, to veer off in a multitude of directions while still using both parts of “indie rock” to determine their true north. Are they into psych-rock? Oh, definitely. Kraut-rock? Of course, that’s the good shit, man. ZZ Top and Tom Petty?  Hell, big part of their upbringing. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain"">The Jesus and Mary Chain</a>?  I mean, who <i>doesn’t</i> like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11882-psychocandy-darklands-automatic-honeys-dead-stoned-dethroned/""><i>Psychocandy</i></a>? The syllabus of <i>Chrome Cactus</i> reads like the most basic indie rock bio-as-OKCupid profile: it’s not intriguing in the slightest, but it hits all the right SEO points. </p>
<p>And like most astute but unambitious crate diggers, you get the sense that the Young rep JAMC because it allows them to hide behind distortion, psych, and Kraut—because when it comes to writing hooks, those formats sorta let you off the hook. Hans Zimmerman’s voice isn’t tuneless, it just has the range of a touchtone phone. He wields <i>Chrome Cactus'</i> inert melodies like blunt objects, nudging at the rhythm section’s endless boogie only in the slightest. The Young don’t even really play motorik-style rhythms, as just about everything here ends in the same place it started, at the same volume. Add in Zimmerman’s nasal wheeze, and the dominant sound of <i>Chrome Cactus</i> is ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4929-silversun-pickups"">Silversun Pickups</a> without the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMDt3pgjJSA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">'Guitar Hero' riffs</a>"", which means the Young does a better job of making you reconsider Silversun Pickups than that band’s own <a href=""http://silversunpickups.com/2014/01/the-singles-collection-new-song/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">singles collection</a>.</p>
<p>That said, it’s only offensive if you’re insulted by killing time; <i>Chrome Cactus</i> is actually a useful calling card for a band that could open for 95% of all major-indie guitar acts and be pleasantly ambient in a live setting, with nothing in their catalog that would disturb a conversation. But as <i>Chrome Cactus</i>’ captive listening audience, the closest you get to genuine pleasure is a perverse relief over the most mundane things allowing you to differentiate one track from the next.—we're talking about details as insignificant as an acoustic guitar (“Apaches Throat”), a Beavis-esque vocal melody (“Moondog First Quarter”), and a riff that kinda-sorta sounds like Stone Temple Pilots’ “Meat Plow” (“Mercy”).</p>
<p>Even when record collectors use the term “record collector rock,” they likely respect the fact that making <i>any</i> kind of record is hard work. The process of summoning inspiration, writing songs, fine-tuning them in a live setting and laying them to tape<span>—</span>this takes so much self-belief, so much sacrifice, so much effort. How can you not bleed, sweat or cry on the track even the tiniest bit?  By most metrics, <i>Chrome Cactus</i> is one of the least interesting albums of the year; focus solely on how a presumable rock record managed to be so nondescript, and it’s one of the most interesting.</p></div>"|19512.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19512-the-young-chrome-cactus/|3.5|Ian Cohen

The connotations are mostly stuffy, but it’s also a wink at the band’s relationship with the indie-pop canon they figure into. Their new album, <i>Chorus,</i> sounds like an English band emulating an American band around 1984; as it happens, Literature are actually four men from Philadelphia (including former Pitchfork contributor Kevin Attics). Their sound sums up so much history: the antsy enthusiasm of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5948-the-feelies/"">the Feelies</a>, the twinkling tone of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2684-johnny-marr/"">Johnny Marr</a>’s guitar, the “Go on, then” romanticism of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/522-buzzcocks"">Buzzcocks</a>. But instead of coming off as a retread of bands dead and gone, it charms with humor and heart—a record with feeling, even if it feels like something you already know.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><i>Chorus </i>is Literature's first LP recorded for indie powerhouse Slumberland, and accordingly they've cleaned up their act compared to their earlier recordings. The first iteration of their indisputably English-sounding “Tie Dye (Your Life)”, which was originally released as a 7” in 2013, sounded like it was ripped from a hand-me-down cassette; the re-recorded version that appears here is smoother without losing any energy and the instrumentation packs a proper wallop. The difference in fidelity is akin to hearing a song coming out of someone else’s car versus hearing it from your own stereo.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">The uptick in sound quality is a lovely makeover, and accordingly <i>Chorus</i> is a lovely record. Listen to the way singer Nathan Cardaci’s voice stretches to cover the soaring melody on “The Girl, The Gold Watch, and Everything”, later switching between sigh and croon within the sentimental bloom of “Court/Date”. It’s as quick and sweet as a stolen kiss—just three songs pass the three-minute mark, and only one slows the pace from “nervous” to a swaying but still fairly lively “drunk”. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate"">Real Estate</a>, their songs work with such a select number of jingly-jangly sounds that they risk approaching mere repetition, but Literature's approach comes across as a pointed tonal consistency. It’s not laziness that pushes them to look backwards, and so a lyric from “The English Soft Hearts” sums up Literature’s mantra: “Time I’ve got is fading faster/ Take me back I’ll hunt and gather”.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In some regards, it’s a little out-of-date to be a guitar band, but there are rewards to be found by mining the past. In seeking their answers from the indie rock firmament, Literature have found something freeing, as </span><i>Chorus</i><span> sounds surprisingly fresh. More importantly, it sounds like the record their previous recordings hinted that they wanted to make—a task that isn’t always easy when history's nipping at your heels.</span></p></div>"|19695.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19695-literature-chorus/|7.1|Jeremy Gordon

From 2004 until 2009, Raposa seemed to be one of that loose scene’s most avid explorers. He worked through busted-up cowboy songs and <i>musique concrète</i> hums to create a patchwork empire from blues, folk and country, sewn together with thread drawn of gentle psychedelia.</p>
<p>He kept busy, too, amassing a wide network of collaborators (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"">Sufjan Stevens</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/289-jana-hunter/"">Jana Hunter</a> among them) and averaging an album and a split or single a year. While several of his peers, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6466-james-jackson-toth/"">James Jackson Toth</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3475-phosphorescent/"">Phosphorescent</a>’s Matthew Houck, have remained prolific and even reached unforeseen levels of popularity, Raposa all but disappeared after 2009’s middling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13474-texas-rose-the-thaw-and-the-beasts/""><i>Texas Rose, the Thaw and The Beasts</i></a>. After a string of rather monastic solo offerings, he changed his name to <a href=""http://asthmatickitty.com/artists/raymond-byron-and-the-white-freighter/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Raymond Byron and the White Freighter</a> and recruited a proper rock band to record 2012’s <i>Little Death Shaker</i>. But the new project’s roadhouse grit was mostly a half-measure; Raposa spent a large portion of the record wading through the same sad-bastard penury as Castanets. He’d aimed to turn left and, instead, ambled into little more than a circle around himself.</p>
<p>A decade after the first Castanets LP, Raposa has reprised the name for <i>Decimation Blues</i>, a fragmented 12-song album that trends toward the same path that he already spent five albums exploring. Raposa creeps through “Cub”, his voice careful and a touch tragic when suspended over a slow, halting mix of banjo and piano. “Pour it Tall and Pour it True” is a countrypolitan waltz about anxiety and alcohol, grace by gentle saxophone and whammy-bar guitar. It sparkles beneath its tarnish. There’s a hopeful honky-tonk jangle, and at least one number where Raposa plays the part of a beady-eyed bandit, living life at the lip of violence. A series of geographical and temporal postcards, <i>Decimation Blues</i> is, at times, as beautiful and broken as the best of the Castanets’ catalogue, with songs that shape the confessions of a perennial lamenter into hymns for the mutually benighted. <i></i></p>
<p>After a decade with and a departure from Castanets, Raposa still seems to be hamstrung by his own indecision with the project. Castanets always embraced uncertainty by reaching out in the dark for the best new ways to render his old worries. <i>Decimation Blues</i> does that while playing catch-up for the years Castanets missed. Half of the tracks here are inchoate and sometimes embarrassing experiments with beat machines and colorful keyboards; they’re so rudimentary that they lampoon the gravity of Raposa’s words. “Be My Eyes” puts a stuttering techno throb and manic drum fills behind a plea so somber it feels at times like spoken-word deposition. Taking either element seriously, let alone the surf-guitar solo or the indulgent vocals effects, is its own fresh challenge. “My Girl Comes to the City” couples a swaggering beat and a distorted bassline, both of which seem <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktvTqknDobU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cribbed from Imagine Dragons</a>, with copious vibraslap. Raposa plays the part of the weird, itinerant, musical uncle trying to prove to his niece that he can write a hit song. Maybe this one should have stayed a family secret.</p>
<p>The nebulous moments aren’t without their rewards. Raposa sings above looping, loping saxophone and a barely strummed acoustic guitar during the sublime “Tell Them Memphis,” routing his frail falsetto through something like a vocoder. Sure, it makes him sound a bit like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"">Bon Iver</a>, but more important, it gives this bittersweet farewell to friends a trickle of implied tears, and the effect is transfixing. The shuffling “Out for the West” skips into a jubilant Casio solo at its midpoint, an unlikely shift for an elliptical glimpse at the popular ephemera—<i>Vanity Fair</i> magazine covers and Sean Penn movie roles, Portland Trailblazers overtime victories and old Nike basketball sneakers—that ground our pedestrian narratives. But the move strangely fits the song’s discursive theme, like an allusion to a radio hit Raposa might have heard while buying his kicks at the Value Village in 1994.</p>
<p>Many of Raposa’s fellow freak-folk survivors have found compelling ways to sort through or slough off some of the influences that once made their music so unruly. With Wooden Wand, for instance, Toth has developed multiple backing bands and guises that, last year, helped him move between albums of <a href=""http://threelobed.bandcamp.com/album/wooden-wand-the-world-war-iv"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">craggy Crazy Horse jams</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17489-blood-oaths-of-the-new-blues/"" target=""_blank"">inward, abstract folk-rock</a>. Houck has pushed more toward cosmic country and left the shambles of his salad days behind. Hunter has a rock band now, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/911-cocorosie/"">CocoRosie</a>'s doing something like disco. But Raposa remains the wanderer and the tinkerer, with his flirtations webbed only by unease, the battle against it, and his marvelous burl of a voice. <i>Decimation Blues</i> marks the start of Raposa’s second decade in the same wilderness as Castanets, even if he’s now got some new toys for navigation. </p></div>"|19556.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19556-castanets-decimation-blues/|5.9|Grayson Haver Currin

It opens with a heady rush of words, half-rapped and half-sung, that race into the triumphal chorus. The song has no time for the niceties of verses or bridges as O’Connor elaborates on the idea of church: “Take me to church but not the ones that hurt/ ‘Cause that ain’t the truth.” On paper, such repetition might seem lazy or at least unimaginative, but there’s power in the device. O’Connor sounds increasingly defiant and demanding as the song progresses, injecting the song with a hearty dose of ambiguity. “Church” could be any church or, if capped, the Catholic Church, with which she has had a strained relationship for most of her life. More generally, it could be some refuge or safe haven; the bedroom or, more specifically, a mind-obliterating orgasm. It could be a musical groove, a moment of in-the-pocket synchronicity that sounds spiritual. By emptying the song of specifics, O’Connor manages to make it all the more meaningful.</p>
<p>“Take Me to Church” is also a song about new beginnings. The sense of disconnecting oneself from the past puts <i>I’m Not Bossy</i> on par with its predecessor, 2012’s <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16339-how-about-i-be-me-and-you-be-you/"">How About I Be Me (And You Be You)?</a></i>, on which she testified to the ignominy of romance with gravity, dignity, and what sounded like a new and sharper sense of self-possession. On the other hand, it also sounded musically regressive, setting her vocals against fairly innocuous guitar strums and drum loops<i>. I’m Not Bossy, I’m the Boss</i>, is much more musically adventurous, not to mention more lyrically ambitious; it’s also a bit more self-conscious, which means it never packs the same punch as its predecessor.</p>
<p>There has always been a knee-jerk assumption (even by this reviewer) that the “I” in O’Connor’s songs is O’Connor herself—that her one lyrical mode is bluntly confessional. <i>Bossy</i>, however, sounds like an extended attempt to get outside herself and tell someone else’s story. The album cover signals as much: this is O’Connor playing dress-up, shedding her own skin and slipping inside someone else’s, and the album plays like a coming-of-age story told from the perspective of a young woman just realizing her own sexual desires. On “Dense Water Deeper Down”, she’s justifying her attraction to the kind of men her mother warned her about. “Your Green Jacket” and “The Vishnu Room” (the latter being the album's original title, before it was swapped with the <a href=""http://banbossy.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ban Bossy</a>-referencing title it has now) negotiate the terms of commitment and desire, but “The Voice of My Doctor” violently shatters her illusions and introduces harsh consequences to loving so intently. As the album progresses, the woman develops a stronger sense of her own identity and self-worth.</p>
<p>At times, this overarching concept taxes O’Connor’s songwriting abilities. She has a plainspoken, conversational style that tends toward artlessness: “I love you more than I ever loved a man, and I’m shy,” she sings on “The Vishnu Room”. “I want to make love with you more than I ever wanted to.” On the other hand, as a singer she inhabits the character unreservedly, letting those blunt phrases convey the excitement and naïve intensity of new desires. Her technique of layering her voice into a small choir of Sinéads occasionally takes the urgency and edge out of her voice, but during the second half of <i>Bossy</i>, where those emotions grow suddenly more complex, she shows the full expressive range of her voice and sounds more commanding than she has in years. She spits venom on “The Voice of My Doctor”, conveys shaky determination on “8 Good Reasons”, then bends her notes bitterly on “Harbour”, ratcheting up the angst until the song explodes into a loud, caustic outro that recalls the thunder of her 1987 debut, <i>The Lion and the Cobra</i>.</p>
<p>Musically, O’Connor paints with a much broader palette than she did on <i>How About I Be Me</i>. The acoustic guitars and drum loops are still there, but on “Kisses Like Mine” a full backing band bolsters her sexual bravado with snaky <i>Nuggets</i> rock. “The Voice of My Doctor” is even heavier—a sludgy number whose barbed guitar licks echo the narrator’s fierce outrage. That narrative range of sound makes the prayer-like hush of closer “Streetcars”, with its reverbed keyboard and whispered vocals, sound all the more poignant. O’Connor is pushing herself on every song here—maybe not always in the right or most obvious or safest directions, but always with some purpose. A quarter-century into a career that has swung unpredictably from acoustic dissent to big-band jazz to reggae and dub experimentation, she continues to lay claim to every musical possibility and refuses to define herself with only one particular style.</p></div>"|19712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19712-sinead-oconnor-im-not-bossy-im-the-boss/|7.3|Stephen M.

But his is also a cautionary tale of the dissonance that can result when an idiosyncratic artist used to working on their own terms must conform to the promotional demands of the traditional music industry. After 2012’s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16454-acousmatic-sorcery/""><i>Acousmatic Sorcery</i></a> first brought his cassette-crafted ingenuity overground, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18460-willis-earl-beal-nobody-knows/""><i>Nobody knows</i>.</a> did everything it was supposed to: that is, afford Beal the resources (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/702-cat-power/"">Cat Power</a> cameos and all) to scrub up his soot-covered soul and make a play for the indie A-list. And yet, it only took months <a href=""http://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/willis_earl_beal_on_why_hes_leaving_his_label_and_self-releasing_his_new_al"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">for the arrangement to come completely unraveled</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s easy to romanticize obscurity when the artist in question has yet to catch their big break; it’s much less so after they’ve seemingly squandered it. But Beal’s return to the self-release grind feels like a deliberate retreat—not just from the ascendant career path Hot Charity were plotting out for him, but from the theatrical, chameleonic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4544-tom-waits/"">Tom Waits</a>-like guise upon which he first made his name. <i>Experiments in Time</i> is an album released at a career crossroads that’s very much about being at a crossroads—professional, romantic, or otherwise. “What do you want?/ What do you need?/ You’ve gotta make a decision/ How to proceed,” Beal offers by way introduction on the opening, open-ended “Questions”, and there are countless other self-reflexive ruminations just like that here, each wrapped in a hauntingly minimalist ambience that sounds like what staring at a blank canvas feels like. </p>
<p>For Beal, the titular experiment in time involves seeing just how much he can slow it down while maintaining the slightest semblance of a song. Trading in the visceral for the ethereal, he couches his anxieties and dark-night-of-the-soul introspection inside weightless, formless hymns that threaten to vaporize before your ears. This is the blues rendered in whites and greys—an expression of pain and catharsis that’s ultimately anesthetized by the smooth, omnipresent, foghorn-like synth hum that permeates these songs (and whose fade-ins/outs often provide the only delineation between where one track ends and another begins). The one cogent link to Beal’s past work is a new version of the <i>Acousmatic Sorcery</i> track “Monotony”—once a poignant, off-the-cuff lo-fi lullaby about the doldrums of boredom, it reappears here as an oppressively sullen, blank-stare recitation that all too easily lives up to its title, and serves as an unintentional mission statement for this intensely monochromatic album.</p>
<p><i>Experiments in Time</i>’s spare presentation inevitably puts all the emphasis on Beal’s voice, which has shed the carny-barker growl of old and mellowed into a silken croon. It’s a wonderful instrument to behold when Beal has a fully sculpted song to work with: the soft, cymbal-tapped “Slow Bus” (one of just two songs here to deploy any kind of rhythm track) is a hot-summer-night R&amp;B reverie summoning the quietest of storms, while the ghostly one-man doo-wop of “Heads or Tails” enhances its air of melancholy and regret through oh-so subtle but strategic chord changes. But those are rare instances where <i>Experiments in Time</i> feels like a blueprint for a more grandiose master plan; mostly, these songs just linger like an impenetrable mist (the codeine cabaret of “I Am” being the most suffocating), with precious little in the way of melodic logic or purposeful arrangement to give them any kind of shape or, more importantly, dramatic tension. This makes the anomalous closer “Now Is Gone” feel all the more startling, like a Band-Aid being ripped off your skin: by outfitting this beautifully bruised piano ballad in a tape-hiss patina and a vulnerable, frayed-nerve vocal, Beal offers us a glimpse of the more captivating album that could’ve resulted had he applied his bloodletting lyricism to equally raw and restless performances. Hopefully, <i>Experiments in Time</i> is something Beal just had to get out of his system during a moment of solitary reflection, before reconnecting with the gusto that made his previous albums so intriguing. While there is much to admire about Beal taking such an abrupt left turn at this crucial juncture in his trajectory, in this case, it’s one that, more often than not, leads to an aesthetic dead end.</p></div>"|19647.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19647-willis-earl-beal-experiments-in-time/|5.0|Stuart Berman

That album, the icy, insular, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Eno</a>-esque <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11866-pink-flag-chairs-missing-154/"">154</a></i>, became their swansong—at least, until they resurfaced with an updated, less punk-indebted sound via 1987’s <i>The Ideal Copy</i>. But there’s an often overlooked album that ushered out that first creatively abundant era of Wire: <i>Document and Eyewitness</i>. At the time a posthumous release, the 1981 record centered around an infamous concert in February of 1980 at London’s Electric Ballroom—a gig that would turn out to be Wire’s last for a long time. The concert’s infamy stems from the fact that, at that point in their evolution, Wire had pushed their art-student tendencies to the breaking point, turning what was expected to be a pogo-fueled punk show into a Dadaist, performance-art spectacle complete with Morris-dancing bells and a live goose.</p>
<p>Wire imploded onstage that night in a paradoxical mix of surreal exhibitionism and anticlimactic frustration. You had to be there—but most weren’t, and therein lies the eternal problem with <i>Document and Eyewitness</i>. The album is being given an expanded, remastered, and resequenced reissue, but it doesn’t change the reality of the recording’s technical flaws, not to mention the issues with the performance itself. The sound is unsteady and splotchy, and the band, always keen on deconstructing itself, has clearly taken that ethic to its inevitable dead end. The only song off Wire’s astounding first three albums—1977’s <i>Pink Flag</i>, 1978’s <i>Chairs Missing</i>, and 1979’s <i>154</i>—that they deign to play is their seminal punk hit, “12XU”. Well, they <i>kind of</i> play it: it’s introduced in a faux-crowd-pleasing sneer, then only a fraction of its riff is briefly performed, drone-like. For a song that was designed to feel fragmented in the first place, “12XU (Fragment)” is a gesture of contrarian conceptualism taken one level too far. </p>
<p>The appeal of <i>Document</i> isn’t its fidelity or comprehensiveness, but its small yet pivotal place in Wire’s continuity. A bounty of new compositions are busted out on the Electric Ballroom setlist, as well as the album’s eight other live tracks from around the same time. (The last of those non-Ballroom songs, “Heartbeat”, finally and authoritatively iterates an album track—in this case, the stark, eerie centerpiece of <i>Chairs Missing</i>). “5/10” lurches and echoes in a near-industrial thrum; “We Meet Under Tables” is a psychedelic waltz ostensibly designed to cause nausea. They burst with promise, and history has proven it; most of them wound up appearing in reworked, vastly improved form in the years to come—most notably on singer-guitarist Colin Newman’s third solo album, 1982’s <i>Not To</i>, and Wire’s own 2013 album, the superb <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17720-wire-change-becomes-us/"">Change Becomes Us</a></i>. Thirty-three years later, Wire’s powerful resurrection of those songs has rendered huge chunks of <i>Document </i>as smaller in sound and far less essential. </p>
<p>The remainder of <i>Document</i> is made up of a handful of rare studio tracks—including two singles, 1981’s “Our Swimmer” and 1983’s “Crazy About Love”, a handful of brittle, immaculate songs that would have felt right at home on <i>154</i>—and a clutch of clunky, lo-fi rehearsal recordings that overlap the live tracklist and add little to the overall listen. Two of those new additions to <i>Documents</i>, however, are insightful. “Ally in Exile” is an acoustic demo played solo by Newman—hushed, haunting, layered with shimmering effects—that far outstrips the full-band live version elsewhere on the album. And the fourteen-minute “Part of Our History… Emerges”<i> </i>is shambolic, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23514-public-image-ltd/"">Public Image Ltd.</a>-like jam packed with sarcastic, cut-and-paste references to Wire’s own album cuts, the ones they’d all but abandoned by then. “Practice makes perfect/ I’ve got sand in my joints,” sings Newman, taunting himself with the titles of two of the songs Wire fans would kill to hear performed live, then and now. That kind of perversity oozes from the album, and the expanded reissue has only made it thicker. Wire never wanted to be a satisfying band, yet they somehow became one—which leaves the otherwise bold impulse behind <i>Document and Eyewitness </i>curiously inconclusive. </p></div>"|19571.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19571-wire-document-and-eyewitness/|6.0|Jason Heller

The Los Angeles-via-Melbourne-via-Hamilton singer reportedly cut the already-overlong album down to 12 tracks from 70, leaving cherished collaborations with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9992-dave-longstreth"">Dave Longstreth</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5058-flying-lotus/"">Flying Lotus</a> to languish in a negative zone; while those ostensibly difficult decisions might suggest a ruthless approach to editing, the resulting album suggests that she's either a poor pick, leaving out some of her choicest shit, or doesn't know how to refine her ideas beyond adding to them until they sound overstuffed.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Gone is the alt-pop piper of ""Settle Down"" which had her lining up next to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4062-regina-spektor"">Regina Spektor</a>ites; in its place, Kimbra attempts to sub a sprawling, clamorous vision where pop music is all things at all times. Bold and vulnerable, naked and swaddled, topical and timeless; the desire to reconcile these contradictions is everywhere on <i>The Golden Echo</i>,<i> </i>but it's a struggle to untangle them. Polarizing first single ""90s Music"" acts as a mission statement for the rest of the album, milking yester-yesteryear's R&amp;B and flavoring it with <i>kawaii </i>affectation and a trap beat. ""90s Music"" sounds like it came from the temporal singularity, and if the other 11 tracks on <i>The Golden Echo </i>matched its coherence, it'd be an unmitigated success.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This potentially alienating take on pop places her as a contemporary of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10788-janelle-monae/"">Janelle Monáe</a>, except where Monáe's explicitly performative nature served as a rallying point for reconciling post-modern dehumanization and globalization, Kimbra seems too infatuated with the attendant spectacle to offer any comment. As an eclectic producer, Kimbra places herself to the left of the mainstream, but only just so: more straightforward tracks like ""As You Are"" and ""Nobody But You"", as well as the disco slink of ""Miracle"", alternate between lazy and capitulating modes. ""Miracle"" is perhaps the most egregious example of this occurrence: luscious, punchy, and faithful to the genre, ""Miracle"" could've been the strongest track on the album if it didn't drag on for a minute and a half too long. If ""90s Music"" is emblematic of <i>The Golden Echo</i>'s squandered potential for success, ""Miracle"" is emblematic of all its shortcomings.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In spite of all that, amongst this interminable mess are enough moments that show Kimbra to be one of the most adventurous pop artists going. <span>She nearly one-ups Passion Pit at their own game on the breezy, gluco-sick ""Carolina"", while the languid, lovelorn ""Rescue Him"" casts a distorted shadow of Justin Timberlake.</span> For now, though, Kimbra's status as ""That singer from the Gotye song"" woefully underserves her full potential, but so does <i>The Golden Echo.</i></p></div>"|19635.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19635-kimbra-the-golden-echo/|4.3|Jake Cleland

With a discography that stretches back to the late 1970s via bands like Ike Yard and Death Comet Crew and a dancefloor hit in 1984’s “The Dominatrix Sleeps Tonight”, Argabright is tough to slot. He has pioneered musical forms like no-wave, hip-hop, post-punk, leftfield disco, early industrial, and proto-techno (including releases on revered labels like <a href=""http://lesdisquesducrepuscule.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Disques du Crépuscule</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_Records"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Factory Records</a>), yet Argabright rarely receives mention in overviews. Electronic music festivals might overtake Gotham for month-long residencies to pay tribute to the city’s musical legends, yet none have given someone like Argabright his proper due.</p>
<p>Granted, Argabright carries a penchant to both reside and delve into the sounds of the shadows. In 2012, the London imprint Blackest Ever Black unearthed a soundtrack that Argabright collaborated on with fellow Death Comet Crew member Shinichi Shimokawa as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/32415-black-rain/"">Black Rain</a>. It was originally conceived and recorded for the disparaged 1995 sci-fi noir <i>Johnny Mnemonic, </i>a Keanu Reeves vehicle that's now nearly lost down the pop culture memory hole—but Argabright and Shimokawa’s soundtrack remains vital, even nearly two decades on. The dark pulsing tones of their work were resonant in the new century, especially in the more abrasive tones perpetuated by producers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8811-shackleton/"">Shackleton</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31301-sandwell-district/"">Sandwell District</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30495-vatican-shadow"">Vatican Shadow</a>, and labels like <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/l-i-e-s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">L.I.E.S.</a> With the duo’s first album in 18 years, <i>Dark Pool</i>, they plunge ever deeper into that chilly pitch-black template.</p>
<p>Age has in no way abated the duo’s penchant for isolating and building up alley-dark, harrowing tones out of their drum machines and hardware. A feminine robot voice at the album’s start suggests a glitching billboard leftover from <i>Blade Runner</i> and that mood carries throughout the turbid 11-track album. A stark vocal is set at the center of “Profusion”, and its balance between the ethereal female voice and foreboding electronics suggests <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22792-andy-stott/"">Andy Stott</a>’s work with Alison Skidmore's operatic vocals on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17205-luxury-problems/""><i>Luxury Problems</i></a>.</p>
<p>But where Stott would use the beat as a bludgeon, Argabright and Shimokawa prefer small and sharp needle-like sounds: Tibetan chimes, distant bashed metal, disembodied drones. Nearly five minutes into the album, a metallic beat breaks up the sinister ambience of “Watering Hole”, though it doesn’t remain in focus for long, the track giving away again to abstraction. Only on “Endourban” does a skittering, heart-quickening drum machine beat run throughout the track, the roars that rush around it suggesting a chase down an abandoned subway tunnel.</p>
<p>The songs at album’s center are the most visceral, showing how their influence on the likes of Sandwell District and Vatican Shadow might now reflect back on the duo like a mirror darkly. Distortion, overdriven circuitry, red alert arpeggios and metallic-plated drones rise and fall amid the throttling beats of tracks like “Burst” and “Data River.” The complex patterns that emerge on “Night in New Chiang Saen”—part EKG, part leaking pipe on a downed wire, part unmanned jackhammer—suggest early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"">Autechre</a>. Throughout, the productions of Argabright and Shimokawa move deep into queasy dark ambient territory, yet there’s a noir-ish, cinematic sense pervading every track, suggesting an imaginary film soundtrack, even if Keanu Reeves is nowhere to be seen.</p></div>"|19678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19678-black-rain-dark-pool/|7.5|Andy Beta

It’s not as if, since resurfacing from their post-<i>Pinkerton</i> hiatus back in 2001, they gradually turned into a less interesting, more pedestrian version of their younger selves (a la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"">the Rolling Stones</a>). They’ve intentionally become a total, aggressive affront to them, as if their entire post-millennial career has been one extended, James Franco-worthy performance-art stunt in baiting anyone whoever took them seriously. It’s hard to think of another band that has so eagerly created such a chasm between what they first presented themselves to be (in Weezer’s case, a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3268-pavement/"">Pavement</a> that could sell records) and what they turned out to be (a Smash Mouth that sold even more). And that cognitive dissonance is weighing on the hearts and minds of old-school fans all the more heavily this year, as we celebrate the 20<span style=""font-size: 12px;"">th</span> anniversary of <i>The Blue Album</i> while bracing for the next inevitably disappointing chapter in the history of a band that long ago stopped writing great songs in favor of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqZBAq2AdNc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">writing dumb songs about writing great songs</a>.</p>
<p>It may be a complete coincidence that Matt Sharp is dropping his first proper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3558-the-rentals/"">Rentals</a> album in 15 years smack dab in the middle of this fray, but it’s a welcome thrown-bone nonetheless for those who were first drawn to Weezer for their winsome underdog charm (which got pissed away forevermore sometime during the first talkbox solo on ""Beverly Hills""). It’s hard to say if Sharp was solely responsible for the enduring greatness of Weezer’s first two albums (though <a href=""http://www.mtv.com/news/1453586/former-weezer-bassist-matt-sharp-sues-band-over-royalties/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he has taken the band to court</a> to essentially prove as much), but it’s no exaggeration to suggest they were never the same after he left in '98. And where his solo vehicle the Rentals first surfaced as Weezer’s skinny-tied alter-ego—with breakout single “Friends of P” piggybacking on <i>The Blue Album</i>’s MTV momentum—it has since come to signify their complete anti-thesis: a sly psych-pop outfit that, despite an evermore ambitious scope and consistency of vision, remains humble and easily approachable in demeanor. </p>
<p>The Rentals have always been an opportunity for Sharp to play fantasy camp with a rotating cast of players, whether presenting the band as Cold War-relic Soviet tech-pop technicians on 1995’s debut/faux-comeback<i> Return of the Rentals</i>, or rounding up a leisure cruise of Britpop all-stars for 1999’s <i>Seven More Minutes</i>. However, <i>Lost in Alphaville</i> follows an extended, and only sporadically productive period of hibernation, marked by a somber country-rock-inspired song cycle issued under his own name in 2004 and a collection of ambient, piano-based instrumentals released as the Rentals in 2011 to benefit victims of the Tohoku earthquake and tsumani (but, understandably, wholly lacking in the sugar-buzzed pop generally associated with the brand). So when Sharp sings “it’s time to come home” on <i>Lost In Alphaville</i>’s splendorous opener of the same name, he’s not just setting some nostalgic childhood scene of moms summoning their kids for supper—the synth swirls, morse-code melodic tics, and fuzz-covered chug practically serve as beacons for Sharp himself to return to his comfort zone. </p>
<p>Once again, <i>Lost in Alphaville</i> reveals Sharp’s strengths as a casting director: moonlighting Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney lends the retooled Rentals some heretofore unrealized heft, while Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig of honky-tonk harmony outfit Lucius capably provide the “oohs” and “ahhs” once supplied by everyone from that dog’s Rachel and Petra Haden to a pre-<i>SNL</i> Maya Rudolph. With the sunbeamed pop highs of “Traces of Our Tears” and “1000 Seasons”, <i>Lost in Alphaville</i> essentially plays like<i> Return of the Return of the Rentals</i>, and the glammed-up “Stardust” even winks in the direction of the Rentals’ biggest single while acknowledging the scourge of one-hit-wonderdom (“Once, I had a friend/ A short-term friend/ But now she’s gone”). But all this retro-gazing isn’t just some convenient ploy to reintroduce this band to a '90s-nostalgic marketplace; as Sharp <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/blog/the-rentals-matt-sharp-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">has admitted</a>, <i>Lost in Alphaville</i> was inspired by a return to the Barcelona locale that informed the hedonistic narratives of <i>Seven More Minutes</i> and, as such, is the most pensive, sobering album in the Rentals’ canon, establishing a tension between the band’s gleaming futurist fantasias and a festering, dreams-unfulfilled ennui.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Sharp’s voice has turned less assertive, more conversational with age, not so much a singer anymore as a sigher. But while he wisely defers to Wolfe and Laessig to deliver the album's biggest hooks, his unwavering wistfulness still has a way of flattening out <i>Lost in Alphaville</i>’s emotional terrain and lending the album a steady-to-a-fault temperament, to the point where there’s little difference in impact between a downcast new-waved ballad like “Damaris” and an orchestro-rock gallop like “Irrational Things” (which imagines an alternate universe where Mercury Rev scored the Peach Pit After Dark gig on ""90210"" instead of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1504-the-flaming-lips/"">the Flaming Lips</a>). Fortunately, the album’s closer, “The Future”, proves to be something more than just another sci-fi-themed spin on the Rentals’ patented robo-rock. Breaking down his usual schematic into a flurry of backward loop effects, propellered percussion, and Dirty Projections-style vocal acrobatics, the track sees Sharp capping off an album that’s very much about looking back—upon his life and his band’s past sonic signatures—with a bold step into the unknown.</p></div>"|19596.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19596-the-rentals-lost-in-alphaville/|6.9|Stuart Berman

You know, besides everyone who’s heard a single note of their music. But Brian Fallon <i>has</i> to be fucking with us when he says that <i>Get Hurt</i> is “completely different than anything we had ever done before” and that it was inspired by “a lot of poetry books and a lot of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1177-bob-dylan/"">Bob Dylan</a>.” He should know this is inherently funny, because the Gaslight Anthem is a band almost exclusively defined by their relationship with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen"">Bruce Springsteen</a>, and now here they are, announcing a total artistic rebrand by namedropping the two main influences of the Boss’ earliest days. Here’s the thing, though—<i>Get Hurt</i> <i>is</i> completely different than anything the Gaslight Anthem has ever done, in large part because it <i>is</i> inherently funny. They just seem to be the only ones not in on the joke.</p>
<p>The running subtext is that Gaslight had as much Bon Jovi in them as they did Bruce, but it’s a subtle joke, since <i>Get Hurt</i> draws from a specific time when those guys were essentially two sides of the same coin: both are Jersey boys who packed stadiums with anthemic, synth-gilded rock songs that used role playing and blue-collar archetype to distract you from the storyteller’s celebrity. The main difference is that Bruce made you think he actually worked at a carwash, whereas Jon wanted you to think he was a fucking cowboy. There is nothing inherently wrong with Gaslight Anthem going this route; their whole cross-armed, “real rock ‘n roll” moralizing was tired even before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16856-handwritten""><i>Handwritten</i></a>, and more power to them if they turn out to be the rare band who can summon the endearing qualities of Jersey hair metal. Why should southern boys like Luke Bryan and Eric Church have all the fun these days?</p>
<p>The problem is that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12454-the-59-sound/""><i>The '59 Sound</i></a>’s still-pretty-awesome Eddie and the Cruisers mall-punk shtick is the only thing that comes naturally to the Gaslight Anthem, and while <i>Get Hurt</i> finds them admirably trying to do anything <i>but</i> that, the results are the strain of incompatible parts<span>—a</span> band with <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/magazine/is-gaslight-anthems-brian-fallon-the-true-heir-to-springsteen.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the heart of a Dodge Challenger</a> and the assembly line and plasticine production of a Kia. 99% of all Gaslight Anthem reviews fail to mention any other member besides Fallon, and it’s just as well; thanks to Mike Crossey’s atypically expensive-with-broke-taste production, Fallon might as well be emoting in front of a House of Blues version of Chuck E. Cheese’s animatronic band. When the title track fails to hold the line on Toto-style power balladry, you wish they were honest with themselves and hired Mutt Lange instead.</p>
<p>With every bungled attempt at pop, metal, or pop-metal, <i>Get Hurt</i> just rewrites its own worst case scenario. The plodding pentatonic riffs and dour, lower-octave vocal harmonies of “Stay Vicious” at the very least renounce any ties to previous Gaslight Anthem records, though a complete alt-grunge overhaul just results in a twang-free <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5579-manchester-orchestra"">Manchester Orchestra</a>. Throw in a stiff, stuffed-pants strut and a gospel choir on “1,000 Years”, and you’ve got the kind of radioactive song of the South that even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2353-kings-of-leon"">Kings of Leon</a> won’t touch anymore. On “Stray Paper”, Fallon’s vocals climb <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMN7qrwLr7E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">honky’s ladder</a> three rungs too high, strangulating, “You better never tell nobody but God all the things I’ve seen”; the only possible explanation is that he’s attempting an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/31-the-afghan-whigs"">Afghan Whigs</a> parody nobody asked for.</p>
<p>Still, <span>when all else fails, Fallon remains the focal point as the most sincere guy in rock, and </span><i>Get Hurt</i><span> is the first time he’s written exclusively in the first person.</span> Following his divorce, as well as a retreat from both substances and social media, he's got material to draw from—<span>and yet, he still maintain</span><span>s the same guys ‘n’ dolls vernacular, asking the listeners to meet the new Nathan Detroit, same as the old one.</span> During “Stay Vicious”, Fallon admits, “I still love rock'n'roll and I still call somebody ‘baby’.” Disregarding the rockism, sexism, mansplaining, and ageism that can be perceived in this lyric, it's easy to appreciate the honesty, at the least, of a guy admitting to being an anachronism. And he <i>is</i> true to his word<span>—</span>on numerous occasions throughout <i>Get Hurt</i>, he uses “baby” as a term of endearment.</p>
<p>For example: “Baby, I was born on the 4th of July/ Exploding like a firework”, a key lyric from “Rollin’ and Tumblin’”. <span>Point being, Fallon’s been working for so long within the iconography of “real music” that he can’t seem to express any </span><i>real</i><span> emotion without running it through some kind of Boss Babelfish filter.</span> There are two ways to hear him finish the line, “Since you only get high on the weekends, <i>uh-huh</i>”—either “Why don’t you feel me tonight” or “feed on me”—and this is from a song called “Helter Skeleton”. During “Red Violins”, Fallon gravely intones, “20 pounds of curses came to visit me tonight,” and even if it wasn’t a metaphor mixed three wrong ways, 20 pounds seems like a pretty manageable weight. And then there’s pitiable non-resonance of the title track: <span>“I think I’m gonna move to California/ Momma can you say a prayer for me?/ I heard they never get so lowdown/ I heard they never bleed...</span><i>not like we bleed</i><span>.” </span>Cue the cheers from the Stone Pony, but not before another damn grease monkey Greek chorus.</p>
<p>Credit where it’s due: this is Fallon’s divorce record <i>and</i> Gaslight Anthem’s “highly produced” synth-rock record, and yet they somehow didn’t just follow the path of least resistance towards recreating <i>Tunnel of Love</i>. Nor did they have any real incentive to change things up—not when they could probably just ride out their caricatured, blue collar punk-hagiographer thing into the Sunset Strip the same way Social Distortion do to this very day. And it’s still so completely sincere that every time you laugh at Fallon, you also feel some kind of pity, so the only thing they truly nailed on <i>Get Hurt </i>was the album cover: an inverted heart that just ends up looking like a cartoon ass.</p></div>"|19585.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19585-the-gaslight-anthem-get-hurt/|3.0|Ian Cohen

A band that seemed happy to take the piss out of their own garage-rock shamble suddenly found their swagger.</p>
<p><i>Hands on the Controls</i> is almost tentatively titled—like a teenager taking the wheel of the family car for the first time—while <i>Get Yer Body Next ta Mine</i> practically screams in its self-assertion. <i>Hands </i>was reissued last year, and now <i>Get Yer Body</i> is following suit; while it still doesn’t fall anywhere near the psychedelic richness of Dwyer’s subsequent band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5758-thee-oh-sees/"">Thee Oh Sees</a>, it works more weirdness into the gloriously lopsided equation. <i>Get Yer Body</i>’s best song, “1000 Years”, is robotic to the point of motorik, a sack of pure slop poured into a glistening, shivering skin. The sci-fi vibe goes deeper on “UFO, Please Take Her Home”, a Frankenstein’s-monster-in-zero-gravity stomper that starts and stops in a frenzy of thwarted, paranoiac inertia.</p>
<p>John Harlow’s drumming is a study in applied stupidity, all busted sticks and busted knuckles, but Mary Ann McNamara’s keyboards truly push Dwyer’s primal sound into other dimensions. Schoolyard taunts are translated into single-fingered organ lines, and they’re always half a hair off the beat and off-pitched, imparting an air of bruised discordance to an already abusive batch of songs. “I Put It In, Way Down South” is Dwyer at his most <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/21954-billy-childish/"">Billy Childish</a>-ish, employing his hero’s distinctively unhinged, riff-voice-riff-voice pattern like he’s toggling the light switch in a drunk tank full of troglodytes.</p>
<p>Strangely, it’s when Coachwhips eases up that <i>Get Yer Body</i> starts to really rock. “Yes, I’m Down” is the closest the record comes to approaching poignantly emotive fare, and while the song’s beat is frantic, its melody is stretched over a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3974-suicide"">Suicide</a>-like drone that evokes a hollow loneliness. The album’s title track is downright slow and ultimately clairvoyant, evidence that before Dwyer tired of rattling garage rock’s skeleton and began his quest for something more lush in Thee Oh Sees, he was already tinkering with creepy-crawly proto-psych.</p>
<p>The reissue of <i>Get Yer Body</i> has been remixed and remastered, and Dwyer has touted it as “loogie-shined,” but there isn't a vast sonic difference between the original release and this reissue. Mostly, the mud has been scraped off the edges and plopped back into the middle; there’s a heft and jolting clarity to all the fuzz, and the vague murkiness of the original recording has been replaced with a higher resolution. It doesn’t appreciably change the experience of hearing it, but it does signal the fact that Dwyer has started taking Coachwhips’ legacy a little more seriously. Garage rock once reveled in its own vaunted authenticity and organic messiness; everything needed to bleed, and many of the genre’s practitioners and fans still feel that way. But <i>Get Yer Body</i> was a big step toward demonstrating that garage didn’t need to be overly druggy and/or arty to be soulful and peculiar—and that, yes, there may even be room for nuance in these trashy pieces of mastery.</p></div>"|19648.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19648-coachwhips-get-yer-body-next-ta-mine/|8.0|Jason Heller
