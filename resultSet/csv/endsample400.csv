<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3683-ryuichi-sakamoto/"">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4986-christopher-willits/"">Christopher Willits</a> understand the importance of in-between spaces, those parts that principally function to serve the whole but often peel back to reveal tiny corners of fine-spun beauty. There are times on <i>Ancient Future</i>, the pair's follow-up to their 2007 collaboration <i>Ocean Fire</i>, when tracks slide into barely perceptible sound, only to gain a small foothold back into the lattice of muted piano clinks and computer-processed guitar strokes. That gentle sway between parts sometimes works as the dividing line between light and dark, or as the signal for far subtler shifts in tone and intonation. For an album so deeply entrenched in placidity, it's a surprise low-key thrill to try and figure out exactly where Sakamoto and Willits are heading once the inclination to make those switches occurs. The title <i>Ancient Future</i> works off a similar sense of flux, caught between the finished and the forthcoming, neatly reflecting the exact inverse of the album's conceptual reflection of the birth-life-death cycle.</p>
<p>Impressively, Sakamoto and Willits tackled such ambitious subject matter after the former sent the latter a series of piano pieces-- a method of composing that has often worked out well for Sakamoto in his other collaborative works. It's difficult to imagine the parts of these tracks being recorded separately, perhaps even with different ideas on the intent and scope of the project in mind. But somewhere in the process, the idea for <i>Ancient Future</i> was hatched, with its six entirely instrumental tracks designed to encompass the human experience, touching on certain fundamental turns along the way. However, there's nothing remotely earthborn about this material, as long-term fans of either artist won't be surprised to learn. Instead, this feels like a view from the heavens, a remote observation of humankind conducted from a distant star.</p>
<p>As such there's a strong sense of detachment throughout this record, of two forces awkwardly trying to understand one another, neatly reflecting the disconnect in Sakamoto and Willits' respective recording processes. The stuttered guitar line that does a tipsy dance across great sheets of processed ambient noise on ""Abandoned Silence"" nurtures that sense of unrefined communication. <i>Ancient Future</i> is an album where the parts don't all fit together naturally, but it's all the stronger for it. It works as a near-perfect reflection of the album's bigger themes, of our attempts to make sense of the world while trying to find the right path and so often stumbling in the process. The playing on ""I Don't Want to Understand"" is masterfully poised on top of a great glacial drone, but Sakamoto and Willits chip great chunks out of it through off-key piano parts and shifting, itchy welts of noise. On ""Releasing"" they reach a natural endpoint in their love of seesawing between different textures, letting great swells of elegance swoon into gigantic sunbursts of sound and then back into much smaller terrain.</p>
<p>Those parts of <i>Ancient Future</i> are where it feels like Sakamoto and Willits are toying with us, trying to manipulate our emotions by constantly leaving the listener dangling in the unexpected for a few tantalizing seconds. On the aptly titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13772-completion/"">""Completion""</a> they achieve their most harmonious manifestation of that tendency, with the two players edging toward songcraft and away from the tone-float that makes up much of this album. The fact that they don't quite get there, leaving ""Completion"" untethered in a place that's neither entirely immersed in drift or something more concrete, further heightens the sense of restlessness that gives <i>Ancient Future</i> its curiously alluring backbone. This album peaks when it finds room to tilt at larger topics and tinier ones within a few short seconds of one another. By never fully bedding down in one place it further emphasizes the sense of journey that is fundamental to the human experience, of floundering to find the most logical path to get to where you want to go and having to take an unfathomably circuitous route to even get near it.</p>

Frontman Phil Swanson's piercing wail pairs high-flying Ozzyisms with theatric harmonies and verses so pensive you'd swear he was cupping a chalice. Arranger and multi-instrumentalist Chad Davis wraps massive, squealing solos through most every space he can. It's a sound that Jack Black might conjure for his next rock'n'roll hero. Meanwhile, the title and cover of Hour of 13's latest and third album, <i>333</i>, both seem custom-crafted by a marketing firm you'd never hire: ""Let's cut the Number of the Beast in half, because everyone loves a good Crowley reference, etch it into a big-jawed skull lit by candlelight, and put it in the middle of three gold-embossed triangles. And don't forget the freak-show font. Those dark kids will just love it.""</p>
<p>While their gestures and symbols are inarguably mawkish and predictable, even in a field with an unending history of such, Hour of 13's swill of lurching Saint Vitus-style doom and gymnastic New Wave of British Heavy Metal technique makes the band itself a rarity-- an act evidently reverent to its stylistic forebears but energized as if they'd invented this music themselves. ""Deny the Cross"" takes the lead for <i>333</i>; it's a passionate, dynamic expanse, shifting between moments of head-banging rumble and psychedelic smear. On ""Rite of Samhain"", Davis inlays crisscrossing guitars above a basic rhythm section, a prototypical doomy chug offset by kinetic bursts cutting constantly through the track. Swanson's voice is masterful, occasionally doubling and tripling itself to foster a sense of spectacle. The duo's transitions-- whether a basic drum fill or quick and extended guitar lick-- serve these songs well, too, helping the pieces Davis and Swanson put together actually stay that way.</p>
<p>Indeed, Hour of 13's most audacious tracks are, at least on <i>333</i>, also their best. ""Lucky Bones"" and ""The Burning"", the two multi-part tunes that break the eight-minute mark, overcome the obvious stylistic touchstones from sheer force of will, allowing the disbelief-- an American crew in 2012, making this music so well, in the South-- not to be simply suspended but almost forgotten altogether. After a compelling intro that touches at the edge of stoner metal, ""The Burning"" lets Swanson set up his story-- essentially, the cost of sin is damnation, and now you are burning, so whatever, mortal. The song's middle third picks up the pace to, if you will, turn up the heat on the same topic. ""Divorced from salvation,"" Swanson sings over one of the record's best sprints, ""into damnation."" The shift in speed works, somehow making Swanson's warning about an embroiled eternity seem great-- the kind of stuff that, several decades ago, you might've pumped your fist to in an outsized arena. Closer ""Lucky Bones"" triggers back and forth between mid-tempo quake, squealing solos, and an inescapable chorus, with several short, forlorn sections lending appropriate gravity to the song's observations on burial, or being ""given to the dust."" Again, these sprawls work because they're so very immersive, temporarily beating back Hour of 13's revivalist stigma.</p>
<p>But if this music already exists within a canon so well-established to not only have classics but successors who have pushed those sounds into dizzying new realms, why bother listening to it? It's a query that <i>333</i> refuses to approach or ease; there are no nods to funeral doom, noise or abstraction at large here, no post-modern referents to prompt lengthy features in <i>The New York Times</i> or the <i>New Yorker</i>. Hour of 13-- or at least this lineup, featuring Swanson and Davis-- broke up and reunited since the release of their 2010 album, <i>The Ritualist</i>. Swanson temporarily yielded the frontman throne. It's nearly possible to perceive that difficult delivery here within the enthusiasm and earnestness with which these seven songs are offered; Swanson and Davis play them hard, fast, and fun, a quality that might just be the record's chief surprise. In playing these tunes like they nearly never recorded them, Hour of 13 recharge the music of Cathedral, Candlemass, and Pentagram rather than simply remake it.</p></div>"|17002.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17002-333/|6.6|Grayson Currin

This was in August 2010, and his <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7940-odd-future-mixtapes/"" target=""_blank"">Rolling Papers</a> </i>was for many listeners the first introduction to the crew's disorienting, insular world. It also raised a simple question: What is all the fuss about? The album was low-key and low-ambition-- it was, after all, called <i>Rolling Papers</i>. It showed that Domo lacked <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29179-tyler-the-creator/"" target=""_blank"">Tyler, the Creator</a>'s force of personality or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29180-earl-sweatshirt/"" target=""_blank"">Earl Sweatshirt</a>'s prodigious wordplay, and its influences (MF Doom, Wiz Khalifa) were obvious. It's also a fairly agreeable record, and that too cut against the rapidly growing narrative of Odd Future's divisiveness.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Now, of course, things are much clearer. As the members of Odd Future continue to splinter off for individual projects, it's easier to see where they fit into the puzzle. Domo is still low-key-- as a rapper he seems to have little interest in the type of controversy Tyler craves-- but it would be hard to call him low-ambition anymore. If there's one thing that stood out about the crew's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16421-the-of-tape-vol-2/"" target=""_blank"">OF Tape Vol. 2</a> </i>from March, it was the force with which Domo is now rapping. Contrary to what we heard on <i>Rolling Papers</i>, Domo Genesis is taking rapping seriously.</p>
<p class=""p2"">That increased professionalism is carried over to <i>No Idols</i>, Domo's new collaborative album with producer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30578-the-alchemist/"" target=""_blank"">the Alchemist</a>. Being serious about the art of rapping is far from a virtue in and of itself (as, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28215-slaughterhouse/"" target=""_blank"">Slaughterhouse</a> proves). But with Domo it coincides with his evolution into a surprisingly good technical rapper. He's no star, but <i>No Idols </i>is a very solid record. It's the sort of thing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29043-curreny/"" target=""_blank"">Curren$y</a> has made a career out of.</p>
<p class=""p2"">It's refreshing to hear Domo carry his own record, but the masterstroke of <i>No Idols </i>is his pairing with the Alchemist, whose beats fit the shift in Domo's career. Where <i>Rolling Papers</i> leaned hard on bright, airy keyboards, the Alchemist's productions are strictly in the lineage of the sort of East Coast lyricism that Domo is now nodding to. His beats here are strong in their own right, but never try to compete with the rappers. That stands in stark contrast to the jarring melodicism that peppers Tyler's production work on <i>Rolling Papers</i>. Alchemist's beats are dark and noirish, but not in a way that intends to convey malice. The tones are almost soft to the touch, with a vibe of relaxation and playfulness that keeps things from feeling too serious. One example is ""All Alone"", which features a cooing female vocal sample rubbing up against some grunting likely taken from a kung-fu film. But there's also the weed tribute ""Me and My Bitch"", which is built on undulating keyboards that paw at your face.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Domo still gets outshined here when Earl or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"" target=""_blank"">Action Bronson</a> show up, but he's not out of his league. His type of internal rhyming (""Oh so cocky, you can't stop me in this ol' Versace"") also isn't spectacular, but it's certainly above workmanlike. There's also a powerful exuberance in his voice that feels fresh and invigorating, and it's crucially far from the snide and aggrieved shit-talking you often hear from contemporary rappers who work within the same frame. Domo is probably never going to be the standout member of Odd Future, but <i>No Idols </i>is a better album than the amateurish <i>Rolling Papers </i>indicated could be in store. His decision to team up with the Alchemist shows a judicious, deft touch, and that alone is encouraging.</p></div>"|16957.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16957-no-idols/|7.4|Jordan Sargent

Those are the words Yoni Wolf uses to break a three-year silence (following the release of 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13450-eskimo-snow/"" target=""_blank"">Eskimo Snow</a></i>), and silence is certainly out of character for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4593-why/"" target=""_blank"">WHY?</a><i>.</i> Wolf's always erred on the side of oversharing, and the rapid succession of his band's two best LPs (2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11254-alopecia/"" target=""_blank""><i>Alopecia </i></a>and <i>Eskimo Snow</i>) suggested that a solidified lineup had inspired a period of artistic fertility. Yet while <i>Sod in the Seed EP </i>picks up where WHY? left off, it sounds like a regression rather than a rightful claim to what's theirs. For the first time, a band that always follows its wildly erratic muse sounds the way they think <i>you</i> want them to.</p>
<p>This much is clear from the overall sonic character of <i>Sod</i>, which ties up the loose ends from <i>Eskimo Snow</i>, a musically sedate but artistically unstable record. Wolf's voice has always been incapable of sounding traditionally ""pretty,"" but it caused an interesting friction as the band incorporated acoustic guitars, piano, and post-rock percussion. Most of this six-track EP recalls the indie hip-hop hybrids of <i>Alopecia's </i>""Fatalist Palmistry"", ""A Sky For Shoeing Horses Under"", and ""Good Friday""-- if not hits, then at least that record's most-quoted songs. The title track here is every bit as maddeningly sticky as ""Palmistry"", But whereas the latter was a cathartic reprieve amidst <i>Alopecia</i>'s heft, everything comes too easy on ""Sod in the Seed"", its sing-song hooks and self-satisfied pop culture references instantly triggering repressed memories of post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"" target=""_blank"">Beck</a> alterna-rappers like Bran Van 3000 and Citizen King.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">More disheartening is that Wolf's lyrics are typically awkward, but in a rare way that doesn't appear to be intentional. He sighs, ""I'll never shirk this first-world curse/ A steady hurt/ And a sturdy purse,"" which is essentially the underlying moral of almost every WHY? song-- the sort of incurable psychosexual drama that tends to afflict people whose immediate needs are met, allowing them the ability to feel crazy <i>and </i>guilty. We often get caught up in pointless arguments as to whether or not they're ""real"" problems or worth documenting, but it's ultimately a moot point since Wolf forfeits any sort of insight or resonance by playing so close to type. He's not even picking at low-hanging fruit so much as scooping up rotten apples-- ""hybrid cars,"" MacBooks, Critical Mass, orthodox Jews, expensive publicists, poorly compensated bloggers. Obviously, there's the tacit acknowledgment that Wolf uses #stuffwhitepeoplelike as a means of mocking himself, but on <i>Alopecia, </i>namedropping Whole Foods and SMS texts served as a means to an emotionally expressive end. The dispiriting devolution from keen, resonant observation to some kind of verbal prop comedy inevitably brings to mind <i>Travistan;</i> not a comparison made for kicks.</p>
<p>Despite the sturdy look of the tracklist, the EP clocks in at around 15 minutes, about a third of which is taken up by ""Sod in the Seed"", which is also the only one that will reappear on their upcoming full-length <i>Mumps, etc</i>. But while Wolf has previously been at his best going into as uncomfortable detail as possible, strangely enough, <i>Sod </i>actually benefits from the sketch-like character of its remaining songs.<i></i> At first, the brevity of ""Probable Cause"" grates-- in subject matter and length, it's basically a hardcore punk song or hip-hop skit. Yet there's a compact emotional arc in Wolf's pouring his heart out to a cop at a DUI stop who then lets him go on his way after a backhanded insult. While ""For Someone"" is definitely disjointed musically, its merger of Asian drums and chimes is as ornate and complicated as the trapdoor contraption described in its lyrics, the sound of WHY? trying something new and making use of its unconventional and polyrhythmic live set-up.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Later, ""Twenty Seven"" pulls a typical Wolf feint, describing in pitch-black detail what he's <i>thinking </i>so that you'll think, ""oh, well at least he's not <i>doing </i>that,"" in this case, plucking feathers from a bird like a daffodil's petals and making a birthday present out of its bones. Immediately after, ""Shag Carpet"" is <i>another </i>one of Wolf's lyrical feints, the confession-as-come-on and, as with ""Sod in the Seed"", it distills Wolf's dating profile into one line: ""But heed this honey, even if I beg for relations/ You should try to only keep me as a distant acquaintance/ Yeah, but I'm too persistant for that to work and what's worse/ Is when you finally fall asleep I'm gonna go through your purse."" It's one hell of a sign-off and while some might consider the Zooey Deschanel namedrop to be the most on-the-nose here, it's warranted by the juxtaposition with ""my ex-girlfriend"" in making a grim joke about the two most attractive women in a certain kind of man's life. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But to get there, you have to scythe through so many overripe zingers about buying parkas at Marshalls, wearing togas to Kroger, and other admissions that read like ""Good Friday"" ran through a thesaurus. The problem with ""Shag Carpet"" and the <i>Sod in the Seed EP </i>as a whole isn't the content of Wolf's neuroses, nor is it the use of unfettered honesty in the hopes that someone might relate and both parties feel a bit less crazy. It's more that there actually is a low-level insanity in rehashing so many of WHY?'s musical and lyrical themes, that<i> </i>of doing the same thing again and expecting a different result.</p></div>"|16925.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16925-sod-in-the-seed/|5.2|Ian Cohen

Soon to be reissued, the earliest Wishmountain records made wonky funk out of sampling kitchen implements and consumerist detritus. It was as if a Hollywood sound designer had grown tired of recreating the sound of hooves with coconut shells, and instead put his talents to work as a left-field beatmaker. </p>
<p>Wishmountain has been more or less mothballed since the turn of the millennium. Meanwhile Herbert has only grown in status as both producer and go-to public intellectual in a modern dance scene that's apolitical at best and anti-intellectual at worst. Mostly, that means he gives good and contentious interviews, since his politics are mostly (and blessedly) confined to his music's praxis and the framework of promoting each record. At his best, he's even funny with it, in a goofy gallows humor sort of way.</p>
<p>The politics of <i>Tesco</i>, the first Wishmountain release in more than a decade, definitely fall on the cheeky side. You might not even take it as an album with a political bent, if you weren't familiar with Herbert's basic stance. And you're certainly able to enjoy the album without a shred of background info on how it was made or what it was made out of. That said, <i>Tesco</i> was purportedly crafted entirely from samples made by manipulating the staple sellers at Tesco, a low-price supermarket chain in the UK that's almost as huge and monopolizing as Walmart. It's pretty funny, to me at least, that Herbert has fashioned a highly personalized and doggedly odd little instrumental techno album, a plunge back into his spikiest and most idiosyncratic pseudonym, all out of the crud you can buy for cheap at a fluorescent-lit temple to mass-production culture. </p>
<p>Choosing to sample the waste products of late capitalism is a little bit of knowledge that he hopes might linger in the listener's mind, if they know the track's backstory. How seriously you take this, whether it seems like a subtle and legit form of protest or agitprop window-dressing on music that doesn't need it, is up to you. You're allowed to think this is pretentious and misguided-- the world's not going to stop producing planet-killing amounts of garbage because an English egghead tsk-tsk'd them via a dance record-- while still enjoying the records. Personally, I find Herbert's commitment charming, even weirdly inspiring in its quixotic-ness. </p>
<p>As usual with Herbert's work, leaving politics or even theory-driven art aside for a moment, <i>Tesco</i> is fun on two levels. One is trying to figure what samples were used, how he transformed them, what that awesomely weird noise might actually be. Because very little on <i>Tesco</i> actually <i>sounds</i> like crumpled-up candy wrappers or someone smacking a milk bottle. Could Herbert really make an entire alien-sounding but surprisingly groovy album from a palette of sounds of consumerist junk (and junk food) found at a massive chain grocery store? That bracing blast of airplane-taking-off noise that blows through the jittery funk contraption called ""Lucozade""? Someone blowing on the top of a bottle and then digitally blasting that mouth-noise all to hell? </p>
<p>This is the ""having fun with conceptual art"" level, also known as the ""puzzling out the magician's tricks"" level. Within the content-free confines of instrumental dance music, it's not to be discounted. Because without that, or a singer's personality to grab onto, or a cop to songform that gives you a hum-worthy chorus you long to hear again, you're otherwise left with little following the hiccups and pivots of Herbert's grooves for however many minutes. Good thing those hiccups and pivots are pretty unpredictable.</p>
<p>This is the other level of <i>Tesco</i>'s fun, taking familiar genre templates and scribbling madly outside their lines without wholly effacing them, offering tracks that provide the basic feel of stuff you already like but cast in itchy and ever-evolving new forms. Like the way ""Walkers"" (the British name for Lay's chips) would be fierce minimal party techno if it didn't keep growing these weird-but-ear-grabbing patches of gnarly distortion. And for those who prefer to take their beats straight-up but want a little more variety than usual, Herbert hasn't lost his knack for using his real-world samples to fashion hi-hats and kicks that buzz and snarl in ways no drum machine would. ""Coke"" hearkens back to Herbert's timbre-drunk early records, where he helped to invent what came to be known as micro-house, and where each tiny beat in a given bar seems to have its own luxuriously grainy texture.</p>
<p>Being an album that relies on the pleasures of sculpting unexpected source material into delicate and woozy grooves, or banging and freaky grooves, definitely makes <i>Tesco</i> a harder sell than one of Herbert's own tweaked attempts at mass appeal, such as, say, his brilliant turn as pop-producer-for-hire on Róisín Murphy's <i>Ruby Blue</i> or his own showbiz extravaganza with <i>Scale</i>. For those seeking to escape the big dumb blare of mainstream house and techno in 2012, however, <i>Tesco</i> is a balm. And for a minor work by a major artist, it's proof that even when certain smart people consciously aim for a low-stakes project, they still can't help bringing a certain baseline of invention and personality to it. Restlessness with the ordinary is probably to be expected with Herbert, even for a record that feels like a breather until his next big-canvas project.</p></div>"|16958.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16958-tesco/|6.3|Jess Harvell

She often plays and records with other musicians, yet her solo work remains impervious to their influence or external factors such as trends or technological advancement. On <i>Wavelength</i>, her sixth album, she's still living in her own private sound-world-- you could even say she's retreated further into it. This despite the fact that since her last effort, 2009's<i> Future Slip</i>, she's been as busy as ever, playing in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3874-thurston-moore/"" target=""_blank"">Thurston Moore</a>'s band (and now <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30568-chelsea-light-moving/"" target=""_blank"">Chelsea Light Moving</a>) as well as in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29560-metal-mountains/"" target=""_blank"">Metal Mountains</a>. But <i>Wavelength</i> sounds as though it could have been recorded a day after<i> Future Slip</i>.</p>
<p>This stubborn consistency works because Lubelski's sound itself is hermetic. Her brand of subdued closet-pop, with its gentle melodies, restrained instrumentation, and muted production, could have gone directly from her mind to tape. That's especially true of her captivating singing, a low-key purr which sounds like she's covering her mouth with her hand and whispering a secret in your ear. Which is perhaps why songs as simple and consistent as hers can, if you're inclined toward her particular kind of spell-casting, send small shivers up your spine and raise goose bumps on your skin.</p>
<p>On <i>Wavelength</i>, that effect comes most often from the quicker, fuller pieces. A brisker pace and more active mix allows Lubelski to smartly sneak her charms into your ears. The snaky curves of ""Jammage Cruiser"" and ""Hang of Summer"" genuinely sound like magic, with their sparkly accents and wrap-around melodies. When she revs up even more, as with the title track's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">Velvet Underground</a>-ish chug, that magic expands geometrically. But when she backs off, her tunes have a tendency to blur together. It's a sweet, enjoyable blur, but one most likely to click with those for whom Lubelski's understated approach has inherent appeal. These songs don't sell themselves, and their subtlety makes them naturally narrow.</p>
<p>Lubelski actually has made a few gems in the past that sounded like they could find a broader spotlight-- take the horn-laden ""Sister Silver"" from 2005's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4999-spectacular-of-passages/"" target=""_blank""><i>Spectacular of Passages</i></a>, or the catchy organ of ""The Cloistered Palace"" from 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11035-parallel-suns/"" target=""_blank""><i>Parallel Suns</i></a>. But even those tunes had a personal, voice-in-head feel, which ultimately distinguishes anything Lubelski does. I'd rather hear her play with shadows than light anyway, and on <i>Wavelength</i> she's still happily tucked into her own shrouded corner, making music that works because she's the one who made it.</p></div>"|16955.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16955-wavelength/|6.9|Marc Masters

A sinister expanse of ghosted voices and impenetrable squall, that kicker sounded a lot like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28801-locrain/"" target=""_blank"">Locrian</a>, the Chicago ensemble that cuts the attack from harsh noise and heavy metal until all that's left seems to be an atmosphere of decay and disorder. As a closer, the piece offered not only a clear contrast to the album's bulk of primal, claustrophobic black metal but also an arrow of sorts, a signpost saying that guitarist Ryan Lipynsky and drummer Tim Call hoped to push past their own <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1274-darkthrone/"" target=""_blank""><i>Panzerfaust</i></a> predilections. Basic black metal, they suggested, wasn't enough.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Five years later, on their latest and best album to date, <i>Of Babalon</i>, the bicoastal pair finally finds that promised transcendent identity, even if it's in unexpected fashion: Aside from the prelude or postscript segments that bookend several of its tracks,<i> Of Babalon</i> actually eschews all of the post-metal experimentation that the Howling Wind once looked to espouse. Rather, with a closing cover of Hellhammer's classic ""Horus/Aggressor"" and eight originals that hit hard, fast and often, the Howling Wind's third album retrenches in its black metal dependence, much like 2010's half-there <i>Into the Cryosphere</i>. ""Abominations and Filth"" moves with sheer two-piece willpower between mid-tempo thrash and blast-beaten bursts, scabrous vocals uniting it all; ""Beast of the Sea"" opens with terrifying aims, as Lipynsky shrieks over Call's roiling tumult in a way that suggests <a href=""http://fc08.deviantart.net/fs27/f/2008/086/2/5/Transilvanian_Hunger_For_Pizza_by_alcholocaust.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the cover of <i>Transilvanian Hunger</i></a>. What's more, the album's muse, Babalon, is the leading lady of Aleister Crowley's theology, a complicated character rife with questions about sexuality and fertility, sexism and feminism; maybe apart from the devil himself, and for all their mysticism and symbolism, Crowley's subjects and sermons make for some of the most able black metal fodder. Here, the Howling Wind treats the topic with convincing enthusiasm. Lipynsky finally sounds like a great frontman, bold and unwavering in his admonitions. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Of Babalon</i>'s mark of distinction, though-- really, what makes this album one of the year's most noteworthy black metal bunches-- is the way in which Call and Lipynsky wedge a lot of activity into a rather limited space. Though there are plenty of stretches here that suggest the primacy of prototypical black metal, the Howling Wind subtly splice enough odd elements into their tracks to keep that definition applicable but churning. ""Graal"", for instance, is the album's triumphant masterpiece and a study in sustaining momentum for nearly six minutes. It feels almost like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26785-kralice/"" target=""_blank"">Krallice</a> in miniature, fitting since that band's Colin Marston recorded this LP in New York. Lipynsky's tessellated guitar splits every seam of Call's relentless drum line, spilling over the sides in enormous washes and waves. The twin solos during opener ""The Seal Upon the Tomb"" are exhilarating, with spires of notes wrapping around themselves and twisting skyward so as to suggest some album-rock apex. Neither Lipynsky nor Call sit still as players, either-- Call delivers mid-tempo builds alongside all-out blasts, while Lipynsky emerges as a more assured and dynamic guitarist. He switches between a doomy bellow and a serrated yell, a range that allows the Howling Wind to insert and capitalize on stylistic surprises.</p>
<p class=""p1"">As good as <i>Of Babalon</i> is, the Howling Wind still seem very much in development-- a statement both of criticism and hopeful expectation. Each of their albums have shown that this duo is still undecided as to how best to skew black metal, or how best to revitalize something old in an already crowded scene. <i>Of Babalon</i> is certainly the closest they've come, but it's difficult not to wish that this were more than a side project for either member. In the past, Lipynsky, who lives in New York, has kept busy with the shapeshifting of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9512-unearthly-trance/"" target=""_blank"">Unearthly Trance</a> and the grim burl of Thralldom. Aside from this duo, he now growls the lead in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30599-serpentine-path/"" target=""_blank"">Serpentine Path</a>, a supergroup so overstocked that its official biography fails to mention the Howling Wind at all. Meanwhile, Call lives in Portland, Ore., where he plays in at least three other outfits, including the unflinching, audacious doom experts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30403-aldebaran/"" target=""_blank"">Aldebaran</a>. So what would the Howling Wind be as a full-time, touring concern, where the mass of ideas Call and Lipynsky have explored during the last five years served as a substantive foundation instead of fragmented moments captured quickly in a given studio?</p></div>"|16999.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16999-of-babalon/|7.3|Grayson Currin

In 1997, at age 40, he released his most delicate, introspective album, <i>The Boatman's Call</i>, to universal acclaim, making it the go-to Nick Cave album for people who never really liked Nick Cave. And then, thanks to a sober-up sabbatical, the usually prolific songwriter took four years to follow it up with the ornate <i>No More Shall We Part</i>; by 2002, this one-time contemporary of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2557-lydia-lunch/"" target=""_blank"">Lydia Lunch</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a> was covering the Beatles' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjEJxr538ZA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Let It Be""</a> alongside the likes of Sheryl Crow and Sarah McLachlan on the soundtrack to the Sean Penn TV-movie-of-the-week-style weepie <i>I Am Sam</i>. Cave had never made a secret of his admiration for the likes of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen; now, it seemed he was content to settle into a similar late-career routine of steadily releasing respectable albums that would allow him to grow old with his aging fans, rather than court new ones.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But if Cave's course seemed predetermined at the start of the decade, the final installments in Mute's 25th anniversary (28th anniversary by now) Bad Seeds reissue campaign cover a period of great upheaval and rejuvenation. Of course, the sense of rediscovery here is undermined by the fact that these records are still in print and fresh in memory, and the trajectory they chart feels incomplete without the inclusion of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5203-grinderman/"" target=""_blank"">Grinderman</a>, the more feral Bad Seeds offshoot that formed over this span. But, collectively, these records provide rare evidence of a band that continues to produce to career-besting work well into their third decade.  And as per the series standard, each album here has been repackaged with B-sides, 5.1-channel stereo DVD audio mixes, videos, and the final chapters of Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard's always-illuminating talking-head documentaries <i>Do You Love Me Like I Love You</i>-- albeit, sadly, with 90% less <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdBrATEMPjM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blixa</a>.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">At the very least, these reissues should reassert the importance of <i>Nocturama</i> in the Bad Seeds canon, given that the album's jarring stylistic shifts were initially greeted with an equally divisive reception. Where <i>No More Shall We Part</i> reasserted the Bad Seeds' rock-noir majesty in gradual, controlled gestures, <i>Nocturama</i> is more like a loosely screwed light bulb that flickers on and off in spurts. Eight of its 10 songs capture Cave in piano-man crooner mode, at times to overly sentimental effect-- see: ""Rock of Gibraltar"", a song destined to go down as Cave's ""Mull of Kintyre"". But <i>Nocturama</i> marked the start of a fruitful reunion between Cave and his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22521-the-birthday-party/"" target=""_blank"">Birthday Party</a> producer Nick Launay, and is ultimately remembered for its two outliers: the Grinderman dry-run ""Dead Man in My Bed"" and the incomparable ""Babe, I'm on Fire"", a breathless 15-minute, 38-verse tour de farce that provides a peak-power showcase of both the Bad Seeds' sleazeball swagger and Cave's peerless wordsmithery. It is, in essence, a love song to kill all other love songs, personifying the manic ecstasy of romance through kinship with an ""unlucky amputee,"" ""menstruating Jewess,"" ""rapist on a roll,"" and 100-plus other wayward souls seemingly on-call from some bizarro-world reality-TV show.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Beyond reawakening the Bad Seeds' inner beast, <i>Nocturama</i> signaled a shift in Cave's songwriting perspective. His lyric sheet up to that point had been mostly a pastiche of old-school signifiers, drawing on the blues, the Bible, and the Beats. But <i>Nocturama</i> revealed a growing interest in the modern world, America specifically. And while Cave's work has never been lacking for black humor, <i>Nocturama</i> evinced a greater willingness to embrace the absurd (as epitomized by the outrageous videos that accompany <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcJGalE3vn0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Babe""</a> and lead single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elaHaLl8T1k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Bring It On""</a>). It follows, then, that Cave's next release would embody his own funhouse-mirror view of life during wartime: Arriving just in time for Dubya's second term, 2004's double-album opus <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11700-abattoir-bluesthe-lyre-of-orpheus/"" target=""_blank""><i>Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orpheus</i></a> deviously blurred the line between religious-fundamentalist fervor and bloodthirsty savagery.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Recorded live off the floor in Paris' historic Studio Ferber, the 17-song set is, to my ears, the Bad Seeds' most visceral, vibrant recording to date, thanks in great part to an omnipresent church choir that serves less as a vessel for spiritual uplift than a sneering critique of organized religion. (From the gate-crashing opener ""Get Ready for Love"": ""Praise Him till you forgot what you're praising Him for/ Then praise Him a little bit more."") The Bad Seeds' first recording without the corrupting influence of long-time guitar-scraper Blixa Bargeld, <i>Abattoir Blues</i> compensates for his dissonant edge with pure gospel punk muscle, while <i>Lyre of Orpheus</i> elevates Cave's balladeer guise to a grand, widescreen scale. But, in their own unique ways, both present a response to the looming threat of holy war: where <i>Abattoir</i>'s ""Hiding All Away"" sadistically champions it as cause for celebration (""There is a war coming!""), <i>Orpheus</i>' mournful closer ""Carry Me"" and ""O Children"" constitute last-ditch pleas for salvation.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;""> </span> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>Abattoir/Orpheus</i> was going to be a hard act to follow and, judging by the lack of outtakes on offer here, one that drew the creative well dry at the time. But instead of trying to top it, Cave wisely stripped down, hijacking fellow Bad Seeds Sclavunous, Warren Ellis, and Martyn Casey for a barrage-rock regression-therapy session as Grinderman. The satellite band further mined Cave's growing obsession with American pop culture and was enthusiastically received by old and new Cave fans alike. But its ultimate purpose may have well been to serve as a sort-of Bad Seeds boot camp. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11375-dig-lazarus-dig/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!</i></a> scraped away Grinderman's surface squall, but retained its streetwise, dick-swinging attitude (and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd85SK7dESU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">porn-star 'taches</a>). And true to its conflation of the sacred and the profane-- resurrecting the New Testament's Lazarus as a hustler in modern-day New York City-- <i>Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!</i> is at once the Bad Seeds' most classic rockin' album to date (with ""Today's Lesson"" built upon the ""Jenny says"" template of the Velvets' ""Rock &amp; Roll""), and its most sonically adventurous, as heard in the eerily disembodied krautrock of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb5g23u2zw0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Night of the Lotus Eaters""</a> (though, sadly, the bonus disc neglects to include the more menacing version the Bad Seeds used to open shows on their 2008 tour).</p>
<p>Cave turned 50 during <i>Lazarus</i>' recording, but the only hints of aging arise when he turns the pen on himself and his process: Just as the <i>Abattoir Blues</i> standout ""There She Goes, My Beautiful World"" rendered writer's block as an apocalyptic affliction, <i>Lazarus</i>' centerpiece, ""We Call Upon the Author"", keys in on the existential crisis of the 21st century scribe, who's duty-bound to educate the oblivious ""idiot constituency"" and ""myxomatoid kids"" while struggling to measure up to the greats. (""Berryman was the best! He wrote like wet papier-mâché!"") It's a hilarious song-- and all the funnier because this admission of inadequacy came in the midst of an exceedingly productive and audacious streak in Cave's already storied long career.</p>
<p>But for all the manic glee he takes in fashioning a hook out of a line like ""Prolix! Prolix!/ Nothing a pair of scissors can't fix,"" the song reveals the seriousness and discipline that Cave-- the rare songwriter who keeps regular office hours-- continues to apply to his craft. In the years that have passed since <i>Lazarus</i>, Cave has both rebooted and retired Grinderman and tenured resignation papers from his longest serving Bad Seed, Mick Harvey. But given his recent track record of perseverence in the face of change, there's good reason to believe this author still has lots of explaining to do.</p></div>"|16884.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16884-reissues/|7.0|Stuart Berman

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Recorded live off the floor in Paris' historic Studio Ferber, the 17-song set is, to my ears, the Bad Seeds' most visceral, vibrant recording to date, thanks in great part to an omnipresent church choir that serves less as a vessel for spiritual uplift than a sneering critique of organized religion. (From the gate-crashing opener ""Get Ready for Love"": ""Praise Him till you forgot what you're praising Him for/ Then praise Him a little bit more."") The Bad Seeds' first recording without the corrupting influence of long-time guitar-scraper Blixa Bargeld, <i>Abattoir Blues</i> compensates for his dissonant edge with pure gospel punk muscle, while <i>Lyre of Orpheus</i> elevates Cave's balladeer guise to a grand, widescreen scale. But, in their own unique ways, both present a response to the looming threat of holy war: where <i>Abattoir</i>'s ""Hiding All Away"" sadistically champions it as cause for celebration (""There is a war coming!""), <i>Orpheus</i>' mournful closer ""Carry Me"" and ""O Children"" constitute last-ditch pleas for salvation.<span style=""mso-spacerun: yes;""> </span> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>Abattoir/Orpheus</i> was going to be a hard act to follow and, judging by the lack of outtakes on offer here, one that drew the creative well dry at the time. But instead of trying to top it, Cave wisely stripped down, hijacking fellow Bad Seeds Sclavunous, Warren Ellis, and Martyn Casey for a barrage-rock regression-therapy session as Grinderman. The satellite band further mined Cave's growing obsession with American pop culture and was enthusiastically received by old and new Cave fans alike. But its ultimate purpose may have well been to serve as a sort-of Bad Seeds boot camp. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11375-dig-lazarus-dig/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!</i></a> scraped away Grinderman's surface squall, but retained its streetwise, dick-swinging attitude (and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd85SK7dESU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">porn-star 'taches</a>). And true to its conflation of the sacred and the profane-- resurrecting the New Testament's Lazarus as a hustler in modern-day New York City-- <i>Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!</i> is at once the Bad Seeds' most classic rockin' album to date (with ""Today's Lesson"" built upon the ""Jenny says"" template of the Velvets' ""Rock &amp; Roll""), and its most sonically adventurous, as heard in the eerily disembodied krautrock of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb5g23u2zw0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Night of the Lotus Eaters""</a> (though, sadly, the bonus disc neglects to include the more menacing version the Bad Seeds used to open shows on their 2008 tour).</p>
<p>Cave turned 50 during <i>Lazarus</i>' recording, but the only hints of aging arise when he turns the pen on himself and his process: Just as the <i>Abattoir Blues</i> standout ""There She Goes, My Beautiful World"" rendered writer's block as an apocalyptic affliction, <i>Lazarus</i>' centerpiece, ""We Call Upon the Author"", keys in on the existential crisis of the 21st century scribe, who's duty-bound to educate the oblivious ""idiot constituency"" and ""myxomatoid kids"" while struggling to measure up to the greats. (""Berryman was the best! He wrote like wet papier-mâché!"") It's a hilarious song-- and all the funnier because this admission of inadequacy came in the midst of an exceedingly productive and audacious streak in Cave's already storied long career.</p>
<p>But for all the manic glee he takes in fashioning a hook out of a line like ""Prolix! Prolix!/ Nothing a pair of scissors can't fix,"" the song reveals the seriousness and discipline that Cave-- the rare songwriter who keeps regular office hours-- continues to apply to his craft. In the years that have passed since <i>Lazarus</i>, Cave has both rebooted and retired Grinderman and tenured resignation papers from his longest serving Bad Seed, Mick Harvey. But given his recent track record of perseverence in the face of change, there's good reason to believe this author still has lots of explaining to do.</p></div>"|16884.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16884-reissues/|8.4|Stuart Berman

He may be the most self-possessed artist working today, shifting and feinting and dodging to his own rhythm, his own sensibility. It may not always be apparent to outsiders or even to fans; in fact, his 20-year career is peppered with question marks and odd course changes, suggesting an aloofness that can be as fascinating as it is alienating. What is apparent, however, is that it all makes sense to him, such that even his most obscure asides carry the force of self-determination.</p>
<p>His latest headscratcher is an EP-- as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/351-bonnie-prince-billy/"" target=""_blank"">Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy</a>-- of new takes on old songs, titled <i>Now Here's My Plan</i>, presumably borrowed from this <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/147150.Now_Here_s_My_Plan"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shel Silverstein book</a>. Perhaps the book's subtitle-- ""A Book of Futilities""-- says more than the title itself: The weight of Oldham's catalog may be weighing on him, an inescapable burden that even this most mercurial artist cannot shake. Rather than crumple under so many songs, Oldham finds opportunity by redefining them, as he has done in the past. In 2004, a scant five years after introducing his Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy moniker, Oldham reassessed his back catalog on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/702-greatest-palace-music/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy Sings Greatest Palace Music</i></a>, on which he reconfigured some of his earliest material in a self-consciously C&amp;W style. Perhaps it was a sly parody of the greatest hits package that often seems obligatory once artists notch a certain number of releases. Or perhaps he was just bored.</p>
<p>If there's any sort of parodic sensibility guiding <i>Now Here's My Plan</i>, Oldham's playing it awfully close to the chest. Backed by his tour band, he circles through six old cuts ranging from 1999 through 2009, offering new arrangements and in some cases dramatically different interpretations. The band is good, road-tested, and sympathetic to Oldham's most harebrained schemes. Emmett Kelly's guitar functions like a good movie score: It sets a tone while never intruding on the action, and while it might not always foreground the songs, he's always doing something intriguing. And <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29064-angel-olsen/"" target=""_blank"">Angel Olsen</a> may be his best duet partner, with that seen-it-all break in her voice. The musicians-- including Ben Boye, Van Campbell, and Danny Kiely-- have variously appeared on recent Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy albums, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15886-wolfroy-goes-to-town/"" target=""_blank""><i>Wolfroy Goes to Town</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12859-beware/"" target=""_blank""><i>Beware</i></a>.</p>
<p>The band is so prominent on the EP that it takes on the feel of a tour souvenir, suggesting new arrangements worked out onstage. As such, despite the gravity of Oldham's lyrics and the solemnity of these performances, it sounds less weighty than their previous efforts. Few have written about the desperation that attends love and sex and companionship as evocatively as Oldham has done, so songs like ""Beast for Thee"" and ""No Gold Digger"" are welcome exhumations and strong showcases for Oldham's singing. Over the years his voice has grown a bit mushier with age, exhibiting a soft grain evocative of time and wear. He sounds more human, which lends this droning version of ""Three Questions"" in particular a directness not necessarily present in the original.</p>
<p>It's one thing to reset deep album cuts, another thing entirely to manhandle your biggest hit-- if ""hit"" can describe any Will Oldham song. ""I See a Darkness"" is most certainly his most well-known song: Not only does it anchor his best album, but it's also the one upon which Johnny Cash bestowed the status of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqodCNWqS8c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">modern country standard</a>. On the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46429-watch-the-video-for-the-new-version-of-bonnie-prince-billys-i-see-a-darkness/"" target=""_blank"">new version</a>, drummer Van Campbell quickens the pulse of the song with an insistent kickdrum tattoo, and Oldham's performance is spirited but less solemn. It's less an intimation of evil or tragedy and more like a reminder: ""Guys, I completely forgot to mention-- I see a darkness, yonder!""</p>
<p>Essentially, Oldham has taken his weightiest song and rendered it inconsequential. It's neither a piss-take nor a stunt, but it does turn a career highlight into another deep cut. His brazen attitude toward his back catalog, which would be so easy to revere, is commendable, even refreshing. Whether <i>Now Here's My Plan</i> succeeds in its obscure goal is almost beside the point. Whether you'll listen to it more than once is another matter entirely.</p></div>"|16855.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16855-now-heres-my-plan-ep/|6.8|Stephen M. Deusner

On this collection of two EPs, Hampshire-born electronic musician <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28819-seams/"" target=""_blank"">Seams</a> (real name James Welch) compiles the previously released <i>Tourist</i>, made over a Berlin summer, and <i>Sleeper</i>, a new set that emanated from Welch on his downhearted return to England. Logic should dictate which of the two would be more unhinged and experimental; logic does not apply to Berlin records.</p>
<p><i>Tourist</i> is light and charmed, full of field recordings of street instruments and celebratory chatter that you wouldn't place in the German capital if pushed to guess where they were recorded. Opener ""Hung Markets"" feels like it was captured in the busy kitchen garden of a house in the Japanese countryside, sounding impressionistic and softly sprinkled rather than hard hewn, as casual as the chime of a translucent beaded curtain in a doorway. The bass inhales rather than pounds, and the sparkle of the various textures strongly evokes <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3168-everything-ecstatic/"" target=""_blank""><i>Everything Ecstatic</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>. Captured djembe drums, bongos, and the rhythmic chop of monotone chimes chatter through the other three songs on the EP, a gentle waterslide of bedroom electronics and a krautrock heartbeat that seems to fall halfway between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1430-dominik-eulberg/"" target=""_blank"">Dominik Eulberg</a>'s quieter moments and the rush of Warm Digits' 2011 debut album. Each song beats under a hum of haze or ice that feels less like nostalgia, and more like a defense mechanism for their creator; a cloud purposefully placed between him and his desired surroundings to remind him that this bounty will pass, so don't get too attached.</p>
<p>While the general worldliness of this EP could be construed as a lack of focus, its gentle sense of wonder construes Welch's mindset at being in Berlin; eyes and ears open, transmitting his awe at his surroundings rather than trying to emulate the sounds that drew him to what's arguably the global capital of techno. Curiously, those are the sounds that manifest in the record he made in his old bedroom; if we're getting psychological about it, it's easy to see them as a projection of desire regarding where Welch would rather be spending his days.</p>
<p>The border between <i>Tourist</i> and <i>Sleeper</i> is as pronounced as the one that the former's city of origin once knew. The organic softness vanishes, in its place a muted, clipped darkness, a slippery male vocal winding back and forth in a locked cage that constitutes a torturous form of claustrophobia; being locked in, but able to see out, Tantalus-style. The titles of the other three songs here are telling: ""Potential"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13831-punch/"" target=""_blank"">""Punch""</a>, ""The Long Wait"". ""Potential"" bristles and jars before being unzipped to reveal a bed of electrified cilia, a prickly cactus tendril party that progressively gets more bodily.</p>
<p>Welch has a tendency to repeat motifs that aren't wildly exciting through the EP, but ""Punch"" eventually reaches an exhilarating upward mechanical cycle, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30051-factory-floor/"" target=""_blank"">Factory Floor</a>'s ""Lying"" repurposed as workout music, the odd phrase adorned with a glistening coating as a reward for your exertions. (The fifth time in a row I listened to it, I realized I'd been grinding my teeth for 20 minutes solid.) ""The Long Wait"" is intense in a different fashion, down to the siren-like swathe that blasts through the song's final half. It's desperate and dramatic, and works like a cliffhanger to the EP, building up all this tension only to leave it unresolved come the end. That there's the potential to extrapolate this much about James Welch's personal psychogeography from these two EPs might imply that his musical language is a tad literal at this stage, but there's more than enough potential in this compelling, absorbing collection to suggest that he'll one day cultivate the kind of mystery that's truly transporting.</p></div>"|16915.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16915-touristsleeper/|7.1|Laura Snapes

""Josephine, I don't love her anymore,"" frontman Husky Gawenda sings on ""Don't Tell Your Mother""; later, on ""Farewell (in 3 Parts)"", he sings, ""there was a lot we didn't say, wasn't there, Josephine?"" The rest of their story is told in fits and starts throughout <i>Forever So</i>; there's the three weeks spent in the motel by the sea, an unforeseen overnighter in a bus stop, the river in the woods where Gawenda washed away his sins. These vivid scenes and impressionistic details make for a surprisingly lifelike portrait of a love gone south, even as it poses as many questions as it answers. You may never quite get every last detail out of Husky, but you'll certainly get the picture.</p>
<p>Husky's music plays much like Gawenda's lyrics: spare one moment, bursting with feeling the next. Pitched somewhere between the pristine, pocket-orchestral feel of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3947-sufjan-stevens/"" target=""_blank"">Sufjan</a> and the intricate, ever-changing popcraft of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3768-the-shins/"" target=""_blank"">the Shins</a>, they're preternaturally confident for a young band, piling on when needs be but just as willing to pull back to almost nothing.</p>
<p>There are shades of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4158-paul-simon/"" target=""_blank"">Paul Simon</a> and, again, Sufjan dancing around the edges of Gawenda's high, clear voice, and his penchant for full sentences and story-songs sometimes brings to mind early Ben Gibbard. Although there's a slight storyteller's detachment to some of the less blatantly personal affairs here, when he's speaking from the heart, you'll know it. At first, <i>Forever So</i> almost seems too simplistic, just a couple of chords and some guy banging on about his ex. But once you've leaned into the record a few times and learned a little more about Josephine, what isn't said-- and, consequently, what isn't played-- becomes every bit as compelling as what is.</p>
<p><i>Forever So</i>'s resolutely overcast vibe grows a touch dreary around the three-quarter mark; Husky's tempos tend toward the deliberate, and they're most comfortable hanging out in a minor key, but after nine or 10 fairly maudlin affairs in a row, you may find yourself longing for a little respite. ""Hundred Dollar Suit"" proves a much-needed burst of energy in the back end, but it isn't quite enough to help shake the feeling that <i>Forever So</i> could've been more potent had they shaved off a few minutes of wandering. Such is heartbreak, I suppose: confusing, morose, and always running on a little longer than it should.</p>
<p>A few lines here and there miss their marks: amidst the lovelorn stuff that surrounds them, ""I just killed a man, it doesn't feel real,"" from ""How Do You Feel"", or the fuck-off he gives his boss on ""Don't Tell Your Mother"", seem strikingly out of character. But that's just it: too many breakup albums couch personal matters in universal terms, but Gawenda smartly takes the opposite route. He allows for enough specificity to make his characters and the situations he puts them in feel very real while allowing for enough ambiguity-- helped along by his story's somewhat dodgy chronology-- to allow the sneaky feelings behind them to resonate well beyond all the particulars. Only twice does the name Josephine come up throughout <i>Forever So</i>, yet hardly a moment goes by where you can't feel the loss.</p></div>"|16846.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16846-forever-so/|6.0|Paul Thompson

And it's true enough that 3MP's sound is as immediately recognizable as <i>theirs</i> in 2012 as it was in 1995: the spooked-out murmurs building to wheezing pained cries, the clean bass propelling you across the songs' emotionally blasted terrain, the down-and-out dirges alternating with swinging rhythms like some starved and serious take on 70s glam and prog-pop. But 3MP's odd-man-out status in the current indie landscape also has something to do with the fact that the original context for their music seems to have utterly disappeared. </p>
<p>So <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"" target=""_blank"">Guided By Voices</a> can return to a world where dozens of wannabe garage geniuses and lo-fi delinquents draw on the skuzzy and scatterbrained Pollard-pop aesthetic. They feel like part of a continuum, a sound that continued on in their absence. 3MP was once part of a scene too, however loosely defined and fractious, but one that pretty much no longer exists, or at least has zero cultural currency at the moment. Marrying the stately quiet-then-loud musical dynamics of what would come to be known as post-rock to the emotionally raw performing style of hardcore, ""post-hardcore"" was one of the most baldly named subgenres of all time-- and, at one point, enough of a potential commercial draw to get the resolutely grim and furrow-browed 3MP signed to a major label.</p>
<p>If they're going to be an isolated if ongoing concern, 3MP should at least be free to do follow their hermetic course without succumbing to a jones for keeping up with the Joneses. That's what makes <i>Maps</i>, a classic growing-pains-between-albums EP, so frustrating. It's precisely the sort of flawed and exploratory record you'd expect from a band stretching itself awake after a long absence, taking the opportunity to flaunt some new styles since no one was expecting their return anyway. But <i>Inevitable</i> was so strong as a whole, with even its minor departures grounded in 3MP's long-assured aesthetic, that it's odd to hear them futzing about on their <i>second</i> major post-reunion release. </p>
<p><i>Maps</i> is the most richly realized of any of their recordings so far, full of painterly little sonic details and given a warm production sheen. (Even when they rolled in the orchestral touches, the albums 3MP made in the 90s were full of spiky instruments playing out against austere backdrops, in keeping with their contemporaries.) And two of the five songs here, ""Wires"" and ""This Escape"", are classic examples of 3MP's knack for pensive gloom, which sounds even better with all that sonic attention lavished on it. On the other hand they make some regrettable choices, mostly whenever they decide to lighten up and/or pick up the pace. </p>
<p>With its big bright chorus and bouncing rhythm, ""Long Way Up"" is the closest thing 3MP have ever come to writing a ""real"" pop song, rather than melancholy mope rock that plays around with out-of-date pop forms. In places it also sounds a hell of a lot like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a>'s shoegaze-funk circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12246-dear-science/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dear Science</i></a>. Not so much that it comes off calculating, but either way, it's disarming coming from a band that's made a minor career out of sounding so inimitable, dark, and inward-looking. And while it's competent enough as indie-flavored pop tunes go, let's just say light and hopeful and groovy isn't really 3MP's forte. Better is ""Blu"", which builds not to a howl but to an angelic ooh-ooh-ooh, traditionally anthemic without totally abandoning the dark stuff for professionalized indie's current fixation on stadium-aspiring cheesiness. The only real  flop is ""Birdy"", where 3MP's interest in glam swagger gets so cleaned up and mechanized they come off like one of those goofily ""menacing"" industrial-tinged dance bands that got signed in the wake of Nine Inch Nails' success. </p>
<p>Who knows what any of these directions will mean for the next 3MP album, or if there'll even be one. Maybe <i>Maps</i>' jumble is something they had to get out of their system to return to their patented bleak-ass and arty post-hardcore epics. Or maybe they're scoring their future plans as they go, figuring out their next move before they've really worked out the kinks. It takes a lot of spine to completely absent yourself from the cultural conversation, to focus solely on your own idiosyncratic space, especially in a world as trend-driven as rock music. So while it's easy to understand 3MP's desire to branch out and meet modern indie halfway, it was a lot easier to admire them when they came back doing the same damn thing they've always done, and doing it well.</p></div>"|16875.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16875-maps-ep/|5.0|Jess Harvell

It runs nearly eight minutes. ""I've been thinking all day about the moon,"" Antony begins. ""Like, is it an accident that women menstruate once a month and that the moon comes once a month? ...And then what about the fact that we're made of 70% water?"" It goes on like this, referencing ""patriarchal monotheism,"" the matter-of-fact revelation that he's a witch who ""de-baptized"" himself,"" and ruminations on ""the feminization of deities."" Behold: Antony stage banter.</p>
<p>Antony's exquisitely earnest ""Antony-ness,"" though, is the rare gift he brings to the world, and in whatever form he chooses to dispense it, it's a joy to soak it in. Running through Antony's gently daft speech are all the elemental themes of his music-- oceans, dying leaves, blood from wombs-- and he delivers it in such a chatty, affectionate, teasing tone that by the end, you are not only disarmed, but lit by a small glow of wonder. And then, of course, he resumes playing and singing.</p>
<p>For a sizable contingent of music listeners, Antony's music is like emotional tincture; powerful, necessary, sometimes a bit too intense taken undiluted. And certainly not for daily consumption. I am one of those listeners: Some innate measuring stick that calculated my desired intake of abject suffering balked at the need for another Antony record after his crossover album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/467-i-am-a-bird-now/"" target=""_blank"">I Am a Bird Now</a></i>. That record still sits at the center of my listening life, but to add to it, for me, seemed only to chip away from its power, with the result that I found myself appreciating Antony from a distance, and feeling generally grateful for his existence, more than engaging with his music.</p>
<p>If you are one of these listeners, perhaps you will appreciate <i>Cut the World</i> like I did. As a compact reminder of the overwhelming force carried by Antony's best music. The song selection here draws smartly from all of his studio albums, touching on his self-titled and culling the most potent material from of <i>The Crying Light</i> and <i>Swanlights</i>. Antony is accompanied by the Danish National Chamber Orchestra, performing arrangements by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6442-nico-muhly/"" target=""_blank"">Nico Muhly</a>, Rob Moose, and Antony himself.</p>
<p>If ever an artist's catalogue has demanded orchestral accompaniment, it is Antony's. The emotional surge in his music all but demands the blooming of a string section. His voice dismantles defenses, pours over boundaries, and this quality is mirrored so powerfully in the arrangements that the originals seem incomplete in retrospect. He has performed in front of a full orchestra often over the years, but <i>Cut the World</i> is the first sustained glimpse those of us outside the hall have gotten of the results. ""You Are My Sister""'s opening piano figure carries twice the drama brought into pungent, mournful woodwinds. ""Cripple and the Starfish"" swells magnificently to twice its size in this setting: It feels Mahlerian, overwhelming. The DNCO plays with a simple radiance, as if they've always been a part of this music.</p>
<p>The only song that feels diminished is ""Another World""; a low drone tugs at track's harmonic center, muddying its elemental, prayer-like surface. But otherwise, this is a revelatory way to experience Antony's music. The inward-curling pain dissolves, leaving only the aching generosity. The title track, the lone new song, starts with a soft rustle of harmonics akin to those of Arvo Pärt. When the full orchestra enters on the chorus, the bloom of warmth is physically gratifying. Antony's music is like that-- restorative, good to be near. Like the sun, it's something we all need in our lives, even if it feels good to get out of it once in a while.</p></div>"|16902.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16902-cut-the-world/|8.1|Jayson Greene

His failures and triumphs as Wavves certainly haven't been private, he makes no attempt to hide what kind of music he aspires to make, and he writes songs about marijuana, feeling like shit, surfing, his girlfriend, and wanting to meet Dave Grohl. The exact same things he talks about in interviews. This all works in favor of <i>Stay Calm</i>, a 22-minute beat tape he made with his brother Joel ""Kynan"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47252-wavves-nathan-williams-and-his-brother-talk-instrumental-beat-project-sweet-valley/"" target=""_blank"">under the name Sweet Valley</a>, because it does away with any questions about intent and sincerity and makes you take it at face value. And everything from its cartoon-porn cover to its <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkeJmgDtRTM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>California Games</i></a> song titles to the 80s baby name of the group only serves to underline what the music eventually reveals: this is exactly what you'd expect out of a 22-minute beat tape from Wavves and his brother; act accordingly.</p>
<p>Because the idea of a young punk-pop artist making beats on the side isn't interesting in and of itself. It's probably harder to find ones who <i>aren't</i> interested in hip-hop production and considering you can catch, for example, Trash Talk and SpaceGhostPurrp regularly sharing bills like it's nothing, it's obvious there's more crossover between the punk and rap worlds than fashion and skateboard tricks. But ultimately, the Williams brothers appear less interested in taking chances and establishing their own voice in this field than flipping the Spicoli persona of Wavves and presenting themselves as eager students. Though it does so rather adroitly, each track ultimately distinguishes itself as the one that acknowledges some unspoken assignment and does ""that thing."" <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/foolsgoldrecs/sweet-valley-total-carnage"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Total Carnage""</a> is the one that chops up soul samples and puts it over squealing synth leads. The wobbly ""Suzuka 9 Hours"" makes a day out of field trips to the Brainfeeder and Stones Throw headquarters. There's those G-funk references on ""Dunk Dreams 95"". All in all, it's something like Javelin without the curatorial bent.</p>
<p><i>Stay Calm </i>does maintain a center throughout, mostly working in post-chillwave beatmaking microtrends while retaining the sunburnt, major-key vibe of Wavves' breakthrough summer of 2009. Even with its lurch and clicking hi-hats, the ska guitar stabs on ""Sidewalk Surfer"" suggest that any talk of ""footwork"" in regards to Sweet Valley should be discussing that of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5qsEM9s8OY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ben Carr</a> rather than anything out of Chicago. The wailing vocal samples on ""Eight"" indeed sound haunted, but they're more tweaked to sound like friendly ghosts than witch-house. All in all, it's sunny, it's stoned, and its brief periods of hyperactivity are counterbalanced by long stretches of summer sedation. In other words, it'd be perfect musical accompaniment for a brief skateboarding video, but that just reminds me of an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12993-time-soundtrack/"">actual skateboarding video soundtrack made by Odd Nosdam</a> a while back that did most of this stuff with more finesse and range. I was really into it for a couple of weeks and then forgot it as quickly.</p>
<p>Which speaks to an unavoidable shortcoming of <i>Stay Calm</i>, that it's distinguished more by its possibilities for integration than its actual content. As far as texture, sample flipping, and diversity, these don't do anything above the call of duty-- but let's be real, the potential for synergy means that there's a chance Freddie Gibbs or Danny Brown might actually rap over it. Likewise, it's hard not to wonder if some of these ideas would be better served as future Wavves songs, since <i>Stay Calm </i>is not all that far off from sample-based material like ""Mickey Mouse"" and ""Baseball Cards"" from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14415-king-of-the-beach/"" target=""_blank""><i>King of the Beach</i></a>. Those weren't the singles, but they nonetheless served as the best argument for Williams' musicality and staying power. If the whole point was to put the word out that the Williams brothers make beats, keep Nathan's name hot while we await the upcoming Wavves record, and boost the profile of Joel, then <i>Stay Calm </i>is unquestionably a success on account of it doing nothing to <i>damage</i> either party. It justifies its appearance as a flicker on your Twitter feed, but as 22 minutes of our finite time on planet Earth that could be used to call your mother or finally finish that grad school application... Whatever you decide, I think you knew the answer all along.</p></div>"|17000.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17000-stay-calm/|6.1|Ian Cohen

Calvin Butts speech. It could be a trick of reverse psychology; in contrast to Thug's extraordinarily distinctive style, it seems more a knowing joke, or if he's feeling ambitious, an attempt to epitomize and subvert an archetype. His rap style, too, has this kind of fearlessness; he is obviously and unapologetically a descendent of Lil Wayne at the peak of his experimental phase, where Wayne pushed against the boundaries of a rapper's technical control. At his best, Young Thug embraces that style, but rather than making it a logical endpoint of an artist on the ascent, he uses it as the baseline. It is a given on any Young Thug track that he will be croaking, half-singing, breaking against graphite-on-paper predictability of traditional rap, and performing with such confidence that calling him the product of his influences feels shortsighted.</p>
<p>His latest mixtape, <i>I Came from Nothing 3</i>, is a dense, ambitious attempt to cultivate an entirely new rap style. It is also frequently frustrating, shifting from eye-openingly original to inconsequential from track to track. Unlike Lil B, to whom he might be immediately compared, Young Thug holds onto some traditional frameworks that could give him more of a potential foothold to transcend a cult fanbase. He still makes inventive pop songs. He sticks to a familiar dope boy mystique. And although Lil Wayne is his obvious forefather, he also springs from a less discussed but incredibly influential style of Atlanta-based hip-hop. The creative stew of Atlanta's melodic underground, where Auto-Tune didn't just avert death but spawned new life, perhaps via the influence of ecstasy and the dominance of strip club culture. Artists both well known (Future) and less-known (Kwony Cash) evolved a style that has often seemed less persona-driven and more about songcraft. This is the milieu whence comes Young Thug, who collaborated early with the Rich Kidz (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AsTOX8nZWw%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""100 Dollar Autograph""</a>) and Cash Out, currently with one of the year's biggest rap songs and a regular Young Thug collaborator (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sosAMnL8fc4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Got It""</a>).</p>
<p>What Young Thug brings to the table, then, isn't just a weird, experimental approach to rapping, but presence, persona, mystique, and, potentially, star power. These are often things frowned upon by ""serious"" music fans, imagining themselves as discerning listeners who see through those theatrics, but in rap, where music is so heavily persona-driven, it gives an artist dimension. Of course, the other, most important factor for becoming a star is crafting hits, and when he wants to, even while pushing against conservative ideas of good taste, Young Thug can deliver. <i>I Came from Nothing 3</i> is less interested in these songs, though, relative to the last tape (see: ""Keep in Touch"", ""Curtains"".) Instead, it indulges, heavily, in the bright, brittle synthesizers and continually cheery enthusiasm that often overwhelms.</p>
<p>The exception is ""Foreign"", a song with a hypnotic marimba loop and an incredibly memorable hook, a track that should make fantasy summer jam playlists across the country. It also manages to transcend Young Thug's cult status most effectively. Most of the LP seems to push deep into its own universe, to the detriment of those not already convinced of Young Thug's vision, but rewarding those already sold. Tracks like ""Admit It"" and ""I Know Ya"" epitomize the kind of enthusiastic euphoria that is the currency of this strain of the Atlanta underground. Songs like ""Angry Sex"" offer a refreshing twist, giving its subject a kind of jubilant triviality.</p></div>"|16953.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16953-i-came-from-nothing-3/|6.9|David Drake

Not that it can't be addressed, but that it's so constant and ongoing, a reflection in process as much as, or even more so, than product.<i> Copenhagen Dreams</i> is on the one hand ""just"" another album from the Icelandic-born, Copenhagen-based musician, again assisted in part by a series of regular musical collaborators and performers, with an emphasis on the gently experimental and beautifully mood-setting. It is also another in the series of film soundtracks that have made up a vast swathe of his artwork, even beyond his standalone albums over the past decade. <i>Copenhagen Dreams </i>is not out to surprise, but to reaffirm and extend a body of work and a considerable reputation.</p>
<p>But leaving it at that is both unduly and unnecessarily bloodless. The film in question, originally released a couple of years ago by director Max Kestner, is the kind of documentary that a hundred years of motion pictures, television, and more has made into a kind of subtle genre, the documentary study of a city that relies on impression, editing, and visual and sonic sense presented to a viewer. From the multiple soundtracks created over time for Dziga Vertov's groundbreaking Russian study <i>Man With a Movie Camera</i> forward, the idea of crafting music for such a study is equally strong, whether to capture a hustle-bustle, a quiet contemplation, or a range in between. That <i>Copenhagen Dreams</i> tends toward the latter isn't a surprise given Jóhannsson's work; it's the pleasure in hearing what he does that is the key to listening.</p>
<p>The choice of subject for the documentary does allow for more interpretive space than might be guessed. For nearly anyone who is not Danish or living in or near the country, it's arguably something near to a blank slate beyond name and location, its comparatively recent history, from Lord Nelson and Kierkegaard to Hans Christian Andersen and the Christiania district, at most the scope of trivia questions and random Wikipedia trawls. Musically the area may be most famous for the well established Roskilde Festival as much as anything else. Since Copenhagen is not Moscow or any similar large capital city that has colonized the imagination of millions, it allows Kestner to focus on the city as it is as opposed to what it must be or live up to. </p>
<p>As such the soundtrack to <i>Copenhagen Dreams</i> functions predominantly in its own right as impressionistic and not necessarily cohesive, a series of quick sketches that impress on the mind only in quick bursts. Yet for all the activity the film shows or implies, there's a general unity that essentially <i>is</i> Jóhannsson as he has established himself, simultaneously classically-tried and placed in a 21st-century context with the technological possibilities provided. Straightforward piano-only songs such as ""She Loves to Ride the Port Ferry When It Rains"" intertwine with thicker arrangements and unsettled elements, perhaps its own reflection of a centuries-old city looking into an unknowable future.</p>
<p>""Eleven Thousand Six Hundred and Sixty-Nine Died of Natural Causes"" is the name of the first track, a minute-long piece that starts with piano on its own before backward masking layers over the second half, a repetition of a simple melodic figure throughout. The melody recurs in ""The Song About the Hyacinths"", one of several moments in the album where themes play out once more; in this case, Jóhannsson adds quickly plucked strings to not only distinguish the piece but to provide a crackling energy that further echoes elsewhere in the album.</p>
<p>Thus, the skittering glitch of ""The Jewish Cemetery on Møllegade"" floats above a subtle loop of keyboards before strings slowly move almost like a series of great sighs, distant tones adding to a feeling of alien activity, perhaps even a restlessness that belies the title's implication-- or suggests deeper feelings at work, especially notable in a country that was largely successful in saving its Jewish population from the depredations of Nazism. Similarly nervous-sounding tracks like ""There's No Harm Done"" contrast with moments of pure elegiac impact, such as the matching of piano and chimes on ""Here, They Used to Build Ships"", a suggestion of something magical but irrevocably departed. If the apparent formula is clear, the results still resonate, and when the strings appear towards the end, the result is a sudden crushing emotion, as if something else further were lost.</p>
<p>Those longer pieces that appear by default linger a bit more in the memory, but also tend to move beyond one core element, a chance for Jóhannsson to stretch out within the confines of the film's requirements. ""A Memorial Garden on Enghavevej"" lets its central piano melody flow between relentless minimalism and a music-box prettiness, concluding with what could almost feel like sparkles, while the last piece ""They Imagine the City Growing Out Into the Ocean"", one of several tracks featuring múm's Hildur Guðnadóttir on vocals, has both a quality of benediction in its slow string beauty and a suggestion of a future, however melancholic. If that is to be considered ""typically"" Jóhannsson at this point, it is no less powerful, or enjoyable, for that reason.</p></div>"|16960.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16960-copenhagen-dreams/|7.5|Ned Raggett

It's a good thing they did: In a year crowded with psych-rock reboots and garage rock re-thinks, the band's <a href=""http://apachedropout.bandcamp.com/album/apache-dropout"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2011 self-titled debut</a> stuck out.</p>
<p>Rather than favoring the minimalism of 1980s UK groups like Spacemen 3 and Loop (long the go-to influences for stoney lo-fi basement bands) or a relentless Stooges-style chug, Apache Dropout drove the wayback machine even further into the past, choosing to emphasize the shuffling, swinging rhythms of old weird rock'n'roll. Songs like ""Sam Phillips Rising"" dialed in the necessary amount of pummeling repetition and echo-drenched vocals, but broke the monotony using rhythmic cues swiped from country western 45s, bubblegum pop jingles, and goofball R&amp;B. In its most sublime moments (See <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIcuBed9YVY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""God Bless You Johan Kugelberg""</a>), Apache Dropout came over like a heavier, foggier take on the Cramps. </p>
<p>Aside from a modest increase in fidelity, <i>Bubblegum</i><i> Graveyard</i>, the trio's second LP, doesn't tamper with the formula too much. Their thematic focus has drifted away from 60s mind-expansion pulp and toward vintage horror comic book imagery. The lead track, ""Archie's Army"" sets the tone, with singer and guitarist Sonny Alexander yowling about a deep, dark, bubblegum graveyard populated with undead Jugheads.</p>
<p>Apache Dropout don't try to imbue their drug rock with spiritual heft, tragedy, or greater meaning. The lyrics set a scene-- a surreal suburban teenage stoner-void that the Dead Milkmen could probably appreciate-- but any shreds of literal meaning are second to the delivery, the fever-pitched cosmic yelping that's intended to cultivate a freak-out appropriate environment at concerts. On that front, Alexander's a pro. He grunts and growls and bleats with the deranged power of a pre-meltdown Roky Erickson, bringing a kind of mad scientist desperation to the group's cover of the 1910 Fruitgum Company's otherwise benign nugget, ""1-2-3 Red Light"".</p>
<p>It's only when Apache Dropout indulge their pulpier interests too faithfully that they run into trouble. ""With fingers dark and eyes that glow, the shrieking in the woods cannot be good,"" sings Alexander on ""Ghost Stories"", plying standard-issue campfire creepiness over jangling guitars."" And ""Robbin' the Bank"" is a little too unimaginative in its appropriation of old-school country bad-guy-hero balladry. These aren't bad songs, but when compared to <i>Bubblegum</i> <i>Graveyard</i>'s stellar, weirder moments, they're a bit of a let down. When Apache Dropout manage to get fully swept up their own wacko energy-- like on ""I-80"" or ""Carryin' Fleas""-- or when they just focus their thoughts on the weirdness of ther Midwestern stomping grounds, though, they carve out an intimidating spot in a crowded scene.</p></div>"|16893.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16893-bubblegum-graveyard/|6.7|Aaron Leitko

""It was pretty random,"" co-founder Nick Zammuto told Pitchfork in an interview in 2003. ""I met this girl Julie up in Williamstown, and we were both working the field of art conservation. She ended up getting a job with the Guggenheim and I followed her down to New York where she got this apartment with her sister. Her sister was friends with Paul [de Jong, cellist and co-founder], and so we ended up living in the same building together. I remember the first time I went over to his apartment. He pulled out this Shooby Taylor record.""</p>
<p>Taylor was a musical oddity known for his energetic, one-of-a-kind scat singing. He was profiled in Irwin Chusid's <i>Songs in the Key of Z: The Curious Universe of Outsider Music</i>. And the fact that his music was in the room when Zammuto first met cellist and fellow sound collector Paul de Jong makes perfect sense. Taylor's music was something that was lost, found, re-discovered, and shared. It was weird and it had an uncertain context and the people who passed those records around created new ones. Such odd gems are rescued from obscurity and passed around by people like de Jong and Zammuto. And that drive provided the initial inspiration for the Books.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of the last decade, and now the Books are no more. After four albums, an EP, stray tracks, and some videos, the Books called it quits this year. Nick Zammuto was somewhat evasive as to why, but it doesn't really matter. It feels right for the Books to wind things up. They had a brilliant idea, they created a sound around it, they bent and shaped and explored that sound as best they could. And then eventually it came time to put that sound away. You couldn't ask for a better send-off than <i>A Dot in Time</i>, a lovingly compiled and gorgeous box set that collects all of their released music on vinyl and mp3 along with a DVD of their videos.</p>
<p>The Books had a distinctive sound that was like nothing else when it arrived on the scene in 2002. It sounded so bizarre and alluring in part because it was the perfect music for a very specific time and place. If it'd have arrived five years later, it wouldn't have made nearly as much sense. In 2002, Google was firmly in control of the web search game, but information in general still seemed overwhelming, random, unknowable. There were fewer ways to focus attention on a single nugget of culture. And the Books were founded in part as a way to take a stream of artifacts and re-assemble them into something new. Which is another way of saying that the Books made less sense in the post-YouTube world; once everyone became an archivist and the fragments of culture were available to all, someone coming to the Books for the first time did so without the same sense of wonder.</p>
<p>But all that was a few years away. First, we had <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/854-thought-for-food/"" target=""_blank""><i>Thought for Food</i></a>, one of the most startling and original debut albums of the 00s. With this project, you didn't know where one element started and another began. What was sampled? What was played? Where did these sounds come from? Was the young child being told, ""You have no mother and father,"" and being asked not to touch his father in the song ""Motherless Bastard"" ""real"" or was this from a movie or was it staged? It was hard to know, and this lingering sense of strangeness and unknowability suited the music perfectly. Without access to the details of authorship, you could only let the sound wash over you, and it was a beauty. Subtle guitar and banjo, bits of cello, some voices. We were just coming out of the peak era of Chicago post-rock, and the Books' approach to sound bore some relationship to the thoughtful, understated, cerebral, but still deeply felt expression of Jim O'Rourke, one of the lynchpins of that scene. A decade on, <i>Thought for Food</i> still works its peculiar magic.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/855-the-lemon-of-pink/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Lemon of Pink</i></a> is that odd follow-up album that finds a band refining and honing its sound but losing the element of surprise. The technique is almost identical, but Zammuto and de Jong had a better understanding of how to wield their instruments and samples for maximum impact. As is sometimes the case, for the Books, each of their first three albums has an almost equal number of fans who think it's the best. And in these cases, a lot depends on which you heard first. <i>The Lemon of Pink</i> showed them growing slowly into the more song-oriented direction they would develop later, but the samples are as fresh as ever, words and syllables plucked from who-knows-where and allowed to settle in your brain and grow into a new kind of meaning.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/856-lost-and-safe/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lost and Safe</i></a> was the breakthrough, the album that moved the Books out of the realm of small cult act. They'd become an enjoyable live band, and they found a sort of community in the world of bookish coffee shops and NPR. Many fans like <i>Lost and Safe</i> best, and in retrospect I feel I underrated it upon its initial release. It was one of those cases in which what I wanted from the band was different from what they were interested in doing. The Books were heading further in the direction of proper songs. Since Zammuto's voice is limited, his muted sing-speak-whisper integrated very well into the clips from instructional records and ancient news broadcasts. Coming as it did after the 2004 presidential elections, a difficult time for progressives in the United States, <i>Lost and Safe</i> had a political undercurrent that further bound the Books to this community. ""I can feel a collective rumbling in America,"" went a line in ""Be Good to Them Always"", the album highlight and arguably the greatest single track the Books ever made. It's a song that contained so much: surface beauty, intricate construction, subtle commentary. And if the album as a whole didn't quite deliver on that promise, it was the third winner in a row from a group that didn't necessarily seem like they could sustain things that long.</p>
<p>Between <i>Lost and Safe</i> and their final album, 2010's <i>The Way Out</i>, the books released a collection of scraps called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/857-music-for-a-french-elevator/"" target=""_blank""><i>Music for a French Elevator</i></a>. That EP has been greatly expanded with 32 additional tracks, and the set as a whole is unexpectedly satisfying and offers a different angle on the Books' world. Without the careful editing and thematic unity of their albums, <i>French Elevator</i> mostly shows how <i>musical</i> they were, and how adept they were at making simple guitar and cello patterns pack an emotional punch. Some of these extra tracks are just instrumentals played by Zammuto and de Jong and some are just samples, but they do illustrate the consistency of their aesthetic, how they were able to shape different textures so that they fit with with their overriding sound.</p>
<p>And then came <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14459-the-way-out/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Way Out</i></a>, a more playful and free-wheeling album. In retrospect, <i>The Way Out</i> is easily the least satisfying of the four, though it still has its charms. Experimenting with steadier beats and grooves while going heavier on the jokes, <i>The Way Out</i> ultimately feels like a dry run for Zammuto's solo work than a wrap-up to the Books proper. But heard here, in the context of their career as a whole, it's as good an epitaph as any. Something feels right about this box set, from the beautiful design to the fact that it feels a bit like a tombstone. As markers of the dead go, it's a beautiful one. May it live and decay and be covered with weeds and, eventually, be unearthed and dusted off by some young creative person still finding their way. And may that person pass it on to someone else and find a way to share something new with the world.</p></div>"|17003.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17003-a-dot-in-time/|8.4|Mark Richardson

Nick Zammuto was somewhat evasive as to why, but it doesn't really matter. It feels right for the Books to wind things up. They had a brilliant idea, they created a sound around it, they bent and shaped and explored that sound as best they could. And then eventually it came time to put that sound away. You couldn't ask for a better send-off than <i>A Dot in Time</i>, a lovingly compiled and gorgeous box set that collects all of their released music on vinyl and mp3 along with a DVD of their videos.</p>
<p>The Books had a distinctive sound that was like nothing else when it arrived on the scene in 2002. It sounded so bizarre and alluring in part because it was the perfect music for a very specific time and place. If it'd have arrived five years later, it wouldn't have made nearly as much sense. In 2002, Google was firmly in control of the web search game, but information in general still seemed overwhelming, random, unknowable. There were fewer ways to focus attention on a single nugget of culture. And the Books were founded in part as a way to take a stream of artifacts and re-assemble them into something new. Which is another way of saying that the Books made less sense in the post-YouTube world; once everyone became an archivist and the fragments of culture were available to all, someone coming to the Books for the first time did so without the same sense of wonder.</p>
<p>But all that was a few years away. First, we had <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/854-thought-for-food/"" target=""_blank""><i>Thought for Food</i></a>, one of the most startling and original debut albums of the 00s. With this project, you didn't know where one element started and another began. What was sampled? What was played? Where did these sounds come from? Was the young child being told, ""You have no mother and father,"" and being asked not to touch his father in the song ""Motherless Bastard"" ""real"" or was this from a movie or was it staged? It was hard to know, and this lingering sense of strangeness and unknowability suited the music perfectly. Without access to the details of authorship, you could only let the sound wash over you, and it was a beauty. Subtle guitar and banjo, bits of cello, some voices. We were just coming out of the peak era of Chicago post-rock, and the Books' approach to sound bore some relationship to the thoughtful, understated, cerebral, but still deeply felt expression of Jim O'Rourke, one of the lynchpins of that scene. A decade on, <i>Thought for Food</i> still works its peculiar magic.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/855-the-lemon-of-pink/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Lemon of Pink</i></a> is that odd follow-up album that finds a band refining and honing its sound but losing the element of surprise. The technique is almost identical, but Zammuto and de Jong had a better understanding of how to wield their instruments and samples for maximum impact. As is sometimes the case, for the Books, each of their first three albums has an almost equal number of fans who think it's the best. And in these cases, a lot depends on which you heard first. <i>The Lemon of Pink</i> showed them growing slowly into the more song-oriented direction they would develop later, but the samples are as fresh as ever, words and syllables plucked from who-knows-where and allowed to settle in your brain and grow into a new kind of meaning.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/856-lost-and-safe/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lost and Safe</i></a> was the breakthrough, the album that moved the Books out of the realm of small cult act. They'd become an enjoyable live band, and they found a sort of community in the world of bookish coffee shops and NPR. Many fans like <i>Lost and Safe</i> best, and in retrospect I feel I underrated it upon its initial release. It was one of those cases in which what I wanted from the band was different from what they were interested in doing. The Books were heading further in the direction of proper songs. Since Zammuto's voice is limited, his muted sing-speak-whisper integrated very well into the clips from instructional records and ancient news broadcasts. Coming as it did after the 2004 presidential elections, a difficult time for progressives in the United States, <i>Lost and Safe</i> had a political undercurrent that further bound the Books to this community. ""I can feel a collective rumbling in America,"" went a line in ""Be Good to Them Always"", the album highlight and arguably the greatest single track the Books ever made. It's a song that contained so much: surface beauty, intricate construction, subtle commentary. And if the album as a whole didn't quite deliver on that promise, it was the third winner in a row from a group that didn't necessarily seem like they could sustain things that long.</p>
<p>Between <i>Lost and Safe</i> and their final album, 2010's <i>The Way Out</i>, the books released a collection of scraps called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/857-music-for-a-french-elevator/"" target=""_blank""><i>Music for a French Elevator</i></a>. That EP has been greatly expanded with 32 additional tracks, and the set as a whole is unexpectedly satisfying and offers a different angle on the Books' world. Without the careful editing and thematic unity of their albums, <i>French Elevator</i> mostly shows how <i>musical</i> they were, and how adept they were at making simple guitar and cello patterns pack an emotional punch. Some of these extra tracks are just instrumentals played by Zammuto and de Jong and some are just samples, but they do illustrate the consistency of their aesthetic, how they were able to shape different textures so that they fit with with their overriding sound.</p>
<p>And then came <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14459-the-way-out/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Way Out</i></a>, a more playful and free-wheeling album. In retrospect, <i>The Way Out</i> is easily the least satisfying of the four, though it still has its charms. Experimenting with steadier beats and grooves while going heavier on the jokes, <i>The Way Out</i> ultimately feels like a dry run for Zammuto's solo work than a wrap-up to the Books proper. But heard here, in the context of their career as a whole, it's as good an epitaph as any. Something feels right about this box set, from the beautiful design to the fact that it feels a bit like a tombstone. As markers of the dead go, it's a beautiful one. May it live and decay and be covered with weeds and, eventually, be unearthed and dusted off by some young creative person still finding their way. And may that person pass it on to someone else and find a way to share something new with the world.</p></div>"|17003.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17003-a-dot-in-time/|9.0|Mark Richardson

And the fact that his music was in the room when Zammuto first met cellist and fellow sound collector Paul de Jong makes perfect sense.

Some of these extra tracks are just instrumentals played by Zammuto and de Jong and some are just samples, but they do illustrate the consistency of their aesthetic, how they were able to shape different textures so that they fit with with their overriding sound.</p>
<p>And then came <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14459-the-way-out/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Way Out</i></a>, a more playful and free-wheeling album. In retrospect, <i>The Way Out</i> is easily the least satisfying of the four, though it still has its charms. Experimenting with steadier beats and grooves while going heavier on the jokes, <i>The Way Out</i> ultimately feels like a dry run for Zammuto's solo work than a wrap-up to the Books proper. But heard here, in the context of their career as a whole, it's as good an epitaph as any. Something feels right about this box set, from the beautiful design to the fact that it feels a bit like a tombstone. As markers of the dead go, it's a beautiful one. May it live and decay and be covered with weeds and, eventually, be unearthed and dusted off by some young creative person still finding their way. And may that person pass it on to someone else and find a way to share something new with the world.</p></div>"|17003.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17003-a-dot-in-time/|7.2|Mark Richardson

""It was pretty random,"" co-founder Nick Zammuto told Pitchfork in an interview in 2003. ""I met this girl Julie up in Williamstown, and we were both working the field of art conservation. She ended up getting a job with the Guggenheim and I followed her down to New York where she got this apartment with her sister. Her sister was friends with Paul [de Jong, cellist and co-founder], and so we ended up living in the same building together. I remember the first time I went over to his apartment. He pulled out this Shooby Taylor record.""</p>
<p>Taylor was a musical oddity known for his energetic, one-of-a-kind scat singing. He was profiled in Irwin Chusid's <i>Songs in the Key of Z: The Curious Universe of Outsider Music</i>. And the fact that his music was in the room when Zammuto first met cellist and fellow sound collector Paul de Jong makes perfect sense. Taylor's music was something that was lost, found, re-discovered, and shared. It was weird and it had an uncertain context and the people who passed those records around created new ones. Such odd gems are rescued from obscurity and passed around by people like de Jong and Zammuto. And that drive provided the initial inspiration for the Books.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of the last decade, and now the Books are no more. After four albums, an EP, stray tracks, and some videos, the Books called it quits this year. Nick Zammuto was somewhat evasive as to why, but it doesn't really matter. It feels right for the Books to wind things up. They had a brilliant idea, they created a sound around it, they bent and shaped and explored that sound as best they could. And then eventually it came time to put that sound away. You couldn't ask for a better send-off than <i>A Dot in Time</i>, a lovingly compiled and gorgeous box set that collects all of their released music on vinyl and mp3 along with a DVD of their videos.</p>
<p>The Books had a distinctive sound that was like nothing else when it arrived on the scene in 2002. It sounded so bizarre and alluring in part because it was the perfect music for a very specific time and place. If it'd have arrived five years later, it wouldn't have made nearly as much sense. In 2002, Google was firmly in control of the web search game, but information in general still seemed overwhelming, random, unknowable. There were fewer ways to focus attention on a single nugget of culture. And the Books were founded in part as a way to take a stream of artifacts and re-assemble them into something new. Which is another way of saying that the Books made less sense in the post-YouTube world; once everyone became an archivist and the fragments of culture were available to all, someone coming to the Books for the first time did so without the same sense of wonder.</p>
<p>But all that was a few years away. First, we had <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/854-thought-for-food/"" target=""_blank""><i>Thought for Food</i></a>, one of the most startling and original debut albums of the 00s. With this project, you didn't know where one element started and another began. What was sampled? What was played? Where did these sounds come from? Was the young child being told, ""You have no mother and father,"" and being asked not to touch his father in the song ""Motherless Bastard"" ""real"" or was this from a movie or was it staged? It was hard to know, and this lingering sense of strangeness and unknowability suited the music perfectly. Without access to the details of authorship, you could only let the sound wash over you, and it was a beauty. Subtle guitar and banjo, bits of cello, some voices. We were just coming out of the peak era of Chicago post-rock, and the Books' approach to sound bore some relationship to the thoughtful, understated, cerebral, but still deeply felt expression of Jim O'Rourke, one of the lynchpins of that scene. A decade on, <i>Thought for Food</i> still works its peculiar magic.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/855-the-lemon-of-pink/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Lemon of Pink</i></a> is that odd follow-up album that finds a band refining and honing its sound but losing the element of surprise. The technique is almost identical, but Zammuto and de Jong had a better understanding of how to wield their instruments and samples for maximum impact. As is sometimes the case, for the Books, each of their first three albums has an almost equal number of fans who think it's the best. And in these cases, a lot depends on which you heard first. <i>The Lemon of Pink</i> showed them growing slowly into the more song-oriented direction they would develop later, but the samples are as fresh as ever, words and syllables plucked from who-knows-where and allowed to settle in your brain and grow into a new kind of meaning.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/856-lost-and-safe/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lost and Safe</i></a> was the breakthrough, the album that moved the Books out of the realm of small cult act. They'd become an enjoyable live band, and they found a sort of community in the world of bookish coffee shops and NPR. Many fans like <i>Lost and Safe</i> best, and in retrospect I feel I underrated it upon its initial release. It was one of those cases in which what I wanted from the band was different from what they were interested in doing. The Books were heading further in the direction of proper songs. Since Zammuto's voice is limited, his muted sing-speak-whisper integrated very well into the clips from instructional records and ancient news broadcasts. Coming as it did after the 2004 presidential elections, a difficult time for progressives in the United States, <i>Lost and Safe</i> had a political undercurrent that further bound the Books to this community. ""I can feel a collective rumbling in America,"" went a line in ""Be Good to Them Always"", the album highlight and arguably the greatest single track the Books ever made. It's a song that contained so much: surface beauty, intricate construction, subtle commentary. And if the album as a whole didn't quite deliver on that promise, it was the third winner in a row from a group that didn't necessarily seem like they could sustain things that long.</p>
<p>Between <i>Lost and Safe</i> and their final album, 2010's <i>The Way Out</i>, the books released a collection of scraps called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/857-music-for-a-french-elevator/"" target=""_blank""><i>Music for a French Elevator</i></a>. That EP has been greatly expanded with 32 additional tracks, and the set as a whole is unexpectedly satisfying and offers a different angle on the Books' world. Without the careful editing and thematic unity of their albums, <i>French Elevator</i> mostly shows how <i>musical</i> they were, and how adept they were at making simple guitar and cello patterns pack an emotional punch. Some of these extra tracks are just instrumentals played by Zammuto and de Jong and some are just samples, but they do illustrate the consistency of their aesthetic, how they were able to shape different textures so that they fit with with their overriding sound.</p>

It makes sense that he turned to his fellow countryman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"">Christian Fennesz</a> to fill out the soundtrack. Fennesz has, after all, spent a large part of his career retreating from reality through a variety of musical forms. The idea of operating in a purely sensual realm is the logical endgame he's always striving toward, whether it's in the crisp, glitch-heavy haze of his acclaimed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9760-endless-summer/""><i>Endless Summer</i></a> or via more meditative work such as his 2007 collaboration with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3683-ryuichi-sakamoto/"">Ryuichi Sakamoto</a> on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10236-cendre/""><i>Cendre</i></a>. The soundtrack to <i>AUN</i> is a natural extension of the latter, mainly because they're both positioned in a surfeit of space that gently collapses into subtle abstraction. To firm up the link, Fennesz includes three tracks from <i>Cendre</i> here, turning this into a companion piece that lightly circles around a similar domain to the one he fashioned with Sakamoto.</p>
<p>Honetschläger's film tackles a number of big themes-- humankind's relationship to nature, the inexorable (and, at times, unwelcome) march of progress, and the sense of dread at our inevitable demise. Fennesz's music is appropriately pitched somewhere between a number of emotions commonly stirred up by such subject matter. <i>AUN</i> principally drifts between fear, sadness, and loathing, often gathering its greatest force when it bridges all three of those feelings. At other times emotions are compartmentalized, with Fennesz locking them up in little boxes tailored for specific scenes in the film. On ""Sekai"", for example, Fennesz simply does sadness, coating his guitar in a great glut of echo and pinning it down to a slow moving swell of artificial noise. ""Himitsu"" is all dread and apprehension, with a series of steadily repeating drones acquiescing to a sinister hiss.</p>
<p>Much of this material is short and fragmented, creating moments that flicker into life then vanish before achieving full impact. The foreboding ""Kae"" barely makes it over the two-minute mark, invoking thoughts that stir when passing a stranger whose world just seems to have collapsed around them. It's that fleeting type of empathy, caught somewhere between feeling trapped in the role of passive observer and desperately wanting to reach out and touch, that <i>AUN</i> takes as its central focus. ""Euclides"" is a glimpse of a lonely transmission pinging into the atmosphere; ""Nympha"" is a two-and-a-half-minute wallow in cheerless reflection, crafted from untreated acoustic guitar and suppressed digital interference that barely rises up into the picture. The album is positioned that way to service the film, but it ends up carrying an irregular weight of its own, demonstrating how transitory sentiment can pack as much of a punch as fully-realized feelings.</p>
<p>Pitchfork's review of <i>Cendre </i>noted how the spare piano melodies can sometimes verge on melodrama. Two of the three songs pulled from that album for this collection (""Haru"" and ""Trace"") go down that route, but it's to Fennesz's credit that he focuses on creating a more unsettling form of ambience to flush out the rest of <i>AUN</i>. He also demonstrates how in control he is of his creations, never tumbling into something that could be described as obtrusive, always packing in tiny details that are revealed over multiple plays. The fact that this material was created to bolster (but not detract from) visual imagery only makes that feat even more impressive. These tracks don't repeat the trick of <i>Endless Summer</i> by creating whole worlds to get lost in. Instead, they work as miniature emblems of abstract emotional thought, the kind of things that float into our minds every day but don't necessarily make much sense just yet.</p></div>"|16828.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16828-aun/|7.2|Nick Neyland

They've drawn inspiration from the Mothers of Invention, 1950s doo-wop, Motown soul, 60s British Invasion pop, and garage rock. Their musical vision is expansive, but their perspective is narrow and specific: Savage and Kelly live to take the piss out of indie rock. What Frank Zappa was to San Francisco, these snarky Texans are to Williamsburg; they're outsiders pointing and laughing at the self-serious shenanigans perpetrated on the other side of the window. With <i>Funky</i>, Fergus &amp; Geronimo have created a concept record of Big Ideas-- something about alien invaders and cultural paranoia-- that plays like a gag on indie pretentiousness. Whatever else can be said about Fergus &amp; Geronimo, <i>Funky </i>is<i> </i>a worthy record for this moment in time, even when its weaknesses get in the way. </p>
<p>Speaking of weaknesses, <i>Funky </i>isn't as enjoyable as Fergus &amp; Geronimo's full-length 2011 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14968-unlearn/"" target=""_blank""><i>Unlearn</i></a>, even if it is more musically focused and muscular. <i>Unlearn </i>had better jokes, which were aimed with deadly accuracy at the trust-fund babies and trend-chasing yuppies currently populating the hippest realms of rock music. Beyond the quips, <i>Unlearn </i>made its most persuasive argument against the current state of indie with its very form: Misshapen, tossed-off, and <i>unprofessional </i>sounding, <i>Unlearn</i> seemed like a statement against the slick-ification of underground music. Savage and Kelly were clearly conversant with various musical styles, slipping in and out of genre guises with ease, but it was the ease (rather than the skill) that was emphasized. It recalled a time when self-identifying indie rockers made records on a lark, not to make a career. </p>
<p>It's tempting to compare Fergus &amp; Geronimo to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4567-ween/"" target=""_blank"">Ween</a>, especially since we now <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46681-ween-break-up/"" target=""_blank"">desperately need a new group</a> that can be funny while also being musically credible. Like Ween, Fergus &amp; Geronimo have rooted their latest record in a specific time and place in music history. <i>Funky </i>is Savage and Kelly's ""late 70s art-punk"" record, and the reference points are as obvious as they are keenly observed. The chugging ""No Parties"" is a perfect melding of the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/264-the-b-52s/"" target=""_blank"">B-52's</a> record with the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7758-devo/"" target=""_blank"">Devo</a> record. ""Roman Tick"" barks nonchalantly in a rapid-fire 90 seconds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11866-pink-flag-chairs-missing-154/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pink Flag</i></a>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4611-wire/"" target=""_blank"">Wire</a>. ""Spies"" sends the mid-60s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2304-the-kinks/"" target=""_blank"">Kinks</a> through a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4573-paul-weller/"" target=""_blank"">Paul Weller</a> filter. Toward the end of <i>Funky</i>, the album finally lives up to its title by pumping up the African polyrhythms of ""Marky Move"" in a nod to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4357-talking-heads/"" target=""_blank"">Talking Heads</a>. </p>
<p>If <i>Unlearn </i>seemed like two smartasses laughing into a tape recorder for 30 minutes, <i>Funky </i>suggests that Savage and Kelly are in the midst of turning Fergus &amp; Geronimo into an actual band. And, again, the Ween comparison looms; perhaps on the next record, Fergus &amp; Geronimo will finally display some serious Eddie Hazel-level instrumental chops. </p>
<p>But here's how Fergus &amp; Geronimo are not like Ween: Savage and Kelly don't go far enough. Where Ween were sick and dark and genuinely off-putting, fearlessly bounding down avenues of bad taste and full-on sociopathic rage, Fergus &amp; Geronimo are only slightly less polite than the groups they're mocking. <i>Funky Was the State of Affairs </i>is a nice record with some quality laughs and catchy songs, but it doesn't cut as deep as it could. Fergus &amp; Geronimo's goofiness belies its musical vision; it should leave a mark, rather than be easily brushed off. </p></div>"|16903.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16903-funky-was-the-state-of-affairs/|6.8|Steven Hyden

After that brief peak, Troy Ave was swept unceremoniously back into the rat race of MCs on the cusp. Undeterred by his failure to launch, he never stopped releasing music, and the past three years alone have brought his superb <i>Bricks in My Backpack</i> series. Ave has consistently improved with every instalment, reaching a head with latest release, <i>Bricks in My Backpack 3: The Harry Powder Trilogy</i>; the kind of street album against which early fans will one day measure his inevitable major-label debut.</p>
<p>If you couldn't tell by the tape's namesake, Troy Ave raps about selling drugs from an early age, and often. But he does so in a way that seems far more grounded then his white yacht, white linen, white girl-touting drug-rap contemporaries. He paints himself as Brooklyn's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlo_Stanfield"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marlo Stanfield</a>, a young hustler who's found local success to be so empowering that he can't be made to care about what's going on in the greater scope of the game. Fittingly, he's allotted guest spots almost exclusively to fellow New Yorkers: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29708-action-bronson/"">Action Bronson</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7480-fabolous/"">Fabolous</a>, and Avon Blocksdale. Ave is everything history tells us a Brooklyn rapper should be: clever, intuitive, smart-alecky, and relaxed. He references the most obvious cool-kid touchstones (the NBA, Basquiat, Young Jeezy), but makes it a point to thicken up his verses with vivid imagery, like the ""hustlers who wear shorts under they jeans."" He can put a proper song together, and raps the way someone with an alleged drug-dealing history as extensive as his own ought to.</p>
<p><i>BIMB3 </i>is well-sequenced, something too many tapes are missing. ""Lord as My Witness"" is heroic, built on a sappy organ loop with drill-team snare pops.<i> </i>The song itself is a shimmering example of dope-boy repentance, the chorus declaring, ""Where I'm from they don't give much, so I take mines and get paid/ Lord as my witness, as I bow my head and I pray/ Father forgive us, please keep the Feds away."" The tape's lead single, ""Cokeamania"", is more snarling, and threatens to ""shoot a nigga out they muthafuckin' shoes,"" sounding deviant in that way rappers do when they promise the kind of violence they'll never deliver. ""Snow"" is Ave detailing his coke dealing exploits over a soft xylophone riff that could've been pulled from an old Stax ballad. He's paired drug dealing with a sonic elegance it really shouldn't know. His wry sense of humor sees him singing a wounded Tracy Chapman-like refrain about there being ""no business like snow business.""</p>
<p>Later in the tape, Ave returns to grabbing his crotch in front of the bodega with ""N W Yay"". Over fluttering synths from producer Vokaron, he and Blocksdale warn of their wrath, likening their attitudes to the forefathers of urban angst, N.W.A. For ""Nightmare on Fed Street"", Ave adopts a bouncier flow for a song that sounds like Freddy Krueger's soundtrack for cleaning blood off his Air Jordans. The album's closer, ""Free Base"", is just ""BK, BK"", the track that fills the second half of his 2006 BET video, coming full circle.</p>
<p>To date, Brooklyn has known Herculean talents the likes of the Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z, and in a more modern sense, Fabolous. Fittingly, these are artists who've rapped their way out of obscurity trading on technical ability rather than the oft-referenced diversionary tactic that is swagger. Troy Ave is cut from this same cloth but has yet to find footing in his own time. The generational gap in Brooklyn's rap scene means there's a place free for a highly territorial young artist like Troy Ave. <i>Bricks in My Backpack 3: The Harry Powder Trilogy</i> shows off the voice Brooklyn deserves.</p></div>"|16932.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16932-bricks-in-my-backpack-3/|7.5|Felipe Delerme

Their first, 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10296-with-lasers/"" target=""_blank""><i>With Lasers</i></a>, was everything you'd probably want out of a drunken party. Innocently horny. Up for anything. Vaguely illicit but basically non-threatening. Fueled by loud, dumb, grungy beats, as if art-school punks had suddenly fixed on hip-house as the way forward circa 1989. And over before everything got stale, ugly, and embarrassing. </p>
<p>Unsubtle would be an understatement, and it certainly wasn't for every occasion. But if you needed to disengage your thinking brain and rock out to pomp-metal riffs, <i>With Lasers</i> was there for you that summer. It didn't leave Bonde many places to go, though. Who wanted to hear these sexed-up goofs grappling with aging and ambition? Their music was about unashamed crude enthusiasm, which generally promises a few killer singles rather than a multi-album career. </p>
<p>Stranger and cruder acts than Bonde have matured in interesting ways, though. Five years have passed since <i>With Lasers</i>, and a total sonic overhaul would be necessary to make <i>Tropicalbacanal</i> anything other than nostalgia for grubby bacchanals gone by. Which, luckily, is what we get, and it's a very good thing-- expanding Bonde's range in a major way without totally losing the head banging and hip thrusting that give them purpose. Dervish frontwoman Marina Ribatski is out, replaced by singer Laura Taylor, who the other Bondes found via open auditions in Brazil. In theory, Marina's absence should strip a lot of the personality from Bonde's music. In actuality, not so much. As a live presence, Marina had moxie to spare. On record, she couldn't quite get that on-stage intensity across all the time. The chirpy Taylor has enough moxie of her own, and Bonde wisely drafted in a few ringers to add some global color. And global color is what this album is all about.</p>
<p>Musically, <i>Tropicalbacanal</i> is bright as neon paint splashed against white walls, with hooks that make it as mindlessly enjoyable as a daylong piña colada session on one of those indie rock booze cruises. It's party music, pure and simple. The expiration date for this album is still sometime around when the weather gets cold. But it's also adventurous and audacious and assured, an album you may actually pull out <i>next</i> summer, a big leap from a band many had probably written off. It's beach music made by people who've grown up with ""beach music"" as a cultural heritage, but who don't feel the need to keep that heritage pure. </p>
<p>Grappling with their country's musical history doesn't exactly mean these kids have transmogrified into Milton Nascimento overnight, but it does mean they have certain standards to live up to. Brazilian don Caetano Veloso shows up at one point, and it says something that he fits neatly into the mix, rather than shaming the Bondes with an offhand display of old-dude skillfulness. And it probably helps that Brazil's vintage beach music is so melodically dense and polyrhythmically colorful. You can't just strum a few lazy surf chords, affect a Brian Wilson vocal, and call it a day. ""Puco"" barrels along, feeling loose and airy, even as it tries to pack as much detail into 2:15 as possible: multiple zigzagging lines of rhythm, guitars zinging across the beat, whistling, stuff that sounds like whistling but might be flutes, call-and-response vocals, something approximating a song. It's a tightly wound sound that requires work to feel so playful.</p>
<p>Bonde's rap influence is downplayed in general across <i>Tropicalbacanal</i>. We get it in brief but potent bursts, and it helps that the guest rappers can actually rap, unlike the charming but goony cargo-cult approximation Bonde were peddling before. The delirious horndogging of ""Brazilian Boys"" comes off fierce rather than silly, thanks to moonlighting Jamaican MC Ce'Cile's no-bullshit performance, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27916-das-racist/"" target=""_blank"">Das Racist's</a> Kool A.D. sounds tighter than he has in a while on his brief cameo in ""Bang"". The beats are far more varied than the eventually deadening baile funk stomp that ruled <i>With Lasers</i>. ""Kanye"" starts as an inexplicable mash of accordion, sampled chicken squawks, and robotically processed singing, only to explode into a head-banging soca track, the accordion still oompah-ing along at punk rock speed. And if some songs initially sound like paint-by-numbers Tropicália, there's usually a modern rhythmic idea banging around the corner. </p>
<p>This is also very much a guitar record, one that goes in far weirder, wilder directions than the cheesy butt-rock bites on Bonde's first album. Despite that aforementioned verse from Kool A.D., ""Bang"" actually sounds more like radio-ready garage rock, building not to a fuzz freakout but something like a Yosemite Sam gunfight in a Looney Tunes short. Distant kin to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5449-the-modern-lovers/"" target=""_blank"">the Modern Lovers</a>' ""Egyptian Reggae"", ""Kilo"" is a slice of catchy ethnic fakery, first wave rock'n'roll as imagined by an isolated garage band somewhere in Southeast Asia. And then re-imagined by a bunch of cheeky Brazilian kids who grew up with dancehall on their iPods. That cultural jumbling was always what Bonde was about, mixing hip-house with Alice in Chains, but they've never been as go-for-broke about it as they are here, or cast so widely in search of hooks. </p>
<p><i>Tropicalbacanal</i> is not a reverent retro record by any means, though it voraciously eats up influences from across the globe, and from throughout pop history. If it looks back to Brazilian classics from the 60s and 70s, it also mutates them via 21st-century sounds, and pumps them full of a lot of perverse personality. But only in flashes does it sound like the Bonde you know. Maybe it's a good thing if you come to this record with no preconceptions, because it often feels like the work of a new band looking to prove itself, and pulling it off.</p></div>"|16761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16761-tropicalbacanal/|6.0|Jess Harvell

This is happening at a time when black metal's grown increasingly ambitious and experimental, with bands incorporating styles and sounds that seem natural in 2012 only because borders have grown more porous. But after <i>Addicts</i>, a collection that opened with an industrial-style cheerleader chant and worked through plenty of acid-rock jamming (complete with extended saxophone workouts), stripping things down was the move to make. <i>Addicts</i> featured excellent material alongside some of the band's biggest clunkers.</p>
<p>But<i> Silencing Machine </i>isn't an orthodox record. Early on in his career, Nachtmystium founder, leader, and sole permanent member Blake Judd was clearly very into Darkthrone. Four years after the first Nachtmystium collection, you heard hints of something else on 2004's <i>Eulogy IV</i> EP, but it was 2006's surprisingly psychedelic, e-bow-heavy <i>Instinct: Decay</i>, where he finally showed he had more to offer than black metal by the books. For <i>Silencing Machine, </i>his band returns to the compellingly tweaked black metal foundation of <i>Instinct: Decay</i> with the knowledge they accrued over their more experimental records. </p>
<p><i>Silencing Machine</i> is <i>Instinct: Decay</i>'s next logical step. It's black metal from a group that knowingly references Nine Inch Nails in its album title. As Judd told me <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/8852-industrial-revolution/"" target=""_blank"">when we spoke recently</a>, ""I've always been into <i>The Downward Spiral</i>. It's one of those records that has never aged for me... I always liked the lyrics and I thought that line was a particularly sinister one. It was ringing out in my head, and with the industrial influence in the music, I thought it was a perfect title to this record."" That, and prior to <i>Silencing Machine</i>'s release, the band put out a 7"" that includes a B-side cover of Joy Division's ""The Eternal"" featuring Chris Connelly. The A-side, ""As Made"", sounded very much like Connelly's old band, Ministry. (It's also worth remembering that Judd also pilots <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47313-thurston-moore-joins-black-metal-band-twilight/"" target=""_blank"">Twilight</a>, the black metal ""supergroup"" that now features Thurston Moore. This is not your kid brother's kvlt act.)</p>
<p><i>Silencing Machine</i> is not as immediately exciting as the more colorful strands of the ""meddle"" stage, but it's a more consistent, cohesive record, one that rewards dozens of closer listens. What we have is black metal wallowing in a dark, swarming, industrial atmosphere. There isn't much pause; it's more seamless. There's no fat, in part because of the sequencing, but also because there's less focus on bells and whistles and more concentration on the songs themselves. Your mind doesn't wander because the compositions don't. </p>
<p>The focus on songs also means more hooks. All the tracks are complex and spacious with multiple parts. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13696-silencing-machine/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a> features limber, ringing guitars and almost post-punk breakdowns. The bouncy ""Decimation, Annihilation"" weaves sketchy synth parts into a weirdly ska-esque pulsation. The melancholic keyboards and drum machines that punctuate the sweltering ""Reduced to Ashes"" reminded me of an upgraded take on old-school USBM like Judas Iscariot. ""Borrowed Hope and Broken Dreams"" has a bassline reminiscent of Joy Division. ""Give Me the Grave"" moves with a deathrock feel and a full-on sing-along chorus of ""Fall to hell/ Fall to hell."" The best song on the album, ""The Lepers of Destitution"", is an eight-minute epic that has a gentle heart to it somehow; it almost comes off like a ballad, though it sounds nothing like the sort. You'll need to give the album a few listens; the sound is submerged, but hooks and distinct parts emerge, as well as a compelling sequencing. While listening to ""I Wait in Hell"", I found myself asking if there were horns buried in the mix.</p>
<p>This is also the first album since <i>Instinct: Decay</i> to feature lyrics mostly written by Judd, deepening the connection between the records. For the last couple of releases, the band's honorary member, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23247-dawnbringer/"" target=""_blank"">Dawnbringer</a> mastermind Chris Black, penned most of the words and handled the production. Judd told me that he tends to write wordier lines and therefore sings them differently, and he structures the songs around them in different ways: ""I tend to write more lyrics than Chris does, so there's just more vocals in general and more being said."" </p>
<p>The current lineup is more stable than any in the band's history. Instead of the makeshift crew he's put together in the past, Judd went into the studio with musicians who've already joined him on stage for hundreds of shows. They're a veteran team in general, their own sort of Chicago supergroup: Producer (and Twilight cohort) Sanford Parker handles synths and electronics, Will Lindsay of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/8717-best-albums-of-2011/"" target=""_blank"">Indian</a> (and ex-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4783-wolves-in-the-throne-room/"" target=""_blank"">Wolves in the Throne Room</a>, Middian, etc.) plays bass, Charlie Fell of Lord Mantis, ex-Von, etc., is the drummer, and Drew Markuszewski (aka Avinchi, ex-Von, and a member of Lord Mantis) plays guitar/offers backup vocals. This group congeals and coheres in a way the lineups of the past didn't, and it's the most live and lived-in-sounding record from Nachtmystium to date. You can imagine these songs in a club without triggers and laptops.</p>
<p>There are people doing rawer, more immediate black metal than this, and they're releasing albums that really bleed and feel decidedly underground. <i>Silencing Machine</i> is more than that. This is black metal that feels both raw and accessible, both secure in its genre conventions and happy to fuck with them. It's an impressive and stylish reinvention of an earlier form by a band that could've easily lost the plot, but instead reigned in the excess, and wrote us a new one.</p></div>"|16773.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16773-silencing-machine/|8.0|Brandon Stosuy

Fewer still have been as capable of doing their predecessor justice-- after all, this is the band that was recruited to give some sonic verisimilitude to the original productions of the musical <i>Fela!</i>. And in repaying the stylistic debt they've owed to the originator of Afrobeat for over a dozen years, the Brooklyn band has spent a handful of albums proving that it's an art form that can not only survive but thrive, artistically and politically, outside the context of 1970s Nigeria. When they put out <i>Who Is This America?</i> in the midst of 2004's turmoil, it was a rhetorical question: This was music that knew the country all too well and demanded some sort of acknowledgement that their deepest suspicions were correct.</p>
<p>On surface terms, the self-titled <i>Antibalas</i> could be pegged to some particular agitated movement in current socio-politics, where matters of class struggle and disenfranchisement are played out in movements that ebb, flow, splinter, get pushed to the background, yet never really go away. But for many people, financial exploitation, misguided law enforcement, and unsatisfying materialism aren't any more prevalent than they were when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/213-liberation-afro-beat-vol-1/"" target=""_blank""><i>Liberation Afro Beat Vol. 1</i></a> came out-- they're just more visible to people who wouldn't worry about it otherwise. Antibalas have used that inroads for a much-needed type of no-expiration-date protest music: They swap out didactic specificity for sneaky allegory, torn-from-the-headlines trendiness for generations of weight, and the catalytic spark of the freshly-minted young radical for the perseverance of the long-struggling citizen.</p>
<p>The first half of <i>Antibalas</i> is likely what's going to get the most play in that regard: it's here that frontman Amayo calls the most accessible shots as a protest singer, throwing a lot of weight behind a few simple truths. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13822-dirty-money/"" target=""_blank"">""Dirty Money""</a> feels like it fits in the context of the current Occupy Wall Street sentiment-- the Muppet-y class-structure feud of its <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMXlEqlnAIg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> hints at as much-- but the imagery of uselessly sinking coins tossed to a drowning man, as well as a quickly breaking rope of bills failing to keep a man from falling off the ledge of a building, could stand in for any long-running scenario where capital has tried to stand in for empathy and failed miserably. An allegory for the War on Terror, or the War on Drugs, or whatever war on an abstract concept that causes more grief than it prevents, ""The Rat Catcher"" is a fable about a man who sets up a trap that snares everything but the rats he intends to catch-- a trap that he keeps expanding until it inevitably locks him inside. (Even if he'd succeeded, ""When you catch two rats/ Hundred gon' come/ And when you catch 100 /10,000 go follow."") And if the message of ""Him Belly No Go Sweet"" predates any of us-- a fine house and fine clothes don't make for a fine life-- it's still delivered through a voice that believes old truths can be the most energizing ones.</p>
<p>Behind that voice, however, Antibalas reveal another way to advocate for collective empathy: This is the band at its most forcefully communicative as a unit, playing together with an efficiency that lives and breathes with one-take composure. Over the years, Antibalas have slowly but surely whittled away all the other, subtler Latin, jazz, and funk influences that were threaded through their strain of Afrobeat. In the process, they've become both a little less idiosyncratic and a fair amount tighter-- predictably reliable, maybe, but not in a context where sudden detours would be worth throwing off listeners (or dancers) anyways. It's still clear in the album's first half, of course; the call-and-response dynamic of Amayo and the backup vocalists runs on the same clairvoyant, conversational momentum that lets the rhythm section spar with the guitars and the horns retort briskly to the keyboards.</p>
<p>This is a band still given to bracing solos-- Victor Axelrod's highwire-balancing organs and clavinets and the heavy slipperiness of Martin Perna and Stuart Bogie's saxes in particular have become definitive highlights-- but they click best as a mass of finely tuned parts. And in the latter three tracks-- the rousing <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/afrodisiac-ep/id328206417"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Afrodisiac</i></a>-caliber ""Ari Degbe"", the midtempo tension-and-release of ""Ìbéjì"", the controlled-frantic windsprint of closer ""Sáré Kon Kon""-- it really comes to the forefront, sounding so second-nature that you take the complex interplay in the underlying grooves for granted. The fact that this album came from a mutual admiration of one particular forefather, and spread to a group where everyone shares some responsibility to do right by his music-- well, that's a statement in itself.</p></div>"|16913.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16913-antibalas/|7.5|Nate Patrin

They were just tools, admittedly helpful ones, aimed at people who got paid to make people dance. A remix might occasionally be radical or righteous enough to become an all-time anthem, or such an obvious improvement on second-rate source material that it might even replace the original in ravers' esteem. Most remixes, however, were raw materials; even the most fleshed-out were still made to be ""completed"" by a creative DJ in the mix.</p>
<p>And they usually still are. Just listen the <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/kompakt/excerpt-the-field-junior-boys-mix"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Junior Boys' remix</a> of ""Looping State of Mind"" from this three-track collection of remixes from the Field's 2011 <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15790-looping-state-of-mind/"" target=""_blank"">album of the same name</a>. It is as sonically sumptuous as any of the band's own recent material. Their ""Looping"" mix would make a sparkling little segue in someone's retro electro-pop set, but on its own, it's a just-okay instrumental, or maybe a Junior Boys song in search of the actual song.</p>
<p>In 2012, not much has changed about remixes except context. Dozens of remix EPs are still released each month, most of them still no big deal. This Field EP doesn't entirely transcend the limited appeal of a DJ tool, nor is it necessarily trying to, even as it gestures toward the home-listening crowd. True, at least two of these tracks (Blondes' and Mohn's) will probably please those who like to sit in dark rooms and conjure spooky mental movies. And at least two of these tracks (Blondes' and Junior Boys') will probably please those who need groove, whether their interest is as a professional or as a fan. But no one's gonna shut this thing off and feel their mind's been blown, their expectations scrambled, or that they've just heard the possibilities of the remix EP wildly expanded.</p>
<p>And that's fine. The pleasures here are traditional, and minor, but they're still pleasures. One thing you <i>can</i> say is that, for better or worse, none of these three tracks sounds much like the Field. The aforementioned Junior Boys mix is the most DJ-friendly and functional of the three, but it jettisons the wild textural overload that makes even the Field's most static music feel dive-in immersive rather than background-music inert. The result sounds aimless, and yet it's sequenced so precisely that all the juice and life has been wrung out.</p>
<p>Recording under their Mohn alias, the duo of Jörg Burger and Wolfgang Voigt takes <i>Looping</i>'s least Field-like track, the somber wintertime ambient of ""Then It's White"", and slows it even further, stretching the track's already woozy elements into pure shimmer and blur. It's undeniably beautiful stuff, understanding the lonely feeling at the heart of the original and somehow still communicating the same feeling through a much more abstract framework. But after hearing the inventive ways these old hands treated ambient fundamentals on their debut album from earlier this year, this is no more than a top-shelf <i>Pop Ambient</i> track. No bad thing, just not much surprise.</p>
<p>Which leaves us with Blondes' ""It's Up There"", which best illustrates the minor pleasures and perils of the remix commission that tries to be faithful to the project's objective (pleasing DJs and Field fans) while still bringing in a little of the remixer's own personality. Blondes string up shifting layers of live-sounding percussion over the track's seven minutes, braiding and layering and subtracting them according to logic no sequencer would understand. It's a jittery, basement-jam approach to house beatmaking that brings some not-unwelcome grit and hands-on energy into the Field's sleekest and most propulsive original, a song that represents the closest he's ever skirted the hands-aloft banality of trad trance.</p>
<p>But the track's also too bound to the original's forward-moving form. Those itchy, grotty drums never multiply, zigzag, and spiral out into the weirdo wilderness of Blondes' own best tracks. Ultimately, their ""It's Up There"" remains a muted trance tune with a novel rhythm overlay. It'll sound good for a time at the appropriate clubs, and it's a cool way to rehear the original. But much like this EP as whole, it's doing a job, however well, rather than trying to wow you. Maybe it just needs that creative DJ to take it all the way.</p></div>"|16873.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16873-looping-state-of-mind-remixe-ep/|4.5|Jess Harvell

The 12-year-old series is surely a huge influence on the most active ambient artists today. Historically, ambient music has gotten a lot of attention only when cloaked in familiar garb-- the flowing, songlike melodies of proto-ambient composer Erik Satie, the richly tonal piano intervals of Brian Eno's iconic <i>Music For Airports</i>, or the house beats of the Orb. While the vanishing point of ambient purity remains an obscure concern, the integration of musical structures and open forms has become so routine that it really needs no modifier: It's all just ambient now.</span></p>
<p>In the past few years, new challengers to the <i>Pop Ambient </i>throne have brought a curatorial freshness to the format, avoiding narrow branding to argue for the alloyed nature of the music. They eschew the term ""ambient"" to make sweeping claims upon a whole range of slow-moving electro-acoustic styles. The music is uniformly concerned with drawing fractured melodies and finely mercurial timbres into dreamlike unities, but the gestures stem from idioms as diverse as krautrock, dub, IDM, techno, shoegaze, film scores, field recordings, chamber music, and classical post-minimalism. To loosely draw a line around this tumult, Ghostly International contrived the broad, mysterious title <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15180-smm-context/""><i>SMM: Context</i></a>. <a href=""http://www.theagriculture.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Agriculture Records</a> co-founder James Healy makes similarly evocative claims with his <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/airtexture"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Air Texture </i></a>imprint, drawing attention to how all of this music makes invisible forces palpable.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.kompakt.fm/releases/air_texture_volume_i"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Air Texture Vol. I</i></a> was co-selected by reverb-shaman <a href=""http://www.bvdub.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">bvdub</a> and the skilled ambient classicist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13996-between-buildings-and-trees/"">Andrew Thomas</a>. The bullpen was full of artists associated with key labels such as Kompakt, Kranky, Type, and Touch. Two of those artists, Vancouver's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2530-loscil/"">Loscil </a>and Seattle's <a href=""http://www.irisarri.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rafael Anton Irisarri</a>, were called up to each select a disc of <i>Air Texture Vol. II</i>. Loscil's own music favors dark hues and emotionally unreadable impressions of submerged movement. He offers a compilation highlight in <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/airtexture/loscil-else-on-air-texture"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Else""</a>, where watery drones scoured with ringing textures mount into a pulmonary rhythm, thanks to a gouged dynamic range and a lone bass drum. Irisarri cultivates a reliable air of preoccupied melancholy via cavernous piano etudes, as demonstrated by his striking contribution, where a curt theme flashes between octaves over a chasm of moaning strings and shadowy resonance. This juxtaposition of perspectives on ambient music gives <i>Vol. II</i> the same variety and vitality as its predecessor.</p>
<p>Loscil's disc opens in ravishing but predictable fashion with ""At a Loss"" by Brian McBride. If you've ever heard a single elongated note of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3935-stars-of-the-lid/"">Stars of the Lid</a>, you can imagine the romantic strings paired with a piano theme's subdued climax. The disc swiftly builds momentum after this pacesetting start-- the abstract sound design of Chris Herbert's ""Naimina"", the almost perversely subtle arc of Rob Bridgett's ""Field 3"", and ""Dirge for the Canon"", where a brilliant organ gradually erupts in a fountain of sparks.</p>
<p>Irisarri's disc is easy to link to his sonic style. His fondness for saturated tonality is evident on Marcus Fjellström's ""The Eroding"", where a dusty record plays trailing woodwinds, as well as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4105-slowdive/"">Slowdive </a>drummer Simon Scott's ""Modena"", where delayed-attack drones lurch. Irisarri's post-minimalism is echoed in an austere <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5437-library-tapes/"">Library Tapes</a> selection, where a piano flickering with tremolo sways between two chords, and again in the hovering wisps of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28249-kyle-bobby-dunn/"">Kyle Bobby Dunn</a>, whose compositions feel like simple thoughts forming exceedingly slowly. The dense prismatic scream of <a href=""http://room40.org/site/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Room40</a> proprietor <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10567-lawrence-english/"">Lawrence English</a>'s ""Cooperative Drift"" and one of bvdub's darkly coruscating force fields bring this disc to an arresting conclusion. As a whole, the collection is an impressive assortment of techniques, lineages, and emotional shadings that converge inside what we call ambient music.</p></div>"|16933.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16933-air-texture-vol-ii/|7.6|Brian Howe

It's like his mind is a library of worn-out LPs, crackly field recordings, rare books in many languages, and found footage of a hidden global underground. And he turns those inspirations into songs as effortlessly as he might pull a record from a shelf. 2007's <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10701-polytheistic-fragments/"">Polytheistic Fragments</a> </i>is the best example of this catalog-surfing mode, and while <i>Intermezzo</i>, orginally self-released as a CD-R last year, isn't quite as sharp,<i> </i>it's even more rangy. If you stumbled on it playing interrupted on a late night <a href=""http://wfmu.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WFMU</a> show, you might not guess it's all by the same artist.</p>
<p>But you probably would. Because for as much time and effort as Bishop has devoted to his own personal history of creative subculture, he's matched that with his dedication to creating a recognizable guitar approach. Even in his most disparate work, there are so many common traits that it would be hard to list them all. The one that frequently stands out for me on <i>Intermezzo</i> is his monk-like patience. Every tune has a calm center-- a distinct lack of rush or nervousness-- that makes direction more compelling than details. As a result, even peppier elements like the African-tinted rhythm of ""Dance of the Cedars"", the Chet Atkins swing of ""Hump Tulip"", and the cascading chords of ""Dust &amp; Spurs"" feel serene.</p>
<p>Such patience earns patience from the listener in return, which is why I've come around on ""Inner Redoubt"", <i>Intermezzo</i>'s 15-minute centerpiece. The first couple of times I listened, I skipped to the next track after a few minutes, assuming I had heard all I needed to of Bishop's slow plucks and strums. I wasn't really wrong-- that's all the piece is made of, and at first it feels like an endless warm-up in search of an elusive starting line. But stick around for closer listens, and things open up. Small shifts and subtle turns get bigger and bolder as time stretches. The key is the way Bishop stays calm, injecting each note with a purpose that deserves to be absorbed rather than glossed over. That's true of the equally-hypnotic ""Cranial Tap"", though it's a third as long-- its pin-prick guitar sounds repetitive initially, but increasingly rich and textured once you've really dug in.</p>
<p>The pleasures of Bishop's music can be immediate, too. For me what hits quickest yet lasts longest are his more wistful, sentimental tunes. There's the Windham Hill-esque reflection of ""Molasses"", or on the other end of the mood spectrum, the chilling echo of ""Dhumavati"". But nothing quite matches the rising beauty of closer ""Khajuraho"", an Eastern-inflected mix of guitar wisps, creaking drone, and hovering, flute-like tones. There's creative thunder brewing inside this gem, yet it radiates the patience of a sunrise. Maybe that's the best way to think of Sir Richard Bishop's music-- as the calm not before the storm, but during it.</p></div>"|16896.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16896-intermezzo/|7.4|Marc Masters

It's a more complicated question than it seems. This is an album that's sold more than 10 million copies worldwide and was vigorously protested in certain quarters on its release. It has sat at the center of arguments about cultural exchange, cultural imperialism, and whether Simon was right to skirt the United Nations' cultural boycott of South Africa in order to record with black musicians from that country-- arguments that remain part of the record's story even as the tragedy of apartheid fades further from the headlines.</p>
<p>As unignorable as the context of the record is, there's no doubt in my mind that its songs transcend the context as listening experiences. These songs are astute and exciting, spit-shined with the gloss of production that bears a lot of hallmarks of the era but somehow has refused to age. Taken as a whole, the album offers tremendous insight into how we live in our world and how that changes as we get older. </p>
<p>The stories Simon tells on <i>Graceland</i> wouldn't have been told without the collaboration of the mostly South African musicians he worked with on the record. Their music sparked Simon's imagination after the commercial disappointment of 1983's <i>Hearts and Bones</i>, and the jam sessions he recorded with them in South Africa gave rise to all but a few of these songs. Simon learned to write differently by homing in on the ways guitarist Chikapa ""Ray"" Phiri varied his playing from verse to verse, and by grounding his vocal melodies on the basslines of Bagithi Khumalo. Khumalo's playing has such fluency and personality that, at least on the five songs he's a part of, this is nearly as much his record as anyone else's. On the brief disc of outtakes included in this set, there's a version of ""Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes"" that's stripped down to just vocals and bass, and his line so completely frames the song (rhythmically, harmonically, and melodically) that the other elements of the album version's arrangement are barely missed.</p>
<p>So we get songs where the groove came first, and the lyrics long after. Simon considered writing political songs about apartheid but quickly concluded that he wasn't very good at it and owed it to the other musicians involved to stick to his strengths. Still, the album's opening song, ""The Boy in the Bubble"", is a thriller that ties together threads of technological progress, medicine, terrorism, surveillance, pop music, inequality, and superstition with little more than a series of sentence fragments, all tossed off in the same deadpan delivery. The song sets a monumental stage on which the small dramas and comedies of the other songs can play out, and it also establishes the record's unsettled tone-- out of all these songs, only ""That Was Your Mother"" is sung from a settled place, and even that one is a reminiscence about itinerant life.</p>
<p>To have Simon's songs mingling with mbaqanga, township jive, shangaan music, zydeco and chicano rock, all played by their real practitioners, complemented the themes of dislocation, misplaced identity, and the meeting of worlds. ""You Can Call Me Al"" traces Simon's own arc on his trip to South Africa, beginning in confusion and ending in ecstatic realization-- he goes from""far away, in my well-lit home"" to, ""He sees angels in the architecture, spinning in infinity/ He says 'amen' and 'hallelujah.'"" </p>
<p><i>Graceland</i> was the first many of Simon's fans had heard of South Africa's black music. When I saw that this set included a two-hour documentary on the album, I wondered whether it would shy away from the issue of Simon's violation of the cultural boycott on South Africa, but to its credit, it doesn't. In fact, director Joe Berlinger uses a one-on-one conversation between Simon and Dali Tambo, the founder of Artists Against Apartheid and a one-time vocal critic of Simon, as a framing device for his story.</p>
<p>But more than Simon's single-minded devotion to his art and Tambo's ideological politics, the experience surrounding this album is best conveyed by the musicians who made it. They were violating the boycott, too, just by participating in a dialogue with non-South African musicians, and there's a moment where Ray Phiri describes a meeting he was called to in London with African National Congress officials while touring to support the album that speaks volumes. The ANC officials told Phiri that he was violating the boycott and had to go home, and his response was that he was already a victim of apartheid, and to force him to go home would make him a victim twice. In the end, Simon's assertion that <i>Graceland</i> helped put an emotional, human face on black South Africans for millions of people around the world doesn't seem off the mark. This set also comes with a DVD of the concert Simon and these musicians played with South African exiles Hugh Masekela and Miriam Makeba in Harare, Zimbabwe, in 1987, and the joy visible on stage and in the audience certainly speaks to that.</p>
<p>It's easy to overstate what <i>Graceland</i> was. It wasn't the first world-music album, as some critics claim. But it was unique in its total, and totally natural, synthesis of musical strains that turned out to be not nearly as different from each other as its listeners might have expected, and the result resonated strongly around the world and across generations.</p></div>"|16843.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16843-graceland-25th-anniversary-edition/|9.2|Joe Tangari

But relative to other stars in what's become known as the drill scene, <a href=""https://twitter.com/kingl"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">King Louie</a> could be described as a vet. The recent Sony/Epic signee has recorded a series of mixtapes since his 2008 mixtape debut, <a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/King-Louie-Boss-Shit-mixtape.13054.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Boss Shit</i></a>. At the end of last year, he dropped <a href=""http://indy.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/15002/king_louie_manupbandup.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two</a> <a href=""http://indy.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/15248/king_louie_manupbandup_2.html%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">compilations </a>intended to get new listeners up to speed; each was entitled <i>Man Up Band Up</i>, a phrase that Louie claims he invented. As it's been since the days of Rakim, flipping a rarely heard phrase into <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/search/man%20up%20band%20up"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">viral lingo</a> is a key part of the job description for the regionally successful rapper, and in those terms, King L remains one of the best. His latest mixtape, <i>Showtime</i>, could use some tighter quality control and suffers from a few production missteps, but its diversity of musical approaches, when combined with Louie's <i>sui generis</i> rap style, give a sense of real possibility.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Much like mixtape-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"" target=""_blank"">Gucci Mane</a>, Louie is the rare rapper whose flood-the-market distribution method encourages and rewards binge listening. And much like Gucci, Louie's lines are funnier than they might initially be given credit for, all densely packed jokes and knowing ironies hidden by a straight-faced ruthlessness that effortlessly conveys street edge without the appearance of effort. He's referred to the rapping on his debut as the ""old flow."" His new approach, which he's been working on over the course of the last two years, will base an entire song upon a particular cadence, with each line building into a hypnotic repeated pattern. It's a composition strategy that gives each verse its own cyclical logic. One of the reasons ""Bars"", from this year's <a href=""http://indy.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/16579/king_louie_the_motion_picture.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Motion Picture</i></a> mixtape, has become such a fan favorite (at shows in Chicago you can watch friendly crowds recite this chorus-free song line-for-line) is that it not only epitomizes, but foregrounds Louie's unique, pattern-based rap style.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The best example on <i>Showtime</i> is ""On Da Road"", which does include a chorus, albeit one that builds upon the same rhyme structure as the verses. ""On Da Road"" also highlights Louie's sardonic lyrical style, as the rapper-- no stranger to gun talk or profanity-- wraps up one verse: ""Irene, plus syrup/ New p's, mustard/ I'm a bad muther-cuss word."" If this discussion about patterns and cadences sounds disenchanting for fans of street rap putting a premium on so-called ignorance, it misses the key tension that makes rappers like Louie so interesting: In an era where flooding the market is your main strategy, how do you keep the music novel without burning all your creative energy? Louie's verses aren't interesting because of their intricacy, but because these kinds of rhythmic and lyrical games serve a function: the possibility of endless variety, running the gamut between predictable and unpredictable, and seeing how far he can push the boundaries of what makes rap interesting without losing his audience.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Of course, these kinds of cerebral exercises are worthwhile only when the songs are there too. Unlike <i>Motion Picture</i>'s less consistent selection (that tape was a compilation of guest verses and collaborations, primarily, along with two <a href=""http://youtu.be/xnTTYb80t8A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">excellent</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPUyhKKP5o4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">singles</a>), <i>Showtime</i> is a diverse tape with a core of very strong tracks. C-Sick, one of the most promising producers working behind Louie and the composer of his current street single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13669-val-venis/"" target=""_blank"">""Val Venis""</a>, contributes a title track, which has a screaming stratospheric sample in an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29765-araabmuzik/"" target=""_blank"">AraabMuzik</a> style. The Million $ Mano-produced ""Full of Dat Weed"" samples Young Bleed's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxVzhpcX_pM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">signature anthem</a> to great effect. ""Numbers"" finds Fredo Santana serving as the perfect gritty hook man while the production's twisting synthesizers give the track a unusually rugged cinematic ambiance. Future has already proven that the emotional potential of autotune is far from D.O.A., but there's something about the rugged survivalist anthem ""Hitta Shit"", a collaboration with Shorty K, that has a particular resonance, effortlessly capturing a the feel of reckless, damaged fatalism in song.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">While its high points are some of the most exciting rap currently being made, the tape overall could use some quality control; ""MUBU Gang"" has an odd dissonance that doesn't quite cohere, and the chainsaw production on ""It's Like That"" is sonically exciting the first time you hear it, and less so as the novelty wears off. Even on these tracks, Louie remains a consistent lyricist, new Chicago's deadpan class clown: ""Shoot the gun sideways like Dub C on <i>Friday</i>/ I know I really hit him cuz his funeral on Friday."" In a city with a high murder rate, this might feel like a callous trivialization, but in Louie's music, it almost seems to operate as a therapeutic form of gallows humor (or in his life, for that matter-- one of his close friends was killed earlier this year). <i>Showtime</i> isn't the home run some of his fans may have been waiting for, but its genuine diversity and ambition has a something-for-everyone feel that feels like a major step forward after spending most of late 2011 and early 2012 without much music in circulation.</p></div>"|16951.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16951-showtime/|7.5|David Drake

As soon as <a href=""http://capturedtracks.com"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Captured Tracks</a> heard a demo, the label signed them, released their first single, shared a video, and pretty much said ""stay tuned."" Then, because it's 2012 and that's how things are done now, the band revealed who they were: four twenty-somethings from Stockholm. Interviews with Holograms shared a common theme: ""The band's members are all very poor right now."" And thus far, their story's revolved around an unfortunate series of incidents: Their van got broken into on a support tour, they were stranded in France for almost two weeks with no money, they can't afford decent gear, and they're not sure if they'll be able to obtain work visas to tour the United States.</p>
<p>It's fitting, then, that in addition to offering synth-driven songs that nod to post-punk and hardcore, the themes and overall tone of Holograms' self-titled debut are ridiculously weighty. The most obvious example is ""You Are Ancient (Sweden's Pride)"", which lays out their country's history (Vikings, rape, Lutheran fearmongering) as something to be ashamed of. There's ""Memories of Sweat"", a hellish industrialization song carried by an urgent, ominous riff. The churning basher <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13121-abc-city/"" target=""_blank"">""ABC City""</a> is centered around the words ""isolation"" and ""desolation."" These themes are sung with a strong monolithic confidence, usually with two or three voices in unison. Taking on such onerous subject matter is a bold move for a young band to make on their first full-length.</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, they don't double down on the world-weary stuff for the entire album. ""Orpheo"" is a substantially quieter, more vulnerable song about longing. It halts the album's big picture focus for a moment and illustrates a love story with small, poignant details like pulling down the blinds ""vicariously."" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13629-chasing-my-mind/"" target=""_blank"">""Chasing My Mind""</a> opens with a joyful synth line, a ragged guitar drive, and eventually reveals itself as a love song, while ""Fever"" sounds almost sunny in its disposition. The lyrics aren't exactly complex (""she stayed in my mind forever""), but it's easy to find respite in those moments.</p>
<p>Even when they're digging into the grit of a country's flaws or society's problems, the synth-driven hooks can be outright jovial. The run in the middle of the album, from ""Apostate"" to ""ABC City"" to ""Stress"", showcases the band's versatility in melody writing: from a stilted funky rhythm to an unstoppable propulsive rock basher to a rolling, echoing, ska-leaning bassline. On paper, it's a delicate balancing act. Love songs? Monolithic vocals? Raw power rock'n'roll? Synthesizers? It's a tenuous mix, but throughout <i>Holograms</i>, the boys manage to string together all of those elements to create a cohesive, solid album.</p></div>"|16901.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16901-holograms/|7.1|Evan Minsker

Even in his most dense, abstract moments, there are melodies and rhythms bubbling below, and no matter how tuneful he gets, his sound burns at the edges and threatens to melt into chaos. At the times when he's doing his best work, he rides that divide like a skateboarder gliding on a rail, effortlessly shifting from side to side as though he's simply flipping a switch.</p>
<p>The single, 42-minute track that constitutes Glacial's first full-length album, <i>On Jones Beach</i>,<i> </i>is one of those times. Teaming with David Watson and drummer Tony Buck-- both of whom also know how to blur boundaries-- Ranaldo extends his guitar attack into one of its most all-encompassing expressions ever. The group doesn't just morph melody and abstraction; at various points they sound like a drone symphony, a free-jazz experiment, an improvised-rock power trio, an ambient ensemble, and a confrontational noise outfit.</p>
<p>Yet thinking of <i>On Jones Beach </i>as an assembly of stylistic parts would miss its core sonic unity. That unity comes from how smoothly the group merges modes and textures, but more so from the energy they inject throughout. I find myself focused less on what any given moment sounds like than how compelling that sound is. Often it's also oddly catchy; even the densest sections have a semblance of hook. The result is like an instrumental rock song blown up so that every build-up, crescendo, and denouement becomes its own universe.</p>
<p>In that sense, <i>On Jones Beach </i>recalls <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/5096-the-dead-c/"">the Dead C</a>, who possess a similar gift for turning massive din into primal rock (Buck is particularly deft at simple, hypnotic beats). It's also tempting to hear parallels to <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/3872-sonic-youth/"">Sonic Youth</a>, since this was recorded in the band's Echo Canyon studios in 2005, the year in between <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7348-sonic-nurse/"">Sonic Nurse</a> </i>and <i><a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9059-rather-ripped/"">Rather Ripped</a></i>. But I don't detect any direct connections between where that group was at that point and what Glacial are up to here. The trio is distinctly its own beast, especially when Watson trades his guitar for bagpipes. It's stunning how he can make that decidedly non-rock instrument sound like a guitar, and just as stunning how unique it sounds when it takes center position in Glacial's evolving mix.</p>
<p>The digital download that comes with the LP-only <i>On Jones Beach </i>offers a version of the title track that's five minutes longer, as well as three more pieces recorded prior to the Echo Canyon session. Two come from Buck's first live appearance with the group in 2003 (Ranaldo and Watson had previously used a rotating cast of drummers); a third is taken from a 2006 gig at the late NYC avant-garde mecca Tonic. The latter is particularly interesting, offering chiming Ranaldo tones and a closing sax-like burst of Watson's bagpipes. But as good as they are, none of these three additions matches the urgency and drive of ""On Jones Beach"".</p>
<p>In fact, it's hard to think of much else in any of these three musicians' careers that compares to this epic piece. Perhaps those careers are so rich and accomplished that, in the calm light of reflection, words like ""best"" don't really apply. But when <i>On Jones Beach </i>is playing, I'm convinced this is one of the best records Ranaldo, Buck, and Watson have ever taken part in.</p></div>"|16895.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16895-on-jones-beach/|8.0|Marc Masters

Each of the band's five full-lengths-- including their first in five years, the enormous and exhausting <i>Atra Mors</i>-- trudges well beyond the hour mark, slowly pushing its respective way toward the limits of a compact disc or a two-LP set. But long albums alone don't make for notable ones; rather, Evoken pair that love of length with a near-militaristic obsession with volume, mass, and deliberate movement. Their records tend to supply a sense of seismic upheaval, whether through the rumble of a rhythm section that plods with the heaviest of them before springing into short, crushing bursts or the choking-world roar of frontman John Paradiso. If funeral doom is among the most oppressive forms of music, Evoken have undoubtedly become one of its most ambitious and aggressive practitioners by creating their own, all-involving worlds from the form's dimly lit sounds. <i>Atra Mors</i>, then, is a proud, punishing return. </p>
<p>Aside from the break in productivity that preceded it, the most noteworthy aspect of <i>Atra Mors</i> that separates it not only from the band's back catalog, but also from many of its sometimes more direct peers, is its motion and misdirection. More than ever, Evoken seem ready to put all the elements of their sound-- the textural thickness and the unmitigated forcefulness, the bludgeoning metal and the symphonic scope-- to work at once. During the opening title track, for instance, creeping expanses of doom lunge into quickened bits of razor-wire vitriol. Keyboards cut beneath and between it all, not only thickening the sound but stringing the pieces together. ""The Unechoing Dread"" lingers in a strangely liminal space, teetering between ghoulish washes and stentorian barrages, between blackened builds and drone deconstruction. Aside from two instrumental interludes, no track on <i>Atra Mors</i> is easily classified, as the band creates a cycling continuum of the ideas it's long championed rather than separate sprawls of them.   </p>
<p>Combined with <i>Atra Mors</i>' run time, that quality renders the album as an in-or-out event, a vacuum that tends to seal its listener off from surroundings; in short, it's loud, twisted, and daunting enough to necessitate complete attention. As if by way of acknowledgement, ""An Extrinsic Divide""-- a song about being trapped in halls of futility, where ""hope is only a mockery of its own illusion""-- bends time both forward and backward. After fading from a four-on-the-floor stomp and before heaving toward a Meshuggah-mechanical passage, Paradiso and guitarist Chris Molinari push and pull the riff, stretching it like wire across the beat. It's disorienting and thrilling, the sort of out-of-body experience that bands create when they suspend the listener in a world of their own curation. It's not unlike the effect of the Grateful Dead or even drone music, where subtle changes within a much bigger system provide thrills beyond the surface.   </p>
<p>That said, <i>Atra Mors</i> isn't an easy or amicable listen. In the time since 2007's <i>A Caress of the Void</i>, acts within several spheres of extreme metal have added more accessible flourishes, whether that's the gray and sometimes kaleidoscopic layers within the folds of recent blackness or the strings finally cutting through the weight of Sunn O))). Pieces of <i>Atra Mors</i> are indeed beautiful, like the sweeping strings and broadly brushed acoustic guitar of interlude ""Requies Aeterna"" or the relative calm that begins and occasionally bisects the destructive <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13818-descent-into-chaotic-dream/"" target=""_blank"">""Descent Into Chaotic Dream""</a>. For some listeners, that track and several brief impasses during a few others might even suggest the steely-eyed post-rock start of Slint. But those are details within a marathon of unrepentant, unrelenting torment, an obstacle course that rewards endurance with one of the most malevolent, majestic hours of music since Evoken eked out their last one. After all, though closer ""Into Aphotic Devastation"" begins with a triumphant guitar riff and hints at some sort of cleansing coda, Evoken soon toughen up. Layers of noise and echoes of Paradiso's menace wrap beneath unsteady builds toward a series of full-volume blasts. Surprisingly, Evoken spend the last few minutes relaxing the meter and the volume, a synthesizer's distant, pretty peal slowly merging with the collapsing roar. The torment goes on forever, the quintet seems to imply, even when they step away for a while.</p></div>"|16871.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16871-atra-mors/|7.7|Grayson Currin

<p>Or, you know, don't choose. Blur have been a band for 21 years, and their story is long enough to speak a bunch of contradictions. That's what happens to bands that house four egos and a pair of dueling geniuses. They rarely move in straight lines. One example of many: Blur arrived in New York for the first time on the day <i>Nevermind</i> was released. When asked on radio what they thought of the new Seattle sound, Graham Coxon said, ""I fucking hate it."" Later he'd be the one to lead the band toward a post-grunge, indie-tinged sound, a nugget of which will be blared alongside ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" at sports arenas until the end of time. Another? In 1994, Damon Albarn wrote a snide little number about the cultural allure of the West (sneeringly: ""La-la-la-la-la/ He'd like to live in Magic America/ With all the magic people""). Three years on, he was a bit more forgiving (one more time, with earnestness: ""Look inside America/ She's alright/ She's alright""). It's not <i>despite</i> but <i>because</i> of these pivots and complexities that it feels appropriate to call Blur a defining band of the past two decades.</p>
<p>Up until now, listeners have been urged to take one of two positions: 1) ""Great pop band, until they went to America and sold out!""; or 2) ""The early stuff is too British, but I love all that weird shit they did later on."" There was a sense that you couldn't love it all-- the witty, theatrical, Kinks-inspired character sketches perfected on 1994's <i>Parklife</i> <i>and</i> the impressionistic elegies of their 1999 sad-bastard masterstroke, <i>13</i>. And the choice was loaded. Think I'm exaggerating? Just read some of the reviews of their last two greatest-hits collections, 2000's <i>Best of Blur</i> and 2009's <i>Midlife</i>, both of which favored their later stuff. ""Let Blur bash their way on towards the margins,"" Steve Sutherland <a href=""http://www.vblurpage.com/articles/albums/bestof_nme.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a> defensively in a 2000 issue of <i>NME</i>. ""Just because these [early] songs embarrassed them once they started listening to broadsheet critics and retreated wounded from the big-sales battle with Oasis doesn't mean that we're morons to love them."" Nine years later, Scott Plagenhoef observed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13168-midlife-a-beginners-guide-to-blur/"">on this site</a>, ""Few bands from the 90s increased their stature this decade among America's self-identifying indie set as much as Blur."" <i>Midlife</i>, he said, ""can be seen as a more Americentric look at Blur's career, which makes some sense as they still have a lot of fanbase growth potential in the States.""</p>
<p>Three years after <i>Midlife</i>-- and with the whole world turned to their second reunion at the London Olympics closing ceremony-- it's time for a truce. So here it is, <i>Blur 21</i>, the inevitable box set comprising all seven albums, three DVDs, and five-and-a-half hours' worth of rarities. And even if you can't afford the thing on vinyl, its very existence presents us with the perfect opportunity to rethink the band's history. Because for its breadth and complexity, the box actually tells a simple story: Blur are a band that did an astonishing amount of different things really, really well.</p>
<p>Be patient, though, because we're going to start at the beginning, and their 1991 debut, <i>Leisure</i>, is not very good. It shows a melodic gift and hints at the Syd Barrett obsession that would plant seeds for future experimentation (""Sing""). But mostly, it's the work of a band still searching for its identity. Prior to signing with the London label Food Ltd., Blur were known as Seymour, a madcap art-punk four-piece that generated a mild buzz in late-80s London with their boozy, chaotic live shows. That anarchic energy is all but absent from <i>Leisure, </i>though it's captured on the box's first disc of rarities, including early Seymour demos and a 7"" containing the endearingly awkward baby picture ""Superman"".</p>
<p>When <i>Leisure</i> came out, baggy was all the rage in the UK. The label's intention was to turn Blur into the next Stone Roses-- or better yet, the even better-selling Food signees Jesus Jones. They wanted Blur's first single to be the baggy-by-numbers ""I Know"" but, in the first of many well documented band-vs.-label throw-downs, the band fought for the shoegazey ""She's So High"". Blur won, and 21 years later, this art-over-commerce victory feels prophetic, even if the song doesn't. ""High"" is still a better track than ""I Know"", but it has a kind of time-stamped anonymity that pervades even the best moments of <i>Leisure</i>: pretty, vacant, and vague.</p>
<p>1992 would light a fire under Blur, kindled by a few factors: a bad management contract that left them in significant debt; critical and commercial disappointment; intra-band conflict (a flame that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46622-producer-damon-albarn-halts-work-on-new-blur-album-to-the-surprise-of-the-rest-of-the-band/"">never stopped burning</a>); and, above all, grunge. Blur toured North America for the second time that year. And just a year into the post-<i>Nevermind</i> world, flannel, disaffectedly mumbled lyrics, and buzzsaw guitars were the new normal. ""Nothing in England counted and that really pissed us off,"" Albarn recalled in 1999. ""So we decided to make a record as English as possible; a record full of English references and English cultural icons."" Therein lies the irony of their breakthrough 1993 album, <i>Modern Life Is Rubbish</i>. Though it wouldn't hit big in America, it was conceived with the same spirit of roguish overthrow as <i>Nevermind</i> itself. Albarn's newfound articulateness was, actually, an act of punk rebellion, a sneering rejection of the status quo.</p>
<p>The artistic leap between <i>Leisure</i> and <i>Modern Life Is Rubbish</i> is roughly the same size as the one between <i>Pablo Honey</i> and <i>The Bends</i>: unpredictably huge. It's a statement record in title, sound, and content. What else can be said of an album that begins with a once-upon-a-time as dramatic as, ""He's a 20th-century boy..."" and draws upon an lineage of English guitar pop ranging from the Kinks to the Who to T. Rex? Blur would improve on these ideas on their next few records, but <i>Modern Life</i> remains a finely observed, tartly disillusioned snapshot of post-Thatcher Britain, buoyed by exquisite pop hooks. ""Colin Zeal"" and ""Chemical World"" also mark Albarn's first forays into the character study songs he'd later become known for. Into theater since his teens, Albarn would occasionally let drop in interviews that his greatest influences were Brecht, Weill, and Artaud's ""theater of cruelty."" <i>Modern Life</i> began to fulfill that promise: Blur were suddenly a band of ideas, though none so pompous that it weighed down the immediacy of their music.</p>
<p><i>Parklife</i> is the masterpiece of this era. Pop-art bright, stingingly funny, and at times suddenly poignant, it remains the defining artifact of Britpop. It's a nationalistic record in the same way <i>Born in the USA</i> is a nationalistic record: It might look like sloganeering patriotism if viewed from outer space, but up close it's a finely detailed, intricately cracked document of a very particular national malaise. The disco smirk ""Girls &amp; Boys"" (propelled by one of Alex James' best basslines) finds its hedonistic vacationers ""avoiding all work, 'cause there's none available,"" while the tragicomic ""Tracy Jacks"" sketches a lonely civil servant who goes quietly mad. With humor, pathos, and nostalgia, <i>Parklife</i> tells of a modern world where dreams have been boxed in by materialism, conformity and routine, and even the once-space-age future has lost its sparkle. ""End of the century,"" Albarn shrugs over Coxon's minor chords. ""It's nothing special.""</p>
<p>The millions-selling, Brit-Award-sweeping <i>Parklife</i> was also the record that made Blur into bona fide pop stars, a role that some members embraced more readily than others. ""I made a point of drinking two bottles of champagne a day for 18 months,"" is how bassist Alex James remembers 1994. ""England only imports something like 100,000 bottles a year, so I reckon I drank 1% of England's total champagne import."" At that point Coxon was, arguably, drinking even more, but without the joie de vivre; instead, he was increasingly uncomfortable with the band's success. <i>The Great Escape</i>, the improbably strong 1995 effort they churned out amidst the squeals of <i>Parklife </i>mania, is fittingly a record of baroque excess (lots of brass) and tension. It's Blur's poppiest album, but it's puffed within an inch of bursting: ""Stereotypes"", ""Charmless Man"", and ""Entertain Me"" are all deceptively dark, stretched like a smile pulled eerily tight. <i>Escape</i>'s crown jewel is the brilliant, Pulp-like single ""The Universal"", an exploration of anhedonia, a state of mind the band knew intimately at this point. Coxon retreated further, and for a moment it looked like he'd leave the band. What happened, though, was just the opposite. He steered them toward their biggest re-invention yet.</p>
<p>""Death of a Party"" (which now sounds like the first proto-Gorillaz Blur song) is the most apt song title on 1997's <i>Blur</i>. Recorded partially in self-imposed exile in Iceland, it is a post-success record, what happens when the odd burdens of mega-fame don't destroy a band but instead sends it diving into uncharted waters. It is 1995's hangover. Exquisitely bleary-eyed (""I'm Just a Killer for Your Love"", the oddball sprawl of ""Essex Dogs"") and often jolting (""M.O.R."", ""Chinese Bombs""), <i>Blur</i> sounds like staying up for six days and then accidentally catching a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. And somehow, amidst the claims of career suicide, it was a huge international hit, the one that finally broke them in the States. (Which is to say that yes, this is the ""Song 2"" album.)</p>
<p>Blur found Pavement in the mid 90s the way Dylan found Jesus in the late 70s: The transfiguration was that complete, that apparent, that difficult for longtime fans to swallow. Coxon had long been evangelizing American indie rock to his bandmates, and, wearied of fame and looking for a new direction, they finally started to listen. To call <i>Blur</i> Coxon's record is a huge simplification (it also marks the height of Albarn's Bowie phase), but it does contain the first song that Coxon wrote and sang on a Blur record, the sweetly wooly ""You're So Great"". Much has been made of the Pavement and Dinosaur Jr. influence on his virtuosic playing, but Coxon has said that the record he was listening to most while making <i>Blur</i> was Big Star's elegiac <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i>. Alex Chilton was an artistic kindred spirit for Coxon. Both had experienced intense, <i>Tiger Beat</i>-cover-style adoration (Chilton had a No. 1 song with the Box Tops before he was 18) and had figured out early on that commercial success wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Chilton, of course, lost his foil too early when Chris Bell left Big Star and died in a car crash not long after. The tension that kept Blur going, in a creatively fertile, decade-long state of about-to-combust, was the push and pull between Coxon and Albarn.</p>
<p>""Graham used to say that he wanted to make an album that nobody would want to listen to,"" says drummer Dave Rowntree in the box's liner notes, ""But you can't do that in a band with Damon."" <i>13</i>, their second masterpiece, finds Albarn and Coxon's opposing sensibilities bleeding into each other like a muddy watercolor. Both were hurting. Coxon was depressed and still at odds with the rest of the band, and Albarn's long relationship with Elastica's Justine Frischmann had just ended. A coping method he'd picked up from blues and DIY alike, Coxon knew how to translate personal pathos into Blur's music. Both the Blur songs on which he sings lead, ""You're So Great"" and <i>13</i>'s ""Coffee and TV"", are candidly about his drinking, and on <i>13</i>, he guided Albarn toward confessional songwriting, too. Albarn had always used character songs to express emotion, but his songs on <i>13</i> strip away the protective covering of wit. ""I hope you're with someone who makes you feel safe in your sleep,"" he croaks on the gorgeous closing lament ""No Distance Left to Run"", while the wounded pop-spiritual ""Tender"" is an obvious career highlight. William Orbit's brilliant, painstaking production pushes Albarn's ever-present pop sensibility to the brink of dissolve. The <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i> comparison feels more apt here: <i>13</i> is a record in a sustained state of elegant unravel, full of the unexpectedly beautiful sounds that pop songs (and people) make while they're falling apart.</p>
<p>As time goes on, <i>13</i> sounds more like a definitive statement, and 2003's <i>Think Tank</i> sounds more like a post-script. Recorded in Morocco after the first Gorillaz record and Coxon's departure (he plays on just one track, the gloomy ""Battery in Your Leg""), it may be the only Blur record that suffers in retrospect. There are some great tracks (""Out of Time"" and ""Sweet Song"") but it doesn't quite pack the punch it did a decade ago. On the other hand, the newest track in the box, the archly grand ""Under the Westway"", feels like a return to form, which is to say it finds the band sounding like it hasn't quite sounded before. In the liner notes, James points to something true, recalling the <i>Think Tank</i> tour: ""It took at least four people to replace what [Coxon] does. Two backing singers, another guitarist, and a lead guitarist. And a percussionist."" Now that the band is-- tentatively, feebly, and contemptuously as ever-- back together, it's even more clear that Blur is the alchemy between these four people.</p>
<p>Like any box set worthy of attention, the sprawl of rarities offers some illuminating gems (an early demo of ""Beetlebum""; the underrated oddball 1992 single ""Popscene""), plenty of cheeky throwaways (a Seymour-era cover of ""Maggie May""; an orchestral pop snippet called ""Sir Elton John's Cock""), and, of course, omissions for never-satisfied diehards to whine about (mine include the original, <i>Leisure</i>-era recording of ""1992"" and the mid-tempo demo of ""Song 2""). The box also contains DVDs of two complete live performances, which tell two very different tales. The first is a show at Alexandra Palace in North London from October 1994. Blur are at the height of their first wave of fame, and the young audience is whipped into such a frenzy that they even sing along with the melody of the instrumental filler ""Lot 105"", as if they just need something to scream; the band gets off on it. Five years later, they are at Wembley Arena playing all 20 of their singles in chronological order. They look as weary as second-term presidents as they slog through the motions for the first three-quarters of the setlist, but at ""Tender"" everything shifts. Suddenly, they embody the material, coming achingly alive again, reborn on the stage.</p>
<p>If you need a through-line, try the story that those selected bookends tell: Blur are a triumph of feeling. They spent the first half of their career creating modern characters who'd become fashionably distanced from their own emotions and the next half actually, unfashionably, emoting. But that's just one straight line you could draw; why should you have to choose? Modern life is full of champagne and hangovers. So is Blur.</p></div>"|16877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16877-blur-21/|8.5|Lindsay Zoladz

Go pop, then spend a decade slowly deflating; study the songbook so you can tear it up with precision. Choose irony, choose sincerity.

Choose Ray Davies, choose Stephen Malkmus; choose la-la-la or wooo-hoo. (And before you answer this next one know that the Queen is watching.) Choose Britain. Choose America.</p>
<p>Or, you know, don't choose. Blur have been a band for 21 years, and their story is long enough to speak a bunch of contradictions. That's what happens to bands that house four egos and a pair of dueling geniuses. They rarely move in straight lines. One example of many: Blur arrived in New York for the first time on the day <i>Nevermind</i> was released. When asked on radio what they thought of the new Seattle sound, Graham Coxon said, ""I fucking hate it."" Later he'd be the one to lead the band toward a post-grunge, indie-tinged sound, a nugget of which will be blared alongside ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" at sports arenas until the end of time. Another? In 1994, Damon Albarn wrote a snide little number about the cultural allure of the West (sneeringly: ""La-la-la-la-la/ He'd like to live in Magic America/ With all the magic people""). Three years on, he was a bit more forgiving (one more time, with earnestness: ""Look inside America/ She's alright/ She's alright""). It's not <i>despite</i> but <i>because</i> of these pivots and complexities that it feels appropriate to call Blur a defining band of the past two decades.</p>
<p>Up until now, listeners have been urged to take one of two positions: 1) ""Great pop band, until they went to America and sold out!""; or 2) ""The early stuff is too British, but I love all that weird shit they did later on."" There was a sense that you couldn't love it all-- the witty, theatrical, Kinks-inspired character sketches perfected on 1994's <i>Parklife</i> <i>and</i> the impressionistic elegies of their 1999 sad-bastard masterstroke, <i>13</i>. And the choice was loaded. Think I'm exaggerating?

<p>If you need a through-line, try the story that those selected bookends tell: Blur are a triumph of feeling. They spent the first half of their career creating modern characters who'd become fashionably distanced from their own emotions and the next half actually, unfashionably, emoting. But that's just one straight line you could draw; why should you have to choose? Modern life is full of champagne and hangovers.

Choose Ray Davies, choose Stephen Malkmus; choose la-la-la or wooo-hoo. (And before you answer this next one know that the Queen is watching.) Choose Britain. Choose America.</p>
<p>Or, you know, don't choose. Blur have been a band for 21 years, and their story is long enough to speak a bunch of contradictions. That's what happens to bands that house four egos and a pair of dueling geniuses. They rarely move in straight lines. One example of many: Blur arrived in New York for the first time on the day <i>Nevermind</i> was released. When asked on radio what they thought of the new Seattle sound, Graham Coxon said, ""I fucking hate it."" Later he'd be the one to lead the band toward a post-grunge, indie-tinged sound, a nugget of which will be blared alongside ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" at sports arenas until the end of time. Another? In 1994, Damon Albarn wrote a snide little number about the cultural allure of the West (sneeringly: ""La-la-la-la-la/ He'd like to live in Magic America/ With all the magic people""). Three years on, he was a bit more forgiving (one more time, with earnestness: ""Look inside America/ She's alright/ She's alright""). It's not <i>despite</i> but <i>because</i> of these pivots and complexities that it feels appropriate to call Blur a defining band of the past two decades.</p>
<p>Up until now, listeners have been urged to take one of two positions: 1) ""Great pop band, until they went to America and sold out!""; or 2) ""The early stuff is too British, but I love all that weird shit they did later on."" There was a sense that you couldn't love it all-- the witty, theatrical, Kinks-inspired character sketches perfected on 1994's <i>Parklife</i> <i>and</i> the impressionistic elegies of their 1999 sad-bastard masterstroke, <i>13</i>. And the choice was loaded. Think I'm exaggerating? Just read some of the reviews of their last two greatest-hits collections, 2000's <i>Best of Blur</i> and 2009's <i>Midlife</i>, both of which favored their later stuff. ""Let Blur bash their way on towards the margins,"" Steve Sutherland <a href=""http://www.vblurpage.com/articles/albums/bestof_nme.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a> defensively in a 2000 issue of <i>NME</i>. ""Just because these [early] songs embarrassed them once they started listening to broadsheet critics and retreated wounded from the big-sales battle with Oasis doesn't mean that we're morons to love them."" Nine years later, Scott Plagenhoef observed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13168-midlife-a-beginners-guide-to-blur/"">on this site</a>, ""Few bands from the 90s increased their stature this decade among America's self-identifying indie set as much as Blur."" <i>Midlife</i>, he said, ""can be seen as a more Americentric look at Blur's career, which makes some sense as they still have a lot of fanbase growth potential in the States.""</p>
<p>Three years after <i>Midlife</i>-- and with the whole world turned to their second reunion at the London Olympics closing ceremony-- it's time for a truce. So here it is, <i>Blur 21</i>, the inevitable box set comprising all seven albums, three DVDs, and five-and-a-half hours' worth of rarities. And even if you can't afford the thing on vinyl, its very existence presents us with the perfect opportunity to rethink the band's history. Because for its breadth and complexity, the box actually tells a simple story: Blur are a band that did an astonishing amount of different things really, really well.</p>
<p>Be patient, though, because we're going to start at the beginning, and their 1991 debut, <i>Leisure</i>, is not very good. It shows a melodic gift and hints at the Syd Barrett obsession that would plant seeds for future experimentation (""Sing""). But mostly, it's the work of a band still searching for its identity. Prior to signing with the London label Food Ltd., Blur were known as Seymour, a madcap art-punk four-piece that generated a mild buzz in late-80s London with their boozy, chaotic live shows. That anarchic energy is all but absent from <i>Leisure, </i>though it's captured on the box's first disc of rarities, including early Seymour demos and a 7"" containing the endearingly awkward baby picture ""Superman"".</p>
<p>When <i>Leisure</i> came out, baggy was all the rage in the UK. The label's intention was to turn Blur into the next Stone Roses-- or better yet, the even better-selling Food signees Jesus Jones. They wanted Blur's first single to be the baggy-by-numbers ""I Know"" but, in the first of many well documented band-vs.-label throw-downs, the band fought for the shoegazey ""She's So High"". Blur won, and 21 years later, this art-over-commerce victory feels prophetic, even if the song doesn't. ""High"" is still a better track than ""I Know"", but it has a kind of time-stamped anonymity that pervades even the best moments of <i>Leisure</i>: pretty, vacant, and vague.</p>
<p>1992 would light a fire under Blur, kindled by a few factors: a bad management contract that left them in significant debt; critical and commercial disappointment; intra-band conflict (a flame that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46622-producer-damon-albarn-halts-work-on-new-blur-album-to-the-surprise-of-the-rest-of-the-band/"">never stopped burning</a>); and, above all, grunge. Blur toured North America for the second time that year. And just a year into the post-<i>Nevermind</i> world, flannel, disaffectedly mumbled lyrics, and buzzsaw guitars were the new normal. ""Nothing in England counted and that really pissed us off,"" Albarn recalled in 1999. ""So we decided to make a record as English as possible; a record full of English references and English cultural icons."" Therein lies the irony of their breakthrough 1993 album, <i>Modern Life Is Rubbish</i>. Though it wouldn't hit big in America, it was conceived with the same spirit of roguish overthrow as <i>Nevermind</i> itself. Albarn's newfound articulateness was, actually, an act of punk rebellion, a sneering rejection of the status quo.</p>
<p>The artistic leap between <i>Leisure</i> and <i>Modern Life Is Rubbish</i> is roughly the same size as the one between <i>Pablo Honey</i> and <i>The Bends</i>: unpredictably huge. It's a statement record in title, sound, and content. What else can be said of an album that begins with a once-upon-a-time as dramatic as, ""He's a 20th-century boy..."" and draws upon an lineage of English guitar pop ranging from the Kinks to the Who to T. Rex? Blur would improve on these ideas on their next few records, but <i>Modern Life</i> remains a finely observed, tartly disillusioned snapshot of post-Thatcher Britain, buoyed by exquisite pop hooks. ""Colin Zeal"" and ""Chemical World"" also mark Albarn's first forays into the character study songs he'd later become known for. Into theater since his teens, Albarn would occasionally let drop in interviews that his greatest influences were Brecht, Weill, and Artaud's ""theater of cruelty."" <i>Modern Life</i> began to fulfill that promise: Blur were suddenly a band of ideas, though none so pompous that it weighed down the immediacy of their music.</p>
<p><i>Parklife</i> is the masterpiece of this era. Pop-art bright, stingingly funny, and at times suddenly poignant, it remains the defining artifact of Britpop. It's a nationalistic record in the same way <i>Born in the USA</i> is a nationalistic record: It might look like sloganeering patriotism if viewed from outer space, but up close it's a finely detailed, intricately cracked document of a very particular national malaise. The disco smirk ""Girls &amp; Boys"" (propelled by one of Alex James' best basslines) finds its hedonistic vacationers ""avoiding all work, 'cause there's none available,"" while the tragicomic ""Tracy Jacks"" sketches a lonely civil servant who goes quietly mad. With humor, pathos, and nostalgia, <i>Parklife</i> tells of a modern world where dreams have been boxed in by materialism, conformity and routine, and even the once-space-age future has lost its sparkle. ""End of the century,"" Albarn shrugs over Coxon's minor chords. ""It's nothing special.""</p>
<p>The millions-selling, Brit-Award-sweeping <i>Parklife</i> was also the record that made Blur into bona fide pop stars, a role that some members embraced more readily than others. ""I made a point of drinking two bottles of champagne a day for 18 months,"" is how bassist Alex James remembers 1994. ""England only imports something like 100,000 bottles a year, so I reckon I drank 1% of England's total champagne import."" At that point Coxon was, arguably, drinking even more, but without the joie de vivre; instead, he was increasingly uncomfortable with the band's success. <i>The Great Escape</i>, the improbably strong 1995 effort they churned out amidst the squeals of <i>Parklife </i>mania, is fittingly a record of baroque excess (lots of brass) and tension. It's Blur's poppiest album, but it's puffed within an inch of bursting: ""Stereotypes"", ""Charmless Man"", and ""Entertain Me"" are all deceptively dark, stretched like a smile pulled eerily tight. <i>Escape</i>'s crown jewel is the brilliant, Pulp-like single ""The Universal"", an exploration of anhedonia, a state of mind the band knew intimately at this point. Coxon retreated further, and for a moment it looked like he'd leave the band. What happened, though, was just the opposite. He steered them toward their biggest re-invention yet.</p>
<p>""Death of a Party"" (which now sounds like the first proto-Gorillaz Blur song) is the most apt song title on 1997's <i>Blur</i>. Recorded partially in self-imposed exile in Iceland, it is a post-success record, what happens when the odd burdens of mega-fame don't destroy a band but instead sends it diving into uncharted waters. It is 1995's hangover. Exquisitely bleary-eyed (""I'm Just a Killer for Your Love"", the oddball sprawl of ""Essex Dogs"") and often jolting (""M.O.R."", ""Chinese Bombs""), <i>Blur</i> sounds like staying up for six days and then accidentally catching a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. And somehow, amidst the claims of career suicide, it was a huge international hit, the one that finally broke them in the States. (Which is to say that yes, this is the ""Song 2"" album.)</p>
<p>Blur found Pavement in the mid 90s the way Dylan found Jesus in the late 70s: The transfiguration was that complete, that apparent, that difficult for longtime fans to swallow. Coxon had long been evangelizing American indie rock to his bandmates, and, wearied of fame and looking for a new direction, they finally started to listen. To call <i>Blur</i> Coxon's record is a huge simplification (it also marks the height of Albarn's Bowie phase), but it does contain the first song that Coxon wrote and sang on a Blur record, the sweetly wooly ""You're So Great"". Much has been made of the Pavement and Dinosaur Jr. influence on his virtuosic playing, but Coxon has said that the record he was listening to most while making <i>Blur</i> was Big Star's elegiac <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i>. Alex Chilton was an artistic kindred spirit for Coxon. Both had experienced intense, <i>Tiger Beat</i>-cover-style adoration (Chilton had a No. 1 song with the Box Tops before he was 18) and had figured out early on that commercial success wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Chilton, of course, lost his foil too early when Chris Bell left Big Star and died in a car crash not long after. The tension that kept Blur going, in a creatively fertile, decade-long state of about-to-combust, was the push and pull between Coxon and Albarn.</p>
<p>""Graham used to say that he wanted to make an album that nobody would want to listen to,"" says drummer Dave Rowntree in the box's liner notes, ""But you can't do that in a band with Damon."" <i>13</i>, their second masterpiece, finds Albarn and Coxon's opposing sensibilities bleeding into each other like a muddy watercolor. Both were hurting. Coxon was depressed and still at odds with the rest of the band, and Albarn's long relationship with Elastica's Justine Frischmann had just ended. A coping method he'd picked up from blues and DIY alike, Coxon knew how to translate personal pathos into Blur's music. Both the Blur songs on which he sings lead, ""You're So Great"" and <i>13</i>'s ""Coffee and TV"", are candidly about his drinking, and on <i>13</i>, he guided Albarn toward confessional songwriting, too. Albarn had always used character songs to express emotion, but his songs on <i>13</i> strip away the protective covering of wit. ""I hope you're with someone who makes you feel safe in your sleep,"" he croaks on the gorgeous closing lament ""No Distance Left to Run"", while the wounded pop-spiritual ""Tender"" is an obvious career highlight. William Orbit's brilliant, painstaking production pushes Albarn's ever-present pop sensibility to the brink of dissolve. The <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i> comparison feels more apt here: <i>13</i> is a record in a sustained state of elegant unravel, full of the unexpectedly beautiful sounds that pop songs (and people) make while they're falling apart.</p>
<p>As time goes on, <i>13</i> sounds more like a definitive statement, and 2003's <i>Think Tank</i> sounds more like a post-script. Recorded in Morocco after the first Gorillaz record and Coxon's departure (he plays on just one track, the gloomy ""Battery in Your Leg""), it may be the only Blur record that suffers in retrospect. There are some great tracks (""Out of Time"" and ""Sweet Song"") but it doesn't quite pack the punch it did a decade ago. On the other hand, the newest track in the box, the archly grand ""Under the Westway"", feels like a return to form, which is to say it finds the band sounding like it hasn't quite sounded before. In the liner notes, James points to something true, recalling the <i>Think Tank</i> tour: ""It took at least four people to replace what [Coxon] does. Two backing singers, another guitarist, and a lead guitarist. And a percussionist."" Now that the band is-- tentatively, feebly, and contemptuously as ever-- back together, it's even more clear that Blur is the alchemy between these four people.</p>
<p>Like any box set worthy of attention, the sprawl of rarities offers some illuminating gems (an early demo of ""Beetlebum""; the underrated oddball 1992 single ""Popscene""), plenty of cheeky throwaways (a Seymour-era cover of ""Maggie May""; an orchestral pop snippet called ""Sir Elton John's Cock""), and, of course, omissions for never-satisfied diehards to whine about (mine include the original, <i>Leisure</i>-era recording of ""1992"" and the mid-tempo demo of ""Song 2""). The box also contains DVDs of two complete live performances, which tell two very different tales. The first is a show at Alexandra Palace in North London from October 1994. Blur are at the height of their first wave of fame, and the young audience is whipped into such a frenzy that they even sing along with the melody of the instrumental filler ""Lot 105"", as if they just need something to scream; the band gets off on it. Five years later, they are at Wembley Arena playing all 20 of their singles in chronological order. They look as weary as second-term presidents as they slog through the motions for the first three-quarters of the setlist, but at ""Tender"" everything shifts. Suddenly, they embody the material, coming achingly alive again, reborn on the stage.</p>
<p>If you need a through-line, try the story that those selected bookends tell: Blur are a triumph of feeling. They spent the first half of their career creating modern characters who'd become fashionably distanced from their own emotions and the next half actually, unfashionably, emoting. But that's just one straight line you could draw; why should you have to choose? Modern life is full of champagne and hangovers.

Both had experienced intense, <i>Tiger Beat</i>-cover-style adoration (Chilton had a No. 1 song with the Box Tops before he was 18) and had figured out early on that commercial success wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Chilton, of course, lost his foil too early when Chris Bell left Big Star and died in a car crash not long after. The tension that kept Blur going, in a creatively fertile, decade-long state of about-to-combust, was the push and pull between Coxon and Albarn.</p>
<p>""Graham used to say that he wanted to make an album that nobody would want to listen to,"" says drummer Dave Rowntree in the box's liner notes, ""But you can't do that in a band with Damon."" <i>13</i>, their second masterpiece, finds Albarn and Coxon's opposing sensibilities bleeding into each other like a muddy watercolor. Both were hurting. Coxon was depressed and still at odds with the rest of the band, and Albarn's long relationship with Elastica's Justine Frischmann had just ended. A coping method he'd picked up from blues and DIY alike, Coxon knew how to translate personal pathos into Blur's music. Both the Blur songs on which he sings lead, ""You're So Great"" and <i>13</i>'s ""Coffee and TV"", are candidly about his drinking, and on <i>13</i>, he guided Albarn toward confessional songwriting, too. Albarn had always used character songs to express emotion, but his songs on <i>13</i> strip away the protective covering of wit. ""I hope you're with someone who makes you feel safe in your sleep,"" he croaks on the gorgeous closing lament ""No Distance Left to Run"", while the wounded pop-spiritual ""Tender"" is an obvious career highlight. William Orbit's brilliant, painstaking production pushes Albarn's ever-present pop sensibility to the brink of dissolve. The <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i> comparison feels more apt here: <i>13</i> is a record in a sustained state of elegant unravel, full of the unexpectedly beautiful sounds that pop songs (and people) make while they're falling apart.</p>
<p>As time goes on, <i>13</i> sounds more like a definitive statement, and 2003's <i>Think Tank</i> sounds more like a post-script. Recorded in Morocco after the first Gorillaz record and Coxon's departure (he plays on just one track, the gloomy ""Battery in Your Leg""), it may be the only Blur record that suffers in retrospect. There are some great tracks (""Out of Time"" and ""Sweet Song"") but it doesn't quite pack the punch it did a decade ago. On the other hand, the newest track in the box, the archly grand ""Under the Westway"", feels like a return to form, which is to say it finds the band sounding like it hasn't quite sounded before. In the liner notes, James points to something true, recalling the <i>Think Tank</i> tour: ""It took at least four people to replace what [Coxon] does. Two backing singers, another guitarist, and a lead guitarist. And a percussionist."" Now that the band is-- tentatively, feebly, and contemptuously as ever-- back together, it's even more clear that Blur is the alchemy between these four people.</p>
<p>Like any box set worthy of attention, the sprawl of rarities offers some illuminating gems (an early demo of ""Beetlebum""; the underrated oddball 1992 single ""Popscene""), plenty of cheeky throwaways (a Seymour-era cover of ""Maggie May""; an orchestral pop snippet called ""Sir Elton John's Cock""), and, of course, omissions for never-satisfied diehards to whine about (mine include the original, <i>Leisure</i>-era recording of ""1992"" and the mid-tempo demo of ""Song 2""). The box also contains DVDs of two complete live performances, which tell two very different tales. The first is a show at Alexandra Palace in North London from October 1994. Blur are at the height of their first wave of fame, and the young audience is whipped into such a frenzy that they even sing along with the melody of the instrumental filler ""Lot 105"", as if they just need something to scream; the band gets off on it. Five years later, they are at Wembley Arena playing all 20 of their singles in chronological order. They look as weary as second-term presidents as they slog through the motions for the first three-quarters of the setlist, but at ""Tender"" everything shifts. Suddenly, they embody the material, coming achingly alive again, reborn on the stage.</p>
<p>If you need a through-line, try the story that those selected bookends tell: Blur are a triumph of feeling. They spent the first half of their career creating modern characters who'd become fashionably distanced from their own emotions and the next half actually, unfashionably, emoting. But that's just one straight line you could draw; why should you have to choose? Modern life is full of champagne and hangovers. So is Blur.</p></div>"|16877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16877-blur-21/|9.5|Lindsay Zoladz

Choose Ray Davies, choose Stephen Malkmus; choose la-la-la or wooo-hoo. (And before you answer this next one know that the Queen is watching.) Choose Britain. Choose America.</p>
<p>Or, you know, don't choose. Blur have been a band for 21 years, and their story is long enough to speak a bunch of contradictions. That's what happens to bands that house four egos and a pair of dueling geniuses. They rarely move in straight lines. One example of many: Blur arrived in New York for the first time on the day <i>Nevermind</i> was released. When asked on radio what they thought of the new Seattle sound, Graham Coxon said, ""I fucking hate it."" Later he'd be the one to lead the band toward a post-grunge, indie-tinged sound, a nugget of which will be blared alongside ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" at sports arenas until the end of time. Another? In 1994, Damon Albarn wrote a snide little number about the cultural allure of the West (sneeringly: ""La-la-la-la-la/ He'd like to live in Magic America/ With all the magic people""). Three years on, he was a bit more forgiving (one more time, with earnestness: ""Look inside America/ She's alright/ She's alright""). It's not <i>despite</i> but <i>because</i> of these pivots and complexities that it feels appropriate to call Blur a defining band of the past two decades.</p>
<p>Up until now, listeners have been urged to take one of two positions: 1) ""Great pop band, until they went to America and sold out!""; or 2) ""The early stuff is too British, but I love all that weird shit they did later on."" There was a sense that you couldn't love it all-- the witty, theatrical, Kinks-inspired character sketches perfected on 1994's <i>Parklife</i> <i>and</i> the impressionistic elegies of their 1999 sad-bastard masterstroke, <i>13</i>. And the choice was loaded. Think I'm exaggerating? Just read some of the reviews of their last two greatest-hits collections, 2000's <i>Best of Blur</i> and 2009's <i>Midlife</i>, both of which favored their later stuff. ""Let Blur bash their way on towards the margins,"" Steve Sutherland <a href=""http://www.vblurpage.com/articles/albums/bestof_nme.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a> defensively in a 2000 issue of <i>NME</i>. ""Just because these [early] songs embarrassed them once they started listening to broadsheet critics and retreated wounded from the big-sales battle with Oasis doesn't mean that we're morons to love them."" Nine years later, Scott Plagenhoef observed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13168-midlife-a-beginners-guide-to-blur/"">on this site</a>, ""Few bands from the 90s increased their stature this decade among America's self-identifying indie set as much as Blur."" <i>Midlife</i>, he said, ""can be seen as a more Americentric look at Blur's career, which makes some sense as they still have a lot of fanbase growth potential in the States.""</p>
<p>Three years after <i>Midlife</i>-- and with the whole world turned to their second reunion at the London Olympics closing ceremony-- it's time for a truce. So here it is, <i>Blur 21</i>, the inevitable box set comprising all seven albums, three DVDs, and five-and-a-half hours' worth of rarities. And even if you can't afford the thing on vinyl, its very existence presents us with the perfect opportunity to rethink the band's history. Because for its breadth and complexity, the box actually tells a simple story: Blur are a band that did an astonishing amount of different things really, really well.</p>
<p>Be patient, though, because we're going to start at the beginning, and their 1991 debut, <i>Leisure</i>, is not very good. It shows a melodic gift and hints at the Syd Barrett obsession that would plant seeds for future experimentation (""Sing""). But mostly, it's the work of a band still searching for its identity. Prior to signing with the London label Food Ltd., Blur were known as Seymour, a madcap art-punk four-piece that generated a mild buzz in late-80s London with their boozy, chaotic live shows. That anarchic energy is all but absent from <i>Leisure, </i>though it's captured on the box's first disc of rarities, including early Seymour demos and a 7"" containing the endearingly awkward baby picture ""Superman"".</p>
<p>When <i>Leisure</i> came out, baggy was all the rage in the UK. The label's intention was to turn Blur into the next Stone Roses-- or better yet, the even better-selling Food signees Jesus Jones. They wanted Blur's first single to be the baggy-by-numbers ""I Know"" but, in the first of many well documented band-vs.-label throw-downs, the band fought for the shoegazey ""She's So High"". Blur won, and 21 years later, this art-over-commerce victory feels prophetic, even if the song doesn't. ""High"" is still a better track than ""I Know"", but it has a kind of time-stamped anonymity that pervades even the best moments of <i>Leisure</i>: pretty, vacant, and vague.</p>
<p>1992 would light a fire under Blur, kindled by a few factors: a bad management contract that left them in significant debt; critical and commercial disappointment; intra-band conflict (a flame that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46622-producer-damon-albarn-halts-work-on-new-blur-album-to-the-surprise-of-the-rest-of-the-band/"">never stopped burning</a>); and, above all, grunge. Blur toured North America for the second time that year. And just a year into the post-<i>Nevermind</i> world, flannel, disaffectedly mumbled lyrics, and buzzsaw guitars were the new normal. ""Nothing in England counted and that really pissed us off,"" Albarn recalled in 1999. ""So we decided to make a record as English as possible; a record full of English references and English cultural icons."" Therein lies the irony of their breakthrough 1993 album, <i>Modern Life Is Rubbish</i>. Though it wouldn't hit big in America, it was conceived with the same spirit of roguish overthrow as <i>Nevermind</i> itself. Albarn's newfound articulateness was, actually, an act of punk rebellion, a sneering rejection of the status quo.</p>
<p>The artistic leap between <i>Leisure</i> and <i>Modern Life Is Rubbish</i> is roughly the same size as the one between <i>Pablo Honey</i> and <i>The Bends</i>: unpredictably huge. It's a statement record in title, sound, and content. What else can be said of an album that begins with a once-upon-a-time as dramatic as, ""He's a 20th-century boy..."" and draws upon an lineage of English guitar pop ranging from the Kinks to the Who to T. Rex? Blur would improve on these ideas on their next few records, but <i>Modern Life</i> remains a finely observed, tartly disillusioned snapshot of post-Thatcher Britain, buoyed by exquisite pop hooks. ""Colin Zeal"" and ""Chemical World"" also mark Albarn's first forays into the character study songs he'd later become known for. Into theater since his teens, Albarn would occasionally let drop in interviews that his greatest influences were Brecht, Weill, and Artaud's ""theater of cruelty."" <i>Modern Life</i> began to fulfill that promise: Blur were suddenly a band of ideas, though none so pompous that it weighed down the immediacy of their music.</p>
<p><i>Parklife</i> is the masterpiece of this era. Pop-art bright, stingingly funny, and at times suddenly poignant, it remains the defining artifact of Britpop. It's a nationalistic record in the same way <i>Born in the USA</i> is a nationalistic record: It might look like sloganeering patriotism if viewed from outer space, but up close it's a finely detailed, intricately cracked document of a very particular national malaise. The disco smirk ""Girls &amp; Boys"" (propelled by one of Alex James' best basslines) finds its hedonistic vacationers ""avoiding all work, 'cause there's none available,"" while the tragicomic ""Tracy Jacks"" sketches a lonely civil servant who goes quietly mad. With humor, pathos, and nostalgia, <i>Parklife</i> tells of a modern world where dreams have been boxed in by materialism, conformity and routine, and even the once-space-age future has lost its sparkle. ""End of the century,"" Albarn shrugs over Coxon's minor chords. ""It's nothing special.""</p>
<p>The millions-selling, Brit-Award-sweeping <i>Parklife</i> was also the record that made Blur into bona fide pop stars, a role that some members embraced more readily than others. ""I made a point of drinking two bottles of champagne a day for 18 months,"" is how bassist Alex James remembers 1994. ""England only imports something like 100,000 bottles a year, so I reckon I drank 1% of England's total champagne import."" At that point Coxon was, arguably, drinking even more, but without the joie de vivre; instead, he was increasingly uncomfortable with the band's success. <i>The Great Escape</i>, the improbably strong 1995 effort they churned out amidst the squeals of <i>Parklife </i>mania, is fittingly a record of baroque excess (lots of brass) and tension. It's Blur's poppiest album, but it's puffed within an inch of bursting: ""Stereotypes"", ""Charmless Man"", and ""Entertain Me"" are all deceptively dark, stretched like a smile pulled eerily tight. <i>Escape</i>'s crown jewel is the brilliant, Pulp-like single ""The Universal"", an exploration of anhedonia, a state of mind the band knew intimately at this point. Coxon retreated further, and for a moment it looked like he'd leave the band. What happened, though, was just the opposite. He steered them toward their biggest re-invention yet.</p>
<p>""Death of a Party"" (which now sounds like the first proto-Gorillaz Blur song) is the most apt song title on 1997's <i>Blur</i>. Recorded partially in self-imposed exile in Iceland, it is a post-success record, what happens when the odd burdens of mega-fame don't destroy a band but instead sends it diving into uncharted waters. It is 1995's hangover. Exquisitely bleary-eyed (""I'm Just a Killer for Your Love"", the oddball sprawl of ""Essex Dogs"") and often jolting (""M.O.R."", ""Chinese Bombs""), <i>Blur</i> sounds like staying up for six days and then accidentally catching a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. And somehow, amidst the claims of career suicide, it was a huge international hit, the one that finally broke them in the States. (Which is to say that yes, this is the ""Song 2"" album.)</p>
<p>Blur found Pavement in the mid 90s the way Dylan found Jesus in the late 70s: The transfiguration was that complete, that apparent, that difficult for longtime fans to swallow. Coxon had long been evangelizing American indie rock to his bandmates, and, wearied of fame and looking for a new direction, they finally started to listen. To call <i>Blur</i> Coxon's record is a huge simplification (it also marks the height of Albarn's Bowie phase), but it does contain the first song that Coxon wrote and sang on a Blur record, the sweetly wooly ""You're So Great"". Much has been made of the Pavement and Dinosaur Jr. influence on his virtuosic playing, but Coxon has said that the record he was listening to most while making <i>Blur</i> was Big Star's elegiac <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i>. Alex Chilton was an artistic kindred spirit for Coxon. Both had experienced intense, <i>Tiger Beat</i>-cover-style adoration (Chilton had a No. 1 song with the Box Tops before he was 18) and had figured out early on that commercial success wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Chilton, of course, lost his foil too early when Chris Bell left Big Star and died in a car crash not long after. The tension that kept Blur going, in a creatively fertile, decade-long state of about-to-combust, was the push and pull between Coxon and Albarn.</p>
<p>""Graham used to say that he wanted to make an album that nobody would want to listen to,"" says drummer Dave Rowntree in the box's liner notes, ""But you can't do that in a band with Damon."" <i>13</i>, their second masterpiece, finds Albarn and Coxon's opposing sensibilities bleeding into each other like a muddy watercolor. Both were hurting. Coxon was depressed and still at odds with the rest of the band, and Albarn's long relationship with Elastica's Justine Frischmann had just ended. A coping method he'd picked up from blues and DIY alike, Coxon knew how to translate personal pathos into Blur's music. Both the Blur songs on which he sings lead, ""You're So Great"" and <i>13</i>'s ""Coffee and TV"", are candidly about his drinking, and on <i>13</i>, he guided Albarn toward confessional songwriting, too.

Into theater since his teens, Albarn would occasionally let drop in interviews that his greatest influences were Brecht, Weill, and Artaud's ""theater of cruelty."" <i>Modern Life</i> began to fulfill that promise: Blur were suddenly a band of ideas, though none so pompous that it weighed down the immediacy of their music.</p>
<p><i>Parklife</i> is the masterpiece of this era. Pop-art bright, stingingly funny, and at times suddenly poignant, it remains the defining artifact of Britpop. It's a nationalistic record in the same way <i>Born in the USA</i> is a nationalistic record: It might look like sloganeering patriotism if viewed from outer space, but up close it's a finely detailed, intricately cracked document of a very particular national malaise. The disco smirk ""Girls &amp; Boys"" (propelled by one of Alex James' best basslines) finds its hedonistic vacationers ""avoiding all work, 'cause there's none available,"" while the tragicomic ""Tracy Jacks"" sketches a lonely civil servant who goes quietly mad. With humor, pathos, and nostalgia, <i>Parklife</i> tells of a modern world where dreams have been boxed in by materialism, conformity and routine, and even the once-space-age future has lost its sparkle. ""End of the century,"" Albarn shrugs over Coxon's minor chords. ""It's nothing special.""</p>
<p>The millions-selling, Brit-Award-sweeping <i>Parklife</i> was also the record that made Blur into bona fide pop stars, a role that some members embraced more readily than others. ""I made a point of drinking two bottles of champagne a day for 18 months,"" is how bassist Alex James remembers 1994. ""England only imports something like 100,000 bottles a year, so I reckon I drank 1% of England's total champagne import."" At that point Coxon was, arguably, drinking even more, but without the joie de vivre; instead, he was increasingly uncomfortable with the band's success. <i>The Great Escape</i>, the improbably strong 1995 effort they churned out amidst the squeals of <i>Parklife </i>mania, is fittingly a record of baroque excess (lots of brass) and tension. It's Blur's poppiest album, but it's puffed within an inch of bursting: ""Stereotypes"", ""Charmless Man"", and ""Entertain Me"" are all deceptively dark, stretched like a smile pulled eerily tight. <i>Escape</i>'s crown jewel is the brilliant, Pulp-like single ""The Universal"", an exploration of anhedonia, a state of mind the band knew intimately at this point. Coxon retreated further, and for a moment it looked like he'd leave the band. What happened, though, was just the opposite. He steered them toward their biggest re-invention yet.</p>
<p>""Death of a Party"" (which now sounds like the first proto-Gorillaz Blur song) is the most apt song title on 1997's <i>Blur</i>. Recorded partially in self-imposed exile in Iceland, it is a post-success record, what happens when the odd burdens of mega-fame don't destroy a band but instead sends it diving into uncharted waters. It is 1995's hangover. Exquisitely bleary-eyed (""I'm Just a Killer for Your Love"", the oddball sprawl of ""Essex Dogs"") and often jolting (""M.O.R."", ""Chinese Bombs""), <i>Blur</i> sounds like staying up for six days and then accidentally catching a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. And somehow, amidst the claims of career suicide, it was a huge international hit, the one that finally broke them in the States. (Which is to say that yes, this is the ""Song 2"" album.)</p>
<p>Blur found Pavement in the mid 90s the way Dylan found Jesus in the late 70s: The transfiguration was that complete, that apparent, that difficult for longtime fans to swallow. Coxon had long been evangelizing American indie rock to his bandmates, and, wearied of fame and looking for a new direction, they finally started to listen. To call <i>Blur</i> Coxon's record is a huge simplification (it also marks the height of Albarn's Bowie phase), but it does contain the first song that Coxon wrote and sang on a Blur record, the sweetly wooly ""You're So Great"". Much has been made of the Pavement and Dinosaur Jr. influence on his virtuosic playing, but Coxon has said that the record he was listening to most while making <i>Blur</i> was Big Star's elegiac <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i>. Alex Chilton was an artistic kindred spirit for Coxon. Both had experienced intense, <i>Tiger Beat</i>-cover-style adoration (Chilton had a No. 1 song with the Box Tops before he was 18) and had figured out early on that commercial success wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Chilton, of course, lost his foil too early when Chris Bell left Big Star and died in a car crash not long after. The tension that kept Blur going, in a creatively fertile, decade-long state of about-to-combust, was the push and pull between Coxon and Albarn.</p>
<p>""Graham used to say that he wanted to make an album that nobody would want to listen to,"" says drummer Dave Rowntree in the box's liner notes, ""But you can't do that in a band with Damon."" <i>13</i>, their second masterpiece, finds Albarn and Coxon's opposing sensibilities bleeding into each other like a muddy watercolor. Both were hurting. Coxon was depressed and still at odds with the rest of the band, and Albarn's long relationship with Elastica's Justine Frischmann had just ended. A coping method he'd picked up from blues and DIY alike, Coxon knew how to translate personal pathos into Blur's music. Both the Blur songs on which he sings lead, ""You're So Great"" and <i>13</i>'s ""Coffee and TV"", are candidly about his drinking, and on <i>13</i>, he guided Albarn toward confessional songwriting, too. Albarn had always used character songs to express emotion, but his songs on <i>13</i> strip away the protective covering of wit. ""I hope you're with someone who makes you feel safe in your sleep,"" he croaks on the gorgeous closing lament ""No Distance Left to Run"", while the wounded pop-spiritual ""Tender"" is an obvious career highlight. William Orbit's brilliant, painstaking production pushes Albarn's ever-present pop sensibility to the brink of dissolve. The <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i> comparison feels more apt here: <i>13</i> is a record in a sustained state of elegant unravel, full of the unexpectedly beautiful sounds that pop songs (and people) make while they're falling apart.</p>
<p>As time goes on, <i>13</i> sounds more like a definitive statement, and 2003's <i>Think Tank</i> sounds more like a post-script. Recorded in Morocco after the first Gorillaz record and Coxon's departure (he plays on just one track, the gloomy ""Battery in Your Leg""), it may be the only Blur record that suffers in retrospect. There are some great tracks (""Out of Time"" and ""Sweet Song"") but it doesn't quite pack the punch it did a decade ago. On the other hand, the newest track in the box, the archly grand ""Under the Westway"", feels like a return to form, which is to say it finds the band sounding like it hasn't quite sounded before. In the liner notes, James points to something true, recalling the <i>Think Tank</i> tour: ""It took at least four people to replace what [Coxon] does. Two backing singers, another guitarist, and a lead guitarist. And a percussionist."" Now that the band is-- tentatively, feebly, and contemptuously as ever-- back together, it's even more clear that Blur is the alchemy between these four people.</p>
<p>Like any box set worthy of attention, the sprawl of rarities offers some illuminating gems (an early demo of ""Beetlebum""; the underrated oddball 1992 single ""Popscene""), plenty of cheeky throwaways (a Seymour-era cover of ""Maggie May""; an orchestral pop snippet called ""Sir Elton John's Cock""), and, of course, omissions for never-satisfied diehards to whine about (mine include the original, <i>Leisure</i>-era recording of ""1992"" and the mid-tempo demo of ""Song 2""). The box also contains DVDs of two complete live performances, which tell two very different tales. The first is a show at Alexandra Palace in North London from October 1994. Blur are at the height of their first wave of fame, and the young audience is whipped into such a frenzy that they even sing along with the melody of the instrumental filler ""Lot 105"", as if they just need something to scream; the band gets off on it. Five years later, they are at Wembley Arena playing all 20 of their singles in chronological order. They look as weary as second-term presidents as they slog through the motions for the first three-quarters of the setlist, but at ""Tender"" everything shifts. Suddenly, they embody the material, coming achingly alive again, reborn on the stage.</p>
<p>If you need a through-line, try the story that those selected bookends tell: Blur are a triumph of feeling. They spent the first half of their career creating modern characters who'd become fashionably distanced from their own emotions and the next half actually, unfashionably, emoting. But that's just one straight line you could draw; why should you have to choose? Modern life is full of champagne and hangovers. So is Blur.</p></div>"|16877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16877-blur-21/|8.1|Lindsay Zoladz

Choose Ray Davies, choose Stephen Malkmus; choose la-la-la or wooo-hoo. (And before you answer this next one know that the Queen is watching.) Choose Britain. Choose America.</p>
<p>Or, you know, don't choose. Blur have been a band for 21 years, and their story is long enough to speak a bunch of contradictions. That's what happens to bands that house four egos and a pair of dueling geniuses. They rarely move in straight lines. One example of many: Blur arrived in New York for the first time on the day <i>Nevermind</i> was released. When asked on radio what they thought of the new Seattle sound, Graham Coxon said, ""I fucking hate it."" Later he'd be the one to lead the band toward a post-grunge, indie-tinged sound, a nugget of which will be blared alongside ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" at sports arenas until the end of time. Another? In 1994, Damon Albarn wrote a snide little number about the cultural allure of the West (sneeringly: ""La-la-la-la-la/ He'd like to live in Magic America/ With all the magic people""). Three years on, he was a bit more forgiving (one more time, with earnestness: ""Look inside America/ She's alright/ She's alright""). It's not <i>despite</i> but <i>because</i> of these pivots and complexities that it feels appropriate to call Blur a defining band of the past two decades.</p>
<p>Up until now, listeners have been urged to take one of two positions: 1) ""Great pop band, until they went to America and sold out!""; or 2) ""The early stuff is too British, but I love all that weird shit they did later on."" There was a sense that you couldn't love it all-- the witty, theatrical, Kinks-inspired character sketches perfected on 1994's <i>Parklife</i> <i>and</i> the impressionistic elegies of their 1999 sad-bastard masterstroke, <i>13</i>. And the choice was loaded. Think I'm exaggerating? Just read some of the reviews of their last two greatest-hits collections, 2000's <i>Best of Blur</i> and 2009's <i>Midlife</i>, both of which favored their later stuff. ""Let Blur bash their way on towards the margins,"" Steve Sutherland <a href=""http://www.vblurpage.com/articles/albums/bestof_nme.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a> defensively in a 2000 issue of <i>NME</i>. ""Just because these [early] songs embarrassed them once they started listening to broadsheet critics and retreated wounded from the big-sales battle with Oasis doesn't mean that we're morons to love them."" Nine years later, Scott Plagenhoef observed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13168-midlife-a-beginners-guide-to-blur/"">on this site</a>, ""Few bands from the 90s increased their stature this decade among America's self-identifying indie set as much as Blur."" <i>Midlife</i>, he said, ""can be seen as a more Americentric look at Blur's career, which makes some sense as they still have a lot of fanbase growth potential in the States.""</p>
<p>Three years after <i>Midlife</i>-- and with the whole world turned to their second reunion at the London Olympics closing ceremony-- it's time for a truce. So here it is, <i>Blur 21</i>, the inevitable box set comprising all seven albums, three DVDs, and five-and-a-half hours' worth of rarities. And even if you can't afford the thing on vinyl, its very existence presents us with the perfect opportunity to rethink the band's history. Because for its breadth and complexity, the box actually tells a simple story: Blur are a band that did an astonishing amount of different things really, really well.</p>
<p>Be patient, though, because we're going to start at the beginning, and their 1991 debut, <i>Leisure</i>, is not very good. It shows a melodic gift and hints at the Syd Barrett obsession that would plant seeds for future experimentation (""Sing""). But mostly, it's the work of a band still searching for its identity. Prior to signing with the London label Food Ltd., Blur were known as Seymour, a madcap art-punk four-piece that generated a mild buzz in late-80s London with their boozy, chaotic live shows. That anarchic energy is all but absent from <i>Leisure, </i>though it's captured on the box's first disc of rarities, including early Seymour demos and a 7"" containing the endearingly awkward baby picture ""Superman"".</p>
<p>When <i>Leisure</i> came out, baggy was all the rage in the UK. The label's intention was to turn Blur into the next Stone Roses-- or better yet, the even better-selling Food signees Jesus Jones. They wanted Blur's first single to be the baggy-by-numbers ""I Know"" but, in the first of many well documented band-vs.-label throw-downs, the band fought for the shoegazey ""She's So High"". Blur won, and 21 years later, this art-over-commerce victory feels prophetic, even if the song doesn't. ""High"" is still a better track than ""I Know"", but it has a kind of time-stamped anonymity that pervades even the best moments of <i>Leisure</i>: pretty, vacant, and vague.</p>
<p>1992 would light a fire under Blur, kindled by a few factors: a bad management contract that left them in significant debt; critical and commercial disappointment; intra-band conflict (a flame that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46622-producer-damon-albarn-halts-work-on-new-blur-album-to-the-surprise-of-the-rest-of-the-band/"">never stopped burning</a>); and, above all, grunge. Blur toured North America for the second time that year. And just a year into the post-<i>Nevermind</i> world, flannel, disaffectedly mumbled lyrics, and buzzsaw guitars were the new normal. ""Nothing in England counted and that really pissed us off,"" Albarn recalled in 1999. ""So we decided to make a record as English as possible; a record full of English references and English cultural icons."" Therein lies the irony of their breakthrough 1993 album, <i>Modern Life Is Rubbish</i>. Though it wouldn't hit big in America, it was conceived with the same spirit of roguish overthrow as <i>Nevermind</i> itself. Albarn's newfound articulateness was, actually, an act of punk rebellion, a sneering rejection of the status quo.</p>
<p>The artistic leap between <i>Leisure</i> and <i>Modern Life Is Rubbish</i> is roughly the same size as the one between <i>Pablo Honey</i> and <i>The Bends</i>: unpredictably huge. It's a statement record in title, sound, and content. What else can be said of an album that begins with a once-upon-a-time as dramatic as, ""He's a 20th-century boy..."" and draws upon an lineage of English guitar pop ranging from the Kinks to the Who to T. Rex? Blur would improve on these ideas on their next few records, but <i>Modern Life</i> remains a finely observed, tartly disillusioned snapshot of post-Thatcher Britain, buoyed by exquisite pop hooks. ""Colin Zeal"" and ""Chemical World"" also mark Albarn's first forays into the character study songs he'd later become known for. Into theater since his teens, Albarn would occasionally let drop in interviews that his greatest influences were Brecht, Weill, and Artaud's ""theater of cruelty."" <i>Modern Life</i> began to fulfill that promise: Blur were suddenly a band of ideas, though none so pompous that it weighed down the immediacy of their music.</p>
<p><i>Parklife</i> is the masterpiece of this era. Pop-art bright, stingingly funny, and at times suddenly poignant, it remains the defining artifact of Britpop. It's a nationalistic record in the same way <i>Born in the USA</i> is a nationalistic record: It might look like sloganeering patriotism if viewed from outer space, but up close it's a finely detailed, intricately cracked document of a very particular national malaise. The disco smirk ""Girls &amp; Boys"" (propelled by one of Alex James' best basslines) finds its hedonistic vacationers ""avoiding all work, 'cause there's none available,"" while the tragicomic ""Tracy Jacks"" sketches a lonely civil servant who goes quietly mad. With humor, pathos, and nostalgia, <i>Parklife</i> tells of a modern world where dreams have been boxed in by materialism, conformity and routine, and even the once-space-age future has lost its sparkle. ""End of the century,"" Albarn shrugs over Coxon's minor chords. ""It's nothing special.""</p>
<p>The millions-selling, Brit-Award-sweeping <i>Parklife</i> was also the record that made Blur into bona fide pop stars, a role that some members embraced more readily than others. ""I made a point of drinking two bottles of champagne a day for 18 months,"" is how bassist Alex James remembers 1994.

Nine years later, Scott Plagenhoef observed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13168-midlife-a-beginners-guide-to-blur/"">on this site</a>, ""Few bands from the 90s increased their stature this decade among America's self-identifying indie set as much as Blur."" <i>Midlife</i>, he said, ""can be seen as a more Americentric look at Blur's career, which makes some sense as they still have a lot of fanbase growth potential in the States.""</p>
<p>Three years after <i>Midlife</i>-- and with the whole world turned to their second reunion at the London Olympics closing ceremony-- it's time for a truce. So here it is, <i>Blur 21</i>, the inevitable box set comprising all seven albums, three DVDs, and five-and-a-half hours' worth of rarities. And even if you can't afford the thing on vinyl, its very existence presents us with the perfect opportunity to rethink the band's history. Because for its breadth and complexity, the box actually tells a simple story: Blur are a band that did an astonishing amount of different things really, really well.</p>
<p>Be patient, though, because we're going to start at the beginning, and their 1991 debut, <i>Leisure</i>, is not very good. It shows a melodic gift and hints at the Syd Barrett obsession that would plant seeds for future experimentation (""Sing""). But mostly, it's the work of a band still searching for its identity. Prior to signing with the London label Food Ltd., Blur were known as Seymour, a madcap art-punk four-piece that generated a mild buzz in late-80s London with their boozy, chaotic live shows. That anarchic energy is all but absent from <i>Leisure, </i>though it's captured on the box's first disc of rarities, including early Seymour demos and a 7"" containing the endearingly awkward baby picture ""Superman"".</p>
<p>When <i>Leisure</i> came out, baggy was all the rage in the UK. The label's intention was to turn Blur into the next Stone Roses-- or better yet, the even better-selling Food signees Jesus Jones. They wanted Blur's first single to be the baggy-by-numbers ""I Know"" but, in the first of many well documented band-vs.-label throw-downs, the band fought for the shoegazey ""She's So High"". Blur won, and 21 years later, this art-over-commerce victory feels prophetic, even if the song doesn't. ""High"" is still a better track than ""I Know"", but it has a kind of time-stamped anonymity that pervades even the best moments of <i>Leisure</i>: pretty, vacant, and vague.</p>
<p>1992 would light a fire under Blur, kindled by a few factors: a bad management contract that left them in significant debt; critical and commercial disappointment; intra-band conflict (a flame that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46622-producer-damon-albarn-halts-work-on-new-blur-album-to-the-surprise-of-the-rest-of-the-band/"">never stopped burning</a>); and, above all, grunge. Blur toured North America for the second time that year. And just a year into the post-<i>Nevermind</i> world, flannel, disaffectedly mumbled lyrics, and buzzsaw guitars were the new normal. ""Nothing in England counted and that really pissed us off,"" Albarn recalled in 1999. ""So we decided to make a record as English as possible; a record full of English references and English cultural icons."" Therein lies the irony of their breakthrough 1993 album, <i>Modern Life Is Rubbish</i>. Though it wouldn't hit big in America, it was conceived with the same spirit of roguish overthrow as <i>Nevermind</i> itself. Albarn's newfound articulateness was, actually, an act of punk rebellion, a sneering rejection of the status quo.</p>
<p>The artistic leap between <i>Leisure</i> and <i>Modern Life Is Rubbish</i> is roughly the same size as the one between <i>Pablo Honey</i> and <i>The Bends</i>: unpredictably huge. It's a statement record in title, sound, and content. What else can be said of an album that begins with a once-upon-a-time as dramatic as, ""He's a 20th-century boy..."" and draws upon an lineage of English guitar pop ranging from the Kinks to the Who to T. Rex? Blur would improve on these ideas on their next few records, but <i>Modern Life</i> remains a finely observed, tartly disillusioned snapshot of post-Thatcher Britain, buoyed by exquisite pop hooks. ""Colin Zeal"" and ""Chemical World"" also mark Albarn's first forays into the character study songs he'd later become known for. Into theater since his teens, Albarn would occasionally let drop in interviews that his greatest influences were Brecht, Weill, and Artaud's ""theater of cruelty."" <i>Modern Life</i> began to fulfill that promise: Blur were suddenly a band of ideas, though none so pompous that it weighed down the immediacy of their music.</p>
<p><i>Parklife</i> is the masterpiece of this era. Pop-art bright, stingingly funny, and at times suddenly poignant, it remains the defining artifact of Britpop. It's a nationalistic record in the same way <i>Born in the USA</i> is a nationalistic record: It might look like sloganeering patriotism if viewed from outer space, but up close it's a finely detailed, intricately cracked document of a very particular national malaise. The disco smirk ""Girls &amp; Boys"" (propelled by one of Alex James' best basslines) finds its hedonistic vacationers ""avoiding all work, 'cause there's none available,"" while the tragicomic ""Tracy Jacks"" sketches a lonely civil servant who goes quietly mad. With humor, pathos, and nostalgia, <i>Parklife</i> tells of a modern world where dreams have been boxed in by materialism, conformity and routine, and even the once-space-age future has lost its sparkle. ""End of the century,"" Albarn shrugs over Coxon's minor chords. ""It's nothing special.""</p>
<p>The millions-selling, Brit-Award-sweeping <i>Parklife</i> was also the record that made Blur into bona fide pop stars, a role that some members embraced more readily than others. ""I made a point of drinking two bottles of champagne a day for 18 months,"" is how bassist Alex James remembers 1994. ""England only imports something like 100,000 bottles a year, so I reckon I drank 1% of England's total champagne import."" At that point Coxon was, arguably, drinking even more, but without the joie de vivre; instead, he was increasingly uncomfortable with the band's success. <i>The Great Escape</i>, the improbably strong 1995 effort they churned out amidst the squeals of <i>Parklife </i>mania, is fittingly a record of baroque excess (lots of brass) and tension. It's Blur's poppiest album, but it's puffed within an inch of bursting: ""Stereotypes"", ""Charmless Man"", and ""Entertain Me"" are all deceptively dark, stretched like a smile pulled eerily tight. <i>Escape</i>'s crown jewel is the brilliant, Pulp-like single ""The Universal"", an exploration of anhedonia, a state of mind the band knew intimately at this point. Coxon retreated further, and for a moment it looked like he'd leave the band. What happened, though, was just the opposite. He steered them toward their biggest re-invention yet.</p>
<p>""Death of a Party"" (which now sounds like the first proto-Gorillaz Blur song) is the most apt song title on 1997's <i>Blur</i>. Recorded partially in self-imposed exile in Iceland, it is a post-success record, what happens when the odd burdens of mega-fame don't destroy a band but instead sends it diving into uncharted waters. It is 1995's hangover. Exquisitely bleary-eyed (""I'm Just a Killer for Your Love"", the oddball sprawl of ""Essex Dogs"") and often jolting (""M.O.R."", ""Chinese Bombs""), <i>Blur</i> sounds like staying up for six days and then accidentally catching a glimpse of yourself in the mirror. And somehow, amidst the claims of career suicide, it was a huge international hit, the one that finally broke them in the States. (Which is to say that yes, this is the ""Song 2"" album.)</p>
<p>Blur found Pavement in the mid 90s the way Dylan found Jesus in the late 70s: The transfiguration was that complete, that apparent, that difficult for longtime fans to swallow. Coxon had long been evangelizing American indie rock to his bandmates, and, wearied of fame and looking for a new direction, they finally started to listen. To call <i>Blur</i> Coxon's record is a huge simplification (it also marks the height of Albarn's Bowie phase), but it does contain the first song that Coxon wrote and sang on a Blur record, the sweetly wooly ""You're So Great"". Much has been made of the Pavement and Dinosaur Jr. influence on his virtuosic playing, but Coxon has said that the record he was listening to most while making <i>Blur</i> was Big Star's elegiac <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i>. Alex Chilton was an artistic kindred spirit for Coxon. Both had experienced intense, <i>Tiger Beat</i>-cover-style adoration (Chilton had a No. 1 song with the Box Tops before he was 18) and had figured out early on that commercial success wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Chilton, of course, lost his foil too early when Chris Bell left Big Star and died in a car crash not long after. The tension that kept Blur going, in a creatively fertile, decade-long state of about-to-combust, was the push and pull between Coxon and Albarn.</p>
<p>""Graham used to say that he wanted to make an album that nobody would want to listen to,"" says drummer Dave Rowntree in the box's liner notes, ""But you can't do that in a band with Damon."" <i>13</i>, their second masterpiece, finds Albarn and Coxon's opposing sensibilities bleeding into each other like a muddy watercolor. Both were hurting. Coxon was depressed and still at odds with the rest of the band, and Albarn's long relationship with Elastica's Justine Frischmann had just ended. A coping method he'd picked up from blues and DIY alike, Coxon knew how to translate personal pathos into Blur's music. Both the Blur songs on which he sings lead, ""You're So Great"" and <i>13</i>'s ""Coffee and TV"", are candidly about his drinking, and on <i>13</i>, he guided Albarn toward confessional songwriting, too. Albarn had always used character songs to express emotion, but his songs on <i>13</i> strip away the protective covering of wit. ""I hope you're with someone who makes you feel safe in your sleep,"" he croaks on the gorgeous closing lament ""No Distance Left to Run"", while the wounded pop-spiritual ""Tender"" is an obvious career highlight. William Orbit's brilliant, painstaking production pushes Albarn's ever-present pop sensibility to the brink of dissolve. The <i>Third/Sister Lovers</i> comparison feels more apt here: <i>13</i> is a record in a sustained state of elegant unravel, full of the unexpectedly beautiful sounds that pop songs (and people) make while they're falling apart.</p>
<p>As time goes on, <i>13</i> sounds more like a definitive statement, and 2003's <i>Think Tank</i> sounds more like a post-script. Recorded in Morocco after the first Gorillaz record and Coxon's departure (he plays on just one track, the gloomy ""Battery in Your Leg""), it may be the only Blur record that suffers in retrospect. There are some great tracks (""Out of Time"" and ""Sweet Song"") but it doesn't quite pack the punch it did a decade ago. On the other hand, the newest track in the box, the archly grand ""Under the Westway"", feels like a return to form, which is to say it finds the band sounding like it hasn't quite sounded before. In the liner notes, James points to something true, recalling the <i>Think Tank</i> tour: ""It took at least four people to replace what [Coxon] does. Two backing singers, another guitarist, and a lead guitarist. And a percussionist."" Now that the band is-- tentatively, feebly, and contemptuously as ever-- back together, it's even more clear that Blur is the alchemy between these four people.</p>
<p>Like any box set worthy of attention, the sprawl of rarities offers some illuminating gems (an early demo of ""Beetlebum""; the underrated oddball 1992 single ""Popscene""), plenty of cheeky throwaways (a Seymour-era cover of ""Maggie May""; an orchestral pop snippet called ""Sir Elton John's Cock""), and, of course, omissions for never-satisfied diehards to whine about (mine include the original, <i>Leisure</i>-era recording of ""1992"" and the mid-tempo demo of ""Song 2""). The box also contains DVDs of two complete live performances, which tell two very different tales. The first is a show at Alexandra Palace in North London from October 1994. Blur are at the height of their first wave of fame, and the young audience is whipped into such a frenzy that they even sing along with the melody of the instrumental filler ""Lot 105"", as if they just need something to scream; the band gets off on it. Five years later, they are at Wembley Arena playing all 20 of their singles in chronological order. They look as weary as second-term presidents as they slog through the motions for the first three-quarters of the setlist, but at ""Tender"" everything shifts. Suddenly, they embody the material, coming achingly alive again, reborn on the stage.</p>
<p>If you need a through-line, try the story that those selected bookends tell: Blur are a triumph of feeling. They spent the first half of their career creating modern characters who'd become fashionably distanced from their own emotions and the next half actually, unfashionably, emoting. But that's just one straight line you could draw; why should you have to choose? Modern life is full of champagne and hangovers. So is Blur.</p></div>"|16877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16877-blur-21/|8.5|Lindsay Zoladz

Earlier this year he donned his favorite disguise for a fourth time on an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16436-serengeti-kenny-dennis-ep/"" target=""_blank"">EP</a>, rapping from the perspective of the titular dumpy Chicago mook named Kenny Dennis who loves brats, the Bears, and the Bulls, and who would kill to spend some time with Brian Dennehy. Serengeti's given name is David Cohn, and he has given multiple interviews in which he says that he likes rapping as Dennis because it's easier to be happy when you're in character. On his new record, <i>C.A.R.</i>, we see the flipside of that, with characters that don't stick around because bad things keep happening to them. For instance, Kenny Dennis loves Juelz, his faithful wife. On <i>C.A.R.'s</i> ""Uncle Traum"", the man who was cuckolding the narrator shoots the narrator's wife. It's not as fun to be that narrator as it is to grow a huge mustache and rap about Chicago sports.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Traum's nephew isn't unique in his troubles with women. 'Geti's characters are frequently lovelorn, rejected by the ones they need the most. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13799-talk-to-me/"" target=""_blank"">""Talk To Me""</a>, a disappointed, wannabe scuba coach repeatedly asks, 'Where you been honey? Where you been baby?"" Turns out his wife is missing too.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Elsewhere, the sadness doesn't have much to do with women. ""Cold"" details a bleak Chicago existence. There's ""dandruff everywhere/ Kids got colds/ Dishes in the sink, place smells like mold."" The details are tremendously well-realized and heartbreakingly specific. On ""Peekaboo"", a 12-year old 'Geti takes pictures of his neighbor undressing while she does yoga, until her brother Brad catches him and breaks his shoulder. It's astonishing how much we learn about the girl, whose name is Gwen, her father a soap salesman, along with a host of other little touches that bring the simple song to life.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This gift for detail is most often used for 'Geti to reimagine himself with a new identity, whether the essential change be in location, occupation, or name. The ethos is most succinctly expressed on the ironically titled ""Geti Life"": ""Quick, let me get drunk as fast as I can, so I can fall asleep and pretend to be a different man."" </p>
<p class=""p1"">On the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16436-serengeti-kenny-dennis-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kenny Dennis</i> EP</a>, we saw a successful escape into a stable new persona. But the characters on <i>C.A.R.</i> don't have the same luck. They're eternally shapeshifting, trying to find something that feels right. This inclination is amped up to hyperspeed on ""Chill"", where the narrator morphs a dozen times over, going from dentistry, to banking, to critiquing films, becoming a whoremongering novelist, a stone-carving gnome fanatic, a music student at city college in Hollis, a Bedouin-bedding heroin addict, and a vegan, amongst a handful of other personas. None of them works out. 'Geti lopes wryly through the identities up until the moment the song ends.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The album's centerpiece is ""Go Dancin'"", a song which combines the romantic travails and identity shifts of the other tracks into one, viscerally catchy and deeply painful rant. The structure of the track is simple: On the first verse, 'Geti proposes a bunch of new romantic plans to keep a relationship alive. As many of his suggestions are absurd, it's clear that they're not going to happen, anchored as they are by that cliché, relationship-renewing promise to go dancing. On the second verse, things haven't worked and 'Geti bitterly informs the girl of the things that he will do alone. It's clear that he isn't going to do these things either. Some infernal alarm clock is going off in the background the entire time and at the end of the song, in the back of the mix, some despairing soul screams, ""we're not immortal,"" over and over again. Though this might sound almost comically depressing, the fact is that many of these details are not evident upon first (or second or third) listen. What comes across most strongly is Serengeti's laid-back, spoken style and a set of a set of mellow, fuzzy beats, many of which sound as if <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11104-odelay-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank"">Odelay</a>-</i>era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"" target=""_blank"">Beck</a> and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/621-guero/"" target=""_blank"">Guero</a>-</i>era<i> </i>Beck met and co-produced a rap album.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Anticon in-house producer Odd Nosdam and DJ/producer Jel handle the beats, and they do a great job. ""Greyhound"" is made up of faded little scraps of melody wilting atop a dirty drumbeat, occasionally breaking for block party sirens and scratching from Jel. All these instrumental touches help to disguise Serengeti's disguises and make the album into an engaging, laid-back summer listen-- which makes the subjects of the songs all the more enthralling when you finally unpick them. </p>
<p class=""p1"">'Geti attempts perhaps the most unworkable transformation on the song <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13620-amnesia/"" target=""_blank"">""Amnesia""</a>. After the rapper describes his dream of being a man named Peter Panagos who owns a street cart, he closes the song out by repeatedly describing Panagos as ""a man of the people."" Serengeti will never be a man of the people, at least not while making albums like <i>C.A.R.</i>. It's too sad, too heavy, and too oblique. But <i>C.A.R. </i>is an excellent, devastating record, a chronicle of the amiable pessimism and occasional nihilism of a rapping Bukowski who can't seem to find a way out of the condition in which he finds himself.</p></div>"|16870.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16870-car/|7.6|Jonah Bromwich

Perhaps that's unsurprising, given the often sketchy nature of the material, a band's early attempts at finding their sound. All of the music here predates Múm's 2001 debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5502-yesterday-was-dramatic-today-is-ok/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yesterday Was Dramatic - Today Is OK</i></a>, a seemingly out-of-nowhere record still beloved by listeners of a certain age, folks for whom the meeting of indie pop and the less-aggressive end of IDM was a long-awaited dream come true.</p>
<p>Hardly anyone is making music like this these days, at least not with the kind of profile Múm once enjoyed, so it's weirdly enjoyable to dip back into this almost-forgotten style. Múm's childlike electro-pop-- with its windup-toy rhythms and mechanical music box melodies and kiddie chamber music touches-- remains some of the best of its sort. Tracks like ""Gingúrt"" imagine what Kraftwerk songs might have sounded like if covered by Conky the stuttering beatbox robot from ""Pee-Wee's Playhouse"", i.e., cute and kitschy and dated in a good way. Like any sugary substance, Múm's early music is very tasty in very controlled doses.</p>
<p>But this was a sound that seemed to be everywhere in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and it was easy enough to burn out on its unrelenting tweeness after airing a few compilations by the likes of Nobukazu Takemura's Child's View label. Listening to <i>Early Birds</i>, even if you haven't paid attention to this scene in years, it's not long before you're remembering how exhausting this stuff could be. One can only take so many primary color melodies, always either chipper or glum, and those drums reminiscent of a caffeinated kindergartener making a kit out of wooden blocks, using safety scissors for sticks.</p>
<p>If anything dates <i>Early Birds</i>, it's the drums. A good percentage of these tracks are built around the hyper-antic programming of drill'n'bass, a sound that peaked in terms of creativity a few years before Múm even started making music. It may seem cruel to compare most electronic acts to Richard D. James, but up against something like ""Girl/Boy Song"", a very audible influence on Múm here, the flailing of the drums on tracks like ""Bak Þitt Er Sem Rennibraut"" and ""Insert Coin"" sound like a thin and unconvincing take on the real deal, all of the speed and none of the flair. They're fast and choppy, because that's how drums were programmed at the time, but they lack even the zany excesses of the style's more hacky practitioners. Múm sound childlike here in a very different sense, young people trying to get to grips with the influence of more mature artists.</p>
<p>Early on, what always saved Múm's music from cuteness overload was an attention to moody textures in otherwise lightweight music. And while, after almost a decade of post-rock, they weren't reinventing the wheel to the extent their fans sometimes claimed, they also achieved a strong balance between their bright synthetic side and rougher-edged live playing. You can hear them stretching in that direction here, but with a frustrating inconsistency.</p>
<p>""Bak Þitt"" actually opens and closes with some lonesome piano, on a muffled tape that sounds more like a spooky field recording than something birthed in a hard drive. Sadly, Múm never develop the tension inherent there, simply dropping the murky instrumental in as bookends to the song's zippy electronic middle. Better are tracks like ""Loksins Erum Vio Engin (Natturuoperan Song)"", where happy-sad accordion and the faintest of la-la-la vocals are smeared over distant-sounding electronics, like some daydream of a outdoor Parisian café, listening to a street musician while people play Francoise Hardy and Mouse on Mars records in the apartments above you. Building fantastical environments, part sampled real-world texture and part wholly imagined sonic fairy tale, was something Múm once did very well, and we get our first tastes of it here.</p>
<p>They also love that accordion, and it figures in most of the best moments on <i>Early Birds</i>, along with a few of the clangers. An outer-space lullaby like ""Múm Spilar (La La La)"" is so unerringly lovely and richly textured that it's <i>almost</i> worthy of something off composer Raymond Scott's proto-ambient kiddie album <i>Soothing Sounds for Baby</i>. Again it's the unexpected wheeze of the accordion, along with Múm's increasing assurance in orchestrating their layers of tactile and ethereal texture, that elevates ""Múm Spilar (La La La)"" above bland chill-out music for infants. Play it more than once or twice in a day, though, and the track's all-smiles fluffiness will probably start to grate if you're not an actual toddler in need of a nap.</p>
<p>These more assured moments, gorgeous and swimming with detail even when simply playing with worn-out clichés, are why <i>Early Birds</i> can hardly be called a total falure. When they wanted, Múm could already do abstractly affecting without also tipping into cloying sentimentality. But since the bulk of the compilation is so second-rate and saccharine, an obvious learning experience put on tape, <i>Early Birds</i> is inessential, unless you were really dying to hear a beginner's take on the IDM class of 1999.</p></div>"|16834.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16834-early-birds/|5.2|Jess Harvell

Their debut LP, 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/7544-show-no-mercy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Life's Trade</i></a>, was a landmark of modern American doom, even if no one knew it then. Nearly an hour's worth of shifting, sludgy, atmospheric, and altogether beautiful metal was offered, and those who fell under its spell fell hard. The only problem was, Samothrace kept it mostly to themselves. The band toured, briefly; they underwent some lineup changes, stealthily left their home of Lawrence, Kansas, crossed state lines to resettle in the Northwest, then eased back down into their slumber. Rousing sleepily from time to time to assure us that they really were working on new material, the band members drifted into other projects, most notably bassist Dyan Desmond's startlingly good funeral doom duo Bell Witch. Finally, at the tail end of 2011, their name began to pop up once again-- a gig with Mournful Congregation here, a whispered breath about new songs there, until at long last, a May announcement came that revealed a new full-length was on its way. Brought to us again by the impeccably turned-out 20 Buck Spin, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13910-samothrace-reverence-to-stone/"" target=""_blank""><i>Reverence to Stone</i></a>'s two songs clock in at 14 and 20 minutes, respectively, and yet it still feels like they're holding out on us.</p>
<p>""When We Emerged"" starts softly, gently, allowing the buildup to burn out before the inevitable crash. Lush and expansive without sacrificing the despondent undertones and crushing heaviness of truly great doom, the song drags itself through fire and ice, into glistening melodies and out of howling voids. Bryan Spinks' earth-shaking roars are menacing and hopeless in equal measure. Rough, ragged, and guttural, his vocals offer an almost startling contrast to the refined melodicism of the music itself, and yet, it works. These vocals surface when necessary, in careful measure; Spinks' hoarse wails never overpower, but serve only to augment. The riffs wend their way through, low-slung and tantalizingly slow, and are momentarily overshadowed by the sweeping solo that spirals through at the halfway mark and cuts through the gloom, as glorious as it may be. In terms of rhythm, Desmond's basslines hold everything together and power <i>Reverence to Stone</i>, while drummer Joe Axler, also of Book of Black Earth, is more understated. As crucial as balance and dynamics are to this kind of music, a band is only as good as its drummer; luckily, the guitarists behind Samothrace have found themselves the perfect foil. Axler's crash cymbals do most of the grunt work, while his heavy-handed approach to slow, purposeful doom drumming works wonders within its narrow confines. After nearly 15 minutes, the song draws itself to a close, then collapses inwards, heaving and shuddering under reams of feedback.</p>
<p>With ""A Horse of Our Own"", there's no buildup and no time to prepare for the avalanche. Immediate immersion, as if the band itself was tired of waiting and eager to tear into the next song (which, after four years, would make sense). A bluesy, wailing solo sets the stage for Spinks, and the main riff unfurls at the speed of burning sulfur. A quiet, contemplative instrumental section diffuses the intensity for about three minutes, and then the hammer comes crashing down once more. The clear, mournful chords ringing through the latter half of ""A Horse of Our Own"" could have been plucked straight from <i>Life's Trade</i>'s ""Awkward Hearts"", a testament to Samothrace's ablity to sound like no one but themselves. There is continuity here. This album is a worthy successor, not an interloper or pale imitation.</p>
<p>The production on <i>Reverence to Stone</i> is warm and open, deftly handled by Brandon Fitzsimons (ex-Wormwood) and mastering engineer Greg Wilkinson, whose past work with Brainoil and Graves at Sea had very clearly prepared him for the job of isolating and coaxing each tone into its fullest, richest incarnation. The album sounds huge, and makes good on the lofty expectations it's been faced with from the get go. The only real complaint one might lodge is that it's simply too short. Give us more. We've waited this long, and we'll be here for the next round, but don't be cruel.</p></div>"|16774.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16774-reverence-to-stone/|8.2|Kim Kelly

And yet outside of the blues and jazz, Schaeffer's work with radio, tape, and gramophones-- as well as his ""sampling"" of everyday sounds and then reconfiguring them-- might be the most crucial musical development of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Schaeffer's pioneering work resounds through every strand of modern music in this new century. Imagine purging your iPod of anything featuring a trace of electronically generated tones, mechanized instrumentation, samples and loops, cut-ups, computer editing, and the like, and see what you have left in your playlists. What Schaeffer (and other crafty Frenchmen quick to realize his achievements, followed seven years on by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop) did was realize sound itself as something musical, regardless of instrument, note, scale, or whatever western music trappings. Alongside the paradigm-shoving efforts of composers like Edgar Varèse, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6215-john-cage/"">John Cage</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9074-karlheinz-stockhausen/"">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a>, no longer would western music be beholden to melody, harmony, rhythm, meter.</p>
<p>In 1951, Schaeffer along with fellow composer and percussionist Pierre Henry founded INA-GRM studio (Institut National Audiovisuel, Groupe de Recherches Musicales) in Paris, France, and for decades, experimental music titans like Henry, François Bayle, Iannis Xenakis, Michel Chion, Bernard Parmegiani, and Luc Ferrari pushed electronically composed music to the furthest edges. So when laptop noisemakers like Pita, Christian <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"">Fennesz</a>, Russell Haswell, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/168-autechre/"">Autechre</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/17431-florian-hecker/"">Florian Hecker</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/"">Jim O'Rourke</a>, and the like blipped up in the 90s, there was a clear lineage back to what seeped from INA-GRM.</p>
<p>However, simply <i>hearing</i> Schaeffer's groundbreaking work hasn't always been easy. Aside from a 4xCD box/book issued in 1989, not much from Schaeffer or the INA-GRM stable has been readily available stateside. So it makes perfect sense that the revitalized Editions Mego imprint pays tribute to those astounding and ludicrously rare compositions with their new vinyl reissue sublabel, Recollection GRM. The label's inaugural reissues-- of Schaeffer's last composition (and lone purely electronic work) <i>Le Trièdre Fertile</i> and a composition from his student Guy Reibel-- hint at the back catalog's unplumbed depths, and the promise of some real treasures to come.</p>
<p>To be honest, some of Schaeffer's earliest études-- emanating from the decimated post-WWII European landscape in 1948-- never quite grabbed me the way that the oeuvres of fellow countrymen like Luc Ferrari, Pierre Henry, or Bernard Parmegiani did, which might just be a matter of originator vs. innovator. (In my mind, no one will ever quite match the playfulness, gorgeous impressionism, and even perversity of Ferrari's greatest works.) But <i>Le Trièdre Fertile</i> suggests that I grossly underestimated Schaeffer's prodigal talents, as Schaeffer's exploration of the limits of frequency, duration, and intensity on modular synthesizer show him still pushing at the frontiers, even while closing in on 70.</p>
<p>The blips and bloops of ""Plutôt Dynamique"" that begin the piece soon begin to mutate, bouncing from alien ambience to something more visceral. The nervous tones of ""Plutôt Mélodique"" soon sound like two freight trains passing before transforming again into a buzzing drone and accelerating once more. At times, you can almost feel your ears move in and out of focus with these electronic figures, as if simply hearing these tones causes them to change. Or, listen to ""Strette"" and hear how a synthesized sound grows in menace and velocity as if nearing the listener, increasingly frantic before dissolving into pings, squiggles, and ambient washes. Even the most open-eared listener might not be able to immediately trace these abstract pieces directly back to producers like Actress or Clams Casino, but neither would be conceivable without the example set forth by Schaeffer.</p>
<p>Guy Reibel was an early student under Schaeffer at INA-GRM as well as French composer Olivier Messiaen, collaborating with the former on the 1967 composition <i>Solfège de l'objet sonore</i>. Throughout his discography, Reibel often dealt with the human voice-- be it mixing choir with magnetic tape for the late-60s work <i>À Mille Et Une Voix</i> or recording all of Gyorgy Ligeti's chorale works (cue the monolith scene from <i>2001</i> here) in the late 80s-- but on this reissue, he explores what the liner notes call ""the mathematical idea of the limit.""</p>
<p>What that might mean exactly I'll leave to the listener, though there's an exploration of granular and pulsar synthesis that anticipates what modern computer music composers like Alberto de Campo, Curtis Roads, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3793-sun-pandamonium/"">Florian Hecker</a> do in their own work some two decades on. High-pitched insect buzzes and a clatter not unlike rummaging in a desk drawer occupy most of the first half of the album, and at times there are sounds that exactly replicate that arid sensation of desert wind blowing sand into your face.

Part of what made Ross' Big Leap possible, now that it's over, was the fact that he was allowed to do it on his own bizarre terms: <i>Deeper Than Rap</i>'s street single, ""Mafia Music"", swatted 50 Cent, unprovoked, at the exact moment that Ross' own reputation was most fragile. It had no chorus, just four minutes of Ross huffing about Bob Marley, Whitney Houston, and how the dope in his trunk made the car ""smell like blue cheese."" The album itself was overstuffed for a summer-radio takeover that Ross was in no position to reasonably expect. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14482-teflon-don/"" target=""_blank""><i>Teflon Don</i></a>, just one year later, shortened its running time to an equally absurd 11 songs, as if Ross felt the next logical move was to remind rap fans of <i>Illmatic.</i> Both succeeded because they were fired by the flames of Ross' outrageous self-belief. He built a self-contained, no-reality-allowed planet, and spending time there was good for the soul. </p>
<p><i>God Forgives, I Don’t</i>, by comparison, feels depressingly earthbound. The entire rap industry now worships Ross: At last May's Maybach Music Group conference, Lyor Cohen, Diddy, Swizz Beatz, and others showed up to shower ridiculous accolades on Ross (Diddy: ""I think Rick Ross will go down in history as one of the great record men."" Lyor: ""Having a conversation with Ross is like having a conversation with Nas or Hova."" Swizz Beatz: ""Rick is also a painter, an artist; he understands Basquiat""). He is no longer the former punchline defying gravity: He is the center of gravity, and <i>God Forgives</i> is the first project of his to bend under the weight of rap-industry expectation.</p>
<p>In fact, L.A.Reid himself shows up on ""Maybach Music IV"", muttering about how ""it takes a boss to recognize a boss."" Reid's presence is unforgivable, not even by God: It's like having your party crashed by your high school principal. The moment may be more viscerally unappealing than picturing Ross taking advantage of the $24,000 toilet he brags about on ""Hold Me Back"". The only other guest on ""Maybach Music IV"", the latest installment of a series that has featured guest appearances by Jay-Z, Kanye West, T.I., and Erykah Badu, is... Ne-Yo, i.e., The Guy Who Sings On Your Def Jam Album When You No Longer Have Any Control Over Your Own Commercial Destiny. Even the beat is a tired jazz-fusion retread of ""Maybach Music III"".</p>
<p><i>God Forgives</i> is an unsteady vehicle like that, the kind of misfortune-plagued summer blockbuster with visible seams: All that money invested, and they didn't fix that one shot where the spaceship looks like a sticker? How did a song called ""Diced Pineapples"" end up on the album still called ""Diced Pineapples"", and why did they let Wale kick it off telling a woman he intends to figure out how deep her birth canal is?  When Ross shows up on ""Hold Me Back"", he is painfully, jarringly out of time with the track, panting after the beat like a winded fat uncle trying, and failing, to tag his 10-year-old nephew ""it."" You can almost see him bent over, his hands resting on his knees, while the downbeat speeds away from him.</p>
<p>The ""biggest"" moments, like ""Maybach Music IV"", are the most leaden: ""3 Kings"" is the big-event track, with verses from Dr. Dre and Jay-Z. All three verses can be summed up in a single line. For Dre, it is ""YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO THIS BEAT THROUGH MY HEADPHONES!"" For Jay, it is ""Niggas couldn't walk in my daughters' socks/ Banksy, bitches, Basquiats."" For Ross, it is the clanging, charmless ""Come and suck a dick for a millionaire!"" All three bring their C game, and the result is lethal. The beat bears the name of Jake One, a producer who usually graces his music with analog warmth, but Dre's surgical-gloves mixing vacuums out every trace of humanity. Deep into his <i>Detox</i> oblivion, Dre's production has  come to sound the way George Lucas' <i>Star Wars</i> prequels look-- sterilized, molded-plastic, and soulless.  </p>
<p>There is still some great music on <i>God Forgives</i>, but it is somewhat overshadowed by these higher-profile misfires. ""Sixteen"" brings André 3000 into Ross' orbit, and Three Stacks obliges, like he does every few years, with a casually mind-melting verse. The Cool- and Dre-produced ""Ashamed"" is built on a great Wilson Pickett sample; ""Ashamed"" is a solid example of Ross' plush luxury rap done well. ""Ten Jesus Pieces"", the rare ""reflective Bawse"" moment, finds Ross barking about pulling prayers from his ""archive"" (even the guy's prayers are stored somewhere expensive-sounding) over Jeffrey Osborne's lovestruck ""Baby"". ""911"" sounds like it was recorded during the same time as the far-superior material on last winter's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16172-rich-forever/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rich Forever</i></a>, and is therefore excellent. The project is too big to completely fail, and it doesn't. But Planet Boss just became a much less fun place to visit. </p></div>"|16997.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16997-god-forgives-i-dont/|6.8|Jayson Greene

He'd walked out on a Virgin contract that had paid for two very good solo albums, and booted a management team that had, unbeknownst to him, traded his publishing rights for tour support money. While in the UK, he'd played some new demos for Alan McGee, who'd loved Mould's prior band Hüsker Dü since first hearing their blistering speed-punk cover of ""Eight Miles High"" about six years earlier. McGee ran Creation Records, which had just released <i>Loveless</i>. Abbo, the tour manager of Mould's opening act, played it for Mould while driving between gigs in a rental car. ""I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This was <i>the </i>record I thought was never going to be made,"" <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=8P4vm6ilwjUC&amp;pg=PT137&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Loveless%22&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mould remembers</a>. ""I was still wet from performing, we were racing to get back to London, and the whole thing was a religious experience. No one spoke a word for the entirety of the record.""</p>
<p><i>Loveless </i>reimagined the sort of fearsome, sustain-heavy guitar squall that Mould had plumbed from the depths of his righteous soul with Hüsker Dü. Suddenly, ear-splitting walls of guitar were cool again, and Mould quickly formed a new band (bassist David Barbe and drummer Malcolm Travis), and found himself with a record deal. Creation put out <i>Copper Blue</i> in September 1992 (Ryko handled the U.S. release) to great sales and universal acclaim. <i>NME</i> (who along with<i> Melody Maker</i> had started calling the music of MBV's myriad spawn ""shoegazing"") voted it their album of the year. It finished seventh in that year's <i>Pazz &amp; Jop </i>poll, on its way to selling 300,000 copies.</p>
<p>It makes sense that it would take something as game-changing as <i>Loveless</i> to push Mould back into the three-piece DIY-punk lane. With his first band, he'd helped invent the American stuff that was eventually labeled ""alternative."" The difference in rock music between 1987 and 1992 might have seemed infinitely vast at the time, but Mould was one of several solid links between the two moments. Punk had ""broken"" in 1991 (Mould <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103595/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">is in the documentary</a>, and was in the running <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/spin-interview-bob-mould"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">to produce <i>Nevermind</i></a>), and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", made by a band whose drummer <i>worshipped</i> Hüsker Dü, had more or less invented the Modern Rock radio format that Sugar would soon slot into. One branch down on the family tree is the <i>Copper</i> track ""A Good Idea"", which Mould calls ""an unconscious homage"" to the Pixies' ""Debaser"". The Pixies, whose ""Gouge Away"" provided the template for ""Teen Spirit"", and who had in 1984 recruited its own bassist by running an ad for someone whose influences combined ""Hüsker Dü and Peter Paul &amp; Mary."" It was as if Mould had never left. He was right in the thick of the musical legacy he'd helped build, dialoguing with his peer/descendents not by virtue of the instant nostalgia model of current vintage, but because one of the most prolific songwriters of his generation had a bunch of new ideas. </p>
<p>They were very good ideas. <i>Copper</i> is as impressive as any post-<i>Zen Arcade</i> Hüsker Dü album, adapting the approach he took with ""Makes No Sense at All"", ""I Don't Know For Sure"", and ""Could You Be the One?"" for the Alternative Nation, many of whom (myself at 15 included) were completely unaware of his prior band. (I remember a Hüsker/Sugar version of the classic ""did you know Paul McCartney was in a band before Wings?"" joke going around at the time.) A<i> </i>ferocious power-pop record, <i>Copper </i>is guided by Mould's unerring ear for melody and unrivaled nasal yelp that gives his lyrics an extra bit of acidic punch. The purest Sugar comes here via ""The Act We Act"" and ""Helpless"", two huge pop-rock anthems in the mold of Cheap Trick's ""Surrender"", but slowed down a beat, drenched in murky grunge fury, and bathed in a hiss of sustain and ride cymbal. ""Helpless"" rides its giddily ascending verse melody without need for a chorus, and ""Act"" opens the album with an impossibly dark riff that wouldn't have sounded out of place on an early Sub Pop compilation.</p>
<p>Thing is, I'd estimate about half of Sugar's fan base would argue that <i>Copper</i>'s best two songs-- ""Hoover Dam"" and ""If I Can't Change Your Mind""-- haven't even been mentioned yet. With its jangly chords and lyrics devoted to attempting to get inside someone else's head, ""Change"" could've fit fine on <i>Rubber Soul</i> with only a few slight alterations. On the expansive ""Hoover"", Mould pays reverence to the pristine 60s pop of the Beach Boys and the Left Banke, and the studio trickery of <i>Revolver</i>, with a lyric that begins by considering the vastness of the universe, and ends with him spinning down to the center of the earth, which he admits ""keeps me feeling warm at night."" The recorded version is built with synths and harpsichords, but the song sounds just as good as pure punk, evidenced by two fierce versions on the 1992 and 1994 live sets included in the reissue package.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">During the recording sessions for <i>Copper</i>, Mould kept some songs aside, labeling these darker, unfinished cuts ""B"" songs to <i>Copper</i>'s pop-driven ""A"" material. They would become the <i>Beaster </i>EP, released seven months after <i>Copper</i> to capitalize on what had become a groundswell of hype around Sugar, abetted by MTV playing ""Mind"" in semi-regular rotation. Far from leftovers, these tracks were more like transmissions from Mould's id rather than his ego. Or, as Mould said: ""I was out of my fucking mind with white-hate-light-energy-noise."" Uniformly gloomy, even grim at points, <i>Beaster</i> marks Mould's return to his <i>Black Sheets of Rain</i> approach, with a fierceness he'd not shown since <i>New Day Rising</i>. The album is bookended by the woozy, MBV-influenced ""Come Around"" and ""Walking Away"", and peaks with the titanic 12-minute midsection punch of ""Judas Cradle"" and ""JC Auto"". Those last two rank with anything on <i>In Utero</i> in terms of sheer force-- Travis' opening drums for ""Auto"" sound like nothing less than Bill Rieflin's booming trapwork for Ministry-- and of course sacrilegious content (the album was titled as a nod to Easter and released to coincide with the holiday. No one's ever accused Mould of not having a sense of humor). <i>Beaster</i> is the one recording that the fantastic Merge remasters do the most justice-- it's louder, deeper, and better than ever.</p>
<p>By early 1994, Sugar was the most successful band Mould had ever been involved with: ""two or three times bigger than the highest points of Husker Du,"" he estimates. <i>Copper </i>was selling like crazy, and the band had just finished an exhausting world tour. The band was now subject to hype, and the recording, release, and publicity for <i>FU:EL</i> were a tumultuous process, to put it lightly. Mould remembers watching coverage of Kurt Cobain's suicide on CNN during the initial sessions. Depressed and unable to get the right sound, he scrapped everything and started over. On top of this, leading up to the release of the album, <i>Spin</i> ran a feature on Mould centered around his homosexuality-- something that had been an open secret since his early Hüsker days, but which now gave him entirely new sets of questions to answer.</p>
<p>With ""Gift"", ""Gee Angel"", and ""Your Favorite Thing"", <i>FU:EL</i> contains three of Sugar's best songs. ""Favorite"" in particular is as wonderfully evocative of modern rock radio in 1994 as R.E.M.'s ""What's the Frequency, Kenneth?"", Liz Phair's ""Supernova"", or Pavement's ""Cut Your Hair"".

He'd walked out on a Virgin contract that had paid for two very good solo albums, and booted a management team that had, unbeknownst to him, traded his publishing rights for tour support money. While in the UK, he'd played some new demos for Alan McGee, who'd loved Mould's prior band Hüsker Dü since first hearing their blistering speed-punk cover of ""Eight Miles High"" about six years earlier. McGee ran Creation Records, which had just released <i>Loveless</i>. Abbo, the tour manager of Mould's opening act, played it for Mould while driving between gigs in a rental car. ""I couldn't believe what I was hearing. This was <i>the </i>record I thought was never going to be made,"" <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=8P4vm6ilwjUC&amp;pg=PT137&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Loveless%22&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mould remembers</a>. ""I was still wet from performing, we were racing to get back to London, and the whole thing was a religious experience. No one spoke a word for the entirety of the record.""</p>
<p><i>Loveless </i>reimagined the sort of fearsome, sustain-heavy guitar squall that Mould had plumbed from the depths of his righteous soul with Hüsker Dü. Suddenly, ear-splitting walls of guitar were cool again, and Mould quickly formed a new band (bassist David Barbe and drummer Malcolm Travis), and found himself with a record deal. Creation put out <i>Copper Blue</i> in September 1992 (Ryko handled the U.S. release) to great sales and universal acclaim. <i>NME</i> (who along with<i> Melody Maker</i> had started calling the music of MBV's myriad spawn ""shoegazing"") voted it their album of the year. It finished seventh in that year's <i>Pazz &amp; Jop </i>poll, on its way to selling 300,000 copies.</p>
<p>It makes sense that it would take something as game-changing as <i>Loveless</i> to push Mould back into the three-piece DIY-punk lane. With his first band, he'd helped invent the American stuff that was eventually labeled ""alternative."" The difference in rock music between 1987 and 1992 might have seemed infinitely vast at the time, but Mould was one of several solid links between the two moments. Punk had ""broken"" in 1991 (Mould <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103595/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">is in the documentary</a>, and was in the running <a href=""http://www.spin.com/articles/spin-interview-bob-mould"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">to produce <i>Nevermind</i></a>), and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", made by a band whose drummer <i>worshipped</i> Hüsker Dü, had more or less invented the Modern Rock radio format that Sugar would soon slot into. One branch down on the family tree is the <i>Copper</i> track ""A Good Idea"", which Mould calls ""an unconscious homage"" to the Pixies' ""Debaser"". The Pixies, whose ""Gouge Away"" provided the template for ""Teen Spirit"", and who had in 1984 recruited its own bassist by running an ad for someone whose influences combined ""Hüsker Dü and Peter Paul &amp; Mary."" It was as if Mould had never left. He was right in the thick of the musical legacy he'd helped build, dialoguing with his peer/descendents not by virtue of the instant nostalgia model of current vintage, but because one of the most prolific songwriters of his generation had a bunch of new ideas. </p>
<p>They were very good ideas. <i>Copper</i> is as impressive as any post-<i>Zen Arcade</i> Hüsker Dü album, adapting the approach he took with ""Makes No Sense at All"", ""I Don't Know For Sure"", and ""Could You Be the One?"" for the Alternative Nation, many of whom (myself at 15 included) were completely unaware of his prior band. (I remember a Hüsker/Sugar version of the classic ""did you know Paul McCartney was in a band before Wings?"" joke going around at the time.) A<i> </i>ferocious power-pop record, <i>Copper </i>is guided by Mould's unerring ear for melody and unrivaled nasal yelp that gives his lyrics an extra bit of acidic punch. The purest Sugar comes here via ""The Act We Act"" and ""Helpless"", two huge pop-rock anthems in the mold of Cheap Trick's ""Surrender"", but slowed down a beat, drenched in murky grunge fury, and bathed in a hiss of sustain and ride cymbal. ""Helpless"" rides its giddily ascending verse melody without need for a chorus, and ""Act"" opens the album with an impossibly dark riff that wouldn't have sounded out of place on an early Sub Pop compilation.</p>
<p>Thing is, I'd estimate about half of Sugar's fan base would argue that <i>Copper</i>'s best two songs-- ""Hoover Dam"" and ""If I Can't Change Your Mind""-- haven't even been mentioned yet. With its jangly chords and lyrics devoted to attempting to get inside someone else's head, ""Change"" could've fit fine on <i>Rubber Soul</i> with only a few slight alterations. On the expansive ""Hoover"", Mould pays reverence to the pristine 60s pop of the Beach Boys and the Left Banke, and the studio trickery of <i>Revolver</i>, with a lyric that begins by considering the vastness of the universe, and ends with him spinning down to the center of the earth, which he admits ""keeps me feeling warm at night."" The recorded version is built with synths and harpsichords, but the song sounds just as good as pure punk, evidenced by two fierce versions on the 1992 and 1994 live sets included in the reissue package.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">During the recording sessions for <i>Copper</i>, Mould kept some songs aside, labeling these darker, unfinished cuts ""B"" songs to <i>Copper</i>'s pop-driven ""A"" material. They would become the <i>Beaster </i>EP, released seven months after <i>Copper</i> to capitalize on what had become a groundswell of hype around Sugar, abetted by MTV playing ""Mind"" in semi-regular rotation. Far from leftovers, these tracks were more like transmissions from Mould's id rather than his ego. Or, as Mould said: ""I was out of my fucking mind with white-hate-light-energy-noise."" Uniformly gloomy, even grim at points, <i>Beaster</i> marks Mould's return to his <i>Black Sheets of Rain</i> approach, with a fierceness he'd not shown since <i>New Day Rising</i>. The album is bookended by the woozy, MBV-influenced ""Come Around"" and ""Walking Away"", and peaks with the titanic 12-minute midsection punch of ""Judas Cradle"" and ""JC Auto"". Those last two rank with anything on <i>In Utero</i> in terms of sheer force-- Travis' opening drums for ""Auto"" sound like nothing less than Bill Rieflin's booming trapwork for Ministry-- and of course sacrilegious content (the album was titled as a nod to Easter and released to coincide with the holiday. No one's ever accused Mould of not having a sense of humor). <i>Beaster</i> is the one recording that the fantastic Merge remasters do the most justice-- it's louder, deeper, and better than ever.</p>
<p>By early 1994, Sugar was the most successful band Mould had ever been involved with: ""two or three times bigger than the highest points of Husker Du,"" he estimates. <i>Copper </i>was selling like crazy, and the band had just finished an exhausting world tour. The band was now subject to hype, and the recording, release, and publicity for <i>FU:EL</i> were a tumultuous process, to put it lightly. Mould remembers watching coverage of Kurt Cobain's suicide on CNN during the initial sessions. Depressed and unable to get the right sound, he scrapped everything and started over. On top of this, leading up to the release of the album, <i>Spin</i> ran a feature on Mould centered around his homosexuality-- something that had been an open secret since his early Hüsker days, but which now gave him entirely new sets of questions to answer.</p>
<p>With ""Gift"", ""Gee Angel"", and ""Your Favorite Thing"", <i>FU:EL</i> contains three of Sugar's best songs. ""Favorite"" in particular is as wonderfully evocative of modern rock radio in 1994 as R.E.M.'s ""What's the Frequency, Kenneth?"", Liz Phair's ""Supernova"", or Pavement's ""Cut Your Hair"". (Though at the other end of the spectrum, the album's retro-kitsch cover art is redolent of that period's unfortunate postmodern pastiche fashion trends.) On the whole, though, <i>FU:EL</i> sounds a bit tired, if not grumpy.

Gone are the days when credibility was tethered to sheer lyricism, steady touring, self-promoted mixtapes, hard-won co-signs, major-label affiliations, or background. Masculinity and heterosexuality are no longer a given. Instead, in 2012 we have artists buoyed by novelty and crumbling barriers, hilarity potential, and glittery snowballs of online hype. If you could somehow cash in the head-spinning thrill of refreshing your Tumblr feed to find <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29257-danny-brown/"" target=""_blank"">Danny Brown</a> in Mark McNairy gear alongside Floridian princess <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30518-kitty-pryde/"" target=""_blank"">Kitty Pryde</a>, you could probably make a down payment on Kanye's newly-for-sale mansion. At this point it's still difficult to determine whether the new school is seriously overvalued or if we've just unnecessarily moored ourselves to outmoded guidelines for too long.</p>
<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/SASHA_DARAPPER"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sasha Go Hard</a> is a rising Chicago rapper who straddles both the old and current systems. As a baby-faced teenage girl, she wears the coveted contemporary badge of internet-savvy hip-hop outsider, frequently posting videos of her (often all-female) cohort rolling around in hypeball extraordinaire <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30357-chief-keef/"" target=""_blank"">Chief Keef</a>'s Southside Chicago neighborhood haunts, sitting pretty in oversized SUVs, and practicing dance moves. But on the other hand, Sasha is a traditionally solid rapper, and <i>Do You Know Who I Am?</i> is, above all, a traditionally promising mixtape from someone making steady, earned progress. It's a marked leap from an earlier tape called <i>Glory Girl</i>, and it's exciting to <i>feel</i> a rapper grow palpably better, brandishing tough-talking tunnel-vision confidence. </p>
<p>A lot here is owed to excellent production from beat makers as hungry for recognition as Sasha is. The fleshed-out beat selection from producers like Absolut P, Young Chop, and Block On Da Track here is sometimes monstrous-- the tape often feels like it's a machine lurching forward as metallic slugs slip and slurp through its many gears and tin pellets ricochet throughout its casing. The best beats-- like Absolut P's on the murderous ""A&amp;E""-- seem to rile Sasha up in the best way, acting as menacing vehicles for the compulsively simple, hypnotically repetitive hooks she's got a knack for. ""My lil' bad ass/ My li'/ My li' bad ass,"" goes one. ""Money/ Money/ Money/ Money/ I want more money,"" goes another. ""If you mad 'cuz I'm bad/ Then I'm glad/ 'Cuz you sad."" They pile up in long chain links, making it especially exciting when Sasha chooses to switch up her tone or employ a bit of wordplay, like on ""More Money"": ""On the beat go dumb/ And dumb/ And dumb/ Feel it froggie, <i>jump</i>."" On a song like posse cut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13813-im-hotta/"" target=""_blank"">""I'm Hotta""</a>, which features Chella H and her most immediate contemporary, Katie Got Bandz, she seems to stumble into her range by repeating the word ""bars"" in a startling way: ""Bars. Barsbars. bars. <i>Bawwwwrs</i>."" On the other hand, she shows her weakness on a couple of tone-deaf slow songs, ""You the One"" and ""Tell Me"". She raps far better than she'll ever sing-- nothing wrong with that. </p>
<p>One of the best things about <i>Do You Know Who I Am?</i> is that it sounds sustainable, consistent from front to back in a way that could easily yield two or three more equally assertive tapes this year. Barring unforeseen interference (namely: a premature major-label deal), <i>Do You Know Who I Am?</i> could preclude a run reminiscent of 2008- and 2009-era Gucci Mane, 2011-era Waka Flocka Flame, or pre-<i>Pluto</i> Future. It could be reminiscent of Nicki Minaj's <i>Beam Me Up Scotty</i>, and not simply because there's a song that's (very possibly coincidentally) titled ""Itty Bitty"" on here. For a rapper so perfectly suited to 2012 sensibilities, a return to tradition is oddly exhilarating. If anything, Sasha suggests a hopeful possibility that qualities like unfamiliarity and tradition, novelty and aptitude, hype and progress are not mutually exclusive-- in the future, the best artists will probably have all of it.</p></div>"|16952.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16952-do-you-know-who-i-am/|7.9|Carrie Battan

And that's because over the past six years White Lung have functioned in a distinctly underground and subversive mode. They've trekked Canada and the States on DIY tours through venues so small I inadvertently knocked into a mic stand when I saw them last month, in the stage-less, graffiti-strewn backroom of a dingy Brooklyn tavern. And their fast and frightening 19-minute sophomore record, <i>Sorry</i>, was out earlier this year on the small, hardcore-oriented Canadian label <a href=""http://derangedrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Deranged</a>, which also released some of the first material from a similarly pummeling group, Fucked Up.</p>
<p>But despite White Lung's threatening devotion to the more venomous corners of rapid-fire punk, <i>Sorry</i> is compulsively listenable due in no small part to singer Mish Way's successful pinning of a sweet spot between snarled yells, curled syllables, and melodic but equally intimidating, tobacco-tattered verse. The band's template recalls the earliest recordings by Hole, Babes in Toyland, or L7-- Way is not shy about <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/blog/happy-birthday-to-the-queen-of-noise"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">her affinity for Courtney Love</a>-- but compressed and sped-up to mimic the motions of classic 1980s hardcore. The latter is rooted mostly in the thoroughly relentless, rocket-speed drumming of Anne-Marie Vassiliou through the record's every track, which seems to know only one method of shifting tempo (""faster""). If those aforementioned riot grrrl references sound superficial, consider Way's <a href=""http://www.thrashitoutonline.com/2010/01/interview-with-local-vancouver-band.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">own description</a> of her band's sound: ""like the feeling you get when you pee on the prego stick and it shows you a plus sign."" </p>
<p>Way's most compelling moments on <i>Sorry </i>are those in which she's particularly hellish, strong, and lyrically bold. ""Wipe that look from your face/ I'll drop you back from where you came,"" she screams within the first 40 seconds of opener ""Take the Mirror"", over guitarist Kenneth Williams' subtle but noise-laden post-punk riffage. That fury returns on the hooky ""Glue"", where Way declares ""You're a dead horse riding/ I'm out for you."" These moments seem designed for thrashing pit-level shout-alongs, as does the cautionary chorus on ""Bag"". Elsewhere Way muses bloody and visceral lines that hone on the body, like ""Bunny"", where she ferociously sings ""I'll scrub your liver clean until I die,"" or ""Bad Way"", in which she melodically describes a collapsing face and snapping veins over some of the record's most scratched, anxious fretwork.</p>
<p><i>Sorry</i> has hardly got a distracted moment, but ""Thick Lip"" stands out as the band's most abrasive, collective assault. It functions like a sonic declaration of war, one that comes into focus as Way's lyrics acknowledge ""a pretty young girl"" in the back of your mind: ""We don't have real heads/ Instead we got legs,"" she shouts, setting off a tirade of lines that seem to hint at topical criticisms of backwards beauty standards. ""I know your big secret/ It's caked on your face,"" Way wages, and then the killer: ""I know that you're better/ Than most of this world/ But your thick dumb lips/ Tell a real dumb truth."" Interpret that one <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/10/lana-del-rey-lips-real_n_1268597.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as you wish</a>. Way pierces the song with a clear, perpetual shriek-- ""WHAT DID HE SAY?""-- that feels like one of her definitive moments. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8710-not-every-girl-is-a-riot-grrrl/"" target=""_blank"">Not every girl is a riot grrrl</a>, but here Way quite undeniably carries a torch for feminist punk heroes of decades past while sounding entirely present.</p>
<p>And so add White Lung to the ever-widening pool of contemporary bands drawing from punk and hardcore but staking their own territory: Iceage, the Men, and Cloud Nothings, for example<i>. </i>They might work off old reference points, but White Lung are architects of a raw sound that feels novel and ideal in 2012: inventive, precise guitar textures, palatable pop hooks, and terrifying speed. Recently, Way, who is <a href=""http://mishway.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">also a writer</a>, <a href=""http://noisey.vice.com/fr/blog/billy-corgan-and-mainstream-rebellion"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mused on her place</a> in the underground punk scene: ""The common understanding [is] that being in a band is not a viable career option,"" she wrote. ""We'll celebrate breaking even after every [self-booked] tour... and that's totally okay with me."" Time will tell if that will remain the case for White Lung. For now <i>Sorry</i> is their loudest statement yet.</p></div>"|16897.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16897-sorry/|8.0|Jenn Pelly

This was in 2000, back in Memphis. The Glands were playing a show at a small club ominously named the Last Place on Earth, and Reatard's band, the Final Solutions, had been added as a last-minute opener. It was not a good match: Where the Glands played studious southern indie rock, heavy on ambience and melody, the Final Solutions were loud, snotty, abrasive, and confrontational. They took the stage drunk and dressed in police uniforms. Reatard played drums. (Well, he sat behind the drumkit, but he did more arguing with his bandmates than time keeping.) At one point, he whipped out his dick and pissed all over his snare, while the rest of the band flailed around the small stage, knocking over the Glands' equipment and intentionally alienating the small audience.</p>
<p>At the time Memphis rarely got any good bands coming through, so I was pissed that a couple of locals would ruin an opportunity to see a non-local group. Besides it wasn't like the Glands were the Vines: Despite a breakthrough album, they remained obscure and cult-ish. But even after the Final Solutions' last song, the nightmare was far from over. Reatard planted himself in the audience-- right in front of me and my wife, in fact-- and heckled the Glands throughout their set. ""Piss on your drums!"" he shouted more than once. ""It's been done before,"" was their deadpan response. Shitfaced, Reatard wobbled and stumbled into people, elbowing my wife drunkenly. Right about the time I was getting sick and tired of it, right about the time when I was ready to give him one big push from behind and watch him hit the concrete floor, right when I was ready to kick him while he was down, his friends finally led him away. The show was ruined, but true violence had been averted.</p>
<p>Such is the dark side of Reatard's talent, which contained both creative and destructive impulses. A member of several local bands-- the Solutions, the Reatards, Terror Visions, Lost Sounds-- he sent energy out in every direction, some of it good and some of it bad. At the time, I thought ruination was his endgame, but with some perspective, I see that he was trying to tear down the scene in order to build it back up. At his most publically belligerent, he made some of the city's most exciting music, and it's unfortunate that it took his tragic death for his earliest bands to reach a larger audience, to be considered as something more than local music.</p>
<p>Of course, the Final Solutions were stunt rock, programmed to piss people off, but Reatard's other outfits proved much more durable, compelling, even exciting more than a decade later. The Reatards rewrote Memphis pop history-- R&amp;B, early rock, Elvis, 1960s frat rock, early-90s lo-fi-- into snotty, ahistorical punk whose self-loathing streak seemed to speak for a city convinced its best shit was in the past. Lost Sounds, on the other hand, sounded like nothing local: On a handful of releases in the early 2000s, the group-- Reatard, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1164-tronic-blanc/"">Alicja Trout</a>, and Rich Crook, with a revolving door of guest musicians-- mastered a stabby sort of punk/new wave hybrid, full of sharp guitars, inhuman synths, and accusatory vocals. Last year Fat Possum collected their best material on <i>Blac Static</i>, an essential entry into Reatard's catalog: It's some of the bleakest, more relentlessly dark, most nihilistic music he ever made. <i>Lost Lost</i>, a new comp released by Memphis label Goner Records, makes a fine complement: It's a collection of rarities for a band that really didn't have many non-rarities. Even rarer, it's the kind of odds-and-sods collection you might actually want to listen to as much as the albums. Songs like ""A Foreign Play"", ""No Count"", and ""Total Destruction"" rival the best material on <i>Blac Static</i>, even if the noisy between-song interludes prove distracting.</p>
<p><i>Lost Lost</i> gives the impression of a new band struggling to capture inspiration on tape-- to secure a sound, an identity, a mission. If they sounded almost cocksure on their albums, behind the scenes they had their hands everywhere, grabbing at various genres and suturing them together hastily and sometimes violently. They cover the Crystals' ""Frankenstein Twist"" as a rattily streamlined surf jam, led by Trout's sulfuric-acid vocals. Ratcheted to a kaleidoscopic keyboad riff, the too-short ""No Count"" is a fairly straight <i>Nuggets</i> rewrite but may be Reatard's finest moment here: ""Well, I'm a retard, baby, and my head don't work right,"" he sings with a mix of dejection and defiance.</p>
<p>Perhaps the single most defining aspect of Lost Sounds wasn't Reatard's scabrous guitar, but Trout's vintage synths. In the late 1990s, she was fresh out of the sadly short-lived group the Clears, who performed whimsical pop songs in feather boas and full Bowie makeup. If that group sounded joyously deviant with its cheerleader choruses and melted-ice-cream keyboards, Lost Sounds deployed those same instruments toward something dark, nervous, feverbrained. That's nowhere more apparent than on the six-minute anthem ""Total Destruction"", which begins with a Clash stomp before morphing into what sounds like a <i>giallo</i> soundtrack, like they're eating Argento mid-murder. There's fake blood all over the place. Trout's keyboards allow the band to attack and feint effortlessly as the song unfolds to reveal new layers of apocalyptic dread.</p>
<p>People may come to Lost Sounds to hear Reatard, but I'm guessing they'll stick around for Trout, who currently plays in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12032-pretty-loud/"">MouseRocket</a> and the River City Tanlines. Reatard is more of a sideman than a frontman here. Trout is the star, thanks to performances on ""Look at Me"" and ""No One Killer"" that mix punk aggression and classic-rock melodicism. It's her delivery of the chorus-- ""Ya ya ya ya ya! Total destruction!""-- that puts ""Total Destruction"" over and justifies its length. By contrast, she adds gravity and vulnerability to the early version of ""No Genetic Engineer"". Still, despite her strong presence, Lost Sounds never come across as a solo project. The trio was small enough and close enough that it pretty much had to be democratic: By nature of its lineup, every instrument played a prominent role in every song. The personal push-and-pull between the band members (Reatard and Trout were on again/off again dating during this period) created a musical friction that constantly redefined what the band could be from one song to the next, leaving them unsettled and musically adrift. For some bands that might suggest unfulfilled potential, but in this case it was Lost Sounds' potential, a constant cycle of creation and destruction and creation.</p></div>"|16905.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16905-lost-lost-demos-sounds-alternate-takes-unused-songs-1999-2004/|7.4|Stephen M.

Yeah, the accomplishments of MIT alumni in the fields of genetics, engineering, and computer technology are certainly impressive, but are any of those fuckin' with <i>Liquid Swords</i>? When I read literature on the aforementioned topics, I seem to recognize only the proper nouns and maybe the prepositions, so in the interest of confirming the greatness of <i>Liquid Swords</i>, I'll defer to someone who had a lot more experience with genius than I do: <a href=""http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/alberteins383803.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.""</a> And really, there's hardly a hip-hop record, Wu-Tang or otherwise, that demonstrates how knowledge is power in more easily understandable terms than <i>Liquid Swords</i>: You're certainly not on GZA's level, but he rarely goes over your head.</p>
<p>There's never been a shortage of ""real hip-hop"" acolytes ready to explain why <i>Liquid Swords </i>sent MCs into hiding in 1995. But the question with a reissue like this one is, ""Why has it endured?"" Because while the deluxe packaging certainly makes it a worthwhile purchase, it's far short of revelatory: In addition to a long interview with GZA in the liner notes, you get something described as a ""working"" chess set and a bonus disc of instrumentals in case you're the type who likes to spend a night with friends arguing about who gets to be RZA during ""4th Chamber"" karaoke. As to why it needs to come out in 2012, it's simultaneously welcome and wholly unnecessary in the same sense a Beatles, Velvet Underground, or Led Zeppelin reissue is: It'll never again be the sound of contemporary pop music, but it's equally impossible to imagine a time when it fails to be a rite of passage for the discerning, a ""phase"" of intense immersion and compulsive consumption almost inevitable after first contact. It's more informative and worthwhile to view its impact on listeners than other artists, and <i>Liquid Swords </i>is the easiest entry point once people start going beyond the Wu-Tang group LPs.</p>
<p>The reason? It's the most potent distillation of the Wu aesthetic as laid out on <i>Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)</i>. Whereas <i>Tical, Ironman, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx</i>, and <i>Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version </i>extrapolated upon themes and personalities that necessarily had to be curtailed in the interest of cohesion, GZA as a solo artist was essentially everything that distinguished Wu-Tang from other crews: strictly chess, kung-fu, battle raps, investigative reports, Five Percenter Islam. Most crucially, out of everyone in Wu-Tang's original formation, GZA is the only one who didn't seem to have much interest in being a star. Nor was he promoted as one, even if he did end up stealing the Wu's ""Chappelle's Show"" skits. Which still worked out: You didn't need to be a star or get much airplay to go gold back in 1996, and do you even know which track here was the first single? Do you recall ever seeing any videos from <i>Liquid Swords</i>? The album's lack of commercial ambition is also reflected in its status as one of the least sexual hip-hop records ever made. Off the top of my head, there are probably two total lines which acknowledge women as physical beings.</p>
<p>That asceticism was to expected, since on Wu-Tang's introductory posse cut ""Protect Ya Neck"", GZA was everything he would be for the duration of his career. In a single line, ""First of all, who's your A&amp;R?/ A mountain climber that plays an electric guitar,"" he conveys a righteous, hard-earned wisdom of someone who'd seen and experienced more things as an artist and a human being than everyone else in the Clan. Which was true. He's the oldest member of the crew, and like RZA, he had a formative and demoralizing crash course in industry rule #4080 that led to a long-forgotten curiosity of a debut in <i>Words From the Genius.</i> Those lessons inform GZA's lyrics to a great extent, whether it's a casual but fatal dismissal during ""Shadowboxin'"" (""Check these non-visual niggas with tapes and a portrait/ Flood the seminar trying to orbit this corporate industry"") and especially on ""Labels"", the track here that might lose new listeners most quickly because something like 85% of the companies GZA puns upon no longer exist. </p>
<p>And so then, <i>Liquid Swords </i>is a consummate MC's album, and finding a weak line on it is nearly impossible. What makes it all the more impressive is that he's rarely, as the similarly stentorian Chuck D once put it, rhyming ""for the sake of riddlin'."" He's not beyond a well-timed ""motherfuckin'"" to pad out his cadences, though, and it's most likely the record with the most consistently astounding use of simile, that easily and frequently abused stepbrother of metaphor. ""Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers,"" ""I bang like vehicular homicide and July 4th in Bed Stuy,"" ""that's minimum and feminine like sandals."" Outside of RZA's phenomenal third-eye verse from ""4th Chamber” (yell ""lynched the prominent dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew"" on the subway, it's fun), there is almost nothing here that can't be easily understood by a teenager.</p>
<p>GZA's rhymes here are incredible, but <i>Liquid Swords </i>isn't just GZA's only great<i> </i>album, it might just be his only <i>good</i> one (though fine arguments have certainly been made on the behalf of <i>Legend Of The Liquid Sword</i>). It's hardly surprising that the man who told his peers during the height of hip-pop commercial fusion ""make it brief son, half short and twice strong"" didn't have much patience for rap derived from classic verse-chorus songwriting. But nonetheless, his later albums would make it abundantly clear how everything went right for him on <i>Liquid Swords </i>in terms of hooks and beats and song structure. (Listen to the chorus of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkODMEGAZdA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Did Ya Say That?""</a> from <i>Legend of the Liquid Sword </i>or pretty much any track produced by someone not named RZA to get what I mean.) Really, 17 years after the fact, I'm still struck by how a record of such grim subject matter and ""opium scented, dark tinted"" music could actually be kinda fun. It's a crucial balance and even the most unhinged of the Wu are willing to exchange a bit of their own levity for GZA's gravitas. Ol' Dirty Bastard shows up in the only way that makes sense, refereeing a match between GZA and Inspectah Deck by yelling ""duel of the iron mic! It's that 52 fatal strike! <i>NUH!</i>"" Which is meant to convey absolutely nothing other than ""this is the illest rap battle ever."" Ghostface Killah sips rum out of the Stanley Cup while asking the toughest metaphysical questions on ""4th Chamber"". ""Shadowboxin'"" has no hook, but the interplay between Method Man and GZA made it a surprising interloper during frat parties in the late 90s. Catchy hooks abound, as with the playful reminiscence of the title track, the insatiable yet calm list of demands on ""Gold"", the impossibly bugged-out synth hook from ""4th Chamber"" tracing the flight of a mosquito. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">One of the many great things about <i>Liquid Swords </i>is that while it's an unimpeachable work of lyrical mastery, of fierce intellect and sound morals, it's in no way a record for prudes.  Yes, there are plenty of high-minded theological dissertations, particularly the Killah Priest solo curiosity ""B.I.B.L.E."".  But the criminology element is every bit as present as on <i>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx</i>. While Raekwon and Ghostface sounded high off their own supply, embodying Mafioso and druglords dealing with the extreme emotions, rewards and larger than life personalities, GZA is far more objective about the situation. After a classic skit (""<i>I think you do know him</i>""), he announces the start of ""Killah Hills 10304"" by yelling ""LIFE OF A DRUG DEALER"" in case you're unaware of the subject at hand. But even with that kind of straight talk, GZA still hovers slightly above the situation and his associates are indeed like chess pieces, functional pawns and slightly higher ranking associates who are still ultimately disposable-- the surgically-altered drug mules, solemn terrorists, low-level dealers and anonymous fiends. </p>
<p>The more important contrast to <i>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, </i>RZA's self-described ""summer album,"" <i>Liquid Swords </i>was clearly meant for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVUj3raTi8k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">winter warz</a>. During the first round of solo releases, RZA created a sonic template that masterfully mirrored the personality of every MC, and this is his most cohesive and visionary work largely because GZA was already so fully formed. Even the kung-fu samples are the most seamlessly integrated, from the unnerving retelling of a failed assassination which begins the LP to the slain warrior who ends it, befallen by a decapitation replete he always assumed he'd inflict on another-- it's impossible to shake the grotesque sounds of his final breaths, where his slit neck emits a wailing winter wind. It's the most horrific effect on <i>Liquid Swords, </i>but not by much: the soul and funk guitars were originally pressed to vinyl and hot wax, whereas here, they sound like they were brought out of storage from particularly forbidding meat lockers. The lo-fi digital hiss of Alesis cymbals and snares evoke dirty, crushed snow and black ice. The slightly off-key hook from ""Cold World"" would later be sung by D'Angelo, but it's the bundled-up, shearling and Timberland's rocking dude on the cover of <i>Brown Sugar</i>, not the simmering lothario on <i>Voodoo.</i> And yet, there are still strange pockets of warmth: the minimalist patches during ""Cold World"" that evoke the eerie, disorienting calm of city streets abandoned during a snowstorm, that guitar bump in ""I Gotcha Back"" flickering like a trashcan fire, the juking Willie Mitchell riff in the title track that RZA admits was a rare straight rip, but a very inspired one all the same.</p>
<p>I won't begrudge any purist who wants to hear the crackle of ""Duel of the Iron Mic"" or the dense murk of ""I Gotcha Back"" enhanced by vinyl. But to these ears, <i>Liquid Swords </i>is a winter album meant to be heard <i>in </i>winter which is why most of us grew enamored with it as a portable experience, lodged into CD players or Walkmen, and stuffed between layers of puffy coats on subways, school buses. Even a solo listen in a car feels fairly inadequate, you almost have to ice grill a neighboring passenger while you're listening to it, knowing that they're plotting on the same gold. It's a record to make your surroundings as cartoonishly violent as <i>Liquid Swords'</i> chessboard cover, when you recognize that you're, as GZA memorably puts it, ""trapped in a deadly video game with just one man."" I've lived in Los Angeles for the past six years and really haven't found a lot of times appropriate to listen to <i>Liquid Swords</i>. That's not an indictment of its quality; it's a confirmation of its monomaniacal genius. </p></div>"|16857.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16857-liquid-swords-chess-box-deluxe-edition/|10.0|Ian Cohen

""Narst"" was a banger, UK funky's rhythms strongarmed into grimier territory, where dense kicks steamrolled the snares and digital strings ratcheted up the pull between tension and exhilaration. ""Love Dub Refix"" found a wildly different use for that bass/percussion interplay: the drums clicked into delicate but elaborate motion beneath that wall of low-end, and it was topped off with a fluid, phased Fender Rhodes and Cooly G's own voice intoning declarations of heart-struck disconnect a'la neo-soul (""must be love… without you""). Either way, she was headed towards something that would take advantage of bass music's increasing genre flexibility, and do it in ways that rewarded close listening and dancefloor physicality at the same time.</p>
<p><i>Playin' Me</i> is the culmination of a couple of years' work since that '09 single, and what the lead-up singles hinted at-- the '86 Prince-via-Kode9 flourishes of 2010's ""Up in My Head""; the slow-boiling crest of the following year's microhouse-tinged ""Landscapes""-- is elaborated on even further. When she goes back through the lineage of her sound, from funky to dubstep to garage to drum'n'bass, she digs all the way back to the groundswell of synthesized, post-disco R&amp;B to give it a common thread. The first notes on the album belong to the sort of watery funk guitar lick that could've belonged to the solo on a '77 Brothers Johnson record, isolated as an emphatic refrain that would fit well on the intro of a '95 Faith Evans single, and then built around for a dramatic, looming melodic theme that is as good as anything else this year for idealizing what post-dubstep is capable of in a pop-friendly sense. ""He Said I Said"" is the track in question, and it's bristling with intimacy and anxiety alike-- but it also sets a precedent for how rhythm is deployed on <i>Playin' Me</i>, vividly developing the tense euphoria and spacious fluidity of that first single.</p>
<p>The vibe of the album is consistently, deceptively understated, intricacy taking priority over immediacy. But by the halfway point, the juxtaposition of complex drum patterns, slow-motion melodies, and heavily floating basslines makes this album's woozy intensity feel completely immersive. The way it passes through all sorts of different stylistic contexts makes it one of those records where its personality's better defined by its moods than any genre affiliations. ""Sunshine"" scans a bit like the more reggae and 2 Tone-indebted elements that made <i>Skream!</i> one of dubstep's biggest early crossover LPs, and its lovers-rock swoon fits well. Pushing things closer to a denser rhythmic focus lets her approach house and funky from multiple angles simultaneously, to invigorating effect; check the frenetic but clockwork-smooth collaboration with Baltimore house vet Karizma on ""It's Serious"" for proof. And when she lets minor-key menace creep in like it does on ""What Airtime"", it's bracing to hear her use those billowy atmospheric flourishes for something that rides on concentrated unease. The big trick in a lot of these tracks is this sly dynamic at work with the way she mixes her songs: if you want to really get a good sense of how she lets the snares play against each other, you need to push the volume up into the red. At that point, the bass will flood even more of your ear-space, while still sounding more warm than abrasive-- it doesn't rattle subwoofers, it melts them.</p>
<p>Fittingly enough, her vocals match the nuances of her production-- melodic but not really melismatic, evocative without shutting out the possibility of some elusive subtext. In a few of the songs-- ""Trying"", ""It's Serious"", ""Playin' Me""-- her voice is scarce enough to pass for the skeletal remnants of stripped-away vocals in vintage dub versions, allusive flashes of context overwhelmed by the sound system. In others, she's more direct: the deliveries of ""anticipation, waiting… explo<i>siooooon</i>"" in ""Sunshine"" and ""you want me, I want <i>yoooooou</i>"" in ""Come Into My Room"" are unashamedly sensual, but in a way that feels more like a deep internal monologue than a performance for an audience. She also somehow pulls off covering Coldplay's 2000 single ""Trouble"" by siphoning out all the maudlin Britpop grandeur and replacing it with a vocal that scans a lot more like genuine regret-- though those glitchy, skittering drums have nearly as much to do with it. It's the damnedest thing: Cooly G's music is spare, subtle, often quiet, filled with breathable patches of between-the-beats negative space, and yet there's so much happening beneath the surface that it doesn't really scan as sedate. This is music that knocks you over with a feather.</p></div>"|16866.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16866-playin-me/|8.0|Nate Patrin

And walks onto the certitude ground-- the soul's submergence ends."" As syntax, it's absurd. As content, it's absurd. That doesn't matter. What matters is Al Cisneros' delivery: sinister and premonitory, like an incantation to summon bad old things. Drums crash around him; cello and tamboura swirl. The distance between the truly awesome and the accidentally comedic in Om's music is always about a hairsbreadth.</p>
<p>For the sake of convenience, the band has always been classified as metal, but that's only for the sake of convenience. On <i>Advaitic Songs</i>, they cherrypick from Sufism, Catholicism, and Hinduism. One curious Yahoo! Answers user wonders if they are Satanic or Christian or Neither. Cisneros is deep into chess, and was formerly the bassist for stoner-metal paradigm <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30405-sleep/"" target=""_blank"">Sleep</a>, a band that wrote an entire 50-minute song called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16601-dopesmoker/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dopesmoker</i></a>. Om is not exactly metal; they're pan-global mystical music for the heavy-metal demographic.</p>
<p>Their first few albums, recorded exclusively by Cisneros and drummer Chris Hakius, were exercises in spreading as few notes over as much time as possible while still maintaining a clear, heavy groove. Part of what made them so powerful is how pared down they were. Ignore the shimmering Catholic icon paintings and the pan-Arab flourishes: If anything made Om's music religious, it was the sparseness of their sound, as committed and underfed as a monk.</p>
<p><i>Advaitic Songs</i>, like 2009's <i>God Is Good</i>, incorporates instruments like tabla, cello, and flute (which, admittedly, is made of metal). The paradox about them is this: With two people, Om sounded expansive; with more, they sound comparatively weak. The music is unmistakably theirs, but the intensity of it feels lost in the arrangements. Listening to it, I worry that at any point I may be visited by southeast Asian violins. Diversity, it turns out, can be a diluting agent.</p>
<p>There is an argument here, an argument about minimalist art and how our brain processes not only sound, but information in general. The author David Foster Wallace wrote that one difference between fiction and non-fiction is that in fiction the writer works from ""silence"" while in non-fiction the writer works from ""Total Noise, the seething static of every particular thing and experience."" Give someone two or three slow-moving parts to focus on, and a quasi-meditative state ensues-- this is why meditations follow a single mantra designed to wipe the mind clean of any other distractions.</p>
<p>Om have always started from silence. Lumbering tempos, purity of purpose, and an ability to swing so hard and slow it sounds like they're struggling through water: This is why we came to them in the first place. Ornament and clutter: This is what we were trudging away from.</p></div>"|16868.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16868-advaitic-songs/|5.2|Mike Powell

Forthcoming efforts from mainstays like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27866-mungolian-jet-set/"" target=""_blank"">Mungolian Jetset</a>, Woolfy vs. Projections, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26440-windsurf/"" target=""_blank"">Windsurf</a> exhibit an enthusiasm for the sound even though the spotlight has turned elsewhere. Newcomers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30516-poolside/"" target=""_blank"">Poolside</a> prove that outsiders haven't lost interest, even if their debut album mostly just remind us of the halcyon days of 2007-08 when both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12663-air-france/"" target=""_blank"">Air France</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5126-studio/"" target=""_blank"">Studio</a> were going concerns. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/16903-idjut-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Idjut Boys</a> were content to let that last wave of attention pass them by, popping up mostly on remixes and some EPs, but they're the OGs of this very particular game, clocking 12""s as far back as 1993.</p>
<p>The duo-- Londoners Daniel Tyler and Conrad McDonnell-- would rightly bristle at being lumped in with any kind of movement, because when you've been making music for 18 or 19 years, you're likely to have made enough of it differently, even if just to you, that such label tags will seem extra silly. They've crafted a career of dance music that has steadfastly avoided the prevailing dance paradigms-- house, techno-- of their day. For the last half-decade or so they've hovered around the Smalltown Supersound galaxy in an uncle-shaped saucer, steering artists like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2619-lindstrom/"" target=""_blank"">Lindstrøm</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7602-prins-thomas/"" target=""_blank"">Prins Thomas</a>, and Mungolian via remixes and collaborations. They specialize in lightweight bodyrock, not explicitly beachy but breezy enough to serve as a proxy.</p>
<p><i>Cellar Door</i> is, shockingly, their first artist album, a 38-minute tart that wisely avoids the temptation to sum or define their career. (Though might I humbly request a collection of 12""s/remixes, friends?) Instead, it's a idly stitched collection of funk, disco, and pop so unassuming that its lack of coherence feels like a virtue. Eight-song records feel like they should have a center, something to talk and build around, but <i>Cellar Door</i>'s keeps shifting, like light moving on the floor as the day progresses. The first single, ""One for Kenny"", is the album's most danceable track, candy disco that moves at the same pace as a comforting lava lamp. Halfway through it eases (there are no sharp movements on <i>Cellar Door</i>) into a gorgeous, jazzy piano line. It feels like someone draped a warm blanket over the track. </p>
<p>Two long vocal ballads-- ""Shine"" and the ""The Way I Like It"", both featuring Sally Rodgers-- are well-formed and tender. The latter, in particular, details an appreciative lust, thankful and tense until its beautiful, windswept second half. ""Going Down"" and ""Love Hunter"" employ ringing acoustic guitars, harmonic complexity coloring standard rhythms. ""Le Wasuk""'s proggy, diffuse raggae is the only true misstep, and the Idjut Boys redeem themselves with sunset-beautiful ""Jazz Axe"", two minutes of honeyed electric guitar to close the album.</p>
<p>Churls will indict <i>Cellar Door</i> for a lack of coherence, but the Idjut Boys have built a career on a lack of coherence. Dance versions of these tracks are reportedly forthcoming, and they'll probably be great. <i>Cellar Door</i>, though, is a frozen moment, a triumph and an oddity. Instead of justifying or summarizing two decades of work, Tyler and McDonnell set them aside and come up with a concise, lovely album that, like a gentle tourist, takes only pictures, leaves only footprints.</p></div>"|16924.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16924-cellar-door/|7.3|Andrew Gaerig

Human skulls, machinery, plant life, broken-down cars, barnacles, teeth, and satellite dishes all feature in his work, which includes the monochromatic cover art for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28187-oneohtrix-point-never/"">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13896-rifts/""><i>Rifts</i></a> and the more colorful 3D animation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29925-kuedo/"">Kuedo</a>'s video for <a href=""http://vimeo.com/38220729"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ascension Phase""</a>. For the cover art of this debut album under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30588-konx-om-pax/"">Konx-om-Pax</a> moniker, Scholefield imagines a space where mountainous terrain is chiseled out to host to a large factory building, which in turn is under threat from reedy, grass-like tentacles slithering up around its metal façade. He stops short of imagining a future where these elements can peacefully co-exist, instead creating an anarchic face-off where humankind, machines, and the natural world are all straining to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>It's a feeling that seeps into the music on <i>Regional Surrealism</i>, a mostly instrumental album caught somewhere between the chillwave-plundered ""half-remembered childhood nostalgia"" trope, impossibly severe dreams of the future, and the pastoral-electronic wistfulness of Scholefield's fellow countrymen <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"">Boards of Canada</a>. That flitting back and forth between styles is emblematic of his wider work in the art and design fields, which has taken in projects with fellow Glaswegians <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22485-hudson-mohawke/"">Hudson Mohawke</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"">Rustie</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2801-mogwai/"">Mogwai</a> (whose Stuart Braithwaite features on ""Zang-Tumb"" from this record). Konx-om-Pax feels like various strains of abstract thought circling one another, with only the loosest of ties binding them together. It takes place in a juncture between the big and the small, the real and the unreal. On the vast ""Pillars of Creation"" Scholefield constructs a fantastic glacial empire all of his own; on ""Let's Go Swimming"" if feels like he's straining to see a reflection of himself in a tiny, muddy puddle.</p>
<p>That fissure quickly opens up when <i>Regional Surrealism</i> begins and never closes up into anything that could be described as a hermetic Konx-om-Pax sound. This material has been collected from various points in the past six or seven years according to an interview Scholefield recently gave to <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/09326-konx-om-pax-quietus-mix-67-interview-regional-surrealism"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Quietus</a>, which helps explain its scattershot whims. ""Intro"" encroaches on the kind of plastic pining Joe Knight regularly conducts under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29974-rangers/"">Rangers</a> guise, while ""Slootering"" is a slavish piece of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perrey_and_Kingsley"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Perrey/Kingsley</a> worship that directs the album down a surprisingly quirky detour following the growing feeling of atrophy that precedes it. ""At Home with Mum and Dad"" best represents the latter feeling, with a series of loops shifting lugubriously across the same axis of yearning/darkness that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29335-demdike-stare/"" target=""_blank"">Demdike Stare</a> try to bridge, where the sound moves so sluggishly that it resembles the actions of someone scaling a mountain with a sack of rocks tied to their back.</p>
<p>The abundance of gloom shouldn't be a total surprise-- the name ""Konx-om-Pax"" is taken from the title of a series of essays published in 1907 by famed occultist Aleister Crowley, himself a beloved reference point for myriad musicians from many different backgrounds over the years. <i>Regional Surrealism</i> is only loosely anchored in that domain, but it's when Scholefield crawls into those blackened corners that he can divine his most impressive material. ""Glacier Mountain Descent"" is particularly striking, offering a subtle twist on Werner Herzog's opening for <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068182/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Aguirre: The Wrath of God</i></a> that hints at an ambition for Konx-om-Pax that far outstrips more frivolous material like the Braithwaite-featuring ""Zang-Tumb"". Those hints of humor are often symbolized in Scholefield's artworks, but here they have an unbalancing effect, only serving to detract from the portentous musical renderings of the uneasy symbiosis between digital glitch and the natural world. The potential for Konx-om-Pax feels boundless if he can find a way back to that latter space more often. </p></div>"|16954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16954-regional-surrealism/|6.0|Nick Neyland

Leading up to the release of 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15411-burst-apart/"" target=""_blank""><i>Burst Apart</i></a>, the frontman for Brooklyn soundscape-rockers the Antlers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41311-the-antlers-talk-electro-inspired-new-album/"" target=""_blank"">told</a> Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal that his band's fourth LP would be less emotionally wrenching than the previous record that put them on the map, 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13196-hospice/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hospice</i></a>. ""This is not a sad record... It does have an emotional punch, but it's a little less desperate. There are no life or death situations on this record, no terminal illness, no abusive relationships."" How'd that turn out, anyway? Well, <i>Burst Apart</i>'s opening song is called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12188-i-dont-want-love/"" target=""_blank"">""I Don't Want Love""</a>, and its closing song compares a relationship to a dead dog. Lovers are shunned, teeth fall out, hopelessness is conveyed throughout, and at one point the protagonist seemingly (and willingly) lets a house fire engulf him and whoever else there is inside. Maybe he was joking.</p>
<p>To be fair: While <i>Burst Apart</i> contained its fair share of emotional evisceration, the stakes did seem somewhat lower, or at least less immediately life-shaking. As a lyricist, words have rarely failed Silberman (see: the literate hospitalization-as-cohabitation narrative storytelling of <i>Hospice</i>), but with time he's developed a sense of linguistic economy, which has in turn made the displayed imagery more cryptic and threatening. Perhaps not coincidentally, as the word count decreased, the Antlers zoomed past the early specter of a <i>Funeral Jr.</i> albatross and evolved into something much more interesting: a warm, expansive, and at times hair-raising space-rock band with its attention turned toward fleshy matters, rather than the stars above.</p>
<p>There were hints of this potential to be found in <i>Hospice</i>-- big booming stretches of ambient guitar wash and tape-decayed vocals-- but that record's emotional, singularly focused claustrophobia was so intense and choking that when Sharon Van Etten showed up near the end of the trippy, strung-out ""Thirteen"", it felt like an intrusion. <i>Burst Apart</i> was all widescreen-lens, though, with guitars that chimed and rolled into some golden void, fog pouring out of keyboards, and so much empty nothingness surrounding the proceedings that everything took on a hollow 3D glow. The album's centerpiece, ""Rolled Together"", managed to out-Sigur Rós the great Hopelandic ones themselves in just under five minutes; when the band performed the song with Brooklyn bros Neon Indian for last year's regrettable <i>(together)</i> EP, they doubled the length. The results weren't ideal, but it made sense.</p>
<p>And so the Antlers psychedelically steamroll along with <i>Undersea</i>, a four-track release that's been described as ""an EP in length, but well beyond that in scope."" (If that sounds like bong-session speak, remember Silberman's perfect prescription for listening to ""Rolled Together"": ""best heard stoned with friends"".) Since the band become a multi-person concern and broke free from its solo-project beginnings, the Antlers have been credited for production as a group, and their sense of hermetic, mutually reliant interplay has never been stronger than it is here. As they often do, the trio's created its own world within the 22 minutes allotted here-- only, the vibe is pure aftermath, with smoke rising from fresh embers and the environment taking on a lush yet deserted texture. If <i>Hospice</i> and <i>Burst Apart</i> were dark, rolling hills headed toward catharsis, well, here's the bottom.</p>
<p>And what a gorgeous arrival it is. Every detail on <i>Undersea</i> sounds like breakable goods bought at a high-end flatwares store, and I mean that as the highest compliment-- it's all wrapped in thick, translucent gauze, not so much crash-landing as simply (but heavily) kissing the ground upon impact. ""Endless Ladder"", an eight-minute perpetual comedown with a title that's almost eye-rollingly evocative, surfs a single, stretchy riff with zen carelessness as frissons of synth noise and burbly echo-mic'd whine pass by. It's almost maddeningly head-in-the-clouds, but also something that, if it hits you at just the right time, you could possibly listen to on loop for hours. ""Endless Ladder""'s three companions on <i>Undersea</i> aren't as openly contemplative (although the harp-and-horn blare of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13803-drift-dive-crest/"" target=""_blank"">""Drift Dive""</a> certainly comes close), instead leaning on the dark sonic undercurrents of post-adolescent tension that makes this band a big deal to many people.</p>
<p>Still, the Antlers at their most mopey are still plenty elegant, so the dirge-like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46984-listen-to-another-track-from-the-antlers-undersea-crest/"" target=""_blank"">""Crest""</a> ripples with laser swooshes and rattlesnake percussion, mining new depths of total paranoia. Speaking of feelings: There are plenty of them on display (this <i>is</i> the Antlers, after all), as <i>Undersea</i>'s water-based theme finds a few uses for H2O other than pure hydration-- drowning, flooding, and subsequently destroying the world, and in the case of the sad-eyed kiss-off closer ""Zelda"", separating those who love one another.</p>
<p>Silberman's lyrics are as simultaneously distant and evocative as ever, but the overwhelming amount of detail surrounding them renders them somewhat irrelevant here, a bubbling treasure chest in <i>Undersea</i>'s sonically overwhelming fish tank. If you're the type that ""can relate"" to the Antlers' highwire drama, there's a solid chance this release could leave you cold. (On the other hand, if <i>Hospice</i> left you jeeringly and incorrectly shouting ""My Bloody Bright Eyes!"" then you just might love this.)</p>
<p>""I'm not listening to [Neutral Milk Hotel's] <i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i> as much as I was when I was 19,"" Silberman also told us back in the beginning of 2011, listing Portishead, Dirty Three, Boards of Canada, and the various strains of post-rock and electronic music as emerging influences in the now 25-year-old's musical mindset. Namechecking obscurists and hip-to-death backseat drivers (both of which are plentiful in the Antlers' native Brooklyn landscape) would quite possibly sneer at these admissions-- who <i>hasn't</i> had a moment with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/837-geogaddi/"" target=""_blank""><i>Geogaddi</i></a> in their 20s?-- but what struck me upon reading those quotes, specifically, was Silberman's sincerity in growing as a music listener.</p>
<p>So just as Silberman has laid bare his own messy, tormented angst as a means of moving on and becoming stronger, the Antlers as a band are growing up, and growing forth, into a career that's accruing fascinating weight with every move they make. They are a popular band, but in today's cool-kid, all-new-all-the-time musical culture, their emotional straightforwardness and debt to the since-canonical sounds of the past means that they perpetually risk being underappreciated. So ignore them if you dare, but consider yourself warned, too, that watching one of the biggest little groups in Brooklyn conjure such fascinating sonic shapes is becoming a reward in itself.</p></div>"|16860.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16860-undersea/|8.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

For one, it's hard to even call her a rapper; on <i>Reservation</i>, her first full-length to feature all original beats, she is as comfortable emulating Aaliyah as she is Foxy Brown. Like so many of rap's buzzing young internet stars of the moment, her background flies in the face of hip-hop's cultural bedrock: She grew up in the orbit of a Detroit-area church she has likened to a cult, and until her family fled when she was 16, Haze had little exposure to pop culture. Like Nicki Minaj, Azealia Banks, and Frank Ocean, her sexuality is vague (in her words: ""I'm free spirited &amp; I embrace gender-fluidity""), but it doesn't define her. Her music is deeply open, befitting someone just out of her teens who tweets and vlogs with no filter. The title <i>Reservation</i>-- and the small image of a tipi on its cover-- are a nod to her Native American heritage. But Haze is not just one of hip-hop's preeminent young faces; as <i>Reservation </i>readily displays, she's also one of its preeminent young voices.</p>
<p>Haze's ascension alongside (or in the shadow of) Banks will undoubtedly tie them together in a lot of minds, so it should be noted that they are very different artists. There are no theatrics with Haze, and her music and image (at least at the moment) have no intersection with the worlds of dance or high fashion. The cover of <i>Reservation </i>is telling-- just Haze, minimally dressed, in the midst of recording. The subtext is clear: What you see is what you get. While Banks is trying her hand at smoothing over the forced marriage of rap and dance music by introducing producers like Hudson Mohawke and Machinedrum, Haze is determinately whacking through the weeds of Young Money's rap kingdom. The ease with which she empties her brain while floating from rapping to singing recalls no one less than Lauryn Hill, but the mood and much of the sonics (as well her remixing a handful of his songs on previous mixtapes) suggest that Drake looms large. Her punchline- and simile-heavy rapping are purely latter-day Lil Wayne, except unlike this current incarnation of Weezy, Haze bites as hard as she barks. Even songs like ""CHI (Need to Know)"" and ""Drop It"" bring to mind Minaj's rap ballads if they were stripped of their focus grouped cynicism.</p>
<p>Haze isn't necessarily forging new territory by herself, but she's a standout figure merely by existing within the framework of her generation's popular rap music. <i>Reservation </i>is something that could appeal to a vast number of hip-hop and R&amp;B fans, but-- similar to young rappers Chief Keef and Lil Reese-- Haze has a unique ability to interact with her influences as well as the pop-rap world writ large while still remaining distinctly individual. That's not an accident, either. Like plenty of rappers, she expresses pride in being herself, but not in the boilerplate manner you get from a lot of artists that are in actuality just thinly veiled facsimiles of established stars. Instead, you get the sense that Haze has spent a lot of time thinking about and working through who she is as an artist and a person. On ""Supreme"", she bares her fangs and viciously addresses her competition (""I'ma keep on running with all of you bitches after me"") but she gamely undercuts her own swagger by singing an innocent chorus where she admits that she was at one point ""trying to be like everyone else."" The admission is brave and vulnerable, and her willingness to put herself on blast only adds power to her shit-talking. On ""This Is Me"", a song where she addresses both her family and a younger version of herself, she softly sings a chorus about finding her identity that seems wise beyond her years: ""Don't let me go/ Set my soul free, let me grow."" Songs like these on <i>Reservation </i>are both the result and the extension of rap's slow yet indefinite move away from Teflon masculinity.</p>
<p>Haze is the latest in line of artists redefining the image of rap, but that's not to say that she's abandoned (or is above) rapping for rapping's sake. Two of the most choice cuts on <i>Reservation </i>are <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13815-new-york/"" target=""_blank"">""New York""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13872-werkin-girls/"" target=""_blank"">""Werkin' Girls""</a>, where Haze proves that she can go toe-to-toe with any young rapper when it comes to flow and punchlines. Like Minaj, Banks, and even Drake, one of the most fascinating aspects of Haze's career moving forward will be how she further approaches the merging of hyper-lyrical rap and pop or R&amp;B, as there are some clear demarcations in style across the EP. That said, she has plenty of time to continue to grow as an artist, and one of the main takeaways from <i>Reservation </i>is that it should be a blast watching Haze do so.</p>
<p>Hip-hop is often suffocated by conversation amongst its fans and personalities that focuses on what popular rap music means for the genre, its culture and its future. Arguably no other genre is as beset by rampant copycatting, trend-hopping, and incestuous collaborations that seem to treat the idea of artistic vision as a luxury instead of a right. On <i>Reservation</i>, Angel Haze shows herself to be the rare rapper who has copped a great deal of contemporary popular hip-hop and R&amp;B and come out the other side as purely herself. The rap world is constantly in a state of flux and worry, but more artists like Angel Haze, and things should turn out alright.</p></div>"|16883.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16883-reservation-ep/|8.0|Jordan Sargent

No LOLs or emoticons for him, no clever abbreviations. ""Every word handwritten,"" he emphasizes on <a href=""http://www.thegaslightanthem.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Gaslight Anthem</a>'s fourth album, which is actually titled <i>Handwritten</i>. And no fancy electric lamps for Fallon: ""We only write by the light of the moon."" He's a defiantly old-school type-- he'd probably be a Luddite if not for electric guitars-- and the Gaslight Anthem get most of their moves from the 1950s and 1960s: girl groups, greasers, juvenile delinquents, rockabilly tough guys, and a certain gun-wielding super-producer. On the band's 2008 breakout album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12454-the-59-sound/""><i>The '59 Sound</i></a>, they turned these touchstones into heart-on-sleeve rock anthems meant to define a community of close confidantes, frayed lovers, and rock heroes, old friends long gone (""ain't supposed to die on a Saturday night""), and women with high-top sneakers and sailor tattoos. It sounded like a cry from a scene defining itself from the rubble of pop history, and there was no small power in their sound, which thrived on the past but resigned itself to live in the present.</p>
<p>Four years, two albums, and one side project later, Fallon has begun to use those same influences toward more personal ends: Rather than define himself as part of a group, he has been defining himself against the world, portraying himself-- and the characters in whose voices he often writes and sings-- as defiantly, proudly, grumpily out of time. You text, but he writes longhand. You put your iPod on shuffle, but he spins 45s (and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46356-the-gaslight-anthem-announce-new-album-tour/"">""45""</a> is actually the title of the new album's lead-off track). That self-determining sensibility has motivated scores of artists going back well beyond the Gaslight Anthem's frame of reference, but Fallon seems to be growing more self-righteous about it, the punk as curmudgeon. Worse, on <i>Handwritten </i>he sounds content to let some of his references do the heavy lifting, whether it's Ginsberg (""Howl"") or Van Morrison (the grave sha-la-las on ""Here Comes My Man""). If in the past he managed to transform similar icons into a communal mythology, here it too often sounds like regurgitation, as though the reference were an end in itself.</p>
<p>It might be more bearable if Fallon showed more of a sense of humor in his songwriting or had a vocal setting other than intense, but at the very least he's a hard romantic, which in this case can excuse a lot. He believes wholeheartedly in girl-group infallibility and in the profound wisdom of pop songwriting, so he's never afraid to come off as sentimental or mushy. It's endearing how he mistakes smog for ""the mists of Mulholland"" and impressive how he can sell a clunker like ""I'm in love with the way you're in love with the moonlight."" That may be the saving grace of <i>Handwritten</i>, too much of which seems to be addressed to women who are doing something wrong, who are emotionally careless. Rather than confessional, Fallon's songwriting is recriminative, constantly assessing responsibility and often painting himself as a messianic romeo. Midway through <i>Handwritten</i>, he sings, ""Who came to wipe all your tears away? Who came to give you back your dignity, babe?"" The answer is easy to guess, but it's such a loaded, ugly moment that it's tempting to take the needle off the record, take a breather, get some space.</p>
<p>But make sure to come back, just so you don't miss the whoa-oa-oas on ""Desire"", an effortlessly enormous chorus that give Fallon's philosophical more import than they earn. And if the acoustic ""National Anthem"" closes things out on a downer note, the penultimate track ""Mae"" churns up a noir-ish rock-and-roll drama as Fallon and his ladyfriend drive around the city and ""wait for kingdom come... with the radio on."" It's no anthem, more like a muted lament with a bleak-yet-hopeful ambience, and it points directly to the Gaslight Anthem's saving grace: No matter their flaws, they know that redemption lies somewhere on the dial, in an old tune we can all sing along to.</p></div>"|16856.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16856-handwritten/|5.7|Stephen M.

""Oldies are people who've stopped singing and gone on to do other jobs and every now and then, people dig them up and say, 'Let's go do an oldies show.' And when they finish that night they go back to their jobs. But we don't have no other jobs. Ken Boothe still sings, Frankie Paul still sings, Cocoa Tea still sings."" Looks like we could add <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22084-jimmy-cliff/"" target=""_blank"">Jimmy Cliff</a> to Minott's list. <i>Rebirth</i> is less a resurrection than a reaffirmation of the power of the now 64-year-old Cliff's remarkable tenor voice and politically lyrical acumen. Not to mention the power of roots rock reggae.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Produced by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3054-rancid/"" target=""_blank"">Rancid</a>'s Tim Armstrong, the music here is predominantly a pitch-perfect versioning of 1970s reggae. <i>Rebirth </i>not only has Cliff revisioning his roots, but so too Armstrong, whose career began back in the late 1980s with the ska punk sounds of Operation Ivy. The drums are crisp, background vocals silky smooth, bass is perfectly relaxed, and horns sound clean, pure and clear. Unlike a great deal of recent music from Jamaica, absolutely nothing is Auto-Tuned. The band, the Engine Room, is incredibly, wonderfully tight, sounding as if they'd just walked out of the 1960s and Coxsone Dodd's Studio One on some tracks and 1970s Channel One (home to the legendary Sly and Robbie) on others. And yes, there are some punky moments, but they are perfectly positioned-- such as in the rootsy, surf-guitar littered ""Bang"". </p>
<p class=""p2"">The album kicks off with the bouncy and poppy, politically pointed ""World Upside Down"", which could easily replace ""You Can Get It If You Really Want"" as the opening tune to <i>The Harder They Come</i>, the film that introduced Jimmy Cliff and, arguably, reggae to the world way back in 1972. It's been 40 years since Perry Henzell's landmark film, but Cliff couldn't sound more present. <i>Rebirth </i>is a theatrical piece of work, with Cliff telling stories, chatting about revolution, providing falsetto interludes, and even sometimes shouting. There's a level of excitement here that continues throughout the album—an excitement about just how great reggae music can be. Again, although retro, this isn't a revitalization, but rather a reminder that tiny Jamaica's musical legacy continues. </p>
<p class=""p2"">The recent release of the lovingly crafted, Kevin MacDonald-directed <i>Marley</i>, in which well-worn <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2980-bob-marley-the-wailers/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Marley and the Wailers</a> tracks sounded as urgent as ever provided 2012 listeners with a heads up: The sound of bare-bones reggae can still be goosebump-inducingly powerful. Cliff, the man who originally took Bob Marley to the studio, provides a strong, soaring vocal on ""One More""-- yet another example of reggae that provokes shivers. As a song that expresses the very need to keep singing, it's no surprise that there are two versions on the record-- one that takes ska as its starting point and another that builds an even more driving rhythm, but ends the whole album with an anthemic, sing-along flourish that seems to encourage the audience to continue even after it's over. It's difficult not to picture a crowd jumping up and down, begging Cliff for an encore.</p>
<p class=""p2"">""Outsider"", which dabbles in straight-up 1960s-style American R&amp;B, offers a tip of the hat to the sound that influenced so many Jamaican musicians in the early days of reggae. It's just the kind of track to keep that party going. Repainting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/771-the-clash/"" target=""_blank"">the Clash</a>'s ""Guns of Brixton"" with a touch of dub and Rancid's ""Ruby Soho"" with a lilting ska approach makes these tracks more than covers. Like ""Outsider"", they're additional musical history lessons, teaching that both the energy and the sound of punk rock-- whether based in London or Berkeley-- connects directly back to Jamaica. </p>
<p class=""p2"">And, as Jamaica edges toward its 50th anniversary as an independent nation on August 6, there's been much talk about how the country wants to represent itself on the world stage. Arguments abound about whether ""On a Mission"", the Shaggy-produced, techno-influenced song should be the official song of Jamaica 50 versus Mikey Bennett's more traditional (but strangely salsa tinged) reggae track ""Find the Flag"". It's too bad no one consulted Jimmy Cliff. <i>Rebirth</i>, as an album, is a perfect companion to Jamaica's independence. It reaches back to the era of ska, travels through the era of rockers and roots reggae, and demonstrates the power of the music today. Don't let anyone tell you that dancehall has fully taken over-- any soundsystem worth its salt knows that it must always pay respect to the foundation, to reggae. </p>
<p class=""p2"">On ""Reggae Music"", Cliff makes it crystal clear. He recounts the famous story of recording his first tune at Beverley's-- Leslie Kong's ice cream parlor/recording studio on Orange Street, Kingston-- in 1962. Taking it from there, he then runs down the history of reggae over the past fifty years since independence, making it all the way to the present day, declaring that ""Now 2012 reggae music is still here as the voice of people everywhere."" It's certainly not oldies Jimmy Cliff is singing. And we should all be glad he don't have no other job.  </p></div>"|16885.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16885-rebirth/|7.5|Erin Macleod

It was early in their career, and the support slot was early in the evening, causing only a faithful few to witness the event. Anyone close to the stage at the beginning of the show was nervously pinned to the back wall by the end of it, so severe were the waves of noise surging across the mostly empty room. At times it felt like they were filling the space with something tangible, adding a touch of thickness to the air that buttressed up against you. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a> pull off a similar trick during the breakdown section of ""You Made Me Realise"", where it feels like the atmosphere is gradually decaying around you in direct correlation to the increase in intensity. It's no wonder that Benjamin John Power, one half of Fuck Buttons, has built a haven of sorts from his central band, pushing his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29644-blanck-mass/"">Blanck Mass</a> project into a similarly immeasurable glut of space while dialing down the reliance on punishing volume. </p>
<p>The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15572-blanck-mass/""><i>Blanck Mass</i></a> album of last year took a circuitous journey into contemplation, where notes and figures looped in perpetuity, just holding back from driving Power's audience into a soporific stupor. In a sense, it wasn't so different from his work as part of Fuck Buttons, with both projects requiring a keen understanding of exactly how to lull the listener into a subtle state of hypnosis without ever breaking the spell. It's a tough act to pull off-- anyone working primarily in repetition is always in danger of falling prey to their own indulgence, but Power has proven to be a skilled and deeply intuitive editor. This two-track 12"" for the ever-expanding <a href=""http://www.mexicansummer.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mexican Summer</a> is a further refinement of everything that has come before, with another colossal sweep of space providing home to a series of motifs that ebb and flow over a collected 21-minute runtime. </p>
<p>Here, Power has taken the Blanck Mass sound and carved shards of light into it. There's nothing that resembles the mesh of agrarian textures and shimmering electronics of ""Sub Serious"" from <i>Blanck Mass</i>; nor is there the same kind of untethered drift into beat-less splendor of ""What You Know"" and ""Sifted Gold"". Instead, this is a surprise move closer to his work with Fuck Buttons, feeling like a half step back to that band without fully committing to its fondness for abject terror. Both songs act like twins to one another, operating in similar sound worlds and requiring close inspection to determine their individual nuances. It's reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26146-sabres-of-paradise/"">the Sabres of Paradise</a> circa the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcKTf_FKKDU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Smokebelch II""</a> single, a record made by Fuck Buttons collaborator <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5864-andrew-weatherall/"">Andrew Weatherall</a> during a time where it felt like he was enamored with knotting up pop structures with more out-there fare like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1348-cluster/"">Cluster</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6251-silver-apples/"">Silver Apples</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24001-king-tubby/"">King Tubby</a>. Power might balk at the use of ""pop"" to describe this release, but it's certainly his sunniest output to date.</p>
<p>But that's only half the story, as both ""White Math"" and ""Polymorph"" bear deep-bass undertows that pull them close to the world <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7210-geoff-barrow/"">Geoff Barrow</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30418-ben-salisbury/"">Ben Salisbury</a> created for their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16600-drokk-music-inspired-by-mega-city-one/""><i>DROKK</i></a> project earlier this year. The world's synthesizers may groan in agony at hearing use of the ""John Carpenter"" preset once again, but it's difficult to escape that comparison when the intro to ""White Math"" begins and the image of <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082340/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Snake Plissken</a> running down rainy post-apocalyptic streets sears into your synapses. Fortunately, Power uses that only as a tool to get to where he's going instead of fixing it as his entire milieu. The ascending synth lines in ""Polymorph"" even sound like a half cousin to Fuck Buttons' euphoric ""Olympians"", and it's in that huge surge of energy that Power so often finds his greatest strength. It's granite-like in feel, but also bursting with opulent, Arcadian splendor, making it feel like he's creating his own strain of technological utopianism.</p></div>"|16930.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16930-white-math-polymorph/|7.4|Nick Neyland

Hip-hop production has always had time for bass and bombast but a growing number of producers-- notably Lex Luger, the often copied but rarely equalled soundbomber behind Waka's influential <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14771-flockaveli/"" target=""_blank""><i>Flockaveli</i></a>-- have an almost nihilistic embrace of sonic overkill. </p>
<p style=""color: #222222;"">TNGHT may not come from the American rap scene (Lunice is in Montreal, while HudMo's Ross Birchard is based in Glasgow), but their connection to it is clear. Lunice and Birchard have great ears for what's what and who's making it: their engaging and well-curated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47186-tnght-new-track-higher-ground-waka-flocka-flame-remix-guest-mix-for-diplos-bbc-show/"" target=""_blank"">hour-long mix</a> for Diplo's BBC show ranged from the mush-mouthed grit of Florida's Spaceghostpurrp to Chicago's recent wave of teenage antagonism (Chief Keef, Sasha Go Hard) without showing any signs of dilettantism.</p>
<p style=""color: #222222;"">Their self-titled debut EP for Warp and LuckyMe spans 16 minutes of some of the year's most brazen, positively huge hip-hop sounds. Birchard recently <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8868-tnght/"" target=""_blank"">copped</a> to Pitchfork that inspiration usually hits him when he's on the couch, but this is no DIY laptop affair: HudMo and Lunice took to a high-end London studio to bang out these five cuts, and the results sound properly expensive. </p>
<p style=""color: #222222;"">Ironically, they arrived at this point by process of subtraction. Where something like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13260-jump-out/"" target=""_blank"">Gunplay's ""Jump Out""</a> crams well over a hundred SFX triggers into its short runtime, creating the kind of sonic swarm that threatens to swallow itself, TNGHT's take on post-Luger smash-and-bash drama is clean and precise. The simplicity is deceptive next to the record's volume, and its minimalist approach, rounding off every seismic charge with a futuristic crispness that recalls Timbaland's game-changing creative peak.</p>
<p style=""color: #222222;"">Another revelation dropped in that TNGHT interview is that there are yet-to-be-named MCs locked to spit over every single track on this EP some time in the future. It's a promising development, considering that their remix of Waka's recent single ""Rooster in My Rari"", which pulls off the four-leaf-clover achievement of actually making a Flocka single <i>louder</i>-- proves that Lunice and HudMo's wordless bombs retain their effectiveness with rappers on them.</p>
<p style=""color: #222222;"">On their own, though, a keen sense of structure lifts <i>TNGHT</i>'s productions above purely functional beat-tape grooves. The breadth of carnage on the EP's centerpiece, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13891-higher-ground/"" target=""_blank"">""Higher Ground""</a>, starts with looped handclaps and vocal samples and quickly ascends to martial-law status as a synthesized tuba pops in and out to steamroll buildings just for laughs. And ""Goooo""'s tight tonal coils sound like hot knives slashing through metal by its high-anxiety conclusion. </p>
<p style=""color: #222222;"">""[They] rarely work out,"" Birchard told us last month, regarding teaming up with others in the production world. ""I've done loads of collaborations and I'm never totally happy with the outcome because it feels like you're compromising something of yourself in it."" What's most impressive about TNGHT's sound, then, is how effortlessly cohesive and <i>them</i> it sounds. Those whose ears have been close to the ground over the past three years know that both HudMo and Lunice's solo work shares more than a LuckyMe affiliation-- specifically, heavy-thudded bass rhythms, splashes of synth color, and a fun-first approach to melodic phrasing indebted to dance and R&amp;B alike. Separately, they compliment each other, but together, they finish each other's sentences with exclamation points in bold, underlined, 72-point type. Since the EP's completion, HudMo and Lunice have been at work on individual solo albums, but their partnership has already yielded results so impressive and of-the-moment that it's likely we haven't heard the last of it.</p></div>"|16854.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16854-tnght-ep/|8.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

The ongoing marriage of accessible songwriting and capital-A Artistry may very well be both a cause <i>and</i> a symptom of that which was once called indie rock's growing popularity. On a purely aesthetic level, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27685-micachu/"" target=""_blank"">Micachu and the Shapes</a> could stand among this generation's most lauded arty pop purveyors. But with this, their second album proper (following last year's one-off collaboration with the London Sinfonietta, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15274-chopped-screwed/"" target=""_blank""><i>Chopped and Screwed</i></a>), the band has doubled down on something genuinely different, defiantly cold, and intentionally withholding.</p>
<p class=""p1"">These qualities were certainly present on the band's 2009 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12922-jewellery/"" target=""_blank""><i>Jewellery</i></a>, but they were tempered by much more discernibly ""pop"" moments. The album was chock full of strange noises and unconventional structures, but these were masterfully interwoven with catchy melodies and conventionally exhilarating rhythms. This time around, it's all but impossible to hear the band's cacophonous sonic treatments and counterintuitive structures as things that are being <i>done</i> to a batch of songs-- they <i>are</i> the songs. One can hardly picture the three humans in the band actually <i>playing</i> this music, and it's hard to tell a treated guitar from a vacuum cleaner or a drum kit from some clangorous but impossible-to-visualize percussive texture. </p>
<p class=""p1"">In keeping with the album's title, <i>Never</i> is uncompromising and direct. While both of Micachu's albums feel like the work of impossibly cool, perpetually unimpressed British art students, this attitude is the brilliant, bloodless core of <i>Never</i>. The whiffs of boredom and casual disdain that passed through <i>Jewellery</i> no longer read as a crack at style. In some ways, it's easier to approach <i>Never</i> as a single piece of music than as a collection of unrelated songs. There are no clear points of entry here, nothing that stands out quite as strongly as <i>Jewellery</i>'s ""Calculator"" or ""Wrong"". Mica Levi's melodies are minimal and straightforward, but <i>Never</i> finds them constantly obfuscated and/or disrupted. Would-be memorable vocal lines are mumbled, manipulated, and cut off. Entire songs seem imperceptibly to slow down or lurch forward. This is decidedly uneasy listening, in an unerringly precise and purposeful way.</p>
<p class=""p1"">None of which is to say that <i>Never</i> is without nuance or subtlety. The theatrical call-and-response of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13727-ok/"" target=""_blank"">""Ok""</a> may be sincerely expressing the importance of directly communicating one's emotions, or dryly, brutally lampooning it. The most conventionally pretty segment of <i>Never</i> is a spare, 47-second set piece with flutes and bird sounds that concludes, ""I want to jump into the white sky/ But I never try."" It is extremely rare to hear music that is so clever, but so thoroughly disinterested in drawing attention to its own cleverness.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In the grand tradition of art that willfully denies conventional pleasures, <i>Never </i>has a bit of trouble fully realizing its unconventional ones. It is nearly impossible to get anything from <i>Never</i> stuck in your head; the album's ideas and execution are so closely intertwined that it practically ceases to exist when you aren't actually <i>listening</i> to it. It is a singular object forged from absence, dissonance, flat surfaces, and sharp edges-- a brave and tricky step down a path that terminates somewhere more elemental and holistic than ""experimental pop music"" or ""catchy experimental music.""</p></div>"|16849.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16849-never/|7.3|Matt LeMay

Since their 2010 self-titled EP, the Roanoke, Virginia, duo (which recently became a trio) has been writing melodic, minimalist tunes about rules, rebellion, and first loves that conjure the bratty sweetness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3263-the-pastels/"" target=""_blank"">the Pastels</a> or the lilting noise-pop of Henry's Dress. They called their songs things like ""Prisoner"", ""Cog"", and ""Disciplinarian"". That last one kicked off their spirited but spotty 2010 album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14962-silver/"" target=""_blank"">Silver</a></i>: a fiery, one-and-a-half minute pop temper tantrum throughout which Nicole Yun flaunted the titular polysyllable like a 10-dollar word she'd overheard at the grown-ups' table. ""I think it's high time I had a disciplinarian,"" she sneered. ""The kind who tells me why I should follow the rules again."" The taut, post-punk jerk of the verse locked her lyrics into a staccato rhythm, but when the chorus came it was like summer vacation: She threw her head back and wailed.</p>
<p>As its title implies, their new record, <i>Correct Behavior</i>, is also animated by that familiar but innocent strain of anarchy-- a distain for dumb rules and a desire to escape the mundane. ""Who could understand you?"" Yun hollers on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13701-wonder/"" target=""_blank"">""Wonder""</a>, a wickedly angsty, brooding-in-the-bedroom anthem. ""Mom and Dad, please/ You can never enter/ Shut the back door."" Miraculously, although the band members are all now around 30, their commitment to exploring these conflicts never feels awkward, stale, or even particularly juvenile: Their emotional immediacy and depth of feeling grows with each album. With its lush, pearly guitar tones and violin accompaniment, the lead-off track, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13536-millions/"" target=""_blank"">""Millions""</a>, is the fullest-sounding thing they've ever done, but its refrain is classic Eternal Summers: ""I've got to shake this shell and break it into millions."" <i>Correct Behavior</i> feels like the band's breakout album, and not just because it showcases a bigger sound-- but for the much more literal reason that a lot of these songs are about breaking out.</p>
<p>Rebelling against mom and dad is one thing, but breaking free of the limits you've imposed on your own identity is trickier. Up until now, the most widely reported part of the Eternal Summers story has been their involvement with something called the Magic Twig Community, a group of musicians living in the mountains of Roanoke who all play in each others' bands, record each others' albums with vintage gear, and exist far outside the steady churn of the hype machine. In a way, <i>Correct Behavior</i> is the band's first attempt to break out of this sphere, too-- though with a bit of hesitation. They recorded the tracks (analog) in Roanoke, and then they sent the tapes north to New York to be mixed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3531-the-raveonettes/"" target=""_blank"">Ravonettes</a> frontman Sune Rose Wagner and producer Alonzo Vargas (the pair also worked their reverby magic on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27600-dum-dum-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Dum Dum Girls</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15851-dum-dum-girls-only-in-dreams/"" target=""_blank""><i>Only in Dreams</i></a>). Having kept it lo-fi for so long, Yun and Daniel Cundiff both confessed that the move made them nervous, like they were giving up control.</p>
<p>The result could have been too large a leap, but Wagner and Vargas' production strikes a comfortable balance between the warmth and intimacy of the band's earlier work and a more expanded sound. The slow songs on <i>Silver</i> often lagged, but here they're some of the best: The dreamy crooners ""Good as You"" and ""It's Easy"" have enough atmosphere to get lost in. Cundiff's hyperactive drumming is rocket fuel for the more post-punk influenced songs like ""You Kill"" and ""Girls in the City"" (a moody, modish track on which he sings lead), and the addition of Jonathan Woods on bass frees Yun up to become a much more engaging guitarist-- check her meteorite riffage on ""You Kill"". The trio sounds huge, and that feeling of liberation they've always sung about is, finally, something you feel viscerally in their music.</p>
<p>Not every moment of <i>Correct Behavior</i> is as exhilarating as its opening four-song run. ""Disappear"" and ""Heaven and Hell"" weigh down the second half not so much because they're bad songs, but because they don't take the record any place it hasn't already been. And, though ""Girls in the City"" is a high point, Cundiff's deadpan vocals are such a departure from Yun's that the song feels tacked on, as if they haven't found a way to incorporate Cundiff's songs into their overall aesthetic. Still, these are spaces for improvement for a band obviously interested, as <i>Correct Behavior</i> proves, in upping its game. It's a step towards maturity, but in this case growing up just means growing louder-- busting through the bedroom ceiling and sounding that much closer to the sky.</p></div>"|16772.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16772-correct-behavior/|7.6|Lindsay Zoladz

It was his second update ever, following a repost of an article from the <i><a href=""http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/john-maus-hearing-gregorian-plainchant-in-new-wave/?smid=tw-nytmag&amp;seid=auto"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New York Times Magazine</a></i> that discussed his use of medieval modes as structural inspiration for his superficially 1980s-sounding, synth-pop power anthems. Considering the kaleidoscope of period influences that his own forward-looking pop can entail, it's hard to know exactly what Maus meant by ""the future."" The cover of <a href=""http://garywar.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gary War</a>'s third LP, like Maus' comment, conjures the idea of a high-minded, rock'n'roll Robocop, ricocheting heroically across a metropolis that has been reduced to a smog-laden wasteland by the ravages of human self-interest. Designed by Robert Beatty, who has done some album covers for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28895-la-big-vic/"" target=""_blank"">my own band</a>, the record's helmeted mascot feels like a distinctly backward-looking vision of the future, mid-way between cyberpunk hero and Apollo 11 passenger. </p>
<p>Of course, there's always the suspicion that a more sinister breed of vigilante might be peering out at us from behind the mirror surface of that visor-- especially when you're familiar with the darkly colored, almost maniacally acrobatic compositional style that Gary War, né Greg Dalton, has been honing under the moniker since the late 1990s. A former member of Ariel Pink's live band (with John Maus) and the founder of Brooklyn's <a href=""http://fixedidentity.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fixed Identity</a> records (with Taylor Richardson), Dalton didn't find a more official outlet for his home-recorded amalgam of experimental punk, synth tweakery, progressive rock, and distressed club beats until the late 2000s, when he began putting out his first 7""s, EPs, and full-lengths on labels like Sacred Bones and Captured Tracks. Like Ariel, he could be said to have an unusual knack for changing time signatures, counterintuitive melodies, and lo-fi textural play. But where Ariel's perversion of pop expectation feels celebratory and nonchalant, Gary War's has always felt a bit more manic and claustrophobic to me, as though he were trapped inside his own accidental-rich labyrinths, frantically trying to strum his way <i>out</i> of them.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Lyrically, <i>Jared’s Lot</i> probably has a lot more in common with the romantic hyperbole of John Maus, veering between absolutes of light and dark, good and evil, doomsday scenarios and the belief that love can help one find one's way out of them. On the high velocity, endlessly bleeping opener ""Thousand Yard Stare"", he begins an album-long negotiation between the dream of companionship and the pain of abandonment, following up some words of post-break-up hopelessness with the insight that ""life's fucked, then you live a little more."" Elsewhere, as on the very punk rock ""Pleading for Annihilation"", the existential extremes come to head with the intimation that the titular ""Jared"", or perhaps the Gary War character himself, would like to ""[leave] this evil world behind"" completely. But in keeping with the adage that when you hit rock bottom, you have nowhere to go but up, he admits in the same song that ""we know it's a place where our minds can begin. In year zero, start over again.""</p>
<p>Of course, you have to try pretty hard to make out what he is singing most of the time. Just as most representations of ""the future"" tend to involve some merging of man and machine, Gary War's dystopian sound-scapes involve no small variety of vocal effects, from the T-Pain-style autotune of ""Thousand Yard Stare"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13674-superlifer/"" target=""_blank"">""Superlifer""</a> to the pitched-down gravitas of his voice on ""Advancements in Disgust"" and ""Pleading for Annihilation"". Beyond the sensation that the album's protagonist is pulling some mind-bending, Transformers-style metamorphosis at every turn, his jam-packed arrangements seem to do the same thing. <i>Jared's Lot</i> showcases some of his cleanest-sounding production to date, and the richer resolution makes it all the more apparent just how many hours he must having spent layering arpeggio over arpeggio, counter-melody over melody, phaser effect over phaser effect. Tune in to ""Find Our Way"", one my personal favorites, and you'll hear a rhythmically uncountable bassline tarry with a synth melody that steps out of its own key more than it stays inside it. You'd probably have to sit in front of a piano to figure out how it all works, but that doesn't mean that the song doesn't settle into an undeniably catchy groove; it just defines ""groove"" using its own idiosyncratic parameters. </p>
<p>Recently, on a website I helped found, John Maus offered up a <a href=""http://adhoc.fm/post/re-dear-john-maus-how-are-you/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lengthy explanation</a> of his Gary War claim that even went pretty deep into the harmonic logic (or anti-logic) of his note progressions. The point he seemed to be trying to make, overall, was that Gary War makes pop music that all but completely undermines the rules of pop itself. Of course, as Maus himself allows, you probably don't have to be fluent in ""'lead sheet' vocabulary"" to come away with that conclusion, or to appreciate the fact that there is way too much going on inside this album than you can digest in a single sitting. If you can get past the need for Gary War's melodies to resolve in the way that you <i>expect</i> them to, and allow your ear to follow whatever warped texture or crazy synth modulation it feels most attracted to at any given moment, this masterfully constructed album can be as fun to navigate (and as deeply psychedelic) as a Choose Your Own Adventure tale.</p></div>"|16850.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16850-jareds-lot/|7.3|Emilie Friedlander

And on <i>Eremita</i>, his latest album under his longtime stage name, Ihsahn opens with ""Arrival"", ends with ""Departure"", and makes requisite narrative-arc stops at ""Introspection"", ""Grief"", and ""Catharsis"". As with most of Ihsahn's work, there's an appreciable influence of classical music at the core, so that the record moves more like a feature-length presentation than a string of unconnected assaults. Whether that means synthesizer interludes or bits of field recordings lacing the edges of these long, layered songs, <i>Eremita</i> bears all the necessary sigils of a <i>very serious</i> metal album. </p>
<p>Still, even if unintentionally, it's also kind of goofy and fun. Those qualities are apparent at that start, when sampled sounds and ambient noise instantly give way to a rapidfire guitar riff and a beefy organ tone more familiar from progressive rock. Ihsahn squawks his way through the verses, but he hands the chorus-- a massive, arena-rock inlet about giving up or going on-- to Einar Solberg, who treats it a bit like an Evanescence refrain. That's not even an insult. There's a hyperkinetic guitar solo, a little duet exchange between Ihsahn and Solberg, and a mellow-out moment just ahead of a flameout coda; it's tawdry and awesome, strangely complementary qualifiers that fit the bulk of<i> Eremita</i>. ""Introspection"", for instance, oscillates between tense tech-metal stretches and languid, acoustic-led drifts (with, no less, hand drums), and the hyperbolic juxtaposition mostly makes each part that much more ridiculous and enjoyable. </p>
<p>If last year was indie rock's time with the saxophone, Napalm Death and Ihsahn have now swiped that brassy mantle for heavy metal: Jorgen Munkeby of wild-eyed Norwegian ensemble Shining adds horns to the nine-minute ""The Eagle and Snake"", a gloriously restless epic that makes time for death-metal stomp, a spiraling solo from guitarist Jeff Loomis, brooding military marches, and two stretches of saxophone shrapnel that raise the wager of this year's earlier John Zorn and Napalm Death pairing. And though ""Catharsis"" first feigns intentions as a scowling, slinking interlude with Munkeby weaving Middle Eastern melodies beneath Ihsahn's raspy voice, the song soon morphs into piano-backed pop. The saxophone serves as textural ballast, supporting the melody as though this were a slab of Laurel Canyon album-rock. On a record of constant misdirection and omnipresent unpredictability, it's a subtle affirmation that, no matter if he's trading in black metal or dealing out Pentangle-like rock, Ihsahn is a thorough, savvy arranger. </p>
<p>The final track-- yes, ""Departure""-- opens with horn sighs and hightails alternately into mid-tempo rock'n'roll and a near-grindcore blitz. It ends rather dramatically with a soliloquy sung by Ihsahn's wife and longtime collaborator, Heidi S. Tveitan; think Sigur Rós spliced between bits of modern rock radio. If you've tracked Ihsahn's career at all, this sort of irreverence and integration likely comes as little news. Remember, despite their foundational role in both the musical and extracurricular priorities of Scandinavian black metal, that band tested the limits of its own style and standards for the last two decades, both for better and worse; and that's just the sliver of Ihsahn's career for which he's best known. But <i>Eremita</i> feels not only particularly unbridled but exceptionally rewarding, too, with most of its twists and tangents working as near-complete surprises. In the last few years, many of those central to the second wave of black metal have <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Immortal-All-Shall-Fall/master/188805"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">retrenched with orthodoxy</a> or traded in corpsepaint for <a href=""http://www.burzum.org/img/gallery11/big/photo102.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">something somehow sillier</a>. Here, Ihsahn occasionally reveals his more savage roots while succeeding by and large with shocking routes. Sure, maybe <i>Eremita</i> is sometimes awkward, chintzy, or melodramatic, but for 52 minutes, Ihsahn mostly allows the listener to have a blast, if occasionally and arguably at his own expense.  </p></div>"|16888.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16888-eremita/|7.6|Grayson Currin

There wasn't much information about them out there; they had a member that used to be in something called Gobble Gobble, which momentarily seemed notable. But everything you needed to know was contained in the song itself. It mixed the kind of ghostly pitch-shifted vocals, reminiscent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2378-the-knife/"" target=""_blank"">the Knife</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"" target=""_blank"">Burial</a>, that had spent the previous year haunting witch house; it had warped, surging, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_parent"">Dilla</a>-derived synth chords that popular online remixers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28980-star-slinger/"" target=""_blank"">Star Slinger</a> were on the verge of turning into a cliché. And it had the stuttering start-stop drum machine patterns that highlighted how much the pulse of Southern rap had invaded indie music the last few years. But where these production touches were often held up as ends in themselves, ""Ungirthed"" was a well-constructed and fully realized pop song, with an infectious vocal hook and a melody that went places. This was novel. It was the kind of tune you took notice of immediately.</p>
<p>Eventually we learned that ""Ungirthed"" was the work of Megan James (vocals) and Corin Roddick (production), two young musicians from Edmonton, Alberta. Wisely, they didn't rush out an album, but other songs trickled out: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12302-belispeak/"" target=""_blank"">""Belispeak""</a> surfaced in the fall and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13509-obedear/"" target=""_blank"">""Obedear""</a> emerged this spring. Along the way, Purity Ring polished up their live show, outfitting the stage with lanterns synchronized to the music, which Roddick triggered via MIDI using drumsticks. They built an audience with very little recorded music to share with it. And now, a year and a half later, they've issued their debut album, <i>Shrines</i>.</p>
<p>Since those early singles all mined such similar sounds, it was an open question how Purity Ring might mix things up over the course of an 11-song, 38-minute full-length. But <i>Shrines</i> is not about range, instead offering subtly different versions of a single, near-perfect idea. You might think of the album as a sculpture, and each track offers a different vantage point. ""Ungirthed"" is how you see it head on; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13781-fineshrine/"" target=""_blank"">""Fineshrine""</a> is what it looks like from a low angle, with a bit of shadow from the overhang providing an extra touch of darkness; ""Crawlersout"", with its sharper percussive edges and extra portion of ghosted vocals, is the view from 90 degrees to the left; and then ""Grandloves"", with unwelcome guest vocals from Isaac Emmanuel of Young Magic, is like having a guy standing between you and the work, and he won't stop talking on his cell. ""Grandloves"" is the one moment in which Purity Ring seem common, but that's one truly weak song out of 11. Not a bad ratio for a new band. And the consistent quality makes it easy to forgive the feeling that occasionally creeps in the first few times you hear the album straight through: ""Didn't I just hear this one a couple of minutes ago?"" </p>
<p>A quality that further elevates <i>Shrines</i> is the lyrics, and that's something that could be easily missed, since James' vocals are often heavily processed. They, too, offer variations on a theme. ""Sea water's flowing from the middle of my thighs,"" are the first words we here on the opening track, ""Crawlersout"", and the focus on the body never lets up. From ""Dig holes in me with wooden carved trowels,"" on ""Grandloves"" to ""The crawling animals will seek all things warm all things moist, I will relentlessly shame myself,"" on ""Saltkin"", the words are impressionistic but always come back to sweat, skin, and bones. Fluids ooze in sympathy with the chords; hearts are given away by being ripped from ribcages. The lyrics are vivid and striking, even if it takes some work to parse them out. And the contrast between their bloody earthiness and music born of 1s and 0s gives the record an appealing push/pull and provides the album with some additional staying power. These songs, so instantly catchy, have more to offer over time. </p>
<p>The band that Purity Ring most reminds me of is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5373-high-places/"" target=""_blank"">High Places</a>. The dubbed-out retro-futuristic approach to sound, the male/female duo, the connection to the earlier iterations of indie pop, the experiments with live spectacle. And High Places also emerged more or less fully formed, with the singles and EPs collected on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11150-0307-0907/"" target=""_blank""><i>03/07 - 09/07</i></a> pulling together <i>au courant</i> influences into something that felt personal and new. But ever since, High Places have had some difficulty figuring out where to go next. Once you own a sound and make it your own, it's not always easy to leave it behind. We'll see how that plays out with Purity Ring. For now, the compulsively listenable <i>Shrines</i> stands quite well on its own. Most bands never manage a statement this forceful.</p></div>"|16851.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16851-shrines/|8.4|Mark Richardson

Two things stood out: While they were hardly the only indie rock band at the time showing love to 90s R&amp;B hits, they didn't approach it with anything resembling irony or cred-consciousness, and thus were one of the few who didn't completely embarrass themselves. Secondly, while keeping its core intact, they still managed to make it sound like a Fang Island song. This was a genuine revelation-- <i>Fang Island </i>was stuffed with so many triple-guitar harmonies, shouted group vocals and octopus-armed drum fills that the dearth of traditional songcraft came off like a necessary casualty rather than a deficiency. <i>Fang Island </i>initially felt like a single idea perfected, ""celebration rock"" before <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16564-japandroids-celebration-rock/"" target=""_blank""><i>Celebration Rock </i></a>(right down to the fireworks that began and ended the record). But now that they're edging their way into real-deal songwriting on <i>Major</i>, we get to see whether they were in any way holding back on us.</p>
<p><i>Major</i> isn't as much of a change as you might expect-- their compositional method takes more cues from something like <i>Fang Island</i>'s ""Life Coach"" than ""Always Be My Baby"", which is admittedly something of a letdown if <i>Major </i>was intended as a progression rather than a lateral movement. There are no big personal disclosures, narrative ambitions, or political causes on <i>Major</i>, nor are they revealing themselves as masterful architects of baroque song structure<i>. </i>Rather, Fang Island write vocal melodies and lyrics the same way they write riffs, simple yet very enthusiastic smile-triggers that are designed to be doubled and tripled for effect. A line like ""I hope I never understand"" fits into Fang Island's worldview not just as a philosophy but because it simply <i>sounds </i>like the words that should be accompanying ascending and descending notes of a major key scale. </p>
<p>Though they aren't firebrands like fellow Rhode Island School of Design alum <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"" target=""_blank"">David Byrne</a>, it's helpful to remember that Fang Island are art-school kids in a band that is to an extent an art project. They're just one with an unusual attitude, which is that happiness is every bit as complex and multifarious as the darkness and depression most of their peers choose to explore. And <i>Major </i>comes off as so chipper that it's tough to trust sometimes. There's no reason to doubt their sincerity-- the first repeated line from <i>Major </i>is ""all I know, I learned in kindergarten"" and if that doesn't clear the room, you'll stick around for similar sentiments like ""I'll probably never under-- I hope I never understand,"" ""you're making me work for it,"" and ""I want to seek out the angles."" These songs wake up with the sun, eat a well-balanced breakfast, go running before they check their Twitter feed and make a plan to talk to that standoffish guy at the gym and make a friend today.</p>
<p>It's a standard of admirable positivity that you can still resent the everloving shit out of because it feels impossible to live up to. And ultimately, <i>Major's </i>reliance on words rather than riffs doesn't quite feel as effective or unique in conveying its highness on life. It doesn't sound notably more polished or expensive than its predecessor, just more restrained. Whereas songs like ""Daisy"" and ""Careful Crossers"" sounded like they could veer out of control from a compositional standpoint, <i>Major </i>comes equipped with brakes and airbags. Instrumentals like ""Chompers"" have no shortage of hotshot riffs, yet they end up in about the same place they started-- and if they're going to mine a fairly narrow emotional vein, they either need to overwhelm or make more of stylistic range. ""Dooney Rock"" is agreeable country-rock corndoggin' and the most notable detour, but when they do stretch their legs on ""Make Me"" or ""Never Understand"", they simply outstay their welcome through repetition, pushing five minutes and tamped down by flat and dry production you could typically find on records reining in your favorite indie acts in the mid-90s.</p>
<p>Fortunately, like <i>Too High to Die </i>or <i>Without a Sound </i>or <i>File Under: Easy Listening</i>, <i>Major </i>would've been a Buzz Bin record with some hits-- the downstroked, palm-muted riffs of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13614-asunder/"" target=""_blank"">""Asunder""</a> puts itself in the lineage of Jimmy Eat World's ""The Middle"", to this day, the finest alt-rock pep talk put to tape. Elsewhere, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13742-sisterly/"" target=""_blank"">""Sisterly""</a> trades heroic leads with the finest use of non-funk wah-wah pedal in ages, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13832-seek-it-out/"" target=""_blank"">""Seek It Out""</a> merges Fang Island's up-with-people mentality with post-punk's brutal stop/start dynamics. The frontloaded sequencing of <i>Major </i>frames it as running out of ideas, but it's better to think of it as a transitional record more than one which brings up the question as to whether their technical shredding can ever coexist with pure pop-rock in the first place.</p>
<p>But maybe what <i>Major</i> lacks compared to its predecessor is the element of surprise, and it's not just in a musical sense. Even though they'd been gigging around for several years and <i>Fang Island </i>was consistently misidentified as <a href=""http://fangisland.bandcamp.com/album/day-of-the-great-leap"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their debut</a> instead of their sophomore LP, it basically still felt it like came out of nowhere and only a bolt from the blue could inspire such instantaneous cartwheeling, bouncing off walls, high-fiving everyone in the room. It's the reason they got compared to Andrew W.K. rather than similarly situated art-shredders like the Mae Shi or Ponytail. <i>Major </i>does actually confirm that comparison since it's very similar to <i>I Get Wet</i>'s followup <i>The Wolf</i>, ultimately more refined, more proper, and modestly asking for staying power rather than demanding that you party til you puke.</p></div>"|16852.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16852-major/|6.9|Ian Cohen

Six years later, when pets.com was put down by the dot-com bubble's burst, things looked bad. They got even worse eight years after that, when Wall Street's credit-default swaps turned American suburbs into ghettos. Nero fiddles, Rome burns, and all most are left to do is murmur ""dum dum dum dee dum dum dee-da-dee-da-dee,"" like Sadier at the end of ""Ping Pong"", waiting for the next volley to come over the net.</p>
<p>Marx's theory was proven right by our most recent financial crisis, so it's not too much of a shock that Sadier's second solo album for <a href=""http://www.dragcity.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Drag City</a>, <i>Silencio, </i>would mark a return to pop punditry after the more personal and straightforward pop of 2010's overlooked LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14660-the-trip/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Trip</i></a>. Don't expect the Occupy campers to wheel out the Moogs just yet, though: The impeccable cool of Sadier's approach freezes out political engagement in lieu of a brand of fashionable leftism to match the sofa. Robert Christgau once described Stereolab as ""Marxist background music,"" and Sadier's lyrics have always treated politics as another set of cultural symbols to work into fanciful new shapes.</p>
<p>Particularly in a year when the internet blew up at burgeoning lefty <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-vN4H4KBpA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Megan Draper chirping ""Zou Bisou Bisou"" to Don</a> during the ""Mad Men"" season premiere, <i>Silencio</i> feels as timelessly hip as a pair of Wayfarers or an Eames chair. The album matches Sadier's husky alto with lush synths, pretty melodies, and the occasional presence of a café-infused Latin-style acoustic strum that suggests a Wes Anderson-directed make-out scene. As always, Sadier works best when asking generic Big Questions that tip over into the surreal or absurd: picking the brain of her friend Sue the mathematician (in ""Find Me the Pulse of the Universe"") or eating jambon crudité and wondering about the gap between perception and reality (in ""Moi Sans Zach""), both presented with the breeziness of Jobim or early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4810-serge-gainsbourg/"" target=""_blank"">Gainsbourg</a>. The chicken-scratch mod-funk of ""Fragment pour le future de l'homme"" is a surprise highlight, nodding back toward Stereolab's pureéd guitars while lyrics promise a brighter future for a generation caught spinning its Vespa wheels.</p>
<p>That doesn't make those moments when the political theories overpower the songs themselves any easier to overlook, though. This wasn't a problem with the likes of Stereolab's ""Ping Pong"" or ""The Noise of Carpet"", both of which offered the choice of tuning out the message for the catchy tunes, or intellectually merging and deconstructing the two components instead of reading Derrida for the next day's critical theory seminar. But on <i>Silencio</i>, a song like ""There Is a Price for Freedom (And it Isn't Security)"" is a mouthful, the sort of slogan you'd expect to see on a leaflet foisted upon you on a college campus. The production strives for the sort of fauxchestral grandeur that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3993-super-furry-animals/"" target=""_blank"">Super Furry Animals</a> perfected on their own politically themed concept albums <i>Rings Around the World</i> and <i>Phantom Power</i>, but can't push past a groaner like ""Follower of conformity/ Happy to identify with a reflection in merchandise."" I'll spare you detailed quotes from ""Ausculatation to the Nation"", but just know that while the composition is fine enough, the lyrics are transcribed word for word from a caller's rant to a French political talk show. With this as a contrast point, it's best that the album ends with a Sadier spoken-word monologue, recorded in an old French church, during which she expounds on the resonant qualities of silence before letting the recorder pick up the tone of the cavernous, otherwise empty room.</p></div>"|16858.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16858-silencio/|6.8|Eric Harvey

That's not a criticism. If anything, one of the best compliments I can pay <i>Tipped Bowls</i> is that it sounds like ten albums I've heard before, but there's no single album that sounds just like it. It is pretty, tinkly, swirly and feels as though it's all taking place in something the size of a petri dish-- disco for microbes, maybe. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1547-four-tet/"" target=""_blank"">Four Tet</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13861-there-is-love-in-you/"" target=""_blank""><i>There Is Love in You</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28121-gold-panda/"" target=""_blank"">Gold Panda</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14732-lucky-shiner/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lucky Shiner</i></a>, elements of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2142-isolee/"" target=""_blank"">Isolée</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5179-the-field/"" target=""_blank"">the Field</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28459-mount-kimbie/"" target=""_blank"">Mount Kimbie</a>'s politely stunning 2009 EPs: They're all reference points, but none of them is copied so brashly that <i>Tipped Bowls</i> ever feels redundant. Think of it, then, as a frame for a style that has been floating around for a few years now but never organized so carefully: a testament to the ways artists can be almost as effective when curating familiar sounds as they can when trying to create something totally new.</p>
<p>Let's go back to small and pretty: If you do not like small and pretty, you will probably not like <i>Tipped Bowls</i>. When I say small and pretty, I mean it in a fairly conservative sense. Autumn leaves, porcelain tea sets, lace dresses, tropical fish, soap bubbles: <i>Tipped Bowls</i> is interested in these things, and not interested in making them any more complicated than they are. What saves it from sounding precious is the way in which it uses small, pretty things to create chaos. Tracks like ""Growing Forehead"" or my personal favorite, ""Ballibat"", are filled with high-wire moments when all the pops, fizzes, and scattering melodies feel like they're about to pull apart only to come back together again. The instability in the music is what makes it exciting. It's a strategy as old as jazz. The novelty here is scale: To an ant, falling confetti must look terrifying. Being small isn't the same as being cute-- a difference <i>Tipped Bowls</i> mines beautifully.</p>
<p>Certain tracks stand out, but one of the album's virtues is that it's all of a piece-- there's even a track broken into a ""Part 1"" and ""Part 2"" if you needed guidance on how to take it in. Nothing on it bangs, but nothing drifts, either-- even the ambient passages hinge on traditional tension and release. It's good home-listening music, and even better for a car or train commute that might highlight both its natural sense of motion and the way that motion shapes the album over 45 minutes.</p>
<p><i>Tipped Bowls</i> feels like a minor record, partially by design. It never grabs you by the throat. It never gives you something totally new to consider. It's also highly listenable, and has a way of slipping in through the side door that I admire. It's also probably Kompakt's best release in a while, and for them, a nice-- but appropriately small-- shift from the music they built their name on during the first part of the 2000s. Call it a victory; keep the ""v"" lowercase.</p></div>"|16738.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16738-tipped-bowls/|7.5|Mike Powell

The track, an obscure, surly post-punk offering, collides harshly with the proggy computer compositions that surround it. It's like being punched in a library: You peel yourself off the floor smelling must and blood. It's an interesting moment because this impulse-- to fuck things up, to jar and puncture-- is absent from Haley's recorded work. It's still missing on <i>In Decay</i>, a 13-track, digital-only, rarities compilation that finds a younger Haley asking little of his listeners or himself.</p>
<p>Most of the material on <i>In Decay</i> was recorded prior to Haley's 2011 debut LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15604-galactic-melt/"" target=""_blank""><i>Galactic Melt</i></a>. We can debate the utility of this type of release for a prolific, still-green producer, but that timeline is important because <i>In Decay</i> is deceptively underdeveloped. (The digital distribution, normally a great idea, chafes: Like many on the Ghostly roster, Haley has such a well-developed sense of design that his physical products are treats.) Haley so ably winds his synths into pleasing shapes that his compositions can sound complex when they're not. On <i>In Decay</i>, it's the drums that give him away: Respectful, grid-worshipping snares dominate almost every track, slapping against the more formed melodic ideas.</p>
<p>About those ideas: <i>In Decay</i> still leans heavily on dry-ice, low-cal funk. The tracks are baubles, pure sonic fetishes that that fail to provoke discernible imagery or mood beyond a noirish appreciation for the oscillators of Christmas past. Where <i>Galactic Melt</i> dipped its toes into dance music, <i>In Decay</i> hovers sluggishly in midtempo grooves (the engine rev of ""Klymaxx"" is a welcome diversion). In this mode, bass-heavy anthems like ""Data Kiss"" and ""Smily Cyclops"" offer the most to grasp.</p>
<p>The re-emergence of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/755-chromatics/"" target=""_blank"">Chromatics</a> (including Johnny Jewel side concern <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30141-symmetry/"" target=""_blank"">Symmetry</a>) and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14576-todd-terje/"" target=""_blank"">Todd Terje</a>'s hot streak-- among others-- mean that an already crowded field of 1980s analog revivalists has, shockingly, gotten more crowded. Cut Haley whatever slack you see fit for <i>In Decay</i>'s odds-and-sods status, but nothing here dispels the notion that his vision is more limited than that of many of his peers. He is a pure stylist, something his affinity for beautiful graphic design helps make clear, but if you're sitting behind a synthesizer in 2012 in the name of nostalgia, you'd better be able to use it to sharpen that style to a point. <i>In Decay</i> is too dull and passive to threaten.</p></div>"|16917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16917-in-decay/|5.6|Andrew Gaerig

So when Michael Angelakos sings, ""I'm so self-loathing that it's hard for me to see,"" that should come across like a tremendous understatement. But two lines later, he cries ""no one believes me, no not a single thing."" That part cuts deep, since Passion Pit's 2009 debut LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13169-manners/"" target=""_blank""><i>Manners</i></a>, was an often dark and troubled record a lot of people chose not to take seriously due to its sugar-smacked synth pop and countless product placements. So it's no wonder that Angelakos' next words are ""my brain is racing and I'll feel like I'll explode!"" Three difficult years in the making, <i>Gossamer</i> is an overwhelming album about being overwhelmed, a bold and ultimately stunning torrent of maximalist musical ideas, repressed anger, and unchecked anxiety.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's fitting that <i>Gossamer</i>, so focused on failure and human frailty, should begin with a stumble. ""Take a Walk"" is a fairly by-the-numbers Passion Pit song. Nonetheless, there's a strange imbalance to it. The massed chorus of chipper vocals and the stoic, pavement-pounding verse feel mismatched. And while Angelakos' literal account of the financial troubles facing his family is gut-wrenching and brave, it amounts to a curious fit on an album that's otherwise entirely personal. As a one-off, it would be an intriguing character study. As the leadoff track on <i>Gossamer</i>, it feels misplaced.</p>
<p>Luckily, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13748-ill-be-alright/"" target=""_blank"">""I'll Be Alright""</a> doesn't allow much time for the disappointment to register. The joy-buzzer synths and Angelakos' falsetto scan as instant-gratification Passion Pit, but on both a musical and lyrical level, it's a raising of the bar, far more complex than anything the band has done to date. Consider the combination of its surging chorus and the synapse-frying barrage of microscopic jumpcuts, and you might have the weirdest and catchiest band on <a href=""http://warp.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warp</a>, and the most dejected if you're really paying attention. The first line of ""I'll Be Alright"" could be a retroactive assessment on the day-glo <i>Manners</i>, asking ""Can you remember ever having any fun?/ Cause when it's all said and done/ I always believed we were/ But now I'm not so sure."" The effect is initially disorienting and uncomfortable: Do you escape into the comforts of the music or give into the lurid thrill of confrontation?</p>
<p>Angelakos is no pop subversive. While he's been <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/passion-pit/"" target=""_blank"">forthcoming about the autobiographical details</a> that inspired <i>Gossamer</i>, within the auspices of Passion Pit, he seems incapable of dealing with them through anything other than pop's pleasure principle. This was true of the now comparatively restrained <i>Manners</i>, an album of strong melodies that worked in a fairly narrow stylistic range. On <i>Gossamer</i>, Passion Pit recast themselves as polyglots and pacesetters, tackling the currency of pop music head-on as a competitor rather than admiring it with a few well-placed press quotes. <i>Gossamer</i> is rife with dichotomy, one of which is that the hooks highest in fructose are lent to songs dealing with the most uncomfortable topic: money. While ""Carried Away"" proves Angelakos might not be Ezra Koenig in terms of cleverly deconstructing the interactions between the socially stratified, there's a thematic congruence in the occasionally forced rhyme within a song about saying all the wrong things. Later on, ""Love Is Greed"" is far more multi-layered than its title and hook (""If we really love ourselves/ How do you love somebody else?"") initially indicate. Courtship is reduced to the search of ""another person that's just yours for the taking,"" which is essentially a trenchant distillation of post-recession social science.</p>
<p><i>Gossamer</i> does have humor in its perspective, but surprisingly little joy. As the penultimate track, you might expect the rafter-reaching chorus of ""It's Not My Fault, I'm Happy"" to deliver some kind of relief amidst the litany of disappointments and misunderstandings, but this is a record about things not working out as expected. It leads into the disquieting calm of closer ""Where We Belong"", where the title is explained by a blatant suicide pact (""And then I'm lifted up/ Out of the crimson tub/ The bath begins to drain/ And from the floor he prays away all my pain""). Meanwhile, ""Mirrored Sea"" siphons <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2625-m83/"" target=""_blank"">M83</a>'s rocket fuel and throws everything in reverse, a paralyzing descent into realizing the impossibility of escaping the lingering failures of youth (""Slipups in this town are like a sentence to life/ Like overhead insults or a cheating wife""). The overload of digital shoegaze abates for the message of a dispassionate vocoder: ""everyone's alone.""</p>
<p>If only it were that easy. Were <i>Gossamer</i> simply played out in Angelakos' head, it would probably turn out insufferably self-obsessed and tuneless like so many other ""difficult"" second albums. Though it doesn't make <i>Gossamer</i> a happy record, Angelakos writes with a truly affecting ability to make unflinching acknowledgments of his demons' effects on those closest to him. A substantial portion of <i>Gossamer</i> is simultaneous love letters and apologies addressed to his real-life girlfriend, and naturally they're couched within Passion Pit's most complicated arrangements to date. ""You never once controlled me/ When all the others told me/ That if I kept on going I'd be dead,"" he sings before the platinum-plated wallop of a chorus on ""Cry Like a Ghost"", an admission that takes on a menacing tone as the bridge finds him awake from a blackout (""She says I screamed and that I raised my hand/ I never meant to, I wasn't even there"").</p>
<p>Beyond that brief bit of violence, the love songs are desperate and very, very drunk. Were a more composed R&amp;B singer given the liquid slow-jam <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13825-constant-conversations/"" target=""_blank"">""Constant Conversations""</a>, the sophistication of Angelakos' melodic transitions might overshadow a devastating verse detailing a remorseful alcoholic's account of a tired partner emptying drinks and issuing ultimatums: ""If there's a bump in the road, you fix it/ But for me, well I'd just run off the road/ But tonight you've got me cornered/ And I haven't got a place to go."" It makes the context of ""On My Way"" almost unbearably intimate, Angelakos proposing, ""we'll consecrate this messy love,"" in a voice overpowering the delicate music-box arrangement of bells and whirs with promises of a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>And is that ever a mission statement for a record of passionate reactions to a messy life. Angelakos puts so much of himself into <i>Gossamer</i> that it couldn't help but be riddled with all-too-human imperfections: Sometimes you wish he'd pick a cleverer lyric, tone down the falsetto, or at least realize that it might be in his interests to try to be cool for once. Because even though <i>Gossamer</i> could not be more overt in its exploration of profoundly adult and bleak topics, all some people might choose to hear is how most of the melodies could still sell children's cereal.</p>
<p>We expect this sort of masculine reckoning from the likes of Matt Berninger, Britt Daniel, Bill Callahan, Hamilton Leithauser; gaunt, brooding men whose vocal austerity and general presence convey authority and wisdom. ""Let's not try and figure out everything at once,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">Berninger</a> sang on ""Fake Empire"", and it was a comforting statement from a guy who sounds like he's figured things out.</p>
<p>But <i>Gossamer</i>'s music is meant to reflect its sense of encroaching panic, where you really feel like you'll explode if you don't figure out everything at once. Angelakos sings variations on ""I'll be all right"" and ""everything will be OK"" throughout, but they're not so much reassurance as commiseration. It's unclear whether you're supposed to cry on his shoulder or vice versa, but it actually makes <i>Gossamer</i> more reassuring. Anyone can manufacture hope through a slogan, but there's an empathy and humanity that simply can't be faked as Angelakos tries to figure out how to stay atop his life. It's hard to think of a more noble goal for a pop album.</p></div>"|16844.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16844-gossamer/|8.4|Ian Cohen

She split with her manager, who also represents Lady Gaga. She pushed back the release date of her mixtape, <i>Fantasea</i>-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46687-azealia-banks-changes-mixtape-title/"" target=""_blank"">previously titled</a> <i>Fantastic-</i>- by a week. She performed live at what she billed as a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46734-photos-azealia-banks-mermaid-ball/"" target=""_blank"">Mermaid Ball</a>, first in New York, and then in Los Angeles, being joined for the latter by Charli XCX, Rye Rye, and unannounced guest Robyn. A New York tabloid even published gossip about her love life.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old Harlem native's use of mermaid imagery for this release is a revealing choice, and not just for its connection to the self-consciously ridiculous #seapunk subculture (which, hilariously, disavows mermaids anyway). Like Ariel with her thingamabobs, Banks is caught between worlds, a figure in transition. Her 19-track, 52-minute mixtape is an often thrilling document of a phenomenally gifted performer in a state of flux: between rapper and singer, between dance and hip-hop, between consolidating the gains built on last winter's raunchily transcendent single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12612-212/"" target=""_blank"">""212""</a> and trying out new approaches. If, as she put it, <i>Fantasea</i> is a ""test run,"" then Banks passes with aquamarine colors. Speaking of blue streaks, she's on one.</p>
<p>The past several weeks also saw Banks rapping foul-mouthed circles around Missy Elliott on a remix of M.I.A.'s ""Bad Girls"". It's the nearest she's come to the conventional hip-hop path of showing up on a better-known rapper's track, although she has appeared on music by non-rappers Major Lazer, Scissor Sisters, and, inevitably, Lana Del Rey. And whether or not Banks wants to be known as an MC, many of <i>Fantasea</i>'s best moments showcase her slang-wise verbal dexterity. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13594-jumanji/"" target=""_blank"">""Jumanji""</a>, produced by TNGHT's Hudson Mohawke and fellow UK producer Nick Hook, is the closest thing to another ""212"", with rapidfire verses and an instantly quotable ""real bitch, all day/ Uptown, Broadway"" hook over what sounds like elephants escaping from an urban zoo. Diplo's marching <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13348-fuck-up-the-fun/"" target=""_blank"">""Fuck Up the Fun""</a> lets Banks swerve between casual, non-rapped chatter and ratatat shit talk. </p>
<p>In fact, Banks' sharp ear for Caribbean-inflected, rave-reminiscent electronic backing tracks is another major factor in <i>Fantasea</i>'s considerable appeal. From the opening rework of Prodigy's jungle-crazed, Max Romeo-sampling 1992 single ""Out of Space"", the mood evokes nothing so much as Zomby's modernization of vintage electronic dance music on 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12543-where-were-u-in-92/"" target=""_blank""><i>Where Were U in '92?</i></a>. An early peak is the chipmunk-pitched house diva cries and disembodied Michael J. Fox anti-drug PSA of the title track, where Banks shifts between virtuosic fast rap and a flirtatiously sung refrain over Machinedrum's neon-blippy ""Fantastix"". Just as Banks has taken a non-traditional hip-hop path, she's avoiding lazy Calvin Harris-David Guetta club-pop trendfucking, too.</p>
<p>Of course, vintage house also has loads of connotations when it comes to sexual politics. For all the bravery of Frank Ocean's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47067-frank-ocean-opens-up-about-his-sexuality/"" target=""_blank"">unforgettable story</a> of his unrequited love for a man, it's worth remembering that Banks-- like her fellow LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts alumna Nicki Minaj-- previously went on the record as bixexual. <i>Fantasea</i> is notably fluid in its highly explicit sexual voraciousness; guys get a taste of that, erm, cake on other TNGHT half Lunice's cloud-rap snake charmer ""Runnin'"", while on O/W/W/W/L/S' cash-register-accented production ""Us"", Banks chuckles: ""I know niggas who probably dicked a nigga."" Less successful is Banks' on-the-nose vogue-rap over Zebra Katz' minimal ""Ima Read"", previously cattily perfected by Njena Reddd Foxxx. ""Fierce"", the mixtape's most overt gay-culture ode, endearingly samples a former drag queen and suggests that financial success is better than acclaim. </p>
<p>All that said, <i>Fantasea</i> is weakest when it comes to its aquatic theme. The mermaid references on ""Aquababe"" feel forced, despite riding a Machinedrum remix of Portland producer EProm's ""Regis Chillbin"" that brings to mind an air raid at a cantina for singing humpback whales. The guest rappers, too-- Yonkers hardass Styles P on acid-squiggling earworm <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13824-nathan-ft-styles-p/"" target=""_blank"">""Nathan""</a>, London grime vet Shystie over an otherworldly Ikonika track on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47125-listen-azealia-banks-and-shystie-neptune/"" target=""_blank"">""Neptune""</a>-- lend credibility, but can't quite enter Banks' self-contained world; her lack of non-producer collaborators more generally appears to be a wise choice. The brassily sung come-ons of ""Chips"" are forgettable, a rarity for Banks. And her pre-""212"" no-holds-barred rhymes on ""L8R"" lack a bit of the artist's later fire, though they do offer a provocative reminder that her talk of bisexuality isn't just for interviews.</p>
<p>That last song, ""L8R"", ends with in-studio banter about slang-term du jour ""ratchet,"" a phrase that for many people might be destined for association with Banks-- once she decides who and what she wants to be. With her debut album, tentatively titled <i>Broke With Expensive Taste</i>, still slated for this fall, that moment of truth is coming soon. Maybe ""Bambi"", a trance-inducing track overseen by Adele producer Paul Epworth that premiered early this year at a fashion show in Paris, will finally get an official release on the LP.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the best and penultimate cut on <i>Fantasea</i>, ""Esta Noche"", points in a promising new direction: conversational, cheater-luring pickup lines over a warmly inviting sample from Montell Jordan's 1999 R&amp;B hit ""Get It on Tonite"", interjected with screeching nu-rave paroxysms courtesy of Dutch producer Munchi. The comparisons to Minaj, whose own recent singles tend to break out in strobe-lit beach-rave sections, might persist. But that wouldn't be such a bad thing. ""Head of the class/ But I got principles, too,"" Banks purrs.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise from the rapper who made ""cunt"" safe for the New York Times' Style section might be if she discovers a square, sensitive side. Still, I wouldn't bet on it. ""I've been out for three years,"" she <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/fashion/azealia-banks-a-young-rapper-taking-cues-from-the-street.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told the paper</a> in February, reassuring those who fear her rise to fame has been too fast. ""I've been around."" Or whatever the fuck that means. This much has been <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18692830"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">officially confirmed</a> by scientists since Banks' previous EP: Mermaids don't exist.

In the canon, there was no room for gray areas. The Beatles, Dylan, and the Clash were important because they'd <i>always</i> been important. It was practically a science, with laws that were established on the basis of ancient albums that were similarly well-ordered, with their linear tracklists and agreed-upon contexts. You could argue that <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band </i>wasn't actually that great, but this would instantly put you in the flat-earth lunatic fringe. Certain albums were just <i>factually </i>great, which meant your experience with them, even as a newcomer, tended to be fairly rigid and pre-ordained. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The internet, as it tends to do, pretty much put an end to this old way of looking at things. The ability to access any song from any era, instantly, and place it alongside other songs from other eras-- therefore rendering the ""official"" rock narrative irrelevant-- did a big gravity check on the canon, sending its fussy compendium of carefully curated history spilling in all sorts of erratic directions. <i>Take the Kids Off Broadway</i>, the new EP by recent Jagjaguwar signees <a href=""http://foxygen.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Foxygen</a>, is latest product of this DIY context for rock history, and the spillage is as disorienting as ever. </p>
<p class=""p1""><i>Broadway </i>is fun and boisterous and consciously difficult to discern, like the sugary fuzz stuck between oldies stations. Band members Jonathan Rado and Sam France have been honing this sound for seven years, starting off as L.A. high school kids obsessed with the Brian Jonestown Massacre. (They're also big admirers of singer-songwriter-producer Richard Swift, who gets a shout-out in <i>Broadway</i>'s closer, ""Middle School Dance"".) The guys in Foxygen made 10 records together before unofficially splitting off to attend college, but they remained on the same musical page as they entered their 20s. Finally, they returned to the Foxygen fold to make a series of independently released EPs, including <i>Broadway</i>, which originally came out last year.  </p>
<p class=""p1"">France and Rado beg, borrow, and steal from 20th-century legends in uniquely 21st-century ways, deconstructing their favorite Stones, Bowie, and Lou Reed records and brazenly re-assembling those elements into free-wheeling songs that melt old sounds into weird, wild shapes. Why reference <i>Their Satanic Majesties Request </i>when you can touch on every 1960s Stones album, plus every other classic record you've just downloaded, in the space of a single song? On <i>Broadway</i>, Foxygen's music sounds like a stack of eight-tracks that's been left out in the sun too long. </p>
<p class=""p1"">While <i>Broadway </i>touches on territory similar to that previously mined by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Ariel+Pink"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5490-mgmt/"" target=""_blank"">MGMT</a>, Foxygen approach psych-pop revivalism with the cram-it-all enthusiasm of teenagers discovering rock-music staples for the first time. Coupled with a muscular virtuosity that belies Foxygen's bedroom pop roots, <i>Broadway </i>transforms familiar ingredients into unpredictable, even unwieldy music. Sometimes France and Rado lift melodies wholesale, like the interpolation of ""Ruby Tuesday"" into ""Abandon My Toys"", or the snippet of Los Bravos' 60s pop chestnut ""Black Is Black"" into the title track. Other times they make up their own timeless melodies in order to twist and subvert them, like on ""Make It Known"", the closest thing to a straightforward song on <i>Broadway</i>, which starts off as a lounge-singer synth-rock ballad that's buffeted by a free-form horn section and English music hall-style theatricality. The 10-minute ""Teenage Alien Blues"" is the purest distillation of the Foxygen aesthetic, marrying the drone-y dread of the Doors with the lysergic freakouts of the Flaming Lips before heading recklessly though detours into psychedelic Motown soul and <i>Bitches Brew-</i>inspired voodoo spaciness. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Foxygen haven't so much produced memorable songs as much as cool, disembodied sonic layers that might one day coalesce into memorable songs in your head if you listen to it enough. Whether this approach is more refined on the upcoming full-length due early next year remains to be seen. But <i>Broadway </i>suggests that Foxygen have found a patch of untamed wilderness in the midst of otherwise well-trod territory. Offering neither clarity nor order, but very much the opposite, Foxygen see exciting possibilities in these disjointed times. </p></div>"|16869.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16869-take-the-kids-off-broadway/|7.9|Steven Hyden

In the early 1990s he had flowing blond locks, was mercifully shorn of all facial hair, and could even be described as ""cherubic"" at a push. But there was still a pitiless look in his eyes in press shots. This wasn't Haines preparing for a life in the music industry; it was Haines preparing for a life-long bout of antagonizing everyone and everything around him. After a few false starts, he formed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/169-auteurs/"">the Auteurs</a> and got lifted up in the afterglow of the then-ascendant <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3970-suede/"">Suede</a>, whom his band supported on tour, helping blast open the doors for a distinctly English strain of songwriting after years of grunge-soaked fervor.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Naturally, Haines has little time for Suede, or the ensuing Britpop scene, or indeed anything else that has had the misfortune to come into contact with him over the years. Thankfully, he's become an expert and, at times, very funny documenter of his own life. His first of two books, <i>Bad Vibes: Britpop and My Part in Its Downfall</i>, was a deliciously brutal ode to hatred, cynicism, and bitterness, all powered by Haines' unshakable belief in his own talent. In 2005 a compilation titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4020-luke-haines-is-dead/""><i>Luke Haines Is Dead</i></a> was released, gathering a mixture of singles, outtakes, and rarities from his career. <i>Outsider/In</i> is a more focused collection, packaged in a cover so hideous that it looks like Haines' jaw is slowly drooping into his chest.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It's hard not to see that photograph as a deliberate aesthetic choice, although it's possible that Haines had little to do with the packaging of this compilation. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/710-nick-cave/"">Nick Cave</a> went through a deliberate process of musical and personal uglification when he formed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5203-grinderman/"">Grinderman</a>, causing him to revel in a level of repugnancy that felt like a huge creative shot in the arm for him. Haines, 10 years Cave's junior, had already been down there a long time at that point. In the mid 90s he thought it would be a good idea to release a couple of singles (both included here) from the Auteurs' third album, the Steve Albini-produced <i>After Murder Park</i>. He chose ""Light Aircraft on Fire"", about people burning to death at 10,000 feet; and ""Unsolved Child Murder"", the title of which must have really thrilled the radio pluggers at the Auteurs' major record label. It's tempting to say ""we need more like him,"" but we don't. Haines' work resonates precisely because of his lack of peers, gaining strength from having no one willing or able to descend to his depths</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The first disc from this this 2xCD set leans heavily on the Auteurs' 1993 debut <i>New Wave</i>, in which he was pedaling less sinister wares. Here, Haines is as fame-obsessed as a number of his reluctant Britpop counterparts, albeit with odd diversions into the hatred that would come to shape him on tracks like ""Valet Parking"" and ""Home Again"". Try counting the amount of times the word ""star"" appears in the lyrics on <i>New Wave</i>, and you'll quickly lose count. It would be easy to paint Haines as someone who collapsed into bitterness as his audience diminished and he tired of the industry mechanisms he bemoans in <i>Bad Vibes</i>. But Haines is a more complex character than that. His chops as a songwriter sharpened in direct inverse to his work as a musician, with throwaway songs chained to impressively catchy melodies (""Show Girl"", ""Lenny Valentino"") giving way to intelligent lyrics tied to less inspired backings (""The Spook Manifesto"", ""England vs America"").</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">What binds this wayward collection, with its diversions into the unlikely <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/%C2%B5-Ziq"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">u-ziq</a> remix project and tracks pulled from Haines' concept album about the notorious urban guerilla group Baader Meinhof, is his authoritative vocal work. Often it sounds like he's deliberately straining, adding an extra dose of misanthropy to proceedings. At other times he's up in his higher registry, then moving close to a whisper, buttering us up with a deceptive sweetness until you remember he's singing about killing a modern artist (""Death of Sarah Lucas""). When tracks are stripped out like this it can feel like Haines' is striving to make a Big Statement every time he steps in front of a microphone, and while there is a kernel of truth in that, it's largely a flaw in listening to his music this way, especially when his last brush with populism (in the group Black Box Recorder) is nowhere to be found on <i>Outsider/In</i>. Instead, we get something that's flawed, ugly, and doesn't work quite right-- all essential components in Haines' askew take on the world. </p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">""I wanna dedicate this song to the three cities that I had the pleasure of recording this tune in. Give a listen and you'll hear 'em."" That's Dale Hawkins introducing ""L.A. Memphis Tyler Texas,"" the heraldic lead-off track on <a href=""http://lightintheattic.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Light in the Attic</a>'s new compilation, <i>Country Funk 19691-1975</i>. Those cities are an awfully long way from each other, but Hawkins' song makes up the miles with its feisty Bluff City horns, gritty Texas guitars, and glitzy Hollywood groove. Geography is crucial to understanding the hazy genre called country funk, which was neither an organized scene nor a simple mix of country and funk. There was no central label or venue around which its practitioners congregated, and the compilation suggests that there were no rules either. Instead, these tracks are points on a map, representing nearly every corner of America and seemingly endless musical possibilities.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">""L.A. Memphis Tyler Texas"" makes a perfect introduction to <i>Country Funk</i> because it announces a new way of thinking about country music: In the late 1960s and especially in the early 1970s, country was breaking out of its native spaces and spreading nationwide. Its roots were in Tennessee and Texas, but it had business to take care of in New York, Detroit, and points west. Immediately following Hawkins' fanfare is John Randolph Marr's ""Hello L.A., Bye-Bye Birmingham"", a picaresque about a songwriter seeking out fame and fortune. Proving a poignant third act is Johnny Adams' ""Georgia Morning Dew"", about living in L.A. but missing home. These three songs map out territory well beyond the bayou and the holler, leaving behind the downhome and celebrating the worldly.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">This is no accident of sequencing: As country expanded from a niche market and into the mainstream, it was also expanding economically, socially, racially. You had stars like Johnny Paycheck, whose earnest voice and solid songwriting transcended novelty; you had Robert Altman's <i>Nashville</i>, a local epic pitched somewhere between condescending and admiring; you had country stars hosting televised variety shows and starring in series about truck drivers and movies about cowboys (long after the heyday of Gene Autry and Tex Ritter). Not only was country music selling to more listeners than ever, but around the time of the bicentennial, it was becoming identified as something truly and broadly American rather than just a curious regional style.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">Country Funk</span></i><span style=""font-family: Georgia;""> re-creates this shift smartly, compiling songs by white artists playing with black sounds and black artists playing with white sounds, all without drawing neat parallels between these musical traditions. There are fading stars trying to keep up with the kids (yes, that <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEllHMWkXEU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bob Darin</a>), cross-genre oddballs (Jim Ford), also- and never-rans (Dennis the Fox), session musicians boot-scooting into the spotlight (Cherokee), and even a few country superstars (Tony Joe White). It's a lot for one 70-minute album to contain, especially considering country funk may have only really existed as a cohesive category in hindsight. Fortunately, the impetus of <i>Country Funk</i> isn't historical accuracy or even critical rehabilitation. Instead, it intends primarily to be a badass playlist, an alt-universe <i>Nuggets</i> that flirts with kitsch but crams its tracklist with unexpected ideas and flourishes, unlikely filigrees of grit and invention. Even something as potentially campy as Dennis the Fox's ""Piledriver"" transcends silliness and just rocks imaginatively, with its driving drumbeat, insinuating groove, and those lost, confused, sexy backing vocals.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">Along with this worldlier version of country music came a new attitude toward the stock characters of the genre. ""Piledriver"" is a trucker anthem, but the kick is, its subject isn't your typical burly cowboy but a ""piledrivin', mean mothertrucker of a girl."" More pointedly, Mac Davis, a session musician turned solo artist, sings ""Lucas Was a Redneck"" with no little disgust, taking a stereotype that other artists have lionized-- he's dressed like Johnny Cash's ""Country Boy,"" bears some resemblance to Merle Haggard's ""Okee from Muskogee""-- and condemning him as a drunkard and a bigot who will leave only hate and shame when he dies.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">Country funk turned out to be a surprisingly broad scene, such as it was, and <i>Country Funk</i> isn't just full of white guys. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3422-chickasaw-county-child-the-artistry-of-bobbie-gentry/"">Bobbie Gentry</a>'s ""He Made a Woman Out of Me"" rewrites ""Son of a Preacher Man"" and somehow manages to intensify both the sweaty sexuality and the bittersweet reminiscence. Gentry was one of the first female artists to write and produce her own material, and her signature mix of swampy R&amp;B rhythms and lush soul vocals shows just how elastic the term ""country"" could become. I'd also say that she is perhaps the most underrated singer of the era, country or otherwise, and by way of argument would point you to ""Niki Hoeky"" or ""Fancy"" or really anything off <i>Ode to Billie Joe</i>.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i><span style=""font-family: Georgia;"">Country Funk</span></i><span style=""font-family: Georgia;""> ends with Georgia R&amp;B guitarist Johnny Jenkins' mighty cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30333-dr-john/"" target=""_blank"">Dr. John</a>'s ""I Walk on Gilded Splinters"" (which <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/319-beck/"" target=""_blank"">Beck</a> famously sampled on ""Loser""). Jenkins is backed by the Allman Brothers, and the multiracial unit creates an ungodly and unrelenting jam that reminds you of something very important: While this music occupies an intriguing place in pop history, it is first and foremost exciting to listen to. There's a kick in hearing the slinky drums on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16118-bobby-charles/"">Bobby Charles</a>' otherwise laidback ""Street People"" or endtimes vocals on Link Wray's ""Fire and Brimstone"". More than any genre or style, that sense of effusive engagement with such a wide range of materials and perspectives binds these artists together, no matter how disparate their background or their music. ""It just goes to show ya,"" Hawkins himself exclaims, ""You can take the soul pickers out of the country, but you can't take the soul out of the pickers.""</span></p>

By now, the passion play of raised and swiftly dashed hopes that occurs whenever he announces a new album has repeated itself enough times to officially qualify as farce. You'd think he'd be exhausted by now, and there were times over his last three sleepwalking efforts when he sounded just that: a guy wearily familiar with his own towering mythology, and increasingly disinterested in living up to it.</p>
<p>But what if Nas stopped fretting about blowing people's minds or disappointing them and just, you know, <i>made a record</i>? It's the kind of question Nas devotees have spent years pondering, and <i>Life Is Good</i>, his 10th studio album and strongest in three or four presidential administrations, is basically the answer. Song for song, it's his most solid, disaster-free album since, well... we won't go there, as comparing Nas albums is like comparing birthdays where your father showed up late instead of not at all. But for once, Nas sidesteps oblivion. <i>Life Is Good</i> finds him avoiding most of his worst impulses, scraping the pseudo-mystical Righteous Teacher patina off his crown and touching back down in the Queensbridge of his sense memory over late-summer-light production.</p>
<p><i>Life Is Good</i> is so consistent, in fact, that it's disorienting, and those of us with a long history navigating Nas albums will have a lot of pressing questions: What are all these top-shelf beats doing here? Where are the queasy sex jams, the songs rapped from the perspective of heroin spoons or discarded E&amp;J bottles, the choruses about being a Warrior and a Hero? Where is the blindingly ill-fitting Nas Radio Bid? (The lone example, the Swizz Beatz-produced ""Summer on Smash"", is just inoffensively generic.) But above all: What happened <i>this</i> time?</p>
<p>Part of the answer is clear. The last few years have been turbulent ones in Nas' personal life -- his brutally public split with Kelis, the costly settlement, the embarrassing fiasco with his teenage daughter tweeting pictures of a bejeweled box of condoms in her bedroom. Historically at his best when shaken, Nas has rich material to work with here, and he's more open-hearted on <i>Life Is Good</i> than he has been since <i>God's Son</i>. ""Daughters"", his sweetly reflective response to the condom-gate that is no less sweet for its slight lyrical awkwardness (he refers to what is presumably Twitter just as <a href=""http://tumblinerb.com/post/21904723180"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""the social network""</a>), finds him examining the responsibilities of fatherhood with fond bewilderment. The song aimed directly at Kelis (""Bye Baby""), meanwhile, is more a good-times remembrance than score-settling. ""You screamin' at the racist cops in Miami was probably the highlight of my life,"" he recalls, the affection audible in his voice.</p>
<p>It's also entirely possible that Nas fans have No I.D. to thank for <i>Life Is Good</i>'s quality. In <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2012/05/nas-cover-story"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the recent <i>Complex</i> cover story</a> on Nas, I.D. said that he ""wanted to make a soundtrack that allowed Nas to be Nas."" Mentor to Kanye, a Chicago rap veteran, and the current executive vice president at Def Jam, No I.D. seems to be cementing his role as the Rap Whisperer: He recently guided a deeply confused Common to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16156-common-the-dreamerthe-believer/"" target=""_blank"">his first good record in nine years</a>, and it's likely he exercised some of the same gentle-but-firm guidance here. He produces five of 14 tracks on <i>Life is Good</i>, and they all exude the warm TV-fireplace crackle of the best throwback production. You can feel the July city-heat sweat drip off the wooly saxophone on ""Stay"", while ""Back When"" flickers like a dim neon sign. The lyrics to ""Back When"" don't even do much besides gesture at Nas' musty mythology: ""check out the oracle bred by city housing,"" Hollis Ave, Shan, and Marley, ""you love to hear the story of how it all got started,"" etc. But he breathes through it with old-Shakespearean-actor fondness-- he was, after all, there, and No I.D. provides just the right lighting.</p>
<p>The rest of the production list reads as if it were crowd-sourced by exacting Nas purists: Buckwild, Salaam Remi, the late Heavy D (who gave Nas ""The Don"" before he passed away). Remi's blaring beat for ""A Queens Story"" is like a louder, more dramatic version of ""Get Down"", its tension ratcheted up by James Bond-theme horn blurts. There are a couple of playful, possibly shameless nods to <i>Illmatic</i>: On the intro to ""Loco-Motive"", a suspiciously familiar-sounding subway train rolls over tracks in the distance. Nas dedicates the song to ""my trapped in the 90s niggas,"" a line that could be used against him but that sounds, in the album's context, like playfulness. You can't recapture lightning in a bottle, or age backwards, but you can settle gracefully into strengths. Nas isn't <i>back</i>; he's just <i>here</i>.</p></div>"|16832.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16832-life-is-good/|8.3|Jayson Greene

Launched in October 2007 by three <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5687-john-maus/"" target=""_blank"">John Maus</a> obsessives, the website is a message board and unofficial news source dedicated to the lo-fi pop eccentric, philosopher, and former Haunted Graffiti member. Prior to Maus' breakthrough record, last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15596-we-must-become-the-pitiless-censors-of-ourselves/"" target=""_blank""><i>We Must Become the Pitiless Censors of Ourselves</i></a>, fans would often happen upon the site while scouring the web for his demos, only to discover they actually were not alone in their respective Maus worship. Forum avatars boast such phrases as ""MAUS IS REAL"" and ""MAUS FOR PRESIDENT"". And the discourse surrounding his reverb-washed new wave recordings and lovably pretentious persona can be profoundly sincere. Mausspacers seem unanimously to deem Maus a visionary, and often on the board he has been called a spiritual hero. Casual onlookers might wonder if Maus is legitimately insane; Mausspacers say he is prophetically different.</p>
<p>All of which is to illustrate that Maus, currently a full-time Ph.D candidate residing in Minnesota, possesses a strange kind of magnetism, due in no small part to his relentless desire to push his music to physically and intellectually intense boundaries. This new, 16-track collection of rarities and unreleased cuts from 1999 to 2010 is filled with songs of murky romance marked by his deep, gothic, and expressive vocals. It's largely been made available in physical form for committed Maus fans-- an ironic reality considering Mausspacers have already heard the majority of the material, despite the fact that it's never been commercially released. All but two tracks have been available to download on the site.</p>
<p>Regardless, this remastered <i>Collection of Rarities</i> is intriguing beyond its archival purposes, as it traces the evolution of an artist over the course of 11 years. And the readily apparent aesthetic progression here-- from elaborate noise and abstraction to Maus' progressive embrace of songcraft at its most pure and potent-- also documents Maus' developing theories regarding ""pop's true potential"" to do something visceral and subversive with the genre. Though adventurous, Maus rejects experimentation for experimentation's sake, insisting instead that ""it is our task as artists to make an intensive use of a <i>major</i> language."" Last year, <i>The W</i><i>ire </i>contributor Adam Harper published a book on Maus, titled <i>Heaven Is Real: John Maus and the Truth of Pop</i>, which considered his works as ""metapop"" that offered commentary on pop itself. ""Does Maus have something to teach us about arriving at the truth through personal musical expression?"" Harper asks. ""Has he really discovered Heaven-- and can he take us there?"" That such a book even exists says a lot about Maus and the impression his music has made. It can be thoroughly confounding. </p>
<p><i>Collection of Rarities</i>' earliest cuts are dissonant, exploratory, and slightly nonsensical. ""Lost"" feels like traveling through time-- anxious and cinematic with an indecipherable, superdramatic vocal line, and sharp, meandering keys that conjure the frantic feel of a horror film. The earliest track, 1999's ""Fish With Broken Dreams"", is suggestive of Maus' interest in classical music; the sounds of a miniature symphony orchestra filtered through a Xerox machine and pushed through the looking-glass. ""I Don't Eat Human Beings"" is a peculiar, new age atmospheric, where Maus sounds lost in his own head.</p>
<p>Maus may have moved on from the scattered structures of his early years, but, thematically, self-loathing is all over this collection, which comes off very much as the sound of a man tragically alone, working within the confines of his own shell, committing fully to each idea. ""The Fear"" is one of several meditations on inner-strife and anxiety, wherein Maus declares, ""Motherfuck, the fear is back/ The fear is back, the fear is back."" Meanwhile, ""Angel of the Night"" touches on his own personal dissatisfaction with his last LP and an ensuing breakdown. The sad earlier track ""Big Dumb Man"" strikes as even more personal, as Maus seems to unpack the quandary of an emotionally stunted intellectual, singing with an almost theatrically desperate inflection, ""Big dumb man/ Is talking about logic,"" and ""Big dumb man/ Cannot convey any emotion.""</p>
<p>Several highlights feature production that simply <i>sparkles</i>, like 2007's radiant ""All Aboard"", the driving dance groove of 2010's ""Castles in the Grave"", or ""North Star"", which conjures a lonesome, late-night feeling of subtle disorientation. But the collection's two greatest achievements do what Maus has spent his career becoming great at: unadulterated new wave pop. ""No Title (Molly)"", which was also recently released on flexi-disc for Record Store Day, is a widescreen synth-pop sprawler, where Maus repeatedly sings romantic lines like, ""I want you in my arms tonight."" Much ink has been spilt on Maus' maniacal live performances, wherein he punches the sky, tears his hair, sweats, screams, pogos, and runs-in-place; the mechanized drum beat on ""No Title (Molly)"" is tailor made for Maus' on-stage energy expulsions.  </p>
<p>And the same goes for ""Bennington"", the record's most melodic track, and one of the most earnest, comically distraught, and characteristically <i>Maus</i> anthems yet. The smart humor is rooted in just how emphatically committed Maus sounds to his own desperation on ""Bennington"". There is legitimate pain in his voice, as he plainly recounts a sole night spent with the college girl he'll dream of forever, but it's so exaggerated you can't help laughing a little, imagining Maus singing with his arms thrust to the reaches of the sky on each dramatic, downbeat synth rip. ""I still love the girl from Bennington/ Even though I'll never see her eyes,"" Maus declares, repeatedly, following cosmic, wizardly oscillations, ""I love those fucking eyes/ Those eyes don't leave my mind."" When he finally reaches the song's frustrated end, his introspective, staccato-sung plea is cringe-inducing. The narrative is tragic and ridiculous, a profoundly lonely outsider anthem.</p>
<p>""Bennington"" is one of Maus' most simple songs, but that doesn't make it any less cutting or human. The fact that Maus is open to interpretation makes him fascinating. An academic might discover the Harper book and enjoy puzzling through Maus' philosophical treatises. Enthusiasts of DIY production might gravitate toward the collection for its homemade warmth. An aesthete may marvel at his sublime synth washes, and how they pour over the emotive, baritone vocal lines. Some Mausspacers, meanwhile, are self-described ""teeny bopper-esque"" fanatics, approaching Maus like a capital-P Pop star, making Maus memes and monitoring his Twitter page and even transposing his face into pictures from the movie ""Space Jam"". And that's all fine. We ""get"" Maus as we choose.</p></div>"|16833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16833-a-collection-of-rarities-and-previously-unreleased-material/|8.4|Jenn Pelly

Together, with bassist and lap steel player Scott Hirsch, they make stark, startling music that resembles folk in outline-- muted, pastoral, mostly voice and guitar. But it's not the kind of folk that gathers children around a crackling campfire; frozen, pitilessly bleak, and foreboding, it's the kind that catalogs Biblical miseries, more ""ashes, ashes, we all fall down"" than ""this land is your land.""</p>
<p>It would be easy to assume Ollsin brought this darkness from his time in the metal trenches, but spending time with their alluring second record, <i>Grace &amp; Lies</i>, it seems equally likely that it comes from Krans. Her voice is transfixing: husky, deep, unnervingly still. Her lyrics are inscrutable but unsettling reports from a series of seriously bad mental states. ""This house is dark/ Nothing moves inside"" (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13604-night-song/"" target=""_blank"">""Night Song""</a>) is a typical lyric, and the numb, hollow, affectless way she sings it a typical delivery. Her imagery is vivid but unspecific, allowing meanings to accumulate in the unexplained spaces like snow drifts. ""Give the young one up/ Set the old one free,"" she murmurs on ""Again"".</p>
<p>Ollsin's guitar playing is stark and restrained, serving mostly to dribble ice-cold droplets on the base of your neck. You can hear his metal background in his somber gray tone, and many of his lines resemble the contemplative interludes spliced between heavier numbers on metal albums. The tribal thump and palm-muted downstroke of ""Lace"" seems moments away from splitting into roaring distortion; of course, it never does, but the implied menace adds iron boots to what is otherwise a soft, subdued album.</p>
<p>Listening to <i>Grace &amp; Lies</i> can be taxing; it feels at moments like succumbing slowly to emotional frostbite. But Krans and Ollsin stir in a few furtive warm pockets to keep their record from freezing over. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13705-moonbeams/"" target=""_blank"">""Moonbeams""</a> is a mesmerizing, drowsy ballad in which a single reverb-laden guitar rings softly underneath a thin synth, while Krans breathes the refrain, ""I gotta hear your wondering sound."" Like everything she says, it stirs unnameable sensations: What is a wondering sound? The song isn't answering. In fact, Krans ends it on a hanging note so tantalizing it feels almost like a joke: ""Do you know what I want?/ I will tell you just what I want,"" she mutters. Your ears prick; you lean in. But that's it; the song ends right there, trailing off with a sigh into silence. End transmission.</p></div>"|16853.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16853-grace-and-lies/|7.5|Jayson Greene

That release was fixed as a dystopian electronic fantasia, which Pitchfork's Jess Harvell correctly placed somewhere between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/640-cabaret-voltaire/"">Cabaret Voltaire</a>, Detroit techno, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5612-vangelis/"">Vangelis</a>' bled-dry soundtrack to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/""><i>Blade Runner</i></a>. Here on <i>Exo</i>, the duo's debut album for <a href=""http://hipposintanks.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hippos in Tanks</a>, the fundamental Gatekeeper template has been stretched and tweaked, putting one tentative foot forward into the future while the other remains firmly rooted in the past. It's muscular and brutish, often gaining mettle from a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2526-lords-of-acid/"">Lords of Acid</a>-style mesh of post-industrial density and Shoom-era acid house sounds. But there are other elements at work, including an adherence to playfulness, humor, and a rich seam of pomposity, all of which prevent it from becoming a straight-down-the-line exercise in po-faced replication.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There's an unashamed ambition that takes hold of <i>Exo</i> from its first few seconds and doesn’t let up until the last strains of the wonderfully over-the-top closer ""Encarta"" fade to black. Occasionally there's a sonic similarity to big beat in its prime, particularly when the twists of acidic synth bleed firmly into the red. But there's also a shared sense that all this work was deliberately mapped out in a gigantic space, where every last synth line and beat is designed to sound as ""big"" as possible-- a notion Gatekeeper share with acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"">the Chemical Brothers</a> in their prime. There isn't much room for subtlety and nor should there be-- ""Exolift"" and ""Hydrus"" find their weight from being gloriously dumb, driven by sledgehammer riffs that only increase in intensity as each track progresses. Even tracks that take more subtle turns (""Bog"", ""Pre-Gen"") are propped up by an overwhelming feeling of grandiosity, lending a magisterial quality to the entire enterprise.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46013-gatekeeper-announce-new-album-game/"">media campaign</a> for <i>Exo</i> matches the sense of aspiration that percolates throughout the LP, with special fonts released to decipher hidden messages, plus an as-yet unseen first-person gaming environment designed by <a href=""http://www.taborrobak.com/site/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tabor Robak</a> to help explore ""various worlds inspired by the tracks on the album."" Such ideas mirror the prog leanings the album sometimes buffers up against, although <i>Exo</i> is mercifully untethered from that world by its brief, 35-minute runtime. Gatekeeper never fully reach down into that environment in the same way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2223-justice/"">Justice</a> did on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15966-audio-video-disco/""><i>Audio, Video, Disco</i></a>, instead choosing to take their rock cues from even more unlikely sources. ""Encarta"" is the kind of ludicrously grand musical gesture that would have Meat Loaf producer Jim Steinman beaming with pride, with its bombastic vocal chants leading the march toward a bedlam-fueled conclusion that bears more of a resemblance to a battering ram than it does to anything musical.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Ending <i>Exo</i> in such a supercilious way is a marvelous act of insolence, hopefully hinting at freshly brazen territories Gatekeeper can move into on further releases. It would certainly be better than the tendency this duo has for dipping a little too hard into the acid vaults. On ""Encarta"" they can overcome that by the sheer vigor of the other musical ideas, and occasionally that tendency does hit odd moments of inspiration-- the opening ""Imax"" pines for an era that's yet to pass, attempting to accelerate the nostalgia cycle by retro-frying the present-- but elsewhere their leap into the future is stunted by the past bearing down too hard on their coattails.</p>

Nevertheless, I'm unusually interested in finding out what their side projects sound might sound like. After all, membership in the perpetually youthful and lusty Omaha collective seems to be akin to that of 1017 Brick Squad or a 1990s Norwegian black metal band, as much as musical act as a lifestyle requiring a level of commitment so intense and total that you can't envision anyone having outside interests. Then again, we've learned over the past two decades that Omaha is possibly the least musically monogamous city in America and so here's <a href=""http://ickyblossoms.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Icky Blossoms</a>, the brainchild of TaTW guitarist/vocalist Derek Pressnall, along with singer Sarah Bohling and guitarist Nik Fackler. If all you know about Tilly is the tapdancer, <i>Icky Blossoms</i> will throw you off: Produced by decidedly non-Cornhusker <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6770-dave-sitek/"" target=""_blank"">Dave Sitek</a>, the trio's debut alternates between caffeinated synth-pop, nocturnal bar crawls, and straight-up electroclash revival. But even if they're working in a genre that demands an icy façade, they fortunately can't hide the enthusiasm that often defines Pressnall's main gig.</p>
<p>At the outset, Bohling manages to summarize the pervasive feeling of <i>Icky Blossoms</i>-- ""Play it cool/ While fevered."" ""Heat Lightning"" and ""I Am"" are respective showcases for the vocals of Bohling and Fackler, both of whom sound ready to pounce if they could just get out of their own heads. Bohling sings ""I don't want to be afraid/ I want to take you home"" on the former, an inversion of the slow-burning and confident sexuality typified by her style of deadpan emoting. Meanwhile, amidst tic-laden, jerky dance-rock that bears a strong resemblance to several <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12246-dear-science/"" target=""_blank""><i>Dear Science</i></a> cuts, Fackler yelps ""I'm not a game/ I'm no special prize/ I'm me and I am who I say I am,"" as a strangely affecting sales pitch. They're auspicious for sure and melodically immediate, but in all fairness, it's due in part to unshakable resemblances to Bloc Party's ""Banquet"" and, um, Pearl Jam's ""Do the Evolution"".</p>
<p>And yet, those don't sound like the ""singles"" in the manner ""Sex to the Devil"" and ""Babes"" do, as those stand out largely due to their monomaniacal stylistic devotion. Which is to say that a cynic's outlook on <i>Icky Blossoms</i> might view it less of a showcase of Pressnall and Bohling's songwriting chops and more of a referendum on electroclash, of whether it was worthy in the first place and/or whether it's due for a revial. In TaTW, the songs were about sex, these ones are often about the concept of being sexy and given to the more traditionally alluring vocals of Bohling. This is altogether reasonable, and in a way that's charming to the subgenre: The more portentous the duo's lyrics are, the more meaningless they sound amidst the rigid beats and frigid synth buzz.</p>
<p>Thing is, hard as they try, Icky Blossoms never convincingly embody a truly elegant wastefulness. You think back to the electroclash elite and it was bands like Fischerspooner and Ladytron, painfully cool, annoyingly urban-- they barely sounded human, let alone like people who did mundane bullshit like second vocal takes or going to Guitar Center to buy strings. Icky Blossoms still mostly sound like a <i>band</i> rather than mannequins, which is something of a mixed blessing. For all its tears-in-your-PBR stereotypes, Saddle Creek has always maintained a relationship with synth music and charmingly approach it as outsiders. Whether it's the Faint's thrift-store new wave, the lush and introverted <i>Now It's Overhead</i>, or the paranoid narcosis of Bright Eyes' electro one-off <i>Digital Ash in a Digital Urn</i>, those records never sounded overly polished or expensive.</p>
<p>Even with Sitek aboard, that's the case with <i>Icky Blossoms</i>. The production is simultaneously slick, yet standoffish, like there was a ""Premium Package"" the band didn’t spring for. The deeper Icky Blossoms get into pastiche, the easier it is to focus on how they violate the dress code: ""Cycle"" and ""Stark Weather"" could pass for perfectly fine <i>Kill For Love</i> demos untouched by Johnny Jewel's expert retromania, looking the part by skulking under streetlights but doing little to create an atmosphere of impending danger or insatiable longing. On the opposite end, ""Burn Rubber"" and ""Temporary Freakout"" are in the right borough seeking guidance for their turn-of-the-millennium dance-punk, but they're asking for some DFA grit as opposed to TVOTR gloss.</p>
<p>So while the band comprises veterans, it's worth remembering <i>Icky Blossoms</i> is still a debut. That point is driven home by the appropriately-titled closer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13640-perfect-vision/"" target=""_blank"">""Perfect Vision""</a>, the moment where the past and present of Icky Blossoms' personnel dovetail towards an individual perspective. A woozy, six-minute duet cruising at a pace no quicker than a backhand moving across a sweaty brow, Pressnall and Bohling kick back as boredom sets in, bicycles spin all over town, and ""there's nothing to do but get high in the afternoon."" It's the most in-tune the two sound with each other on <i>Icky Blossoms </i>and the most potent unification of sound and emotion as well. It'd be too easy to posit Icky Blossoms as a mid-career diversion for Pressnall, to consider the band latecomers or hayseed interlopers to a sound NYC hasn't had much use for in a while. And perhaps it's unfair to hold them to the standards of their urban peers when ""Perfect Vision"" suggests<i> </i>Icky Blossoms might be more suited for wasteful afternoons than a wasted evening.</p></div>"|16830.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16830-icky-blossoms/|6.6|Ian Cohen

And not once did I feel like I was being taken advantage of. Billy Corgan: That guy knew how to <i>give</i>. Obviously, his willingness to personally pen his own liner notes, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jelyGb0luj8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">skewer his poor lil' rich boy image at Hullabalooza</a>, author a column in <i>Guitar World</i> to teach you how to get the <i>right </i>tone for ""Geek U.S.A."" and <a href=""http://www.starla.org/articles/geek.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lick shots at Steve Lukather</a> weren't entirely altruistic. Corgan's tremendous artistic hot streak was fueled by self-loathing and self-aggrandizement, the equal and opposite manifestations of a whopping ego. But what other multi-platinum rock star was doing this kind of thing back then?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Smashing Pumpkins' reissues have been certainly generous so far, and<i> Pisces Iscariot </i>is no exception.<span> However,</span> <i>Pisces Iscariot </i>was generous to begin with, a stopgap between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16059-gish-deluxe-edition-siamese-dream-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Siamese Dream </i></a>and <i>Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness</i> that was described by Corgan as his attempt to make a mixtape instead of an album. That's pretty much bullshit. He obviously comes from a background that worships the LP form, and <i>Pisces Iscariot </i>is painstakingly sequenced to maintain a concept record's sonic peaks and valleys, favoring stylistic cohesion over protracted diversity. Its ratio of sweet acoustic strummers, barnstorming riff-rockers, and expansive guitar freakouts is balanced almost exactly akin to that of <i>Siamese Dream </i>or <i>Gish. </i>It still works as an album if you want it to, meaning it's not exactly <i>Incesticide </i>or <i>Masterplan </i>as far as alt-rock cash-ins go. This is a compliment Corgan would probably take as a tremendous validation.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In fact, the only concrete way to differentiate this from a typical Smashing Pumpkins album without Corgan's designation are the cover songs, and what's interesting is how <i>uninteresting </i>the selections are. Corgan would align himself with the likes of Queen, Boston, and Black Sabbath as something of a preemptive strike; bands who sold a ton of records and were often reviled for having the wrong kind of ambitions. But on the deluxe version of <i>Pisces Iscariot</i>,<i> </i>you can find live covers of the Velvet Underground's ""Venus in Furs"" and Neil Young's ""Cinnamon Girl"", both of which are basically ""Livin' on a Prayer"" in Canon Karaoke.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The two that made <i>Pisces </i>proper definitely earned their place, though. Who knows what inspiration Corgan took from the beer-barrel-chested belting of Eric Burdon, but their version of the Animals' ""A Girl Named Sandoz"" is loose and fun, a rare instance where you might imagine Smashing Pumpkins as four people who legitimately enjoyed making music together. More crucial is ""Landslide"", which works largely because Corgan doesn't go out of his way to make it his<i>. </i>There are no kettle drums, no weeping strings, just a nylon acoustic, a single overdub for the solo, and one of his most sympathetic and tender vocal performances. It's not a hard song to pull off, but this version verges on definitive. And as these things generally worked out at the height of the music industry boom, it allowed Smashing Pumpkins' so-called ""mixtape"" to go gold and peak at No. 4 on the Billboard chart. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">""Landslide"" assured the band some career momentum, and it's also the key to understanding what <i>Pisces </i>says about the Smashing Pumpkins in 1994. Corgan may not have been <i>better </i>at making wispy, acoustic love songs than he was at colossal electric odysseys at the time, but it's a side that had been underdeveloped. <i>Siamese Dream </i>had its soft side, obviously, but those songs befitted a heavy, heavy record-- ""Disarm"", ""Spaceboy"", and even ""Luna"" dripped with pathos and Mellotron strings. Conversely, <i>Pisces</i>' delicate bookends, ""Soothe"" and ""Spaced"", are every bit what their titles suggest, disarming you with fumbled acoustic picking and found sound (according to the liner notes, you can hear the cars outside Corgan's apartment go by on the former).</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Meanwhile, ""Obscured"" and ""Whir"" are two of Corgan's most gorgeous songs, period. The chord progressions are almost incapacitating in their beauty, supplemented by gauzy vocals, brushed drumming, and harmonic feedback touched by an early-morning vulnerability that the Pumpkins would never achieve again, not even on <i>Adore</i>. <i></i>It was perhaps the one mode in which James Iha could reasonably compete with Corgan, and his contribution, ""Blew Away"", is indicative of the more country-ish lean of his solo albums. Had Smashing Pumpkins' albums not been such massive undertakings, it would have been interesting to hear what an LP of true-blue love songs might have accomplished.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The lighter touch has a varied effect on <i>Pisces</i>' rock tracks. Many of them are top-shelf: The 11-minute ""Starla"" is the moonier, flower-child kin of ""Silverfuck"", and ""Hello Kitty Kat"" and ""Frail &amp; Bedazzled"" are groove-heavy glam-rock. While there's no shame in saying nothing here could dislodge a track from <i>Siamese Dream</i>--<i> </i>one of the best records of its time-- the question is, <i>why </i>are these B-sides? Part of it is tautological. They don't generate the same heft as ""Quiet"" or ""Rocket"" because they lack the associative power of being on the actual records. You get an idea of what separates an album cut from a B-side with songs like ""Plume"" and ""Pissant"". Corgan has a weakness for this kind of thing-- lyrically regressive (""talk revolution as if it matters now,"" ""my boredom has outshone the sun""), musically blunt, and presented in a relatively ""raw"" fashion. But it mostly shows him to be completely unconvincing as a punk or a burnout.<span>  </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">For the Smashing Pumpkins, conviction is equivalent to effort, and although Corgan lived to boast of hand-manipulating tape flange and backmasking spoken-word samples, his overcompensation in the studio wasn't about bolstering weak songs. Rather, it was all about bolstering the idea that You, Alienated Teen Listener, shared Corgan's pervasive sense of persecution and that those guitar armies and forthright moping orders provided the necessary ammunition to battle a world that was rigged against you. Nothing on <i>Pisces Iscariot </i>is a dud, but since Corgan puts ""mixtape"" below the level of ""album,"" you sense he knew something we didn't about ""Blue"" or ""Plume"". Perhaps he determined a structural deficiency rendering them incapable of enduring the overdubbing rigor that spawned the thematically similar but exponentially mightier ""Bodies"", ""Fuck You (An Ode to No One)"", or, obviously, ""Bullet With Butterfly Wings"".<span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Because really, Smashing Pumpkins songs were larger than life and Billy Corgan was not. And he knows it. And the years <i>burn. </i>He never conveyed the political or ethical gravitas of Bono or Eddie Vedder, never was as beautiful and doomed as Kurt Cobain, never stood for musical and technological progress like Thom Yorke. And even if the derision he earned in indie rock was based on outmoded ideals of authenticity, the hatred was real.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Still, even as his first and most intense fans get to rewrite the history of the 90s, Corgan gets left out of the critical pantheon. The music of <i>Pisces Iscariot </i>won't change that, even though it's something close to essential for any self-identifying Pumpkins fan (to these ears, it's more distinctive, sonically diverse, <i>and </i>consistent than the beloved but ultimately threadbare <i>Gish</i>.) But even if most of his musical values are and were derided for celebrating 70s prog/pomp excess, <i>Pisces Iscariot</i> is proof that Corgan<i> </i>might actually be more progressive than he lets on. When you look at how Billy Corgan used the Smashing Pumpkins to interact with the public at the time-- treating liner notes as an exchange between pen pals, doing odd press of his own volition, making ""mixtapes"" that fused curation with composition-- these are all things that feel awfully commonplace now.<span> </span>Is it any wonder his general attitude nowadays is ""no good deed goes unpunished?""</p></div>"|16929.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16929-pisces-iscariot/|8.1|Ian Cohen

<p class=""MsoNormal"">A lot of comparisons to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4158-paul-simon/"" target=""_blank"">Paul Simon</a>'s <i>Graceland</i> are cropping up in reviews of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27162-the-very-best/"" target=""_blank"">the Very Best</a>'s <i>MTMTMK</i>, even though the two albums have completely different contexts, styles, and lyrical aims. An American adult-contemporary pop star conscripting South African musicians in the last days of apartheid is not comparable to a breakout Malawian singer and a Swedish producer fusing Westernized Afro-pop with European dance music in 2012. Nor are the Very Best's direct appeals for sex (""Rumbae"") and political change (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46286-the-very-best-return-with-new-album-video/"" target=""_blank"">""Yoshua Alikuti""</a>) particularly evocative of Simon's coded flights of imagery. The only thing the records really share is some African drumming. Still, the urge to mentally connect them is understandable.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>Graceland </i>provoked an anguished and multifaceted debate among white Westerners that was essentially about the ethics of globalization in music. The Very Best seemed custom-made to render it moot. The hand-wringing attained a fever pitch the mid-2000s, when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a> started spiking their electronic goo with African rhythms and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5594-vampire-weekend/"" target=""_blank"">Vampire Weekend</a>'s preppy Afro-pop proved to be an emotional reflex hammer. But then came Esau Mwamwaya, flipping Vampire Weekend's ""Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa"" and giving everyone tacit permission to just chill out a bit. His later, glorious collaboration with Ezra Koenig, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11379-warm-heart-of-africa-ft-ezra-koenig/"" target=""_blank"">""Warm Heart of Africa""</a>, made the concept of musical authenticity as a caste system seem hopelessly obsolete.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In the 1980s, musical globalism was something Paul Simon had to construct, traveling abroad and breaking a cultural boycott. Now it happens more serendipitously: A French producer who works with a Swedish partner walks into a secondhand furniture shop in East London and meets a Malawian singer. On the Very Best's outstanding first mixtape and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12503-esau-mwamwaya-and-radioclit-are-the-very-best/"" target=""_blank"">album</a>, that sense of happy effortlessness was the secret sauce in a recipe that included handsome vocal melodies, lush yet vigorous electronic production, and the sun-beam vocal timbre of Mwamwaya. Unfortunately, the effortlessness ebbed after Etienne Tron quit, leaving Mwamwaya to work as a duo with Johan Hugo (<span class=""st"">né </span>Karlberg) on the solid but indistinct <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15464-super-mom/"" target=""_blank""><i>Super Mom</i></a> mixtape. <i>MTMTMK</i> is more satisfying, but it's still a bit overworked in ways that undercut its strengths.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Hugo grabs up everything from Euro-pop and kwela to bhangra and moombahton and melts them into shiny hunks that bounce and slip around. Mwamwaya belts out catchy refrains in a mix of English and Chichewa. A variety of African guest singers and rappers work efficiently, except on ""Bantu"", where the amount of stardom in one place-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/247-amadou-mariam/"" target=""_blank"">Amadou &amp; Mariam</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28089-baaba-maal/"" target=""_blank"">Baaba Maal</a>-- inadequately compensates for a shapeless track. The music still exudes pleasure, but it's sometimes checked by ponderous production choices. Highlights such as ""Yoshua Alikuti"", ""Kondaine"", and ""I Wanna Go Away"" are infectiously giddy, but the droning ""Adani"" loses focus in a wandering arrangement. The fussier production can sometimes be a boon, as on ""Rumbae"", where the vinyl drag on the singing adds a powerful swerve to the rhythm, but the squealing cuts in the home stretch are grating.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">On unforgettable bangers such as ""Julia"" from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13518-warm-heart-of-africa/"" target=""_blank""><i>Warm Heart of Africa</i></a>, the Very Best emphasized the radiant ease of Mwamwaya's voice with lucid, throbbing production. There could be numerous explanations for the slight shift toward cramped opacity here. Perhaps a trio is better at editing than a duo. Perhaps they simply wanted to make a heavier album, and succeeded in a mildly wearying way. Or perhaps the Very Best are pointedly playing against the stereotypes of African openness and simplicity that they were originally celebrated for. Any points of friction with our expectations are probably signs that the old musical caste system isn't quite worn out yet.</p></div>"|16835.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16835-mtmtmk/|7.0|Brian Howe

The trio have been taking it easy since Annie Hart had a baby in 2010, leading to this five-song debut EP from ARS's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29841-erika-spring/"" target=""_blank"">Erika Spring</a>, which feels like the next footstep in their mood-leaning trajectory. It's not that much of a change in sound from Spring's other band, but it's the first Au Revoir Simone-related material you might recommend to a friend who doesn't share your sweet tooth.</p>
<p>Spring has an understated wisp of a voice, but these songs achieve a difficult balance that puts them a cut above the generic dream-pop crop-- they're soft and hazy but never vague, probably because Spring envisioned the EP with percussion in mind. She cites the tom-heavy sound of early-1980s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6496-phil-collins/"" target=""_blank"">Phil Collins</a> as the collection's formative influence (""I was obsessing over the Phil Collins song 'I Don't Care Anymore',"" she said in a <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2012/07/11/interview-erika-spring/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent interview</a>), and the glassy, reverb-free percussion of Jorge Elbrecht from the shoegaze-y <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28480-violens/"" target=""_blank"">Violens</a> brings that vision to life. His grooves are steady and restrained (any impulses towards some ""In the Air Tonight""-style scene-stealing are kept in check) but as a counterpoint to Spring's breathy vocals, they keep the songs from dissolving. The results are hypnotic, from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/473-broadcast/"" target=""_blank"">Broadcast</a>-like reverie of ""Hidden"" to the looping and seductive ""Happy at Your Gate"". ""Hey, the gate is unlocked,"" she insists until it sounds like a come-on, ""No, you don't have to turn away.""</p>
<p>The EP's weakest link is another nod to 80s pop: a cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23572-the-eurythmics/"" target=""_blank"">Eurythmics</a>' ""When Tomorrow Comes"". Spring does make the source material her own, transforming the bombastic pop of the original into a sleepy, feather-light tune, but it feels maudlin (the tipping point comes in the form of pre-chorus wind chimes) in comparison with the rest of the EP's glassy cool. Still, there's something refreshing about how it errs on the side of earnestness. Spring gets points for reappropriating 80s synth pop and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15034-kaputt/"" target=""_blank""><i>Kaputt</i></a>-style soft rock in a context that's utterly devoid of ironic scare quotes, which is why this collection of sophisticated songs feels like an important notch in her growth as a songwriter. There's more depth to Spring's 80s influence than there used to be (Au Revoir Simone was, after all, named for a line from <i>Pee-wee's Big Adventure</i>), Erika Spring displays a genuine interest in replicating the texture and aesthetic of the music she grew up with. The elements of pastiche are woven smoothly into her sound, which dances gracefully on the edges of past and present, of waking life and dreams.</p></div>"|16826.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16826-erika-spring-ep/|7.2|Lindsay Zoladz

As Nikolic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/rising/8876-poolside/"" target=""_blank"">told Pitchfork's Ian Cohen</a>, Poolside provided some relief after they'd spent too much time trying to churn out hits for pop stars. You can hear that step away from the rat race in <i>Pacific Standard Time. </i>It's a disco album that slinks along with the urgency of a teenager on the first day of summer vacation. The album's tempo and temperament call to mind images of a palatial California, where the water is as clear as the sun is bright and the slow drip of time is inconsequential. But the album is ultimately more aligned with the nastier stereotype of L.A., the one where everything looks superficially good from a distance but reveals papered-over flaws the closer you get.</p>
<p class=""p2""><i>Pacific Standard Time</i>, to the band's credit, sounds fantastic: the basslines are fat, the guitars ripple, the keyboards radiate, and the percussion evokes ice rattling around in cocktail glasses. It is also an entirely functional record. Poolside are very clear that they didn't set out to accomplish a damn thing with this album, and if you weren't setting out to accomplish a damn thing with your summer day, you could pick many worse soundtracks. Its 72-minute run time is almost hilariously unnecessary, unless of course, you have plans to lie by the water for a few hours.</p>
<p class=""p2""><i>Pacific Standard Time </i>sounds like exactly what it is: an album put together by two guys who have spent their careers DJing and playing in bands behind better, more accomplished songwriters. The taste on display here is impeccable, as is the playing. The best tracks could slot perfectly into hip Balearic revival mixes, but Poolside aren't necessarily redundant. Balearic disco usually moves to transport the listener to the beach. But <i>Pacific Standard Time </i>is distinctly high-gloss and narcotic, recalling the slick, bright disco of 1970s acts like the Bee Gees and Chic. The problem, though, is that Poolside don't have the songs to match.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Nikolic hasn't sung much in bands before, and the duo acknowledges this by doing things like draping his vocals in effects or mixing them into the track so they're nothing more than another element of sheen. Most of the time, they're not even really needed: songs like ""Kiss You Forever"" or ""California Sunset"" are fine instrumentals turned into facile songs thanks to elementary and disinvested writing. There are songs qua songs here that do work (""Slow Down"", ""Do You Believe"") but more often than not Nikolic's vocals are distracting and ill-fitting. The end of the record does hold a bit of a respite though: the beautifully liquid ""Between Dreams"" is thankfully an instrumental, while the sighing comedown ""Take Me Home"" features tastefully deployed singing.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Poolside are quick to mention that <i>Pacific Standard Time </i>was put together quickly, and largely while the duo was tipsy. Criticisms are easily deflected. There is ostensibly nothing wrong with writing lifestyle music, even if the lifestyle is so narrow that you actually call yourself Poolside. This album is expertly executed escapism, but bands like Studio, Air France, and Meanderthals have shown us that it's possible to be much, much more. Put on <i>Pacific Standard Time</i>, slap on the sunscreen, lie down, and zone out. Just don't ask it to resonate.</p></div>"|16865.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16865-pacific-standard-time/|6.1|Jordan Sargent

Still, this collection of tracks culled from Irish post-punk, DIY, and electronic musicians circa 1980-83 carries an uncommon weight, sounding less like a footnote and more like a series of essential transmissions from a set of socially and politically disenfranchised musicians. It marks the first release for <a href=""http://www.finderskeepersrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Finders Keepers</a>' new offshoot label Cache Cache, which promises to reissue ""shyly excitable electric pop music."" <i>Strange Passion</i> consists of tracks pulled from rare vinyl and cassette releases, all lovingly collated by Dublin DJ Darren McCreesh, who completes the package with insightful sleeve notes and mini-bios of all the artists. The mood ranges from prickly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1677-gang-of-four/"">Gang of Four</a>-style aggression to contemplative electronic works that pick up a strand left dangling by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/526-brian-eno/"">Brian Eno</a>'s ambient pieces.</p>
<p>Most compilations that try to make similar abridgments between conflicting styles feel messy and unfocused, but here the eclecticism acts as a near-perfect précis of the wide-ranging impulses that have fallen under the ""post-punk"" umbrella since it was coined. But there are also ties that bind these acts, principally in the underlying themes of future-gazing and disenchantment that burrow deep into the scruffy heart of post-punk. ""Ireland in the 70s and 80s was in the grip of uncertainty,"" writes McCreesh in the sleeve notes. ""Conflict in the north, social conservatism in the south, both fueled by religious hegemony and a truly desperate economic situation."" Out of such shaky foundations came the urgent bursts of expression <i>Strange Passion</i> documents, guided by documentation of the wider post-punk movement from the local music press and radio broadcasts by RTÉ and John Peel's BBC show.</p>
<p>The best-known act here, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28275-gavin-friday/"">Gavin Friday</a>'s <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Virgin+Prunes?ac=virgin+prunes"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Virgin Prunes</a>, do their best to assimilate the feel of cheap amphetamines in song, with a short, treble-y barrage of energy that feels like they're repeatedly sticking a fork in your leg. At times it's telling just how much of a debt some of these acts owe to things happening elsewhere. Dogmatic Element's ""Just Friends"" is a well-executed piece of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4113-the-slits/"">Slits</a> worship, while the Peridots' ""No Water"" roughly slots into the experiments with brooding electronics conducted by Sheffield acts <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/640-cabaret-voltaire/"">Cabaret Voltaire</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7221-the-human-league/"">the Human League</a>. Conversely, the music of Roger Doyle, working here under his Operating Theatre alias with actress Olwen Fouere, stretches out into more unique spaces. Their ""Austrian"" is a perfectly eccentric twist on cranky electronic pop that occasionally sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1672-diamanda-galas/"">Diamanda Galás</a> fronting <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24919-the-flying-lizards/"">the Flying Lizards</a>.</p>
<p>So the artists on <i>Strange Passion</i> may have been borrowing heavily, but many of them brought their own takes on cross-genre pollinization to the table. The wonderfully named Chant! Chant! Chant! primarily operate in an indie funk space similar to that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/245-a-certain-ratio/"">A Certain Ratio</a> or <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Chakk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chakk</a>, but wrap up the package with featherweight jangly guitars and sulky teen vocal angst. Stano's ""Town"" draws on the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29395-nile-rodgers/"">Nile Rodgers</a>-like guitar lines that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3226-orange-juice/"">Orange Juice</a> were channeling in Glasgow, except here it's matched by punk vocal sneers that lend it a neat light/dark juxtaposition. Throwing discordant elements into the mix to see what comes out is firmly in keeping with the spirit of the times, but the desire to create another fork in the road, to not just slavishly replicate what came before, is what makes this album (and post-punk as a genre) such a consistently fascinating area to re-explore.</p>
<p>McReesh admits there are further Irish bands from this era who are worthy of investigation, although <i>Strange Passion</i> is likely to be the cream of the crop. What's most interesting about it as a historical document is how this music tapped into a prevailing feeling and ended up so energized despite being cut off from the rest of the world. It's a mood that seems to have been mirrored everywhere at the time-- bands like <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Primitive+Calculators"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Primitive Calculators</a> and <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Marching+Girls?ac=marching+girls"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Marching Girls</a> finding a tiny but essential space in Australia, playing like their lives depended on it even though the world wasn't listening. Local acts not achieving global recognition isn't an unusual phenomenon per se-- even in the internet era, there are likely to be hundreds of provincial chillwave artists who achieved nothing more than local renown, albeit with better distribution channels at their disposal. But the difference is that bands like Major Thinkers and the Threat, both included here, gained strength from such insular surroundings, proving that a lonely shout in the dark can be just as vital as one that brings people together on a mass scale.</p></div>"|16892.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16892-strange-passion-explorations-in-irish-post-punk-1980-83/|6.7|Nick Neyland

Even in 2003, it wasn't your typical Southern sludge swamp. That said, I doubt anyone listening then could've predicted <i>Yellow &amp; Green</i>. The quartet's new 18-song, 75-minute double album offers a broad, rich expanse of pretty, psychedelic, occasionally heavy, mostly straight-up rock that veers easily into pop, post-rock, and lulling ambient washes. There are a number of new elements to Baroness in 2012-- frontman John Baizley is the father of a young daughter and lives in Philadelphia instead of Savannah; after the recording of <i>Yellow &amp; Green</i>, Matt Maggioni came on board as the group's new bassist (which means longtime member Summer Welch is no more). The sound itself is the biggest shift, though it shouldn't come as a total surprise. They've hinted at these new avenues, and even tentatively explored a few, on their first two LPs, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13603-blue-record/"" target=""_blank""><i>Blue Record</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10646-red-album/"" target=""_blank""><i>Red Album</i></a>. What's surprising here is how well it all works.</p>
<p>There's almost always some filler on a record of this length-- it's a casualty of double albums-- but there's an impressive scarcity of it here. Even the songs that float by more humbly, or as background music, ultimately have a place in the overall dynamic by the first or second listen. And they are all <i>songs</i>. Take the ""themes"" that open <i>Yellow</i> and <i>Green</i>, respectively, the warm, aqueous two minutes of ""Yellow Theme"", the more drifting, airy, chilly (and post-rock anthemic) four-and-a-half minutes of ""Green Theme"". These are beautiful instrumentals, compositions with actual force and not more incidentals.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/8886-longform/"" target=""_blank"">I recently interviewed Baizley</a> about the record. He detailed how the group's idea of heaviness shifted from their early days to the present. He explained that ""tricks"" like ""10 amplifiers on stage, a ton of volume, and notes on [a] guitar that were more appropriate for bass guitar"" were a kind of ""artifice to mask youthful songwriting."" In the present, the group is more focused on subtlety: ""Now that songs have become more important to us, we're trying to find the more nuanced, more appropriate-for-us idea of heavy.""<i> Yellow &amp; Green</i> showcases this new take in spades. As Baizley put it, ""the Baroness-circa-2012 definition of heavy [is] not a tuning and it's not necessarily a volume; it's more of a feeling or an idea or some goal post that we're headed towards."" And, practically speaking, the cleaner singing is a kind of survival tactic: His and backup vocalist Pete Adams' vocal cords couldn't continue along the raw, shouting path they'd set for themselves earlier on.</p>
<p>Baizley stressed that, although it's a double LP, <i>Yellow &amp; Green</i> is not a concept record. That said, one theme certainly leaps out: that of aging, and the ways it changes our ideas surrounding music from one stage of adulthood to the next. Albums that force artists to go deep into themselves as people and as musicians tend to end up as accidental concept records, collections that document the time they pushed themselves to create, and the life they were otherwise living at that time. But this one feels very closely aligned to getting closer to 40, to feeling your bones creak a little more, your eyes getting a little weaker.</p>
<p>It's in the lyrics with words that fixate on disappearances, fractures, sleep, bruises, bracing for death, failing hearts, and saying goodnight to your father. Or there's the nostalgia of a line like, ""when we were kids we never felt so young, take me to a hazy Sunday morning."" Then again, we also get plenty of blood (""this apple makes me sick, says this pig upon the stick, it's my own blood"") and water, as both baptism and drowning, or beginning and end. (A track like ""March to the Sea"" has water in its title, but there's something about its musicality that brings to mind early-1990s post-rock, too, and that post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/"" target=""_blank"">Slint</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2217-june-of-44/"" target=""_blank"">June of 44</a>-style obsession with anchors and sails.)</p>
<p>John Congleton, who also produced <i>Blue</i>, again gels perfectly with the band. Each song has levels and layers: It's an album for headphones as well as one for lighters in the middle of a smoky club. You get weird gurgles of noise, shimmering deep layers of sound, electronic swirls. ""Twinkler"" is like a downcast campfire greek chorus; ""Cocainium"" has that kind of ambiance, too, but picks up the drum beat-- it's a variation on psychedelic pop that made me think of the Turtles until the muscular bass, distorted guitars, and grungy chorus.</p>
<p>Baizley said the cover art, and the songs themselves, reflect the feeling of the moment before or after a disaster; of course, these are very different feelings, but I know what he means. It's not all waiting around and recovering. There's pure climactic catharsis, as you'd expect from Baroness, but these tracks work in a way Baroness songs haven't previously. Instead of explosions, billows, and howls, we get a more meditative air, even on some of the bigger rockers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13606-take-my-bones-away/"" target=""_blank"">""Take My Bones Away""</a> or the rollicking ""Board Up the House"". Each mountain is chased with something a littler gentler. It's thrilling hearing people this technically adept holding back a little, showing restraint, and cramming what they know into a pop nugget. It's what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8794-torche/"" target=""_blank"">Torche</a> have done well in the past, especially on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12020-meanderthal/"" target=""_blank""><i>Meanderthal</i></a>, but it's bigger, more spacious and stadium-sized here. (Like if Torche actually were the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1534-foo-fighters/"" target=""_blank"">Foo Fighters</a>.)</p>
<p>One of these climaxes is ""Eula"", the heart-crushing finale to<i> Yellow</i>, seven minutes of crisp acoustics, atmospheric (and anthemic) vocals, and warped chiming sounds that accompany descriptions of bones breaking, a house becoming a cage-- in other words, the end of something. But it's not: ""Eula"" ushers in the more pastoral <i>Green</i>, which also stands on its own as a great record. After the main ""Green"" theme comes ""Board Up the House"", a bit of shout-along rock'n'roll with a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a>-like approach to percussive filters and shifts. Elsewhere on this half there's the thorny Fahey-pop of ""Stretchmarker"" and a dose of chewy pop-metal via ""The Line Between"", another possible single. It ends with ""If I Forget Thee, Lowcountry"", an outro like the <i>Yellow</i> opening: We get that slippery, aqueous sound again.</p>
<p>I've always liked the elegance of the group's primary-color schemes-- topical, clearly delineated ways to make each album feel like a whole. Here, more than anywhere else, the colors aren't needed: These songs stick together well without a framework. Tracks play off each other, make echoes, and then go on. Each disc stands on its own as a powerful document; together, they genuinely earn the word ""epic."" During <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYsaZOF1C3A&amp;feature=g-all-a&amp;list=PLBA4F5C8A4E57BFDE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a video interview </a>we did with the band, Baizley joked that you should go for a run, walk your dog, or otherwise take a break from <i>Yellow &amp; Green</i> at the end of the first half, before venturing into the second. The halves do elegantly mirror each other-- each with its nine songs, intro, and finale-- and a pause could make sense. But I prefer listening to the entire thing from start to finish. This is an impressive effort, one that involved a lot of heavy lifting, and it's best experienced with that sort of commitment.</p></div>"|16771.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16771-yellow-green/|8.5|Brandon Stosuy

It's strange to consider even the vague possibility of a centenarian Woody Guthrie living among us; for starters, he always seemed old even when he was young, wizened and weary before his time, by both circumstance and his own design. Despite the campfire accident that crippled his guitar arm in the early 1950s and the neurological ravages of his final decade, Guthrie squeezed a good bit out of his 55 years, almost as if he knew he wasn't too long for this world; he was so prolific-- in words and songs and performances of those songs-- that it sometimes seems like he never left at all.</p>
<p>His odd non-absence has been especially felt in this year. In celebration of his century milestone, the Grammy Museum and the Guthrie Family (which oversees the Woody Guthrie Foundation, which in turn oversees his publications and his archives) have partnered for a spate of concerts and conferences and new releases (14 books, tribute records, and documentaries, at last count). The Smithsonian, which boasts an extensive Guthrie archive of its own, has thrown down, too, with the release of a Folkways box set, <i>Woody at 100: The Woody Guthrie Centennial Collection</i>, which features the most notable of his hundreds of known recorded songs winnowed down to two discs and a third filled with unreleased tracks.</p>
<p><i>Woody at 100</i> may be the most successful attempt to capture Guthrie's sprawling essence, but it's hardly the first. In the decades since his death, Guthrie's songs have been released and re-released in a weird cycle of glut and famine. The endless official and unofficial repackaging of his few dozen best-known songs has been occasionally balanced by the discovery of some old crate bearing thought-lost recordings, mostly of those same few dozen titles, subsequently gussied up and sold as a new entrée into his canon. The full list of Guthrie's known recordings may loom like an ever-swelling crag to all but the most dedicated completists, but all the heft is just a byproduct of the craft. If the bulk of his catalog seems to comprise endless variations on the same four or five dozen songs recorded however and whenever by whoever wanted to give him studio time (and a little cash), that's because this was not only the nature of Guthrie's career but the defining characteristic of folk musicians, especially in the days before the LP was king: making portable, flexible music forever seeking out and open to its audience-- no matter how many vaguely dissimilar versions of ""Pretty Boy Floyd"" it would leave archivists to sort through down the line. (And still, even with Nora Guthrie regularly handpicking artists to transform her father's unfinished works into full-blooming songs, we haven't yet heard it all, and may not ever.)</p>
<p>At 57 tracks, <i>Woody at 100</i> clocks in somewhere between the two most prominent existing Guthrie collections: Smithsonian Folkways' 105-track, four-volume <i>Asch Recordings</i>, which came out in the late 90s, and Rounder's <i>My Dusty Road</i>, 54 tracks recorded for the defunct Stinson label unearthed from Brooklyn basement storage and released in 2009. <i>Woody</i> hits some midpoint, too, between the expansiveness of the Asch sessions and the novelty factor of the Rounder set (which came packaged in a faux-tattered ramblin' man suitcase). The bulk of <i>Woody at 100</i> is pulled from the Smithsonian archives, recorded with Moses Asch or earlier with John and Alan Lomax.</p>
<p>There are the old favorites, the usual suspects: ""Pastures of Plenty"", ""Gypsy Davy"", ""Bad Lee Brown (Cocaine Blues)"", the dustbowl version and the WWII version of ""So Long, It's Been Good to Know Yuh"", the talking blues and the Pacific Northwest odes, the tributes to old sunken ships, and the laments for murdered miners. Twenty-one tracks are seeing release for the first time here, all from radio broadcasts taped in the early 40s; most of the songs are well-known-- ""Tom Joad"", ""Wabash Cannonball""-- but there are six new excavations. Two come from the four tracks thought to be his earliest recordings, made at the Los Angeles radio station KFVD in 1939 (or maybe 1937; the book includes an essay by historian Peter LaChapelle that explores the session's uncertain origins): ""Them Big City Ways"" and ""Skid Row Serenade"" are straightforward enough as Guthrie songs, lamenting the tricky business of urban life (as usual, he sounds more at home on ""Skid Row"").</p>
<p>And then there's the crackly final track, one of the new songs, ""Goodnight Little Cathy"", a lullaby Guthrie cut for tiny daughter during a 1946 session with Asch. The audio quality is not great-- it sounds like it's being played on a Victrola cranked by a ghost in the middle of a sandstorm-- but that seems somehow appropriate. Not long after he made the recording, Cathy was killed in a freak house fire (stunningly, Guthrie's sister was killed, and his father badly wounded, in two unrelated fires when he was a kid). Is there any way this song could not feel haunted?</p>
<p>The real point of <i>Woody at 100</i> may not be the songs at all. The set's three discs come slotted into the back of a coffee table-ready book-- a hefty tome, thick and square as a stack of vinyl sleeves, like a lap-sized Smithsonian tour with its own built-in soundtrack. The pages are sprinkled with Guthrie's ecstatic stick-figure doodles and scrawled snippets of lyrical bric-a-brac (""Take it easy/ But take it,"" one suggests); there's his original lyric sheets typed and handwritten, letters and telegrams, family photos and whole spreads filled with his pen and ink drawings, his watercolors, his etchings, all as loosely-rendered and bitingly specific as his songs.</p>
<p>The book is anchored by a lengthy biographical sketch by co-producer Robert Santelli, the Grammy Museum's executive director (who also penned <i>This Land Is Your Land: Woody Guthrie and the Journey of an American Folk Song</i>, one of the books released for the centennial), and a track-by-track breakdown from Jeff Place, co-producer and Smithsonian folklife archivist. Place neatly fits each song into the scope of Guthrie's career, right down to where and when the tracks were recorded. It's a heroic exegesis, and it's not so much a biography of each song but a genealogy; in the long tradition of folk musicians and the short tradition of a cultural bowerbird, Guthrie was a proud pilferer, borrowing melodies from traditional songs as well as his contemporaries. Place notes each of these instances, from ""Ramblin' Man"" and its tune borrowed from Lead Belly's ""Goodnight Irene"" to the uncountable debts to the Carter Family.</p>
<p>A noted failure of <i>My Dusty Road</i> was the overly tidy organization of its contents into four themed discs. ""The man himself was never so organized; that he could sing a grave union ballad after a nonsensical number makes him seem very real even so many years after his death, despite the pains he took to create and sustain his folkie persona,"" Pitchfork's Stephen M. Deusner <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13778-my-dusty-road/"" target=""_blank"">wrote</a> of the forced compartmentalization. But in the world of <i>Woody at 100</i>, everything about Guthrie's career seems fluid, boundaryless, as if considering him just as a great American musician and not also as a man of letters and a painter, too, has maybe been a huge mistake. (We may get another chance to remedy this: Days before Guthrie's would-be 100th birthday, July 14, it was announced that Johnny Depp, along with author Douglas Brinkley, would be editing <i>House of Earth</i>, his lost novel, for a 2013 release.)</p>
<p>Even within his music, Guthrie himself drew so few solid lines, such as those that usually designate between protest songs and children's songs; in his lifetime he released nearly as many records meant for kids as records of his ""serious"" work, which feels somehow significant, but also like a pointless distinction. ""My Daddy (Flies a Ship in the Sky)"" is a pre-WWII rallying cry (<i>and</i> a lesson in what big people do all day); ""All Work Together"" is a little ditty about helping your mama and daddy with housework (<i>and</i> about banding together despite domestic political disputes to defeat fascism). There's something dark and heavy about being a little kid and something wildly, giddily preposterous about being a grown-up; Guthrie seemed to know this, and it freed him.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's just impossible for me to separate the idea of childhood from the idea of Woody Guthrie, or at least from the idea of his most famous song. Even in his lifetime, ""This Land Is Your Land"" was included in schoolkids' sheet music and taught along the flag-waving anthems it quietly railed against. When his own kids, Nora and Arlo, joined a new elementary school in New York City, they were gobsmacked to find that they were the only ones who didn't know the words. The song was ground into me from the start, too, during every sing-along led by anyone with half a memory of their own childhood spent singing the same song. I was taught the version that on <i>Woody at 100</i> is titled ""This Land Is Your Land (Standard Version)"", the one that skips the beautiful stanza about trespassing, which is included on ""This Land Is Your Land (Alternate Version)"", which opens the first disc: ""Was a big high wall there that tried to stop me/ Was a great big sign that said ""Private Property""/ But on the other side, it didn't say nothing/ This land was made for you and me.""</p>
<p>Hearing those words for the first time, I might as well have been hearing the whole song for the first time. It was like being a child again and realizing that a teacher or a parent is a whole weird complex person extending in every direction beyond the tiny crosshairs your small brain has trained on them, that indeed their entire glorious mass has been shimmering there right in front of your face the whole time but was obscured by either your own smudged eyes or just the huge bulk of its own self-- some unwieldy, unknowable beast you'll keep prodding and pointing at in some hopes of making sense of it someday, maybe in the next century.</p></div>"|16812.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16812-woody-at-100-the-woody-guthrie-centennial-collection/|8.5|Rachael Maddux

Because the soundtrack to our lives is often accidental and serendipitous, comprising random tunes that turn up on the radio, or on shuffle, or in a DJ's playlist at just the right moment, thereby conflating a certain song and a certain shared experience into the best night of your life. But <a href=""http://www.jeffthebrotherhood.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">JEFF the Brotherhood</a> ask: Why leave it all to chance? Why not just reach for a record that's already as up for a good time as you are?</p>
<p>The fraternal Nashville duo's seventh album-- and debut for Warner Bros.-- is their version of celebration rock, if not quite <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16564-japandroids-celebration-rock/"" target=""_blank""><i>Celebration Rock</i></a>. Where fellow two-piece Japandroids' recent second album is a paean to the good times as seen in the rearview mirror, <i>Hypnotic Nights</i> captures the memories as they're being made-- specifically at 3 a.m. in the overcrowded kitchen of a home belonging to some classmate's oblivious, vacationing parents. And from the sound of things, Jake and Jamin Orrall's idea of the perfect house party involves little more than <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer_(1994_album)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Blue Album</a></i> on full blast and a thick cloud of pot smoke. <i>Hypnotic Nights</i> continues with the Weezer worship introduced on 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15452-we-are-the-champions/"" target=""_blank""><i>We Are the Champions</i></a>, but answers the fuzz-pop frivolity with equal doses of motorik groove and psychedelic drone: In the giddy, phased-out thrust of ""Hypnotic Winter"" and bubblegum-covered Krautrock of ""Wood Ox"", you can imagine what kind of record Rivers Cuomo might've made post-<i>Pinkterton</i> had he gone to Cologne instead of college.</p>
<p>JEFF the Brotherhood's concerns are so basic in their everydude needs-- ""I want a place where I can smoke meats/ Where I can drink and swim in a creek,"" Jake offers by way of mission statement on ""Country Life""-- we might as well call them J-Brah. But coming from a band that has just two members and three guitar strings to its name, <i>Hypnotic Nights</i> covers a deceptively wide swath of sonic terrain: Dan Auerbach's production incorporates everything from saxophones and piano to synths and sitars into the mix, mostly to thicken the band's distorto-rock drive rather than provide a respite from it. However, Auerbach does coax an impressively straight-faced performance out of the duo on the mid-60s-styled psych-pop reverie ""Region of Fire"", an effective late-album comedown that makes the closing cover of Black Sabbath's cigarette-lighter igniter <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ-O8emCUXI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Changes""</a> all the more superfluous. Even if it's meant to suggest that every epic bender must ultimately come to a sobering end, the gospel singer-assisted reading is too melodramatic to be introspective, and-- by swapping out the original's piano melody for amateur-hour synth taps-- too half-assed to be taken seriously. Given how well <i>Hypnotic Nights</i> otherwise lives up to its name, the Orralls' ersatz-Ozzy act proves to be an unnecessarily rude awakening. </p></div>"|16831.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16831-hypnotic-nights-ep/|7.0|Stuart Berman

It's a let's-get-down-to-business kind of throat clearing, an aural rolling back of the sleeves before things kick off. And Ikonika really does kick off on <i>I Make Lists</i>. It's an entirely different beast from <i>Contact, Love, Want, Have</i>, which was a highly personal knitting together of her experience growing up on video games and R&amp;B pop, getting into metal and becoming a drummer, and embracing-- and being embraced by-- the then wholly south-London dubstep scene. </p>
<p>Born from memories and echoes of garage, dub, and drum'n'bass, dubstep was the first anti-genre genre and, it can and has been argued, lost its way by becoming a genre. That rigidity is something Ikonika has always been wary of; her music is acutely aware of the limitations of borders. As if to make a point, <i>I Make Lists </i>reaches beyond the London scene to the global club underground she has become a crucial part of over the last couple of years, both as a DJ and owner of the Hum + Buzz label she runs with partner Optimum, releasing records by New York-via-Chicago's Brenmar and Sydney's Dro Carey. </p>
<p>Flight lines, lasers, and firework trails criss-cross throughout the record; it is bold, ballsy and high on adrenaline. There is plenty of acid, funk, gnarly bass, and yet more evidence of Ikonika's wily way with melody and synths that scissor-kick like hyperactive, high-pitched Middle Eastern rhythms. There is a sense that this is a record that would go off in Tel Aviv, in Cape Town, in Mexico City, in Buenos Aires. It also has a kinship with Kingdom's Fade to Mind label in New York as well as with Bok Bok and L-Vis 1990's Night Slugs in London, both proponents of this most borderless of new club music. Most of all, <i>I Make Lists </i>feels free. </p>
<p>Ikonika lives on the outskirts of London, minutes from Heathrow, and it's this proximity to escape, to worlds beyond your own, that throbs strongest on <i>I Make Lists</i>. The album artwork is an aubergine sky filled with paper airplane-like flying objects, fantasy versions of the crafts that cut across the skyline above the purpose-built studio in the garden of her house. Continuing the theme, closing track ""PR812"" is named after a Philippine Airlines flight that was hijacked back in 2000 by a perpetrator who robbed passengers at gunpoint before, incredibly, making his escape by parachute. It's also the most sensually electric track on the record: taut, mournful, and ever-reaching. Which leads us back to the throat-clearing, because ultimately, for all its thrills and spills, <i>I Make Lists </i>is the sound of Ikonika getting ready for her next move.</p></div>"|16867.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16867-i-make-lists-ep/|7.8|Ruth Saxelby

Though still very much electronically inclined, <i>V</i> sounded more rooted in modern rock radio looks, having more in common with, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2872-muse/"" target=""_blank"">Muse</a> than the hip-- and hip-guided-- music their perceived peers were churning out at the time. Said peers all moved on to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15055-zonoscope/"" target=""_blank"">bigger</a> and even more <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15881-hurry-up-were-dreaming/"" target=""_blank"">ambitious</a> things in the time since, leaving the almost completely inactive Van She behind in the meantime. Now four years later, the band returns to play catch-up with its sophomore effort, <i>Idea of Happiness</i>, which does away with the ""rock"" half of the ""electro-rock"" equation in favor of a dance-friendly sound made for island-hopping.</p>
<p>By all accounts, <i>Idea of Happiness</i> sounds like a record that should have come out four years ago. Overwhelmed with tropically inclined rhythms, starburst crescendos, and synths so upfront and sparkly that they feel in need of individual backup generators, <i>Idea of Happiness</i> certainly sounds like someone's idea of bliss, wafting from a disco ball-equipped cabana. Not to mention the fact that the band has enlisted Tony Hoffer to mix the record-- his list of clients includes the likes of M83 and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3305-phoenix/"" target=""_blank"">Phoenix</a>-- which further alludes to Van She's interest in pairing the right amount of bubblegum with slinky new wave. But unlike any of the aforementioned bands, Van She are clumsier around hooks than anything so groove-enabled has any right being. The result is the work of a decidedly B-team kind of band, that at their best can foster good vibes and the occasional moment of melancholic introspection, but more consistently feel like an off-brand amalgamation of fellow artists they've clearly studied and tried to mirror in a casually enjoyable, but ultimately disposable, fashion.</p>
<p>Which is to say that there isn't a lot that you're going to want take away with you after these 40 minutes are through. Still, there is something to be said for its ability to hold your attention while it's on, though perhaps not independently of whether or not you happen to be on a cool boat at the time. Guitars, synths, and beats all sound crisp and glisten with a layer of cold condensation, but they come together in ways that don't necessarily make for memorable pop tunes. Choruses are clunky (""I feel calypso!"", ""Jamaica! The lights are off/ You will be dancing strong, you know it!""), and too often do faint whiffs of fromage tend to overpower these tracks, depending how far downwind from them you are. ""Sarah"" plays like something from <i>Foreigner: Live in Ibiza</i>, while the Cut Copy-cribbing ""Tears"" is skin-crawlingly uncool-uncle funky. Still, they're somehow preferable to plainly forgettable tracks like ""Beat of the Drum"" and the title track, that unfortunately serves as both the album leadoff and first single.</p>
<p>Though there is isn't anything being offered here that you haven't heard before, small divergences prove somewhat fruitful. ""You're My Rescue"" is what might happen if the Duran Duran guys tried their hand at yacht rock instead of merely quaffing champagne on the deck of one, and ""Radio Waves II"" (following up a weirdly proggy ""Radio Waves I"") has a kind of casualness to it that reads as attractively coy, especially in the face of tracks that often come on too strong. It's moments like these where you can't help but admire<i> Idea of Happiness</i> to a degree, but it also doesn't mean it's a record you're going to be taking along with you to your next intimate beachside barbecue, no matter how loudly it asks you to.</p></div>"|16848.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16848-idea-of-happiness/|6.1|Zach Kelly

""Up above the birds, I saw the sky like I never seen before,"" he whispers on his major-label debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47015-frank-oceans-album-is-out-digitally-tonight/"" target=""_blank""><i>Channel Orange</i></a>, as avian chirps surround him. ""You thought I was above you."" The 24-year-old has quickly proven himself to be among the most gifted singer-songwriters of his generation; he's got the type of voice, wit, charm, smarts, and ineffable humanity that's always hoped for, but never promised. And he's got every reason to think he's above the vividly realized lost souls that slouch, preen, and weep throughout his album. But that's not how Frank Ocean works. His lofty gaze is powerful, but not all-powerful. ""What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?"" he sang on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15725-watch-the-throne/"" target=""_blank""><i>Watch the Throne</i></a>'s ""No Church in the Wild"". He's so good at questioning that answers can't help but bubble up in the wake of his words. </p>
<p>Along with Ocean's empathy for his characters is a sense of repose-- he's been there, he's weathered it, and he's come away with his Zen-like calm intact. On <i>Channel Orange</i>, this serene deadpan is splashed with crackling emotion, as though he's alternately narrating and starring in his own <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175880/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Magnolia</i></a>-style cross-wired-heartbreak epic. It's all there on proper opener ""Thinkin Bout You"", where he battles his own brain while reminiscing about a first love. He tells himself white lies in the verse before flipping to a falsetto that could make D'Angelo sweat for the endless wound of a chorus: ""Do you not think so far ahead?/ Cause I've been thinkin bout forever."" </p>
<p>When Ocean dropped <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12271-thinking-about-you/"" target=""_blank"">an early take of ""Thinkin Bout You""</a> on <a href=""http://frankocean.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his Tumblr</a> last summer, it was quickly followed by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16130-thinking-about-forever/"" target=""_blank"">a version</a> from perfectly competent Roc Nation signee <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29844-bridget-kelly/"" target=""_blank"">Bridget Kelly</a>, who claimed Ocean originally wrote the song for her. The fact that Ocean's take dwarfs Kelly's both artistically as well as in terms of popularity is telling. After languishing as a behind-the-scenes writer for pop stars including Brandy, John Legend, and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUDstwjItSs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Justin Bieber</a>, with ""Thinkin Bout You"" Ocean doubled down on the out-of-nowhere success of his unique and brilliant 2011 mixtape, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15172-nostalgia-ultra/"" target=""_blank"">Nostalgia, Ultra.</a>,</i> marking his territory as a performer in his own right. And while he's now primarily writing songs for himself, his time toiling in L.A. studios gave him the experience to create a piece as accomplished and varied as <i>Channel Orange</i>, which swings from Stevie-style keyboard breeziness to 1990s bap&amp;B to mystic psych rock to crunching 8-bit funk without thinking twice.</p>
<p>The ""Thinkin Bout You"" mix-up was telling for another reason, too. As written, it's by-and-large a unisex composition, and the line, ""my eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour when I'm thinkin bout you,"" didn't seem especially revealing since Ocean wrote the song for a woman. In light of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/47067-frank-ocean-opens-up-about-his-sexuality/"" target=""_blank"">the letter he published earlier this month</a>, in which he stated that his first love, at age 19, was with a man, that line-- and others on the album-- gains some personal and historical context. For a culture that accurately prides itself on sonic progression, hip-hop and R&amp;B can be woefully conservative when it comes to sexuality. This is changing, and Frank Ocean is helping it to change, and if his revelation inspires others to understand themselves or the world more fully, then that could be one of <i>Channel Orange</i>'s finest legacies. But it will not be the album's only legacy.</p>
<p>Aside from its bravery, Ocean's letter was, in itself, stunningly written. Its beautiful ambiguities had people reacting with sensational headlines, and then amending those sensational headlines, and then thinking about how and why they personally reacted to such sensational headlines. More questions; more answers. After realizing he was in love with a man, Ocean ""reminisced about the sentimental songs I enjoyed when I was a teenager. the ones I played when I experienced a girlfriend for the first time. I realized they were written in a language I did not yet speak."" And, whether consciously or not, <i>Channel Orange</i>'s language is admirably-- and skillfully-- inclusive. Rather than getting listeners to comb through the lyrics for certain words or references, Ocean mixes things up so well-- and coats the entire affair with heavy doses of disorienting surreality-- that petty pronoun policing is rendered completely useless as deeper meanings reveal themselves at the same time. </p>
<p class=""p1"">While pop is currently in the golden age of exacting self-reflection-- an often beguiling phenomenon spurred on by the internet's infinite mirror-- Ocean is interested in a more selfless pursuit. ""As a lifestyle, you always being the focal point is innately unhealthy,"" Ocean recently told <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/arts/music/frank-oceans-channel-orange.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The New York Times</i></a>. ""I like the anonymity that directors can have about their films. Even though it's my voice, I'm a storyteller."" Those tales are as wide-ranging as they are engrossing, always benefitting from Ocean's eye for detail and specificity. There are sly California class observations in the vein of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Didion"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joan Didion</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/underscore/8786-nilsson-newman-and-some-other-la-weirdos/"" target=""_blank"">Randy Newman</a>, where latchkey ""Super Rich Kids"" can't see past their own one-percent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13843-sweet-life/"" target=""_blank"">""Sweet Life""</a>. But once again, Ocean isn't just sniping easy targets; ""why see the world when you got the beach?"" he asks, a Rorschach test of a hook that leaves its levels of bliss or cynicism wholly up to the listener. </p>
<p>There are plenty of addicts on the back half of the album: the fiend at the center of ""Crack Rock"" whose family ""stopped inviting you to things"" and ""won't let you hold their infant,"" or the poisoned relationship between a dealer and his mule on ""Lost"". On the record's most harrowing cut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13865-bad-religion/"" target=""_blank"">""Bad Religion""</a>, Ocean is crippled by love and left searching for life's answers in the back of a cab-- the string-bleeding ballad finds the singer offering his most impassioned plea yet: ""This unrequited love/ To me it's nothing but a one man cult and cyanide in my styrofoam cup/ I could never make him love me.""</p>
<p>While <i>Channel Orange </i>is stuffed with one-of-a-kind details and characters, its overall scope is grand, as is Ocean's. Tape-hiss interludes bind these very hi-fi songs together with a musty analog quality, and a couple of tracks seem to end mid-sentence, leaving you no choice but to keep going. And there's a timeless philosophy involved here, one of hard-won acceptance and the acknowledgement that love and sex and loss will always draw legends to them. How else to explain <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13733-pyramids/"" target=""_blank"">""Pyramids""</a>, a 10-minute time warp that goes from ancient Egyptian wonders to modern strip clubs and essentially reincarnates one of the most storied female rulers in history as a six-inch-heeled woman of the night. But still, the song doesn't read as an indictment of the last 2,000 years as much as yet another attempt to cleverly level the playing field. </p>
<p>""holding my head. keeping it g [...] whatever 'keeping it g' means to me. i've sorta zoned in on my own definition."" Frank <a href=""https://twitter.com/frank_ocean/status/151811997212741632"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wrote that</a> on December 27, 2011-- the same day he wrote the ""first love"" letter he published last week. Both missives, along with <i>Channel Orange</i> itself, carry the same spirit of confident, open-minded redefinition; he's living in his own world, but also fascinated with what's around him. Currently, <a href=""https://twitter.com/frank_ocean/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his Twitter bio</a> reads: ""i don't know anything. &amp; neither do you."" In Frank Ocean-speak, that's not a statement of ignorance but rather one of wisdom.</p></div>"|16859.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16859-channel-orange/|9.5|Ryan Dombal

<p>Merchandise's conflicted feelings about genre are understandable: One of the most interesting things about <i>Children of Desire</i> is, despite being crafted from familiar parts, how damn hard it is to peg. A cursory blog search will tell you that Merchandise play an amalgamation of post-punk or shoegaze or noise pop or pretty much any confluence of notable indie offshoots that gained momentum during the 1980s, and while you certainly wouldn't be faulted for making similar connections, something about such broad distinctions doesn't do the band justice. Trying to figure out where <i>Children of Desire</i> fits is not only a fruitless endeavor, it marginalizes the ambition that acts as the record's most visible engine.</p>
<p>On their 2010 debut, <a href=""http://katorgaworks.bigcartel.com/product/merchandise-strange-songs-in-the-dark-lp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>(Strange Songs) In the Dark</i></a>, things were a bit easier to sort. Working as a miserablist pop album shrouded in corroded production, it's a record that tries to filter the fog of strife and regret that pepper so many songs about love and youth. But for the players that make up Merchandise, these ideas were rendered in ways that were uncommonly restrained. ""Learn how to sleep without any company,"" Cox dourly croons on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFpBa3oz26I"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""What Was Left Behind""</a>, ""Oh, you're still a young man."" Though the approach still feels-- at least from a production standpoint-- punk-influenced, there's no denying that something more romantically resonant was bubbling underneath. On <i>Children of Desire</i>, a great deal of that suspected brightness has broken through the surface, revealing a borderline anthemic sound that's a leap and a revelation. The hot, swirling guitar feedback that overwhelmed <i>(Strange Songs) In the Dark</i> is no longer front-and-center; here, it's a natural by-product of the wide-eyed magic Merchandise have begun to conjure.</p>
<p>""The music started, I realized it was all a lie/ The guitars were running out/ Last year's punk,"" sings Cox, sounding newly unencumbered on the telling <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdIlsTpf5wM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Become What You Are""</a>, a staggering piece of music and one of two songs on <i>Children of Desire</i> that push the 10-minute mark. It's almost proportioned for an arena, glowing and aching in nearly equal measure. Noisy, decadent, and richly characterized by titanic passes of stinging guitar, it sounds both urgent and somehow elegantly dazed. It's the kind of song you don't want to end (it almost doesn't), briefly breaking down from either exhaustion or bliss (or both) only to ratchet itself back up with a tornado-like intensity that ends up spinning the entire thing right off its own axis. The same kind of energy is more concisely registered on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13672-time/"" target=""_blank"">""Time""</a>, the murderous first single that subscribes to an almost Tears For Fears-like bigness, cut with an undercurrent of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4065-the-smiths/"" target=""_blank"">Smiths</a>-ian longing, all drenched in swaths of sugar-spun reverb. Thanks to its pop-friendly structure, you wouldn't be hard-pressed to conjure up a dozen other equally flattering reference points, but <i>Children of Desire</i> ultimately succeeds thanks to its ability to still sound singular.</p>
<p>One of the smartest moves Merchandise make on <i>Children of Desire</i> is bringing Cox's vocals to the forefront. There's a delicateness in his voice that, by all accounts, should be crushed whole under the weight of how gigantic these songs can be, but there's also a sturdiness in his baritone that brings a surprising but necessary balance. Cox's phrasing makes it clear that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2837-morrissey/"" target=""_blank"">Morrissey</a> has had some sort of an influence on his approach here, like on the driving, industrial-bent cut <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VpjNp-Kq4s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""In Nightmare Room""</a>, which he manages to make sound more like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sQPZ9dD9v8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""I Know It's Over""</a> than whatever<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"" target=""_blank""> Jesus and Mary Chain</a> track you're trying to put your finger on. The fact that he doesn't actually sound much of anything like Morrissey is also an important insight, as Merchandise are able channel influences with some sort of vague kineticism rather than flat-out ape them at nearly ever turn, avoiding the easy missteps that a less intuitive band would make pretty quickly otherwise.</p>
<p>There's little denying that <i>Children of Desire</i> is an ambitious effort. Take <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hEem393xak"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Satellite""</a>, which sounds as if it's practically lifting <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HklplrJxEOY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Suburbs""</a> wholesale and repurposing it as a barroom piano ballad. But watch it then blossom into a radiating, communally drunken waltz. Things like that shouldn't work, but when they do, <i>Children of Desire</i>'s risk-taking reads as crucial, not foolhardy. So it's a bit of a downer that the closing, 11-minute ""Roser Park"" doesn't quite live up to some of the same high-wire tricks that preceded it. You can't help but feel a bit of the air go out of the room, though it's hard not to be a little greedy after being so consistently thrilled. ""Roser Park""-- with its beatific organs and mechanically sharp rhythm section-- would be a gem on most any other like-minded LP. Here, it's merely a reminder that, for Merchandise, the bright lights are most definitely on.</p></div>"|16918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16918-children-of-desire/|7.8|Zach Kelly

Producer Young Chop got himself a deal with Warner Bros., and has moved on to do bigger (if not better) things, namely beefing with Kanye West and working with rappers like Gucci Mane and Big Sean. Then there's <a href=""https://twitter.com/lilreese300"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lil Reese</a>, the Keef sound-alike whose verse has been immortalized on <a href=""http://www.fakeshoredrive.com/2012/05/dbm-x-fsd-present-fredo-santanas-scary-sight-t-shirt.html/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">t-shirts </a>sponsored by the Chicago rap blog Fake Shore Drive. Reese signed to Def Jam this month, and subsequently released his debut mixtape, <i>Don't Like</i>, which is hosted by DJ Drama presumably as a reminder of how intensely focused the rap industry is on these kids. The mixtape will likely get Reese tagged as a Keef reincarnation, and the hallmarks of Keef's <i>Back From the Dead </i>are all here: the horror-score beats, the halting flow, the frighteningly emotionless invoking of violence and the absolute distrust of anyone outside the circle. But Reese isn't a Keef copycat; instead, <i>Don't Like </i>is an extension of their shared aesthetic, and in that sense it's a worthy follow-up to one of the most important mixtapes of the year.</p>
<p>It's also in its own right an important document of the city of Chicago in 2012. Reese and Keef are national figures now, but it's impossible to detach <i>Don't Like </i>from their home city, one with a murder rate so high that Reese (and other rappers) casually refers to it as ""Chiraq."" That is the backdrop that the mixtape is set against, and though looking out for only yourself, your friends, and your family has long been the base worldview of gangsta rap, there is something patently different about the expression of <i>Don't Like</i>. Reese takes Keef's lack of emotion and turns it down a notch even further, routinely blurring the line between rapping and talking. The result are songs that are a string of survivalist mantras. Lines like, ""At the top it's just us, nigga/ But I don't really trust niggas,"" ""I lost so many niggas I turned into a savage,"" and ""Never switch up on your niggas, that's bad for your health,"" hang over the tape even after Reese has moved on. This is a stirring work, powered by beats that are often densely packed with ideas, but it is at its core a group of songs strictly about Lil Reese and his crew outlasting what their environment has made them into. Rarely do they seem enlivened by the task.</p>
<p>A distinction does need to be made, though. Reese is not Keef, and though <i>Don't Like </i>works as street rap zeitgeist, it isn't pop music. As the aforementioned ""Fredo in the cut"" shirts emphasize, Reese has a knack for popping off lines that stick until they are outright slogans. But there is nothing on <i>Don't Like </i>that ascends to the heights of ""I Don't Like"" or ""3Hunna"", the tracks that beamed Keef onto a national stage. His remoteness also doesn't always circle back to charisma the way that it does with Keef. Take, for instance, ""Rap Shit"", one of their two collaborations here. Keef murmurs a chorus that is palpably weary, but he snaps off his lines in a way that conveys  unwavering determination-- you can almost hear him fighting himself. It's the type of starring moment that Keef has a predilection for.</p>
<p>Admittedly, though, there's no real reason to judge Lil Reese by what Chief Keef has done. Both (along with a host of other Chicago rappers) have burrowed their way into contemporary gangsta rap and sliced out their own niche, one that is on the verge of defining the year in both the genre and the city, if it hasn't already. Keef will still get most of the pub, but <i>Don't Like </i>proves with only 10 tracks that Reese can stand on his own.</p></div>"|16927.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16927-dont-like/|7.4|Jordan Sargent

It's a reasonable question to pose at the Brattleboro, Vt., duo of Zach Phillips and Sarah Smith, who on <i>Wink With Both Eyes</i> have produced one of the year's most thoroughly alien-sounding pop albums. It takes four tracks at most to see that; before listening, though, it's worth asking why a band would call itself Blanche Blanche Blanche in the first place. There's something about the linguistic gesture that's relentless, slightly humorous, and exceedingly curious. It's also a not-so-subtle introduction to the fact that Blanche Blanche Blanche very much like to play with words.</p>
<p>The 16-track, fully analog <i>Wink With Both Eyes</i> teems with synth-pop eccentricities. The songs average just over two-minutes, but each is compositionally ambitious, packing peculiar and unexpected shifts in time signature. They end with startling abruptness more often than not; random bits of out-of-nowhere cosmic synths or grainy, antique piano notes roll in from left-field. This is one of Blanche's defining characteristics, second only to Smith's monotone, off-pitch sing-speak tone, which delivers a strange and often nonsensical narrative stream. Lyrics of various tempo are what push the record forward, from whispered and staccato singing styles to comical call-and-response conversations.</p>
<p>Smith and Phillips' words, and their approach to them, render the album cartoonish rather than cinematic, which, it turns out, is especially fun, because Blanche Blanche Blanche know how to do humor without turning their music into a joke. Theatricality is central to <i>Wink</i>, and at times it feels more like listening in on actors in a surreal film than musicians. They didn't use any samplers during the making of the record, which makes the inclusion of audio clips that resemble samples even more amusing. The track ""Body Talk"" is prefaced by what sounds like a clip from a horror movie-- ""What are these twins doing?!""-- and closes with another ""sample"" that could be a rip from a television news report.</p>
<p>The world of Blanche Blanche Blanche is mapped by minimal synth-work with an early-1970s feel, recorded without computers or sequencers, using a Yamaha MT8X eight-track, the same model Ariel Pink used to record the first Haunted Graffiti album in the late 1990s. On the opener ""Results"" the seemingly skeletal instrumentation comes from various directions to bleep, flutter, shush, ping, and bubble, all with an air of subtlety. The singing fluctuates between drawn-out sing-song and a deep, deadpan mutter, before the synths trail off; they're replaced briefly by brightly tuned guitar plucks, over which the mantra ""no, it's never too late"" is repeated 13 times. This is an exceptionally dynamic song, and it all takes place within one minute and 35 seconds. And that's not to mention that the duo's lyrics are a variation on words pulled from an academic handout Phillips received at a conference on sex offender behavioral research, which he attended while working on a cultural anthropology thesis.</p>
<p>The record's definitive moment comes after the uptempo and relatively bright track ""Runny Day"", which conjures the rhythmic feel of running in place or skipping rope, and offers one of the collection's most thematically resonant lines: ""Did you hear the good news/ The good lie/ When you're rich/ You can die."" The song centers on the idea of movement and the vastness of time, which comes out towards the end, when the title is simply articulated over and over, atop a repetitious synth ping, for 25 strangely urgent seconds-- only to drop out, from nowhere, and fall into the title track's quick, anxious, and gray organ washes.</p>
<p>""Wink With Both Eyes"" itself is the record's best track. Though slightly nonsensical, the song deals with daily preoccupation, the idea that blinking through life could lead to failure. Smith describes a dying friend: ""She reached out one more time/ No rhyme could save her life so have mine,"" deepening the pitch and tonality of her voice as the words grow dire. Throughout the track her distracted vocal gestures move from rocket-speed choruses to quick whispers, anxious deadpan, sing-song lines, and a waltz, where the lyrics are quite sad: ""The game is tie/ The players/ They all die,"" and, ""Dying girl/ I'm eternally bummed."" At a point it's obvious she's shutting her eyes to her own humanity.</p>
<p>But laughs abound elsewhere. ""With or Without You"" opens with performative melancholy, as Smith sings, ""I always wanted to be the clown/ People'd come and they'd laugh a while/ Standing ovation so loud/ It didn't make a sound."" Later the song is flecked by a perpetual, collectively shouted hook-- ""With or without youuu!""-- as if culled from a group karaoke session. The duo sounds like it's imitating singers whose vocal capabilities are far greater than its own. Meanwhile, ""Jason's List"" is a twisted, suspenseful track where Smith repeats, ""Die Jason die, die Jason die,"" describing the childhood of a deranged young boy. Similarly, on ""The River"", she sings: ""Thank you, you've been a lot of help/ Go back, go to hell."" And toward the end of the record, ""She's Adopted"" is some next-dimension reincarnation of a romantic 1980s adult-contemporary song, with roaring guitar solos that sound extraordinarily funny within the context of a compressed, analog pop song.</p>
<p>Blanche Blanche Blanche's nonlinear approach reminds me most of how Brian Eno has described his creative process: visually mapping fast-slow rhythms on graph paper, or setting unlikely studio parameters for the sake of unexpected results. With a technically flat sound, but no fuzz or hiss, the entirety of <i>Wink With Both Eyes</i> feels like poetic discombobulation,  considered and unmistakable ambition. And that's why it seems rather unsurprising that <i>Wink</i> is one of <i>five</i> records Phillips and Smith have already released in 2012. The record certainly has its flaws-- its length, for example-- but in all likelihood those will only increase the appeal of Blanche to early fans of pop eccentrics like Ariel Pink and John Maus. While their profiles continue to grow, we're lucky to have groups like Blanche Blanche Blanche, taking the reins and going deep to explore the parameters of electronic pop at its most legitimately peculiar.</p></div>"|16920.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16920-wink-with-both-eyes/|7.7|Jenn Pelly

From transitions and dynamics to concepts and stamina, such a long expanse makes different demands than several three- or four-minute songs, even if they're strung together into a much longer record. A tune that becomes a trek must be cohesive but not complacent, or built on a small set of ideas that can stay compelling without petrifying into boredom. But Portland's <a href=""http://www.agalloch.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Agalloch</a> aren't strangers to the epic or ambitious. For the last decade, they've crafted album after album of seamless grandiosity, surrounding hard-edged black-metal bursts with meditative rests and triumphant rises. Though its 65 minutes came split across six tracks, the band's last release, 2010's glorious <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14920-marrow-of-the-spirit/"" target=""_blank""><i>Marrow of the Spirit</i></a>, was an album in the most unified sense, where each track seemed to bleed into the next and in which repeated sounds and thoughts blotted the entire experience.</p>
<p>While ""Faustian Echoes"", the lone monstrosity on the new EP of the same name, is in fact the longest song Agalloch have ever released, neither its flow nor its shape are foreign to the band's longtime listeners. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/8886-longform/"" target=""_blank"">Based upon Goethe's tale of the mythical scholar</a> who trades his religious servitude for the possibility of transcendence and impossible knowledge, <i>Faustian Echoes</i> keys upon a series of dramatic readings from the text and excerpts occasionally howled by frontman John Haughm. The band lurches in and swells slowly, a theatric exchange between Faust and his literary tempter, Mephistopheles, cutting over a din of electronics and electric guitar. Within the first eight minutes, there is, in sequence, a systems-go blitz, a down-tempo shift, a forlorn drift, a determined build, and a horns-up solo that goads Agalloch back into another blackened onslaught. That's the gist of <i>Faustian Echoes</i>, which ebbs and cascades in prototypical Agalloch fashion; indeed, aside from the lack of track breaks and the addition of tawdry readings, this EP feels only like an addition to the band's catalog, not at all an extension of it.</p>
<p>But <i>Faustian Echoes</i> isn't disappointing because it sounds like Agalloch, even if this does seem like something of a lost opportunity for the band to stretch bounds beyond relative track lengths. Instead, it's a letdown because the fastidiousness that's historically gone into Agalloch albums-- where each layer has its own space, and each musical moment or phrase seems completely developed and considered as part of a comprehensive whole-- is strangely absent. Sure, the heaviest, fastest moments are still compelling, as this remains an unfailingly<i> good</i> quartet captured by ace producer Billy Anderson. But it's hard not to get lost within the instrumental spans or, worse yet, simply to give up on them. The doomy, down-tempo portion that separates the track's first part from its second is laughably rote, with the guitars grinding over cavernous thuds panned across the channels; it's understandable to expect something more interesting from a band with such a pedigree of intricacy. The same goes for the track's more tranquil impasses, which seem like slapdash ellipses that serve only to hinder Agalloch's momentum. </p>
<p>If, <a href=""http://www.hellbound.ca/2012/07/agalloch-faustian-echoes/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">as a few others have posited</a>, <i>Faustian Echoes</i> is a push back toward black metal for Agalloch after <i>Marrow of the Spirit</i>'s well-considered grace, it seems to me less like a conscious move and more like the symptom of a few flawed parts. After all, writing your longest piece to date in an attempt to return to your basics seems like a wrongheaded plan. No, the stumbling block doesn't seem to be the length or nostalgia for the rudiments; Agalloch have mastered more impressive tracts. It's just that the pieces that should link the length together don't.</p></div>"|16928.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16928-faustian-echoes-ep/|6.5|Grayson Haver Currin

There aren't tons of transcendent moments on their four post-reunion albums, and it's unlikely any band will be inspired to cover any of the 52 songs they've recorded since 2002 (unlike their first go-round, when they made such gems that even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2795-moby/"" target=""_blank"">Moby</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0v9a-x45gw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">paid tribute</a>). But there's not a weak second to be found, and each record is winningly relentless. Whenever it seems like time for a lull, the quartet hits hard with another rock-solid tune. In the process they shame more exciting bands who catch fire here and there but can't sustain the same kind of heat.</p>
<p>Ironically, the quartet did shake things up a bit when making <i>Unsound</i>. According to press materials, they switched instruments on some songs and recorded in their rehearsal space rather than a proper studio. You can hear some small differences, most obviously when Bob Weston's trumpet adds some mayhem to a few tracks. But their core sound remains as it ever was: a punk-derived mix of brains and muscle, as obsessed with angles and time-shifts as battle-cry choruses. And they continue to meld three distinct styles: the twists and turns of Roger Miller, the melodic anthems of Clint Conley, and the burly bark of Peter Prescott.</p>
<p>That meld is clear from the start of <i>Unsound</i>, which opens with Miller's slanted riffs in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13351-dust-devil/"">""Dust Devil""</a>, moves into Conley's fluid hooks in ""Semi-Pseudo-Sort-of-Plan"", then dives into Prescott's throaty ""Sectionals in Mourning"". There's still something magical about how Burma can do justice to those three voices-- ones that have proved worthy of sustaining their own bands (see <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27441-volcano-suns/"">Volcano Suns</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/819-consonant/"">Consonant</a>)-- yet combine them into a clear vision. That vision persists through songs that seem repetitive at first, but on closer inspection prove to have intricate layers. Take the Conley-sung <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13752-second-television/"">""Second Television""</a>. The first few times through, I heard it as a basic album-sustainer, but at some point all the small parts and tiny changes revealed something more complex. Maybe all Burma songs are best observed under a microscope-- there's often a world of sonic events and choices inside each one.</p>
<p>And maybe that's why Burma albums are rarely surprising. They're not based on surface differences but on the details buried below. Still, I was surprised by one track on <i>Unsound</i>, which the quartet plants at the end with the ironic title ""Opener"". Slashing through a staircase of riffs, the track is practically an instrumental, save for when Prescott chants, ""forget what you know,"" over and over. That could be what the band intends you to do when you hear it, but it still sounds like Mission of Burma. Even when they stretch, their musical personality is so strong that they end up further confirming their consistency.</p></div>"|16815.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16815-unsound/|7.7|Marc Masters

His outsized pride borders on a sense of persecution. </p>
<p class=""p1"">There's a short list of rap superstars who've truly broken through in the past 10 years, and they are mostly Southern artists. The buzz and eventual hysteria for rappers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2616-lil-wayne/"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a>, T.I., <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4718-young-jeezy/"" target=""_blank"">Young Jeezy</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27649-gucci-mane/"" target=""_blank"">Gucci Mane</a> and most recently <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4880-rick-ross/"" target=""_blank"">Rick Ross</a> make it hard to process K.R.I.T.'s making the ""We make it cool to be Southern"" claim, a slightly altered version of something <a href=""http://allhiphop.com/2005/05/11/master-p-corporate-thuggin/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Master P said</a> way back when No Limit Records was still a formidable label and not just panegyric reference for a <a href=""http://www.supremenewyork.com/previews/springsummer2012/893?image=13"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Supreme hat</a>. There's an army of disgruntled New York rappers (and their more submissive counterparts) who'd argue that it hasn't been cool to be anything <i>but</i> Southern since crunk infiltrated the club scene.

The real problem is that they've seen it before and in many instances in much more potent incarnations. </p>
<p class=""p1"">K.R.I.T. is a very competent rapper whose production style borrows just a little too much from his influences. His sampling chops are stellar but he leans on bluesy bass guitar lines like a crutch. <i>Live From the Underground</i>, in fact, plays like a medley of disparate and once-innovative phases that Organized Noize developed when producing for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3199-outkast/"" target=""_blank"">OutKast</a>. K.R.I.T. begins the album aping Big Boi's ""SpottieOttieDopaliscious"" monologue from <i>Aquemini </i>for his ""LFU300MA (Intro)"". The album's title track is rustic, like something that could have appeared on <i>Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik</i> or Goodie Mob's <i>Soulfood</i>. ""What U Mean"" has the intergalactic bounce of something from <i>Aquemini</i>, and the solemn ""Don't Let Me Down"", which may or may not borrow a chorus melody from the heart-wrenching Beatles song of the same name, sounds like you could tuck it somewhere into the end of <i>Stankonia</i>. </p>
<p class=""p1"">In all fairness, one could do far worse than to idolize 90s-era Organized Noize production. And it would seem those most appreciative of K.R.I.T.'s nostalgia are the people who were around to experience it the first time, including album guests 8Ball &amp; MJG, Devin the Dude, and Bun B. Despite a penchant for rapping over any and everything anyone sends to his email, Bun turns in a surprisingly inspired verse. K.R.I.T. too is as agile as ever, himself an anomaly, a producer worthy of rapping over his own production. But it would serve him well to reach outside of his comfort zone, as rich as his influences may be. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Musically, it's been two very long years since K.R.I.T. broke the scene with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14285-krit-wuz-here/"" target=""_blank""><i>Krit Wuz Here</i></a>, years that have included veritable masterpieces of innovation in both album and mixtape form. <i>Krit Wuz Here</i> itself displayed a great deal of promise, but both its earliest criticism and applause came from the same exact place. We'd heard it before. <i>Live From the Underground</i> shows that not much has changed with Big K.R.I.T. over the past two years. He's still an exceptional rapper with a befitting production style who can make some very good music. It's just that, at this point, good isn't good enough.</p></div>"|16702.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16702-live-from-the-underground/|7.1|Felipe Delerme

Resistant to interviews and elusive of identification, the mysterious French metal shapeshifters are too cloaked to be marketed and too complex to be defined. They splice their orthodox satanic/philosophical black metal surge and cavernous math-rock contortion with enviable technical skills and forcefulness, slamming disjointed parts into one another hard enough for the joints to yield to their will. For the last decade, they've made some of the most fitful and demanding heavy records in the world-- including 2004's <i>Si Monumentum Requires, Circumspice</i> and 2007's  <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/6738-show-no-mercy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Fas - Ite, Maledicti, in Ignem Aeternum</i></a>-- and they've gone out of their way to not be overexposed. They don't play live or do press kits.</p>
<p>But Deathspell Omega did smartly elect to follow 2010's <i>Paracletus</i>-- a masterpiece full-length of aggressive misdirection and instant, infinite tangents-- with two EPs, last year's one track <a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Deathspell_Omega/Diabolus_Absconditus/308507"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Diabolus Absconditus</i> </a>and this year's <i>Drought</i>, a six-song, 23-minute short that is comparatively slight in both scope and power. Consider this a sacrificial effort, then, since most anything that chased <i>Paracletus</i> might have felt like a letdown. <i>Drought</i> certainly does, thanks mostly to its stature and structure. The six parts themselves are good, but they're pieced together clumsily. The lengthy instrumentals that serve as bookends seem simply tacked on, surrounding the other four tracks rather than frame them. Opener ""Salowe Vision"" begins with patience and texture that suggests the intricate paths of <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Brise-Glace"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brise-Glace</a>, as bowed cymbals slink through decaying riffs and gales of background noise. The track builds toward post-rock glory but stops just short of the expected payoff, flatly fading into ""Fiery Serpents"". At least the chaser is itself exhilarating: Built by repeating short rhythmic and melodic phrases and then letting them implode, ""Fiery Serpents"" subtly reimagines the lessons of minimalism within a black metal blunderbuss, a notion not entirely removed from the band that started <a href=""http://www.ifc.com/fix/2011/05/interview-liturgys-hunter-hunt"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a firestorm of stateside ""troo believers"" last year. </a></p>
<p>The abrupt jerk between the first two tracks reflects the real problem with <i>Drought</i>, which, unlike <i>Paracletus</i>, isn't long enough to sweep you into its tide of spasticity or well-built enough to maintain the momentum it sometimes lassoes. The 100-second ""Sand"", for instance, plods behind a repetitive riff, settling into a groove suitable for watching the guitars work overhead; but goofy, ghoulish multi-tracked vocals steal the spotlight just as soon as it's noticed. And just as soon as those have set in, the song-- which feels mostly like an undeveloped bauble, or something the band just had to fit in somewhere-- cuts to ""Abrasive Swirling Murk"", another no-transition jump deep into non sequitur. Closer ""The Crackled Book of Life"" is a brisk instrumental, built on a riff that multiplies until, true to Deathspell Omega anti-form, the song opens into a midsection of glowing keyboards and piercing countermelodies. When Deathspell Omega return for a final, full-volume take on the theme, it feels like a victory lap that's neither deserved nor necessary. It's the simplistic bow on a package that was never very neat at all.</p></div>"|16769.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16769-drought-ep/|6.7|Grayson Currin

He came up under Cypress Hill producer DJ Muggs before producing for late-1990s West Coast backpacker heroes Dilated Peoples. He was soon introduced to Mobb Deep and found his beats in the hands of a diverse array of East Coast street rappers, from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avcBPgUBCJI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nas </a>to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwx2FpoHBA8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CNN </a>to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6TrQzNTrRA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jadakiss</a>. More recently, he's worked with a range of mid-tier rap heroes, from Curren$y to Action Bronson to Freddie Gibbs, and is a reliably creative producer, even if his style of production has shifted away from the hip-hop mainstream. He has also previously released two solo albums (in addition to an EP and several mixtapes), which highlighted an earnest but awkward rapping persona and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of7MB6vNpYY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">more than</a> a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XbDsyCBezA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">few standout</a> tracks. But <i>Russian Roulette</i> takes him in a new direction. It's a producer's album, and that means it predicts the creeping conservatism of an artist who has decided that creating songs is less interesting than creating sonic collages.</p>
<p>The basic structure is a familiar one for those who've found themselves drawn into the insular world of producer-driven hip-hop records by Madlib, MF Doom, and Prince Paul. It's a sequence of instrumentals, each averaging around a minute and a half in length, spliced together with lines of dialogue from records or films taken out of context as if to hint at an artistic or personal philosophy that, we presume, the artist shares. Or perhaps he just thinks they're funny. It depends on how seriously you intend to take him. If you don't take his art particularly seriously, though, it might be a difficult record to enjoy. Sequence is important; promos of the record were sent out as single-track mixes, rather than divided into songs. The message was clear: Much like a DJ mix, there is a method to his madness, a way the artist intends his listeners-- or at least, critics-- to experience his art. Unlike a dance mix, though, there isn't a dancefloor to please, nor is there an overarching pressure to push toward or against populist tastes; the only underlying logic is what Alchemist wants us to hear. As a result, the album takes a meandering path through a museum of different eras and influences and sonic timbres-- all of which, rapping aside, seem to originate in the 1970s or 80s.</p>
<p>A series of rappers does appear on the tape, but it bears little resemblance to the producer's previous two LPs. Alchemist does tend to work with rappers with distinctive rap styles, if not always personalities, which helps keep things buoyant. But too often the rapping on <i>Russian Roulette </i>feels like just another instrumental texture, lacking in purposefulness. More than a few of the rappers, from longtime Alchemist acquaintance Evidence to newcomer Chuuwee, have lyrical approaches that border on filler. Some artists stand apart: MidaZ's flow on ""Don Seymour's Theme"" seems to echo Big Pun's syllable density with an avalanche of spit-stained rapping. Danny Brown, per usual, explodes from the track with a visceral shout-flow. Fashawn might have an overly familiar vocal style, but he also has a well-constructed verse (""This is cloud rap off a loud pack/ Committing foul acts with a wild batch...""). Many of the rappers on the tape seem more interested in sloppily packing together disconnected images and ideas, like Ghostface without the imagination or execution; Boldy James' narcotic delivery stands apart simply for taking his time and completing his thoughts in a straightforward manner. Final kudos go to Big Twin, whose gravelly delivery is almost always a welcome texture on an Alchemist tape, and Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire, whose play on a classic Biggie verse is surreal in a goofily entertaining way.</p>
<p>The level on which <i>Russian Roulette</i> works best is experienced in a stoner's sound-design-obsessed bubble, where each crackle of a record and particular melodic line of a funk, fusion, soundtrack, or novelty sample seems to contain a cavernous importance simply for displacing air with sound. In that way, even the weaker verses seem to have purpose their words can't convey, and many times Alchemist's interest in graphite-textured rappers gives the LP a certain consistency. Rather than falling for the art of songcraft, Alchemist is primarily interested in the pure beauty of those particular seconds of a track that stand out, that one moment, looped to eternity. It's difficult to imagine that everyone will get the same pleasure he does out of each sample. Let's put his odds at one in six.</p></div>"|16922.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16922-russian-roulette/|6.8|David Drake

The show focused on humorously fictionalized versions of the lives of late-1970s musicians like Kenny Loggins, Michael McDonald, Toto, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5826-hall-and-oates/"" target=""_blank"">Hall and Oates</a>. Their music shared a feeling as much as a sound: this was music made by men with long, curly hair and mustaches that were flecked with recently inhaled cocaine. It was from L.A., crafted in expensive studios and played by first-call pros who could fall into a smooth groove at will. The music was rhythmic and spacious and kissed by soul and lite-funk, but it steered away from R&amp;B grit. Though the people making the music lived decadent lives and considered themselves post-60s rebels of a kind, their aesthetic fit perfectly on adult contemporary radio. It's been soothing the souls of office drones in the break room ever since.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Six years later, the LateNightTales series is releasing a yacht rock primer, created by Tom Findlay of the London duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1792-groove-armada/"" target=""_blank"">Groove Armada</a>, of all people. Findlay has put together 18 tracks, performed some light edits, and created some easy-going transitions so the whole thing flows like a single piece. Strictly speaking, the set bobs around the aqua-colored borders of yacht rock proper and touches on singer-songwriter balladry and something approaching true funk. But the laid-back Cali vibes are there throughout, even when the artist in question is from somewhere else entirely. As a unified collection built around an idea, the set succeeds.</p>
<p class=""p1"">However, it's not perfect: The compilation's problems are twofold. Findlay generally forgoes the deep cuts and presents songs that have been on continuous loop in that office break room for 25 years plus. Steve Miller's ""Fly Like an Eagle"", Michael McDonald's immortal ""I Keep Forgettin' (Every Time You're Near)"" (the subject of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnahCol3lXs&amp;feature=player_embedded"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a very funny episode</a> of ""Yacht Rock"", which traced the song's evolution and re-emergence as the beat for Warren G's ""Regulate""), Player's ""Baby Come Back"", Boz Scaggs' ""Lowdown"", Ambrosia's ""You're the Only Woman (You &amp; I)"". Even if these names mean nothing to you, you'll know these tracks when they show up here, such is their ubiquity as background music. And Findlay's edits and transitions can't cover up the fact that we've simply heard these songs too much. He doesn't create a context where we can hear them with fresh ears. The second issue is that, because these tracks are mostly so well known and easily available, this edition of LateNightTales, slight re-touching aside, winds up feeling more like a Spotify playlist than a proper mix that costs money to hear. Which makes sense, given the highly functional nature of the contents: playlists exist for specific reasons and are not by and large about ""expression.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">That said, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this set every time I put it on. Despite the familiarity and easily parodied context of the source material, it <i>works</i>; it does what it was designed to do, probably due to the fact that recording and record-making were at their technological zenith in the late 70s and early 80s. People had component stereos. They wanted music to sound good in their living rooms. The music industry was flush with cash. And multi-track tape recording had finally come into its own as a medium. All of which is to say that the bass, drums, and keyboards of virtually all of these songs are beautifully recorded and mixed, and if you're wired a certain way, hearing them rendered can be in an emotional experience in and of itself. In another few years after these tracks were cut, we'd have CDs and gated drums and the loudness wars. And the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_m8aLVpMxI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">odd yacht rock revivalist</a> track, even when enjoyable, mostly just made you think of what was missing. Say what you will about the denizens of those late 70s studios, but they knew how to record a rhythm section.</p></div>"|16741.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16741-latenighttales-presents-music-for-pleasure/|6.4|Mark Richardson

<p>Hack faith healers, stained glass Saint Peter's, black rainbows, ruby tides, jarred brains, magpies, hoarders, and allied forces licking zigzags while being dragged by horses. Antiquated gentlemen outlaws reduced to a Ferris wheel of vitriol. Miniature Raquel Welches, ghost crabs, butchers in bloody aprons, splintering motordrome walls of death, homemade mummies, bats, crypts, and Chuck Taylors with ""Zulu"" bombed on them in Buckle Font. Dope stone lions and maple donuts. There's no Rosetta to decrypt the <i>Nighthawk Book of the Dead</i> doubling as the mind of <a href=""http://aesoprock.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aesop Rock</a>.</p>
<p>Pick over<i> Skelethon</i> at your own peril. The portmanteau breaks down to the marathon of skeletons. 360 chambers of death, kid. Probably the most logical left turn for the Long Island-hatched rapper who warned <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6BEpiEC7nU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Abandon All Hope"" on his first video</a>: body splayed into a crucified scarecrow, blood and tar on the vocals, words loaned from the inscription above the Inferno.</p>
<p>By 23, he'd died <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCsaBpd8jOk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">1,000 Deaths</a> and vowed to die a thousand more. But time makes the melodramatic seem merely morbid and Aesop Rock is now 36-- old enough to have two eyes on the odometer and a psyche swamp-drained by the disintegration of labels, loves, and all carbon life around him. <i>Skelethon</i> is his sixth album, a retreat into the rabbit hole, the apartment as womb and tomb. Like he says on ""Leisureforce"": ""don four walls like a wooden coat.""</p>
<p>There is no clear autopsy for first single, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46371-video-aesop-rock-zero-dark-thirty/"">""Zero Dark Thirty""</a>, where a ""thousand virtues, kick the same bucket like Chinatown turtles."" This is rap as Rorschach blot. I see it as one-part gentle eulogy for the early 00s underground scene that Rock once ruled, one-part requiem for the naïve certitude that cloaks all teen dreamers.</p>
<p><i>""Roving packs of elusive young, become choke-lore writers over boosted drums, in the terrifying face of a future tongue... Down from a huntable surplus to one.""</i></p>
<p>Few eat off rap infinitely. Def Jux is dead and 93% of the Fat Beats generation scrounges rent money from increasingly rare spot dates, overseas collectors, and rich kids with money to blow on cameo fees. There were even rumors that Vordul Mega of Cannibal Ox was panhandling uptown. Then there are those making dishonest moves to seem current, dudes who once penned purist ""manifestos"" and now collaborate with Ace Hood. Rock phrases it more tactfully: ""folk being backed into what they most lampoon.""</p>
<p>Nine years ago, Aesop Rock swore he'd never write another <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dd_W_x3nclY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Daylight""</a>. That's the closest thing he's had to a hit-- the three ring-hook that's closed out almost every one of his solo shows since 2001's <i>Labor Days</i>: ""All I ever wanted to pick apart the day, put the pieces back together my way."" Had he the desire to simplify his style and stay making off-kilter inspirational anthems for the artistically inclined, he could have been caking off independent coffeehouse baristas for decades. Instead, he created a surly alter ego named<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/66-bazooka-tooth/""> Bazooka Tooth</a> and rapped about train bombers and acid trip adolescence. The Todd Solondz-grim cover of that album didn't help much. Picture a prep school Conan O' Brien Frankenstein in headgear being taunted by grotesque peers. Good times.</p>
<p>From jump, Rock said that he'd sanitize nothing for the sake of contemporary tastes and he's arguably more of a one-man solar system than ever before.<i> Skelethon</i> is his first real album without Blockhead beats. It's also his first without any guest rappers. In fact, the only real cameo is Kimya Dawson, who chants a necromantic hook on ""Crows 1"". Even then, she seems selected squarely because she was the best option to summon the spirits of the witches from Macbeth had they been into anti-folk. If anything, the semiotics have gotten subtler but more vivid. And he wasn't exactly churning out summer jams to start.</p>
<p>So there are no sequels. But ""Zero Dark Thirty"" may be the closest Rock is ever going to get to ""Daylight"" (save for maybe ""Nightlight""). It offers a corollary: what happens when you get to arrange the pieces your way but the puzzle still doesn't fit. He sees ""brown grass [on] both sides."" The moral compass is ""spinning batshit."" He wonders if fans are ""supporting the artist or enabling the addict."" Both songs ultimately reject nihilism for the temporary salve of art. It updates the hero's plight to the present-day: resolved to evolve while retaining his claws. After all, claiming you've ""failed all basic training, but have spent a couple Groundhogs Days with a Changeling"" is really just a clever way to say ""On to the Next One.""</p>
<p>Other songs on <i>Skelethon</i> have spiritual ancestors. ""Fryerstarter"" merges the I Spy-the-LES approach of Float's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orcQKwCMWZk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""6B Panorama"" </a>with the toxic animism of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVhmyFEt3Rs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Basic Cable""</a>. The perspective revolves around Bob's Donuts on Nob Hill in San Francisco, Rock's home city for the last half-dozen years. The song's theme is faith via fried dough (""you can chew the eucharist in cruller form""), surrounded by an all-night zombie parade of insomniac sugar addicts, police, and thieves. While the self-assault of finale ""Gopher Guts"" is the most emotionally raw and confessional that he's been since ""One of Four"", the crack-up that haunted the end of the <i>Daylight EP</i>.</p>
<p>""Leisureforce"" could pass for a less allegorical fraternal twin to <i>Labor Days</i>' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0VQEfbMwb4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""No Regrets""</a>-- the cradle-to-the-grave story of Lucy, an artist who only wanted peace to paint her masterpieces. But rather than celebrate the joys of creation, ""Leisureforce"" catalogues its casual hair-pulling horrors. Yet <i>Skelethon</i> triumphs over those torments. It's the best-written rap album since Danny Brown's <i>XXX</i>, which it resembles in its ability to evoke the self-doubt, sleepless nights, and isolated focus required to finish something great. No surprise considering Brown said that he wrote out the short story raps of Rock's last solo album, 2007's <i>None Shall Pass</i>, to decipher their meaning.</p>
<p>It's always forced when people compare rappers to poets, but fuck it. <i>Skelethon</i>'s imagistic processions of the damned remind me most of Ezra Pound's early <i>Cantos</i> and Allen Ginsberg's ""Kaddish"", their own spiritual brine of burial rites, myths, pop culture, and personal anecdote. While the reaper-stalked motorcycle run of ""Cycles to Gehenna"" achieves the wind-blurred Bay Zen of ""the edge"" in Hunter Thompson's <i>Hell's Angels</i>. If his claims are true and Rock rarely reads, then the influence is smuggled in second-hand via Tom Waits, his closest analogue and one of few admitted influences.</p>
<p>Should the misfits match, consider this Aesop Rock's<i> Swordfishtrombones</i>, a brilliant baleful experiment conducted by an ox-blade throated barker in his mid-30s, with a slant towards occult characters, and off beat percussion. Both share coffee-black humor and a gift for exploring the gopher holes of the underground. The man of<i> Mule Variations</i> would also appreciate the eccentric ghost of Camu Tao, remembered through Rock on ""Racing Stripes"". The ode to odd haircuts describes Tao's contingency plan to pay the rent: shaving his head George Jefferson-style to force himself inside long enough to make beats to acquire the bread to appease the landlord.</p>
<p>All weird scenes stress a recurring theme. ""Grace"" reveals the genesis of a stubborn disposition via the 11-year old Ian Bavitz enraging his dad by refusing to eat his vegetables. It also might be the funniest song Rock's written and a decade-late unintentional response to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTAhSJt_8x8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Be Healthy""</a>. ""Ruby '81"" flashes back to a Fourth of July at five, when a toddler nearly drowned in a swimming pool while everyone was distracted by fireworks. ""ZZZ Top"" initially seems to only satisfy Ghostface's Killah’s basic requirement of tangled slang rap: get some official beats and say some fly shit over it. But upon repeat, you realize it’s the education of the young rebel, carving ""Zoso"" into his desk, ""Zulu"" on his Chuck's, and the Zeroes onto a bathroom stall. It grapples with the moment when childhood dies and permanent angst begins. Yet Rock gracefully dodges preciousness and melon-soft over-sentimentality.</p>
<p>Like Waits, Rock's lyrical gifts and cult-leader singularity often overshadows his musical prowess. Look at this review: 1,300 words on symbols and a paragraph to production. But <i>Skelethon</i> reveals how far Rock's come since the <i>Bazooka Tooth</i>-era, when his beats largely lacked swing and he hadn't yet fully synthesized El-P's industrial influence. His productions now switch between samples and live instrumentation, psychedelic guitars and fright night keyboards, 1980s 808s and beastly drum thrashes. Garage rock riffs married to phosphorescent synths exhumed from the same UFO graveyard as El-P and Black Moth Super Rainbow.</p>
<p>No one would've complained if Rock selected a few Blockhead beats for variety. But he compensates with the natural benefits of being a rapper/producer: these beats are bespoke. The rapping has never been better either, with the music tailored to wring maximum tension out of each bar. Drum slaps dive-bomb then disappear. Piano codas accentuate the disembodied poetics. Rock may claim to be manifestly unfit for the menacing grip of the day, but <i>Skelethon</i> is indelible, pagan torah to his period of exile and emotional maim. Everything dies. Everyone knows. Don't sweat the hieroglyphics, embalm what you can while you're still alive.</p></div>"|16814.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16814-skelethon/|8.2|Jeff Weiss

Five or six years ago, <a href=""http://www.dj-kicks.com/digitalism/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Digitialism</a>'s noisy (but not <i>too</i> noisy) and rocking (but not <i>too</i> rocking) electro house was <i>the</i> sound of indie dance. Back then, folks like Digitalism and Justice were routinely castigated by house aesthetes and techno snobs as barbarians, elevating sensation and riff above groove, and bringing icky rock music values into the club. Heard now, on Digitalism's new <i>DJ-Kicks</i> installment, all the ire this stuff inspired from dance purists at the time just feels kind of quaint.</p>
<p>The world-conquering dubstep, however horribly mutated from its original form, has changed the game when it comes to dance music as parent-annoying ruckus. In the midst of this new dance-meets-rock order, with its nuance-obliterating bass drops and synth buzz like being happily fed face-first into a garbage disposal, Digitalism's blend of slick computer love and a little rock swagger on this mix comes off downright restrained. Music for adults, even, which makes sense when you figure the original French house generation, which is where the Germans of Digitalism get much of their musical DNA, has reached club-avoiding middle-age. Compared to the hounds-of-hell snarling of your most boneheaded dubsteppers, the Digitalism dudes might as well be Derrick May and Carl Craig at their most grown-and-sexy.</p>
<p>You'll get mostly what you'd expect if you have any familiarity with Digitalism or their middle-of-last-decade peers: plenty of narcotically glossy high-speed French house (most of Digitalism's own productions) and druggy slow-motion electro grooves (Tomas Barfod's ""Came to Party"", like raucous ghettotech pitched down to dream-pop torpor). Live-sounding rock drums (the pensive motorik of Grauzone's ""Raum"") trading off with vintage techno rhythm programming (the ticking-to-explosion of TWR72's ""Summer""). And of course riffs galore, even if they now sound finessed rather than game-changingly ugly. The mixing is smooth instead of slamming, but then Digitalism were never really true brutalists, at least not on the level of an act like Justice.</p>
<p>True enough, there are a few jarring transitions of the sort that are unavoidable when you go scene-hopping from track to track. But for the most part the mix is an even-keeled journey to no particular climax. That's a problem if you look for mixes, even home-listening mixes, to have a sense of peaks-and-valleys drama, build over time in intensity, or offer some narrative flow. In 2007, Digitalism and their ilk could feel like a much-needed adrenalized alternative to the arid lack-of-excess that defined the glut of inessential minimal techno. Here they've taken intensity down a notch or two, which often turns this <i>DJ-Kick</i>s into nostalgia-tinged background buzz to while away an afternoon, ambient house with rock sound effects subbed in for the bird-calls and rushing water. As your attention drifts in and out, it can feel as if they've replaced the aimlessness of bad minimal with the aimlessness of defanged pop dance, at which point you might as well just turn on the radio these days.</p>
<p>So it's not that Digitalism have changed up their approach here. At all. One dance generation's populist heroes always become elder statesmen when the next generation of sensation-hungry kids comes along to render their musical values out-of-date. On this <i>DJ-Kicks</i>, Digitalism seem plenty comfortable settling into that role, the thorough professionals rather than the one-time radicals, doing a job without offering many surprises along the way. Then again, one remix here is labeled the ""Digitalism electroclash mix."" In 2012, using the word ""electroclash,"" without a hint of irony, is pretty much shorthand for ""stuck in a rut and not really unhappy about it.""</p></div>"|16824.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16824-dj-kicks/|5.5|Jess Harvell

I'm talking folk music, modern pop made with synths and drum machines, and the music recorded to cassettes during the long dictatorship of the Derg from 1974 to 1987. Even so, I didn't really know what to expect when I first put on the debut from <a href=""http://deboband.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Debo Band</a>, an 11-piece Boston band that's billed as putting its own unique spin on Ethiopian music, a spin that covers that same gamut rather than simply going to the <i>Ethiopiques</i> well.</p>
<p>The band acquits itself amazingly well, mixing in a few originals with a well-chosen selection of Golden Age songs, folk tunes, and Azmari troubadour songs. They don't limit themselves to a faithful homage to the music. Ethiopian music's reliance on pentatonic scales and modes makes it harmonically compatible with a wide array of other folk music, and even if you've spent hours listening to Mulatu Astatke and Alemayehu Eshete, you'll hear plenty of fresh ideas here, as the band spikes its arrangements with hints of Romany brass and even Celtic melody.</p>
<p>Those moments are flourishes, though, building off a style born of the distinctive sounds of one of the oldest countries in the world. The band is led by ethnomusicologist Danny Mekonnen, an Ethiopian born in Sudan and raised in the U.S., and its vocalist is French-raised Ethiopian Bruck Tesfaye, who sings powerfully in Amharic, the language whose rhythms this music was primarily built around. They've taken their instrumentation in an adventurous direction, giving their horn section a huge low end with sousaphonist Arik Grier and incorporating electric violinist Jonah Rapino and acoustic violinist Kaethe Hostetter (Hostetter has established her own music school in Addis Ababa). Guitarist Brendon Wood also adds a highly original voice to the music. His wild psychedelic leads on ""Habesha"", ""Asha Gedawo"", and ""Ney Ney Weleba"" sharpen those songs' already wickedly funky edge.</p>
<p>All that is what makes Debo Band far more than a genre exercise. These people have clearly spent time in this rhythmic and harmonic world and learned how to use the vocabulary not only to play the music, but to expand it. Tesfaye's pleading, intense vocal on the group's spare arrangement of the traditional ""Medinanna Zelesegna"" owes a debt to Tlahoun Gèssèssè and other powerful Ethiopian singers of the past, but the way it mingles with Hostetter's melancholy, drone-based violin part doesn't. Likewise the thrillingly dissonant climax of ""Habesha"" and the snaking accordion solo that follows it. It's not an easy feat to pay tribute and transcend that same tribute simultaneously, but over the course of their debut, this band manages the trick. As I said, I've listened to a lot of Ethiopian music. Debo Band may be from Boston, but this album leaves no question that they deserve to be included in that count.</p></div>"|16847.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16847-debo-band/|7.8|Joe Tangari

And that's just another day at the office for Borcherdt and his band <a href=""http://holyfuckmusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Holy Fuck</a>, whose juddering synth-rock is just funky enough to land them regular bookings at EDM festivals. But it's a circumstance that would've seemed preposterous 10 years ago, when Borcherdt first settled in Toronto after moving from his native Nova Scotia. Back then, Borcherdt was first and foremost Leslie <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1622-feist/"" target=""_blank"">Feist</a>'s replacement in Toronto power-pop perennials <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIDp_M1XhV4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">By Divine Right</a>, whose membership also once included a pre-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/475-broken-social-scene/"" target=""_blank"">Broken Social Scene</a> Brendan Canning. But, having also launched his own label, Dependent Music, back home, Borcherdt proved to be the industrious sort who threw himself into all manner of recording projects and concept bands; Holy Fuck-- originally a one-off experiment built from effects-pedal loops and film-projector noises-- was the one that just happened to stick, and lent him a steady touring gig that took him beyond Canadian borders.</p>
<p>But throughout all this, Borcherdt has stuck to a rigid exorcise regimen, releasing solo albums of unflinchingly intimate and confessional lo-fi indie pop, the first of which, 2002's <i>Moth</i>, was written in response to the sudden passing of a close friend. The scepter of death-- and the cruelly fleeting nature of life-- has haunted Borcherdt's solo work ever since, as indicated by the monikers he's adopted over the years. In 2004 to 2005, he released two albums as the Remains of Brian Borcherdt; the name attached to his latest project, Dusted, takes that theme of post-mortem decay to even more literal, unnerving extremes.</p>
<p>Technically, Dusted is a duo endeavor with Leon Taheny, aka <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6803-owen-pallett/"" target=""_blank"">Owen Pallett</a>'s go-to producer, and drummer for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1234-death-from-above-1979/"" target=""_blank"">Death From Above 1979</a> stickman Sebastian Grainger's side band, the Mountains. But <i>Total Dust</i> undeniably taps into the same raw-nerved emotion that defined Borcherdt's previous solo efforts, wrapping its cutting sentiments in a grotty guitar fuzz that sounds like it was scraped off the heads on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/586-lou-barlow/"" target=""_blank"">Lou Barlow</a>'s old four-track.<i> Total Dust</i> is an album that's consumed with mortality, the fear that ""something could go wrong,"" and the imperative of making the most of your time here. But in Taheny, Borcherdt has found a worthy foil who can help him steer clear of sad-bastard solipsism, introducing luminous textures that lend these recordings a greater sense of space and levity: The mid-album moper ""Bruises"" may boast Borcherdt's most disaffected vocal on the record, but the song's desolate chill is gradually leavened by sunrise-summoning synths and trippy tremolo effects, while the plaintive ""Pale Light"" cuts through its surface griminess with spirited violin sweeps.</p>
<p><i>Total Dust</i> is a record of subtle gestures, to be sure-- the slow-creeping rocker ""Property Lines"" is the only thing here that sounds like it was meant to be played outside the bedroom. But the album's exploratory ethos manifests itself in Borcherdt's own performances, which see him oscillating between a conversational monotone and childlike coo, bringing a refreshingly playful quality to what could be a sullen songbook: while ""(Into the) Atmosphere"" grimly implies we're all destined to be reduced to airborne particles, its helium-high hook and spirited shuffle suggests a corner-busker version of the Flaming Lips. If Borcherdt has spent much of his solo career staring down the inevitability of death, on <i>Total Dust</i> he sounds more accepting of that fate. ""I'm not sure how long it'll last... the whole thing could collapse,"" he admits near the album's end, but his chill, cheery demeanor suggests he's happy to let the pieces fall where they may.</p></div>"|16827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16827-total-dust/|7.3|Stuart Berman

His style of ambient electro-pop hums with quiet urgency, belying its dreamy pace and softly blended pastel tones. This self-therapeutic approach to music might explain Lacey's high yield: This is the third Arrange review I've written in the span of one year. But his productivity is tempered by an uncommon degree of thoughtfulness in the construction of his releases-- he never phones it in. Each record retunes the balance of elusion and revelation. <a href=""http://arrange.bandcamp.com/album/new-memory"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>New Memory</i></a> is the boldest version of Lacey's sound to date, though just by a hair, fitting his track record of growth by dogged increments.</p>
<p><i>New Memory</i> is consistent with prior albums in its methods of imparting restrained turmoil and distressed beauty. Tenderly pulsing soft synths gravitate toward near-vocal timbres. Their fluent eloquence is a rather ingenious way for Lacey to offset his halting manner of confession and the dignified limp of his rhythm programming. Distant nature sounds flow around the melodies and runaway reverberations engulf them, but sweetening traces of guitar and piano make the drift feel purposeful. In its plentiful transitions, the music gently shreds like tissue underwater and delicately reforms. Lacey deploys his voice judiciously, frequently displacing the emotive peaks onto one of his languid synthesizer solos, etched in the tracks like glowing signatures.</p>
<p>A cursory listen might divulge more of the same for people without my apparently inexhaustible taste for Arrange. But closely following the project this past year has been like watching a picture develop very slowly, a small figure resolving more clearly in the smear of landscape. On prior records, the singer/songwriter quotient was often buried, almost apologetically, under nocturnal ambiance, if not simply banished to make way for instrumentals of striking emotional clarity. These are still important facets of <i>New Memory</i>, but the reticent aura Lacey holds around his singing and songwriting dissipates considerably. This is particularly affecting to witness from someone whose music so often deals with shame.</p>
<p>On a purely technical level, Lacey has gotten better at recording himself, capturing fine textures and clear shapes that were sometimes diffused in blown-out distortions on <i>Plantation</i>, though it didn't harm to songs as indelible as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12207-whend-you-find-me/"">""When'd You Find Me?""</a> and <a href=""http://arrange.bandcamp.com/track/tiny-little-boy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Tiny Little Boy""</a>. More importantly, the relative exposure of Lacey's lyrics reveals them to be even more unnervingly private and distinctively sung than before. The record's leitmotif is hands, often Lacey's own, which on ""Caves"" are said to be ""porous things/ Filled up by anyfing."" This is an inexplicable accent for a young South Floridian-- who also sings ""with"" as ""wiv""-- but it's strangely appealing. It's like a negative image of Jeff Mangum's voice, the diction deformed by internal pressures, but excessively hushed and clipped rather than loud and elongated. </p>
<p>Two songs in particular will seem brave or embarrassing according to your temperament, which is why they strike me as brave. After dealing with his relationship with an incarcerated father on <i>Plantation</i>, Lacey directs the denuded benediction ""Where I Go at Night"" to his mother, pouring his heart out through a clenched jaw. The best part is how pathos turns to delight when the misty piano suddenly leaps into a pertly gated synthesizer, a prime example of Lacey's knack for drawing dark and light into unity. The upbeat conclusion adds rhetorical force to the words of healing. Meanwhile, the title track is a spoken-word performance where we can fully appreciate the natural resonance of Lacey's voice as he exhorts himself ""past my own insecurities and rage"" to eventually concede, ""I can't create a new person/ But I'll create new memories.""</p>
<p>In a <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1262217745/help-get-arranges-new-mini-lp-new-memory-to-vinyl"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video</a> promoting the successful Kickstarter campaign to crowdfund the vinyl edition of <i>New Memory</i>, Lacey spends most of his time self-consciously mugging for the camera rather than brooding in shadow, the stock image that would go with his music. What he has to offer is a particularly unvarnished kind of ingenuousness, quite distinct from the more common and flowery varieties, paired with a sensitive touch for making computer music move in free-feeling currents. He's still not flashy enough to be a buzz band. Instead, and hopefully for a long time to come, he holds an intimate space in a clamorous musical marketplace, with a potentially lethal earnestness that becomes a virtue by dint of his humility and honesty.</p></div>"|16807.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16807-new-memory/|7.8|Brian Howe

After all, though Longstreth had been releasing music as Dirty Projectors for years, the band finally inched toward a critical mass in 2007 on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10577-rise-above/"" target=""_blank"">an album that reinterpreted</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/"" target=""_blank"">Black Flag</a>'s <i>Damaged</i> from memory. The album found Longstreth replacing Rollins' gruff bellow with alien, elastic vocals, anchored to the zigs and zags of West African guitar. Two years later, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13159-bitte-orca/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bitte Orca</i></a> used a trio of female vocalists-- mainstays Amber Coffman and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27671-deradoorian/"" target=""_blank"">Angel Deradoorian</a> and newcomer Haley Dekle-- to bait often abstruse arrangements and hard-to-parse lyrics. When <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3503-uestlove/"" target=""_blank"">Questlove</a> posted <a href=""http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2009/09/dirty_projector_22.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a backstage video</a> of the Projectors performing an unplugged ""When the World Comes to an End"" after a ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon"" appearance, internet commentators concurred that people simply shouldn't be able to sing like that. Between the intercalated harmonies, Longstreth's own sometimes-stringent tone, and his counterintuitive approach to guitar, Dirty Projectors occasionally could be reduced into a menagerie of eccentricities-- possible to enjoy, but sometimes difficult to internalize.</p>
<p><i>Swing Lo Magellan</i> should help rectify that: The band's least ornate batch of songs to date builds upon Longstreth's most direct and identifiable lyrics ever. Which means that Dirty Projectors have upped their emotional and structural accessibility all at once. Culled from a batch of roughly 40 demos, these tunes explore vulnerability and vexation, sweetness and cynicism with more manageable musical complications than ever before. For instance, the gorgeous ""Impregnable Question"" finds the seam between <i>Heart of Gold</i>-era <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young</a> and late-1960s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4810-serge-gainsbourg/"" target=""_blank"">Serge Gainsbourg</a>; it's a love song between Coffman and Longstreth, her coos helping him to soften his voice above a warm acoustic shuffle. Over handclaps and a ragged, wrapping riff on ""Dance for You"", Longstreth offers one of his most intuitive and immediate hooks. There's gusto and playfulness here, too, from the way Longstreth clears his very-warped throat before launching into the first verse of opener ""Offspring Are Blank"" to the brilliant decision to record Coffman and Dekle mocking some of Longstreth's most impenetrable lyrics toward the end of the irrepressible ""Unto Caesar"". When he sings ""Down the line/ Dead, the martyrs' morbid poetry,"" Coffman teasingly answers, ""Uhh, that doesn't make any sense, what you just said."" You want to be in the room with this band. </p>
<p>There's also a folk-song seriousness at work on some of the standouts, especially the tragic ""Just From Chevron"". Structured so that Coffman and Dekle play the part of a Greek chorus while Longstreth sings the dying narrator's plight in soliloquy, the song is a fitting one for this year of <a href=""http://www.woody100.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Woody Guthrie centennial</a> celebrations. <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2012/03/21/chevron-calls-brazil-oilspill-lawsuit-outrageous/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chevron-- or any company, for that matter</a>-- has brainwashed its employee so that, as he lays dying due to their own mechanical failure, he needs his love not to know that he loves her but that his death is worthwhile, because it's part of the company's quest to power the world. A devastating fact in a field of general abstraction, it's as poignant and profound as anything Dirty Projectors have ever released. The title track works a similar mode, with its buttoned-up rhythm section holding steady alongside lyrics about the clutches of conformity and the liberation of self-reflection. ""In the grid, aware their position,"" Longstreth sings, any possible scorn swallowed in genuine worry. ""Unconcerned with intuition.""</p>
<p>That's not to say that all of these arrangements are exactly intuitive. After all, this is still Dirty Projectors, and this is still an album whose first single, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13379-gun-has-no-trigger/"" target=""_blank"">""Gun Has No Trigger""</a>, is an unnerved look at the way things might have been and whose rhythm doesn't shift once. The tricky meter that underpins ""About to Die"" is quintessential Dirty Projectors, as are the two-part harmonies bouncing against Longstreth's young-love paranoia. ""Maybe That Was It"" even inches toward psychedelic rock. Longstreth's falsetto comes refracted through a web of effects, providing a suitable counter for the Crazy Horse-like stumbling stagger and craggy electric lead. Even the straightforward Dirty Projectors are still a mighty complex unit.</p>
<p><i>Swing Lo Magellan</i> is a confident step into the spotlight that neither depends upon public expectations nor shies away from them. It's well-made but certainly not over-produced, idiosyncratic and intricate but very rarely obtuse. But as compelling as these tunes and these performances often are, what's most intriguing about <i>Swing Lo Magellan</i> is the way it suggests that, even after a decade, we still don't know everything about Longstreth or his band. If, in the past, he or they sometimes seemed like a freak show, they come toward Earth just enough here to feel like a proper rock band working in service of songs about love and confusion, anxiety and celebration.</p>
<p>In a society of by-the-second news updates and endless information all the time, it's strangely reassuring to feel as if a songwriter who's been endlessly interrogated, analyzed, and publicized is still something of a stranger. Longstreth himself seems to serve as the narrator of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13766-dance-for-you/"" target=""_blank"">""Dance for You""</a>, an ebullient account of an odyssey for a grail that exists but has yet to be found. ""There is an answer,"" reckons Longstreth, his voice rising optimistically over film-score strings. ""I haven't found it/ But I will keep dancing until I do."" This far into a career, that's a good thing not only to hear a songwriter sing but a mantra to hear him create by, too.</p></div>"|16806.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16806-swing-lo-magellan/|8.8|Grayson Currin

His precise self-presentation is hard to reconcile with that stark, ungainly voice. What sort of creature is that supposed to be? The singer's internally turbulent blankness was the catalytic agent in Interpol's modern classic, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4113-turn-on-the-bright-lights/""><span class=""s2""><i>Turn on the Bright Lights</i></span></a>, which they started to work on in November 2001. When it came out the following year, its overlays of urban-apocalyptic vision and made a visceral kind of sense: Banks sounding stunned with emotion amid his band's massive architecture.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Interpol were quickly elected avatars of the post-9/11, Brooklyn-centered post-punk boom, an improbable moment when it seemed like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26609-echo-and-the-bunnymen/"">Echo and the Bunnymen</a> were more influential than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8275-the-rolling-stones/"" target=""_blank"">the Rolling Stones</a>, which was immortalized in a <i>Believer </i>article called <a href=""http://www.believermag.com/issues/200303/?read=article_derby"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Well-Dressed Men Sing Songs for Oblivion""</a>. But the moment passed, and Interpol ceased to feel inevitable. Though they still technically exist, it's hard not to think of them in the past tense. Whether Banks' elusive persona will be interesting to listeners in other contexts is an open question. It wasn't resolved on his capricious solo debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13224-julian-plenti-is-skyscraper/""><i>Julian Plenti Is… Skyscraper</i></a>, and it isn't resolved on <i>Julian Plenti Lives…</i>, a perfectly decent if rather bizarre teaser EP for an impending follow-up. Those ambivalent ellipses are spot-on. We still have no clue what this project is really about or who Julian Plenti is, let alone Paul Banks.</p>
<p>The EP consists of two originals and three covers seemingly plucked at random. Opening instrumental ""Perimeter Deactivated"" is a driving version of a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n65rPfMGS4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Harold Faltermeyer theme </a>from the 1987 Schwarzenegger film <i>The Running Man</i>. ""Mythsysizer"" is a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-blxwMxuAcY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">J Dilla cover</a> with concussive guitar chords and swirling pianos. ""I'm a Fool to Want You"" is a fairly straight Sinatra cover with-- why not?-- a light trip-hop undercarriage, and comes off about as well as that possibly could. There's also an original instrumental that sounds like a less-funky <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3638-ratatat/"">Ratatat </a>cribbing riffs from ""Float On"". You could be forgiven for wondering what in the hell is going on. Let's hope that these confusing covers are just filler to round out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13802-summertime-is-coming/"">""Summertime Is Coming""</a>, which would form an intriguing basis for the new Julian Plenti album.</p>
<p>The liquid guitar line of ""Summertime"" is enticingly familiar-- a welcome reminder in all the hodgepodge that Banks' music has specific good qualities. The lyrics range from flawlessly vacuous to genuinely affecting-- ""Is this the right time to know me?""-- though if you're dead-set on finding a quotable clunker, ""You're sweet like a peach on the beach"" will do fine. The Flaming Lips-like acoustic outro is at once daring, awkward, and moving-- startlingly personal, even. The song's success relative to the instrumentals says two things. One: Banks does have substance. Take him out of the music and the spirit goes. Two: Interpol's power derived, to a perhaps underappreciated degree, from musicianship. They knew how to control tempo and pace, especially with former bassist Carlos Dengler's stately but kinetic touch. For the Julian Plenti LP, a little less Logic and a little more playing and singing would go a long way.</p></div>"|16707.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16707-julian-plenti-lives-ep/|5.2|Brian Howe

For one, guitarist/vocalist Jennifer Moore's prickly, palm-muted chord progressions and occasional yelps conjure the jaunty post-punk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1273-delta-5/"" target=""_blank"">Delta 5</a> or Swiss art-punk pioneers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/13570-kleenex/"" target=""_blank"">Kleenex</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2484-liliput/"" target=""_blank"">LiLiPUT</a>. In another way, there's a general sense of smallness about this music-- it feels simple, compact, restrained. But Moore and drummer Adam Jones do minimalism so well that it's this very smallness that makes them stand head and shoulders above plenty of less-distinct post-punk revivalists. Deep Time go against the current indie grain of smoke machine atmospherics and stadium-sized dreams in favor of something much more streamlined. The nine songs on their self-titled album are well-designed contraptions, as simple, madcap, and proudly anachronistic as Rube Goldberg machines.</p>
<p>The subject matter of their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13865-yellow-fever/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a> as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28577-yellow-fever/"" target=""_blank"">Yellow Fever</a> (they changed their name after one of those lawsuits that makes you wonder if there are actually any band names left) occasionally felt small to a fault. The tunes were as catchy and amiable as an early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/531-beat-happening/"" target=""_blank"">Beat Happening</a> record, but Yellow Fever weren't exactly plumbing deep thematic waters. Singsongy and sweet, songs like ""Cutest"" played out like nursery rhymes for scene kids: ""My brother and me went to a show/ And we saw everyone we know."" But Yellow Fever never drowned in their own twee-ness; instead they captured something about the sense of belonging that comes from living in a small town where everybody's on a first name basis (""Donald"", ""Alice"", and ""Donovan"" played out like odes to the people next door). Its homey charms played on a simple, timeless premise: Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name.</p>
<p>Much of what makes Deep Time feel like such an undeniable step forward, though, is the darkness that's crept into these songs: You no longer get the sense that they're taking place in Pleasantville. ""Coleman"" paints an unsavory domestic scene of ""dirty sinks and sandy food,"" so no wonder Moore sings of the central character, ""You never go home."" <i>Deep Time</i> is preoccupied with all sorts of shadowy feelings-- loneliness, disillusionment, and homelessness-- and its militant lockstep beats; cartoon-spooky organ riffs; and bristly, dissonant chords mirror this vibe. A few of the narrative-based songs here are still named for characters (""Sgt. Sierra"", ""Gilligan"") but this time they're far from home, and the neighbors aren't exactly bending over backward to keep the search party going. ""The gas is gone and the plane is out of control,"" Moore howls on the eerie ""Bermuda Triangle"". ""Are you sure they're searching still?""</p>
<p>Moore's voice is versatile (pivoting between a low drawl and a canine howl on the slithering earworm ""Sgt. Sierra""), expressive, and distinctly cool. There's occasionally some black comedy in her phrasing (the way she breaks up ""I'm sleeping with the/ Fish"" gives the lyric an unexpected punchline, and a pretty dark one at that), or some emotional resonance in the smallest details (""I'm leaving home and I want you to know/ I'm leaving home and I want you to no...tice""). Every detail on <i>Deep Time</i> feels deliberate, which makes it more arresting than plenty of records that make a lot more noise. There's power in pauses, silence, and empty space, these songs affirm, and small doesn't have to mean slight.</p></div>"|16808.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16808-deep-time/|7.7|Lindsay Zoladz

In the process they try on styles, old and new alike, to see which fit best. They make wild stylistic leaps from album to album with only <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5173-tracey-thorn/"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Thorn</a>'s warm and wounded and utterly unflappable voice to provide a link between them. Do all of those change-ups work? Of course not. It'd be surprising if every move the young EBTG made <i>did </i>work. The road to the mature (and often very different) music that made EBTG global stars in the 1990s was unsurprisingly filled with the expected false-starts and dead-ends.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's equally surprising how assured and sophisticated much of this music remains, along with being intermittently moving and sometimes just undeniably catchy, albeit in a very dated way. This was a duo with a history in the earliest days of ramshackle UK indie pop, the moment just after post-punk that prided itself on peppy primitivism and emotional vulnerability. But from EBTG's debut album, 1984's <i>Eden</i>, it was clear that a creative life built around cutesy C86 sloppiness didn't much interest Thorn or partner Ben Watt. This is indie pop after it's been sent to finishing school, and the album plays out as one bittersweet swoon.</p>
<p>There's plenty of breezy Brit guitar jangle on <i>Eden</i>, but even that's played as smooth as possible. Thorn's smoky, stately singing transformed what might have been twee and childlike songs into something weirdly world-weary and cosmopolitan. Watt proves himself an adept student of retro styles here, mostly by avoiding the hubris of imagining himself as a big-band leader, using jazz horns and politely shuffling Latin rhythms as unexpected bursts of color. The only time he really flubs is on ""Crabwalk"", a tight-assed reverential jazz instrumental that less recalls the cinematic cool of Gil Evans than soundtrack filler in a kitchen-sink melodrama. The bonus tracks are fittingly all of a piece with the rest of the album, but special shout to the proto-dream pop, complete with angelic multi-tracked backing murmurs, of ""Easy as Sin"".</p>
<p>The world EBTG created on <i>Eden</i> was so <i>pleasant</i>, even at its glummest, that you wanted to linger there a while. 1985's <i>Love Not</i> <i>Money</i>, however,<i> </i>was a near-total reinvention and a complete stylistic mish-mash. One on hand, guitars came coated with about nine pounds of agreeably dated glitz, like the gaudily anthemic college rock being peddled by bands like the Icicle Works. On the other hand, it's the most soporific and studiously ""serious"" album EBTG ever made, and parts of it are a real drag. The murky, cavernous stuff assumes that droning on depressively is the best way to handle weighty topics, and some of the new touches, like the Celtic kitsch of ""Sean"", with ultra-kitschy tin flute, are so ham-fisted you'll cringe.</p>
<p>Yet EBTG's blunt if heartfelt seriousness really could be affecting when married to the kind of blissful tunes they did so well. At its infrequent best, <i>Love Not Money </i>plays the dreaminess of 80s soft-focus indie against the stark Reagan/Thatcher reality that so much 80s pop was rushing to avoid. And there are hints throughout that they could have pulled off the dark stuff, too. Built around Thorn's show-stopping, soulful, slow-burn of a performance, ""This Love (Not For Sale)"" is as epic a torch song as EBTG would write until the 90s, where 80s quiet-storm signifiers (that saxophone) meet an almost <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25136-talk-talk/"" target=""_blank"">Talk Talk</a> level of attention to sonic detail. The bonus tracks are an equally mixed bag, ranging from a stripped-back piano backing track for another excellent Thorn showcase, ""Charmless Callous Ways"", to ""Easy as Sin"", another attempt at a radio-friendly indie anthem that never quite achieves lift-off.</p>
<p>By 1986, many of EBTG's old post-punk contemporaries had scored big by embracing 80s pop radio's monumental mix of canned funk and total schmaltz. At the same time, ""adult contemporary"" values of classiness, composure, and old-school glamor had taken over pop as a whole. The same year's <i>Baby, the Stars Shine Bright</i> was the EBTG that felt like it had completely divested itself of any remaining trappings of rock, punk or otherwise. Along with having the biggest hooks they'd come up with yet, <i>Baby </i>is also the best of these four albums because they really commit themselves to its faintly cheesy opulence, sweeping <a href=""http://www.nelsonriddlemusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nelson Riddle</a> strings, and perfectly manicured horn charts.</p>
<p>After all, you can't sell a song with a title like ""Don't Let the Teardrops Rust Your Shining Heart"" by half-measures, and the music is as lush anything from the big-money era in which it was recorded, even if the lyrics betray a deep suspicion of the triumphal conservatism and creeping fascism that was the flipside to so much of the decade. Heard with 21st-century ears, what it most reminds me of is a <i>very</i> 1980s version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1931-matthew-herbert/"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Herbert</a>'s forays into big-band jazz and film scores, right down to the mix of old-school sonics and current tech, love songs and political commentary. Aside from a few supper-club snoozers, <i>Baby </i>is full of great and almost-forgotten 80s pop gems like ""Don't Leave Me Behind"", every ultra-bright piece of which sounds unashamedly stuck in its moment and all the better for it. The bonus tracks tend to stick to supper-club mode, though there's an even more momentous extended mix of album opener ""Come on Home"", and a few curious home-recorded demos that suggest what a lo-fi take on 80s big-biz pop might have sounded like.</p>
<p>All that excess and drama was gone by the time of 1988's <i>Idlewild</i>. This is the album where, sadly, all of the band's poise and restraint often turns to blandness. At its weakest, it's as if the laid-back reveries of <i>Eden </i>had been given a personality-erasing clean-up, tender bits of indie small-town portraiture being power-washed with late-80s gloss. The album's uniformity means EBTG never embarrass themselves, but the production gives the even the most intimate songs slickness that verges on sterility. A shame, too, because the songs are some of the strongest EBTG had written thus far, pointing not so much to their later and more well-known work as the wise and reflective solo albums Thorn has made in the last decade. ""Oxford Street"", in particular, is a heartbreaking little private meditation on the passage of time and its effects on both the world and how one person perceives it. On the bonus cuts, the band indulges its intermittent country music jones, Thorn stretches out on more expansive tunes like the cover of Crazy Horse's ""I Don't Want to Talk About It"", and the home demos prove that recording outside of a studio in no way means a more handmade-sounding product.</p>
<p>These reissues sound great, especially on <i>Eden</i>, where the soft parts feel fuller and the edges more defined, without getting too sharp and digitally prickly. The other albums were often too sharp and digitally prickly to begin with, but they definitely seem brighter, which only fits the vibe. These albums are always fascinating from a historical perspective, as evidence to the curious ways pop aspirations affected indie bands in the 80s. They're also often quite strong on their own merits. And even their missteps charm when you consider that Watt and Thorn rode out the rocky times, believed in each other, found success, and built a partnership (musical and otherwise) that's outlasted and often outshined acts who made bold statements and arresting debuts, only to fizzle in pop's glare.</p></div>"|16759.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16759-reissues/|7.0|Jess Harvell

In the process they try on styles, old and new alike, to see which fit best. They make wild stylistic leaps from album to album with only <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5173-tracey-thorn/"" target=""_blank"">Tracey Thorn</a>'s warm and wounded and utterly unflappable voice to provide a link between them. Do all of those change-ups work? Of course not. It'd be surprising if every move the young EBTG made <i>did </i>work. The road to the mature (and often very different) music that made EBTG global stars in the 1990s was unsurprisingly filled with the expected false-starts and dead-ends.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's equally surprising how assured and sophisticated much of this music remains, along with being intermittently moving and sometimes just undeniably catchy, albeit in a very dated way. This was a duo with a history in the earliest days of ramshackle UK indie pop, the moment just after post-punk that prided itself on peppy primitivism and emotional vulnerability. But from EBTG's debut album, 1984's <i>Eden</i>, it was clear that a creative life built around cutesy C86 sloppiness didn't much interest Thorn or partner Ben Watt. This is indie pop after it's been sent to finishing school, and the album plays out as one bittersweet swoon.</p>
<p>There's plenty of breezy Brit guitar jangle on <i>Eden</i>, but even that's played as smooth as possible. Thorn's smoky, stately singing transformed what might have been twee and childlike songs into something weirdly world-weary and cosmopolitan. Watt proves himself an adept student of retro styles here, mostly by avoiding the hubris of imagining himself as a big-band leader, using jazz horns and politely shuffling Latin rhythms as unexpected bursts of color. The only time he really flubs is on ""Crabwalk"", a tight-assed reverential jazz instrumental that less recalls the cinematic cool of Gil Evans than soundtrack filler in a kitchen-sink melodrama. The bonus tracks are fittingly all of a piece with the rest of the album, but special shout to the proto-dream pop, complete with angelic multi-tracked backing murmurs, of ""Easy as Sin"".</p>
<p>The world EBTG created on <i>Eden</i> was so <i>pleasant</i>, even at its glummest, that you wanted to linger there a while. 1985's <i>Love Not</i> <i>Money</i>, however,<i> </i>was a near-total reinvention and a complete stylistic mish-mash. One on hand, guitars came coated with about nine pounds of agreeably dated glitz, like the gaudily anthemic college rock being peddled by bands like the Icicle Works. On the other hand, it's the most soporific and studiously ""serious"" album EBTG ever made, and parts of it are a real drag. The murky, cavernous stuff assumes that droning on depressively is the best way to handle weighty topics, and some of the new touches, like the Celtic kitsch of ""Sean"", with ultra-kitschy tin flute, are so ham-fisted you'll cringe.</p>
<p>Yet EBTG's blunt if heartfelt seriousness really could be affecting when married to the kind of blissful tunes they did so well. At its infrequent best, <i>Love Not Money </i>plays the dreaminess of 80s soft-focus indie against the stark Reagan/Thatcher reality that so much 80s pop was rushing to avoid. And there are hints throughout that they could have pulled off the dark stuff, too. Built around Thorn's show-stopping, soulful, slow-burn of a performance, ""This Love (Not For Sale)"" is as epic a torch song as EBTG would write until the 90s, where 80s quiet-storm signifiers (that saxophone) meet an almost <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25136-talk-talk/"" target=""_blank"">Talk Talk</a> level of attention to sonic detail. The bonus tracks are an equally mixed bag, ranging from a stripped-back piano backing track for another excellent Thorn showcase, ""Charmless Callous Ways"", to ""Easy as Sin"", another attempt at a radio-friendly indie anthem that never quite achieves lift-off.</p>
<p>By 1986, many of EBTG's old post-punk contemporaries had scored big by embracing 80s pop radio's monumental mix of canned funk and total schmaltz. At the same time, ""adult contemporary"" values of classiness, composure, and old-school glamor had taken over pop as a whole. The same year's <i>Baby, the Stars Shine Bright</i> was the EBTG that felt like it had completely divested itself of any remaining trappings of rock, punk or otherwise. Along with having the biggest hooks they'd come up with yet, <i>Baby </i>is also the best of these four albums because they really commit themselves to its faintly cheesy opulence, sweeping <a href=""http://www.nelsonriddlemusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nelson Riddle</a> strings, and perfectly manicured horn charts.</p>
<p>After all, you can't sell a song with a title like ""Don't Let the Teardrops Rust Your Shining Heart"" by half-measures, and the music is as lush anything from the big-money era in which it was recorded, even if the lyrics betray a deep suspicion of the triumphal conservatism and creeping fascism that was the flipside to so much of the decade. Heard with 21st-century ears, what it most reminds me of is a <i>very</i> 1980s version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1931-matthew-herbert/"" target=""_blank"">Matthew Herbert</a>'s forays into big-band jazz and film scores, right down to the mix of old-school sonics and current tech, love songs and political commentary. Aside from a few supper-club snoozers, <i>Baby </i>is full of great and almost-forgotten 80s pop gems like ""Don't Leave Me Behind"", every ultra-bright piece of which sounds unashamedly stuck in its moment and all the better for it. The bonus tracks tend to stick to supper-club mode, though there's an even more momentous extended mix of album opener ""Come on Home"", and a few curious home-recorded demos that suggest what a lo-fi take on 80s big-biz pop might have sounded like.</p>
<p>All that excess and drama was gone by the time of 1988's <i>Idlewild</i>. This is the album where, sadly, all of the band's poise and restraint often turns to blandness. At its weakest, it's as if the laid-back reveries of <i>Eden </i>had been given a personality-erasing clean-up, tender bits of indie small-town portraiture being power-washed with late-80s gloss. The album's uniformity means EBTG never embarrass themselves, but the production gives the even the most intimate songs slickness that verges on sterility. A shame, too, because the songs are some of the strongest EBTG had written thus far, pointing not so much to their later and more well-known work as the wise and reflective solo albums Thorn has made in the last decade. ""Oxford Street"", in particular, is a heartbreaking little private meditation on the passage of time and its effects on both the world and how one person perceives it. On the bonus cuts, the band indulges its intermittent country music jones, Thorn stretches out on more expansive tunes like the cover of Crazy Horse's ""I Don't Want to Talk About It"", and the home demos prove that recording outside of a studio in no way means a more handmade-sounding product.</p>
<p>These reissues sound great, especially on <i>Eden</i>, where the soft parts feel fuller and the edges more defined, without getting too sharp and digitally prickly. The other albums were often too sharp and digitally prickly to begin with, but they definitely seem brighter, which only fits the vibe. These albums are always fascinating from a historical perspective, as evidence to the curious ways pop aspirations affected indie bands in the 80s. They're also often quite strong on their own merits. And even their missteps charm when you consider that Watt and Thorn rode out the rocky times, believed in each other, found success, and built a partnership (musical and otherwise) that's outlasted and often outshined acts who made bold statements and arresting debuts, only to fizzle in pop's glare.</p></div>"|16759.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16759-reissues/|6.4|Jess Harvell

They played the hallway of a bar, drank heavily, were half-naked, and played a bunch of two-minute songs where the titles basically said it all (""Can't Deal With Being Real"", ""Drugs on the Moon"", ""I Can't Skate""). It was an all-power, no-stakes snot-rock show, and it was awesome. So it came as a surprise to learn that the same shirtless, spazzy group of dudes have an album on <a href=""http://underwaterpeoples.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Underwater Peoples</a>, the label behind some elegant jangle-pop releases by Real Estate, Twerps, Julian Lynch, Ducktails, and more. But the album isn't a White Fang album, per se-- members of that band made it under the name <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Memories/321633651184829"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Memories</a>.</p>
<p>So let's get into the semantic differences between the Memories and White Fang. The live bands share members, but on their self-titled album, it's just frontman Erik Gage and guitarist Kyle Handley. Both mostly make songs that clock in under two minutes. In terms of subject matter, both bands have plenty of material about girls and getting high. The biggest difference, then, comes from each band's approach. White Fang have great rock'n'roll songs, but they aren't what you'd call ""subtle"" or ""quiet."" The Memories are the other side of that coin: They jangle; they infuse their songs with ebullient moments of atmosphere; and they deliver some straightforward, honest-to-god ballads.</p>
<p>Now granted, the lead-in ballad may be titled ""Baby (You're Totally Crazy)"", but ridiculous name aside, it's entirely beautiful. For just over a minute, Gage's vocals are tempered to a coo, singing a demure verse over a fingerpicked melody. And throughout <i>Memories</i>, there are quiet, mellow moments led by a no-frills guitar hook. It also helps that the band trims all the fat-- the LP features only the necessary verses and instrumentals, and there's not much in the way of bridges or repetition.<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13420-softly/"" target=""_blank""> ""Softly""</a> sounds like it could've gone on for at least two more verses, but fades out before we get the chance to hear them (and the song is stronger for it). The shortest song here is one minute and four seconds, and the entire album clocks in at 19 minutes. And although that means it's over pretty soon after it began, the band hits all the sweet spots without an extra second of unnecessary or indulgent songwriting.</p>
<p>The biggest thing potentially to work against the band is its lyrics. Lines like ""when she's takin' off my pants, I know what to do"" (from ""I Know What to Do""-- like White Fang, the Memories have pretty direct titles) will probably get some kneejerk negative reactions. But again, it helps that every song is counterbalanced by an unassuming, simple chord progression. There are definitely moments that smack of the early-1990s slacker songwriter aesthetic, as on ""Clueless"", where the central character has stolen money, smokes a bunch of weed, and doesn't know what to do with his life. But within the universe of <i>Memories</i>, that song's aesthetic totally works.</p>
<p>It'd be easy to look at <i>The Memories</i> as a cheap attempt by White Fang to masquerade as a chill Underwater Peoples band. But that's not the case at all-- the album isn't unrealistic in its scope. In length, it's comparable to White Fang's records. The subject matter is material that they've visited before. And like their White Fang records, it's a collection of songs with solid hooks at the core. The album is a testament to Gage and Handley's sonic flexibility, and even though they clock out after 19 minutes, they make sure each minute hits.</p></div>"|16880.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16880-the-memories/|7.4|Evan Minsker

In fact, he's a total dick most of the time. ""I don't want to believe or be in love,"" was George Lewis Jr.'s climactic mission statement on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11967-slow/"" target=""_blank"">""Slow""</a>, and the rest of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14675-forget/"" target=""_blank""><i>Forget</i></a> negated its new romantic sounds with accounts of people who chose to ignore his warning. There was the girl who promised to ""never let another black boy break [her] heart"" and became the subject of ""Tyrant Destroyed"", and then there was the partner in crime on ""Shooting Holes"", who took her father's gun and was sworn into secrecy. And as a message to the fellas, there was <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11984-i-cant-wait/"" target=""_blank"">""I Can't Wait""</a>, where Lewis stole your girl from right under your armpit because she hated your moves, the implication being that she was going to love his. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This persona played a huge role in distinguishing <i>Forget,</i> despite much evidence of it being wholly of Brooklyn, ca. 2010: <i>Pretty in Pink </i>sonic nostalgia, a cosign from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1843-grizzly-bear/"" target=""_blank"">Grizzly Bear</a>, smeared cover art. But in light of brash interviews and surprisingly torrid live shows, Lewis' careerist ambition, pretty boy swagger, and leering libido made clear he was not long for the world of back-patting, hand-holding indie rock. You might find the bad-boy posturing on <i>Confess</i>' cover too blatant in announcing Lewis' arrival as a self-identifying pop idol, but he refuses to apologize for anything here: not his brash lyrics, laser-focused songwriting, or glossy production. It's a purposefully arrogant star turn that would otherwise be insufferable if <i>Confess </i>didn't make it abundantly clear that Lewis is one of the few guys out there capable of living up to it.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">He's adjusting his role models to fit the situation, staying within the 80s but moving from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19331-psychedelic-furs/"" target=""_blank"">the Psychedelic Furs</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4072-simple-minds/"" target=""_blank"">Simple Minds</a>. Instead, he's taking <i>Purple Rain, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7728-born-to-run-30th-anniversary-edition/"" target=""_blank"">Born in the U.S.A. </a></i>and <i>Lost Boys </i>as guides. We're talking leather jackets, sullen glowers, salvation through hit-making. And <i>Confess </i>aspires to the excess of the Reagan years, when all genres were competing for the same MTV slots and the production on pop, rock, and R&amp;B records was essentially the same. But while <i>Confess </i>is slick, it doesn't sound slavishly retro or expensive; in fact, there's a eerie, disembodied artificiality to many of these sounds. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Lewis' rangy vocals rightfully remain at the forefront-- sultry and vulnerable in their lower reaches, with a clarion burst in its higher notes that recalls both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1670-peter-gabriel/"" target=""_blank"">Peter Gabriel</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4313-tv-on-the-radio/"" target=""_blank"">TV on the Radio</a>'s Tunde Adebimpe. But nearly every other sound is so crisp and airless that they become compellingly dehumanized. The snares during the disparaging chorus of ""Golden Light"" hit like open-hand slaps or a glass of cold water to the face, and harsh digital clipping on the kick drums and vocals express the claustrophobic lust of ""You Call Me On"". ""I Don't Care"" underlines the startling cruelty of its lyrics with a coda of grunts. ""The One"" is a rare moment of devotion communicated with blinding acoustic glare, while the exaggerated courtship of ""Beg For the Night"" accents its chorus with the utmost of new-money sounds, the orchestra hit. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">On a purely sonic level, <i>Confess </i>will tell you ""greed is good,"" and it's underlined by the economy of the songwriting, which shows a clear progression from the occasionally stunning but unbalanced <i>Forget.</i> The 10 songs on <i>Confess </i>operate only in power moves, the verses sneering, seducing, doing whatever they can to draw the listener in before every choruses ascends and explodes. Having recorded nearly all of <i>Confess </i>by himself, you hear a perfectionist's internal competition in Lewis, each song subject to merciless editing to assure that if he realizes the death wish alluded to in the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46897-watch-the-video-for-twin-shadows-five-seconds/"" target=""_blank"">""Five Seconds"" video</a>, he'll leave a beautiful corpse and a record of 10 fail-proof singles. It's textbook, time-honored stuff, but it's rarely done at this level. Whether it's the lush power-balladry of ""Beg For the Night"" and ""Be Mine Tonight"" or throttle-pushing rockers like ""You Call Me On"", <i>Confess </i>is defined by its melodic and emotional immediacy. This is no where more evident than it is on the cyclical refrain of the all-hook single ""Five Seconds""-- ""straight to the heart.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The ruthless efficiency extends to the lyrics, and this is what ultimately gives <i>Confess </i>its edge, pushing it into something more illicitly alluring. It's indeed a hyper-masculine record, almost every single lyric occurring at a relationship flashpoint between Lewis and a royal female ""you"" whose lust only confirms her misunderstanding of him. Combined with his refusal to sugarcoat anything, the first instinct is to assume it's a misogynist record as well, but <i>Confess </i>isn't macho or ""bro."" The songs are about dishonesty and what is revealed in desiring love but acting out of lust. The arrangement of ""Golden Light"" takes its cues from the secular uplift of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/221-arcade-fire/"" target=""_blank"">Arcade Fire</a> while flipping the carnal chorus of ""Atomic Dog"" into something simultaneously metaphysical and cynical-- ""Some people say you're the golden light/ And if I chase after you, doesn't mean it's true."" It's all to easy to hear a lyric like ""I don't give a damn about your dreams/ A whole world that is falling at the seams"" from ""You Call Me On"" as pitiless. But there's an equanimity to Lewis' viewpoint as he offers ""that's what it's supposed to do"" as a stark epigram of cold comfort. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">And he gets as good as he gives, rarely painting himself as a savior or even someone worthy of envy. ""Patient"" describes a no-strings fling that you'd think would be the optimum scenario in a Twin Shadow song, but the refusal to define it as such is torture for Lewis and you can hear it in <i>Confess</i>' most over the top arrangement, a bridge cobbling together drumline snares, a shredding guitar, and a push of his 80s influences somewhere towards New Jack Swing. Twin Shadow gets into darker metal-R&amp;B territory on ""I Don't Care"" whose superficially shocking admonishments to a morally suspect woman brings it awfully close to ""Dirty Diana"" territory. But ""I Don't Care"", like most of <i>Confess</i>, doesn't sound ego-fueled or even hateful. Lovers on <i>Confess </i>are equal co-conspirators, liars, fully complicit and bent on mutually assured destruction. Records from the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29533-the-weeknd/"" target=""_blank"">the Weeknd</a> have been instructive on how to toast to groin-led douchebags. But there's little hedonism or depravity here. On <i>Confess</i>,<i> </i>sex is dispassionately viewed like any addictive substance, one that basically destroys people who use it to fill a spiritual void.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This corrosive thread running throughout <i>Confess </i>helps illustrate the difference in intent between Twin Shadow's two simply titled albums. <i>Forget </i>hinted at traumatic experiences that Lewis was trying to process years after the fact and figured he'd be better off ignoring, whereas <i>Confess </i>doesn't actually cop to much-- just the challenge to ""say just what you mean and give up everything."" So then it's curious that during one of the softer moments of <i>Confess</i>, Lewis admits, ""I'll cry when the movie's over."" He's the cocky, successful, brutally honest lothario who almost always gets his comeuppance in cinema and is verboten in indie rock. But this is pop music where the bad guy wins. </p></div>"|16805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16805-confess/|8.6|Ian Cohen

Based on iTunes play count, <i>Lullaby</i> was the thing I listened to most last year, 48 freewheeling minutes of global bass and pop that reinforced the idea that genre doesn't matter as long as it bangs. Angolan club beats strung together with Brandy and Monica? Why not? Other artists, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1233-dj-rupture/"" target=""_blank"">DJ /rupture</a>, have been making this case for a while now, but part of what made <i>Lullaby</i> so appealing was how easy the entrance point was-- you didn't need any particular background to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Nguzunguzu (Asma Maroof and Daniel Pineda) have followed up <i>Lullaby</i> with original productions, first doing the Night Slugs-affiliated <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15660-timesup-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Timesup EP</i></a> and now <i>Warm Pulse</i> on the trendy L.A. imprint Hippos in Tanks. In both of these releases you can hear a slightly diminished sense of impact between their DJ material and their own tracks. This makes sense in a way because they're DJs first. ""I don't ever want to be called a band,"" Maroof <a href=""http://www.xlr8r.com/features/2012/06/five-minutes-s-nar-nguzunguzu"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said in an interview</a> recently, talking about how in a live setting they'd rather spin than recreate their original tunes. So on <i>Warm Pulse</i>, it feels like Nguzunguzu are stepping outside their comfort zone, learning in real time how apply a curatorial ear to the (very different) process of building music from the ground up.</p>
<p>Most of the time, they do a pretty good job. While <i>Timesup</i> extended some of the modern R&amp;B-via-global sound concepts of <i>Lullaby</i>, <i>Warm Pulse</i> is quite a bit different in style and tone. The title is a misnomer, really, since it's pretty easily the darkest and most ominous-sounding thing they've done so far. Rather than bright splashes of color, Nguzungzu focus here on a steely blue-and-gray palette, tracks where big walls of bass clang up against metal synths, creating kind of an industrial, construction-zone sound. ""Drop Cage"" is a good example, a blocky cut with jerking, stop-and-start bass decorated with mutant air horns diving in and out of frame. My colleague Zach Kelly called this ""futuristic ice-cream truck music"" and that's pretty much dead-on accurate.</p>
<p>This stuttering approach has a strange movement to it, like watching a drunk guy stumble down the street, tripping, steadying himself, and then tripping again. It's appealing for the majority of the EP but can also feel a bit cold and mechanical-- the grinding quality takes its toll and there aren't many vocal samples to punch things up. You start to miss those gaudy, expressive touches that made <i>Lullaby</i> so endlessly replayable. I think that's okay, though, because Nguzunguzu don't seem like a group that's going to run out of ideas anytime soon. Make a short list of the most promising young bass acts going, and they deserve to be on there-- a pair of DJs unbeholden to genre, who, even during their growing pains still manage to sound like the future.</p></div>"|16803.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16803-warm-pulse-ep/|6.8|Joe Colly

It is almost always ""sunny,"" frequently ""bouncy,"" occasionally ""sparkling,"" and composed of ""shimmering"" guitars and ""warm"" vocals. It is ""fun,"" ""upbeat,"" and ""catchy."" It might also be ""melancholic,"" but with a kind of sweetness to it, like a high-school fling that's suddenly imbued with some great meaning once you hit 30. Above all, it is perceived meteorologically as much as sonically; if you happen to be among the millions of landlocked shlubs in the middle of the country, beach music is romantic escapism that's been highly seductive since at least the early 1960s. But what if you already live in a sun-drenched paradise dotted by beach balls and bonfires? Where do you escape to then? All that's left for you is a deep, dark ocean, where relentless tides stalk lonely stragglers and threaten to swallow them whole into bottomless depths.  </p>

Over several albums, including his new effort, <i><a href=""http://jeanswilder.bandcamp.com/releases"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Totally</a>, </i>and a smattering of 7"" releases, Caddick has specialized in bummer summer jams for beach bums, adopting many of the same sonic tricks that bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27968-beach-fossils/"" target=""_blank"">Beach Fossils</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29923-dive/"" target=""_blank"">DIIV</a> have used to create much prettier records-- angular surf-guitar guitar lines, reverb-heavy ""boy"" vocals, understated-to-the-point-of-flatness rhythms-- and soaking them in disaffected darkness. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Only the weather is sunny in Jeans Wilder songs; the stuff inside is twisted and shadowy, and weighed down by unfulfilled hopes and dreams. Any meaning that can be gleaned from Caddick's murmured lyrics is spoken directly by the song titles: ""Blue Dream"", ""Dog Years"", ""Evaporated"", ""Slow Burn"". Caddick has seen the promised land and found it populated by failed actors and dead-eyed hippies passed out in the dunes. He's like Neil Young in the song ""On the Beach"": He lives in a place of sun and sand, ""but those seagulls are still out of reach.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">Actually, referring to the individual tracks on <i>Totally </i>as ""songs"" doesn't seem quite right. To paraphrase a line about Terry Valentine, the deeply tanned and shiny-toothed face of L.A.'s pitch-black soul in Steven Soderbergh's <i>The Limey, </i>they aren't specific enough to be songs-- they're more like a vibe. The opening track, ""Blue Dream"", floats some elegant keyboard tinkling over a bed of spooky wave crashes and howling wind gusts; it's as if the sun has set on mankind, not just southern California. From there, the sense of post-apocalyptic dread only grows<i>. </i>""Maple Bars"" is a long, awkward amble with a sideways cowboy-song beat that evokes a barren spaghetti-western wasteland; ""Limeade"" is more wild-west stuff, nodding in the direction of Bakersfield honky-tonk, only with the swagger stripped out and replaced with post-punk clunking. Lest things get too down and out, a party threatens to break out on the frisky, syncopated ""Evaporated""-- the album's most danceable song by many miles-- but the focus is put squarely on the socially anxious guitar chords strummed slowly and softly at a safe distance from the groove.</p>
<p class=""p1"">When Caddick manages to hit upon a solid melody or two, he can't be content with presenting beauty at face value. ""Dog Years"" could've potentially been his ""Surfer Girl"" moment, but he pours salt water on the melody and turns it into a coughing cacophony of fucked-up feeling. It's an effective evocation of a mood that Caddick is obsessed with conjuring throughout <i>Totally</i>, though this self-defeatism also results in a record that comes up short in overall form and substance. Caddick has shown us the seamy underbelly of beach culture; now he has to find a way to make it as alluring as the fantasy on the flipside. </p></div>"|16889.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16889-totally/|6.3|Steven Hyden

""The Jungle"" sounds like its name, a dense collage of deep house bass, eerie keyboards, rippling percussion, and an otherworldly flute solo, abandoning house's imperatives to jack, to cruise, or to score in favor of spacing out and dreaming.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""The Jungle"", together with the work of fellow dreamer Larry Heard (Mr. Fingers), cast the spell that <i>This Ain't Chicago: The Underground Sound of UK House and Acid 1987-1991 </i>explores. During the timeframe covered by this 2xCD set, the U.S. continued to advance the borders of house's music interplanetary eccentricity (most notably on releases by New York's Nu Groove Records). But <i>This Ain't Chicago </i>makes the case that UK producers and audiences not only embraced this otherworldly vision of house, they thought this was what house <i>was</i>. Arguably, this creative misinterpretation of the style's operating principles reflected chemical rather than stylistic concerns, with the influence of ecstasy on UK dancefloors de-prioritizing sex and elevating blissed-out self-exploration. It's a story you've probably heard before, but the UK's distorted reception of U.S. dance music is better remembered for what it ultimately led to (""Madchester"" indie, rave, IDM, and so on) than for the initial impact of producers trying to create their own version of the Chicago sound, the traces of which are confined to a sprinkling of chart successes and an equally limited handful of tunes now engrained in dance music's canon.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Lovingly compiled by Padded Cell's Richard Sen, <i>This Ain't Chicago</i> passes over these obvious choices-- A Guy Called Gerald's ""Voodoo Ray""<i> </i>or 808 State's ""Pacific State"", say-- in favor of a clutch of tunes largely forgotten by history. It's a welcome move, given that the inclusions are so frequently excellent. Bang the Party's ""Bang Bang You're Mine"" (1990), all floating snares, drifting bongo patterns, and enervated soul falsetto, sounds as much like the contemporaneous dream-pop of A.R. Kane as it does Adonis; more so, in fact, than A.R. Kane's own attempts at house music. Meanwhile, the deep house of Julian Jonah's ""Jealousy and Lies"" (1988) builds on the blueprint of Mr. Fingers' ""Mystery of Love"", offering a calmly delivered relationship psychodrama over scintillating snare patterns and abstracted reversed synth washes. Even if these tracks don't better their Chicago forefathers, it's almost inexplicable that they've been denied the retrospective treatment until now.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Inevitably, at times <i>This Ain't Chicago </i>shades into new sounds emerging from the fertile melting plot of club and rave sounds during the collection's utterly transformative five-year time frame, most remarkably on Ability II's ""Pressure Dub"" (1991), nominally a bleep techno tune, but in truth an astonishingly prescient 10-minute dub-house soundworld of refracting echoes. There are also, as the compilation's subtitle suggests, several tunes that cop the burbling ""acid"" 303 synthesizer bassline from made famous by Phuture's Chicago house classic ""Acid Tracks"". Appropriately stripped down and ominous, but lacking some of the ostentatious flair that distinguished 808 State's late-80s acid house efforts, these mostly comprise the set's less interesting moments. </p>
<p class=""p1"">It's this sense of fearless overreach that unites <i>This Ain't Chicago</i>'s best moments, with producers capitalizing on house's additive structure by piling on every trick they can think of to create top-heavy epics of bristling sonics and contradictory moods. By the early 90s, house (in the UK and U.S. alike) was cleaning up and smoothing out in contrast to rave, understanding better, perhaps too well, the appeal of the endless groove at its heart. But in music, getting it wrong can be as productive as getting it right, and at their best, <i>This Ain't Chicago</i>'s mistakes remain thrilling.</p></div>"|16809.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16809-this-aint-chicago-the-underground-sound-of-uk-house-and-acid-1987-1991/|7.7|Tim Finney

<p>Listeners who've paid attention to trends in electronic music of the past 12 months or so won't be at all surprised by what they hear on <i>Whispers in the Dark</i>: new age textures, plenty of clipped and distressed vocals, lush R&amp;B notes, rhythms that nod to Southern hip-hop. So while Supreme Cuts' hometown seems to be a big part of the duo's influence, <i>Whispers in the Dark</i>'s real home is the expanding digital realm.</p>
<p>While there isn't much to set them apart from their peers, Perry and Kjeultes do have a strong sense of craft. Building on warm rushes of synth, there are slight detours into <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27856-the-dream/"" target=""_blank"">Dream</a>-like slow-rock R&amp;B (""18th""), factory-issued two-step (single ""Sherm""), post-witch house moves (""e2"") and watery, stretches of electro-zen a la <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28640-balam-acab/"" target=""_blank"">Balam Acab</a> (""Ciroc Waterfalls"", an argument for a moratorium on dripping sound effects). Most of the tracks on <i>Whispers in the Dark</i> <i></i>could <i>almost</i> be repurposed as cloud-rap productions. Had the two waited things out a bit longer, who's to say that zonked MCs wouldn't be flocking to Supreme Cuts the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30154-squadda-b/"" target=""_blank"">Squadda B</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"" target=""_blank"">the Based God</a> himself have flocked to the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29547-clams-casino/"" target=""_blank"">Clams Casino</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29688-spaceghostpurrp/"" target=""_blank"">Spaceghostpurrp</a>? So it makes sense that the duo now has a rap mixtape coming down the pipeline.</p>
<p>To get to that point, though, they'll need to keep their focus. One of <i>Whispers in the Dark</i>'s biggest problems is how these little assemblages are structured. Perry and Kjeultes seem too anxious to switch things up and move onto the next idea before letting the previous one properly germinate. When things threaten to get funky or propulsive, they crawl back into the comfort of the inertia-deprived cosmos. Without building suspense or tension, these breaks feel pallid and underwhelming and begin to smear together.</p>
<p>The record's second half is stronger than the first, more movement-minded and at times irreverent. Highlight ""Belly"" uses overdone vocal samples to the best of its ability, with a bassier clip playing nicely off a feminine android voice, creating some needed hookiness Though often disjointed, when some of these fragments manage to really connect, it's hard not to imagine Supreme Cuts as being able to hit a decent stride in the future.</p></div>"|16813.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16813-whispers-in-the-dark/|5.9|Zach Kelly

And then she sings the following verse. ""See me in your city, looking pretty, yeah I'm shining dog/ With my fresh Air Ones and my dog/ G is black and white, fuck segregation."" The sound and lyrics (cribbed from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5lIWti4VUw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">T.I.</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7tOAGY59uQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lil Wayne</a> anthems) have nothing to do with one another. The contrast is so jarring it's almost laughable. And right here in 30 seconds or so of music, you feel the paradox of this band-- their ability to make lovely, stirring pop that occasionally falls flat on its face.</p>
<p>It's odd because jj have already proven that they can do this sort of thing well. Their music has always been about pastiche and has always incorporated hip-hop to some degree. It's resulted in great songs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11369-ecstasy/"" target=""_blank"">""Ecstasy"" </a>that transformed Lil Wayne's ""Lollipop"" into a gurgling Balearic burner without feeling like a winking cover. But even though they clearly love hip-hop, there is a fine line in what jj do, where appropriation can suddenly turn into parody, and <i>High Summer</i> struggles to find the right balance. There are moments where their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/resonant-frequency/8713-this-is-me-music-making-as-re-blog/"" target=""_blank"">Tumblr-ized</a> mix of lovelorn indie pop, bouncy Mediterranean club beats, and rap attitude unfurls in a cohesive image stream and there are moments when it does not.</p>
<p>The thing jj have had going for them since the start is a solid sense of craft. Their talent for melody was what made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13326-jj-n-2/"" target=""_blank""><i>jj n°2</i></a> sparkle and its absence made the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14045-jj-n-3/"" target=""_blank"">follow-up</a> drift along aimlessly. When they tap back into that, like they do on ""Big Hearts, Big Dreams"", it's easy to feel some of that old jj magic. A wispy 80s-radio synth backdrop connects with modern slabs of bass and computerized drum claps and it all just takes off and goes skyward. Instead of cut-and-pasting her favorite Weezy bars, Kastlander mixes her own love-and-loss experiences with rap boasts like, ""Get high off this weed, then we fly over beats,"" in a way that blurs reality but still leaves a piece of her in it.</p>
<p>This is when I think jj are at their best, an introverted pair of friends making escape music. They build a tender track like ""10"" from the beat of The-Dream's ""Shawty Is da Shit!"" because they love that song and technology allows them to easily do it. They wrap it up in gentle emo-isms (""Did you forget me?"") and add in sounds of birds chirping because maybe that's what their dreams sound like. It's a fantasy and you're invited. The problem with dreams, everyone knows, is they vanish as quickly as they come. All of a sudden you’re snapped back to a reality where a Swedish woman sings, ""Not only am I fly, I'm fuckin' not playing,"" and it kind of makes you cringe.</p></div>"|16898.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16898-high-summer-ep/|6.5|Joe Colly

That's okay, you weren't supposed to. At the time of their release (the late 1960s and early 1970s), Parks was part of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/underscore/8786-nilsson-newman-and-some-other-la-weirdos/"">a crowd of mercurial genius weirdos</a> wandering record-label halls; of this group, Parks could easily have been voted Least Likely to Succeed. (He probably would have volunteered himself for the honor.) The records he issued under his own name had a cheerful Mt. Olympus aura about them: They sat contentedly in rarefied air, budging for no one but graciously welcoming any travelers who hazarded the journey.</p>
<p>Over the ensuing decades, this is where they've remained: known vaguely by reputation, name-checked for erudition, never playing at parties. Every five years or so, some devotee does some of Parks's publicity work for him; Joanna Newsom hired him to orchestrate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9616-ys/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ys</i></a> and spoke with awe of listening repeatedly to Parks' <i>Song Cycle</i> while <i>Ys</i> fermented in her mind. But otherwise, Parks' solo records have always seemed destined to be known more for their influence, celebrated more for the big ideas they dislodged in the minds of others rather than for themselves.</p>
<p>Recently, however, Parks has begun attending to his own solo legacy. Last year, he put out the compilation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15840-van-dyke-parks-arrangements-vol-1/"" target=""_blank""><i>Arrangements, Vol. 1</i></a> on his own Bananastan label; it was a reintroduction of sorts, and a prudent place to begin. Immediately ingratiating and full of pop songs, <i>Arrangements</i> hinted at the knottiness of Parks' vision. Still, as a primer for <i>Song Cycle</i>, <i>Discover America</i>, and <i>Clang of the Yankee Reaper</i>, which Parks has now reissued, <i>Arrangements</i> is adequate only insofar as dipping your toes in a wading pool is preparation for leaping from a cliff into a raging sea.</p>
<p>1968's <i>Song Cycle</i> is the big one, the one with the capital-R Reputation. Perfumed, florid, over-crowded, the album is Parks' attempt to synthesize 100 years' worth of American music on borrowed studio time. The album cost a staggering amount and sold next to nothing; with this gesture, he cemented his artistic reputation and sank his career like a stone. Warner Bros. heralded <i>Song Cycle </i> with a <a href=""http://hongkietown.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/vandyke1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">panicky flop-sweat flourish disguised as a marketing campaign</a>.</p>
<p>The standard line on <i>Song Cycle </i> is that it's impenetrable, and it can be. But it depends what you're listening for. If you approach it expecting a tuneful singer-songwriter album, then you're going to be continually deposited on the top of your own head. If, however, you're looking to take a midnight stroll through a Civil War memorabilia museum, where every figurine and placard suddenly springs to life and begins singing, then you'll feel right at home.</p>
<p>Part of <i>Song Cycle</i>'s bum rap for seriousness is earned-- the name itself suggests something too weighty to consider itself a mere ""album."" But once you adjust to its mannerisms, <i>Song Cycle</i> is a freewheeling, often goofy listen, a down-the-rabbit-hole take on American music that reimagines bluegrass on a symphony-hall stage, showtunes up in Appalachia, and the sturm-und-drang rumblings of Romantic-era classical orchestras facing off against a squeezebox. Richard Henderson, in his 33 1/3 book on <i>Song Cycle</i>, called the album ""Charles Ives in Groucho Marx's pajamas,"" and it captures the antic spirit of an album whose working title, before <i>Song Cycle</i>, was ""Looney Tunes"".</p>
<p>Parks doesn't corral all of this mess so much as rattle around cheerfully inside it. You might get lost in a thicket at some point-- maybe when the orchestra dissolves into pedal-steel guitar, which dissolves into chirping birds on ""Palm Desert"". Or when ""Public Domain"" fades out for the fourth or fifth time, or when a wobbly 78 starts playing in the middle of ""By the People"". But no matter where you are, Parks is ambling just around the corner, like the Cheshire Cat, offering clues. The sixth song on the album is called ""Van Dyke Parks"": It is a recording of the gospel hymnal ""Nearer My God to Thee"", accompanied by the sound of rushing water. What could this possibly mean? Would it help to know that ""Nearer My God to Thee"" is traditionally assumed to be the last song played by the band on the deck of the Titanic? No?</p>
<p>This inscrutable bone-dry wit is as encoded into Parks' music as his evident love of beauty. His singing voice has a peculiar quality; high and sweet and chipper and fey and dripping with ill will, he plays the part of the wiseguy pipsqueak wandering around a grand manor, surveying the grand artifacts with skepticism. He built the place, but to hear him, you would think he not only had nothing to do with the construction but finds the whole display mildly distasteful. The lyrics of <i>Song Cycle</i> are full of starving artists and privation: ""Widows face the future/ Factories face the poor,"" he remarks jauntily on ""Widow's Walk"". Parks is merely a bohemian with an empty refrigerator; these songs are too nice for him. This tension-- a distrust of finer things, a respect of their power; an appreciation of their beauty, an understanding that the finer things are inherently ridiculous-- gives <i>Song Cycle</i> its melancholy depth, corroding its sheen like acid rain on a sculpture.</p>
<p>After <i>Song Cycle</i>, Parks disappeared back into his arranging work for four years. It wasn't until 1972 that he dared put out another record with his name on the sleeve. <i>Discover America</i> begins, as <i>Song Cycle</i> did, with a brief clip of someone else's music. On <i>Song Cycle</i>, it was Steve Young hollering the bluegrass staple ""Black Jack Davy"". On <i>Discover America</i>, it is the Trinidadian calypso artist Mighty Sparrow complaining merrily about the perseverance of aging prostitutes in a song called ""Jack Palance"". (As in ""she got a face like."") The song fades out, and a recorded voice blurts in, dryly, ""here are all of the natives of Parnassus, Pennsylvania."" Whatever Parks learned from the commercial fiasco that was <i>Song Cycle</i>, it wasn't to tone the weirdness down.</p>
<p>The presence of Mighty Sparrow isn't a red herring; <i>Discover America</i> is a Van Dyke Parks calypso record, suffused with wooden marimbas and the cheery ping of steel drums, and overlaid with at least two or three layers of distanced weirdness. Parks treats calypso with the same forensic fascination and trickster spirit he applied to <i>Song Cycle</i>; track four is called ""Steelband Music"", and Parks uses it as a ""Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra"" opportunity, asking us eagerly to pay attention to ""the prominent notes on the tenor pan."" ""The Four Mills Brothers"", a cover of a Depression-era standard, has more helpful, record-collector advice for us: ""The best crooner is Rudi Valli/ But for voice control visit Bing Crosby.""</p>
<p>For Parks, discovering America is inseparable from discovering its music. Even more than <i>Song Cycle</i>, <i>Discover America</i> is a vaudevillian stage, across which Parks parades a series of acts. ""Occapella"" and ""Riverboat"" are rumpled, mellow Allen Toussaint covers. ""Sailin' Shoes"", a song written by Little Feat's Lowell George, adopts a ripe, heavy-lidded sway to describe a woman doing a dance ""so rhythmically"" underneath ""a cocaine tree."" Parks seems about as unconcerned with the sordid leer of the lyrics here as he does the genteel misogyny of the father-son advice song ""Be Careful""; they are all just songs to him, and songs are blameless.</p>
<p>On his following record, 1975's <i>Clang of the Yankee Reaper</i>, the bit players and special guests claim the stage. The album contains only one original Van Dyke Parks composition-- the title track. The rest is a lovely and generously selected songbook record, ranging from the calypso of Mighty Sparrow's ""Pass That Stage"" and Sandpebbles' ""Another Dream"" to Irving Caesar's Tin Pan Alley tune ""You're a Real Sweetheart"". All lovely songs, with lovely performances, but otherwise, it is the least-essential of Parks' first three records. It emerged from his brain, which means it is warped, both structurally and psychologically, but on a scale of more Van Dyke Parks to less, in which <i>Song Cycle</i> is a steep 10 and <i>Discover</i> a more manageable seven, <i>Clang</i> is a mild six. The thrill is in the disorientation, in the genial free fall; <i>Clang</i> offers hardcore seekers of this particular thrill only a gentle breeze in the face.</p>
<p>To accompany these reissues, Van Dyke Parks recently performed a show at London's Barbican Theatre. He opened it with a wisecrack about his career, as if to squirt bug spray at anyone with the nerve to canonize him: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46970-report-van-dyke-parks-with-grizzly-bears-daniel-rossen-and-fleet-foxes-robin-pecknold-in-london/"">""We're here to celebrate anonymity-- what Faulkner called 'the authority of failure,'""</a> he cracked. He said something similar to me, in passing, when I spoke to him briefly a few years ago. The repetition leads me to believe it's something of a cocktail-napkin line for him, a droll quip he's cultivated for dinner parties that suggests a deeper worldview. It may be a defense mechanism, a way of handling an illustrious career overshadowed by rock stars. It may also be a curious kind of armor: Van Dyke Parks, the wag who spoke in tongues. I hope that with the reissuing of these seminal records, that Parks won't have reason to pretend to be anonymous and misunderstood for much longer.</p></div>"|16765.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16765-song-cycle-discover-america-clang-of-the-yankee-reaper/|9.0|Jayson Greene

Last year, he put out the compilation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15840-van-dyke-parks-arrangements-vol-1/"" target=""_blank""><i>Arrangements, Vol. 1</i></a> on his own Bananastan label; it was a reintroduction of sorts, and a prudent place to begin. Immediately ingratiating and full of pop songs, <i>Arrangements</i> hinted at the knottiness of Parks' vision. Still, as a primer for <i>Song Cycle</i>, <i>Discover America</i>, and <i>Clang of the Yankee Reaper</i>, which Parks has now reissued, <i>Arrangements</i> is adequate only insofar as dipping your toes in a wading pool is preparation for leaping from a cliff into a raging sea.</p>
<p>1968's <i>Song Cycle</i> is the big one, the one with the capital-R Reputation. Perfumed, florid, over-crowded, the album is Parks' attempt to synthesize 100 years' worth of American music on borrowed studio time. The album cost a staggering amount and sold next to nothing; with this gesture, he cemented his artistic reputation and sank his career like a stone. Warner Bros. heralded <i>Song Cycle </i> with a <a href=""http://hongkietown.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/vandyke1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">panicky flop-sweat flourish disguised as a marketing campaign</a>.</p>
<p>The standard line on <i>Song Cycle </i> is that it's impenetrable, and it can be. But it depends what you're listening for. If you approach it expecting a tuneful singer-songwriter album, then you're going to be continually deposited on the top of your own head. If, however, you're looking to take a midnight stroll through a Civil War memorabilia museum, where every figurine and placard suddenly springs to life and begins singing, then you'll feel right at home.</p>
<p>Part of <i>Song Cycle</i>'s bum rap for seriousness is earned-- the name itself suggests something too weighty to consider itself a mere ""album."" But once you adjust to its mannerisms, <i>Song Cycle</i> is a freewheeling, often goofy listen, a down-the-rabbit-hole take on American music that reimagines bluegrass on a symphony-hall stage, showtunes up in Appalachia, and the sturm-und-drang rumblings of Romantic-era classical orchestras facing off against a squeezebox. Richard Henderson, in his 33 1/3 book on <i>Song Cycle</i>, called the album ""Charles Ives in Groucho Marx's pajamas,"" and it captures the antic spirit of an album whose working title, before <i>Song Cycle</i>, was ""Looney Tunes"".</p>
<p>Parks doesn't corral all of this mess so much as rattle around cheerfully inside it. You might get lost in a thicket at some point-- maybe when the orchestra dissolves into pedal-steel guitar, which dissolves into chirping birds on ""Palm Desert"". Or when ""Public Domain"" fades out for the fourth or fifth time, or when a wobbly 78 starts playing in the middle of ""By the People"". But no matter where you are, Parks is ambling just around the corner, like the Cheshire Cat, offering clues. The sixth song on the album is called ""Van Dyke Parks"": It is a recording of the gospel hymnal ""Nearer My God to Thee"", accompanied by the sound of rushing water. What could this possibly mean? Would it help to know that ""Nearer My God to Thee"" is traditionally assumed to be the last song played by the band on the deck of the Titanic? No?</p>
<p>This inscrutable bone-dry wit is as encoded into Parks' music as his evident love of beauty. His singing voice has a peculiar quality; high and sweet and chipper and fey and dripping with ill will, he plays the part of the wiseguy pipsqueak wandering around a grand manor, surveying the grand artifacts with skepticism. He built the place, but to hear him, you would think he not only had nothing to do with the construction but finds the whole display mildly distasteful. The lyrics of <i>Song Cycle</i> are full of starving artists and privation: ""Widows face the future/ Factories face the poor,"" he remarks jauntily on ""Widow's Walk"". Parks is merely a bohemian with an empty refrigerator; these songs are too nice for him. This tension-- a distrust of finer things, a respect of their power; an appreciation of their beauty, an understanding that the finer things are inherently ridiculous-- gives <i>Song Cycle</i> its melancholy depth, corroding its sheen like acid rain on a sculpture.</p>
<p>After <i>Song Cycle</i>, Parks disappeared back into his arranging work for four years. It wasn't until 1972 that he dared put out another record with his name on the sleeve. <i>Discover America</i> begins, as <i>Song Cycle</i> did, with a brief clip of someone else's music. On <i>Song Cycle</i>, it was Steve Young hollering the bluegrass staple ""Black Jack Davy"". On <i>Discover America</i>, it is the Trinidadian calypso artist Mighty Sparrow complaining merrily about the perseverance of aging prostitutes in a song called ""Jack Palance"". (As in ""she got a face like."") The song fades out, and a recorded voice blurts in, dryly, ""here are all of the natives of Parnassus, Pennsylvania."" Whatever Parks learned from the commercial fiasco that was <i>Song Cycle</i>, it wasn't to tone the weirdness down.</p>
<p>The presence of Mighty Sparrow isn't a red herring; <i>Discover America</i> is a Van Dyke Parks calypso record, suffused with wooden marimbas and the cheery ping of steel drums, and overlaid with at least two or three layers of distanced weirdness. Parks treats calypso with the same forensic fascination and trickster spirit he applied to <i>Song Cycle</i>; track four is called ""Steelband Music"", and Parks uses it as a ""Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra"" opportunity, asking us eagerly to pay attention to ""the prominent notes on the tenor pan."" ""The Four Mills Brothers"", a cover of a Depression-era standard, has more helpful, record-collector advice for us: ""The best crooner is Rudi Valli/ But for voice control visit Bing Crosby.""</p>
<p>For Parks, discovering America is inseparable from discovering its music. Even more than <i>Song Cycle</i>, <i>Discover America</i> is a vaudevillian stage, across which Parks parades a series of acts. ""Occapella"" and ""Riverboat"" are rumpled, mellow Allen Toussaint covers. ""Sailin' Shoes"", a song written by Little Feat's Lowell George, adopts a ripe, heavy-lidded sway to describe a woman doing a dance ""so rhythmically"" underneath ""a cocaine tree."" Parks seems about as unconcerned with the sordid leer of the lyrics here as he does the genteel misogyny of the father-son advice song ""Be Careful""; they are all just songs to him, and songs are blameless.</p>
<p>On his following record, 1975's <i>Clang of the Yankee Reaper</i>, the bit players and special guests claim the stage. The album contains only one original Van Dyke Parks composition-- the title track. The rest is a lovely and generously selected songbook record, ranging from the calypso of Mighty Sparrow's ""Pass That Stage"" and Sandpebbles' ""Another Dream"" to Irving Caesar's Tin Pan Alley tune ""You're a Real Sweetheart"". All lovely songs, with lovely performances, but otherwise, it is the least-essential of Parks' first three records. It emerged from his brain, which means it is warped, both structurally and psychologically, but on a scale of more Van Dyke Parks to less, in which <i>Song Cycle</i> is a steep 10 and <i>Discover</i> a more manageable seven, <i>Clang</i> is a mild six. The thrill is in the disorientation, in the genial free fall; <i>Clang</i> offers hardcore seekers of this particular thrill only a gentle breeze in the face.</p>
<p>To accompany these reissues, Van Dyke Parks recently performed a show at London's Barbican Theatre. He opened it with a wisecrack about his career, as if to squirt bug spray at anyone with the nerve to canonize him: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46970-report-van-dyke-parks-with-grizzly-bears-daniel-rossen-and-fleet-foxes-robin-pecknold-in-london/"">""We're here to celebrate anonymity-- what Faulkner called 'the authority of failure,'""</a> he cracked. He said something similar to me, in passing, when I spoke to him briefly a few years ago. The repetition leads me to believe it's something of a cocktail-napkin line for him, a droll quip he's cultivated for dinner parties that suggests a deeper worldview. It may be a defense mechanism, a way of handling an illustrious career overshadowed by rock stars. It may also be a curious kind of armor: Van Dyke Parks, the wag who spoke in tongues. I hope that with the reissuing of these seminal records, that Parks won't have reason to pretend to be anonymous and misunderstood for much longer.</p></div>"|16765.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16765-song-cycle-discover-america-clang-of-the-yankee-reaper/|8.5|Jayson Greene

That's okay, you weren't supposed to. At the time of their release (the late 1960s and early 1970s), Parks was part of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/underscore/8786-nilsson-newman-and-some-other-la-weirdos/"">a crowd of mercurial genius weirdos</a> wandering record-label halls; of this group, Parks could easily have been voted Least Likely to Succeed. (He probably would have volunteered himself for the honor.) The records he issued under his own name had a cheerful Mt. Olympus aura about them: They sat contentedly in rarefied air, budging for no one but graciously welcoming any travelers who hazarded the journey.</p>
<p>Over the ensuing decades, this is where they've remained: known vaguely by reputation, name-checked for erudition, never playing at parties. Every five years or so, some devotee does some of Parks's publicity work for him; Joanna Newsom hired him to orchestrate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9616-ys/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ys</i></a> and spoke with awe of listening repeatedly to Parks' <i>Song Cycle</i> while <i>Ys</i> fermented in her mind.

This news report opens <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5720-foals/"" target=""_blank"">Foals</a>' entry in German label <a href=""http://www.k7.com/welcome.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">!K7</a>'s Tapes series, indicating some desolation at the demise of the rectangular plastic medium. It's too literal an introduction to the Oxford band's wide-reaching addition to the series (which was compiled by the band's keyboardist, Edwin Congreave), clunkily and inadvertently embracing the world of fey frippery from which you imagine Foals would rather distinguish themselves.</p>
<p>In the UK, indie nights are more commonly referred to as ""indie discos,"" that antiquated, mumsy terminology indicating the cozy safeness of a zone where you're never going to get frotted, daggered, subjected to a David Guetta track, or persuaded to take your clothes off and dance in a cage. Jerky, shrieky songs like Foals' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3lWbPEOJp0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cassius""</a> are staples on the dancefloors of these places, where hand-wringing and shuffling are the moves of choice. (I may sound disparaging; let it be known that I spent my university nights going to an indie disco on a boat, and that I've cried at a Foals gig more than once.) The misfire of including wan royalty <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29639-blood-orange/"" target=""_blank"">Blood Orange</a> here aside, there's little on Foals' <i>Tapes</i> to suggest that they'd ever set foot in such a bloodless establishment by choice.</p>
<p>Although the compilation's second half (it's supposed to be two sides of a tape) is theoretically the more muscular, South African artist Condry Ziqubu's ""Confusion (Ma Afrika)"" on side one marks the start of one of the mix's more invigorating arcs. The story goes that Foals singer Yannis Philippakis ripped the song-- cheap keyboards, socially conscious lyrics, and stirring choruses-- off a tape that his mum used to play in the 80s. Congreave pushes that sense of personality through the two subsequent songs, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27748-the-invisible/"" target=""_blank"">the Invisible</a>'s deliciously louche <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11175-london-girl/"" target=""_blank"">""London Girl""</a> (which appears to nick half the bass line from the Sugarhill Gang's ""Rapper's Delight""), and the Gatto Fritto remix of JR Seaton's ""Way Savvy"", a dizzying, silken scramble that grips the tails of bottle rockets and hangs on for dear life.</p>
<p>Further on, the dry funk of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/851-carl-craig/"" target=""_blank"">Carl Craig</a>'s remix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6152-tony-allen/"" target=""_blank"">Tony Allen</a>'s ""Kilode"" locks into Art Department's wry, writhing underground house hit, ""We Call Love"", with the burst of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24089-frankie-knuckles/"" target=""_blank"">Frankie Knuckles</a>' remix of Cerrone's ""Give Me Love"" proving the final corner of a distinctly old-school triumvirate. The overdriven burble of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2384-konono-n1/"" target=""_blank"">Konono Nº1</a>'s ""Paradiso"" leads the introverted Midland edit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/947-caribou/"" target=""_blank"">Caribou</a>'s ""Sun"" into an abjectly joyous place, Gospel Comforter's ""Yes God is Real"", where the arid funk guitar trembles beneath Major Haines' flooring voice.</p>
<p>If the rest of the mix doesn't always hit those peaks, at least it's eclectic. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29422-nicolas-jaar/"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Jaar</a>'s ""Variations"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/576-bibio/"" target=""_blank"">Bibio</a>'s remix of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4987-clark/"" target=""_blank"">Clark</a>'s ""Ted"" open the compilation in a pastoral, ruminative place, which wriggles and womps terrifically toward the end with the Maurice Donovan Dub of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29346-julio-bashmore/"" target=""_blank"">Julio Bashmore</a>'s ""Battle for Middle You"". Most of the top comments on these songs' YouTube entries are from presumably fairly young people posting, ""Thumbs up if Foals' <i>Tapes</i> sent you here!,"" which is never a disheartening thing to see. It's probably a leap too far to try and draw any conclusions about how Foals' third album will sound on account of this collection-- besides, it's too varied to be streamlined into a single influence-- but at least it transcends the nostalgic idea with which it starts, making the idea of the band taking these ideas and running with them a pleasingly feasible one.</p></div>"|16804.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16804-tapes/|6.5|Laura Snapes

<p><i>Rebirth of Detroit, </i><a href=""http://www.j-dilla.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">J Dilla</a>'s second posthumous album, is a grandiose reclamation, as Detroit wraps the venerated MC and production pioneer into an inescapable bear hug. He's made, once again, into the figurehead and totem for the once-great city. The album holds 21 tracks of classically raw Motor City rap, and all the good and bad that comes with that mythic Michigan territory. Unlike his first posthumous collection, 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13152-jay-stay-paid/"" target=""_blank""><i>Jay Stay Paid</i></a>, most of the tracks on <i>Rebirth</i> have rappers on them, a coterie of Detroit MC's who double as Dilla worshippers. This is occasionally a blessing, but too often subpar rhymes or poor chemistry between multiple rappers disguises what would otherwise be a solid beat.</p>
<p>This fervent Motown loyalty means that the beats on the album are vintage, Slum Village-era production, a sound that may have come to define Dilla if swan song <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4365-donuts/"" target=""_blank""><i>Donuts</i></a> hadn't added another facet to his legacy. They're pure Detroit tracks and, as such, serve as a more conservative collection than those featured on <i>Jay Stay Paid. </i>For the most part, these are pointed hi-fi beats with bass slaps and sharp snares, samples whittled to a point and deployed with casual precision. This quality, a kind of nonchalant strictness, is a gift of Dilla's-- he has the same kind of genius for making things look easy, as do the greatest athletes. Listen to the way that loop kaleidoscopes on ""My Victory"" or the rainbow synths and slightly flattened bass on ""Ride With It"". Check the vintage menace of the Jaylib sound on ""Say My Name"", ""City of Boom"", or ""Do It Right"". Every beat here is perfectly calibrated, reflecting an impressive, inborn discipline, one that Dilla would eventually leave behind in favor of a looser, messier sound.</p>
<p>One of the great things about Dilla's group Slum Village was the way that T3 and Baatin rapped quietly, with plenty of negative space available to give Jay Dee's beats the spotlight they deserved. It makes for a good litmus test to check how true the MC's on <i>Rebirth</i> are to that formula. Sometimes on an individual song, one rapper will stay chilled out, while another will rap his verses completely oblivious to the dynamic-- as on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46814-check-out-two-unreleased-j-dilla-tracks/"" target=""_blank"">""Detroit Game""</a>, where Cool Kid Chuck Inglish exercises restraint to great effect, only to find the second verse ruined by one Boldy James, who raps rigidly, refusing to let the track breathe.   </p>
<p>Then too, there's the problem of Dilla dogma. For the best example, take <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46814-check-out-two-unreleased-j-dilla-tracks/"" target=""_blank"">""Dillatroit""</a>, on which a trio of rappers sandwich a chorus of Detroit pride with undignified shots at Charles Hamilton, who had the gall to claim a J Dilla production credit on his debut album, <i>This Perfect Life</i>. Just to give you an idea of the way they hold grudges in Detroit, this blasphemy was committed all the way back in 2009. And yet Hamilton (who has all but disappeared from rap) still finds an entire verse dedicated to him on a song that's supposed to pay tribute.</p>
<p>The best moments come when Dilla's music is allowed to breathe, complemented by a competent artist. There's nothing quite like hearing a talented rapper rip through one of his beats. The highlight here is Danny Brown on ""Jay Dee's Revenge"".  There's no perfunctory Dilla or Detroit shoutouts on the song; just an ill beat with a burbling mess of bass, sparkling keys, and a perverted madman rhyming his ass off. Other highlights include the one-two punch of soul and instrumental tracks ""Let's Pray Together"" and ""Requiem"", both of which show a bit more of the producer's range. ""Let's Pray Together"" in particular is a reminder of the best of neo-soul, as Detroit legend Amp Fiddler croons smoothly over slow, descending funk.</p>
<p>There are other worthwhile tracks like the elegant ""Detroit Madness"" or ""Do It for Dilla Dawg"", which, despite being saddled with that name, finds Dilla's little brother Illa J and old friend Frank Nitt overcoming cliché and showing real love. But when at least 16 of 21 songs are dedicated to the same subject, it's pretty easy to pick out tracks that should have been pruned.  </p>
<p>The quote at the top comes from the Stussy documentary on Dilla, which was released in 2010. Though it seems pretty cut and dry, it shows up in the part of the movie where Dilla's friends and collaborators are speculating on why he moved to Los Angeles, most of them surprised that someone so firmly attached to Detroit would leave his hometown. House Shoes, another Detroit transplant, whose DJing is referenced on the penultimate track, ends up supplying the answer. ""The Detroit shit'll wear you out,"" he says. ""Cats want to come out here... and get the love that they never got in their own city.""</p>
<p>Six years after his death, Dilla gets that love in full on <i>Rebirth of Detroit</i>. But the exhausting nature of the record, and the somewhat limited portrait of Dilla's work that it leaves behind, reminds us why he moved. Your hometown defines you only as much as you let it-- but when you're gone, those left behind are free to enshrine you, creating hagiography that's at once adoring and dehumanizing. As an artist, Dilla was defined by his need for growth, constantly evolving. But once you're cast in stone, it becomes pretty difficult to move.</p></div>"|16731.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16731-rebirth-of-detroit/|6.5|Jonah Bromwich

But <a href=""http://bosse-de-nage.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bosse-De-Nage</a> did just that. Last year, on the backs of two willfully obscure 2006 demos and a 2010 LP that gathered recordings from 2007, they came seemingly out of nowhere to deliver one of the most intriguing, aristocratically depraved black metal recordings of 2011. That album, <i>II</i>, was released by San Francisco's Flenser Records, and the follow-up, <i>III</i>, comes courtesy of Profound Lore, a fitting home for the forward-thinking, shadowy quartet. With their last record, they peered into the mouth of madness. With its successor, they embrace it.</p>
<p>Bosse-De-Nage's idea of black metal is quite different from what the genre's granddaddies had in mind; we're not talking Bathory here, or even Horna. The messengers have changed, but the power remains. The band's take on the genre is closer to what Ash Borer or even Drudkh have done, in that their incorporation of outside elements comes across as organic and unassuming, and downright powerful at its peak. In BDN's case, many of the core values of black metal (nihilism, irreligion, anti-humanism) live on within their lyrics, the arching storylines and unnerving chronicles of the evil that men do. Existential anguish reigns, and nothing is okay.</p>
<p>Their affinity for shoegaze, post-hardcore, screamo, and even indie rock courses through each composition, weaving their influence around each blackened chord and tremolo clawing like silver threads spiking iron ore. Gentle, contemplative passages recall the French predilection towards summertime blues and verdant atmospheres, offering temporary flashes of respite on a difficult album. The album's centerpiece, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13688-the-god-ennui/"" target=""_blank"">""The God Ennui""</a>, is comparatively speaking, the most straightforward track on <i>III</i>, and the first three minutes of the song's nearly 11-minute running time are the most beautiful thing that the band has ever recorded. They seize Alcest mastermind Neige's formula, delving deeply into the sprightly, wistful ""post-black"" meanderings that the Gallic legions have kept such a stranglehold upon as of late, and allow it to fester ever so slightly. If the philosophers of Deathspell Omega covered one of Alcest's gossamer pseudo-black fairytales, the results might not lie too far from what Bosse-De-Nage are doing.</p>
<p>That's not to say that Bosse-De-Nage subscribe fully to the kinder, gentler side of what passes for black metal in 2012. There are plenty of moments of outright aggression, bleak, harrowing passages of unrelenting blasts, narrated by a chaotic, urgent voice that veers between angry wails and sparse, Slint-like sotto voce intonations depending on the lyrical bent. It's an intense listen, and a wholly cathartic one as well. The album's last track, ""An Ideal Ledge"", informs us that ""there's a ledge somewhere set against a deadly precipice, which Spring's nostalgic winds never reach,"" then proceeds to take us out to the very edge and force us to look down into the yawning void between Scylla and Charybdis. If you know what's good for you, you'll dig your fingernails into the side of that mountain, and then let go.</p></div>"|16770.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16770-iii/|7.9|Kim Kelly

Kelly</a> fans. Even his best-loved (and plain best) albums, like 2003's world-conquering and rep-rehabilitating <i>Chocolate Factory</i>, feel like collections of blindingly slick singles padded with soggy ballads, awkward collaborations, and half-baked conceptual art pieces masquerading as R&amp;B songs. So it's easy, in retrospect, to see the uniform goodness of 2011's <i>Love Letter</i> as an unexpected stroke of luck. Though marred by some chintzy synthesized orchestral sections from a guy you knew could afford actual horns and strings, it was the first of Kelly's albums since the early 1990s where he didn't trip himself up by overreaching. He simply wrote some wonderful mash-notes to the soul and R&amp;B artists who metaphorically reared him as a young aspirant, and sang those songs at the top of his not-inconsiderable abilities.</p>
<p>The problem with <i>Write Me Back</i> is that it doesn't go far enough. By that, I don't mean he should have returned to the maniacal story-songs he drove into the ground after ""Trapped in the Closet"", cranked up the sex metaphors to an even more deranged degree, or gone cherry-picking the hottest new sounds. A more restrained, classicist, and <i>focused</i> R. Kelly was a good look, especially since enough of his irrepressible weirdness is always going to shine through and keep things from feeling too buttoned-up.</p>
<p>But the care, craft and subtlety of <i>Love Letter</i> is audible only in flashes on <i>Write Me Back</i>. Kelly seems to have breezed through the writing and recording process here, and there's a fine line between breezy and half-assed. (At least the crummy parts of Kelly's older albums had a misguided messianic ambition behind them.) The cheap faux-orchestrations are back, too, and they sound especially shabby backing the total conviction of Kelly's engaged vocal performances.</p>
<p>""Love Is"" comes off like a handful of hacks in an off-strip Vegas bar, armed with a couple of Casios and a surprisingly good frontman, doing their best Barry White impression for a bunch of disinterested daytime drunks. By the end of the song, Kelly is willing himself back to the high ""Soul Train"" era, trying to turn its ersatz disco into the real deal. The fact that he almost succeeds gives you some indication, right at the album's start, that the pleasures of <i>Write Me Back</i> are based almost entirely around Kelly's pipes.</p>
<p>""Green Light"" is the type of deep cut covered in Eric Harvey's recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/underscore/8822-quiet-storm-tk-tk-tk/"" target=""_blank"">history of quiet storm radio</a>, and Kelly's vocal is as creamy as any of those classics. It's one of those songs that needs just enough quiver behind the la-la-la's to induce shivers without breaking the low-key mood by oversinging. When he wants to rock the people in the balcony, he's still got it. The lyrics to ""When a Man Lies"" may be boilerplate-- the wise old soulman castigating the faithless and two-faced-- but wow, does he sell that chorus. Still, it'd be nice if the <i>music</i> had half as much force.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, given his depth of knowledge and the more-or-less good taste displayed on <i>Love Letter</i>'s old-school pastiches, the true low points on <i>Write Me Back</i> come when Kelly tries to recreate the 60s, again mostly because the results are so damned chintzy. ""All Rounds on Me"" is like a 1997 ringtone version of a Wilson Pickett obscurity with tinny synthetic horns clanging against surprisingly accurate guitar licks. The lowest-of-the-low is ""Party Jumpin'"", which comes directly after the somnambulant smoothness of ""Green Light"" like someone slapping you awake. And then pouring warm beer on you. Not even Kelly's singing can redeem this epically crappy-sounding tribute to dance crazes, ""American Bandstand"", and the end of every beach-party movie ever.</p>
<p>These cut-rate production choices are, along with the limpness of some of his retro moves, the only ways that Kelly actually embarrasses himself on <i>Write Me Back. </i>Which may be better than the days when he had you questioning his basic mental fitness. Still, given the glimmer of an end-to-end great album we got on <i>Love Letter</i>, it's hard not to be disappointed that unevenness is once again the name of R. Kelly's game.</p></div>"|16797.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16797-write-me-back/|6.5|Jess Harvell

And then <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16172-rich-forever/"" target=""_blank""><i>Rich Forever </i></a>came out in January, a 79-minute <i>Robb Report</i>-style brag that recommended you try the lemon pepper at one of <a href=""http://newsroom.mtv.com/2011/08/05/rick-ross-wingstop/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his Wingstop franchises</a> while finding it unnecessary to mention his brush with death. </p>
<p>Then there was another potentially crippling headline, the one that revealed that Ross' Maybach Music Group label is named after a car that as of 2011 is no longer manufactured because it was apparently a horribly made automobile that almost nobody could afford. The latter half of Maybach's demise makes it a perfect inspiration for a hip-hop collective's name, but it also reveals MMG's formative flaw: Ross had every reason to claim ""excess is just my character"" on Kanye's ""Devil in a New Dress"", and his voice, lyrics, and life in general embody the absurd luxury signified by ""Maybach Music."" But on <i>Self Made 2, </i>he shares the spotlight with his blue-collar, modestly striving underbosses <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10147-wale/"" target=""_blank"">Wale</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29523-stalley/"" target=""_blank"">Stalley</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30022-meek-mill/"" target=""_blank"">Meek Mill</a>, who appear on the same beats sounding like they got there because they've won a game show.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">However, now that they're here, you can sense they feel an utter lack of competition both internally and externally, a problem signified by ""Power Circle"", one of the best cuts on the tape and the most illustrative of MMG's failings. Featuring a sterling verse from every MMG member as well as Gunplay and Kendrick Lamar, it <i>should </i>feel like an event given its eight and half minute runtime. Yet it's not an ""event"" so much as a pretty good MMG track that also happens to be absurdly long for no real reason; no one ever gives the impression that something's at stake here, failing to play off or build upon one another. MMG has chemistry, but no volatility.</p>
<p>Which is a strange thing to say about a crew that has Gunplay on the payroll. ""Power Circle"" is actually credited to Gunplay and rightfully so, since he delivers a verse of pantheon, loose-cannon boasting (""WHERE'S YOUR SEAT AT? WHERE'S YOUR LOBSTER? WHERE'S YOUR SEABASS?""). He and Ross <i>should</i> compose a classic Rae/Ghost, Gucci/Flocka dynamic, but Gunplay wouldn't be nearly as thrilling if you really thought rules and hierarchies applied to him. You sense that he's <i>in </i>MMG but doesn't totally buy into it. He's criminally underutilized here, sounds completely out of place when he does show up, and there's no reason he needs to be trading bars with goons-for-hire like Ace Hood on ""Black on Black"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Still, everyone clearly needs to be subservient to Ross and even if <i>Self Made </i>comes to life every time he shows up, he's not wasting his best stuff here, refusing to let coherence get in the way of saying the most ridiculous baller shit possible. Observe: ""My bank account Jewish,"" which I assume he means in a totally opposite way <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ0iUNI0ncc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">than Malice did</a>, and as far as ""My bitch bad, lookin' like a bag of money"" (the hook from ""Bag of Money"", natch) goes, I don't think women like being compared to formless sacks, but Ross <i>really</i> likes money, so a compliment's a compliment. But it'll be years before any of us can even remotely ascertain what exactly he means by ""The square root of a kilo is me!!!"" and that moment serves as the peak of <i>Self Made. </i>It happens within the first 20 seconds.</p>
<p>From there on out, Stalley and Wale take up the majority of <i>Self Made </i>and they can be considered complementary in some aspects: Wale fears his ""haters wanna see me catch diabetes from humble pie,"" whereas Stalley totally carb loads on it. ""Lost in the instrumental/ Keys got me sentimental"" is Stalley's M.O. not just on ""Fountain of Youth"" but in general, and while he's ostensibly meant to contribute ballast to Ross' hot air, his relentless self-effacement can be a drag. As for Wale, he remains an undeniably talented MC bent on constructing the least likeable persona in all of hip-hop. He's still humanized by some beyond goofy punchlines like ""shout outs Seattle, but these rappers, they stealin' my <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thunder</a>."" Wale sounds utterly joyless while popping bottles, tags, and bras, but in some sad way, you almost have to admire the sheer pomposity dedicated to the tyrannical ignorance of ""Actin' Up"" (hook: ""These hoes be actin' up/ And these niggas be lettin' 'em"").</p>
<p>Mill is the guy who's actually done the most to distinguish himself as a solo artist on these tapes. Though the first <i>Self Made </i>was also pretty lackluster, Mill's ""Tupac Back"" willed its way into meme-worthy ubiquity, and the obvious task is to find something similar here. The bombastic ""Black Magic"" comes close and it's the standout on <i>Self Made, </i>but it's less down to Mill's double-time showmanship than<i> </i>Ross' ""woop!"" on the hook; much like ""Tupac Back"", Mill still feels like the featured artist even though the song is technically his. Otherwise, it's hard to find much else that really sticks-- ""I Be Puttin' On"" and ""Bag of Money"" feature top-shelf rap/R&amp;B hookmen (Roscoe Dash, T-Pain) but only half-finished hooks. French Montana charms with some heavy-lidded guest spots and new signing Omarion sounds suspiciously like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29508-frank-ocean/"" target=""_blank"">Frank Ocean</a> these days. Though it's hard to imagine anyone who wouldn't prefer even more rote ""I'm Not a Star"" reduxes as a replacement for O's perfectly competent and forgettable solo joints.</p>
<p>Of course, it's important that <i>Self Made. 2 </i>actually exists to force-feed Hot 97 playlists rather than doing something other than coast off career momentum. These sort of label showcases have a long and not particularly illustrious history, and while it'd be nice to hear MMG follow the template set by the Ruff Ryders comps and take some wild production chances, or imitate the Diplomatic Immunity series by developing a functional team gameplan, it really doesn't do much to signal the demise of MMG any more than the actual shuttering of Maybach. Those dud singles Ross has been releasing from <i>God Forgives, I Don't</i>-- <i>those </i>we should worry about.</p></div>"|16879.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16879-mmg-self-made-vol-2/|6.2|Ian Cohen

Named for 1968-72 Mac singer-guitarist Danny Kirwan, ""The Kirwan Song"" set a precedent for playing spot-the-references that the Swedish band's history-bursting blend of pastoral-England-meets-Laurel-Canyon psych-pop and folk-rock only invites further. Throw in a lineup that includes members of Swedish-language psych-rock monsters <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1225-dungen/"" target=""_blank"">Dungen</a>, and you could be forgiven for wondering if liking this stuff requires Talmudic knowledge of, say, the 80s Paisley Underground movement.</p>
<p>It doesn't. Happily, the Amazing's music is less reverent of its post-gold-rush past than might be obvious at first blush. Both on 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13882-the-amazing/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Amazing</i></a> and 2010's equally impressive <i>Wait for the Light to Come</i> mini-album, the band's impressionistically melancholy songwriting and gracefully unspooling instrumentals push toward the sort of poetic textural subtleties associated with post-rock or shoegaze. Simply put, it sounds pretty in headphones-- even if you can't quite make out all that frontman Christoff Gunrup is singing. He does use English, at least, though often here it's the feeling, the overall construction, that matters more.</p>
<p>Reine Fisk, who plays a mean lead guitar in Dungen as well as this band, has said all of the Amazing's records so far are roughly similar in mood, and he isn't kidding. Second proper LP <i>Gentle Stream</i>, out late last year overseas and due for a stateside release this fall on Partisan, by and large sticks to the Amazing's previous tendency to glide between winsome acoustic ballads and brawnier rockers, stretching out with easy-riding guitar solos and thoughtful, Mellotron-touched arrangements. References are still tough to avoid, whether it's <i>Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</i>-era Neil Young and Crazy Horse on the organ-glazed title track, Nick Drake on the yearning flute- and sax-framed ""Flashlight"", or Simon and Garfunkel circa ""Dangling Conversations"" on bastards-rueing ""The Fog"". But as pleasantly jangly video selection ""Gone"" and harmony-bursting European-edition finale ""When the Colours Change"" best exemplify, this album is far richer than retro pastiche.</p>
<p>Gunrup's dewy vocals carry melodies that refuse to dissipate over multiple listens, and the drumming, in particular, makes these songs stand out, with a jazzy, rambling, naturalistic quality, punchy in just the right places. The descending Led Zeppelin riffage of ""Dogs"" might go on a little too long, and the mostly vocal-based, sub-two-minute ""Assumptions"" is the only real change-up. But when Gunrup sings, on the languidly shuffling American bonus track ""Ghosts"", of ways to ""drive off the ghosts,"" he shouldn't be worried. Like other bands such as the Clientele, the Kings of Convenience, and Tame Impala, the Amazing have exorcized their turn-of-the-70s spooks by embracing<i> </i>the evanescent. A fine follow-up, <i>Gentle Stream</i> captures its namesake in soft, skilled hands.</p></div>"|16842.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16842-gentle-stream/|7.3|Marc Hogan

Like an idiot, I found myself walking around downtown in jeans and a button-up, backpack grafted to my shoulders from sweat, the city's own psych-tinged synth-poppers <a href=""http://www.alull.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Lull</a>'s <i>Meat Mountain</i> EP in my ear. I'd spent the week in my climate-controlled apartment grappling with the record, which-- with its wavery synths and clattering polyrhythms and watery post-Animal Collective harmonies-- never quite leapt out of the speakers the way I kept expecting. But out there in that heat, dodging the glint of that nasty old sun, frontman Nigel Evan Dennis telling me to ""feel it with [my] heart,"" well, I certainly felt something.</p>
<p><i>Meat Mountain</i> comes hot on the heels of A Lull's 2011 twofer, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15466-confetti/"" target=""_blank""><i>Confetti</i></a> and its accompanying <i>Confetti Reprise</i>. The <i>Confetti</i> LP in particular seemed, as David Bevan mentioned in his review, especially beholden to the icy geometry of Sigur Rós singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14098-go/"" target=""_blank"">Jonsi's 2010 solo affair, <i>Go</i></a>, all these brightly colored pieces jigsawed and prismatically reassembled. But there's a warmth to <i>Meat Mountain</i> somewhat absent from the fussier <i>Confetti</i>; it's production's a watercolor haze, and there's some Beach Boys DNA buried deep in their elongated harmonies. You'll hear plenty of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10025-person-pitch/"" target=""_blank""><i>Person Pitch</i></a> in Dennis' elongated vowel sounds and all the samples running up and down <i>Meat Mountain</i>'s sides, a bit of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5506-yeasayer/"" target=""_blank"">Yeasayer</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5789-abe-vigoda/"" target=""_blank"">Abe Vigoda</a> alike in Dennis' swooping vocals and the band's tricky rhythms, and the warm pinks and oranges of its washed-out sonics aren't a far cry from chillwave. But grousing on about a lack of originality in 2012 increasingly seems like a fool's errand, especially for a record as warm and unassuming as <i>Meat Mountain</i>. Besides, these guys mostly take the good stuff and leave the rest; just as they tamped down some of Jonsi's more cloying tendencies on <i>Confetti</i>, there's little of Yeasayer's up-with-people earnestness or Abe Vigoda's recent self-serious streak to be found here.</p>
<p><i>Meat Mountain</i> really opens up in headphones; their dual drummers dance around the stereo field, the zig-zagging synths and samples and occasional saxophone bleat all get teased out. Arrangements stay busy without overcluttering themselves, although Dennis' vocals sometimes get so swept up in a sea of harmonies-- or, on ""Not About It"", a falsetto to rival Passion Pit's Michael Angelakos-- as to make it a little unclear what he's saying. Get close enough to <i>Meat Mountain</i>, though, and you'll hear the longing in Dennis' voice regardless of the intelligibility of the lyric. ""I don't know about the small of her back or the length of her legs, but I know you don't love her,"" he sings on highlight ""Beaches"", and that whiff of unrequited love hangs over the record like a late-afternoon haze. I do wish Dennis would step out in front of the music a bit more; there was a confidence to his <i>Confetti</i> vocals that feels somewhat tempered here, and with its melodies constantly bending and pulling themselves apart, the music could have been centered by Dennis' voice, were he not doing so much swooping himself. But all that makes you lean ever closer into <i>Meat Mountain</i> to get to the heart of the thing; it all seems a bit noncommittal at first, but the more time you spend with it, the more the songs' impressionistic shapes and colors come together to form a complete picture.</p>
<p><i>Meat Mountain</i>'s not a knockout; for an EP that runs barely over 20 minutes, there's a bit too much drift, too many overlong intros, and verses that take their sweet time getting around to the chorus. But, far from being a holdover from their prolific 2011, <i>Meat Mountain</i> finds A Lull very casually nudging themselves in a different, more expansive direction. Yeah, a few more ideas of their own probably couldn't hurt, and a little more of Dennis in the mix would be welcome.

Unlike those aforementioned dudes, Cohen is pretty by-the-book: On <i>Mostly No</i>, there are no <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=718vOM6whXY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">scuzzbag rockabilly numbers</a>, no <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Ty+Segall+Band/_/Fuzz+War"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fuzz wars</a>, no <a href=""http://spacin.bandcamp.com/track/clips-from-deep-thuds"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ambient brain-slushers</a>. There are some gnarly rave-ups, for sure, but none worthy of a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16667-king-tuff/"" target=""_blank"">record sleeve sporting a be-skulled, axe-wielding bat</a>. Instead of shooting from the hip, Cohen prefers to shoot straight, using a tried-and-true DIY template-- he recorded the album at home on 16-track tape, with a band that sounds less crack than cozily lived-in-- to expand on the ideas he put forth on last year's debut LP, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15727-yucca/"" target=""_blank""><i>Yucca</i></a>.</p>
<p>Things are so crowded these days, it seems as if the only way to sop up all the sweat is with a tattered freak flag. But for Cohen, standing out seems to come by way of blending into the bigger picture, utilizing simple, time-honored song structures and tempos to write solid, straightforward songs that feel loose and organic, but still thoroughly considered. Less grown-over with static than his previous effort, <i>Mostly No</i> isn't afraid to slow things down and let a little light in. Take centerpiece ""Bad Luck"", a lurching, bottom-heavy cut that offsets its own born-in disaffection with a dusty kind of free-spiritedness that Tom Petty could probably get along with. It's not the best song on the album, but rather a convenient guidepost that points to Cohen's focus here: No frills, no dicking around, just the solid rendering of a quality recipe, with plenty of spotlight reserved for guitars that sound as if they're testing high levels of radon.</p>
<p>Cohen really writes only three kinds of songs on <i>Mostly No</i>: the four-on-the-floor thrashers, the strummy acoustic numbers (mostly skippable save for ""Pictures of Stone"", which gives him the chance to try on a pretty good-looking desert mystic's cloak), and the mid-tempo jams that give him a little room to try and explore and spread his wings a bit. <i>Mostly No</i> is a record that eschews any manic highs or crushing lows in favor of an affable sort of middle ground, and usually with pretty welcoming results. ""Your Neck Around Mine"" and ""Stir So Slow"" (which features a nifty little solo that sounds like a werewolf-pawed Neil Young noodling around) are slow(er)-riders evocative of acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs/"" target=""_blank"">the War on Drugs</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"" target=""_blank"">Kurt Vile</a>, spiked with a refreshing splash of golden FM-dial haze. But on the nearly five-minute-long (and perhaps too aptly titled) ""Old Trick"", the format feels a bit draggy, as Cohen tries to conjure up a climax but only manages to squeak out an ""in case you missed it"" kind of recap. Sure, <i>Mostly No</i> is a record that works largely in part thanks to Cohen's finding his comfort zone and hitting a slack sweet-spot, but it's psych-lite tracks like ""Old Trick"" that could still benefit from a zap of go-for-broke energy.</p>
<p>So it's safe to say that the more raucous shit really helps open things up. Lead-offs ""Dopamine"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13483-do-right/"" target=""_blank"">""Do Right""</a> are perfectly calibrated for the season, burning hot and extra-heavy like beach anthems for the dirty kids who'd rather sit up on the boardwalk and smoke. Even better is the one-two punch of ""Summertime"" and ""Drag to Find"", the latter of which is even more blissful, humid, and blown-out in the most perfectly cottony manner. If you are stoned and/or own a beater of an old convertible, you're going to want to get in on this action immediately. Still, these tracks are part of a bigger, very well proportioned plate, and come off more as complimentary rather than stand-out when set aside on their own. It's a testament to Cohen's ability to create a cohesive, engaging listen-- it just so happens that it's one better taken in a single dose. But as far as bringing the goods on a sophomore release goes, well, the answer is mostly yeah.</p></div>"|16751.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16751-mostly-no/|6.8|Zach Kelly

Emerging on Sub Pop in 2000-- just before the label's Shins-assisted second wind-- the L.A. country-rockers may have been an anomaly on their own label, but they were waving the flag for a new cosmic Americana alongside the more revered likes of the Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, Grandaddy, and Sparklehorse. The Sparks, however, were the most earthbound of the bunch, favoring egalitarian group vocals over a dominating presence and an easy-going West Coast groove over grandiose gestures (though their roots-rock purism was flexible enough to accommodate at least <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2l3FY6K2IE&amp;ob=av2n"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one great Sade cover</a>). By 2003, they'd quietly splintered into myriad offshoot acts (the Tyde, Mystic Chords of Memory, and the sadly overlooked All Night Radio). While Sub Pop has since <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5653-fleet-foxes/"" target=""_blank"">figured out how to sell long-haired harmony groups to the masses</a>, the Sparks still feel better suited to intimate campfire congregations than soft-seater-theaters. The band's first new album in 10 years feels every bit out of time and place as their debut did back in 2000. It's like some accidentally discovered, immaculately preserved turn-of-the-1970s obscurity stumbled upon in your local record store's dustiest dollar bin.</p>
<p>Beachwood Sparks initially reunited in 2008 for Sub Pop's 20th-anniversary celebrations, so they have had a few years to figure out how to be a band again. But damn if they don't make it sound so easy on <i>The Tarnished Gold</i>, which presents Beachwood Sparks exactly how we remembered them: loose, playful, and coolly unpretentious, but capable of making you weak-kneed in an instant with a simple melancholic melody, turn of phrase, and weepy guitar lead. The only indication that this band had been mothballed for the better part of a decade comes through the knowing lyrics: The gorgeously understated opener ""Forget the Song"" begins with a line-- ""It's time to stop pretending/ Those days are gone""-- that essentially serves as a challenge to the band to honor its legacy; the freewheeling dust-up ""Sparks Fly Again"" responds in kind by giving the reformed band its own celebratory theme song. The bleary title track, meanwhile, sees Gunst coming to terms with the Sparks' split (""Funny how when you find what you're looking for/ It was already there""). And on ""Earl Jean"", he effectively sums up the the band's current condition when he proudly sings: ""Back in town/ Out of style."" (Even a covert guest appearance from Ariel Pink bears no modernizing influence.)</p>
<p>Beachwood Sparks' final pre-breakup release, 2003's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/599-make-the-cowboy-robots-cry-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Make the Cowboy Robots Cry</i> EP</a>, was the band's shortest non-single release but also its most meandering, as it awkwardly tried to stretch their humble sound into something unnecessarily epic. <i>The Tarnished Gold</i> effectively glosses over that aberration to reassert the group's real strength: soft-focussed, sunset balladry, best exemplified here by the Dead-reckoning ""Water From the Well"", and the slow-dissolve serenity of ""Leave That Light On"", whose aquatic ambience posits it as a distant cousin to Hendrix's ""May This Be Love?"". (Thankfully, deviations from this gameplan, like the silly mariachi-band exercise ""No Queremos Oro"" and the cheeky bluegrass gospel of ""The Orange Grass Special"", are limited to brief two-minute spurts.) It's unclear at this point if <i>The Tarnished Gold</i> represents the beginning of a new chapter for Beachwood Sparks, or whether it's the proper last hurrah the band couldn't muster in their first go-round. (The album's closing hymn ""Goodbye"" along with bassist Brent Rademaker's closing quote in <a href=""http://www.subpop.com/bio/beachwood_sparks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this bio</a> supports the latter theory.) But, at this moment, <i>The Tarnished Gold</i> is an impressively vital showing from a group that deserves to be known as something more than that other <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"" target=""_blank"">Beach band on Sub Pop</a>.</p></div>"|16755.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16755-the-tarnished-gold/|7.7|Stuart Berman

Some 33 years after pressing up copies of <i>Dreamin' Wild</i>, only to have it sit in their home studio erected solely for its creation (right next to a concert venue erected 30 yards from the house), its dream is finally turning into a realization. </p>
<p>For an album whose renaissance can be traced back to record collector Jack Fleischer encountering a sealed copy sitting on a mantelpiece in a Spokane antique shop-- far from any other dusty record in the place-- and posting an entry on his <a href=""http://bubblingdusk.blogspot.co.uk/2010/06/dennis-harte-on-roundtable.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Out of the Bubbling Dusk</a> blog, it's taken a curious and circuitous route to its current renaissance. Ariel Pink bassist Tim Koh championed it on his <a href=""http://www.lamaraba.blogspot.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LAMARABA</a> blog, <a href=""http://soul-sides.com/2010/01/donnie-and-joe-emerson-livin-the-dream/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soul Sides</a> repped for it while another blog mocked its cheesy cover. It also popped up on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28543-memoryhouse/"" target=""_blank"">Memoryhouse</a>'s <a href=""http://www.self-titledmag.com/2012/01/02/download-this-now-memoryhouse-this-will-be-our-year-the-zombies-cover/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mixtape for Self-Titled Magazine</a> and nu-disco producer Psychemagick slotted it alongside Czech disco and Italian synth-prog on his <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Light-Sounds-Dark-Psychemagik-After-The-Void/master/322592"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>After the Void</i> compilation</a>. </p>
<p>This year alone, Donnie and Joe Emerson's stunning soul ballad ""Baby"" has been covered by dubstep rapscallions Hype Williams on their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16566-black-is-beautiful/"" target=""_blank""><i>Black Is Beautiful</i></a> album (without crediting the original), while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28716-ariel-pinks-haunted-graffiti/"" target=""_blank"">Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti</a> collaborated with Dâm-Funk for their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13722-baby/"" target=""_blank"">soulful rendition of the same song</a>. Originally intended for a forthcoming Light in the Attic compilation, Ariel and Dâm's cover ended up being chosen as the first single from Ariel's forthcoming album, <i>Mature Themes</i>. Not bad for a financial disaster that derailed a teen's dream and nearly bankrupted the Emerson family, decimating their acreage from 1,600 down to 65 via a woeful bank loan taken out at 18% back in the late 70s. Remastered ever so gently, with fascinating investigative liner notes from <a href=""http://www.thestranger.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Stranger</a>'s Dave Segal (a former editor of mine), the full story behind the album is far more bizarre than the sight of a white jumpsuited, two-headed brother against a JCPenney's portrait backdrop on the cover would lead you to believe. </p>
<p>In some ways, the Emersons' story runs parallel to that of the Wiggins sisters from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3751-shaggs/"" target=""_blank"">Shaggs</a>. Just as that their father decided that his girls could make their own music and not just rehash what was emanating from the radio, Don Emerson Sr. also wanted his sons to play their own music and not simply regurgitate the pop hits of the day. It's only natural for a father to encourage creativity in his sons, but Don Sr. went well beyond ordering a Danelectro guitar out of the Sears-Roebuck catalog and calling it a day. Instead, he took out a loan with his land as leverage in order to erect a log cabin for the boys to woodshed in, then furnished it into a full-blown studio, complete with a TEAC 8-track, amplifiers, drum kit, PolyMoog, and more. (And that's saying nothing of ""Camp Jammin'"": a 300-capacity venue that their father also erected on the property, complete with his/her bathrooms, concession area, balcony and green room.)</p>
<p class=""p1"">And unlike the Shaggs' endearing/excruciating <i>Philosophy of the World,</i> Donnie and Joe can sing, write songs, and <i>play</i>. In between logging, fence-post digging, and other farm chores, the boys practiced nonstop and put <i>Dreamin' Wild</i> to tape with little idea of what was happening in popular music (they barely even knew how to load a reel of tape in their studio) other than what emanated from the radio. Listening through, you catch glints of Smokey Robinson, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5826-hall-and-oates/"" target=""_blank"">Hall and Oates</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19993-the-commodores/"" target=""_blank"">the Commodores</a>, Bread, Pablo Cruise, Boz Scaggs and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24900-chuck-mangione/"" target=""_blank"">Chuck Mangione</a> amid the AM bullion. Blue-eyed soul, meandering funk (see ""Feels Like the Sun"" which encourages you to ""sing or play a musical instrument along with the boys""), and landlocked yacht rock are evident. Yet the wide-eyed and utterly sincere vision of a 17-year old Donnie stuns. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Whenever he takes a guitar solo-- or when he drops an unhinged psychedelic Moog blast on the vamp of ""Give Me the Chance""-- his talent is prodigal. That he can then endeavor a naked piano ballad like ""Dream Full of Dreams"", deftly wrapping a warm synth line around it, hints at what his future as a songwriter or producer might have been like. Psychedelic slow-burner ""My Heart"" even shows him knowing how to bring an album to a satisfying close. In another century, Donnie Sr. could have saved the Emerson land by simply uploading a video of his son singing to YouTube and waited for international acclaim that way. Instead, we are left with a curious what-if album that during its finest moments-- to twist a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4651-brian-wilson/"" target=""_blank"">Brian Wilson</a> phrase -- is a godlike symphony to teenhood. </p></div>"|16841.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16841-dreamin-wild/|8.0|Andy Beta

It's also his ""political record,"" commenting (sometimes obliquely, other times more directly) on the budget austerity measures currently being taken by the British government and how they've affected the country's poor. But if you listen to <i>Sky's Edge</i> without paying attention to the lyrics, it's most obviously Hawley's ""loud guitar"" record, and therefore his ""does anybody really want this kind of record from Richard Hawley?"" record.</p>
<p>The rigid formula that Hawley has refined with minor alterations for more than a decade--strings and reverb-drenched ballads sung in a low, laconic voice-- has been blown up and tripped out. The songs on <i>Sky's Edge</i> blast off to far-away solar systems, rather than hovering close to the ground like spooky phantoms. ""Leave Your Body Behind You"" references the 13th Floor Elevators, but the droning dreaminess of <i>Sky's Edge</i> is more in the vein of mid-90s bong-addled British psych-rock. Where Hawley typically reaches all the way to the back-country sultriness of early Elvis Presley and the apocalyptic emotionalism of 60s-era Scott Walker for inspiration, he's now referencing his own long-lost past as a recovering Brit-popper. </p>
<p>For a singer-songwriter who appears to embody his out-of-time, rockabilly romantic persona as completely off-stage as he does on record, it's a curious choice to finally make an album that's reminiscent of his largely forgotten stint as a member of the mid-90s group Longpigs. Back then, Hawley was only the guitar player, dutifully stroking out big, clanking guitar riffs in the popular neo-hippie mold of the Verve and Oasis at its most fookin' druggy. It was enough to impress U2, who took the group under their wing and invited Hawley and company to open some dates on the ill-fated 1997 PopMart tour. But Longpigs unceremoniously whiffed in its swing for stardom, which made Hawley's subsequent reinvention necessary and, all things considered, relatively easy. </p>
<p>But now Hawley is back making mysteriously murky and all-enveloping six-string swirls on <i>Sky's Edge</i>, uncorking winding and mind-bending guitar solos and burying his own distinctive vocals in the process. The result is the most outwardly aggressive music of Hawley's solo career, as well as the most generic. The opener ""She Brings the Sunlight"" starts off with a low rumble that builds to a whirring and squawky climax over the course of seven draggy minutes, creating little of the unsettling atmosphere that Hawley normally specializes in, even as it seemingly works twice as hard to achieve it. Boilerplate bluster also overwhelms the title track, which references a neighborhood outside of Hawley's hometown of Sheffield known for its history of crime and gambling. Hawley leans on poor-people clichés in the lyrics (""She had to sell her body/ To put shoes on her feet"") before the arena-jocking drums and grinding guitar riff fully drain the song of any lingering subtlety.</p>
<p><i>Sky's Edge </i>is the follow-up to the sparest record of Hawley's career, 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13452-trueloves-gutter/"" target=""_blank""><i>Truelove's Gutter</i></a>, which stripped his music to the barest of essentials: a forlorn baritone, a somberly strummed guitar, some lightly tapped drums, a weeping violin or two. It would've been impossible to go any further in <i>that </i>direction, but <i>Sky's Edge </i>is an over-correction, if not an out-and-out miscalculation by Hawley of his own strengths. It's disheartening to hear him slip into his familiar, comfortable croon at the start of ""Don't Stare at the Sun"", and then gerrymander the track into an overblown, ""Live at Red Rocks!""-style crescendo. Hawley's songs are meant to be played up close, at barely above a whisper; they sound awfully ordinary when they're extrapolated and flung toward the cheap seats.<i> Sky's Edge </i>has some of the old Hawley magic in the form of ""The Wood Collier's Grave"", with its Ennio Morricone guitar and swampy synths, and the relatively understated pop tune ""Seek It"", a straight-forward proclamation of devotion by a poor bloke ""blinded by love."" But for the most part, it's an unwelcome return to a less distinguished period in Hawley's career, back before he knew how to make more beguiling music than this.</p></div>"|16840.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16840-standing-at-the-skys-edge/|5.1|Steven Hyden

But while his debut LP <i>Holiday</i> lacks cultural cachet or wow factor, there's another kind of immediacy here if you're wired a certain way. This kind of spare urban brooding is often the result of some serious heartbreak, making you want to <i>really </i>listen for the lyrics. Whether Principe has endured the kind of personal tragedy that sometimes makes its way into press kits is ultimately irrelevant. This record is intensely absorbing based solely on what it's willing to explicitly share.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">If it sounds like I'm describing a scenario simlar to the one that greeted <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13196-hospice/"" target=""_blank"">the Antlers' <i>Hospice </i></a>back in 2009, it's for good reason. Principe is a collaborator and childhood friend of Antlers frontman Pete Silberman, and from that you could fashion a reasonable Okkervil River/Shearwater relationship dynamic. They share musical ideas, but the Antlers are more typical of a rock band that prefers demonstrative, emotional storytelling and skyscraping choruses, while Port St. Willow are more attuned to impressionism and studied musicianship.  <i>Holiday </i>can fool you into thinking Principe isn't alone; it's a rich and lush record where most of the textures could still be conceivably looped and performed by one guy. There are unorthodox, yet hooky percussive patterns that almost wholly forgo kicks, snare hits and hi-hats, washes of soft, harmonic feedback, silvery filigrees of guitar.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Most of the songs on <i>Holiday </i>glide past five minutes, but there's a lightness and subtle evolution to Principe's arrangements that make <i>Holiday</i> a surprisingly brisk listen. What it lacks in traditional hooks, it compensates for with distinct and weighty gestures. The sophisticated melody contained with the guitar chords of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13725-amawalk/"" target=""_blank"">""Amawalk""</a> is power-pop turned slower-than-slowcore, leading up to a brass funeral march. An overdub of militaristic drum rolls pushes the already tense ""Hollow"" to the <i>Holiday</i>'s earliest hints at catharsis, while the moaning peals of Principe's vocals on ""Orphan"" imply the release might never come. Within the instrumental and textural cohesion, reverb often determines mood, and it's rare to hear it as carefully and purposefully utilized as it is here. Just listen to how the mix dries up after the beatific ""On Your Side"" and allows for the dour drone of ""Corners"" to sound truly lonely.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">There's little sweet or airy about Principe's falsetto, and his lyrics are akin to his arrangements, conceptually heavy but rendered with a gentle touch. It's sometimes difficult to know exactly what he's getting at. Family relationships (birth, orphanage, fatherhood) are encoded within the terse nature of his lyrics (""slow your breathing,"" ""I won't be a father in a family that runs deep,"" ""don't push me off the ledge you've grown to love""), suggesting conversations between isolated people. The words are evocative rather than exploitative, hinting at trauma having been processed and all that's left is a deep, muscular ache.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>Holiday </i>is so clearly intended as a single piece that I hesitate to suggest it's missing something, but I do find myself wishing for Principe to go all-in either lyrically or sonically. On a record like <i>Hospice, </i>the extroverted likes of ""Sylvia"" or ""Bear"" provided easy entry points, giving an indication that it was a deeply personal record meant to be related to on a mass scale. <i>Holiday</i>'s goals might be different; it's by no means self-indulgent or abrasive or impenetrable, but I hear a record that Principe needed to make whether or not he sought an audience. That said, <i>Holiday </i>deserves an audience, and it'll be interesting to see how Principe reacts to knowing someone's listening in.</p>

What greater insult to willing ears than a band boasting about how little effort they've put into something, how artless they profess their so-called art to be? Plopping the current crop of herky-jerky British indie bands into a science-fair situation, Kotki Dwa are the kids that turn up with a fully functioning Rube Goldberg device designed to delight and surprise, whilst <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29550-the-vaccines/"" target=""_blank"">the Vaccines</a> idly spoon baking powder into a jug of Coca Cola and call it ""explosive."" If it all goes to shit and comes to nothing, at least Kotki Dwa know they tried, though there's no real danger of that.</p>
<p>Kotki Dwa's Alex and Tristan Ostrowski, along with school pal Tom Walker, appealed to Britain's <a href=""http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">National Trust</a> (a conservation charity aimed at protecting important properties, gardens, and nature reserves) for help making <i>Staycations</i>, eschewing a traditional record label in favor of doing something more creative. The Trust agreed, and the band ended up recording the album in a number of their properties across the UK: old mansions, historic gardens, haunted attics, storied bedrooms. Of course, you can't hear this on the record (aside from the odd harpsichord or grand piano that they ran across in these stately old homes, and a bit of roomy ambience), nor can you hear the album's glorious packaging. But the band's enthusiasm for creating a consummate experience sparks throughout <i>Staycations</i>.</p>
<p>The record's closest musical relative in recent years is <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7244-metronomy/"" target=""_blank"">Metronomy</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15337-the-english-riviera/"" target=""_blank""><i>The English Riviera</i></a>, which also conceptually glamorized tepid British climes as escapist boltholes. But <i>Staycations</i> isn't quite as stylistically pristine as Metronomy's third album, its sustained, castigating synths and excitable guitar fizzing like the cogs and whirligigs of a machine in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. They're also a weather-beaten <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/956-clor/"" target=""_blank"">Clor</a>, left to pale on the end of a pier, occasionally a tin-pot <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6054-roxy-music/"" target=""_blank"">Roxy Music</a> with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4685-xtc/"" target=""_blank"">XTC</a>-like tendencies, combining the fervor of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7372-wild-beasts/"" target=""_blank"">Wild Beasts</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12450-limbo-panto/"" target=""_blank"">debut</a> with the lyrical thoughtfulness of their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15436-smother/"" target=""_blank"">last</a>. Those comparisons to British art-rock stalwarts aside, there's plenty novel about Kotki Dwa, not least the fact that their songs don't really have choruses. The only one that does is ""She Likes It"", whose warm analog synths flare like the lights on an arcade machine jacked up on too many volts, before cooing woodwind decorates Alex's reverent description of a lady swimming in a reservoir. The song springs back to life, presumably as the dame splashes him for being such a big, moony fool.</p>
<p>Charm is certainly one of Kotki Dwa's calling cards. The couplet ""Pale streak of mayonnaise/ Why do you hate holidays?"" on the puppyish title track is a perfect mini portrait of a grumpy picnic, though it's also indicative of the disquiet at the heart of <i>Staycations:</i> where unease creeps into picturesque scenes. The skittering piano tangle of ""Bad Timing"" sums up the intrusion neatly toward its end: ""I could be wrong/ But when I see the pictures of the enemy/ The beast has won in some small way/ In silhouette he burns all day."" It's a familiar feeling to anyone who's ever broken their own vow never to look at a foe's online profile, only for their face to linger. Mental conviction is what powers the notion of a so-called ""staycation,"" suspending disbelief and convincing yourself that you're on holiday when you're at home. Happily, none is required to immerse yourself in Kotki Dwa.</p></div>"|16823.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16823-staycations/|7.6|Laura Snapes

The year punk broke was a couple of years after I'd discovered Dinosaur Jr. and Sonic Youth in high school, and much longer after I'd put on hardcore shows in my dad's backyard as a teenager. I remember a winter meeting at the college radio station toward the start of 1992 where the station director and some other DJs were discussing the success of <i>Nevermind</i>, while I-- wearing a Laughing Hyenas shirt and still smelling like sweat from a Jesus Lizard show the night before-- stood there and shook my head. If I'd been even a year older or younger this would've played out differently. But at that time and place I cared more about Slint's <i>Spiderland</i>, My Bloody Valentine's <i>Loveless</i>, Jesus Lizard's <i>Goat</i>, Dinosaur Jr.'s <i>Green Mind</i>, and Sebadoh <i>III</i> in 1991 than I did Nirvana's game-changer. It's also why I was waiting for the New York slow-core trio <a href=""http://www.heartofthunder.com/codeine/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Codeine</a> to follow up their excellent 1990 debut, <i>Frigid Stars</i>.</p>
<p>In 1991, I naively thought Codeine were bigger than they actually were. I was in New Jersey, less than an hour from New York City, and traveled to the city (or Maxwell's in Hoboken or a dude's house in Princeton) to catch them whenever I could. A few friends and I even found a way to have our school pay them decently to come out and play in a lifeless student center. For this small group of punks, hardcore kids, indie rockers, and a sensitive metal dude named Adam, Codeine-- along with affiliated bands Bastro, Bitch Magnet, and eventually Seam-- were huge. We were kids into punk, metal, and flat-out noise, and we found something here to tug onto. It was a gateway. In retrospect, it's interesting how <i>heavy</i> all those bands were, when they also had a reputation for delicacy. </p>
<p>The thing people remember most about Codeine is that their music was very, very slow. And the tempo made it even more powerful. Unlike slow-core bands like Low or Red House Painters, Codeine were associated with Slint and the more abrasive Louisville scene, and brought a kind of post-punk dynamic to their music, no matter how fragile it could get. It was glaciers colliding. The band managed to distill everything to these specific, clean, spacious elements. It made sense that their dynamic final album, <i>The White Birch</i>, featured such snowy cover art: Not only did Codeine's music feel like ice, but unrelentingly sad-sack vocalist/bassist Stephen Immerwahr's eyes reminded me of pools of slush, and watching original drummer Chris Brokaw (who left the group after <i>Barely Real</i> to concentrate on his other band, Come) and then powerful final drummer Doug Scharin (Rex, June of 44, HiM) lay down these quarter-speed beats, always looked to me like someone drowning. Their only real overlap on Sub Pop as far as speed was Earth, but Codeine were doing something quite different.</p>
<p>Numero's new deluxe reissuing of the New York trio's three major releases are long overdue, both as a reminder and a history lesson. The overall collection's been remastered and titled <i>When I See the Sun</i>, something Codeine did not do very often. The label did a great job with the set: 1990's <i>Frigid Stars</i>, 1992's <i>Barely Real</i> EP, and 1994's <i>The White Birch</i> are available here as three double LPs that come with CDs of the same material. Each is packed with Peel Sessions, live and alternate takes, demos, compilation tracks, and B-sides. The albums all include extensive liner notes and essays by important voices from that period like the New York guitarist Alan Licht and Chemical Imbalance's Mike McGonigal (also a Pitchfork contributor), along with distilled oral histories.</p>
<p>Codeine opened their first record with a song called ""D"" and the words, ""D for effort/ D for intent/ D because you pay the rent/ D for love/ D for insight."" And their work doesn't get much more cheerful after that. But Immerwahr sings those lines and the almost uplifting chorus (""I want you to need me/ Not to feed me"") with a gentle grace, fleshed out by guitarist John Engle's simple, spacious chords, and Brokaw's equally open drumming. They didn't change their sound much across their three official releases: <i>Frigid Stars</i> was the most surprising because it was the first, and when the six-song <i>Barely Real</i> EP emerged a couple of years later, it felt masterful in its compression of what we'd come to expect from them. By the time they got to <i>The White Birch</i>, their most Slint-like moment, they were adding a few more wrinkles, like bigger, more melodic guitars (as typified on the gigantic, nautical-themed opener ""Sea""), and Scharin could play even slower and heavier than Brokaw. But the music was just as focused on the original set of concerns.</p>
<p>The group was so good at paring down their music that a number of the bonuses that appear on these sets, while fun, serve mostly to show you that Immerwahr and co. included the right material on their records and had a good feel for the correct tempos and aesthetics. I liked hearing the almost black-metal feedback of the demo for <i>Frigid Stars</i>' ""Second Chance"" and the fuzzed-out, backward-guitar of the ""Cave-In"" demo (yes, the Boston band got their name from that one), but the originals are miles beyond these curiosities. That said, some non-album tracks call for repeat listens, like the gentle, warm ""Summer Dresses"", the B-side live staple ""Broken Hearted Wine"", and an acoustic take on ""Pea"", the final track on <i>Frigid Stars</i> as well as the B-side to a split with Bitch Magnet.</p>
<p>There are also covers: slow-core takes on Joy Division's ""Atmosphere"" and Unrest's ""Hydroplane"". Neither of these is surprsing; the group's interests and affliliations weren't difficult to track down.<i> Frigid Stars</i>' ""New Year's"" was co-written with Bitch Magnet's Sooyoung Park and later recorded with his gentler post-Bitch Magnet band, Seam. David Grubbs played the solo piano on ""W"", a track on <i>Barely Real</i>, and showed up again as a guitarist for <i>The White Birch</i>'s ""Tom"" and ""Wird"" (a reworking of the earlier ""W""). Bitch Magnet's Jon Fine added ""noisy guitar"" to <i>Barely Real</i>'s ""Jr."", and the EP ended with a cover of MX-80 Sound's ""Promise of Love"" (in 1992, I admittedly thought it was a Codeine original).

<p>As important as Codeine were to me personally, and as influential as they were on the scene at that time, and on bands after (Mogwai, Low), they're a group many don't seem to remember.

But there's something especially fascinating about how people rewrite or misremember history. When I see folks in their 20s writing about the music of the 90s, they often get the little things wrong, or are writing about one-person's interpretation as though that's how it was. It makes sense that the smaller details would slip through the cracks. And while I admit it's hard separating my personal history from Codeine, the group's output really does stand up; they were more important in the early 90s than most people realize today, and maybe that will change here. </p></div>"|16766.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16766-frigid-stars-barely-real-ep-the-white-birch/|8.8|Brandon Stosuy

Breakup records tend toward the the maudlin and the oversharey, a place to air out all that dark-night-of-the-soul stuff over a couple of heartbroken chords. It's a loose template, to be sure, but it's all a far cry from the eternally bemused Smith's perma-grin. For <i>Longtime Companion</i>, Smith and his Sunsets have upended their warm, worn-in oldies-nodding pop for an expansive, lightly psychedelic spin on 1970s country-rock, while whittling away much of the charmingly goofy eccentric uncle humor that peppered 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14069-tomorrow-is-alright/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tomorrow Is Alright</i></a> and last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15324-hit-after-hit/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hit After Hit</i></a>. But where most breakup albums aim directly for the rawest nerve, throughout <i>Longtime</i>, Smith keeps a characteristically cool head.</p>
<p>Smith's best songs often take the form of wily character studies or bizarro Vonnegutian inventions, like the murderous unguent at the heart of ""Death Cream"". Delving directly into affairs of the heart for <i>Longtime Companion</i> is quite a leap for the often one-step-removed Smith, and it's one he gamely sidesteps. Whether it's the (slightly randy) zoological metaphors of ""Year of the Cock"" or the ""funny kind of sad joy"" expressed amidst the blank shuffle of ""I See the Void"", Smith seems to be keeping most of the hows and whys to himself, dodging confession with emotional fence-sitting and silly stuff about roosters.</p>
<p>Oh, sure, there are at least a couple of clues as to what happened: His ex-baby's a divorcee, and Smith's the one who made her that way, and when they see each other around town, he's going to pretend that they're still together. But the more pointed stuff is outmatched by a well-worn, broadly drawn malaise that, in this age of Harvey Levin, doesn't give much away. This is where <i>Longtime</i> gets frustrating; a <i>Blood on the Tracks</i>-style bile-spew might be asking too much from a laidback character like Smith, but he's leaving more out of provocatively titled songs like ""Dried Blood"" or ""My Mind Messed Up"" than he's keeping in, holding the listener at just enough distance to make it easy to sympathize but next to impossible to truly relate.</p>
<p>Still, taken as a set of would-be sad-sack standards, <i>Longtime</i> perks up considerably. The record's sound is warm and lush; with its gorgeous swaths of flute and halo-encircled backup vocals, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13507-pretend-you-love-me/"" target=""_blank"">""Pretend You Love Me""</a>-- having first appeared in tauter form on last year's <i>Hit</i>-- is the kind of song you want to float around in for a while. The Sunsets are, as ever, a subtly dazzling musical unit, and there's nary a wasted note throughout <i>Longtime</i>'s half hour and change. And, though Smith's cool demeanor and apparent aversion to letting it all hang out keep <i>Longtime Companion</i> from feeling particularly personal, it just makes the few moments where his voice breaks all the more affecting. The record's easygoing pace, sturdy songwriting, and sunbaked production make it the third solid effort from the Sunsets. Still, it's the least of the three, retreating from Smith's stellar story-songs for an album that seems somewhat reluctant to tell its own tale.</p></div>"|16753.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16753-longtime-companion/|6.5|Paul Thompson

For the first four tracks, the technically sophisticated band extends a blitz of intensity, with drummer Mario Duplantier sending up rapid, precise salvos from behind the field-marshal bark of his brother Joseph. But during the 108-second ""The Wild Healer"", Mario slows to a steady snare-and-cymbal trot, the guitars circling overhead in two repetitive riffs. They just sit there, too, letting the guitars squeal a bit more and the distorted bass swell through the mix.</p>
<p>Of course, this is just an interlude, as ""Planned Obsolescence"" rips through the relative silence with the same ferocity as the record's front end. But the pause offers perhaps the most revealing moment on <i>L'Enfant Sauvage</i>, an album that earns the rank of Gojira's best work to date not only because the Duplantier brothers are Meshuggah descendants with a head for melody, but also because it's so well paced. Go back through those first four tracks: Opener ""Explosia"" appropriately explodes from its haunches and then roars, with Joseph beginning the album-length story about a person's slow fight against self-depravity like he's shouting loud enough to purge the process from himself. But then the seven-minute track eases into a blur of guitars and mid-tempo march, Joseph's growl now enhanced by the hints of a hook. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13534-lenfant-sauvage/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>, which follows, builds tension for half of its length by extending one riff, stopping it, and playing it again; just when the tease starts to get tedious, though, Gojira finally spring forward into the kind of violently controlled breakdown that reminds you what a circle pit is for. It's exhilarating because it is so expertly timed. Still, after a minute or two of that melee, the quartet buries itself with a sudden fade, as if they've disappeared into the mouth of an abyss. As a whole, <i>L'Enfant Sauvage</i> is exhausting. But taken bit by bit, it's awesome. </p>
<p>Gojira take most of their twists and turns within songs-- that is, the bulk of <i>L'Enfant Sauvage</i> churns and sprints and charges, with tangents taking shape within the songs rather than dictating them. Though ""Pain Is a Master"", for instance, opens with a moody mix of field recordings and forlorn acoustic guitar, it rights itself with rigid force soon enough. Aside from a late-song onslaught, ""Born in Winter"" is Gojira's attempt at a ballad, with Duplantier doing his best solemn grunge moan above a rapid guitar line that serves more as a canvas than a progression. Even amid the heaviest bits, Duplantier sings like he's staring at an arena of lit lighters, letting the glow of this narrative drift toward its end. In that way, Gojira recalls Baroness, a band that uses a much different strain of heaviness toward the same end. As Gojira do with their feverish wizardry, Baroness play to their mid-tempo strength only to then play against it constantly, breaking the pace (and concomitant expectations) with tangents that strengthen the record's general rigors. For <i>L'Enfant Sauvage</i>, that plan works just as well within individual songs as it does across the entire album.</p>
<p>This record revolves around struggling toward transcendence or, at the very least, working to avoid the mire of self-destruction. ""One day, we'll wake up from this absolute nonsense,"" Duplantier charges toward the end of ""Planned Obsolescence"", a pulverizing piece of thrash that seems to wink, at points, to bands like Shellac before shrieking toward the exit like grindcore on fire. ""Conscience awakened, we'll take it from there."" A decade into their career, that's a fitting moral for the story of Gojira, a band that's occasionally stumbled (2008's less-than-stellar <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12452-the-way-of-all-flesh/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Way of All Flesh</i></a>) after great success (2005's deserved breakthrough, <i>From Mars to Sirius</i>) to arrive at one of the most riveting and challenging metal records of the year. This quartet's nothing if not an adroit and agile rock band, prone to acrobatic guitar lines and rhythmic shifts capable of inducing whiplash. For these 52 browbeating but not-quite-brutal minutes, they recognize that those moving parts aren't enough to make a great album. With that realization in mind, they've done exactly that. </p></div>"|16752.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16752-lenfant-sauvage/|8.1|Grayson Currin

Whoever he's talking to, it's not himself. Pollard, long prone to spiking even his most gloriously imperfect songs with out-there choruses, waves of static, and commercial prospect-shattering titles like ""Game of Pricks"", is not our foremost expert in matters of the immaculate. January's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16131-lets-go-eat-the-factory/"" target=""_blank"">Let's Go Eat the Factory</a>,</i> the strange, spotty comeback album from GBV's ""classic era"" lineup, could've doubled down on Bob's back-bleacher arena-rockers or Tobin Sprout's tucked-in power-poppers, possibly earning them some new fans. But <i>Factory</i> wore its flaws proudly, sidestepping any and all easy ""hey, we're back!"" triumphalism and overeager ""look how we've grown!"" progressivism for a show-up-and-plug-in casualness that couldn't have come from any other GBV. So it goes with <i>Class Clown Spots a UFO</i>, their second LP on the year. <i>Class Clown </i>is shorter, punchier, and a lot livelier than <i>Factory</i>, but impeccable? Nothing doing there.</p>
<p>Tobin Sprout's age-defying voice and surplus of solid songs helped his return to the fold on <i>Factory</i> seem especially triumphant. This time around, it's Bob's show all the way. <i>Class Clown</i>'s title track, a resurrected gem plucked from the outtakes collections <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13681-suitcase-3-up-we-go-now/"" target=""_blank""><i>Suitcase 3</i></a>, deserves to stand as the resurrected GBV's new rallying cry. It's one of those dizzyingly catchy Pollard songs that seems to sew two or three viable hooks together, its criss-crossing chorus the product of some serious craftsmanship on Pollard's part. Next to <i>Factory</i>, his rockers are leaner and less fraught, while his ballads are more straightforward and more plainly gorgeous. Still, beyond ""Class Clown"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13300-keep-it-in-motion/"" target=""_blank"">""Keep It In Motion""</a>, Pollard seems the looser dude here, providing <i>Class Clown</i> with nearly all of its gnarlier rockers and oddball overtures.</p>
<p>Though Pollard is warmed up, Sprout's a bit stiffer. Long the classicist of the pair, Sprout's stately pop songs, at their best, play off Pollard's woolier mammoths in a way that does both sides favors. Here, though, his songs are too tame, seeming beamed in from another record. The especially bland ""Starfire"" finds Toby singing ""worlds are falling down like raindrops"" over an uninspired, starched-shirt string arrangement. The stripped-bare, minute-long ""Lost in Space"" is a good showcase for his striking voice, but it feels like a retread of <i>Factory</i>'s similarly spare, Sprout-sung blip ""Who Invented the Sun"". Sprout's never been the font his buddy Pollard is, but after gracing <i>Factory</i> with some striking shiners, this pace of output seems to be stretching his songbook a bit thin.</p>
<p><i>Factory</i> might've nailed that rickety old GBV feel, but the songs often seemed secondary to the sound. On <i>Class Clown</i>, a window's opened in <i>Factory</i>'s dank back-basement and the songs make their way closer to the light. The production's brighter, the melodies more generous, and the songs themselves more fully formed. Still, as on <i>Factory</i>, pains have been taken to approximate the oversaturated, unpredictable feel of the classic-era LPs; writhing highlight ""Tyson's High School"" lets one of the set's best hooks-- standing ""Be True to Your School"" on its head-- ooze out of a psych-jam sludge, ""Blue Babbleships Bay"" goofily thrashes for 90 seconds before pulling the plug on itself, and ""Worm w/ 7 Broken Hearts"" ends quickly enough you'll wonder whether they actually got around to the ""7 Broken Hearts"" bit. This stuff gives the eclectic, at-all-angles <i>Class Clown</i> at least a spot of cohesion. But at times, the only thing holding the album together is its constant forward motion. A bit more of the title track's immediacy couldn't hurt matters; the best of the rest are growers, and they make you work for them. They've been peppering their recent sets with tunes from the new LPs, but as much as there is to like about the sputtering ""Roll of the Dice"" or the flat-out stunning ""Chain to the Moon"", they haven't earned the right to bump ""Choking Tara"" off the setlist just yet.</p>
<p>Being a Guided by Voices fan means adjusting your expectations for what makes a good record; when even <i>Bee Thousand</i> has its ""Kicker of Elves"", there's always the threat that things could get silly or stilted. Guided by Voices' 2012 output feels especially volatile in this way; <i>Class Clown</i> is full of left-turns and detours, willing to spike some of its better hooks simply to keep things interesting. Upon their return, a lesser band might've jettisoned the mess and noise of those classic records, leaving little but pure pop. But GBV Mark II have thus far proven way too ornery for that, and despite an uptick in catchiness, <i>Class Clown</i>'s odd-angled pop and jittery arena rock keeps the weirdness on par with its predecessor. Granted, the sneakily tuneful <i>Class Clown</i> is still a few miles from impeccable. But that's what makes it a Guided by Voices album.</p></div>"|16740.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16740-class-clown-spots-a-ufo/|7.0|Paul Thompson

Linguists from Long Island University published a paper that examined 18-to-25-year-old women's use of uptalk (which is when you talk? like this?), the word ""like"" as filler, and a phenomenon known as vocal fry, which they rather long-windedly defined as ""a form of phonation, characterized by a distinct laryngeal vibratory pattern,"" but, like, you know what they <i>meannnnnn</i>. The easy assumption is that anyone (especially over 18) who talks like this is stupid, artless, and possibly related to a Kardashian, but linguists now conclude just the opposite: ""A lot of these really flamboyant things you hear... girls are using them to achieve some kind of interactional and stylistic end."" </p>
<p>Of course, you already knew that if you've turned on a radio in the past few years. Nicki Minaj is the poet laureate of vocal fry, and her verse on Britney Spears' ""Till the World Ends"" remix is a master class in mining this effect for laughs: ""Sniff, sniff, criiiiiiiiies/ I done staged your whole entire fucking liiiiiiife."" This aspect of Minaj's flow both embraces and exaggerates the way that young women allegedly talk to each other, and pushes it until it feels artificial, absurd, and even a little bit uncomfortable. When she says, ""It's Britney, biiiiiiiiitch,"" she holds the vowel so long you want to take a breath for her.</p>
<p>In the most practical sense, the rapid internet fame (a video nearing 400,000 views, a mention in <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/12/arts/music/when-imitation-isnt-the-sincerest-form-of-flattery.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The New York Times</i></a>, a <a href=""http://www.highsnobiety.com/2012/06/11/mark-mcnairy-springsummer-2013-lookbook-featuring-danny-brown-kitty-pryde/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">style shoot</a> with Danny Brown) of 19-year-old Florida rapper/Claire's Boutique associate Kitty Pryde owes something to the rapper that she's <span class=""s1"">called</span> <a href=""http://popdust.com/2012/05/11/kitty-pryde-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""the queen of [her] heart.""</a> ""I was hanging out with my friends and we were listening to Nicki Minaj,"" Kitty says of the first time she tried rapping, ""And every time we would listen to [""Roger That""], we would just go over the song and do different lyrics."" But while her talent is much slighter and less adroitly theatrical than Minaj's, Kitty similarly embraces girl culture while slyly, smartly caricaturing it. Like all of her boldest lines, the chatter that opens her micro-hit <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SDYus7iKC8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""okay cupid""</a> may seem either perfect or cloyingly inevitable: ""Get outta my rooooom.""</p>
<p>That story from <i>The New York Times</i> (excuse me, <a href=""https://twitter.com/kttydothedishes/status/200977800260362240"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span class=""s1"">the <i>Fucking New York Times</i></span></a>) is relevant to the questions that were asked when Kitty's self-recorded demos (""Justin Bieber"", <i>The Lizzie McGuire Experience</i>) first blipped the radar a few months ago. Because of her voice and presentation, people wondered: Is she a precocious 14-year-old or a market-tested, Carly Rae Jepsen-esque 26-year old? Is she totally awful or kind of great? Is she actually in on the joke? <i>haha i'm sorry</i> may not put these questions to bed, but to act like Kitty Pryde is guileless is to miss the wryness and self-awareness that's crucial to her music and persona. </p>
<p>Her creaky-voiced flow is a perfect stylistic match for the banal, crush-struck things she raps about, as it dances on the smeared line between boredom and Ambien tripping; which is not to say that it's style-less, but that the substance is <i>in</i> the style. Still, unlike her idol Minaj's <i>Beam Me Up Scotty </i>(or her other idol Danny Brown's <i>XXX</i>), the five-track <i>haha i'm sorry</i> isn't the sort of scene-storming mixtape that hints at a wide-open future. But it's not artless enough to write off as a meme, either. Instead it's something between those two extremes: the sound of somebody working deliberately within the context of her humble limitations. As of-the-moment as Kitty Pryde feels, she's someone internet culture has been acquainted with since the early days of MySpace photography: the girl who knows her best angles.</p>
<p>Each of them is on display on the Beautiful Lou-produced ""okay cupid"", her best and most fully realized song by a mall-parking-lot mile. Nevermind the Bud Lite Lime in her hand in the video or the references to Adderall; the sharp irony and crafty confidence of Kitty's lines comes from the fact that she's the sober one, the knowing observer. ""Call me sober when you're ready,"" she tells the serial drunk-dialer who's stolen her heart, but she's got one up on him because she's able to express the way he makes her feel: ""I'm not familiar with this type of devotion/ I used to be a pimp without emotion/ And now you've got me simpin and singing the Frank Ocean."" At its fleeting best, Kitty's music captures something human and disarmingly honest about longing in the hyper-connected disconnect of the digital world. Her back-and-forth with rapper Dankte on ""ay shawty: THE SHREKONING!!!"" starts out like a note passed to a crush during class, but it's later revealed to be something more complicated: an e-mail exchange with somebody smitten with her internet persona but who she's afraid to meet IRL, lest the spell be broken. ""Forget that you never met me,"" she mutters, ""I bet that when you do you will regret wanting to be next to me.""</p>
<p>Still, <i>haha i'm sorry</i> shows a problematically narrow range despite the fact that it's only 12-and-a-half minutes long. Certain repeated details (the Adderall dependency, the chew-toy squeaks on ""orion's belt"", the giggly jokes about scabies) feel more like placeholders than idiosyncrasies meant to add texture to her persona. The self-proclaimed ""rap game pest"" is well-versed in the art of trolling, as she indicates on her fuck-the-haters anthem, ""smiledog.jpg"". But despite its surface charms, that track exposes her biggest problem: Kitty Pryde too often coasts on the assumption that it's the simple fact of her presence that's garnered all the attention and hand-wringing surrounding her, not the far more threatening fact that she might actually be a decent rapper. ""You say this little white girl is ruining hip-hop/ I say damn right and take a lick of the ring pop/ And smile,"" she drawls, but the track feels like a missed opportunity to do something more than just show up and grin. </p>
<p>When she most effectively mines her self-deprecation, the tone of <i>haha i'm sorry</i> recalls not so much her cloud rap contemporaries as it does early-era Anticon, specifically Why?'s 2003 debut <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8670-oaklandazulasylum/"" target=""_blank""><i>Oaklandazulasylum</i></a>, a twitchy, patched-together record that found a young Yoni Wolf confronting similar issues with his own cred (""I always wanted to be the voice of the streets/ But my father was a rabbi and my mother made beats/ I mean, books/ And the kids from the streets always gave me dirty looks."") But for every moment that suggests she could be the next Yoni, there's another (""I am very YouTube-able"") that suggests she might be the next Tay Zonday; for every impulse that suggests <i>haha i'm sorry</i> could be a calling card, there's a gut feeling that it'll age like a glass of milk left out on the counter. But it's not as if Kitty, who'd totally roll her eyes at the word count of this review, cares either way. Is Kitty Pryde The Hottest New Rapper of 2012, some think piece has probably already asked and prematurely answered. But it speaks volumes about her knowing, self-deprecating appeal that if she heard that question she'd probably be the first to say exactly what you're thinking: <i>yeah riiiiiight</i>. </p></div>"|16894.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16894-haha-im-sorry-ep/|6.0|Lindsay Zoladz

When Oxford-based pop-infused house producer Orlando Higginbottom uploaded some rough demos to MySpace back in the pre-Soundcloud days of 2007, he attributed them to the rather ridiculous-sounding moniker of <a href=""http://totallyenormousextinctdinosaurs.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs</a>. His reasoning, as he told former Pitchfork contributor Philip Sherburne over at <i>SPIN</i>, was that he was looking for a name that ""couldn't be cool, couldn't be put into some kind of scene that gets hip for six months and then falls out of fashion."" Many discerning listeners still put plenty of stock into what artists call themselves, but in an age of music culture that favors layers of extra-musical imagery (or lack thereof) as key to an artist's narrative, such nomenclatural recklessness as Higginbottom's actually comes across as fairly brilliant.</p>
<p>The deeper joke: Despite the goofy name and Higginbottom's preferred costuming (huge feathered wings, huge feathered headdresses, stegosaurus spines, headgear that resembles glued-together mosquito nets), TEED's proper debut LP, <i>Trouble</i>, isn't incredibly showy. That much is obvious as soon as Higginbottom's voice drifts into his self-programmed rhythmic fray. If we're talking about octaves, he's got range-- his ability to slip into a soft falsetto is something that other mid-level electro-pop crooners should work hard to emulate-- but overall, he sounds shy and reserved vocally, in a way not totally dissimilar to fellow multitasking countryman Kwes. <i>Trouble</i> is Higginbottom's Polydor debut, but he's previously released music on Greco-Roman, the reliable label run by Hot Chip's Joe Goddard (who himself turned in an astounding remix of early single ""Garden""). The connection makes sense, since TEED's approach to dance-pop, much like Goddard's main act, sounds especially everyguy. The project's live show provides plenty of evidence that the stuff pleases crowds, but you get the feeling that he's doing this for himself more than anyone else.</p>
<p>While Hot Chip's lyrical focus has turned toward a beatific and universal mindset, Higginbottom's subject matter is more introverted. Mostly he sings about girls-- about how they don't pay him much mind and about how much mind he pays them, with a few heart-on-sleeve pleas for mutual appreciation sprinkled throughout. <i>Trouble</i>'s production is top-notch, with some sweaty club heartstoppers (the bouncing bass of ""Solo"", ""Your Love""'s euphoric vocal-house vibes), but Higginbottom's work never really sounds sexy, precisely because he's not trying to make it so. Even though his guise has appeared on a Crosstown Rebels single, TEED ditches the sultry vibes of his contemporaries and embraces his inner nerd. ""Household Goods"" is an on-your-knees beg for attention directed toward someone preoccupied with someone else, but when all's said and done, Orlando's fairly noncommittal about the whole thing: ""Give me a shot/ 'Cause I could be the dog to your bone/ Or something."" On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13667-stronger/"" target=""_blank"">""Stronger""</a>, he delivers devotionally, ""The feel I love in you is making me stronger,"" the kind of accidental play on words that spills out when you're keyed up on whatever's available-- or, when you're making hay out of a loveless situation by trying to siphon euphoria from future heartbreak.</p>
<p>Those sensitive, vaguely bookish tendencies definitely lend <i>Trouble</i> a distinctly indie pop appeal-- a Junior Boys for the sexually frustrated, perhaps, a comparison that builds steam when noticing the comparability between Higginbottom's vocals and those of Junior Boys' Jeremy Greenspan circa <i>Last Exit</i>. But anyone with a pocket-protector-protected heart knows that even nerds have wandering minds. Besides slightly overdoing it on track-by-track rhythmic similarities and sounds shaded with warm reds and blacks, <i>Trouble</i> is a hair or two too long, which makes it all the more ironic that some of its strongest moments take place when its creator is content to let his short hair down and escape to the comforts of his own mind. The vocal-skipping echoes of ""Closer"" move at their own pace, while ""Shimmer"" seems less concerned with a conclusion than finding a way to stick its head further into the clouds, as Higginbottom wistfully exhales, ""If you mean it, if you mean it, if you really do/ Right on."" The exclamation comes across more like a sigh, but feeling good often feels bad, too.</p></div>"|16719.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16719-trouble/|7.3|Larry Fitzmaurice

It's also a graceful, surprisingly catchy one. It's a complex, knotty collection that speaks to the members' hard-won confidence in each other and what they do together. In some ways it's reminiscent of labelmates Harvey Milk's ""late-period"" LPs, 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12005-lifethe-best-game-in-town/"" target=""_blank""><i>Life… The Best Game in Town</i></a> and 2010's masterclass in minimalism <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14240-a-small-turn-of-human-kindness/"" target=""_blank""><i>A Small Turn of Human Kindness</i></a>. Each is an exercise in patience and actual heaviness as well as an example of a group not afraid to blend genres and styles in a way that doesn't feel choppy or random. When a group's personality is strong enough, variations are pulled into an overall aesthetic that makes sense even when it goes way way out. You don't see the stitches.</p>
<p>Though, on average, younger than the guys in Harvey Milk, Old Man Gloom are also made up of dudes starting to find gray in their beards. (Unlike Harvey Milk, they could still use some Ritalin.) You might be tempted to call OMG a ""super group,"" but that's a ridiculous term in 2012, especially in the context of underground music. Instead, think of the band as longtime friends who happen to be members of other groups, because that's what lifers do. Co-founders Aaron Turner (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2122-isis/"" target=""_blank"">Isis</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26804-mamiffer/"" target=""_blank"">Mamiffer</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30256-split-cranium/"" target=""_blank"">Split Cranium</a>) and Santos Montano handle vocals/guitars and drums, respectively. They're joined by Caleb Scofield (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/709-cave-in/"" target=""_blank"">Cave In</a>, Zozobra) on bass and Nate Newton (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/823-converge/"" target=""_blank"">Converge</a>, Doomriders) on guitar. Everyone screams or adds clean or distorted vocals, and there's also no shortage of electronics, pedals, unnamed noisemakers, and other ""instruments"" (sheet metal, toilets, shoes).</p>
<p><i>NO</i> is OMG's fifth album, the first in eight years. Fitting for such a long gestation, we're told it's ""the cumulative response to a lifetime of saying 'yes,' when just the opposite should have been said instead."" <i>NO</i> wasn't guided by an album cycle, and these guys are very busy with their other projects. It's something, one might suppose, that they just wanted to do. In that sense, and others, OMG feel more like a collective than the usual touring band (though tour they do). Their ""clarion call for those who are no longer willing to say yes to that which corrodes life, mind, heart, and soul,"" is individualistic, fucked up, and unrelentingly apocalyptic while remaining life-affirming. <i></i></p>
<p><i>NO</i> opens with two minutes of cavernous, drafty bass thumping and drone as part of a song called ""Grand Inversion"", a track that melds static, high-pitched white noise, and piped synthesizer into a kind of anti-introduction. The first proper song, the eight-minute <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13673-common-species/"">""Common Species""</a>, feels like a more typical sludge anthem until it degrades into shards of feedback and howling that eventually morphs into clusters of a gentler, sparkling clatter. It's a bit like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"" target=""_blank"">Christian Fennesz</a> (and then <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3554-steve-reich/"" target=""_blank"">Steve Reich</a>) having his way with <i>Metal Machine Music</i>. The implosion bleeds into ""Regain/Rejoin"", a track led by Aaron Turner's gruff shouts and a catchy guitar part that that grows increasingly anthemic as the song around it dissolves.</p>
<p>I kept thinking about broken glass when first listening to <i>NO</i>, and the effect is a bit like a house of mirrors. You never get a straight-up song, or one that follows an expected trajectory. But you do get some of the best hooks associated with any of these guys since the last Converge album. There's ""To Carry the Flame"" with its choir of angry dudes (and zany electro squiggles). The explosive ""The Forking Path"", fronted by Scofield, locates a whiplash industrial S&amp;M pace before unloading into soothing backward guitars and chimes. Then there's the extremely minimal ""Shadowed Hand"", eight minutes of low-level drone, feedback, and resonant western-tinged guitar strings that feels like recent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"" target=""_blank"">Earth</a> stripped to its barest core until the dynamic piano surges and almost-goth explosions at the six-minute mark. At that point, they located another anthem before the boom and hiss (and AmRep sound) of ""Rats"", ""Crescent""'s bizarro haunted acoustic meandering (reminiscent of a twangy Neurosis side project), and ""Shuddering Earth"", a 14-minute closer that cycles through all of the styles that came before it and then folds in a few other approaches. </p>
<p>I can see people being turned off by <i>NO</i>'s duration-- nine songs in just over 56 minutes-- and the more-is-more kitchen-sink approach to composition. But excess and overload are a couple of OMG's assets. This is not simple music, and the band doesn't make it easy for itself or the listener. Considering that experimentation, though, and the overall sound and vibe, it does goes down relatively easy thanks to the smart sequencing and smarter songwriting. This is an experienced group, four guys who've been at it for a long time, and who know when to tip the scales in this or that way to repel you and then pull you back: The ""old man"" in their moniker is increasingly fitting, and it suits them.</p></div>"|16748.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16748-no/|7.2|Brandon Stosuy

If that categorization suggests some militant maul of lockstep rhythms and churning leads, two factors push Ides of Gemini apart from those expected molds. First, Timms' cathedral-sized air arrives just in time for the return of Dead Can Dance, its darkly seraphim tone cast wide with a gentle reverb haze. She softens the role of doom-metal bandleader, doling out lyrics about dishonor, mortality, and pain with a well-developed sense of what sounds pretty. And just as she's a different sort of singer than you might expect from a nominal power trio, she and Johnston shape a rhythm section that's exactly that-- functional for the meter, but little more. On the trio's debut, <i>Constantinople</i>, her bass playing sits squarely in the middle, sometimes barely perceptible save for the liner notes' credits; for her part, Johnston drums with a garage-like rumble, keeping the beat but rarely building around it. Ides of Gemini, then, subverts the general prowess triangle of this music-- an academy-ready vocalist fronting a passable young rock band.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The configuration fosters both intrigue and disappointment on the nine-track <i>Constantinople</i>. Timms' singing alone makes it a necessary listen; her control is extraordinary, capable of low dips and high drives in a single phrase and harmonies that ooze across the track. On ""Resurrectionists"", she employs a sense of timing and dynamic that suggests Beach House's Victoria Legrand slinking through the verses, and connecting with the chorus. ""Resurrectionists"" also showcases one of the trio's most compelling musical crutches: All three players suddenly thin their parts, so that the bass, guitar, voices, and drums synchronize in sudden stops and starts. When they turn the same trick midway through ""The Vessel &amp; the Stake"", it's electrifying, like the trademark clatter of ""Iron Man"" suited in finer clothing. Their lurches and launches during ""Reaping Golden"" are captivating, too, triumphantly pushing and pulling against the theme. </p>
<p>But throughout <i>Constantinople</i>, it's possible to imagine what these songs might sound like with a full band at their backs, or, at the very least, an outfit that would split the intricacy with Timms' voice. There are holes in these tunes, obvious places where a more capable ensemble might have built something better or more immersive. Johnston's simplicity behind the kit is the kind of thing that the band's biography graciously dubs ""martial."" This music doesn't lend itself to drumming that's neither sophisticated nor subtle. Hints of black metal, sludge, and even classic British wizardry generally succumb to the notion that this trio isn't up to the task, a problem that erases the kind of stylistic frisson that could add some much-needed tension to <i>Constantinople</i>. A longtime heavy-metal critic, Bennett is a fine and erudite guitarist. He tries to add something to Timms' complicated elegance, but his playing sometimes feels like an attempt to upstage her. All too often, it feels combative, as though his high placement in the mix were intended to prove that this band has more than one strength. Here, they really don't. Were Bennett's lines-- incisive riffs that are very familiar but certainly reinvigorated-- integrated into a full-band setting instead of serving as the lone point of interest aside from the vocals, they might feel less restless, demanding, or distracting. </p>
<p>On last year's debut EP,<i> The Disruption Writ</i>, Bennett and Timms tried the same approach on four of the songs found again on <i>Constantinople</i>. But that was self-recorded and self-released, while this LP was engineered by Chris Rakestraw and mastered by James Plotkin. A year ago, Timms didn't seem quite so commanding, meaning that she, Bennett, and their drum machine sat well together in the same lo-fi space. But the better she sounds, the less cohesive the band seems to get. Here, Bennett and Johnston seem lucky just to back her. Again, at least her lead alone is worth the price of attention.</p></div>"|16878.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16878-constantinople/|6.0|Grayson Currin

But <i>Oshin</i> isn't just a gorgeous and unusually melodic dream-pop record; it's an interesting experiment in whether a band based on voice/guitar/bass/drums can rely on the guitar to carry the song's meaning. DIIV's songs are built around verses and choruses but these are unusually fluid and intuitive, almost post-rock in miniature. And this album is more of a sensory experience than an emotional one. The original name of ""Dive"" was, according to leader Zachary Cole Smith, touring guitarist for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27968-beach-fossils/"" target=""_blank"">Beach Fossils</a>, a tribute to the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3046-nirvana/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana</a> song and/or an acknowledgment of how each member has a ""water"" astrological sign. The instrumental tracks that bisect the record are titled ""(Druun)"", perhaps a flubbed portmanteau of ""drone"" and ""drown."" But all three invented words  convey the elemental<i>. </i>Whereas someone like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2919-mount-eerie/"" target=""_blank"">Phil Elverum</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4783-wolves-in-the-throne-room/"" target=""_blank"">Wolves in the Throne Room</a> attempt to conjure nature's awesome unpredictability, DIIV capture the beauty and comfort of its foreseeable ebb and flow.</p>
<p>The pleasures of <i>Oshin</i> as a full-length are subtle. ""Past Lives"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13408-how-long-have-you-known/"" target=""_blank"">""How Long Have You Known""</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13541-doused/"" target=""_blank"">""Doused""</a> aren't just the most striking individual tracks; their smart spacing at the beginning, middle and end of <i>Oshin</i> has a trickle-down effect. Were ""Earthboy"" and ""Sometime"" to pop up on shuffle, not much about their rhythms or melodies would stand out. But within the album's context, they become sensible interludes. On a smaller scale, Smith's vocals are positively tidal, rising in confident and comforting intervals and resolving every bit as smoothly. The guitars bring to mind things like coins in a fountain, pebbles skipping across a lake, and small fish evoking silvery ink. Even the slowly overwhelming distortion of ""Wait"" incrementally seeps through the mix like a wave of cold, muddy sand, the only interruption the paradoxically arid ""Air Conditioning""-- the one track whose rigid, interlocking guitar patterns recall those of Beach Fossils.</p>
<p>The experience of <i>Oshin </i>is aqueous and amorphous in a way that makes using the term ""rock"" feel uncomfortable. The pliable yet sturdy intertwining of guitar and bass stretches across the songs like a hammock. And at its best, <i>Oshin </i>can feel like an ingenious distillation of the sonorous instrumental passages that took <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14288-disintegration-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Disintegration</i></a>'s ""Fascination Street"" and ""Pictures of You"" toward arena-rock grandeur. The album is mostly parceled out in lines of three-to-five descending notes that become self-descriptive adjectives: ""(Druun)"" wordlessly projects resolution, confidence; ""Past Lives"", wistful acceptance; ""Oshin (Subsume)"", a kind of dead-eyed stoicism; ""Doused"", white-knuckle tension. <i>Oshin </i>gives you hints and direction, but never tells you exactly how to feel. It reminds me that one of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young</a>'s most desolate and gripping records was called <i>On the Beach</i>.</p>
<p><i>Oshin </i>is notable for what it leaves to the imagination; not just about its own communicative aims, but about DIIV as well. Barely year ago, it was Smith's solo project, a fairly standard dream-pop act. The impact of DIIV's vibrant and muscular rhythm section makes all the difference. They might not <i>rock</i>, but <i>Oshin </i>always offers tactile resistance. And after the second ""(Druun)"", <i>Oshin </i>starts to coil into a darker pose, emerging from the deep with the tension of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2112-interpol/"" target=""_blank"">Interpol</a> before turning post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"" target=""_blank"">Fugazi</a> emo drunk on reverb. </p>
<p>""Doused"" ends abruptly before the closing lullaby ""Home"", giving the impression that if DIIV recorded any further at this stage, they'd be too far off from where they started for <i>Oshin </i>to cohere as beautifully as it does. It's a snapshot and a potential pivot; DIIV appear to be at a place where bands like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9633-the-war-on-drugs/"" target=""_blank"">the War On Drugs</a> were after their debut full-lengths; similarly good albums which blurred instrumentals and songcraft, evocation and statement. Of course, their next ones were <i>great </i>largely because they made you care about the people who created them. DIIV have made a compelling debut where what the band is actually about is fairly unimportant. But since <i>Oshin </i>deftly defines what they <i>do</i>,<i> </i>and what they do <i>now,</i> this mystery is likely a temporary state.</p></div>"|16749.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16749-oshin/|8.3|Ian Cohen

The handful of young rappers with tread, most notably Chicago's Chief Keef or the recently returned-from-exile prince of Odd Future, Earl Sweatshirt, make music with pomp and bombast, as aggressive as it is catchy. But the kind of music Joey BadA$$ makes hasn't sounded contemporary since the mid-1990s, or around the time he was born.</p>
<p>Today, Joey is the most visible member of a young artist collective called <a href=""http://theproera.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Progressive Era</a> (Pro Era for short), a crew mostly comprised of students from Brooklyn's Edward R. Murrow High School. These kids take musical inspiration from a time before any of them existed, specifically, the era referred to by hip-hop purists of a certain age as the ""Golden Age."" That time period, however, was dead if not fully decomposed by 1999, the year of this tape's title. While albums from 1999 like Mos Def's <i>Black on Both Sides</i> and MF Doom's <i>Operation Doomsday</i> offered potent alternatives that year to the power-balling of Jay-Z's <i>Vol. 3: Life and Times…</i> and the literal ""Bling Bling"" of BG's <i>Chopper City in the Ghetto</i>, rap about ""keeping it real"" was as rare a find as those upholding the practice. Joey Bada$$, however, is doing his best to further the period's legacy of boom-bap production as an authenticator and advanced-level lyricism as a meal ticket.</p>
<p>The young man clearly has an old soul. <i>1999</i> opens with ""Summer Knights"", an interlude produced by fellow Pro Era member Chuck Strangers, that with its shimmering keys, loop of gentle background singing, and words from Bada$$ decrying the lack of rap ""style wit no gimmicks,"" sounds like the direct spawn of Nas' ""Memory Lane"". ""Waves"", whose intro regarding the coveted hairstyle of young black men nationwide is the only reference to the song's title, continues in the same manner, with smooth jazz production and Bada$$ rapping, ""Like I told you, I know niggas who trash rapping/ Worried 'bout the tending fashions rather than ascendin' passion."" There's no chorus, but he drops a 2Pac soundbite about rap not being ready for a ""real person"" in the middle of two verses. Wack MCs get a break on ""FromDaTomb$"", but in the midst of ""resurrecting boom bap from the tombs,"" Bada$$ even refers to marijuana using the antiquated term ""buddha."" It's not enough to simply appreciate the sound: Bada$$ is wholly invested in the period.</p>
<p>For all his ""old New York"" posturing, though, he's a prodigious rapper, one who could have guested on a revered proving ground like the now defunct Stretch and Bobbito radio show, only to have his freestyle dubbed continuously from cassette to cassette. ""Suspect Niggaz"", the obligatory posse cut tacked on to the tape's end sounds like friends trying to impress each other, a lunch-table cipher put to record. Its chorus also happens to come from a song on Nas' <i>It Was Written</i>. Bada$$ himself treats every verse as an opportunity to best whomever you'd been listening to prior (his own group members in the case of ""Suspect""), a habit that could have been altogether exhausting for the listener if not for his ability to stay on topic. ""Niggas don't want war I'ma Martian wit a army of Spartans/ Sparring with a knife in a missile fight,"" he raps on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13765-survival-tactics-ft-capital-steez/"" target=""_blank"">""Survival Tactics""</a>, the song whose video first flung Bada$$ into the internet hype vortex.</p>
<p>Outside of production from his Pro Era crew, Bada$$ has repurposed beats for <i>1999</i> from MF Doom, Lord Finesse, and the late J Dilla. They play seamlessly among the newer productions, something Bada$$ was clearly invested in as Pro Era member Chuck Strangers recently revealed to Jayson Greene. ""I don't just sit around making boom-bap beats all day,"" the producer said. ""I make all kinds of beats-- this is the just first thing everyone's heard from me. But Joey had a very specific vision for <i>1999</i>.""</p>
<p>Though Bada$$ released the tape on Datpiff, he's managed to get the video for ""Hardknock"" into rotation on MTV2. So while it could be that he's keeping his label association under wraps for the sake of building a more organic fanbase, he does already have a well-connected management team in place. Regardless, Joey Bada$$ has succeeded at getting the attention he wants for the music he wants to be making. That in itself is a victory in any era.</p></div>"|16864.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16864-1999/|8.0|Felipe Delerme

The New Jersey-based DJ/producer who goes by <a href=""http://livinginthesafety.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Physical Therapy</a> is most often found inside sets of remix parentheses-- he's made his own versions of songs by artists from Alicia Keys and Lloyd to any number of his like-minded contemporaries. If the internet has replaced physical space as the birthplace of underground music scenes, this corner of the web is as thriving as any local town filled with young garage bands playing weekly basement shows. Fisher, along with a crew of acts like Minneapolis duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28875-elite-gymnastics/"" target=""_blank"">Elite Gymnastics</a> and seasoned R&amp;B nostaglic Tom Krell of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28769-how-to-dress-well/"" target=""_blank"">How to Dress Well</a>, work alongside one another in a sea of mixes, remixes, and reworks tied together by clever, internet-literate signifiers, retro-futuristic winks, and a music nerd's collection of obscure samples. They make slick websites that intentionally look like infomercials; they accidentally spawn savvy micro-genres. At times it can feel like just a topical grab bag of cool sounds and images. At other times it feels like an exciting portal into the future. </p>
<p><i>Safety Net</i> is Physical Therapy's first music released in a standard format. The EP is a solid attempt at corralling the sometimes-meandering themes-- early-90s rave, rare samples, luscious R&amp;B vocals, ambient percussive sounds-- into a tangible whole. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13623-record-sales/"" target=""_blank"">""Record Sales""</a> folds smooth jazz and echoey cooing and ahhhing into a cotton-candy dance party; ""Mind You"" wraps loops around walkie-talkie vocals from 1970s novelty song ""Convoy"". While there's no essential core to idea, the five tracks are slickly fun, pointing to Fisher's good taste and strength's as a DJ (he knows how to make people dance to weird shit in a live setting). The five-minute <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13777-drone-on-ft-jamie-krasner/"" target=""_blank"">""Drone On""</a>, for instance, underscores his ability to craft melody out of the miscellany. Simple synth lines, plastic-sounding keyboards, frantic drum'n'bass beats, and visual artist Jamie Krasner's featherlight guest vocals crystallize into something that sounds effortless and joyful. But not everything hits this hard: the EP's weakest track, ""Mind You"", plugs away without much to show for itself, aimless in its ambience.</p>
<p>For those of us who are drawn to the ideals of the culture and sounds of rave but too young to have experienced it in its original form, a song like <i>Safety Net</i>'s ""Do It Alone"" allows a sort of vicarious enjoyment retooled for a more fragmented digital-age sensibility. ""Do It Alone"" uses buzz and drone and an untraceable house vocal (""Oh girl, there's something about the way/ You give me freedom"") softly punctuated by tinny breakbeat but its title brings to mind lone people in rooms connected through their computers.</p>
<p>So if there's a thread to be pulled from a low-maintenance release like <i>Safety Net</i>, and from much of the music being made by Physical Therapy's contemporaries, it's the way the idea of ""rave"" and its revival has splintered in the last year or so. Whereas artists like Skrillex and Bassnectar have seized the physicality of the early-90s movement, making dubstep and electronic dance music that incites thousands of kids to thrash around in arenas or at festivals, underground producers are filtering old rave sounds and imagery through a contemporary, visual art-tuned lens and using them for more private listening experiences.</p></div>"|16795.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16795-safety-net-ep/|7.2|Carrie Battan

In doing so, they've helped shape the city's image as our era's clubbing capital. On the second of their <i>Modeselektion</i> compilations, though, they turn away from the dancefloor to a more inward journey. Where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14975-modeselektor-presents-modeselektion-vol-01/"" target=""_blank""><i>Modeselektion Vol. 01</i></a> was on a party tip, building bridges between Berlin techno and UK bass, <i>Modeselektion Vol. 02</i> is a group exercise in sound design.</p>
<p>Whether expressly advised or not, there is a definite sense of a theme. There are clues in the inclusions (Monolake, Prefuse 73, Clark, Mouse on Mars) and in the titles (Lazer Sword's ""Landscape"", Phon.o's ""Fukushima"", Addison Groove's ""Manic Miner""). Here are a set of tracks with a shared desire to build tangible spaces for absorbed exploration; static-laced landscapes navigable by echolocation. Rather than entice you to the dancefloor, they pull you forward, and in, with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>The ordering, it has to be said, is seamless: Each track traces elements of the one before and takes them somewhere new. But, as with most journeys, there is an inspired beginning, an eventual epiphany, and a lot of getting lost in the middle. The opening rumble of Egyptrixx's ""Levitate"" set the pace, and place: an eerily barren recess of the mind that nevertheless offers some strange comfort. From the beginning, it's clear this is an album made with headphones in mind. Don't even think about laptop speakers; all that labored-- and it often feels labored-- detail would be lost. Nor would a club space, with all those distracting bodies, afford the close listening this record desires. ""Levitate"" makes way for the vivid marshlands of Monolake's ""Hitting the Surface"", gunshots rippling out across the water. In Monolake's wake, it gets a little muddy, a little same-y, for a stretch, save for Mouse on Mars' Glasgow-influenced ""Humoslab"" and Sound Pellegrino Thermal Team's ""Activate"", which comes off like a big, wet kiss after all that sleepwalking. </p>
<p>That's the thing about this record: The inner-space exploration is enjoyable to a point, but it comes with an underlying claustrophobia and, at times, a weariness. With so much focus on the micro detail, the bigger picture's been neglected, and ultimately it feels a little tired. Despite fragments of the outside world, it presents a strangely insular scene: a vision of the world that's self-contained, self-content, and, now and then, self-indulgent. Most telling, Modeselektor's own contribution is a four-and-a-half minute growling beast culled from a 45-minute jam session. There's a sense here that the process was perhaps always going to be more satisfying for the creator than the listener.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there is some respite at the record's close courtesy of the rise and fall of Prefuse 73's buried, light-injecting melodies, Jan Driver's push-and-pull string odyssey, and Anstam's darkly ecstatic, chime-timed dream. The latter's title, ""Observing the Patterns"", would make a suitable subtitle to <i>Modeselektion Vol. 02</i>, a collection of tracks orbiting an in-between land.</p></div>"|16754.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16754-modeselektion-vol-2/|6.0|Ruth Saxelby

No, it was for fuckin' ""Kokomo"". No doubt, the sight of 20- and 60-year-olds alike happily groovin' to the same escapist, bourgeoise-fantasy jingle would've mortified Lars Finberg; the thirtysomething brainstrust of <a href=""http://www.intheredrecords.com/pages/intelligence.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Intelligence</a> seems to hold boomers and Millennials with equal contempt, if only because both groups appear to be having more fun than him. Over the course of seven albums and countless sideline releases as the Intelligence, Finberg has couched his various complaints in cryptic, cheeky wordplay, and a fractious sound that hotwires the hormonal abandon of 1960s garage-rock to the intellectualized anarchy of post-punk and robotic spaziness of new wave. But his new album, <i>Everybody's Got It Easy But Me</i>, comes wrapped in such a self-explanatory mission statement, it might was well come with a <a href=""http://images.dvds-home.com/upload/uploadfiles/Larry_David_in_Curb_Your_Enthusiasm_Wallpaper_1_1024.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover photo of Larry David</a>.</p>
<p><i>Everybody's Got It Easy But Me</i> is at once the Intelligence's most lyrically direct and musically exploratory album to date, introducing pastoral psychedelia, space-age bachelor-pad vibes, and at least one proper ballad to the mix. Fittingly for a record that likes to pull you in two different directions at once, Finberg recorded it with two separate supporting casts in his hometown of Seattle and his new base of operations, Los Angeles, a city that tends to elicit extreme <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b5LzCOc98E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">love</a>/<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1tj2zJ2Wvg&amp;ob=av3n"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hate</a> reactions. Finberg, however, opens the album with the suitably blasé sentiment of ""I Like L.A."", on which he essentially plays the opening act to himself, itemizing his anxieties over a tinker-toy beat and grinding acoustic riff-- like something Graham Coxon might come up with in his bedroom when in a Wire-y mood-- before a patience-testing count up to 44 and a thoroughly unexcited announcement of ""ladies and gentlemen, the band"" introduces a full-group rock-out rendition. Of course, the Intelligence are hardly the first band to explore the fallacy of the California dream, but rather than deal in a trite <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdlEMmAFfIM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fallen-angel</a> narrative, ""I Like L.A."" keys in on the day-to-day monotony of artists struggling to make ends meet in the shadow of the entertainment-industrial complex; what it captures is the very despairing sound of countless nights spent playing for the bar staff and their friends.</p>
<p>But<i> Everybody's Got It Easy But Me</i> answers Finberg's ever-withering worldview with playful, rambunctious performances, enhancing the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyhU2mVyFAk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I-just-wasn't-made-for-these-times</a> pathos of his lyrics by essentially making him sound like an outcast within his own songs. On ""Hippy Provider"", he rolls his eyes at the sound of ""freedom rock"" even though his exuberant backing chorus of female singers seem eager to keep on chooglin'. ""Reading and Writing About Partying"", meanwhile, is a raucous rallying cry for frustrated concert-goers who can't enjoy their favorite band because everyone's holding up their goddamn cameraphones, and for those left aghast at how the think-for-yourself ethos of punk and first-wave indie rock has degenerated into a social-media hivemind.</p>
<p>If Finberg's crankiness starts to grate on the demented six-minute squeal ""Sunny Backyard"", <i>Everybody's Got It Easy But Me</i> also yields surprising moments of sweetness and delicacy: ""Little Town Flirt"" is a faithful cover of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQLQp8drUf4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the 1962 Del Shannon hit</a> that sees Finberg trading lines with another Shannon (Shaw, of Oakland garage outfit <a href=""http://shannonandtheclams.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shannon and the Clams</a>), while the downcast acoustic closer ""Fidelty"" sees a straight-faced Finberg dropping disarmingly candid confessions-- ""If you really scrape for the truth/ Every part of me has died""-- over a melody that echoes Pulp's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-MHoq9N2co"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Razzamatazz""</a>, before yielding to a teary chorus of harmonies straight outta <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDOL7iY8kfo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road""</a>. It's always been easy to smirk along to Finberg's lyrics and deadpan, detached delivery, but in its dying minutes, <i>Everybody's Got It Easy But Me</i> emphasizes a quality that often gets lost in the conversational crossfire: He's a professional cynic only because he cares. </p></div>"|16739.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16739-everybodys-got-it-easy-but-me/|7.5|Stuart Berman

Beyond blazing the trail for punk and the subgenres that arose in its wake, their songs have been <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOwdHFVu7lA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">covered by stadium-rock giants</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ4SLUO5O9o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">featured in videogames</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BswdLh9_TBE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">successfully mashed-up with Salt N Pepa</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZwwUSb3jZg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">soundtracked Kristen Stewart/Dakota Fanning make-out scenes in big-screen biopics</a>, and used <a href=""http://www.ronashetonfoundation.org/news/new-chrysler-300-commercial-featuring-john-varvatos/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">to sell Chryslers</a>. But it's no coincidence that all of these middlebrow appropriations draw from the band's 1969 self-titled debut and 1973's <i>Raw Power</i>-- by Stooges standards, the albums you're most likely to reach for when entertaining house guests.</p>
<p>The band's infamous 1970 sophomore release, <i>Fun House</i>, has remained largely undisturbed by the music supervisors of the world, because, as even casual Stooges fans know, you just don't fuck with <i>Fun House</i>. It isn't simply a collection of classic proto-punk songs, it's a very real, physical, suffocating space. It's an album in which you get locked and trapped, and from which you reemerge a different person. Over the course of its 36 minutes, Iggy Pop's temperament is gradually debased from the cocksure swagger of opener ""Down on the Street"" to the screaming, strait-jacketed psychosis of the closing ""L.A. Blues"". It's an album that even <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970:_The_Complete_Fun_House_Sessions"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one of the most absurdly over-the-top box sets in rock history</a> couldn't decode or demystify. </p>
<p>But if <i>Fun House</i> is like that creepy dilapidated domicile at the end of the street, the Ty Segall Band are the neighborhood punks who break into it late at night just for kicks, spray paint the walls, and leave behind a small mountain of empty beer cans. Now, the Ty Segall Band are not the Stooges; their full-throttle, pedal-squashing thrust makes no allowances for the Stooges' underrated sense of groove and funk, and Segall is way more of a sucker for pop melody than Iggy ever was. But <i>Slaughterhouse</i> sees them redrafting the <i>Fun House</i> floor plan for their own devious devices: there's that evocative title, for one, and the fact that both albums end with extended, free-form noise meltdowns (in Segall's case, the self-explanatory ""Fuzz War""). But most of all, they've vividly captured <i>Fun House</i>'s unapologetic griminess, blast-furnace heat, and panic attack-inducing lack of oxygen.</p>
<p><i>Slaughterhouse</i> is also the closest thing to a concept album we've heard from Segall, whose reputation has been built upon on a ceaseless stream of releases born of a hyperactive whimsy. And where the Lennon-like turns on 2011's Drag City debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15557-goodbye-bread/"" target=""_blank""><i>Goodbye Bread</i></a>, suggested Segall was following a similar pop-leaning path to garage-reared peers like Smith Westerns, Black Lips, and the late Jay Reatard, it was answered earlier this year by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16558-ty-segall-white-fence-hair/"" target=""_blank"">a wiggy, scatterbrained collaboration with psych-folkie White Fence</a>. But on <i>Slaughterhouse</i>, Segall's impulsiveness yields to a holistic aesthetic. Segall has described it as <a href=""http://exclaim.ca/News/ty_segall_comes_clean_about_fake_andrew_loog_oldham-penned_bio_eyes_evil_evil_space_rock_lp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""evil space rock""</a> in interviews, but <i>Slaughterhouse</i> feels more subterranean and animalistic than that descriptor suggests. This is an album that opens with a scorching double-shot of Motor City-burning rave-ups (""Death"" and ""I Bought My Eyes"") and a title track that recalls Nirvana with a serious case of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEUz9mDYm4g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tourette's</a>, and then just gets faster, heavier, and nastier as it progresses; even the withering mid-album sludgefeast ""Wave Goodbye"" eventually intensifies into a fiercely militaristic, machine-gunned finale. (Only a crazed, abruptly terminated cover of the Bo Diddley/Captain Beefheart standard ""Diddy Wah Diddy""-- which ends with Segall screaming ""fuck this fucking song!"" before admitting with a laugh, ""I don't know what we're doing!""-- breaks the album's sinister spell.)</p>
<p>Remarkably, <i>Slaughterhouse</i>'s extra heft doesn't come at the expense of Segall's melodic gifts and <i>Nuggets</i>-schooled economy. It's one thing to be heavy, and it's another thing to be hooky, but <i>Slaughterhouse</i> is the rare garage-rock album to do both so well simultaneously: the hopped-up harmonies of ""Tell Me What's Inside Your Heart"" sound like Hamburg-era Beatles on a particularly potent amphetamines binge, and even the sewer-soaked cover of the Fred Neil-via-The Fabs oldie ""That's the Bag I'm In"" can't obscure it's righteous chorus. But <i>Slaughterhouse</i>'s surprising bounty of crust-covered pop hooks doesn't so much temper the album's ferocious attack as adrenalize the Ty Segall Band's performances to lightning-fast, bloodletting extremes. Which makes the aforementioned ""Fuzz War"" the only logical way to bring the album's careening momentum to a halt. Comprising 10 minutes of ominous feedback drones and hailstorm drum rattles, the colossal closer proves to be less guitar-carnage climax than scorched-earth aftermath, an opportunity to tally up the body count and mop up the entrails. But while ""Fuzz War"" may be an uncharacteristic moment of excess on another otherwise lean and mean album, it reinforces the idea of <i>Slaughterhouse</i> as a real place to get lost in-- and the only way out is through the killing floor.</p></div>"|16744.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16744-slaughterhouse/|8.7|Stuart Berman

But three albums in, Ackermann is still learning his way around a pop song: Where 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13500-exploding-head/"" target=""_blank""><i>Exploding Head</i></a> found A Place to Bury Strangers becoming a little less shy about letting their melodies poke through the static, this year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16244-a-place-to-bury-strangers-onward-to-the-wall/"" target=""_blank""><i>Onwards to the Wall</i> </a>EP saw Ackermann reverting to a stern-faced, sunglasses-indoors emotional distance and taking sanctuary within the band's strobe-lit squall. The apparent backsliding again raises the question of whether there's something more to the band than just the most exquisitely sculpted feedback that <a href=""http://u2-stage-and-studio.com/edge/id83.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Edge's money can buy</a>.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-bidi-font-family: 'Lucida Grande'; color: black;"">The title of A Place to Bury Strangers' third album, <i>Worship</i>, is especially rich coming from a band that's never tried to mask its reverence for the alt-rock holy trinity of Joy Division, the Jesus and Mary Chain, and My Bloody Valentine; A Place to Bury Strangers songs are really differentiated only by which of those touchstones they choose to lean on more at any given moment. But while the aforementioned influences are all present and accounted for here, there's a textural richness and emotional depth to <i>Worship</i> that wasn't always apparent on the band's previous albums.</span></p>
<p>For a guy who effectively makes a living selling noise to other guitar players, Ackermann's rationing out his supply in more controlled quantities this time out, whether deploying sporadic electric shocks and brown-note frequencies to disrupt the hard-charging opener ""Alone"", or gradually easing off the introductory fuzz fanfare of ""Fear"" to reveal the song's mysterious, canyon-deep expanse. But while A Place to Bury Strangers take the brave step of allowing the distortion to dissipate, the unfettered view isn't always flattering: Ackermann's lyrics can sound like they were torn out of a bored, trench-coated high-school kid's notebook, with the cyber-punk fantasia of ""Mind Control"" and I-want-to-die miserablism of ""Why I Can't Cry Anymore"" verging on goth parody. (I'd also add the one-note aggression of ""Revenge"" to that list, but it's salvaged by an awesome <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beo-kLitPMg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""You Made Me Realise""</a>-style breakdown/blast-off that will no doubt gash many a head in concert.)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Hopefully, <i>Worship</i> will prove to be a transitory album, because its best songs feel like the work of another band entirely: ""Dissolved"" begins as a glistening, atmospheric ballad that suddenly shifts partway into a brisk, early-Cure backbeat, with Ackermann picking out an untreated, beautifully melancholic melody on his guitar, while the forlorn, post-breakup lament ""And I'm Up"" follows that lead further to showcase Ackermann's most verbose, frank, and heart-rending lyric sheet to date. For a few minutes there, A Place to Bury Strangers feel less like <a href=""http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/rftmusic/2008/08/show_concert_review_setlist_photos_nine_inch_nails_st_louis_august_20_2008_missouri_scottrade_center.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a no-brainer choice to open a Nine Inch Nails arena tour</a>, and more like a band spiritually in tune with the intimate indie pop of Wild Nothing and the like. And suddenly, it becomes a lot easier to imagine a future where A Place to Bury Strangers are known less for their effects pedals than the affect they peddle. </p></div>"|16750.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16750-worship/|6.5|Stuart Berman

It's sit-down music by any measure, but casual wine-and-cheese conversation doesn't suit it quite like sitting in a darkened room to the accompaniment of some motion-picture visuals-- an experience that amplifies the music's actual purpose instead of letting it aimlessly float around in the background. This has long been the relationship between music paired with film-- Bernard Herrmann's soundtrack for <i>Vertigo</i> and Jerry Goldsmith's <i>Alien</i> weren't made to accompany early-morning jogs, and they'll make your dinner party more unnerving than is necessary, but when bodies are falling and monsters are stalking they sound absolutely peerless. Not every score can be a <i>Shaft</i>-style pop-music crossover that works just as well outside the theater.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1468-man-with-a-movie-camera/"" target=""_blank""><i>Man With a Movie Camera</i></a>, which was made to score the 1929 Dziga Vertov <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iey9YIbra2U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">documentary of the same name</a>, has stood for the better part of a decade as the Cinematic Orchestra's most prominent effort to reconcile that visual-underscore orchestration, with their blend of string-section jazz informed by another corner of cinema-- think <i>Taxi Driver</i> and <i>Chinatown</i>, to re-invoke Herrmann and Goldsmith. But the acid-jazz influence that characterized their other high-profile moments, whether stark and spare (""To Build a Home"") or sweepingly lavish (""All That You Give""), takes a backseat to classical compositions on <i>In Motion #1</i>. And while it's the most cinematic and orchestral record with their name on it, it's also not entirely a Cinematic Orchestra album, either-- note the little fine-print ""presents"" on the cover-- as they've outsourced a few ideas to composers who are more deeply rooted in chamber music and modern classical.</p>
<p>The seven songs on <i>In Motion #1</i> were commissioned as alternate scores to seven short avant-garde films, and without those inspirations unspooling in front of the listener, there's a strange incompleteness to most of them. Of the three Cinematic Orchestra tracks, only ""Necrology"" feels like something that can stand on its own two feet; glassy piano melodies burble warmly over a tricky-signature drum barrage, and the theme rides out through subtle shifts that keep the dynamic from going flat. The other two cuts run long and fall short. The 20-plus-minute ""Entr'acte"" aims for a jarring contrast between bucolic pleasantness and waves of impending doom, but it evokes nothing more stirring than a vaguely artsy commercial for wireless gadgets or German performance sedans, and its build into a flimsily ""epic"" rock-drum coda is too little and too late to feel like the culmination of anything. The swooning uplift of ""Manhatta"" sounds like it could be from any blandly inspirational period piece about a never-say-die racehorse or an ambitious industrialist with a crazy dream.</p>
<p>The other contributors run through their own variations, all slow-paced and subtle and pushing nine minutes or more. Austin Peralta's dreamlike piano-and-strings ""Lapis"" is the most immediately beautiful of the pieces; Grey Reverend's acoustic guitar-driven ""Regen"" has some fine <i>Astral Weeks</i> interplay with the string section here and there; and the two tracks by Tom Chant and Dorian Concept, ""Outer Space"" and ""Dream Work"", lace raw-nerve suspenseful movements with piercing saxophone solos that jump out like suddenly scattering birds. Yet there's still something naggingly missing in these pieces, as if you're only catching one side of a potentially fascinating conversation.</p>
<p>But all the films those songs score are readily available on YouTube-- so hit the mute button on the video, cue up the corresponding piece on <i>In Motion #1</i>, and things all fall into place. ""Outer Space"" and ""Dream Work"" are both based around<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTarJ0Op7W8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> two films by Peter Tscherkassky</a> that turn clips of the 1982 horror b-movie <i>The Entity</i> into gristle-speckled, high-contrast black-and-white studies in decay, and the juxtapositions with the seizure-warning footage really draw out the menace in Chant and Concept's work. James Whitney's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzniaKxMr2g"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Lapis</i></a> and its meditative, hypnotic, abstract psychedelic animation was originally soundtracked by 66-chic sitars, but Peralta's piece is a good way to draw out the film's more nuanced movements-- and the music's trippier elements. The continuous downward crowd-shot pan of Standish Lawder's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dadi7mw5gCs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Necrology</i></a> finds the ideal accompaniment in the similar slow-motion descent of the Cinematic Orchestra's composition, ""Manhatta"" feels a lot less treacly and a lot more stirring when set to Paul Strand's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGAt0ic52gc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">silent document of New York City in 1921</a>, and the rainfall study of Joris Ivens' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPD2C0K38jY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Regen</i></a> is a stirring inspiration for Grey Reverend's light-fingered guitar. The only piece that stumbles in juxtaposition with its inspiration is ""Entr'acte"", which tries to replace Erik Satie's lively, slyly comedic score to René Clair's Dadaist ballet intermission short with music too conventionally dramatic and stuffily dignified to fit the surrealist slapstick. But you could always save that one for dinner parties-- the rest do well being listened to with your eyes.</p></div>"|16845.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16845-in-motion-1/|6.0|Nate Patrin

The title of their newest archival release, <i>The Thought Adjusters</i>, isn't quite as poetic, but it might be their most apt. Though the Family and their leader, Father Yod, espoused a spiritual, philosophical, and ethical lifestyle-- leading some to brand them a cult-- they don't appear to have had any interest in brainwashing. They're more drawn toward adjustments in thinking, through a questioning of assumptions that values loose improvisation over rigid rules.</p>
<p>At least that's true of the music the various Source Family groups made, and <i>The Thought Adjusters, </i>culled from the vaults of family member Isis Aquarian, delivers tons of that on-the-spot inspiration. Take ""The Goddess Earth (All My Sons Are Jesus)"", which Yod opens with a meandering rant about the Earth as a human being entering puberty, God as a father with many sons, and predictions of natural disasters ""in 1987…the latter part of '86…or the beginning of '88."" It all comes in a stream of consciousness that's less like preaching than searching. Think <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28898-daniel-higgs/"">Daniel Higgs</a> in <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14256-say-god/"">Say God</a></i> mode, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3979-sun-city-girls/"">Sun City Girls'</a> Alan Bishop when he morphs into rambling street-poet <a href=""http://youtu.be/S2ybu0iTGKg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Uncle Jim</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps thought adjustment is what Yod and the Family wanted to do themselves rather than to you. In fact, if you haven't encountered any Source music before, <i>The Thought Adjusters</i> will more likely rework your ideas of long psych freakouts than your notions of spirituality. On the surface, the Source groups were hippie jam bands, but they rarely indulged in long solos, ornate arrangements, or flowery emotions. They were more a garage band with no off switch, prone to stretching their simple riffs out into the stratosphere (there are only seven tracks on these four LP sides). Whenever they could veer into a complicated turn, they instead stick to their guns, building variety from momentum rather than flash. In the process, they predict the elastic inspiration of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>'s workouts on the <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16733-the-lost-tapes/"">Lost Tapes</a> </i>box, as well as the acid-soaked trips of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/521-butthole-surfers/"">Butthole Surfers</a>.</p>
<p>Still, the center of the <i>The Thought Adjusters </i>is Father Yod, and his oddly malleable singing is the star of each song. His voice stretches and cracks and distorts, hitting on a gut level rather than a pitch-perfect one. His lopsided cries inject energy into the longer songs, but I'm partial to one of the shortest and sparsest tracks, ""Seed of Yahowha"". Here, Yod has an almost rap-like sense of timing, mimicking and counterpointing some wiry, Beefheart-esque guitar. He might never actually hit a note-- it's all charm and charisma, and when you hear it, you can understand why it led many a Source family member down Yod's winding path.</p></div>"|16820.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16820-the-thought-adjusters/|7.3|Marc Masters

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Fitting that <i>Red Night</i> sounds like such a throwback to an economic boom time, as these songs give off a strong whiff of luxury problems, the sense of being unfulfilled while having most of your basic needs fulfilled. It feels like a part of the Hundred in the Hands' DNA: Eleanore Everdell's vocals do convey a certain elegantly wasted sex appeal, adopting pretty much every accepted permutation on ""breathy"" or ""chanteuse."" But these songs seem to take place in a vacuum or a mirror, lacking any kind of romantic victim or victor. Likewise, Jason Friedman's programming is slick, gleaming, and sanitized-- sounds that trigger the agreeable idea of paying downtown rents, without having to consider the grit, bustle, or danger that goes along with it. Put together, most of <i>Red Night</i> inevitably rings insular and vaguely dissatisfied. There's nothing wrong with most of the songs here, they just hint at a desire to be ambitious without much of an idea of how to go about it. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">""Empty Stations"" is a full-scale demonstration of that: there's the anticipatory, minute-long lacuna to begin <i>Red Night</i>, a walloping volume boost on the chorus and the sort of jungle-referencing drum break that's been cropping up in recent productions by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28875-elite-gymnastics/"" target=""_blank"">Elite Gymnastics</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1311-el-p/"" target=""_blank"">El-P</a>. It does a tremendous job of looking the part of the gauntlet-throwing opener. ""Recognise"" similarly has some intriguing elements in place: a gnarled, desert blues riff, a loping stumble that matches Everdell's laconic intonations. The stretched-out choral vocals of ""SF Summer"" and ""Stay the Night"" generate some narcotic allure as well. But these songs always feel as if they're striving for something spiritually, if not physically-- a chorus that leaves an imprint, a lyric of real emotional payload, a truly novel texture. Unsure of its ability to communicate, most of the lyrics appear to acknowledge its own void as a natural state of being (""Your voice like white noise""). Everdell's lyrics have an almost enzymatic effect, incomplete and suggestive conveyances of the most basic emotions-- ""falling in love,"" ""this is love,"" on the title track and ""Stay the Night"", respectively. But they're being delivered in a suggestive, post-coital moan, leaving such sentiments sounding confused or even negated-- like an actor getting the wrong read on their script.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The messages are at their most mixed on ""Come With Me"", where a big power-chord riff references the diamond-selling lacquer Mutt Lange put on tracks like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10886-def-leppard/"" target=""_blank"">Def Leppard</a>'s ""Photograph"", but just sounds like a cheap laminate. Everdell is subjected to a silo's worth of bouncing reverb, completely incongruous with a composition where everything else screams for extroversion. It's the one throwback to the harder-edged electro-rock that defined <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14670-the-hundred-in-the-hands/"" target=""_blank"">their self-titled 2010 debut</a>, which had something of an element of surprise-- Richard X and Chris Zane produced and the Hundred in the Hands siphoned enough NYC post-punk allure to get a couple of Siouxsie Sioux and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6468-karen-o/"" target=""_blank"">Karen O</a> comparisons to boot. But taking into account their shift into the murkier, heavy-lidded realm of electro-pop, is the red of the night meant to convey the glare of the seedy after-hour neon, or coming to at 4 a.m. looking at your alarm clock? Too much of <i>Red Night's</i> bleary somnambulance assumes the latter, with overproduced but underwritten pieces that seek to create atmosphere but mostly leave empty spaces that the Hundred in the Hands aren't sure how to fill. Both Everdell's melodies and vocals often just trail off into ping-pong echo as hollowed-out beats trudge barely awake at the wheel.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">You're left wondering if Hundred in the Hands are even excited about <i>Red Night</i>. We always like to think of art as being a result of epiphany, of brainstorm, of divine inspiration, but listening to <i>Red Night</i>, I just can't envision bolts of inspiration captured on cocktail napkins, late nights in the studio sculpting that perfect chorus melody. Which isn't to say <i>Red Night</i> is an artistic non-entity: These songs just feel like constructs that help you think about art in a big picture where the Hundred in the Hands themselves just don't seem all that essential.</p>

It did momentarily distract from the scruffy loner archetype of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10709-for-emma-forever-ago/"" target=""_blank"">For Emma, Forever Ago</a>, </i>but the enormous size of the band he assembled to tour it led to new jokes about how alone he <i>wasn't</i>. </p>
<p>From the jump, it's clear that the group's just-released <i>iTunes Session </i>isn't meant as a substitute for that live experience. It's an EP, for one thing, and the in-studio format downplays invention. And it begins not with the explosive fanfare of ""Perth"", the song that opens <i>Bon Iver </i>and its attendant live shows but rather the closer, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46901-listen-to-bethrest-from-bon-ivers-itunes-session/"" target=""_blank"">""Beth/Rest""</a>. It's a curious bit of sequencing until you realize it's actually the song that makes the best case for this particular format. This version puts more emphasis on ""power"" than ""ballad"": Vernon is a distinct singer and what comes across in <i>Session</i>'s ""Beth/Rest"" is that he's a strong, gritty one as well. It's an underutilized look for him. The backbeat becomes equally resolute and steady as well, the percussion hitting with purpose rather than wafting like some box kites being knocked about in the wind. It frees the song from being a battleground for opinions about Bruce Hornsby. And it is the highlight. </p>
<p>As for the rest of the set, well, this is something like how <i>Bon Iver </i>might have come across with a more traditional approach to production. These aren't exact copies of what appeared on <i>Bon Iver</i><i>, </i>but they're about as close as you can get. Just witness ""Michicant"": those seemingly tossed-off scuffs of reverbed guitars at the beginning are recreated verbatim and yes, someone remembered to bring the bicycle bell.  ""Minnesota, WI"" makes its dropped-octave harmonies stand out a bit more in this setting, but its tricky polyrhythms are otherwise impressively intact. ""Hinnom, TX."" and ""Wash."" sound professional as opposed to magical. But there's value in that, too, as the clarity allows the interlocking layers of keys, brass, and percussion to reveal themselves and prove above all else, <i>Bon Iver </i>was the creation of many very, very sophisticated musicians. But didn't you already know that? </p>
<p>There's no continuity here, no rarities outside of a lone cover, and nothing similar to the World Café performance of ""Beth/Rest"", which fundamentally altered the song into a barroom lurker in a way that justified its existence. Though ""Holocene"" appears in typically fine form, <i>Bon Iver</i>'s most immediate crowd pleasers-- ""Perth"" and first single ""Calgary""-- are excised in favor of its impressionist deep cuts in a setting that doesn't take advantage of their amorphous structures.</p>
<p>The EP ends with a spirited cover of Björk's ""Who Is It?"", where Vernon and the band whip around the tracks's hairpin turns enthusiastically, breathlessly. Coming at the end of six hyper-accurate selections from <i>Bon Iver</i>, whether ""Who Is It?"" does the original justice feels like the wrong question to ask. Justin Vernon is often a very funny, self-deprecating man who makes incredibly serious records, so it's mostly disappointing that <i>iTunes Session </i>doesn't take more chances. Which leads back to the same question that's met every <i>iTunes Session </i>thus far: ""Who exactly is this for?""</p>
<p>If it's looking to capitalize on post-Grammy curiosity, it's a lazy sampler. All of Bon Iver's studio recordings can be considered essential for him as an artist and almost certainly for indie rock as a whole (particularly ""Skinny Love"" and ""Woods""), and there’s not a single track from <i>For Emma, Forever Ago </i>or <i>Blood Bank EP </i>here. It doesn't even make sense for the penny-pinching Bon Iver fan: once again, it's not meant to be confused with <i>Bon Iver: Live! </i>and only a few dollars separates having what is essentially half of <i>Bon Iver </i>and owning the entire thing as it's meant to be heard. I suppose if Bon Iver's not coming to your town any time soon, and you were hella bummed out by his ""SNL"" performance, it might be worth the cost to know he can ""pull it off"" with capable aplomb. Beyond that, it's basically 60% of one of the decade's finest records, so it's more subject to triggering buyer's remorse than critical naysaying. <i>iTunes Session </i>isn't exactly useless-- it turned in decent surveys of bands like Wilco and the Decemberists, whose catalogs are sprawling and erratic.  But this one is mostly a consumer curiosity. </p></div>"|16863.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16863-itunes-session/|6.9|Ian Cohen

Don't all bands make the music they want to make? Isn't that a-- if not <i>the</i>-- purpose of being in a band, to produce the sound you want to hear in the world? To an extent, sure it is, but most acts operate within clear aesthetic parameters, stylistic constructs that give them direction, classification, and a targetable market. </p>
<p class=""p1"">But aside from several broad qualifiers, very little unites the works of Russ Waterhouse and Lea Cho, either in their previous electronic entropy act Watersports or pan-everything pairing <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/bluescontrol"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blues Control</a>. Their albums are instrumental, yes, and generally mix Cho's erudite piano playing with Waterhouse's bleary-eyed multi-instrumental tendencies on guitar, synthesizer, and tapes. They are also psychedelic in their non-linear, textural escapes. Still, across four albums and several splits and singles, Waterhouse and Cho have waded into various and manifestly disconnected deeps. Their self-titled debut volleyed from astral sweep (""Migration"") and gurgled beats (""Hummum"") to the distorted stoner grind of closer ""No Sweat"". Their third and most insistent record, 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13272-local-flavor/"" target=""_blank""><i>Local Flavor</i></a>, opened with a cut that nearly made good on the ""blues"" claim of their name, boogie-woogie piano bouncing around triumphant guitar vamps. It ended, however, with ""On Through the Night"", a 17-minute stretch that wound its way through webs of noise, church-organ glow, harmonica howl, and beats that broke open into the noisy infinite. </p>
<p>The close of <i>Local Flavor</i> certainly didn't presage <i>Valley Tangents</i>, then, Blues Control's fourth album, first for Drag City and first since escaping New York for Lehigh Valley, Penn. Instead, this opens with real drums courtesy of indefatigable percussionist Tatsuya Nakatani, who digs deep into a Latin groove for the start of ""Love's a Rondo"". Suggesting Vince Guaraldi leading an acid-jazz workshop, the tune bounces on springs, Cho dancing above Nakatani's groove with nimble variations. Around it all, Waterhouse applies a generously kaleidoscopic sound-- pastel synthesizers and neon guitar, saturating the scene with weird light. Especially for a pair of musicians who emerged from a crowd and moment known more for sonic intrigue than technical skills, the playing here is astonishing. Cho and Waterhouse parallel and counter each other's themes in the last 90 seconds as though they were the Dead operating on a strict timetable. </p>
<p>That upped technical ante seems to be the true unifier of <i>Valley Tangents</i>, an album that gleans from prog, noise, baroque, hip-hop and more at will. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13531-iron-pigs/"" target=""_blank"">""Iron Pigs""</a> trusses the ruptures of 80s hip-hop rippers Death Comet Crew to the swivel of Neu! and a sense of playfulness that such references often preclude. ""Walking Robin"" decorates a simple melody and rhythm with complicated accompaniment; low-end rumble that sends the theme the other way, harpsichord splashes that tweak the time, a guitar solo that swallows itself. If that's an overload of signifiers, that's how Blues Control's music still sometimes seems-- restless to a fault, more aware of making a point about post-modern music than making that music itself stick. ""Love's a Rando"" manages to push past that, as does the blissed-out reverie of ""Opium Den/Fade to Blue"". At its weakest points, Blues Control becomes the sort of bust band that's interesting to hear once and ponder, rather than simply set to repeat.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's why the album's quietest and most reserved moment, ""Open Air"", is also its most intriguing, both as a six-minute listen and as a suggestion of Blue Control's growth outside of New York's din. Over heavy tape hiss, Cho's fingers drift along her piano, hints of a restrained Chopin étude eventually tumbling forward into the emphatic streams of notes and stops that Keith Jarrett made his solo trademark. Waterhouse creeps in, tucking his synthesizer glow between the piano's patter and the recording's hiss. He eventually adds bass (chiseled phrases, like Jaco on a dimmer) and the slightest tickle of percussion. If you're waiting for Blues Control to get strange here, keep waiting: ""Open Air"" sighs into silence after six minutes, suggesting that Waterhouse and Cho now know that they don't need to be outlandish or aggressively inclusive to be interesting. And that, more than anything, seems to be the kind of music Blues Control are bound, determined, and once again able to make. </p></div>"|16734.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16734-valley-tangents/|7.0|Grayson Currin

It's popular for good reason: The phrase ""Echo Lake"" just <i>sounds</i> like a nice place to live (or make a record in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27672-woods/"" target=""_blank"">Woods</a>' case). Such assumed pleasantries also work towards the favor of this British group, since each individual word inhabits a lot of characteristics some people want out of indie rock as well: reverberant, liquid, tranquil, immersive. So you can't accuse <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28988-echo-lake/"" target=""_blank"">Echo Lake</a> of false advertising-- their debut, <i>Wild Peace</i>, is pure, dreamy indie rock laced with the more narcotic strains of shoegaze and untouched by modernity, with vocals and guitars awash in natural echo and keyboards that you wouldn't dare call ""synths.""</p>
<p>Echo Lake's laconic demeanor would have you initially believe <i>Wild Peace </i>isn't a bold record, but it does exude confidence in its own way. You don't have to be extroverted to be sure of yourself and Echo Lake is a band that trusts their influences and considers Slumberland a home rather than a stepping stone. Their language is sonically and lyrically commonplace, and the titles of ""Monday 5AM"", ""In Dreams"", and ""Swimmers"" are tellingly similar to those of songs previously written by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/777-the-clientele/"" target=""_blank"">the Clientele</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28353-wild-nothing/"" target=""_blank"">Wild Nothing</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a>. That's really the realm in which <i>Wild Peace </i>operates-- there's a distinct delicacy to this reclusive music that forgoes superficial thrill for subtle absorption, almost unerringly making for a passive listening experience. Tempos roll leisurely, percussion is used as much for texture as timekeeping, shakers and floor toms share equal billing with snares and hi-hats. Chords change by the bar, not by the beat and the melodies are only slightly more agile; vocalist Linda Jarvis is often lost in a thicket of her own overdubbed harmonies.</p>
<p>That's not to say <i>Wild Peace </i>is formless: ""Another Day"" finds a perfectly chipper vocal within a four-note range that perfectly pairs with Thom Hill's tart guitar riff and rides it out for the song's entirety. There's enough internal activity during ""Even the Blind"" to create a full-band dynamism over a melody that's basically one note moving as if suspended in a light gelatin. You could argue for its having the most dynamic buildup or the most striking harmonies because it does, but it's more likely the immediate standout simply because it hammers home its chorus the most times. </p>
<p>With that in mind, you might think <i>Wild Peace </i>would benefit more from the visceral than the ethereal, yet it starts to distinguish itself from its long-established template when the band gets <i>less </i>edgy. The rockers are too rigid, too indebted to the aspects of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4048-spacemen-3/"" target=""_blank"">Spacemen 3</a> that are out of reach: The fuzzed-out roar of ""Young Silence"" and ""In Dreams""' krautrock pulse feel like a band completing prerequisites rather than discovering themselves. More intriguing is the aching, almost oriental harmonizer applied to the guitars of instrumental ""Monday 5AM"", a mid-album dip into the heavy waters of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"" target=""_blank"">Grouper</a>. The nearly beatless ""Further Down"" and the title track achieve a similarly naturalistic, sun-staring psychedelia, ashen distortion and organ drone flittering about like visual floaters. But that's the thing about a record on which so many of the arresting sounds are borne of decay: Once you leave <i>Wild Peace</i>, it's pretty much gone.</p>
<p>If you don't get what you want out of Echo Lake, perhaps they didn't have what you were looking for in the first place.<i> </i>And it's tough to discern how much of it is actually the fault of the band itself-- even if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1673-galaxie-500/"" target=""_blank"">Galaxie 500</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4105-slowdive/"" target=""_blank"">Slowdive</a> would've been wholly out of step with what's going on right now, the strength of ""Fourth of July"" or ""Machine Gun"" would inevitably come to the fore. Or, does <i>Wild Peace </i>fail to achieve greatness because it doesn't aspire to that? Whatever the case, it certainly calls into question what really matters on a debut. While Echo Lake's relative lack of ambition doesn't make <i>Wild Peace</i> a failure, achieving such modest goals doesn't necessary make it a success either.</p></div>"|16746.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16746-wild-peace/|6.4|Ian Cohen

Dearly beloved within their native land and largely unknown beyond its borders, Portugal's finest purveyors of textured, atmospheric doom have returned with their third full-length. <i>Fæmin</i> is their first proper album since 2009's excellent <i>Erosion</i>, and comes courtesy of a partnership between Portugal's Bleak Recordings and Swiss label Division Records. Though they've come out with eight releases over their decade of existence and formed during the height of the post-metal Cult of Neur-Isis boom, the band have yet to truly surface on the global metal scene's radar-- until now. <i>Fæmin</i> is poised to be their breakout album and, as such, has a lot riding on its 40-some minutes. Five songs populate the record (with ""Harvest""'s six-and-a-half minutes clocking in as the shortest effort), and flow together nearly seamlessly, giving <i>Fæmin</i> an aura of continuity that suits its largely mid-tempo, repetitive riffage.</p>
<p>Process of Guilt fall reluctantly into the ""post-metal"" camp, but are far too rough-edged and industrialized to get lost amongst the reverb pedals and Aaron Turner clones languishing therein. Their sound is a heady mixture of Godflesh and Neurosis at their most pointed; the songs are long but focused. The atmosphere stays dark, and oppressive, and punishing. Think slices of Godflesh's <i>Streetcleaner</i> filtered through an army of effects pedals, or Brooklyn mechanized doom collective Batillus covering Neurosis' ""Through Silver and Blood"". Post-metal as an entity always seemed a bit mechanical, what with its emphasis on effects and loops and feedback drones; Process of Guilt ramp up that inhuman influence with cyclical heaviness, a forceful mid-tempo stomp verging upon industrial. A pronounced hardcore influence rears its head in Hugo Santos' hoarse, authoritative vocals, which manifest themselves as a harsh, monotone bark and surface only when necessary.</p>
<p>There is no fat to be trimmed here, despite the sprawling lengths of some of the compositions. Each song bleeds out into the next, offering up their own individual quirks but toeing the party line overall. The album's opening track, ""Empire"", manages to encapsulate everything they offer in almost 10 minutes of looped, mid-tempo guitar lines, throbbing bass, melancholy melodic underpinnings, and sparse, hostile roars (""You own nothing/ You are nothing""), entreating their audience to look inside themselves, and conquer what is theirs. Paranoia and hopelessness surface repeatedly, sentiments echoed by the music's urgent, bleak vibes. This is not a happy record; it's angry, and sad, and worried. Its sparing moments of beauty (like the oddly gentle breakdown and clean lament halfway through ""Blindfold"", or gossamer melodies in ""Cleanse"") are offset by the sheer crushing relentlessness that are Process of Guilt's bread and butter. </p>
<p><i>Fæmin</i>'s strength lies in its strangeness, its marriage of industrial sensibilities, doomed prophecies, and forbidding ambiance. There's just not much else out there that sounds like this. The band's ability to take a formulaic core and build it up to such impressive heights is a commendable achievement unto itself. They also, impressively, manage to imbue the album with a true sense of personality: In the end, Process of Guilt's earnestness is as endearing as their brutal approach is beguiling.</p></div>"|16736.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16736-fmin/|7.0|Kim Kelly

Despite the precedent set by the two <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16051-chinoiseries-pt-2/"" target=""_blank""><i>Chinoiseries</i></a> volumes that straddled his 2010 breakthrough, the big pull of <i>Long Distance</i> was an instantly gratifying sound that demanded to be elaborated on. His beats reassembled fractured vintage synth funk and R&amp;B tropes, glossy state-of-the-art in '87 tightness into a new stutter-step looseness, like machines rebuilt with duct tape and wire hangers. If that approach recalled a lot of oft-cited predecessors and peers-- imagine making a case for a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2248-j-dilla/"" target=""_blank"">Dilla</a>-evoking beat-creator at that style's most overwhelming saturation point-- it at least did so favorably, and in a way that focused on a distinct space of his own.</p>
<p>So is the next step to make that space more distinct, or just larger? The five-song <i>Deep in the Night</i> EP doesn't really answer that, which could be frustrating depending on how demanding you are of a 16.5-minute EP to represent forward motion instead of a mere supplement. Onra's gotten some enduring mileage out of these roller-rink throwbacks, owing equally to a keen ear for sources and a crafty idea of how to manipulate them. From a reverse-engineering perspective it can be fun to get at where he's going with his sample alteration, like how <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13655-love/"" target=""_blank"">""L.O.V.E.""</a> slows Slave's '84 jam ""Share Your (L.O.V.E.)"" down to a first-gear residential neighborhood crawl and flips that percolating synthesizer burble in on itself over a door-kicking 4/4 kick-clap. But even when ""Somewhere (Deep in the Night)"" and ""Hold Tight"" embody everything great about this sound of Onra's, they pull right at the same pleasure centers in the same ways that ""Send Me Your Love"" and ""Sitting Back"" did: digital chimes rattle from the gusts caused by helicopter-blade keyboards, drum machines are manhandled into something more off-the-cuff and improvisational. Vocal hooks get reduced to the three or four notes that hit the hardest before getting split apart or cut off, appealing in the same ways as ""Send Me Your Love"" and ""Sitting Back"" are.</p>
<p><i>Deep in the Night</i> fits <i>Long Distance</i>'s approach closely enough that you could append this EP to the end of that album, maintain that Michael Mann-directs-Soul Train feel, and still squeeze it all in the traditional 80-minutes-or-less CD length. It might help ward off suspicions of over-familiarity to pretend that some of the stylistic echoes are actually thematic callbacks instead of just redundancies. ""After Hours"" is a mid-tempo boogie-funk pastiche featuring a lover-man verse from Slum Village's T3, coming across like a breathless rebound to his break-up lament on ""The One"". And the beat-head romance of ""V.B.B.""-- Amalia actually answers Jay Kin's call for ""old-school love"" with the promise of ""record-diggin' 'til the morning""-- is like the personification of every obsessive lifestyle-music synthesis that made <i>Long Distance</i> sound like the work of a collector turned creator. <i>Deep in the Night</i> just shows the early signs of a pressing need to dig a bit deeper.</p></div>"|16822.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16822-deep-in-the-night-ep/|6.7|Nate Patrin

For all the received ideas about songwriting and performance that had been booted aside in the previous 15 years, almost nobody had seriously interrogated the way rock recordings sounded. The understanding was that you were supposed to reproduce, as closely as possible, what a performance in the same room would have sounded like. Then a string of bands started deliberately doing recording ""wrong,"" or at least asking to what, exactly, ""fidelity"" in music was supposed to be. Nobody did it wronger-on-purpose than <a href=""http://www.silverjews.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Silver Jews</a>, whose first two EPs-- 1992's <i>Dime Map of the Reef</i> and 1993's <i>The Arizona Record</i>--were pile-ups of cheap cassette wobble and flaws, song fragments, sloppy jams, and flubbed notes, with something cracked but wonderfully original radiating from within them.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The rumor, in 1992, was that this ridiculously named band was actually Pavement under a pseudonym. <i>Dime Map of the Reef</i> came out about a month after <i>Slanted and Enchanted</i>, on the label that had put out some of Pavement's earlier records, and one of the voices on it clearly belonged to one of the Pavement guys; it was obvious! (Fine, laugh. We didn't have Google back then.) Silver Jews weren't Pavement, but for a while the two bands shared singer/guitarist Stephen Malkmus and drummer Bob Nastanovich, and Pavement's early repertoire included <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRvd_KHsXk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Secret Knowledge of Backroads""</a> and ""West S"", both of which appear here. (Malkmus has even <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVmQh2doy9k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">played the latter solo</a>.)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It became evident with time that Silver Jews were very much singer/guitarist David Berman's band. They had the same progenitor as Pavement (University of Virginia band Ectoslavia), and a pretty similar knack for knotty riffs; both bands had obviously listened to the Fall a lot at an impressionable age. But Berman maybe cared a little less about tunes than Malkmus, and a little more about language. He, in fact, was the one who had come up with the phrase ""slanted and enchanted.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>Dime Map</i> is more a thrown-down gauntlet than a collection of songs, opening with a fake tourist jingle for Canada and continuing for a packed 7"" single's worth of recordings that refuse to behave. ""The Unchained Melody""-- no relation to that <i>other</i> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrK5u5W8afc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Unchained Melody""</a>-- rambles through an extended introduction, and cheekily fades out in the middle of its first verse. Berman begins ""The Walnut Falcon"" with a dramatic image of two rams clashing on a mountain, then immediately undercuts its seriousness: ""The horns go thwop/ The horns go thwop/ And I'm looking for my snowy bed.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The nine tracks that made up <i>The Arizona Record</i> are more satisfying on their own: The sides of its original vinyl incarnation opened with the two skewed, compelling songs that the Jews shared with Pavement. It's also got a couple of fragmentary songlets-- ""Jackson Nightz"" cuts from a crappy recording of a promising riff to an <i>even crappier</i> cassette recording of the same, then back to the original version, mid-lyric, and fades out on a snatch of Malkmusian falsetto. But it ends with a piece that actually seems finished, the meditative instrumental guitar trio ""Bar Scene from Star Wars"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>The Arizona Record</i> and <i>Dime Map</i> are all we get here, although it'd have been nice if this set included the band's other early recordings, including a side of a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZpdTVcTO4A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">split single</a> credited to ""Silver Jews &amp; Nico."" Still, the early Silver Jews' whole aesthetic was built on enforced incompleteness-- suggesting that something amazing had happened on the nights they recorded in Bob Nastanovich's living room, and that they'd just barely managed to catch enough of it on the fly to imply its glory, like a fragment of a Sappho poem. As the Fall <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb_pNmrT0r8"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">put it</a>: ""What really went on there? We only have this excerpt."" </p></div>"|16743.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16743-early-times/|7.1|Douglas Wolk

But redundancy and tedium are never far away from a nearly decade-old band churning out rewrites of the hits. <i>The National Health</i> is not immune to those ills, but it does prove that there's still <i>some</i> water left in that well, even if they're scraping the bottom.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Maxïmo Park have always been best at their fastest, when they sprint through verses into choruses and back out again just as quickly. That's thanks mostly to singer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7164-paul-smith/"">Paul Smith</a>, who has a unique ability to slip into controlled mania like a jockey cracking a whip. That said, the band has mellowed some with time; thrillingly, this album's title track could run with singles like ""Apply Some Pressure"" or ""Our Velocity"", but Maxïmo Park otherwise deal with milder tempos on <i>The National Health</i>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The album's lack of careening energy is occasionally made up for with strong songwriting, most notably in the small stretch from ""The Undercurrents"" through ""Reluctant Love"". Other times, though, they plow through songs without hitting a solid hook, or try on styles that don't quite fit: ""This Is What Becomes of the Broken Hearted"" and ""Take Me Home"" especially sound like the someone dared Maxïmo Park to write a few <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2010-the-hold-steady/"">Hold Steady</a> songs. And for as good a frontman as Smith can be, his singing isn't quite suited for the jangly classic rock that they try and pull off on those songs. At other times, the band goes for something heavier and louder, but that doesn't quite work either. Smith often sounds like he's fighting his band for control; you can almost imagine his throat fraying as he battles piles and piles of riffs on ""Banlieue"" and ""Waves of Fear"". Better are songs like ""Write This Down"", where the instruments are simply mixed lower than Smith's vocals and his melodies drive the song. Not coincidentally, that's the song on <i>The National Help</i> with the most memorable chorus. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The title portends a political bent, and the title track does itch with anxiousness over England's present (deep cuts to the NHS have been threatened), while Smith's bandmates bring black humor in the form of a mocking gallery. But politics are mostly a sideline here; like a true romantic, singer Paul Smith is still much more concerned with the status of his heart and his bed. It's not so much Maxïmo Park's political album as it is a typical Maxïmo Park album rattled slightly by a rocky Western world, one where Smith's romantic pursuits are often fueled by a fear of losing out to society's apathy. Maybe that explicit awareness of falling behind (on ""Waves of Fear"", Smith tells a romantic pursuit that they ""will overcome the apathetics we've become"") has something to do with it. Maxïmo Park so often sound on <i>The National Health </i>like they're trying too hard, struggling to find a sound that once came naturally. </p></div>"|16728.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16728-the-national-health/|5.8|Jordan Sargent

Available either as an impressive (and pricey) vinyl box set or as 2xCD compilation, <i>Music for the Quiet Hour / The Drawbar Organ EPs</i> sees Shackleton sink even further into grotesque dub madness. It's the work of an experimental composer more so than a dance producer, as this release (especially the macabre pit that is <i>Music for the Quiet Hour</i>) shares headspace with British masters of spleen like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3079-nurse-with-wound/"" target=""_blank"">Nurse With Wound</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/967-coil/"" target=""_blank"">Coil</a>.</p>
<p>The volume of material here, clocking in at an intimidating 137 minutes, isn't problematic: Shackleton neatly separates (relatively) shorter rhythmic pieces (<i>The Drawbar Organ EPs</i>) and epic apocalyptic screeds (<i>Quiet Hour</i>). He's said it can take months to properly layer his complex rhythmic patterns, and his trademark drum programming is on display on <i>The Drawbar Organ</i>. He's still mining drum sounds from Asia and Africa, so his pinging, pointillist attacks contain a harmonic complexity unavailable to gated snares and wump-wump kickdrums. On tracks like ""Test Tubes"" and ""Wish You Better"", this creates a crawling, organic sense of motion not unlike watching beetles scurry over one another. And like an insect colony, <i>Drawbar Organ</i> feels governed by maths that we're not privy to but are nonetheless fascinating to behold.</p>
<p>Melodically, <i>Drawbar Organ</i> is Shackleton's strongest work. Throughout he borrows more than dub reggae's ghostly reverb; he also nabs its dark spirituality and the soft, reedy tones of the melodica. Cut-up choirs speckle the record, and electric pianos and (duh) organs also feature heavily. They turn ""Katyusha"" into a roiling, acid-damaged burner. ""Seven Present Tenses"" is unholy worship, while ""(For the) Love of Weeping"" is quick and lucid. Syncopated basslines stalk the tracks like housecats.</p>
<p><i>Drawbar Organ</i> is a welcome expansion of the gray, minimal <i>Three EPs</i> (Shackleton's last solo full-length release), but it's <i>Music for the Quiet Hour</i> where his delirium shines. Just five tracks-- two of which are seven-minute bookends-- <i>Quiet Hour</i> welcomes back estranged collaborator Vengeance Tenfold, a spoken-word artist who who helps strangle Shackleton's most distended productions to date. (Tenfold is less laughably predictable than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7288-kode9-the-spaceape/"" target=""_blank"">Kode9</a>'s partner-in-misanthropy, Spaceape, but your enjoyment will correlate strongly with your fondness for garden-variety Revelations-style soothsayin'.)

The 21-minute centerpiece, ""Music for the Quiet Hour Part 4"", patters indecisively before a long vocal passage-- a grandfather dictating a letter to his grandson, Shackleton's most alluring spoken-word choice yet-- ushers the track into extended ambience, finding the midway point between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/15839-robert-ashley/"" target=""_blank"">Robert Ashley</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14226-digital-mystikz/"" target=""_blank"">Digital Mystikz</a>. </p>
<p><i>Quiet Hour</i> is the immersion experience that Shackleton has been building toward for years, an album that isn't just ""not really dance music""-- like many of his productions-- but one that aligns him with avant-garde composers as well as other, less-mannered freakniks.

He's been hanging around under his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30486-polysick/"" target=""_blank"">Polysick</a> guise since 2010, releasing CD-Rs and tapes for labels like <a href=""http://www.listentosilk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">100% Silk</a>, aligning him with a group of underground-oriented analog fetishists currently mining 1980s dance music. Polysick's tracks are shorter and sparser than those of one-time labelmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29535-ital/"" target=""_blank"">Ital</a> or Heatsick, and his debut album for Planet Mu, <i>Digital Native</i>, is full of proto-techno vignettes and swampy kraut ambles.</p>
<p><a href=""http://electronicexplorations.org/?show=polysick"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A mix</a> that Sopor put together earlier this year for <a href=""http://electronicexplorations.org/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Electronic Explorations</a> featured tracks by Italian soundtrack composer Piero Umiliani, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1149-drexciya/"" target=""_blank"">Drexciya</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1304-808-state/"" target=""_blank"">808 State</a>, artists whose music triangulates his sound better than any description could. The beats on <i>Digital Native</i>, when present, are simple, purposefully tinny, and respectful of the grid. His synthesizers have a homespun rigidity and they lean slightly to the left, like amateur carpentry. He loves squelchy, sour, acid-house timbres and stone-simple, early-Detroit constructions, a potent combination. Sopor is smart not to stuff his tracks; most of the time we're given a simple repeating arpeggio, a pattering beat, and another synthesizer acting as glaze. This leaves a lot of open air, and the best part about <i>Digital Native</i> is how easily it seems these elements could cast off like space junk at any moment.</p>
<p>What makes Sopor different from someone like Ital, though, is how explicitly he recreates the past. <i>Digital Native</i> has no hidden agenda and offers no commentary on technology or nostalgia. Since Sopor is not a preternaturally talented arranger or tunesmith, it's difficult to determine what, exactly, is being ventured during a moment when analog exploration is the <i>de rigueur</i> mode for underground composers. (The vintage stews offered by Panabrite and Pulse Emitter, for example, are meatier and more adventurous.) After its initial charms wear off-- and at 15 tracks and nearly an hour runtime, they will-- <i>Digital Native</i> slows to a dull plod. We're left with aural X-rays of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"" target=""_blank"">Boards of Canada</a> (""Lost Holidays"") and molasses-slow, pixelated lounge music (""Gondwana""). </p>
<p>Sopor has worked as a video producer and claims he makes his music to fantasized images. <i>Digital Native</i> is harmless analog tapestry, but it wilts under too much attention, unable to conjure the vivid scenes to which it was undoubtedly conceived. Sopor avoids careless mimicry-- he is not beholden to any one artist or style-- and there is plenty of potential in his blends. <i>Digital Native</i>, though, is too slight to truly honor, or build upon, its referents.</p></div>"|16818.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16818-digital-native/|5.8|Andrew Gaerig

The five-piece had nearly all the material for their debut album written and recorded before taking it to labels, giving the impression that they'd been locked away making what could be their first avant masterpiece. Of course, highbrow, obscure interests don't necessarily translate into whatever art or job you choose to occupy yourself with, but it feels like a red herring that Zulu Winter's debut album brims with the kind of mooing, wan electro-indie montage music typical of Bombay Bicycle Club and Two Door Cinema Club, the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5321-the-maccabees/"" target=""_blank"">Maccabees</a>, and the faintest shadow of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5720-foals/"" target=""_blank"">Foals</a>' less compelling material. Doused in interminable glimmering drones and wimpers, spending 45 minutes in its company feels like being smothered inside a snowglobe.</p>
<p><i>Language</i> seems boiled up in a lab as antidote for those Sunday afternoons at the Reading and Leeds festivals when burger bloat is taking its toll, and the idea of going to see <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26767-friendly-fires/"" target=""_blank"">Friendly Fires</a> seems just that bit too strenuous; it's a universal tongue intimating the cosy bosom of warm synthesizers, dreamy noodling, and softly cawed vocals. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12437-lets-move-back-to-front/"" target=""_blank"">""Let's Move Back to Front""</a> trembles, glimmers, and has a good old go at a cowbell ding-dong, bearing a herky jerky scat chorus that suggests embarking on this limp kinesis after promising the chance to ""dance 'til you don't know your name"" earlier in the verse. It's perfectly serviceable and not particularly offensive until the final minute, where they tack on some needless birdsong and vapid drones to no discernible end. They try and get fancy at the end of ""Never Leave"", too, topping off a litany of chanted ""non non non""s that make up the backbone of the song with the robotic incantation ""we should be swimming, swimming,"" seemingly a sort of ill-conceived <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/310-the-beach-boys/"" target=""_blank"">Beach Boys</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/96-animal-collective/"" target=""_blank"">Animal Collective</a> tribute. The appealingly dank quasi-minimal techno hum at the end of the song actually called ""We Should Be Swimming"" undulates quite beautifully, but it bears no relation to the previous few minutes. These moments feel like confused, half-grabs at experimentalism on an album that's sure to fill rafters and please younger listeners with its effortlessly epic reach, a suggestion that Zulu Winter are trying to deter the kind of audience that they know will come. </p>
<p>While much of the record is content to bumble along at a homely hum, there are a couple of moments that stick their heads above the parapet. ""Words That I Wield"" gains a sense of drama from its absolute sparseness in comparison to the thick blanketing production elsewhere; its stinging guitar pierces the mist, making like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7372-wild-beasts/"" target=""_blank"">Wild Beasts</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15436-smother/"" target=""_blank""><i>Smother</i></a> unwillingly coerced into a nightclub situation. And although firing into a widescreen emotional gamut is destined to burst one or two euphoric heart piñatas, closer ""People That You Must Remember"" is the only song here that feels believably moving, a sense of loss shivering through its icy, itchy drift, and singer Daunt's vocal tugging with an emotion more complex than ""please do sing along."" However Zulu Winter choose to proceed, one thing they have to learn is that you can't stick a two-minute drone onto the end of a song that sounds like Two Door Cinema Club and call it experimental. Whilst homogeneity will undoubtedly serve them well enough, there are tantalizing signs here of a more innovative future.</p></div>"|16623.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16623-language/|4.9|Laura Snapes

Raymond</i> wasn't particularly memorable, but it did provide a platform for an up-and-coming rapper named <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28745-nicki-minaj/"" target=""_blank"">Nicki Minaj</a>. On the single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11699-little-freak-ft-nicki-minaj/"" target=""_blank"">""Lil Freak""</a>, cut in the early stages of her tear as an unassailable feature rapper, Minaj delivered one of the more remarkable verses of that year, rapping that she'd take girls ""to go see Usher... like Santa I keep a vixen"" before reeling off the names of all seven reindeer at a cadence that seemed inhuman. On his own song, Usher himself was pushed to the sideline by an artist on the fast track to superstardom. Given the weakness of the record as a whole, you had to wonder if we were witnessing a fading star content to go through the motions. For over a decade, Usher had a remarkable run of slow-burning R&amp;B singles and clattering club hits like 2001's ""U Remind Me"" and ""U Got It Bad"", 2004's ""Confessions Part II"" and Lil Jon crunk-anthem collaboration ""Yeah!"". But on <i>Raymond vs. Raymond</i>, an album recorded on the heels of a divorce, Usher felt uncharacteristically flat and aimless. </p>
<p>Fast-forward two years, to the closing track of Usher's new LP, <i>Looking 4 Myself</i>. Here, another upstart New York rapper riffs on Minaj's ""Lil Freak"" verse: ""Go Nicki Minaj flow when I hit the verse-uh/ If you let me ménage/ I'll take you to see <i>Ursher</i>,"" raps <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a>. But whereas Minaj was the centerpiece of ""Lil Freak"", Rocky-- along with a whole pack of very of-the-moment collaborators found on <i>Looking 4 Myself</i>-- plays a supporting role to Usher. The singer has clearly found a groove as a reinvigorated leading man, and at 33 years old and seven albums in, Usher's showing just how well he can adapt to a slippery contemporary pop landscape. Along with a cast that includes everyone from Diplo and Noah ""40"" Shebib to Rick Ross and Pharrell, Usher offers up a sharp new collection that serves as a fresh sampler of a smattering of genres, from slick R&amp;B to electronic dance pop to funk. </p>
<p>Since it's packed with so many guests and touches on so many styles, <i>Looking 4 Myself</i> invites skepticism. On paper, it looks like an artist throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks, but Usher mostly transcends charges of dilettantism. The opening track, ""Can't Stop Won't Stop"", for instance, builds like a throwaway Eurodance arena anthem, but instead of exploding into oblivion after the breakdown it splits into a fizzy and wonky slap of a beat. Part of the success is due to Usher's vocal virtuosity, which in places reaches Michael Jackson-levels of purity. On ballad ""Dive"", he uses shamelessly literal and explicit lyrics that might make you cringe if they'd come from of anyone else: ""It's raining inside your bed/ No parts are dry/ Lovin' made you so wet/ Your Legs/ Your thighs,"" he sings. His vocal mastery allows him to carry a cornball verse like that and transform the song into something more specific, as if he were addressing just one woman instead of delivering a pre-packaged ballad <i>for the ladies</i>. </p>
<p>Still, Usher's strength lies in R&amp;B, and he's adjusted well to shifting ground. <i>Since Raymond vs. Raymond</i>, artists like Drake, the Weeknd, and Frank Ocean have developed darker and more atmospheric strains and attracted listeners who previously avoided the genre. Usher excels on a few songs here that cover similar ground, like the dark click-popper ""Lessons for the Lover"" and ""What Happened To U"", a velvety track sung mostly in falsetto helmed by Drake and Weeknd producer Noah ""40"" Shebib. Hearing those songs, it feels like some of the younger artists might have learned a thing or two from Usher when they were formulating their own styles. So while he could have come off as an artist trying to keep up with the kids in that realm, Usher seems instead like an elder statesman with a keen ear for the right collaborators, particularly in choosing Diplo on his surprising lead single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13160-climax/"" target=""_blank"">""Climax""</a>. </p>
<p>At 18 tracks, not everything on <i>Looking 4 Myself</i> hits the mark, and the album drags on longer than it should. Where the experimentation often succeeds, the editing fails. Usher sounds most uncomfortable and the least sharp on overblown club tracks with long, faceless lists of European producers (see ""Euphoria"" and ""Numb""), and the presence of rote numbers is almost comically predicable. These grabs at low-hanging fruit aside, Usher serves as a good reminder that it's possible to cater to the demands of a discombobulated industry and come out on top. </p></div>"|16727.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16727-looking-for-myself/|7.6|Carrie Battan

Two decades later, it feels much less important to mention that the album-- which featured the immortally cool, often-imitated, never-duplicated hit single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWsRz3TJDEY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Buffalo Stance""</a>-- earned her a Brit Award for Best International Solo Artist than it does to tell you that she had the award melted down and made into jewelry, some of which she gave to her fellow nominees. ""I gave <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23627-jazzie-b/"" target=""_blank"">Jazzie B</a> a piece,"" she explained later, ""Because Soul II Soul kicked ass that year.""</p>
<p>Then again, there were even earlier indicators. Cherry was raised by her stepfather, free jazz pioneer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18454-don-cherry/"" target=""_blank"">Don Cherry</a>, and her upbringing was as unconventional, well-connected and precociously musical as you'd imagine. From an early age, she and her siblings accompanied Cherry on the tour bus, hanging out with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/793-ornette-coleman/"" target=""_blank"">Ornette Coleman</a> and any other jazz legends who happened to be around (age four: ""[<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1023-miles-davis/"" target=""_blank"">Miles Davis</a>] lifted me up on his lap... and I sat on his snakeskin suit""). At 14, she toured as a backup singer for tribal punk firebrands <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4113-the-slits/"" target=""_blank"">the Slits</a>; two years later, she formed a punk group of her own, Rip Rig + Panic. Cherry's subsequent solo output was, predictably, unpredictable: three records that blended hip-hop, trip-hop, be-bop with spirited, genre-agnostic abandon. Her disinterest in more conventional pop success relegated her to one-hit-wonder status in the U.S., but, as the more adventurous fans who followed her through the 90s know, it freed her up to graze more interesting territory.</p>
<p>And Cherry's collaborators on her first full-length in 16 years are wild horses in their own right. The freewheeling, punk-influenced Scandanavian jazz trio <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/7563-the-thing/"" target=""_blank"">the Thing</a> (named for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbIp6qOKd7E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Don Cherry song</a>) are to avant-garde jazz what <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6442-nico-muhly/"" target=""_blank"">Nico Muhly</a> basically is to classical music: preternaturally talented upstarts with respect on their highbrow home turf but also plenty of indie cred by association. The Thing have jammed with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3874-thurston-moore/"" target=""_blank"">Thurston Moore</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3176-jim-orourke/"" target=""_blank"">Jim O'Rourke</a>, and they've got some exhilaratingly knotty <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1896-pj-harvey/"" target=""_blank"">PJ Harvey</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26015-the-white-stripes/"" target=""_blank"">White Stripes</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2481-lightning-bolt/"" target=""_blank"">Lightning Bolt</a> covers in their repertoire. </p>
<p>So, somehow, <i>The Cherry Thing</i>, the album that the free-spirited pop star and the impish free jazz ensemble made together, is not the indulgent, impenetrable mess that you might expect; just the opposite, actually. It's a remarkably well-defined, cohesive, and above all things inviting listen, and at eight tracks it feels neither slight nor needlessly sprawling. Consisting almost entirely of covers and concocted from an unpretentious, no-frills sonic palette, <i>The Cherry Thing</i> is an exercise of the freedom you can invent within certain limits. Can you create new sensations from well-worn material? Is anything so sacred that you can't melt it down into jewelry?</p>
<p>Naturally, the covers included on the album are as genre-agnostic as the artists who chose them. There's a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"" target=""_blank"">Stooges</a> classic, an Ornette Coleman track, a song from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5579-madvillainy/"" target=""_blank""><i>Madvillainy</i></a>, and, sparking with raw, electric energy (every track was recorded in a single take), each one is a live wire. Cherry's loose but rhythmically agile vocals wrestle with Mats Gustaffson's wild saxophone riffs; they occasionally convene to share the melody (as on one of two originals, Gustaffson's ""Sudden Moment""). More often, they dance around each other in spasms of controlled chaos. Paal Nilssen-Love on drums and Ingebright Haker-Flaten on the double bass keep things grounded. There's something especially earthy-sounding about their rhythm section and Haker-Flaten's playing in particular, as though he were plucking not strings but vines strung up between trees. As all of these dynamic moving parts try their best to step in time, their terrific, lurching take on the Stooges' ""Dirt"" has the deliberate, menacing stomp of a 10-foot swamp monster learning how to walk.</p>
<p>Veering from low, jazzy trills to sharp spoken word, Cherry's vocals are phenomenally expressive: On the cover of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2909-madvillain/"" target=""_blank"">Madvillain</a>'s ""Accordian"", she sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2040-billie-holiday/"" target=""_blank"">Billie Holiday</a> at a poetry slam. The original ""Accordian"" fades out shy of two minutes, and Doom's surreal imagery, clock-tick beat and here-and-then-it's-gone duration give it the hazy magic of a naptime dream. The Cherry Thing's <a href=""http://cms.pitchfork.com/news/46393-watch-neneh-cherry-and-the-thing-cover-madvillain/?utm_medium=site&amp;utm_source=more-content&amp;utm_name=news"" target=""_blank"">""Accordian""</a>-- utterly transformed-- is three times as long, as though that clock's been chucked out of the room. Cherry tiptoes on, off, and around the beat, reveling in every line. ""Keep your glory, gold, and glitter,"" she wrenches first into a chorus, then into a mantra.</p>
<p>Cherry is recording a solo album that's slated for release later in the year, and although she and the Thing are playing a few shows together this summer, it's likely <i>The Cherry Thing</i> will be a one-off: a solid souvenir of what sounds like a pretty fun four-day jam. Still, more than just a forgettable pit stop in two wildly careening careers, <i>The Cherry Thing</i> captures some kind of fleeting magic. It's also something of a paradox: a deeply personal covers album. The ghost of the players' shared past, Don Cherry (who died of cancer in 1995), wrote one of the most inspired songs on the album, ""Golden Heart"". For the Thing and Neneh both, it's a tribute to the man who got them started on the wild, uncharted career arcs they're still inventing as they go. As the track subsides, she's crooning his words back to him: ""You live with me in the golden heart.""</p></div>"|16756.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16756-the-cherry-thing/|8.0|Lindsay Zoladz

That 2011 album by producer Daniel Lopatin was a small masterpiece, one of the few albums of experimental music that both defined a new sonic space and was accessible enough to appeal to listeners with only so much time for musical abstraction. It's tempting to call it a leap forward for Lopatin, but probably more accurate to think of it as a snapshot from an artist unconcerned with linear movement. It was <i>a</i> place, not <i>the</i> place, and there was nothing inevitable about it. And now, a year later, OPN returns with a brief four-song EP of remixes and reworks of a few of <i>Replica</i>'s tracks. Since the original album was highly modular, the compositions built and transformed from discrete parts you could also admire in isolation, turning these elements over to others to arrange as they see fit is a worthwhile experiment.</p>
<p>For <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/980-matmos/"" target=""_blank"">Matmos</a>, who <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46690-oneohtrix-point-never-to-release-replica-remixes/"" target=""_blank"">re-work the title track</a> with contributions on vocals and viola from experimental composer Limpe Fuchs, that means shuffling Lopatin's sound fragments into a bed of their own idiosyncratic way with rhythm. Electronic music has long been split in factions that can be traced back to academia and factions that can be traced back to the club; Matmos' music, while never fully of either world, always finds a way to incorporate both. Their distinctive ear for beats, with tracks built around a pulse that could come from no one else, is their defining quality. Their version of ""Replica"" feels simultaneously awkward and precise, a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/425-the-books/"" target=""_blank"">Books</a>-like neo-classical tumble through piano riffs and voices and string plucks. Since the general tone of <i>Replica</i> leans toward heady and serious, their lighter run highlights some of the more playful and wistful ends of Lopatin's sound world. The second track, Lopatin's edit of ""Replica"", which includes vocals by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27867-king-midas-sound/"" target=""_blank"">King Midas Sound</a>'s Roger Robinson, brings to mind <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11745-antony-hegarty/"" target=""_blank"">Antony</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11957-returnal-ft-antony/"" target=""_blank"">version of ""Returnal""</a>, where an instrumental was stripped down to its essence and revealed to be a bed for a proper song. As Robinson sings it, ""Replica"" sounds like an austere ballad from the post-rock 90s-- something from Gastr del Soul's <i>Camoufleur</i>, say-- something both chilly and intellectual but also seeded with mystery and emotion.</p>
<p>Less interesting are the two pieces on the back half. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4004-surgeon/"" target=""_blank"">Surgeon</a> turns the vocal-laden drone ""Remember"" into a thick but ultimately anonymous bit of industrial techno. His sources seem as if they could have come from anywhere, and the relationship of the remix to the original is unclear. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4689-richard-youngs/"" target=""_blank"">Richard Youngs</a> has an even more difficult task taking on the astonishing memory painting ""Nassau"", and his radical re-work is interesting if ultimately not particularly memorable. Jettisoning the delicate and careful construction of the original, he more or less compresses the individual sounds into a ball of noise and moves it around the space in orbit of a wailing vocal incantation. It's not intense enough to be overpowering and the structure is too loose and the track too short to admire how it unfolds. So, two tracks you might play again, two tracks you probably won't. These four pieces, taken together, are a nice demonstration of the malleable nature of Lopatin's recent work, and if nothing else they'll have you hearing the originals in a slightly different way.</p></div>"|16789.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16789-dog-in-the-fog/|6.8|Mark Richardson

However, the principle did manifest in other forms of sonic warfare, many of which appear in our everyday lives without our noticing. Late at night outside grocery stores, malls, and other prime lollygagging spots, an alarm known as SonicScreen, or the Mosquito, blares at a frequency only teenagers can hear in order to stop them loitering in the vicinity. You get the impression that these alarms are designed to ward off exactly the kind of kids that are going to find release in the debut album from Australian duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30438-dz-deathrays/"" target=""_blank"">DZ Deathrays</a>, where heshing, BMXing, and making yourself sick on lurching rollercoasters are a way of life, when you're not bumming around on street corners. And if there were ever a teen colony they wanted to keep free of adults, then <i>Bloodstreams</i> would prove ample weaponry.</p>
<p>As may be apparent, <i>Bloodstreams</i>' principal methods of assault are volume and vitriol. DZ Deathrays formed to play house parties, and they say they'll ""most likely end at one,"" too. It's not hard to imagine the floor falling out beneath them as they unleash one of the mighty ""OWWWWW""s that blast through the end of a number of their songs like a sonic turbo boost button. DZ Deathrays' house is a place you'll want to go, and it's on a street close to that of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27595-japandroids/"" target=""_blank"">Japandroids</a>' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16564-japandroids-celebration-rock/"" target=""_blank""><i>Celebration Roc</i>k</a>. If you hit up David Prowse and Brian King's joint to hug your friends in a seething sweaty mess and declare how much you love each other, then you'll go to Shane Parsons and Simon Ridley's to smash the furniture with the force of everyone who ever wronged you fuelling the punch.</p>
<p>Sound unpleasant? Once you unearth them from beneath 12 layers of fuzz and squall, the main emotions on display are spite and bitterness. Opener ""Teenage Kickstarts"" sets the tone: ""Broke my bones in catastrophe/ Broke my heart in a heartbeat/ I've been held down, kept stripped back/ Take my chance, yeah/ Bound to fall apart/ Can't break my kickstart."" DZ Deathrays are on a path to self-destruction, with only their copies of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2587-youre-a-woman-im-a-machine/"" target=""_blank""><i>You're a Woman, I'm a Machine</i></a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2921-the-mae-shi/"" target=""_blank""><i>HLLLYH</i></a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4787-be-your-own-pet/"" target=""_blank"">Be Your Own Pet</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9083-be-your-own-pet/"" target=""_blank"">debut</a> in hand. ""Teenage Kickstarts"" bowls along as if held together by spunk and iron filings, lurching like a ship on the high seas into a batshit mental breakdown at the end. ""Trans Am"" is less aggressive sonically, but its only lyrics are, ""Dead or alive/ Dead or alive/ Give the wings to me and drive into the sun.""</p>
<p>But if we're going to hell in a handbasket, DZ Deathrays know that the dirt-track ride there has to be fun. The dumbly named ""Dollar Chills"" could be an ode to the vacuousness of the Patrick Bateman era, a beefy bronco lurch setting off ricocheting video game effects, eventually flooding itself with tidal sweeps of cymbal crash and guitar feedback. There's a rival gang in pursuit on ""L.A. Lightning""-- ""Keys in the car running/ Can't beat the BMX""-- which is the most direct crib of DFA1979's upward tugged strut here. Plenty of these songs have the same structure, and are just a riff a few frets removed from the previous track, but they're executed with the impulse that makes you go on the same roller coaster 12 times in a row.</p>
<p>There are more adult moments on <i>Bloodstreams</i>, but they're the least fun parts. Following ""Dollar Chills"", ""Dumb it Down"" is striking in its sparseness, a juddering electronic stutter with a little <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1063-depeche-mode/"" target=""_blank"">Depeche Mode</a> on its side and a borderline emotional refrain, but it lacks in the thrills so readily available elsewhere. ""Witchcraft"" feels like it's seeking some sort of map or guidance on the road to ruin, coming off too in hock to the traditions of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/379-black-sabbath/"" target=""_blank"">Black Sabbath</a> in comparison to the rest of the record's bratty, pillaging ways.</p>
<p>The finest song here, <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/dzdeathrays/gebbie-street-1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Gebbie Street""</a>, holds its hands behind its back for the first minute and a half, Parsons coolly observing, ""Your eyes like diamond, speckled gold/ You know our bodies make the right conversation,"" over a tight, swaggering snare click, before a great whiplashing ""YOWWWW!"" turns the song inside out, and ""Make me feel explosions in my blood"" becomes ""in my BLAAAAAAH!"" <i>Bloodstreams</i> is the kind of record that makes you feel explosions in your ""blah,"" a giant loogie hock against the pricks that perpetuate the everyday. If a DZ video doesn't get a spot on the reincarnated ""Beavis and Butthead"", an opportunity will have been missed. Like that high-pitched whistle that SonicScreens play outside corner shops, there'll come a time when what DZ Deathrays are doing no longer resonates with you.

On <i>Falling Off the Sky</i>, <a href=""http://thedbs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the dB's</a> invoke their long-ago heyday and acknowledge that they'll never be young again. ""Better wake up, wake up, wake up, that time is gone!"" Peter Holsapple exhorts the listener over a modified <i>Nuggets</i> garage groove. Despite that disclaimer, there's a familiar depth to the guitars, which don't jangle so much as they slice and pop and rumble. It's both a fitting reminder that they were always more at home in the studio than on stage, where they could tweak and refine their sound endlessly, and a nod to that long-gone time, the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the dB's were the best North Carolina band in New York, sprouting from the ashes of Sneakers and moonlighting in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28727-alex-chilton/"" target=""_blank"">Alex Chilton</a>'s band and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3556-rem/"" target=""_blank"">R.E.M.</a> The dB's' first records-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11718-stands-for-decibelsrepercussion/"" target=""_blank"">1981's <i>Stands for DeciBels</i> and 1982's <i>Repercussion</i></a>-- mixed paisley-strewn mod rock with prickly postpunk, sunny West Coast harmonies, Big Star pop romanticism, and the jittery jangle that was then becoming a signature of Southern college bands.</p>
<p>After a handful of fine albums in the 1980s and one more in 1994, all of which were recorded under different lineups, the dB's went mostly silent, as the original quartet focused on various side projects and production gigs. In 2012, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7779-the-life-and-music-of-alex-chilton/"" target=""_blank"">Chilton has passed</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44074-rem-break-up/"" target=""_blank"">R.E.M. have broken up</a>, but most of their peers, including <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5948-the-feelies/"" target=""_blank"">the Feelies</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2906-mission-of-burma/"" target=""_blank"">Mission of Burma</a>, have actually reunited. Rather than simply reliving past glories, the dB's are trying to create new ones on <i>Falling Off the Sky</i>. These songs may contain familiar nods to the past-- the members' tastes have remained constant well into their careers-- but they're approaching those influences from new angles and assembling them into new shapes. This is, naturally, their most grown-up album. The dB's capably make the case that these sounds can speak to middle-age contentment just as they once conveyed youthful discontent.</p>
<p>The transition is smooth, so they're not embarrassing themselves. But in the case of the dB's, the happiness of men in their 50s turns out to be less compelling than the angst of men in their 20s. Lyrically ""The Wonder of Love"" and ""Before We Were Born"" tend toward the settled and the saccharine, and musically ""Far Away and Long Ago"" sounds like something you'd hear in an Athens elevator, at least until the drums come in and distract from the chintzy strings and staid classical guitar. Among so many mushy sentiments, Will Rigby's ""Write Back"" is a pleasantly surprising standout. He pairs a clever epistolary concept with a playful sense of self-deprecation, and his strange, mewling vocal turns the repetitive chorus into the album's liveliest hook: ""I'll never reply to your reply to my reply to your reply to my letter."" It's the sound of a man out of touch with technology, but also out of his depth in even the most casual exchanges, yet he conveys the romantic alienation with a sly humor.</p>
<p>Perhaps more than any other song on <i>Falling Off the Sky</i>, ""Write Back"" hints at why we care that a band has reunited so long after its glory days: At their best, albums like this one have the potential to define a new perspective from which to view the world, one that can throw a band's older material into sharp relief. But the dB's don't redefine themselves as defiantly as they once did, so the best moments are the most specific ones, like when they sing about listening to Delany &amp; Bonnie on ""Collide-oOo-Scope"" or lament a friend's failing health on ""She Won't Drive in the Rain Anymore"". But there's never quite enough of the everyday on these songs, which they almost admit on ""Send Me Something Real"". After making the title plea, however, Holsapple undercuts the yearning with too much self-seriousness: ""because I don't remember how it feels to be free and pure."" That angst-- experienced by musicians and listeners who've been consigned to the reunion circuit or the Collector's Edition treatment-- could be a compelling topic for a comeback album, but <i>Falling Off the Sky</i> misses the opportunity to explore that fear of obsolescence too deeply. Which is a shame. These songs are loud enough, but they need more dB's.</p></div>"|16800.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16800-falling-off-the-sky/|5.7|Stephen Deusner

""I was into Black Sabbath and it just wasn't cool, but I didn't give a shit: My band was going to sound like Black Sabbath because I fucking wanted it to and I didn't give a shit what some idiot fuck thought,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6064-billy-corgan/"" target=""_blank"">he spat at Julianne Shepherd 2005</a>, apropos of nothing, around the release of his solo album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1810-the-future-embrace/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Future Embrace</i></a>. The quote, with its fascinating blend of indomitable will and boiling spite, is pure Corgan. For better or for worse, this energy is his fuel: He will reach transcendence, goddammit, with or without you.</p>
<p>The last few years have borne sad witness to this worldview's inevitable end point. When Jimmy Chamberlin, the band's lone remaining original member, departed in 2009, saying only, ""I can no longer commit all of my energy into something that I don't fully possess,"" Corgan became the last one standing. His announcement that he would be keeping the Pumpkins name and recruiting new members was hardly surprising. The Pumpkins had always been Corgan's dream, after all, the other members mere action figures recruited for its realization. Even the ridiculous band name, which the other members wore with the ease of an ugly sweater hand-picked by their mom, was a remnant of Corgan's boyhood vision. ""The name of the band is a stupid name, a dumb bad joke and a bad idea, OK?"" original bassist D'arcy Wretzky <a href=""http://www.spfc.org/band/faq.html?faq_id=47"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">snapped to the Washington Post back in 1993</a>. ""Billy named the band before there even was a band. He was like, 'I'm gonna have a band and it's gonna be called this.'""</p>
<p>Now, Corgan has surrounded himself with a new crew, one presumably more excited to be sporting the team jersey. Mike Byrne (drums), Nicole Fiorentino (bass), and Jeff Schroeder (guitar) were assembled via ""It could be you!"" open auditions: Nineteen-year-old Byrne, for example, was a freshman at the Berklee School of Music when Corgan recruited him. This crew is charged with the unenviable task of making the first record since 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10409-zeitgeist/"" target=""_blank""><i>Zeitgeist</i></a> to bear the Smashing Pumpkins name. Given the conditions, they do the best job possible.</p>
<p>In terms of sheer sound, <i>Oceania</i> hits its mark: It succeeds, at least, in seeming Pumpkins-y. The towering slab of guitars, the sense of hurtling forward motion, the alt-rock-meets-<i>Les Mis</i> sweep, are present, and help make <i>Oceania</i> Corgan's most worthwhile work in years. Opener ""Quasar"" features plenty of pile-driving riffing, and you can hear the new members working overtime to justify their spots: Byrne's drums have some of the fluid propulsion of Chamberlin's, and Schroeder's leads are ear-catching but unshowy. When Corgan's thin, keening voice enters over the mass of sound, you believe, for a moment or two.</p>
<p>But the songs themselves lack the soaring melodies Corgan used to grace them with, and his voice is a little rougher, coarser. The arrangements suffer from a whiff of generic, corporate-rock slickness. Would that this record actually had some of the thick-caked doom of the Sabbath records Corgan built his tower out of. The entire album, meanwhile, suffers from rote, obvious lyrics, which lean heavy on the ""I'm always on your side""/ ""Everything I want is free""/ ""There's a sun that shines in me"" School-of-Rock madlibs approach.</p>
<p>It's also difficult not to notice he's repeating himself: The introductory riff to ""Quasar"" is nearly identical to that of ""Cherub Rock"". The power ballad ""The Celestials"" recalls ""Disarm"", while the open-hearted, dramatic plea at the center of ""Violet Rays"" (""I'll leave with anyone this night/ And I'll kiss anyone tonight"") is an almost-direct quote from <i>Mellon Collie</i>'s ""In the Arms of Sleep"". ""Pale Horse"" echoes the chord progression of ""Thru the Eyes of Ruby"". This is the classic Pumpkins sound, but an echo of itself; its spirit is somehow enervated.</p>
<p>What you do hear on <i>Oceania</i> is a reawakening of Corgan's ambitions. The album feels bigger and covers more ground than anything he's done in a decade: There are neon electronic interludes, folk-rock breakdowns, songs that morph from wintry ballads to grim rock stomps. ""Pinwheels"" starts with a flitting-hummingbird synth line, layers of droning cello, and George Harrison-style guitar before collapsing into a lovely folk-rock breakdown with softened, cascading female background vocals. Uptempo rocker ""The Chimera"" has an infectious chorus, and the title track churns darkly through multiple sections without losing momentum.</p>
<p><i>Oceania</i> is reportedly only the middle section of a larger, looming 44-song epic bearing the Terry-Brooks-fantasy-series title <i>Teargarden by Kaleidyscope</i>. It's exhausting to imagine this record sitting inside something three times its length. But Corgan thinks only in epics-- double albums, <a href=""http://991.com/NewGallery/Smashing-Pumpkins-The-Aeroplane-Fli-76593.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">boxed sets that come in suitcase packaging</a>-- and this generosity is the upside of his world-conquering ambition. Corgan made <i>Oceania</i> available with no advance copies or radio singles, an attempt to preserve the pre-digital ""everyone all at once"" album experience he fondly remembers. This gesture, like many of Corgan's, combines astronomical rock-star hubris with a kind of weird largesse: He very badly wants to give his audience something enormous, undeniable, and life-changing.</p>
<p>But this impulse has a dark side. Like Corgan recording countless vocal takes of ""Zero"" and <a href=""http://members.tripod.com/porcelina_oceans/sp_closed/press/rsfeb96.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">grading them with a series of check marks</a>. Or recording all of <i>Siamese Dream</i>'s bass parts because he could complete them in fewer takes. Corgan used to be able to absolve his personal failings in rock'n'roll, but rock'n'roll can only do so much. His new band might not question him very much, and they may play better or more professionally, than his old crew. But <i>Oceania</i> suffers a kind of rock-star-dictator airlessness. ""I'm all by myself/ As I've always felt,"" Corgan sang, on <i>Siamese Dream</i>'s ""Soma"", surrounded by his bandmates and newly ascendant. ""I'm alone, so alone, but better than I ever was,"" he sings, sadly, on <i>Oceania's</i> title track, surrounded by a hired-via-contest crew of strangers. You can always be more alone.</p></div>"|16742.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16742-oceania/|6.3|Jayson Greene

One song, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13724-beautiful-son/"" target=""_blank"">""Beautiful Son""</a>, is apparently about Mikko, the baby born last year to duo Indra Dunis and Aaron Coyes. And the child ""sings"" on another, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13480-lo-hi/"" target=""_blank"">""Lo Hi""</a>, mixing his gurgles with mom's soothing hums and dad's homemade synths. But Mikko's role in <i>Lucifer</i> highlights something that's been there all along. Built with simple loops and easily memorized hooks, Peaking Lights' music has always been kid-friendly. And they've always been smitten with repetition, like a toddler happy to watch an episode of ""Yo Gabba Gabba!"" over and over. If this Peaking Lights album is for kids, all of them are.</p>
<p>More interesting than whether youngsters will dig <i>Lucifer</i> is what that possibility says about Peaking Lights' Technicolor swirl of psych, synth-pop, reggae, and dub. Their approach taps into something childlike without sounding artificially crude or annoyingly naive. The way they spin together strands of cycling bass, pulsing keyboard, and reverberating voice echoes how kids are fascinated by things adults take for granted. In the process, Dunis and Coyes find energy in relaxation, vitality in letting things take their course. Maybe that's why a song as beatific and sun-staring as ""Beautiful Son"" seems to have a pumping heart, even though Coyes never injects it with a beat.</p>
<p>Still, this album is called <i>Lucifer</i>, so maybe don't bring it to your friend's baby shower. Coyes claims they picked that title because ""it means 'Venus, bearer of light' and is the first sign of the sunrise."" But it also hints at some darkness beneath the sunny exterior. The album opens with the rattling ""Moonrise"" and ends with the hazy ""Morning Star"", suggesting this journey happens at night. And things get murkier as the album approaches dawn. Later tracks such as the throbbing ""Midnight (in the Valley of Shadows)"" and the dense ""Dream Beat"" mimic earlier songs in structure, but conjure a foggier atmosphere, as sounds slowly blur and fuse into thicker layers.</p>
<p>Those denser moments evoke artists on the farther edge of dub-riding sound: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5373-high-places/"" target=""_blank"">High Places</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28951-sun-araw/"" target=""_blank"">Sun Araw</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1831-gang-gang-dance/"" target=""_blank"">Gang Gang Dance</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1411-excepter/"" target=""_blank"">Excepter</a>. On the poppier end, I can hear <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3945-stereolab/"" target=""_blank"">Stereolab</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9486-tom-tom-club/"" target=""_blank"">Tom Tom Club</a>, even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/630-blondie/"" target=""_blank"">Blondie</a> in <i>Lucifer</i>'s bouncier jams. These comparisons aren't meant to degrade Peaking Lights' individuality, but enhance it, because none of the above straddle simplicity and complexity quite the way this pair does. When they mold melody into mantra on something like the ethereal ""Cosmic Tides"", they give off both a broad universality and an inimitable personality.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's where Peaking Lights' kid connection severs a bit. Where a child is personality in flux, this duo's musical character came out of the womb fully formed. <i>Lucifer </i>is just their third album, and yet it's unmistakably drenched in their specific brand of patience and calm. If that suggests stasis, well, maybe that's not such a bad thing. For me <i>Lucifer </i>nudges their sound forward, but even if it were just a repeat-- another great loop, so to speak-- Peaking Lights are still a long way from the bottom of their self-made musical well.</p></div>"|16737.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16737-lucifer/|7.9|Marc Masters

It was hard to guess <i>who</i> was making Piano Magic's records. On their singles compilation, 2001's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6282-seasonally-affective-1996-2000/"" target=""_blank""><i>Seasonally Affective</i></a>, you'd get twee surrealist monologues about baking bread or reading Richard Brautigan novels backed by spooky field recordings of atmospheric disturbances. And then a tender song about small-town loneliness seemingly played on Victorian clockwork novelties; next, a blasted industrial soundscape that bore little evidence of human intervention at all.</p>
<p>A lot of that mysterious feeling has slowly drifted from Piano Magic's music over the last decade, as mastermind Glen Johnson seems to have decided rather firmly that he is a Serious Writer of Serious Songs. At his best, he's really more of an atmosphere and texture kind of talent, creating wonderfully unstable mood pieces that seesaw between poignancy and unease. Lyrics get pared back to evocative fragments. In traditional songwriter mode, he's too often both strident and vague, trying to forcefully put across images that don't really evoke much of anything, and becoming less sure of his skills as a homespun collage artist when he tries to tackle verse-chorus-verse.</p>
<p>Even more so than their suitably grim concept album about WWI, <i>Artists' Rifles</i>, <i>Life Has Not Finished With Me Yet</i> might be the starkest and most self-consciously serious Piano Magic album so far. It's also the <i>eeriest</i> Piano Magic album in a good long while, with a discomforted air due to the album's minimalism. A lot of it sounds like music made by a prisoner who's been allowed only a rickety old drum machine and a few half-broken electronic devices. Odd skeletal melodies play out uneasily but hypnotically against the record's yawning emptiness, like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4691-young-marble-giants/"" target=""_blank"">Young Marble Giants</a>' tunes if they'd dropped the tempo to a crawl. </p>
<p>Way too often though, <i>Life</i> comes off like melodramatic goth hooey. And not the fun kind. Johnson's never been a confessional singer-songwriter, and I doubt we're even getting straight emotional autobiography here. But with the voice up front and so much negative space behind, there's an undeniable ""dude sings about his feelings in an unadorned way"" vibe that's new for Piano Magic. Too bad the most raw and seemingly heartfelt moments are more than likely to induce snickers. The trouble usually arises when the lyrics make the mood of dread bluntly overt. The title track is some kind of nadir in this regard. To an irritating somnambulant sea shanty rhythm, Johnson reels off line after goofily portentous line (""The gun in my hand/ But the trigger, it jammed"") with total conviction but zero oomph. You might take it for a bit of dark comedy about clinical depression and suicidal ideation if it wasn't played so limp and straight.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's just the way he sings it. <i>Life</i> might have been monstrous in the hands of someone like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5841-michael-gira/"" target=""_blank"">Michael Gira</a>, who has both the gravitas and enough of a self-mocking side to pull off such severe sentiments. What really cripples certain parts of <i>Life</i>, as it has so often on post-<i>Rifles</i> Piano Magic records, is Johnson's singing. Johnson's gloomy monotone was effective in a limited way when it was just one element in the overall gloomy swirl of his music, and when he stays in this lane on <i>Life</i>, it fits. But in these severe settings, his vocal flaws become all the more apparent, occasionally even grating when he tries to emote. ""The Slightest of Threads"" will test even the band's staunchest fan.</p>
<p>Piano Magic's masterpiece-thus-far, 1999's <i>Low Birth Weight</i>, closed with a cover of Disco Inferno's ""Waking Up"", a rather chilling vision of a world without God, and Johnson finally gave the song an after-the-bomb ambience to match. It was emblematic of a consistent darkness to their music; but that darkness was never <i>all</i> there was to the band, even though <i>Life</i> sometimes seems based entirely around the sound and feel of that ""Waking Up"" cover. Early Piano Magic songs could be fragile and precious, but also assured and unearthly, less about foregrounding the warmth and intimacy of regular people playing in a room. Instead they used sound-design and electronic color to transform songs into slightly <i>off</i> environments, spaces where both familiar emotions and the uncanny could be invoked, part of a long tradition of British art where strange and ineffable goings-on intrude on the mundane world. There are still hints that Johnson still knows where his talents lie on <i>Life Has Not Finished With Me Yet</i>, but they're the faintest hints.</p></div>"|16796.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16796-life-has-not-finished-with-me-yet/|4.5|Jess Harvell

Almost all the songs he's written for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28104-the-fresh-onlys/"" target=""_blank"">the Fresh &amp; Onlys</a> are open-hearted, his sensitive songwriting and sincere vocal delivery augmenting the band's loud, often hard-charging sound. Last year's full-length <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15142-magic-trick-bad-blood-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>Magic Trick</i> and the <i>Bad Blood</i> EP</a> found him inching toward a slower, softer approach; a few of those standouts were more likely to inspire a Conway Twitty comparison than anything related to the 13th Floor Elevators. Deciding to strip his name from the banner of his solo work, he's now rechristened himself <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29813-magic-trick/"" target=""_blank"">Magic Trick</a>, after his 2011 album of the same name. But, upgraded moniker aside, is <i>Ruler of the Night</i> any better than-- or really, any different from-- the work he's released under his own name?</p>
<p>The answer is mostly yes, though there are a few signposts pointing to his songwriting past. ""Sunny"" sounds like the Fresh &amp; Onlys played on a shuffleboard deck, Cohen trading his Fender Stratocaster for an acoustic guitar and wild sparks shooting from the fretboard for the background vocals of Alicia Vanden Heuvel (also of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/37-the-aislers-set/"" target=""_blank"">Aislers Set</a>) and Noell Cahill. If the more downcast ""Weird Memory"" had been written by his other group, it's likely the guitars would've been much louder. And closer ""Say Your Name"" is comparable to the Fresh &amp; Onlys' ""I'm a Thief"", the final song on their 2010 collection <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14736-play-it-strange/"" target=""_blank""><i>Play It Strange</i></a>. It isn't quite as climactic as the older track, but it's still a satisfying way to end a record.</p>
<p>The other tracks find Cohen forging a different path. It's hard to believe any Fresh &amp; Onlys fan will listen to the ghostly, piano-led title track and claim to have seen it coming. <i>Ruler of the Night</i>'s arrangements are surprisingly experimental, contrasting with the meat-and-potatoes of his main band's most recognizable work. There's guitar squall, there are drum machines, there's an autoharp, and there's the part in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13730-invisible-at-midnight/"" target=""_blank"">""Invisible at Midnight""</a> where Heuvel and Cahill sound like an African children's choir over spirited clapping. Reverb is heavily applied on many of the songs, giving things a sleepy feel (""Next to Nothing"") or coming off like sailing through a tunnel of love with an ethereal keyboard line emerging from the other end.</p>
<p>Magic Trick's songs are about atmosphere, the feeling of the voices and howls from down the street. As a lyricist, Cohen surveys the expanse leveled by heartbreak and assesses the damage. There's nothing overly abstract here, but then, there's nothing especially specific: He falls into a kind of bland middle ground. Most of the characters in the songs are relegated to weird memories, or they're pouting in the corner and being goaded into giving the protagonist a smile. For instance, there's the four-to-the-floor intro that leads into the tender ""Ruby"", Cohen emphatically expressing that he doesn't want his intended to cry, though he doesn't offer any other alternatives. And that's the part where Magic Trick doesn't work: much of the album is placed on the shoulders of the vivid arrangements, but the songs themselves are given less meaning. Fewer generalities and a more interesting narrative would have gone a long way: For all the sharp, intriguing musical experimentation, the lyrics are too easy to forget.</p></div>"|16708.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16708-rulers-of-the-night/|6.7|Martin Douglas

On an encore of ""Angels and Fuselage"", she sounded like one of the angels welcoming Ronnie Van Zandt to rock'n'roll heaven. Still, she didn't look quite comfortable up there, and slipped unceremoniously out of sight before the song ended, as though upstaging another singer might be the most unforgivable offense imaginable.</p>
<p>That thoughtfulness, especially when coupled with such a commanding voice, is an excellent trait in a collaborator; throughout most of her career, Hogan has been an exceptional side player. After the Jody Grind's tragic split in the early 1990s, she did a brief stint playing in the Rock*a*teens (in a mostly non-vocal capacity). More recently, she's been a mainstay in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/693-neko-case/"" target=""_blank"">Neko Case</a>'s backing band and has sung with approximately everyone in the world: Mavis Staples, Andrew Williams, Amy Ray, Alejandro Escovedo, Archer Prewitt, even Silkworm. Her CV reads like the table of contents for an amazing book about the last two decades of Chicago's independent music scene.</p>
<p>By contrast, Hogan seems chronically uninterested in playing lead. Her 20-year career has yielded only four solo albums, one of which shares equal billing with the Pine Valley Cosmonauts; <i>I Like to Keep Myself in Pain</i> is her first in more than a decade. Much like 2001's <i>Because It Feel Good</i>, <i>Pain</i> is a collection of covers, revealing Hogan as-- no great surprise here-- an amazingly subtle and intuitive interpreter of others' songs and sentiments. The usual suspects are all here: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1553-freakwater/"" target=""_blank"">Freakwater</a>'s Catherine Irwin, Jon Langford, the late <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/740-vic-chesnutt/"" target=""_blank"">Vic Chesnutt</a>, and Brett and Rennie Sparks of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4804-the-handsome-family/"" target=""_blank"">the Handsome Family</a> all contributed to the tracklist. Not every song is suited for Hogan's vocals-- John Wesley Harding's ""Sleeper Awake"" gets away from her, and Matthew Stephen Ward's ""Daddy's Little Girl"" sounds dour and halting-- but most of the tracks are well chosen. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2742-stephin-merritt/"" target=""_blank"">Stephin Merritt</a>'s ""Plant White Roses"" in particular gives Hogan not only one of the album's loveliest hooks, but also one of its most bittersweet sentiments.</p>
<p>Hogan may keep herself in pain, but she never wallows. In fact, perhaps more than any of her peers, she conveys the depths of heartache with great dignity, without resorting to histrionics or theatricality. She floats through Irwin's ""Dusty Groove"", subtly suppressing a Southern accent until she gets to the climax, which she attacks like she's auditioning for a part in <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080549/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Coal Miner's Daughter</i></a>. By contrast, her take on Langford's ""Haunted"" is bright and buoyant, as though there's comfort in the painful memories of the past. She turns each of these songs into a short story, complete with character, perspective, and plot. In particular, her treatment of ""We Can't Have Nice Things"", written by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/356-andrew-bird/"" target=""_blank"">Andrew Bird</a> and Jack Pendarvis, slyly reveals new layers with each verse, turning a threadbare predicament-- a relationship built on conflict and recrimination-- into something much more complicated and real.</p>
<p>Her vocal on that song is harrowing, but the jazzy arrangement undermines rather than underscores the melancholy of a destructive relationship. And that's the sad but undeniable flaw in <i>I Like to Keep Myself in Pain</i>: Her backing band is never as attuned to the singer as the singer is to the song. It's all the more unfortunate considering the personnel: Scott Ligon of Terry Adams' Rock &amp; Roll Quartet, legendary session drummer James Gadson (Supremes, Ray Charles), Daptone exec and Dap-Kings bassist Gabe Roth, and Booker T. You almost have to laugh at that incredible line-up, but then almost cry at the shirt-and-pants accompaniment they provide, which hovers between soul, country, and pop without actually sounding like anything specific.</p>
<p>Too often the band just skims the surface rather than get their hands really dirty, while Hogan inhabits these songs deeply. They can't summon the grit to convey the dark drama of Chesnutt's ""Ways of This World"" or Robbie Fulks' ""Whenever You're Out of My Sight"", which end up sounding slick instead of soulful. It doesn't help that the backing vocals sound shoehorned into the arrangement, disruptive instead of supportive. Perhaps, much like the woman they're supporting, the backing musicians are wary of upstaging the lead. That sensitivity is respectful and respectable, but listening to <i>I Like to Keep Myself in Pain</i>, it's hard not to wonder how she'd sound with slightly less sympathetic collaborators-- with people who might push her a bit more, who might have the audacity to sound as distinctive as she does. This is a merely pleasant album, and especially after 11 long years, pleasant is a low hurdle for such an inimitable singer.</p></div>"|16710.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16710-i-like-to-keep-myself-in-pain/|6.0|Stephen M.

""A person who loves is a righteous person,"" read the supportive note, ""and if someone has the ability and desire to show love to another-- to someone willing to receive it, then for goodness' sake, let them do it."" The message was warm, thoughtful, sincere. But its presentation was just as important. It was written-out by hand, on lined paper. And there were Apple's pen marks-- a distinctive blend of print and cursive-- legible yet casual, perfect in its imperfections. The letter provided an instant reminder of the singer-songwriter's lasting appeal, why she can take six or seven years between albums and return to even-more-rabid followers. Unguarded honesty doesn't go out of style. </p>
<p class=""p1"">This is especially true in 2012, when major artists can get so caught up in ""brand management"" and web-based ""social engagement"" that the core of their art-- emotion, intelligence, meaningful connectivity-- is sometimes lost amidst bottomless scrolls. Being able to slice through the bullshit is arguably more coveted now than when Apple did just that during <a href=""http://youtu.be/GSLwYrPbuts"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">her ferocious acceptance speech at the 1997 VMAs</a>. Another famed modern truth-teller and award-show crasher (<a href=""http://www.mtv.com/bands/w/west_kanye/news_feature_081805/index2.jhtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">and noted Fiona fan</a>), Kanye West, has been able to harness technology, the media, and his own public projection by constantly negotiating with all things fresh and new. Apple doesn't really care about all that. In interviews from both 2000 and 2012, she claimed to not listen to any new music whatsoever, and when she <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8853-fiona-apple/"" target=""_blank"">recently sat down</a> with Carrie Battan for a Pitchfork interview, she referred to Google as ""this whole Google thing,"" like an overwhelmed grandmother. On her entirely acoustic fourth album, <i> The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do</i>, the 34-year-old makes herself heard with her voice, her words, her piano, and not much else.</p>
<p class=""p1"">This is the most distilled Fiona Apple album yet. While her celebrated previous work was marked by eclectic musical flourishes courtesy of producers including Jon Brion and Mike Elizondo, <i>The Idler Wheel </i>is fearlessly austere in comparison. She worked with touring drummer Charley Drayton on the album, and his touches are light and incisive. Speaking of the record's signature clattering percussion-- including thigh slaps, truck stomps, and ""pillow,"" according to the credits-- Apple associated the homemade sounds with an increased freedom: ""I just like that feeling of: 'I'm in charge, I can do whatever I want.'"" And this musique concrète approach is not random. Every single waveform is pierced with purpose, from the muted heartbeat thumping through ""Valentine"" to the childlike plinks popping around the uncharacteristically optimistic ""Anything We Want"" to the chugging factory sounds that give ""Jonathan"" its uneasy rhythm. On the oddly life-affirming <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13703-werewolf/"" target=""_blank"">""Werewolf""</a>, a banjo shows up, plucks exactly four notes, and then dips out, never to return. ""You made an island of me,"" she belts on that song, and <i>The Idler Wheel</i>'s spareness does lend it an insular loneliness, one that's divorced from the outside world while also being intimately in-tune with its basic realities. As Fiona's self-drawn album cover suggests, the inner workings of her mind can be scary, ugly, and head-splinteringly vivid.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""Werewolf"" also features the album's most jarring and powerful found-sound moment: just as the self-conscious ballad climaxes, the roar of children screaming on a playground enters, adding an uncanny mix of dread and wistfulness. The fact that Apple was inspired to insert the yells by a classic-movie battle scene that was running when she first played the song only adds to the sample's ambiguity as well as its spontaneity. Much of the album involves Apple's constant struggle between naivety and cynicism; on opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13503-every-single-night/"" target=""_blank"">""Every Single Night""</a>, she sings, ""I just wanna feel everything"" and ""every single night's a fight with my brain."" The saga can turn into lacerating theater, as on ""Regret"", which, with its mechanical beat and ominous, monk-like ambience, could nearly pass for a track on Nine Inch Nails' <i>The Downward Spiral</i>. The song also features the most brutal hook of Apple's career: ""I ran out of white doves' feathers to soak up the hot piss that comes from your mouth every time you address me,"" she bellows, tearing her throat apart in the name of pure vengeance. And while she's undoubtedly one of our foremost talents at the art of the kiss-off, the blame for Apple's woes is a bit more spread out now. ""How can I ask anyone to love me,"" she offers, ""when all I do is beg to be left alone."" </p>
<p class=""p1"">""Left Alone"" is nothing short of a vocal masterclass. It has the singer going from the verses' rap-like cadence to the hook's curlicue jazz stylings to the operatic long notes of the bridge-- notes that slowly curdle underneath their own exasperated weariness. This makes sense considering Apple is a child of Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, and hip-hop, a songwriter who's spiking the Great American Songbook with today's mirror-upon-mirror confessionalism. She's able to convey more with a quick, original turn of phrase-- ""my woes are granular,"" for one-- or an in-the-moment scrunch of the face than many pop stars are able to muster with 100-foot screens and volcano pyrotechnics.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It's an old-school approach, though it rises well above mere sepia Instagrams. Instead of being far-off and dreamy, her throwback moves are the opposite-- intrusive, corporeal. This is not background music. It demands attention. ""Look at! Look at! Look at! Look at <i>me</i>!"" she pleads on ""Daredevil"", a knowing admission of her self-destructive tendencies. But even after being thrown into the media spotlight at a young age, and having to deal with crippling doubt, Fiona Apple didn't go boom. She's still here, brave enough to indulge in raw emotion and smart enough to make those feelings carry.</p></div>"|16732.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16732-the-idler-wheel-is-wiser-than-the-driver-of-the-screw-and-whipping-cords-will-serve-you-more-than-ropes-will-ever-do/|9.0|Ryan Dombal

The received wisdom is that the German experimental pop group spent years in their studio, jamming constantly and recording everything, with bassist Holger Czukay editing the most promising tapes into the magnificent pieces that they released on record between 1969 and the mid-70s. They've always given the impression that their records were the result of grabbing whatever happened to be nearest at hand; when they've gone back into their archives for studio material in the past, they've resurfaced with outstanding stuff. <i>Unlimited Edition</i> from 1976, a collection of tapes that were lying around, includes career highlights like ""Connection"" and ""Cutaway""; <i>Delay 1968</i> is a complete, splendid album that the initial lineup of the band, with cracked American vocalist Malcolm Mooney, recorded before <i>Monster Movie</i> but somehow neglected to release until 1981.</p>
<p>For the past 30 years, though, all they've hauled up from the archive has been a few discs' worth of live material. So <i>The Lost Tapes</i> sounded like a very big deal: A 3xCD set distilled from 30 hours' worth of unissued material (spanning Can's entire original incarnation), it was assembled by Can keyboardist Irmin Schmidt and his son-in-law and frequent collaborator Jono Podmore, with the latter credited as editor. ""Halcyon days, not outtakes,"" trumpeted the album's press release. That's not entirely true. A lot of these tracks are distinctly outtakes: alternate versions of familiar themes, or at least ideas Can executed differently elsewhere. ""Dead Pigeon Suite"", for instance, is 12 minutes of what appears to be exploratory jamming toward what became the taut, densely packed single ""Vitamin C"". It's fascinating to hear once or twice if you're a Can-head, but not terribly meaningful otherwise. (The title is a reference to the German TV movie, <i>Tote Taube in der Beethovenstraße</i>, in which another version of it appears.)</p>
<p>""Messer, Scissors, Fork and Light"", similarly, is Can working out the various hooks that coalesced into ""Spoon"". Half-familiar titles turn out to be germinal variations on ""Mother Sky"", ""Soul Desert"", and ""Sing Swan Song"". ""Abra Cada Braxas"" and ""Blind Mirror Surf"" aren't the same songs as <i>Tago Mago</i>'s ""Bring Me Coffee or Tea"" and ""Aumgn"", but there's a family resemblance. There are lengthy live versions of ""Spoon"" and ""Mushroom""-- not the same as the ones that appeared on last year's <i>Tago Mago</i> reissue, but of similar vintage-- as well as ""One More Saturday Night"", which is not a Grateful Dead cover but a live take of <i>Ege Bamyasi</i>'s ""One More Night"". It's nice to hear appearances by both of Can's major singers, Mooney and Japanese hippie Damo Suzuki, although 10 minutes of Mooney chanting ""<i>are you waiting for the streetcar?!?</i>"" like a psychotic mantra is about eight too many. </p>
<p>The pity of <i>The Lost Tapes</i>' overambition is that it could easily be condensed to a single, first-rate album of genuinely new-to-record material. ""Millionenspiel"", the theme song from a 1970 suspense movie, is a terrific cut-and-paste rocker, featuring Michael Karoli slashing at a single whammy-barred chord on every downbeat and Czukay constructing a looped groove out of what sounds like amp noise. ""Barnacles"" is a disco-funk improvisation that appears to be from the late-70s period when bassist Rosko Gee had joined the group; it's the sort of thing that would have sounded as bandwagon-jumping as ""Aspectacle"" did at the time, and sounds as kickass as ""Aspectacle"" does now. And the jewel of the set is ""Graublau"", which I'm guessing comes from the sessions for Thomas Schamoni's film <i>A Big Gray-Blue Bird</i> that also yielded ""She Brings the Rain"": a thrilling suite, with Karoli shooting flames, the rest of the band in monomaniacal garage-rock mode, and Schmidt tossing shortwave-radio loops into the mix to give everyone something to attack and devour.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">One more album as good as the good stuff: It's what everyone hopes for from their favorite defunct band. Can's archives, as it turns out, were deep enough for that. But they weren't infinitely deep-- not even three albums deep. Irmin Schmidt <a href=""http://www.mtvhive.com/2012/04/18/can-the-lost-tapes/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">assessed the situation himself</a>, when he was asked a few months ago whether there would be more releases from Can's trove of unissued recordings: ""The rest is not worth putting out... That's sentimentality.""</p></div>"|16733.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16733-the-lost-tapes/|7.1|Douglas Wolk

Imagine someone's heel pressed so firmly against your forehead it begins piercing into your skin, and the uncomfortable sensation of losing yourself beneath it. This makes it even more apt that the Copenhagen punk band <a href=""http://lowercph.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lower</a> have taken the title <i>Walk on Heads </i>for their debut EP, which merges the noise and clangor of 1970s post-punk and no wave with an aggression akin to 1980s hardcore, stretching those downer feelings across eight-and-a-half all-too-short minutes. As my eyes glued themselves to that headwalker, I could hear Lower frontman Adrian Toubro shouting in the back of my mind: ""Walk on heads/ Oppress the crowd/ Throw your bones/ Into their mouths.""</p>
<p>If you clicked onto this review with even the slightest of preconceived notions about Lower, you're likely well aware that in 2012 it's impossible to have a conversation about blackened, underground punk without discussing Copenhagen. And the bands that compose that young scene are so intertwined that it's also difficult to talk about them individually without referencing the others. Lower, for example, also includes guitarist Simon Van Formann, who plays in Girlseeker with Iceage's Johan Suurballe Wieth; bassist Kristian Emdal, who plays in VÅR with Iceage's Elias Bender Rønnenfelt; and drummer Anton Rothstein, who plays in Sexdrome with VÅR's Loke Rahbek. Recently <i>NME</i> ran a feature on the Copenhagen scene, labeling it ""the new heartland of hardcore"" and ""Hottest Underground Rock Scene,"" which are at once hilarious ways of putting it and also probably quite accurate.</p>
<p><i>Walk on Heads </i>adds another dimension to the story, beginning with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13641-craver/"" target=""_blank"">""Craver""</a>, the EP's undeniable highlight. The menacing drum rolls that open the song feel almost like a rotating crank, building tension for the rocket-fire speed that's on the brink of recklessly unwinding over three following tracks. The shrill chords of ""Craver"" are barely altered throughout, instead focusing on creaking, painfully stretched walls of noise, which suffocate the vague, snarled bassline creeping underneath, delivering faint hints of an oppressed hook.</p>
<p>But what makes ""Craver"" exceptional is Toubro's lyrics, which pop like dense, ambitious poetry with gray imagery even on paper. They're spit so fast on record you can barely catch them. In a deep and air-deprived fashion, he sings about yearning for a more inspired existence, ""ignited by boredom"" within ""hermetic landscapes,"" pushed to burn holes through thick clouds to ""brighten our vision."" This is a classic punk theme, and an excellent topic for a song. There's an intrinsic urgency to it, and Toubro boils that down to an essential, oft-repeated ""craving for oxygen."" It's a visceral moment that's hard to shake.</p>
<p>And then Toubro describes a burning candle, equating its slow collapse to what sounds like death, conjuring a sense of the draining of time. ""A light is lit/ But won't shine forever,"" and later, ""A light is lit/ Soon it'll be dark again."" Part of what makes Toubro's lyrics hard to decipher sonically is his Danish inflection. To my American ears, listening to Lower can often feel like hearing music with my face pressed up to a glass window, listening in on a moment so distant it's entirely untouchable. This can heighten the allure of a record in a way that still feels genuine.</p>
<p>A similar concept to ""Craver"" is at work on ""Escape"", which plows ahead with the perpetual assault of an uptempo drum beat. In a disillusioned city, within the confines of a bleak, fluorescent-lit room, Toubro grimly shades a ""weak, faint, and pallid"" character with ""inane eyes,"" engaging in the ""fast-fix liberty"" of escapism through television. He calls it ""a self-inflected genocide,"" screaming the words violently. But again Toubro moves so rapidly you could miss it all, including his description of the ""trench"" where he remains, quarantined. There are allusions to war and combat on nearly every <i>Walk on Heads</i> track, but it turns out those references are not the EP's most startling.</p>
<p>""Pictures of Passion"" races forward on the heels of ""Craver"". It moves to a particularly curious and uncomfortable place when Toubro describes an image-- ""a relic of fascism""-- depicting passion and purity in ""machine-gun fashion."" For fans of Iceage, these lines may recall the scrutiny that band underwent last year, over misguided accusations of nationalism, which pointed at drawings from the singer's <i>Dogmeat</i> zine. The images were misinterpreted as strikes against multiculturalism in Denmark, sentiments rekindled when Toubro sings of ""[seaming] the beauty that's torn,"" stitching something back together that's been opened up. This line is followed directly by Toubro's reference to fascism and ""hierarchy in the sun,"" provoking discourse. Lower are hardly the first to appropriate this kind of imagery for shock value. In that pool you'll also find Joy Division, New Order, Death in June, Throbbing Gristle, and David Bowie.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that <i>Walk on Heads</i> is a beguiling listen, one that works the mind in a way few brief, out-of-nowhere punk EPs have managed to in recent memory. Often with scenes like the one that's emerged in Copenhagen, a band can garner value simply for being an important piece of the cultural fabric. But <i>Walk on Heads</i> more than stands its own ground, picking you open for eight minutes, fucking you up, and throwing you down, pining for more. It makes you do a double take, not only at Lower, but at the entire place from which they spawned.</p></div>"|16817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16817-walk-on-heads-ep/|8.0|Jenn Pelly

This form of non-dance dance music came as a response to an act of legislation named the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Justice_and_Public_Order_Act_1994"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Criminal Justice and Public Order Act</a>, which the UK government issued in an attempt to shut down illegal raves. ""Music"" was defined in the bill as containing ""a succession of repetitive beats,"" causing Autechre to come up with an inventive way around the issue via ""Flutter"". Whether intrepid DJs attempted to play the track to circumvent the government's plans is undocumented-- Autechre's music is hardly rave-friendly even when they're not trading in non-repetitive beats. Fast-forward to 2012 and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4591-keith-fullerton-whitman/"">Keith Fullerton Whitman</a> has pulled on a strand started by ""Flutter"" with <i>Occlusions</i>. ""Every effort has been made to avoid divisible rhythms (although mistakes are occasionally made),"" he <a href=""http://editionsmego.com/release/DeMEGO+026"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">says</a>, before describing it as ""a 'kind' of dance music"".</p>
<p>This record is Whitman's second release for <a href=""http://editionsmego.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Editions Mego</a> this year following the free-flowing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16315-generator/""><i>Generators</i></a>. Like that album, this one was recorded live, and begins with Whitman tooling away with some of the shrill electronics that emerged at the close of ""High Zero Generator"" from <i>Generators</i>. The crowd chatter that drifts across his work is another aspect that binds both Mego albums, adding a feeling of closeness that rarely surfaces in live electronic recordings. When ""Occlusion (Rue de Bitche)"" starts up it makes it easier to conjure up the scene in your head, with glasses clinking at the bar, conversations trailing to a close, attentions gradually flickering toward the stage. Both recordings here were made in February 2012, but at two separate locations at festivals in France and the Netherlands, with Whitman admitting he was ""mildly inebriated"" for the first and in a state of ""arbitrarily triggered blind rage"" for the second.</p>
<p>Those altered states clearly separate this recording from <i>Generators</i>, making it sound like Whitman took that work and fed it through a cheese-grater for 36 minutes. The gentle oscillations of ""Issue Generator (for Eliane Radigue)"" are nowhere to be found, although some of the sounds and textures deployed do orbit the same universe. ""Occlusion (Rue de Bitche)"" is Whitman hacking away at his modular set-up in the most violent way imaginable, like he's entering into battle with the machinery. It's telling that the audience is deathly quiet when a moment of calm is chopped into the track around the seven-minute mark. That might have been an aesthetic choice, with Whitman deliberately fading out the chatter after the fact, or perhaps the audience was genuinely stunned into silence. It's more fun to imagine it's the latter, because this is the kind of confrontational performance that deserves to have mouths gaping open, awe-struck by the sight of a musician so thoroughly ripping apart his own world.</p>
<p>""Occlusion (Weteringschans)"" is a continuation of that theme, blending seamlessly with the preceding track despite the shift in time and space to a new location. Here, things disintegrate even further, with Whitman's entire palette sounding so fractured that it's hard to discern whether it's man or machine in control or where it's all heading. But the lack of any clear direction is the most fascinating aspect of <i>Occlusions</i>. When each track simmers into silence, it's impossible to determine what kind of color it's going to fracture into after the break, with Whitman instead setting off on an open-ended journey with shards of electronics exploding in his face. Most of his work isn't exactly easy listening, but this album is more challenging than most. There's always a nagging feeling that a truckload of piercing, sinewy noise is about to sear your synapses, even when ""Occlusion (Weteringschans)"" settles into the kind of solid groove Whitman claims to be working against. After that moment passes and <i>Occlusions</i> is over it feels like your whole body has gone through a much needed cleanse, leaving every atom slightly rearranged in the process.</p></div>"|16794.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16794-occlusions/|6.7|Nick Neyland

Writers love to romanticize Mississippi mud and Georgia moonlight almost as much as they dig name-dropping whitewashed rednecks like Skynyrd and Duane Allman: If your singer's got a twang, or the bassist grew up South of the Mason-Dixon, your fate's been sealed. You can't blame us, though; there is something mystical about the South, something wild and eerie and alluring that outsiders can only hope to taste. When it comes to Dixie's music makers, that old Southern Gothic darkness seeps into the subconscious, and stealthily weaves its silky fingers through guitar strings and around throats. While there is surely no lack of pretenders and charlatans, bands that are both savvy and visceral enough to pull it off are rare. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30469-royal-thunder/"" target=""_blank"">Royal Thunder</a>, Atlanta's freshest sacrifice upon the twin altars of the riff and the roar, have made an admirable attempt to do just that on their first full-length. </p>
<p>Upon a cursory listen and armed with a metalhead's perspective, this fresh-faced quartet comes across like a dialed-down version of Jucifer, with none of their brutality but a far greater emphasis on clear, bewitching feminine vocals. Repeated listens, however, yield far more satisfying fruit. As with so many of the newer female-fronted doomy, rocking, bluesy bands that keep popping up, Royal Thunder's biggest asset is their vocalist. Mlny Parsonz is a nontraditional blues-rock banshee of a woman, equal parts riot grrl and gospel diva. There's a rough-hewn, unpolished charm to her delivery and phrasing, and while her arsenal of sugary whispers, angelic coos, and fiery wail serve her well, it's really her willingness to let go, dig deep, and belt it the hell on out that is her greatest strength. She's fortunate to be backed by a solid instrumental section, most notably Josh Weaver's vintage riff-wrangling, Zeppelin-esque turns, and big, retro vibes. Drummer Lee Smith and bassist Josh Coleman mesh well to provide a rock-solid base for the band's two big musical personalities without fading into the background; Smith especially goes above and beyond, infusing what could be simple rock'n'roll songs with a nice dose of understated technicality.</p>
<p>Each song follows a similar formula-- start slow and low, ease into the buildup, then unchain Parsonz's pipes and let the good times roll. ""Whispering World"" sounds like a <i>Live Through This</i>-era Courtney Love howling along to ""Kashmir"". ""No Good"" boasts a backbone of urgent, boogie woogie bar rock under a rough-edged done-me-wrong croon, while <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13723-blue/"" target=""_blank"">""Blue""</a> is an emphatic nod to old-time Southern rock, with Parsonz's vocals smoked out and layered into a sweet-voiced choir of knowing innocents. ""South of Somewhere"" is an ominous glance backward at an oncoming storm, with Parsonz summoning the rain and Weaver's muted thrumming battening down the hatches. ""Minus"" is a sad, quiet affair, more pop than anything else, while album closer ""Black Water Vision"" turns its amps up to 11 for a bombastic finale. </p>
<p>Despite the odd bout of clumsy prog and an hour-long running time, <i>CVI</i> resists its inclination to drag on and peter out; every time a song seems in danger of sagging or sinking into self-indulgence, Royal Thunder throw a curveball or trot out an inspired device to keep the train rolling. This is a solid debut album. Much of the hype is deserved, and despite what the press sheets might say about Southern doom'n'gloom, <i>CVI</i> is more bluesy, impassioned rock than anything else. It doesn't really matter how folks try to package it, though, because the album speaks for itself: What Royal Thunder are doing is only rock'n'roll, but, goddamn, do they love it.</p></div>"|16781.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16781-cvi/|7.0|Kim Kelly

<p>That distinction is reserved for <i>Express Yourself</i>, an EP that was set to come out near the end of 2011, but is just now seeing the light of day. The surprising thing about <i>Express Yourself</i> isn't the music it showcases, but the fact that it exists at all. Excepting 2009's uneven odds-and-ends compilation <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12634-decent-work-for-decent-pay/"" target=""_blank""><i>Decent Work for Decent Pay</i></a>, Diplo hasn't put out a substantial solo release showcasing his own productions since 2004's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2570-florida/"" target=""_blank""><i>Florida</i></a>.</p>
<p>Amidst the constant cacophony that surrounds Diplo's every move these days, <i>Florida</i> isn't a record frequently referenced in the context of his ever-growing body of work. That's because, like Black Dice's <i>Beaches and Canyons</i> and Liars' <i>They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top</i>, the album's stoned, 1990s-sounding multiculti soup sounds like more of a snapshot of where he was then than an indication of where he was headed. (Setting aside the fact that they both <a href=""http://vimeo.com/33995251"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">have become</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcRr-Fb5xQo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TV fixtures</a>, it also represents one of the only imaginable links between Diplo and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3581-rjd2/"" target=""_blank"">RJD2</a>.)</p>
<p><i>Express Yourself</i> is a snapshot, too, and not just because its cover art is literally a photo of the man himself crowd-surfing some locale-less Sea of Broquility. Diplo's always been as much of an ace curator as a savvy producer, and the sonic breadth of this EP represents his many genre fascinations over the past few years, along with a stuffed guest list to back up the reference points. Some of the sounds and sound-makers present: dancehall (Elephant Man), New Orleans bounce (Nicky Da B), moombahton (Billy the Gent and Long Jawns), and Canadian dubstep (Datsik). Naturally, a production duo by the name of Lazerdisk Party Sex shows up, too, and they're notable for having a hand in the EP's most sonically subtle contribution, ""Set It Off"", as well as for <a href=""http://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000002166910-swgdy6-crop.jpg?c765bfd"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this sort of funny promo picture</a>.</p>
<p>So there's a wide range of party-hardy stuff that's supposed to be represented here, right? It's actually hard to tell a lot of these sounds apart from each other. Not really an issue, though, since <i>Express Yourself</i>'s collected works aren't meant to be pondered over, analyzed, or even critically appraised. This shit is intended to be the soundtrack to fun, and listening to the individual tracks is indeed a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Color bursts from the edges of every track, and most carry no interest in subtlety or dynamic range. The production pops like a seismic charge: It goes deep and eventually explodes, so that stuff like the cross-faded vocal samples on ""Butters Theme""-- a song that could either be paying tribute to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butters_Stotch"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the much-maligned ""South Park"" character</a> or <a href=""http://butterzisthelabel.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the under-appreciated UK grime label</a>-- feel almost hallucinatory on the right pair of headphones. It should be noted, though, that thinking of <i>Express Yourself</i> as of the ""personal listening"" persuasion is kind of ridiculous, unless you're trying to put your fist through your computer monitor or re-enact the ""Express Yourself"" video on the subway, the latter of which would probably get you arrested. Best save these tunes for the house parties.</p>
<p>But why is this EP coming out now? It's not like Pentz needs a boost of self-promotion (he has <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/diplo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> for that, and he continues to use it hilariously), and <i>Express Yourself</i>'s perpetually shifting release date throughout the first half of 2012 suggested that <i>when</i> this thing came out wasn't as important as <i>if</i> it would. A decent hypothesis is that the EP's a well-deserved victory lap, since after nearly a decade of increasing omnipresence, Diplo's not only maintained relevance, but has just gotten better, more interesting, and <i>weirder</i> in the projects he chooses to be involved with and the production pies he keeps fingers in. Or: Maybe he just needed some new tunes for his next DJ set. As re-ups go, a lot of producers try a lot harder just to do a lot worse, meaning that despite Diplo's ubiquity, it's still way too easy to take him for granted.</p></div>"|16816.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16816-express-yourself/|7.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

But they seem to like him just fine. After moving in and out of the shifting layers on his first few records, bumping grooves broke through the surface on last year's <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15616-waco-taco-combo/""><i>Waco Taco Combo</i></a>. The six tracks on <i>Limbo </i>further that trend, sporting some body-moving rhythms that are practically clean and clear, at least relative to Copeland's gnarled sonic universe. This might even be his DJ album-- its sharp throbs flow together like he actually measured their BPMs beforehand.</p>
<p>At least that's the case for opener ""Double Reverse Psychology"", which sounds like a montage of ideas Copeland probably fleshed out into individual songs at some point, but decided they worked better mashed into a rubber-room dance-floor mix. Each section bounces off the other, woozily passing the beat-baton like a team of sleep-deprived relay runners. For someone prone to blurry sheets of sound, the track's sparseness-- there's often just a percussive pound and one or two other noises looping around it-- is impressively restrained, at times evoking early hip-hop reflected in a circus mirror.</p>
<p>But before you start writing rhymes to rap over <i>Limbo</i>, remember that nothing with Copeland is ever that easy. This might be his simplest album sonically, and there are some unashamedly melodic riffs coursing through it (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13664-tarzan-and-the-dizzy-devils/"" target=""_blank"">""Tarzan and the Dizzy Devils""</a> could pass for a lo-fi <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/1463-fatboy-slim/"">Fatboy Slim</a> remix), but he still displays a wobbly, sideways vision of how songs should proceed. Some loops feel hacked together in a drunken rush. Others are almost too persistent, as if the same sound repeated is a melody itself (but then, Copeland's often right about that). Not much gets smoothed out; most of the cracks and seams are out in the open. And so many moments here-- all the growls, belches, whines, cartoon blurts, garbled voices, and awkward bass plunges-- are thoroughly hilarious.</p>
<p>In fact, maybe <i>Limbo</i> marks the point at which we can officially stop tilting discussions to the brainy side of Copeland's work-- both solo and with <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"">Black Dice</a>-- and think of it as fun music first. Of course, everything here's intelligently made; Copeland's earned the right to that permanent assumption. But his music has gotten more viscerally enjoyable with every release. Springy songs like the carnival-riding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13529-louie-louie-louie/"" target=""_blank"">""Louie, Louie, Louie""</a> and ""Fiesta Muerta"", which sounds like a <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/734-the-chemical-brothers/"">Chemical Brothers</a> B-side played in a swimming pool, continue to raise that bar. Copeland may still live in a limbo of his own making, between idiosyncratic experimentalism and pop-tinged techno. But it's best to turn off those imaginary filters when you pump <i>Limbo</i>, and just let it be as entertaining as it clearly wants to be.</p></div>"|16799.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16799-limbo/|7.7|Marc Masters

An egomaniacal lech with a Jesus beard and a God complex, Tellier is a European pop curiosity whose work runs from loungey easy listening to dance-pop (his last and best album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11447-sexuality/"" target=""_blank"">Sexuality</a></i>, was produced by Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/990-daft-punk/"" target=""_blank"">Daft Punk</a>). In my cobblestone Euro-dreams he's basically a bug zapper for models and fancy drugs. In reality, he's a publicly celebrated national artiste, someone strange and finicky enough to draw constant comparisons to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4810-serge-gainsbourg/"">Serge Gainsbourg</a>, though Gainsbourg never had a corporate doppelganger as fitting as American Apparel, which sold <i>Sexuality</i> in its stores (pun intended).</p>
<p>All of this would make Tellier a particularly hairy thorn if his records weren't so sublime. Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27652-pete-doherty/"" target=""_blank"">Pete Doherty</a> or any other character whose reputation threatens to overwhelm his music, it's hard to remember that at some point Tellier sits down with a guitar, or a keyboard, or a sampler, and writes songs. More often than not, those songs are good. <i>My God Is Blue</i> is Tellier's fourth album. He still toes the line between pop and dance, this time grabbing disco's haughty string arrangements and stretching them over fun, pompous balladeering. The album is a great reminder that stoopid and stylish make great bedfellows.</p>
<p>Tellier has spit-shined a tale about how <i>Blue</i> is a reflection on dreams and, if we listen and think hard enough, it will advance our inner consciousness. His penchant for grandness and self-promotion notwithstanding, I advise against taking <i>Blue</i> quite this seriously. It's a lovely diversion, though, full of floral arrangements that cross-hatch against Tellier's breathy, competent baritone. He isn't as tuned-in musically as Gainsbourg-- who groped art-rock, funk, and reggae-- but he's similarly adept at using his force of personality to bring the best out of his collaborators. <i>Blue</i> was produced by <a href=""http://www.edbangerrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ed Banger</a> mainstay Mr. Flash, and it's easily some of the most succulent and attractive music to come out of that camp in years.</p>
<p>The productions shine, mixing taut electro rhythms with those swirling strings. There's a sense of scale to the album that is really attractive; all of <i>Blue</i>'s pianos are grand pianos. The marvelous ""Russian Attractions"" sounds like Lex Luger remixing early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4636-scott-walker/"" target=""_blank"">Scott Walker</a>; if it's not soundtracking the Criterion edition of <i>Eastern Promises</i> in 2020 I'm pocketing my $32. Lead single ""Cochon Ville"" is a busy space disco more committed than anything we've heard from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2619-lindstrom/"" target=""_blank"">Lindstrøm</a> of late (a single-only remix by fellow Parisian <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30143-brodinski/"" target=""_blank"">Brodinski</a> absolutely knocks). ""My Poseidon"" is a film score twisted into dark pop delirium. </p>
<p>Tellier navigates through this stew with a surprising grace that we can reasonably say is his finest attribute as a singer. Singing in a combination of French and English, he's warm and likeable on album opener ""Pepito Bleu"", brash and dramatic on ""Russian Attractions"", and tender on ""Draw Your World"". <i>Blue</i> is Tellier delving deep into his inner self, and it makes total sense that he would reflect that in grand, arching vistas. </p>
<p>This, of course, makes Tellier an eminently un-relatable character. When his songs sink into froth-- see the exasperating, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"" target=""_blank"">Pink Floyd</a>-by-way-of-Phil Collins album closer ""Yes, It's Possible""-- there's little to salvage. An accompanying website, <a href=""http://www.alliancebleue.com/home"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">L'Alliance Bleue</a>, purports to free minds under the musical guidance of <i>Blue</i> and exposes Tellier (again) for what he's always been: a really savvy marketer. But he's a really savvy marketer with songwriting chops and absolutely zero fear. For the most part, I'll buy what he's selling.</p></div>"|16735.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16735-my-god-is-blue/|7.1|Andrew Gaerig

I don't know what your weakness is, but my ownership of nearly every bit of recorded Cure and Smashing Pumpkins doesn't lie: If I hear a song begin with nothing more than a churning, melodic bassline and anticipatory drum rumble, I'm defenseless. In that sense, <a href=""http://www.twofiftyfour.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2:54</a> are ""my type."" The London duo's earliest singles suggested a band whose repertoire begins and ends with the Cure's ""Burn"", and even if <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13214-youre-early/"" target=""_blank"">""You're Early""</a> and <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/twofiftyfour/cold-front-7"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cold Front""</a> felt much longer on smart stylistic choices than songwriting chops, the sound was so fully formed that you could expect their confidence to truly manifest itself once they knew people were paying attention. But even with transatlantic indie titans Fiction and Fat Possum behind their debut, I'm hard-pressed to find a song that's more interesting at its three-minute mark than it is after 10 seconds: <i>2:54</i> exposes a band that knows how to make a good first impression but not a lasting one.</p>
<p>Isn't that part of their job description, though? There's nothing really unfamiliar about the smoky, gothic moods set on <i>2:54, </i>especially if you've listened to a School of Seven Bells, Ladytron, or even a Garbage record beyond the singles (and though no fault of its own, <i>2:54 </i>is actually competing with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16606-not-your-kind-of-people/"" target=""_blank"">a new Garbage record</a> in real time). They fit comfortably within the lineage of those bands whose charms are unfairly reduced to some sort of ice-queen fantasy, unerringly poised vocals all the more seductive for their congruence with steady, propulsive, and polished beats. This ignores the songcraft, ambition, or lyrical personality that distinguish any of the above from, well, bands like 2:54 whose dispassion sounds like a genetic defect rather than an artistic response to consumer culture, emotional intransigence, or unsatisfactory lovers. </p>
<p>""Revolving"" and ""You're Early"" lead off <i>2:54 </i>and maintain the promise of the group's initial singles, writhing with coiled tension and implied spiritual yearning with just enough vocal interplay between the Thurlow sisters to verify humanity behind their 10-yard stare. These are typically the kind of songs sequenced as a ramp-up to the moment of pure melodic release, but from there on out, <i>2:54 </i>sounds drained, of blood, of color, of the vitality that could jar it out of its midtempo yawn. Is it any surprise that the Cure song their additional backmasked and reverbed studio tricks are outsourced from is ""Prayers for Rain""? And even though the serpentine ""Scarlet"" has the record's most insistent melody, as someone whose previous weakness was glammed-up British rock from the 1990s, I'm more interested in deciphering whether Mansun, Space, or Spacehog used it first. It could've been all of them. </p>
<p>But as the second half trudges to beats every bit basic and interchangeable as the monomer titles, ""Scarlet"" becomes something of a highlight. Guitars drone and eddy in gray pools of dishwater; Collette and Hannah Thurlow's vocals simply nudge at their surroundings, incapable of relaying any relatable emotion, let alone enthusiasm. Forget considering the nuts and bolts of the songwriting, the cold and drab production of Rob Ellis and Alan Moulder, or the stiff melodies, and ask yourself, after hearing ""Creeping"" or ""Ride"", can you envision the Thurlow sisters leaving the studio upon their completion truly <i>excited </i>about what they just laid to tape? Can you picture a roomful of Fiction execs leaping out of their chairs upon hearing a band worthy of getting office correspondence on the same letterhead as the Cure? ""Play it cool,"" ""leave them wanting more,"" these are the sort of things you hear from huckster pickup artists, and it's often a good strategy for a band's debut, but <i>2:54 </i>ultimately makes a fine distinction between sounding effortless and sounding like you couldn't be bothered to put any actual effort in.</p></div>"|16671.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16671-254/|6.0|Ian Cohen

<p>So when I say that <i>The Warmest Place</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, the debut full-length from Australian pop singer Catherine Kelleher, who records as Catcall, feels firmly of this moment, I mean that she effectively has all these bases covered. There's a track with a mid-tempo ""L.E.S. Artistes"" chug called ""Art Star"", there's a song about not feeling lonely when you're alone (""On My Own""), and there's the obligatory dancefloor-ready song that goes ""Another bottle down, then just a little more."" But, through and through, <i>The Warmest Place</i> is so aughts-by-numbers that it already feels like a relic, frozen in a moment it can't quite transcend.</span></p>
<p>It's not hard to pick out the best song on <i>The Warmest Place</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">: It's the lead-off cut, ""August"", which gets things off to a misleadingly promising start. Sounding a little bit like a Glasser track with a harder beat, the synth-driven ""August"" drives towards its bombastic chorus, a single ""Ohhhhh"" that Kelleher holds like she's intent on blowing your house down. Though she's not a particularly distinct vocalist, she's strongest on a song like this one, aiming more for sheer power than emotional nuance, wrapping her voice around abstract monosyllables rather than chattier lyrics. If only ""August"" weren't such an anomaly.</span></p>
<p>There are far more contenders for the worst song on <i>The Warmest Place</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. It might be the grating and tasteless ""Paralysed"" (""Ooh, ooh I cannot move/ I am a-paralysed/ Aaah!"") on which Kelleher's vocal sounds so stilted and stiff that it's baiting me with all sorts of ""Paralysed"" puns that I'll respectfully let pass. Maybe it's ""Art Star"", on which Catcall lobs a couple of softball insults (""I told my girlfriends your name/ They say they've seen you and you've got no game"") that-- although they're backed by a playful, Le-Tigre-at-the-roller-disco beat-- have about as much sass as a wet noodle. (She pauses so long between each line that you start to worry that she's going to fall asleep before she reaches the end rhyme.) But the worse offense is probably the face-palmingly literal ""Swimming Pool"", on which the Euro-trash synth sunbursts are as awkwardly porny as the lyrics (""Goosebumps all over/ Nipples harden""). If hell is an American Apparel, this song plays there on loop.</span></p>
<p>It's easy to pick out Catcall's influences (the single, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13668-the-world-is-ours/"" target=""_blank"">""The World Is Ours""</a>, has a Sleigh Bells-esque chant and a cheerleader themed video, while ""I Believed""'s bassline is a dead ringer for the Gossip's ""Standing in the Way of Control""), but pastiche isn't the record's greatest crime. Instead, it's its refusal to do anything new with the reference points it wears on its sleeve. Because as tuned into the pop cultural moment as these songs are, something about the atmosphere they document feels oddly blank, devoid of the slightest lyrical texture or detail. For example, the snoozy cover of the Passions' ""I'm In Love With a German Film Star"" <span>is the vaguest imaginable meditation on flashbulbs and fame; that the titular love interest is an actor at all seems to stem from the fact that someone wanted to rhyme ""movie"" with ""it really moved me."" And ""Art Star"" is even more puzzling. Centered around the flat taunt, ""Grow up/ Grow up,"" there's nothing in the song to give it any specificity or bite: the only lyric that reveals anything about the person she's supposedly roasting is ""You're such an art star/ Uh-huh."" That the word ""art"" is uttered at all in a song this unimaginative adds an unintended layer of irony.</span></p>
<p>The thing is, there's already a song called ""Art Star"". It appeared on the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' self-released 2001 EP, and a few years later Brazilian partyrockers CSS reheated that same conceit on the goofy-but-fun ""Artbitch"" (""I only show where there's free alcohol""). Both of these songs now feel dated in their own ways: the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' track captures something of the skuzzy, neo-no wave scene in New York just moments before most of its major players got scooped up by major labels, and the CSS album that spawned ""Artbitch"" has songs called ""Meeting Paris Hilton"" and ""Let's Make Love and Listen to Death from Above."" As novel as those things might seem now, they're preserved because the artists who made them were committed to the moment they found themselves in, however garish and grimy and absurd. Though not without a few fleeting moments of campy fun, <i>The Warmest Place</i> feels mostly like a time capsule from a blank world.</p></div>"|16791.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16791-the-warmest-place/|4.3|Lindsay Zoladz

The voice belongs to Womack's mentor and friend, Sam Cooke, who <a href=""http://www.magnificentmontague.com/sounds/montague_cooke.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">spoke those words</a> of wisdom in 1963, when he was 32 years old. Cooke was murdered a year later when, acting in self-defense, a Los Angeles motel manager sent a bullet through both of his lungs and his heart. A few days after his idol's funeral, Womack began a scandalous relationship with Cooke's widow, and the two married just a few months later. Bobby was soon seen wearing Sam's clothes. </p>
<p>As all of his classic-soul peers passed on over the last 50 years, often due to bizarre or dramatic circumstances, Womack endured. It's not that he's led a cautious lifestyle; after Cooke's widow found Bobby sleeping with Sam's daughter, she shot at him, and barely missed; for 30 years, from the 1960s to the 90s, Womack was hooked on hard drugs; and more recently, he's evaded both prostate and colon cancer. As trends and sounds rolled through the R&amp;B landscape, Womack was there as a signpost of soul. The late 60s had him hollering along to Motown-style pop, and playing guitar for everyone from Dusty Springfield to Ray Charles to Elvis Presley. (""He wasn't shit,"" Womack recently told <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/may/24/bobby-womack-sing-better-before"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Guardian</i></a>, talking about the King. ""Everything he got he stole."") His most fruitful period came in the early 70s, during which he explored an intoxicating funk sound that peaked on his 1971 career best, <i>Communication</i>. There was Bobby doing coked-out disco in the late 70s, and then sanding down his grit throughout the 80s with increasingly plastic slow jams. By the 90s, he sounded a hell of a lot more like Michael Bolton than James Brown. And then he went away.</p>
<p>However foolish, thoughts of ""What if?"" have crossed the minds of many while thinking about the premature deaths of any number of soul greats. Womack provided a proxy answer to those questions, and the results weren't always pretty. But there was always that voice, a wonderfully gnarled, god-grown instrument that could turn any style into the most sincere soul, where swagger, hurt, and ecstasy got equal time. Womack sang of love and its knotted complications, and if it was sometimes hard to tell if he was making a song laugh or cry, that seemed to be the point. He's known unspeakable loss-- of his mentor, his brother, his four-month-old son-- and while he's sometimes tried to use music as an escape, that strife echoes in the crevices of his voice. At 68, he's a survivor in every sense of the word. This is not lost on him. ""I'm speaking for all those singers who gave up. Marvin, Jackie Wilson, Sam Cooke, Wilson Pickett,"" he told <i>The Guardian</i>. ""They need more respect than can ever be given to them. And I'm gonna set the record straight.""</p>
<p class=""p1"">With that in mind comes <i>The Bravest Man in the Universe</i>, an attempt to bring out the best in Womack once again, and introduce him to a new generation, by a couple of talented guys young enough to be his sons: Damon Albarn and XL Recordings owner and producer Richard Russell. This sort of arrangement has become more common in the last 15 years, whether it's Rick Rubin offering Johnny Cash a stark last act, or Jack White reigniting Loretta Lynn and Wanda Jackson, or ?uestlove helping Al Green get his funk back, or Russell himself pushing Gil Scott-Heron to complete his bittersweet final statement with 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13893-im-new-here/"" target=""_blank""><i>I'm New Here</i></a>. Oftentimes, these albums find the young producers chopping back the layers of schlock that tend to build around aging artists like garish armor, allowing their natural gifts to rise again with accompaniment that harkens back to a previous era. And while <i>The Bravest Man</i> is a skeletal affair with the spotlight keenly trained on Womack's cracked vocals, it doesn't attempt to sound like ""classic"" Bobby Womack, for better or worse.</p>
<p>The album is peppered with minimal electronics that recall the dank trip-hop of Massive Attack and the xx's spacious atmospherics. Fittingly, it's the most remorseful album of Womack's career-- an apology for his rampant drug use and womanizing, apparently written with his ex-wife Regina in mind (the two are separated but still legally married, and Womack calls her the love of his life in <a href=""http://youtu.be/P7yF8CJM1kg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a biographical TV documentary</a> from earlier this year). And while Womack's voice-- the very essence of earthy-- is not an obvious match for Albarn and Russell's synthetic, loop-based accompaniment, the pairing pays off surprisingly well on the two most wistful tracks on the album. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13293-please-forgive-my-heart/"" target=""_blank"">""Please Forgive My Heart""</a> is an open plea, where the breaks in Bobby's voice double as admissions of vulnerability. ""I'm a liar, I'm in a dream,"" he sings, ""going my way, nothing to rely on."" There's not much relief here, only the realities of looking back on a reckless life. The same goes for the nostalgic lament ""Whatever Happened to the Times"", an ambient smear of a track featuring dynamic production tweaks and instrumentation from young Warp studio wiz <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28964-kwes/"" target=""_blank"">Kwes</a>. </p>
<p>Too often, though, the album's tightly wound drums and repetitive rigidness undo Womack's spontaneity, forcing him into an unsuitably cloistered space. Many of the singer's 70s touchstone LPs had him taking his time, vamping off the cuff, or even telling stories-- just talking, basically-- for minutes on end. These techniques resulted in an intimacy between performer and listener that's hard to achieve. Unfortunately, <i>The Bravest Man</i> rarely hits a similar feeling, and while Womack does his best to step up to his alien surroundings, he can't help but sound like an out-of-place guest on his own album. Songs like the skeptical ""Stupid"", which finds Womack aiming his ire at corrupt preachers, the nearly comically flimsy ""Love Is Gonna Lift You Up"", which has the singer throwing out meaningless platitudes that go directly against the album's general darkness, and the annoyingly caustic take on the traditional song ""Jubilee (Don't Let Nobody Turn You Around)"" are open-minded experiments, but they don't connect.  </p>
<p>Which brings us back to that Sam Cooke quote about growing deeper as you get older. It's a comforting ideal. Ironically, the <i>Bravest Man</i> song that uses Cooke's observation, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13678-dayglo-reflection-ft-lana-del-rey/"" target=""_blank"">""Dayglo Reflection""</a>, is a duet between Womack and the 60s-indebted singer Lana Del Rey. When those two voices are presented together on the same track, the veracity of Cooke's koan is apparent; Womack clearly understands what he's singing about while Del Rey can only muster a projection of comprehension. The thing is, Bobby Womack has always understood: From a preternaturally young age, he's always known. ""If you get anything out of life, you gotta put up with the toils and strife,"" he sang with a sweet tenderness on 1971's <a href=""http://youtu.be/Uyt106EA9w0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""That's the Way I Feel About 'Cha""</a>, at age 27. Back then, the music understood him, too.</p></div>"|16721.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16721-the-bravest-man-in-the-universe/|6.2|Ryan Dombal

But it also stood alone as a peaceful oasis. Stripped of vocals, his beats worked almost like ambient techno, bouncing along with purpose but creating a soothing, hypnotic sensation. It was hip-hop, but somehow it <i>floated</i>, too. That ability to create atmosphere with a thumping backbone didn't go unnoticed, and Clams' profile has since risen over the past year, resulting in production work for chart-friendly rappers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30111-mac-miller/"" target=""_blank"">Mac Miller</a> and helped define <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a>'s kicked-back, drug-laced aesthetic.</p>
<p>Clams faces a little more of a challenge with <i>Instrumental Mixtape 2</i>. We're familiar with his style now, and that initial ""wow"" factor has worn off some. And while the beats on the first tape were unquestionably strong, many of them supported stream-of-consciousness <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28900-lil-b/"" target=""_blank"">Lil B</a> raps which, no disrespect to the Based God, most people didn't mind leaving behind. Now that he's making beats for songs with more memorable hooks and verses, do Clams' productions work as well on their own? The short answer is yes, and you don't have to look further than the opening cut for proof. The beat for A$AP Rocky's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12731-palace/"" target=""_blank"">""Palace""</a> is pretty glorious by itself, with a natural arc that moves from collapsing drums to a coda of soaring, disembodied vocals. But even without Rocky's indelible hook, it feels whole.</p>
<p>It's worth considering why these tracks, and not other producers', are able to function so well independently. It's not that Clams is hip-hop's most talented beatmaker. There are plenty of guys, from Hit-Boy to Lex Luger to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29765-araabmuzik/"" target=""_blank"">AraabMuzik</a>, who can match or exceed his ability. What makes him unique is that he fills in all the spaces that other guys tend to leave open for MCs to rap over. Luger's ""H.A.M."" beat (highly unofficial version <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLb_K26vLvQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>), for example, is a thrilling piece of production, but the gaps where Jay and Kanye are supposed to come in feel empty. But that's not the case with something like ""Wassup"", which comes pre-loaded with its own embellishments: The layers of ambient hiss, the skittering drum track, and those cooing, clipped voices all bleed together in such a way that invites a rapper but doesn't require one.</p>
<p>Clams' talent for making an instrumental more than just an instrumental is his ace in the hole, and it's what makes this mixtape nearly as enjoyable as the first installment. There are plenty of examples of the classic Clams sound, that buoyant, medicated drift. But the album gets really interesting in the back half, which is more varied and includes some non-rap remixes. You've got the Lana Del Rey rework, which deconstructs the original to the point that it's no longer recognizable, and a beat for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30154-squadda-b/"" target=""_blank"">Squadda B</a>'s ""Kissing on My Syrup"" that's more aggressive than we're used to from him, a sort of chugging space-station boom-bap. These are the moments when Clams' talent is most encouraging, because it feels like his ideas are still germinating. For a guy with this kind of potential, not only for contract beatmaking but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15416-rainforest-ep/"" target=""_blank"">his own material</a>, it affirms that we should be in for a nice, long ride.</p></div>"|16798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16798-instrumental-tape-2/|7.9|Joe Colly

But, in retrospect, the timing was brilliant. Though unknown outside of Montreal, the fledgiing band had already <a href=""http://twitter.com/best_coast/status/12091907929"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">made an enthusiastic fan out of indie rock's most voracious Tweeter</a>, Best Coast's Bethany Cosentino, whose band was just then starting to pop up on year-end best-of lists for their own 2010 debut. By January 2011, Best Coast had parlayed their critical buzz into theatre-headliner status, accruing enough clout to bring their Montreal mates on tour as their hand-picked opener, and introducing them to large Stateside audiences mere weeks after their album's release.</p>
<p>The instant mutual-admiration society made total sense: in their infancy, both Best Coast and No Joy exhibited a fondness for swooning melodies, and an equal affinity for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrHlNbcYlBg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">obliterating them in a hurriance of fuzz and reverb</a>. But since their 2011 tour, the bands have followed markedly divergent paths: while Best Coast followed <i>Crazy for You</i> by hiring Jon Brion to turn them into <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlYwI_9iSPA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the world's youngest dad-rock band</a>, No Joy have answered their own debut's promise by receding even deeper into the murk. If <i>Ghost Blonde</i> owed a considerable debt to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pZRfsBYsXw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the pedal-stomping squall of late-80s My Bloody Valentine</a>, <i>Negaverse</i> sees them adopting MBV's release strategies as well, in the form of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Made_Me_Realise"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a five-song EP</a> that feels less like a random collection of leftovers than a stand-alone mini-album of complementary tracks.</p>
<p><i>Negaverse</i> marks an evolution from <i>Ghost Blonde</i>, though not in ways you'd necessarily expect. In concert, that album's hazy-headed distort-pop was given a muscular makeover worthy of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi1LrNtVltg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SST-era Dinosaur Jr</a>. <i>Negaverse</i>, however, deemphasizes the band's live presence by highlighting both the intimacy and intricacy of their songcraft; this is a record that feels demo-quality crude yet sonically dense and deliberate at the same time.</p>
<p>Opener ""Junior"" provides a logical leap-off from <i>Ghost Blonde</i>, its airy melody and wordless harmonies hitched to a double-time drum stomp that, thanks to the unyielding corrosiveness of Jasamine White-Gluz and Laura Lloyd's guitars, still feels like it's moving in slow motion. But even when working within <i>Negaverse</i>'s downsized dimensions, No Joy seem eager to reveal that there's more to their music than a simple noise/pop dichotomy: ""Shame Cave"" is another trash-can-thwacking Mary Chained rave-up, but one where the drums drop out in its final minute, transforming the song's reverberating guitar line and backing harmonies into a slow-dissolving swirl; ""Smiley Face"" takes a good half of its 3:35 runtime pulling back the slingshot before unleashing a space-bound robo-cow-punk rampage. And if <i>Negaverse</i>'s proudly washed-out sound still provides little clue as to what White-Gluz is going on about, the enchantingly whispered ""Yang Sanpanku"" still manages to sculpt a dramatic arc out of what at first seems like a monolithic, buzz-killing drone; it's a song that sounds anthemic even if it lacks the basic lyrical intelligibility required of a proper anthem. Packing five songs into 15 minutes, <i>Negaverse</i> goes by in a blur-- but what impresses most is its sense of patience.</p></div>"|16792.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16792-negaverse/|6.9|Stuart Berman

""V"", or the album's fifth track, twinkles open, its muted guitar riff offering the calm before the surge: ""I am not alone now/  You're lying next to me,"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/8799-vision-quests/"" target=""_blank"">Chris Black</a> starts over a sudden quake of drums and distortion, his voice dependent upon the same extent of entreaty that Jon Bon Jovi used at the prime of his popularity. The chorus opens like floodgates, with Black's arc hitting a fists-up, eyes-closed, mouths-open peak like never before. But that chorus, if you can call it that, appears only once, ceding its time instead to two long, rapturous guitar solos, meaning that Dawnbringer trades maudlin, lighters-up cheese for undeniable fireworks here. To be honest, it's completely awesome.  </p>
<p>That melodramatic epic serves as the midpoint for <i>Into the Lair of the Sun God</i>, a holistically designed concept album built upon the tale of an ill-fated warrior who has succeeded in battle but still feels void of real merit. He longs to be a leader, praised in song and recognized as a hero. It all goes wrong at the album's start, when he begins to not only hear voices but to believe them-- namely, that of the sun, who taunts him as a simple if bold man who should just go home and live his humdrum life. So, he gets mad and brands himself ""killer warrior, assassin of the sun."" That's right: He wants to kill the sun. </p>
<p>Above the mighty thrash of ""II"", he vows to turn his anger into immortal fable: ""Now my story starts/ Coming toward you/ Your ending has begun,"" Black shouts. The bile in his voice is mirrored perfectly by the band's confident romp, a text of would-be heroism painted perfectly by music of complete conquest. That lyrical and musical synergy is constant throughout <i>Sun God</i>, meaning that the composite parts are all complementary. When the ghosts of people the warrior has held dear tell him they'll show him the path to the sun's lair during ""VI"", Dawnbringer revert to a thirst for triumph, bass and drums cracking ahead with militaristic precision. With the warrior's conviction restored, the song ends with a dancing organ solo-- delightful and unexpected, a glowing arrow pointing the protagonist toward victory. One track later, when he awakes ""on a shore of shadows,"" wondering where he is and what he's meant to do, the music creeps forward before exploding when he realizes he's footsteps away fom his victim, destiny, and glory. You can almost see the gleam in his eye within Black's resolute voice.</p>
<p>If all of this sounds a bit ridiculous, it is. Like the heavy-metal titans upon which Dawnbringer build their sound, <i>Sun God</i> is an unapologetic, all-or-nothing proposal. It's committed to its Bulfinch-worthy story, its NWOBHM-aligned sound, and its seamless fusion of the two. But it's also enjoyably silly. Sure, this is a serious fable about being hoisted with one's own petard and being ruined by vaulting ambition. It's also an album that keys on generations of metal bands who succeeded because they were happy to look, sound, and be melodramatic in order to make good records.</p>
<p>Black's played pivotal roles in a number of different metal acts and outlets over the last two decades, from evil tweakers Nachtmystium to classic blasters High Spirits, from record label head to journalist and critic. As he said in <a href=""http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2010/12/interview-dawnbringer/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a 2010 interview</a>, ""Dawnbringer is kind of a respite from everything else that I'm doing... There's a playfulness that I can get away with, especially musically."" <i>Into the Lair of the Sun God</i> succeeds exactly because of that commitment. After all, for the first time ever, Black (mostly) returned with the same crew he employed on 2010's <i>Nucleus</i>: producer Sanford Parker, guitarists Bill Palko and Scott Hoffman, and the record label Profound Lore. Two years ago, they were good, if a bit all over the map as a unit. This time, they have a script to stick with, a story to share.

We're barely at the backend of the last 1980s revival, kickstarted around the time <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3529-the-rapture/"">the Rapture</a> arrived in New York City and channeled the dormant influence of some of the city's musical forebears (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2494-liquid-liquid/"">Liquid Liquid</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7812-esg/"">ESG</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/9486-tom-tom-club/"">Tom Tom Club</a>) on their now-seminal ""House of Jealous Lovers"" single. Over 20 years passed between Liquid Liquid's debut EP for 99 Records and the release of that Rapture single on <a href=""http://www.dfarecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DFA</a> in 2002. Now, a decade later, Brooklyn-based five-piece <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30016-friends/"">Friends</a> have sprung from the city's DIY scene, carrying a sound carved from the same touchstones that inspired the dance-punk movement. There are times when this debut covers itself in other decorative markings, but it primarily feeds off a strand of New York's past that's perilously close to being bled dry.</p>
<p>Initially, it felt like Friends could batter such concerns into the ground through the sheer force of personality of the band's singer, Samantha Urbani. The 2011 single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1519-im-his-girl/"">""I'm His Girl""</a> was a hook-laden, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWsRz3TJDEY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Buffalo Stance""</a>-style calling card, based around a cyclical lyric offering a defiantly female take on open relationships. When it appears on this record, it leaps out as Friends' defining moment, a chance for them to rise above the low-bar scene they're a part of to connect with a wider audience. As such, ""I'm His Girl"" was reasonably successful, although the drop-off between that song and the rest of <i>Manifest!</i> is sizeable. There's a palpable sense that this is a band struggling to define itself, apparently strangled by the too-cool reference points they seem hell-bent on shoehorning into their songs. It's sloppily played-- perhaps deliberately so-- and Urbani takes more of a back seat, apparently content to trade in snatched phrases that sound good but offer little depth.</p>
<p>In a sense, <i>Manifest!</i> is the logical endgame that occurs when a set of influences end up being thoroughly drained of their life force. When Friends dig into the percussion-heavy ""Sorry"" it comes out of the wash as the bloodless cousin to Liquid Liquid's similarly constructed <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9lDBTCuJeg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Optimo""</a>. The latter contains a valuable lesson: If you're going to strip songs down to rudimentary elements, where there's not much going on other than bass, percussion, and vocals, those things need to be doing something really inspired for it to work. Here, everything feels too calculated to reach a point of true inspiration. When Friends attempt to assimilate 70s funk influences on the leaden ""Mind Control"", it feels like they're over-thinking the idea of having a good time instead of truly getting lost in the moment. </p>
<p>Friends' slavish adherence to hip makes the ""party"" songs here particularly trying, ultimately severing them of the looseness they need to work and actually flipping their studied-cool façade on its head. The sense of deliberation in the ESG-referencing ""Home"" and the hapless <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29394-chic/"">Chic</a>-lite groove of ""Va Fan Gör Du"" makes it feel like someone's dad just entered the room, bathed in bad cologne, desperately trying to get everyone on their feet. Elsewhere, <i>Manifest!</i> heads off in cynical pursuit of eclecticism, becoming a simple piece of tasteful indie box-ticking devoid of much character or life of its own. So we get the ghostly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"">Zola Jesus</a> electronics of ""A Light"", Urbani channeling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=yeah+yeah+yeahs"">Karen O</a> on ""Ruins"", and a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=cocteau+twins"">Cocteau Twins</a> pastiche on ""Stay Dreaming"". Genre hopping is fine if you've got definable traits as a band to tie everything together, but Friends are simply wandering through their record collections, either unwilling or unable to assert themselves amid all the second-guessing. </p>
<p>That reticence is the primary failing of <i>Manifest!,</i> causing it to come off as a curiously empty experience. ""I'm His Girl"" was derivative, but it possessed a memorable vocal line and a catchy melody to latch onto. The bulk of this album is curiously devoid of these qualities, ending up as a surface-level skim across a set of styles extracted from perennially fashionable artists. Friends try really hard to make sure their influences are all immaculately selected, but they don't try hard enough to get to the crux of what made that music work so well in the first place. There's a lack of thought and care, a feeling that this band is still figuring out what it wants to be while not treading on too many toes in the process. ""I'm His Girl"" gave Friends a ticket out of the ever-decreasing circles of the Brooklyn indie scene, but <i>Manifest!</i> suggests they're short of ideas on how to take the next step.</p></div>"|16837.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16837-manifest/|5.2|Nick Neyland

Though he was only in elementary school at the time, the rapper/producer's no-fi mixtapes have largely sounded like bedroom transmissions from an especially creative kid paying tribute to this era with only the crudest computer technology.</p>
<p>But SpaceGhostPurrp is more about re-imagination than revival. Most of the tracks on his latest release, <i>Mysterious Phonk</i>, are previously released on some form, but now that he shares a label with Bon Iver and Deerhunter, you can hear ""Grind on Me"", ""Been Fweago"", and the ""sequel"" to ""Suck a Dick for 2011"" rendered with high-grade fidelity, giving listeners their best chance to judge for themselves whether SpaceGhostPurrp is for real.</p>
<p>SpaceGhostPurrp owns his niche, and one consequence of this is that the predominant atmosphere on the record is isolation: SGP's voice is the only one on the record, and all of the beats are his. The increase in production values allows you to hear how each element mirrors the other. The voice and production are slow, simple, and enunciated with a menacing calm, yet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13436-bringing-tha-phonk-2012/"" target=""_blank"">""Bringing the Phonk""</a> and ""Get Yah Head Bust"" demonstrate his ability to diversify within his narrow range of tempo and timbre, ramping up rhythmic activity and intensity with metallic snares and modem-like buzz.</p>
<p>Purrp's near-subliminal, ultimately utilitarian rapping recalls non-MC rappers like Tricky more than similarly-minded peers like A$AP Rocky or Main Attrakionz, but while <i>Maxinquaye</i> spoke to more imposing paranoia (of the government, of the oncoming millennium, of creeping schizophrenia), <i>Mysterious Phonk</i> projects an acceptance of lonerhood. Even so, SGP's ability to create a quarantined universe explains why <i>Mysterious </i>is often absorbing rather than oppressive. His P.O.V. has a teenaged sort of magnetism: drugs are consumed as a means of combating boredom rather than expanding one's mind. Self-worth is determined by one's ability to satisfy women sexually. The worth of others is assessed on loyalty and trust, and the morality of the world broken is down into a tacit ""us against them"" dynamic.</p>
<p>It might be difficult to hear music this grimly colored as being youthful even though he's prone to lines like ""I hate this fucking world/ Y'all can suck my dick"" as a mission statement or ""Taking out my anger/ Your body in danger"" as a come-on. And yet, there's something oddly wizened about <i>Mysterious Phonk. </i>The album reflects the resigned tone of a self-identifying nerd who merely tolerates institutions like school and jobs until he can escape into comic books, video games, and hip-hop CDs.</p>
<p>Inititally, the record<i> </i>may seem almost intimidating in its cohesiveness-- its 14 tracks achieve mostly the same effect in slightly different ways. But even if these tracks aren't familiar to you from previous mixtapes, each asserts itself largely with same qualities that have defined 4AD's roster since the beginning: mesmerizing use of reverb and negative space, hooks derived from the phonetic and rhythmic qualities of words rather than their meaning, constructions of alternate realities.</p>
<p>The video for ""Tha Black God"" is a perfect visualization of <i>Mysterious Phonk</i>'s universe,<i> </i>a grayscale vision of 90s gangsta tropes, combining the codeine-sipping pace of Southern rap, New York's subzero bleakness, and the overarching vulgarity that's come to define the hip-hop of his home state of Florida. There's never a track where all three of these factors aren't present, but <i>Mysterious Phonk</i>' range comes from skewing that ratio: the coiled intensity of ""Osiris of the East"" exists somewhere between <i>Hell on Earth</i> and <i>Hell Hath No Fury</i>, whereas ""Suck a Dick 2012"" and ""Grind on Me"" could pass for extremely defiled versions of bump and grind R&amp;B from the <i>That's My Jam </i>collection. While some might find issue with the limitations of Purrp's rapping, the sentiments of standouts like ""Tha Black God"" (""I got to have the world in my palms/ I'm a god, I'm no longer a black man"") and ""Grind on Me"" (""Grind on me/ I got your bitch on my dick, bitch"") sound perfectly reasonable placed back-to-back.</p>
<p>Even with its almost total divergence from commercial viability, the most forbidding aspect of <i>Mysterious Phonk </i>is how it imports the misogyny of its influences wholesale. SpaceGhostPurrp's self-preservative RVIDXR KLVN philosophies can result in feasibly admirable, backhanded wisdom about safe sexual practices, and the worship of the female form. But while women are often anointed as ""goddesses"" on <i>Mysterious Phonk</i>, they're referred to as ""bitch"" about 10 times as often. And whereas ""Suck a Dick 2012"" could conceivably be read as a pre-civilized, utopian vision of sexual freedom, lyrics like ""open up your mouth, bitch and swallow it"" are more indicative of the fact that you're listening to a song called ""Suck a Dick 2012"".</p>
<p>Of course, all of the above makes the same point about SpaceGhostPurrp one way or another, and that's that <i>Mysterious Phonk</i> is not for everyone. This is ultimately a good thing. While it doesn't sound like a revelation (or a revolution) in the same way Death Grips' <i>The Money Store</i>, Tyler, The Creator's <i>Goblin</i>, or Shabazz Palaces' <i>Black Up </i>do, it's still heartening to see atypical hip-hop benefactors acting out of belief in the weirdest, unprecedented mutations of hip-hop rather than desperation for the lowest common denominator or a bygone eras. A rapper doesn't have to be everything to everyone at once. And if you happen to be on SpaceGhostPurrp's wavelength, there's pretty much nothing else that will suffice.<i></i></p></div>"|16716.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16716-mysterious-phonk-the-chronicles-of-spaceghostpurrp/|8.0|Ian Cohen

For devotees of bandleader Kevin Rowland-- and there are many, despite the last <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1189-dexys-midnight-runners/"" target=""_blank"">Dexys</a> album having come out 27 years ago-- this is exactly what they've been hoping to hear. For anyone else, an hour in Rowland's company will be more of an effort, though probably one worth making. The new record picks up where 1985's <i>Don't Stand Me Down</i> left off. That album was a commercial disaster that became a cult favorite for its emotional complexity and its formal daring, as tracks cut mid-song into long conversations between Rowland and bandmates. Some of these were awkwardly revealing chit-chat, some statements of belief. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1189-dexys-midnight-runners/"" target=""_blank"">Dexys Midnight Runners</a>, as they were known in the 80s, always had a reputation for passion and honesty, but there was an uncomfortable intimacy about the <i>Don't Stand Me Down</i> work which made it their most difficult but gripping record.</p>
<p>The passion returns in the comeback; more measured than before, at its best when burning slowly on ""She Got a Wiggle"" or ""I'm Thinking of You"". The dialogues are back, too: The middle of the record sees Rowland chase and discard co-vocalist Madeleine Hyland. And the honesty and intimacy return unaltered. Utterly unaltered: Rowland at 58 is as perpetually unsatisfied and self-doubting as he was at 31, and just as frank about his hopeless inability to make relationships work. He remains one of pop's great flagellants, with each new song flaying a layer of skin from the last one. He starts the album thoughtful and lonely, turns lustful, then romantic, then reveals that he never meant it, then agonises over not meaning it, then celebrates the fact that he doesn't, and finally ends up meditative again-- deciding, essentially, that he is what he is and it's not likely to change.</p>
<p>The big questions for the listener, then, are: Does Kevin Rowland have anything interesting to say about love, infatuation, or commitment to people who aren't Kevin Rowland? And does he say it well? The answer to the second question is an emphatic yes: Rowland himself is in terrific form here. His voice has lost some of its rougher edges-- he barks and yelps less-- and if he sounds more weathered he also sounds richer: he sells the melancholy on opener ""Now"" and closer ""It's OK, John Joe"" perfectly. He has several shades of monologue to choose from-- pinched and self-mocking on ""I'm Thinking of You"", humble and sincere nearer the end. On ""You"" he tags barbed emphases on the end of his lines like Dylan in the 1960s. On ""Me"" he undermines his band's meandering supper-club soul with whispers of ""Is this it?"" and ""What the fuck happened?"" Said band is tight and unobtrusive throughout; this isn't a record you'll return to for its hooks, and the production can feel rather flat, but their job is to color Rowland's moods and self-revelations, and they do it well.</p>
<p>Which means that, as with any confessional record, <i>One Day I'm Going to Soar</i> ends up relying on how fascinating you find its lead character. Very few rock stars have ever been as willing to dismantle themselves in song as Kevin Rowland. But it's also true that his themes here-- lack of commitment, inability to love-- are well-trodden. His insights, like ""why would I want to buy a book when I could join the library?"" are the kind of things men in their melodramatic 20s or bitter 40s have always said. The crux of the record is the deliciously awkward moment on ""I'm Always Going to Love You"" where the lumbering disco stops and Rowland admits to Hyland that he's made a dreadful mistake. It shows that his sense of theater and comic timing hasn't faded. But the emotional meat of the songs which immediately follow isn't much more than an extended ""It's not you, it's me.""</p>
<p><i>One Day I'm Going to Soar</i> is an idiosyncratic, brave record, and nobody else is likely to make one much like it. It's sharp, thought-out down to the briefest note, and, astonishingly given the 27 year gap, it fits naturally into the Dexys story. But the fans who'll get the most from it emotionally will be those who are already invested in its singer and his honesty.</p></div>"|16686.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16686-one-day-im-going-to-soar/|6.7|Tom Ewing

As it turns out, he does quite a bit of both: In addition to handling kit duties for the angular electro-pop outfit <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29595-whomadewho/"" target=""_blank"">WhoMadeWho</a>, Barfod's been knob-twiddling for the past decade and change, both on his own and with fellow Danish countryman <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28637-kasper-bjrke/"" target=""_blank"">Kasper Bjørke</a> as Filur.</p>
<p>His new solo album, <i>Salton Sea</i>, finds him tightrope-walking the increasingly smaller gap between man and machine. Drum programming shares space with the organic, individual physicality that comes with being a percussionist; one moment there's a thick, fuzzy backbeat rubbing against your ears, and the next you might be grooving to what sounds like crisp cymbals and snares, controlled by a flesh-and-blood metronomic instinct. The album sounds handmade in every sense of the word, possessing a sense of intimacy even at its grandest moments.</p>
<p>A word about WhoMadeWho: The trio released four albums (the most recent being this year's solid, overlooked Kompakt collection <i>Brighter</i>), each possessing a loose, in-the-studio charm where mechanized ballads share equal billing with, say, a snarling post-punk cover of Benny Benassi's macho-electro anthem <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPtQ4K-evBo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Satisfaction""</a>. There's nothing quite as cheeky on <i>Salton Sea</i>, but a sense of homespun playfulness is definitely present, as Barfod hops from <a href=""http://www.morrmusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Morr Music</a>-esque music-box glitch pop (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13700-broken-glass-young-l-remix/"" target=""_blank"">""Broken Glass""</a>) to sweeping spacey electro (""Python"") to tense, hair-raising house (""Till We Die"") with a wide-eyed confidence.</p>
<p>That confidence is bolstered by Barfod's indulgent generosity, since <i>Salton Sea</i> runs long, with only three cuts finishing below the five-minute point and a total running time that cracks an hour in length. Look past the occasional bloat, though, and you'll find that another important lesson Barfod's taken away from playing in a relatively pop-focused band is a sense of pacing. The record's A-B-A-B sequencing (vocal cut, instrumental, vocal cut, instrumental) lends it a nice perpetual swelling motion.</p>
<p>The album's pop-leaning sparklers are its clearest highlights, perfectly constructed as proper songs. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13563-november-skies-ft-nina-kinert/"" target=""_blank"">""November Skies""</a> is a heady rush of a tune that, thanks to a perpetually aerial vocal from Swedish singer Nina Kinert, crests on a steady, gauzy lightness while maintaining enough weight that it doesn't float away. WhoMadeWho guitarist Jeppe Kjellberg provides the wizened voice that gets twisted and spat out on ""Broken Glass"", but it's his vocal take on ""Don't Understand"" that makes for the album's most surprising moment, when his fragile falsetto hits six disco spins on the way down from the song's disorienting climactic burst. The record's most oblong instrumental cuts make similar use of building and breaking tension-- ""Aether"" especially, as its clanging swarm of synth noise dissolves into a diorama foregrounded by welcome emptiness-- but they just don't stick to the brain as well as the vocal showcases, both due to a comparative lack of melodic hookiness and, in the case of opener ""D.S.O.Y."", Barfod's occasional tendency to create tracks that are simply content to spin in place.</p>
<p>In form and execution, <i>Salton Sea</i> reminds me of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3611-royksopp/"" target=""_blank"">Röyksopp</a>'s excellent 2009 album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12860-junior/"" target=""_blank""><i>Junior</i></a>, in that both combine grand, pop-centered gestures with a sense of futuristic fussiness. Of course, they're not <i>totally</i> alike; for one, even at his most accessible moments, Barfod's not close to touching the highest highs of that impeccable Norwegian pair. <i>Junior</i> was also a specifically clubby album, even if the club most suited for its pleasures is probably located somewhere on Saturn. Despite a strong emphasis of the form, save for the track ""Came to Party"", I'm not sure it'd be totally appropriate to refer to <i>Salton Sea</i> as a ""dance"" album. It certainly grooves in its own special way, but it's hard to imagine a lot of this stuff as going-out music, let alone the type of tunes you'd work up a sweat to. As a solo artist, Tomas Barfod's a few steps away from achieving sweet and total bliss, but <i>Salton Sea</i> is plenty evidence that every step taken in the future will be worth documenting.</p></div>"|16790.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16790-salton-sea/|7.2|Larry Fitzmaurice

Decidedly unlike most people, however, he remedied this by building one himself. Throwing some rudimentary recording equipment in his backpack, he visited a handful of musician friends in their homes, re-recording them as they played dozens of parts, and then mixed the painstakingly assembled piecemeal results into the majestic 70-piece outfit he could never afford during mixing. Listening to <i>Composed</i> with this task in mind is like imagining someone filling an Olympic-sized pool with an eye dropper: the mind balks, both at the enormity of the undertaking and at the disposition of the person behind it.</p>
<p><i>Composed </i>had to get made. But you would have gathered this from the album's first six minutes without a shred of context anyway: Opening with a gorgeously sobbing piece of string writing reminiscent of Samuel Barber's ""Adagio For Strings"" as fanfare, the orchestra slides into a groove, tropical and breezy. And then who should wander into view but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/525-david-byrne/"" target=""_blank"">David Byrne</a>, in loosened-tie, silver-fox mode, crooning a quizzical love song to the disparate parts of his beloved's face. Not bad for an opening number.</p>
<p><i>Composed</i> is a succession of these head-turning walk-ons. No sooner has Byrne ambled offstage than Tropicália legend <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4466-caetano-veloso/"" target=""_blank"">Caetano Veloso</a> has sauntered on, for ""The Secret of the Machines"", stepping lightly with his reedy voice over an orchestral landscape that veers from Disney rainbows to a moat filled with snapping jaws. Greg Saunier of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1048-deerhoof/"" target=""_blank"">Deerhoof</a> appears on <i>Composed</i> also, as do <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/778-nels-cline/"" target=""_blank"">Nels Cline</a>, Craig Wedren of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3776-shudder-to-think/"" target=""_blank"">Shudder to Think</a>, and many others. It's an ensemble affair. Folk singer Dawn McCarthy drops by to sing a cheery number titled ""Insomnia, Death and the Sea"". Each artist contributed their own lyrics to Bischoff's compositions, lending the album the feel of a busy, semi-staged opera.</p>
<p>Bischoff arranges the songs around his guests like thick little jungles, symphonic interludes sprouting like overgrowth. On the surface, <i>Composed</i> feels like a successor to records like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13078-veckatimest/"" target=""_blank"">Grizzly Bear's <i>Veckatimest</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12985-actor/"" target=""_blank"">St. Vincent's <i>Actor</i></a>, chamber-pop records that drip with ornament. But it's to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8485-van-dyke-parks/"" target=""_blank"">Van Dyke Parks</a>, the granddaddy of unclassifiable, absurdly ambitious art-song cycles, that <i>Composed</i> owes the most. Like Parks, Bischoff's music swims around in a deep pool of references: a bassoon pops up, in ""Secret of the Machines"", quoting the opening of <i>The Rite of Spring</i>, and ragtime, bossa nova, and more flit airily through the arrangements. ""Young and Lovely"", featuring Zac Pennington of Bischoff's former band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4824-parenthetical-girls/"" target=""_blank"">Parenthetical Girls</a>, indulges in a broad, slurpy cabaret melody for its chorus that feels like Parks reincarnate.</p>
<p>If <i>Composed</i> doesn't resonate as deeply as it should, this debt might be part of the reason. Bischoff is a hugely talented composer, with sky-high ambitions. He is also still in the process of announcing his voice. Many of the big ideas on <i>Composed</i> still feel borrowed, from Parks and from others, but you can hear Bischoff busily whittling away at their edges so that he can eventually own them.

A rolling stone gathers no moss, after all, and once this Portland quartet finally got moving, they kicked right into high gear, and haven't slowed down since. 2011's <i>South of Salem</i> seemingly came out of nowhere; it took critics and doomhounds alike by surprise, and launched the band into the spotlight. Witch Mountain's name began to pop up all over the place-- at Scion shows, in rave reviews, upon Adult Swim compilations, on tour dates with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/18530-wino/"" target=""_blank"">Wino</a>'s Premonition 13-- and a record deal with tastemakers Profound Lore soon arrived to sweeten their success. Now, with <i>Cauldron of the Wild</i>, they are doing their damndest to capitalize on that buzz, and ride the waves of positive energy as far as they'll go. Luckily for them, and for us too, their new album is more than worth the trip.</p>
<p>The band as a whole is impressively talented, and each member more than pulls his or her weight, but the vocals in particular are an unavoidable and entrancing highlight. Uta Plotkin's voice should be declared a national treasure, of the doomed nation if not the whole damn American music scene. Bluesy, ballsy, sensual, and commanding, this lady's powerful pipes make this band what it is, and when she chooses to exercise the fullness of her dizzyingly elastic range (as in, for example, her rumbling death growls on ""Veil of the Forgotten""), the result is electrifying. In turns haunting and brash, Plotkin's voice and phrasing bring her strange, otherwordly lyrics to life, whether the pictures she paints depict a murderous girl child, a deadly fever, or a faraway love. On 12-minute slow burner <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13621-aurelia/"" target=""_blank"">""Aurelia""</a>, the instrumentals back off, and give her space to breathe, which she deftly uses to showcase a sweet, more delicate side of her usually smoky delivery.</p>
<p>One mustn't forget, though, that at its core, this is doom metal. Main guitarist Rob Wrong's Black Sabbath meets Hendrix wearing a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22761-st-vitus/"" target=""_blank"">Saint Vitus</a> shirt vibe and fuzzed-out approach couldn't be more perfect for this style of music. The mind-melting solo that spirals through the first 45 seconds of ""Shelter"" and reappears throughout says it all, really (and come to think of it Uta's whispering about ""glittering shrapnel"" sums her up pretty well, too). Plotkin's voice may be Witch Mountain's heart, but Wrong's guitar leads and magic fingers give them soul. Not to be outdone, new bassist Neal Munson holds down the low end admirably and adeptly, and drummer Nate Carson keeps it all together, hitting harder than ever and providing an axis for Plotkin and Wrong to vamp around. ""Solid"" doesn't begin to describe this record.</p>
<p>Closer ""Never Know"" is a quiet, last-call of a song, one that slowly slinks in and curls up by the fire, betting you won't notice until it's too late to turn away. It's all Uta here, clad in raggedy blues, with only the faintest snap of a snare and a handful of sleepy guitar licks to keep her warm. She channels the classic wronged-woman vibe of the old Delta sirens, all honeyed threats and throaty whispers. Halfway through the lull, the beast awakens, and that woman howls it out loud, over a drugged dirge of bass and axe and funeral drums. It's an unexpected turn, and a damn fine way to end an album. Witch Mountain have proved that they've still got plenty of tricks tucked away up their wizards' sleeves and that, if we know what's good for us, we'll keep one eye open, and turn it towards Salem.</p></div>"|16634.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16634-cauldron-of-the-wild/|7.8|Kim Kelly

Untouched by the executive meddling that often results in interminable delays and other clusterfucks when underground rappers transition to major labels, <i>Flockaveli's </i>""Hard in Da Paint"" and ""O Let's Do It"" emphasized the elements that made the album work: Waka's all-hooks-and-ad-libs lyricism, the decimating bombast of Lex Luger's game-changing production, and an OCD-level commitment to unrepentant aggression not seen since the commercial peak of Ruff Ryders and No Limit.</p>
<p>Predictably, there are hands <i>all over</i> Flocka's sophomore album, <i>Triple F Life: Friends, Fans &amp; Family</i>: Goon-rap knuckleheads Kebo Gotti and Uncle Murda are swapped out for bankable stars (Nicki Minaj, B.o.B, Drake), and the beats, while contributed by a range of Luger affiliates (Southside, 808 Mafia and Boi-1da), are airy, stroboscopic, and more likely to make <a href=""http://www.complex.com/music/2012/06/video-funkmaster-flex-disses-nicki-minaj-at-summer-jam"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Funkmaster Flex drop rants than bombs</a>. This will be a problem for anyone who saw <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14771-flockaveli/"" target=""_blank""><i>Flockaveli</i></a> as an antidote for mainstream hip-hop becoming increasingly tailored to Euro clubs in both sound and couture.</p>
<p>Flocka's always struck me as a stylistic descendant of the Tunnel Banger MC, so it's fitting that <i>Triple F</i> makes a similar move to DMX between <i>It's Dark and Hell Is Hot</i> and <i>Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood</i>: he exchanges the debut's antisocial charisma and grim ambience for something more amenable to pop stardom as defined by MTV. It's sonically bolder and brighter but also more personal and caricatured. The record is all crowd-pleasing gestures, and if there were still any question about whether a rapper named Waka Flocka Flame has any artistic self-awareness, it can end here.</p>
<p>I doubt many of us can identify with most of what's being expressed on <i>Triple F</i>, and that's exactly the point. While Flocka's obviously got personality to spare, on record he serves as more of an avatar, a means for projecting one's own id. (He tags himself as ""Mr. Let It Go"" at the end of his verse from ""Round of Applause"", and it's an easy thing to overlook, seeing as how he rhymes it with ""let it go."") But pop music has always contained some element of wish fulfillment, and at its best, <i>Triple F</i> gives credence to the notion that the impulses that cause one to buy out the bar, beat some dude over his head with a bottle of Ciroc, and yell ""SQUAAAD!!!"" at the top of your lungs are contained within the same spectrum. Tracks like ""Let Dem Guns Blam"" and ""Fist Pump"" are essentially rap-metal without the guitars, not meant as storytelling or even acknowledgements of real life situations. </p>
<p><i>Triple F</i> doesn't come off like an endorsement for these actions so much as a validation of them, and that confusion can cause Flocka to be unfairly viewed as a threat to more cerebral hip-hop rather than a complement to it. But even if Flocka will be the first to tell you he's an entertainer first and foremost, it's worth noting how much he's improved as a rapper. His evolution since <i>Flockaveli</i> has been subtle (at least to the extent that anything about him can be subtle) but undeniable, whether on his own <a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Waka-Flocka-Lebron-Flocka-James-3-mixtape.275411.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">awkwardly titled</a> <a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/Waka-Flocka-DuFlocka-Rant-10-Toes-Down-mixtape.236241.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mixtapes</a> or outshining the likes of French Montana and Gucci Mane on their split records. He doesn't go anywhere new lyrically on <i>Triple F</i>, but as an MC, he's gotten much better at doing Flocka things. His rapping is more animated and agile, and he can pull off double-time flows as convincingly as his three-words-per-bar yelp. He's gotten funnier, too. Take a couple of lines from Luger's funereal strip-club banger ""Round of Applause"": ""That girl look like Halle Berry when I'm on them beans"" is worth a chuckle, but when Flocka drops one of his better ad-libs in ""ROLLIN!!!""? Comedy gold. Just like adding a nerdy volunteer of ""YES!"" to ""Flocka, can you be my baby daddy?"" or sarcastically explaining a pervasive if seemingly non sequitur ad-lib by reducing all manner of fraudulent thuggery to <i>""that's so not squad"" </i>on ""U Ain't Bout That Life"".</p>
<p>But make no mistake, <i>Triple F </i>is not <i>Flockaveli 2</i>. It's very much a brazen pop-rap album and it falls victim to most of the same hazards we've come to expect from them. For one thing, it's frontloaded as hell: The first five proper tracks on <i>Triple F </i>are its best, you've already heard them all, and there isn't a ""Grove St. Party"" or ""Live by the Gun"" to balance things out later on. Instead, ""Flex"" and ""Cash"" prove to be every bit the late-album filler their titles indicate, and the latter shows <i>Triple F's </i>2011 labor pains by being probably the most blatant ""Racks"" ripoff committed to tape.</p>
<p>As for the guest spots, this isn't a situation like <i>Teflon Don, </i>Rick Ross' post-cred victory lap, where hip-hop's biggest names all submitted to the ground rules of Planet Boss. On <i>Triple F</i>, it's less about chemistry than what these artists' appearances signify: Drake sounds relieved bragging about ""throwin' every president 'cept for Nixon on your ass"" without having to delve into the attendant psychodrama and ramifications on masculinity, but his guest verse on ""Round of Applause"" is one of his least distinctive as a result. Nicki Minaj acquits herself nicely enough on the mercenary but well-executed pop-rap trifle ""Get Low"", but passes up the opportunity to develop any sort of chemistry with Flocka. The same goes for ""Candy Paint &amp; Gold Teeth"": The presence of Bun B and Ludacris all but assures it will end up like every other ""southern hospitality"" concept track they get asked to do rather than one tailored to Flocka's sensibilities.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, the title of <i>Triple F</i> can seem fairly ironic. Compared to <i>Flockaveli</i>, the presence of Flocka's friends and family is minimal, and most of it appears geared toward fans he doesn't have yet. That changes near the end with more contemplative ""real talk"" tracks like ""Power of My Pen"" and ""Triple F Outro"" acknowledging that while the past two years have been wildly successful for Waka Flocka Flame, you wouldn't wish much of what's happened to Joaquin Malphurs-- witnessing the murder of close friend and collaborator Slim Dunkin and the character assassination of his mother/manager, to name a few-- on anyone.</p>
<p>These tracks are unavoidably jarring, but no more than if they'd been interspersed between ""Rooster in My Rari"" and such. In typical Flocka fashion, he totally overdoes it in a way that's actually charming: Take away the drums and the compulsory ad-libs from ""Triple F Outro"" and its guitars could pass for the National. But even if he's not gonna become 2Pac or Scarface overnight, his stabs at gravitas connect for the same reasons ""Hard in Da Paint"" or ""Round of Applause"" do: It's blunt, transparent, and a total lack of artifice allows its intent and execution to align completely. Such is the case with <i>Triple F</i> on a macro scale: It's tough to imagine Waka repeating <i>Flockaveli</i> and somehow improving on it, but under the cloak of <i>Triple F'</i>s blatant crossover appeals, he slyly exceeds expectations by making a record better than it really needs to be.</p></div>"|16717.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16717-triple-f-life-friends-fans-family/|7.0|Ian Cohen

Matsson's music as <a href=""http://www.thetallestmanonearth.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Tallest Man on Earth</a> gives off an uncanny, hard-to-place air, caught between his native surroundings and the American folk he reveres. But to hear him tackle that familiar melody put some of the strange and hard-to-pin-down appeal of his music into focus. Rough, loud, and unabashedly nasal, Matsson's voice sounded like it was stripping off the song's varnish and hewing each line into something jagged enough to impale you in the heart.</p>
<p>The best songs on <i>The Wild Hunt</i>, like the rollicking strum of ""King of Spain"" and the wistful piano ballad ""Kids on the Run"", had that same directness of melody and threatened just as many splinters. Like so many folkies before him, Matsson assumed the role of the wandering troubadour (""I live until the call, and I plan to be forgotten when I've gone,"" he declared with early-Dylan aplomb on the title track), and his songs, in contrast to folk tradition, didn't so much conjure a distinct sense of time or place as they did a general feeling of restlessness and ever-forward movement. Keeping with the music's sage simplicity, the loneliness of the bare, echoing instrumentation felt decidedly practical: How can you assemble a reliable backing band when you're sleeping under a different tree every night?</p>
<p>It's clear from the title of Matsson's latest, <i>There's No Leaving Now</i>, that things are a little different this time around: He's putting down his roots. Recorded mostly at home over a leisurely five-month stretch, <i>Leaving</i> is more diffuse and relaxed than his earlier albums. It's also his first foray into multi-tracking: He's added woodwinds, drums, and additional fingerpicked guitars to the mix, giving his songs a fuller sound, albeit one that's still characteristically ragged. The intimacy of tracks like ""Revelation Blues"" and ""To Just Grow Away"" forgo the urgency of Dylan and Woody Guthrie channeled on <i>The Wild Hunt </i>for a gentle, pastoral domesticity that sounds closer to Arthur Russell in acoustic mode. Though lyrically still driven by Matsson's wandering spirit and kinship with nature, <i>There's No Leaving Now</i> is an adventure close to home, the sound of someone exploring a nature trail in his own backyard.</p>
<p>Still, the most somber and impassioned songs are the ones that stand out. The title track is a wrenching ballad in the vein of ""Kids on the Run"", while ""Bright Lanterns"" shakes an angry fist at nature's indifference to even the tallest of men (""Damn, you always treat me like a stranger, mountain""). The simple, affecting ""Little Brother"" features the album's strongest vocals, and it derives its power from its lyrical clarity (""Why are you drinking again, little brother/ When your rambling's the hardest part of loving you?""), a quality often absent from Matsson's songwriting. His lyrics can feel like a knotty tangle of ambiguous nature imagery and trail wisdom when you take the time to pick them apart. When <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13612-1904/"" target=""_blank"">he sings</a>, ""But the lesson is vague and the lightning shows a deer with her mind on the moor/ And now something with the sun is just different since they shook the earth in 1904,"" he loses the thread, fittingly, somewhere around ""The lesson is vague.""</p>
<p>That was true of the lyrics on <i>The Wild Hunt</i>, too, but it was harder to be bothered by their lack of specificity when they were lobbed at you with such urgency. <i>There's No Leaving Now</i> dials everything back a few notches: Matsson no longer sings every line like it might be his dying words. On that transfixing ""Graceland"" cover, Matsson's voice had only two settings: dead quiet and pushed way into the red. <i>There's No Leaving Now</i> finds him instead exploring the spectrum in between those two extremes, and while its good to hear his sound evolving, the results are mixed. It's a pretty and intimately rendered collection of folk songs, but those moments of jarringly direct, piercing emotion are few.</p></div>"|16711.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16711-theres-no-leaving-now/|7.1|Lindsay Zoladz

To wit, next month they'll launch a 51-day, 50-state-and-D.C. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46751-melvins-to-attempt-guinness-world-record/"" target=""_blank"">American run</a> with the express aim of earning a spot in Guinness World Records for the fastest nationwide tour. In the past six years, they've released three LPs, splits with Isis, Unsane, and Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, a few live albums, and a box set, just to sample. They've gigged relentlessly, too, touring as a two-drummer quartet that's incorporated both halves of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5149-big-business/"" target=""_blank"">Big Business</a> for some of their most charged sets and records in years. <i>Freak Puke</i>, the band's latest LP, offers another Melvins shift that's obvious insofar as much as it's unpredictable, another (temporary) lineup shift for the stably unstable Buzz Osborne and Dale Crover and, really, another good ol' Melvins stunt. Under the name ""Melvins Lite,"" <i>Freak Puke</i> pulls away the younger half of the band and adds double bassist Trevor Dunn, the far-flung collaborator and Mr. Bungle member who has previously joined Osborne in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1451-fantomas/"" target=""_blank"">Fantômas</a>. They cover Macca, improvise, and turn plenty-weird songs into still-weirder jams, creating a 42-minute funhouse of horror and delight. </p>
<p>Melvins Lite is certainly an interesting attempt to push a consistently restless crew toward new textures. There are moments here that, even within the sprawling Melvins oeuvre, seem nebulous. On the short ""Inner Ear Rupture"", for instance, the trio segues from amp-and-drum cycles to growling, non-linear exploration. For 10-minute closer ""Tommy Goes Berserk"", they take the alternate approach, climbing from the lounge skitter of three creeping psyschos to the shrieking bombast of a power trio of psych rockers. ""Worm Farm Waltz"" offers a prototypical mid-tempo Melvins march, a sharp riff coiled beneath growled verses. But after about 90 seconds, the song gets progressively stranger, flipping from a bowed-bass march to a paranoid sing-along to, at its end, a snarling mess of Elliott Carter-like grate and ruin. </p>
<p>Despite the personnel shift, <i>Freak Puke</i> isn't some anomalous tangent, as it often sounds like exactly what it is: beastly Melvins songs with a surprising fold between Crover's drums and Osborne's guitar. During some of the more vicious, viscous numbers, Dunn's sharp tone and defined upright hooks provide a counterintuitive contrast for the rock numbers. When they cover Wings' ""Let Me Roll It"", for instance, Osborne lets that trademark riff languish above noise and bulbous bass, the itinerant Melvins crunch suggesting the weirdest bar band you've ever heard. And on the title track, Dunn neatly fits tiny phrases between the guitar's turnarounds. ""A Growing Disgust"" is a lumbering beast and the album's best track, mostly because it makes Dunn work within the context of Osborne and Crover's familiar back and forth. He skips between the plodding beat and the sidewinding lead, creating diagonal crosses between the number's opposing components. It's the tune here that truly pushes <i>Freak Puke</i> from novelty territory, a morass with which Crover and Osborne certainly aren't strangers.</p>
<p class=""p1"">All told, <i>Freak Puke</i> functions better as part of the Melvins' loud, strange strip than a particular destination. A potential one-off by what Osborne has called ""the fifth side of the four-sided Melvins triangle,"" <i>Freak Puke</i> represents a band that's always in motion doing what it's always done: trying a crazy idea, releasing and reveling in the results and, before long, likely moving along to the next instantaneous notion. That's the spirit that's always made the Melvins great, just as it does on <i>Freak Puke</i>, if only in bits and pieces.</p></div>"|16685.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16685-freak-puke/|6.7|Grayson Currin

As the renaissance of the classically trained cellist/Buddha-pop enthusiast/leftfield disco auteur/cowboy-shirted indie-folk trailblazer Arthur Russell has swelled to include <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12375-love-is-overtaking-me/"" target=""_blank"">many</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6910-first-thought-best-thought/"" target=""_blank"">lovingly</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6908-calling-out-of-context/"" target=""_blank"">rendered</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6909-world-of-echo/"" target=""_blank"">reissues</a>, a big biography, and impressionistic documentary, so too does Zummo's nimble trombone work subliminally reach more ears. That's him delivering the booming Skatalite-like horn line on Russell's Paradise Garage staple ""Go Bang #5"", adding cumulous soundclouds to the heavenly ""In the Light of the Miracle"", and foghorning amid the cello fuzz of ""The Platform on the Ocean"".</p>
<p>From modern classical to disco classicism, Zummo shadowed the man's singular cello lines with his own peerless trombone work, and no matter Russell's genre or interval leaps, he remained the closest of collaborators. So it makes sense that Russell would repay the favor on Peter Zummo's first album of original compositions, 1985's <i>Zummo With an X</i>, with one side devoted to a seven-sectioned piece entitled ""Instruments"" from 1980 and another composition from 1985 entitled ""Song IV"" taking up the other. Out of print on vinyl since its release (though the CD reissue from 2006 tacks on ""Lateral Pass"", another 25 minutes of lovely music), JD Twitch of the record obsessive DJ duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6106-how-to-kill-the-dj-part-two"" target=""_blank"">Optimo</a> has taken it upon himself to reissue the album on vinyl. No doubt, it's a piece of music that's close to his heart.</p>
<p>And let's be real here, it's certainly not because of ""Instruments"". Beyond the Glass-Reich Titans of Minimalism Industry that overshadowed most of the late-1970s/early-1980s modern classical scene of New York City, previously ignored works continue to surface to varying grades of astonishment and cosmic justice, be it the efforts of composers like Jon Gibson, Yoshi Wada, Charlemagne Palestine, Dickie Landry, or Peter Gordon's Love of Life Orchestra. ""Instruments was my answer to a militaristic sort of minimalism that had become popular at the time,"" writes Zummo in the original liner notes. ""I had a much freer-flowing notion.""</p>
<p>Yet in listening, it's difficult to hear such openness. Rik Albani's trumpet duets with Zummo's trombone in repetitious two-note phrases while Bill Ruyle's marimba sometimes percolates in the back and Russell's cello is all but impossible to discern. The composition is dryly segmented by half-steps, sixths, sevenths, whole steps, and the like. They move in and out of phase, yet rather than explore the rich tonalities that can occur from such phasing and overtones, it simply never manifests. Perhaps not enjoying the nuances of such composition exludes my ears from the piece, but throughout it feels more like the rote practice of scales than some exploration of freedom. </p>
<p>Then again, on the original CD issue of <i>Zummo With an X</i>, ""Song IV"" is positioned first, and rarely has there been an instance in the past five years where I have ever needed to hear something else besides ""Song IV""'s quiet majesty. In a temporal world where Don Draper's statement that the human condition is one where ""happiness is a moment before you need more happiness,"" Zummo's ""Song IV"" is pure manna, the sound of sublimity that erases the need for more sound. Tangentially, it's a 20-minute trio recording from 1985, yet such numbers feel feeble against its sound. There is no gauge of duration or where it slots in the discographies of its participants. There's a softness, a fragility to ""Song IV"", much like magnetic filaments or crystal structures, things that would dissolve if touched or dissected. It would be the sound of a Rothko painting, were such canvases portals denoting nirvana rather than the void.</p>
<p>Its closest relation would be to Indian classical music, what with Bill Ruyle on tabla and Russell's cello tuned ""like one of the low 'sympathetic' strings on a sitar,"" according to Zummo's liner notes on the CD reissue. Russell's bow taps out beats that dovetail with the tabla's patter in such a manner that sends shivers down the nervous system. But it's as Russell's cello scrapes (and their attendant bit of electronic processing) intermingles with Zummo's muted trombone, close-mic'd so that every breath and growl can be felt that makes my arm hairs stand on end.</p>
<p>""Song IV"" feels without beginning or end, as if it's this state entered into rather than something structured and composed, and in its universe, so many tiny, amazing epiphanies happen. There's the way that Russell's wordless mumbles conjoin with what Zummo calls ""lip multiphonics,"" or how a certain cello line will suddenly scale upward, or when Zummo sings through his horn an octave above Russell's own voice.

The sort of self-consciously smart guitar music, which started leaking from college towns and working-class cities in the wake of punk, was positioned directly against the stuff coming from the power centers of New York, L.A., or London, championed as the product of local scenes. Whiffs of classic rock largesse commingled amidst minor British-invasion nods, all presented in an unapologetically geeky manner, appealing to those for whom record stores were the primary sites to accumulate cultural capital.</p>
<p><i>Traps</i> is Jaill's third album and their second on Sub Pop. It mingles the barely contained frustrations of OG wimp-rockers (and fellow Milwaukeeans) <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4534-violent-femmes/"" target=""_blank"">Violent Femmes</a> with a hearty Midwestern fondness for riffs and boss solos, while replacing that trio's anti-folk underpinings with a bit of swagger from power-pop godheads <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1027-the-dbs/"" target=""_blank"">the dB's</a>. The result is idiosyncratic pop-rock appealing to geeky outsiders and scene lifers that's perennially in short supply, largely by design: Too much of this stuff would eliminate its need to exist in the first place.</p>
<p>In other words, if everyone's hip, then no one's hip. If you've heard of Jaill before reading this review, it's likely because of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14171-everyones-hip/"">their infectious, strutting 2010 single</a> that picked apart the paradox of social striving. Two years later, that perspective has changed a bit, perhaps soured with age. To wit: ""Everyone's a Bitch"", <i>Traps</i>' anti-anthem outfitted with janky Cheap Trick riffs, which Vinnie Kircher elbows past to announce: ""Everyone's a bitch tonight. I must admit that I've been feeling like I want to die."" <i>Traps</i> is filled with acidic observations of this stripe, driven home by Kircher's pinched vocal. At various points on the album, his delivery resembles not only the barely restrained teen libido of the Femmes' Gordon Gano, but a classic rock bard of a different order: Dan Bejar, particularly circa <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14141-city-of-daughters-thief-streethawk-a-seduction/"" target=""_blank""><i>Streethawk: A Seduction</i></a>. There's little theatrical ambiguity here, though. The focus is more on the simple struggle of going out Thursday night because it's better than staying home, then sitting in the corner and waiting for someone to cross the imaginary lines you've drawn. Setting traps.</p>
<p>Low expectations are self-fulfilling prophecies, after all, and to Jaill's credit, they know that with rock'n'roll you can air them out. The best and prettiest songs on this album, ""Horrible Things (Make Pretty Songs)"" and ""While You Reload"", by all appearances draw productive lessons from the well-plowed ground of the breakup song. There's always a bright side, no matter how dim, and Kircher opens the latter song by admitting that he ""gave myself a good grade on barely losing my shit."" There's plenty of regret embedded throughout <i>Traps</i>, but not much wallowing. Kircher sings of wasting a lot of things, but time, it's clear, doesn't have to be one of them.</p></div>"|16724.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16724-traps/|6.8|Eric Harvey

""I'm like Stevie Wonder/ but I can see things,"" Alexis Taylor sang on ""Keep Fallin'"", from the band's 2004 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4028-coming-on-strong/"" target=""_blank""><i>Coming on Strong</i></a>. In the same breath he compared himself and compatriot Joe Goddard to Gene and Dean Ween: ""We're like brothers who make records who can't play things."" There was a boast about blasting Yo La Tengo from expensive cars, a heartbroken lament centered around prepackaged macaroni and cheese, and a cheeky proclamation about remembering Prince play with Vanity 6 when the narrator was still in diapers. And, I mean, that album title: If naming a fairly minimalistic, handmade electro-soul album <i>Coming on Strong</i> isn't having a laugh, then I don't know what is.</p>
<p>Over the years, Hot Chip retained their sense of humor, largely in the visual sense (funhouse torture devices, boy bands getting attacked by laser beams), but something not-so-funny also started to take place: As they perfected a savvy alchemy of dance and modern pop, their music became more serious. Amidst the big, beating heaters, dancefloor deconstructions, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46346-animal-collective-and-hot-chip-music-featured-on-the-simpsons/"" target=""_blank"">""Simpsons""-soundtracking</a> anthems, there emerged sincere ruminations on love, protection, and the pleasure that one derives from simply experiencing life, all of which were fully realized on 2010's excellent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13908-one-life-stand/"" target=""_blank""><i>One Life Stand</i></a>. The band's most concise and uniformly gorgeous album to date, <i>One Life Stand</i> also represented Hot Chip's most clear-eyed material yet, suggesting that the group was, somewhat soberly, growing up.</p>
<p>Luckily, growing up in Hot Chip's world is a fucking blast. <i>In Our Heads</i>, the group's fifth full-length, is their most playful and colorful record yet, an album-length manifestation of that ""sounds of the studio"" game that cut straight through the middle of ""Shake a Fist"". Fittingly, the record that <i>In Our Heads</i> bears most resemblance to in Hot Chip's catalog is the one that bore that single, 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11129-made-in-the-dark/"" target=""_blank""><i>Made in the Dark</i></a>. That album's audacious genre-flaunting was softly tsk-tsk'd at the time of release for being too uneven and grab-baggy, but its bold charms have lent it a fond longevity. <i>In Our Heads</i> is similarly shaggy-- it kicks off with a tuba-heavy anthem and sails off into the sunset in delicious, wispy yacht-rock glory, with nine detailed detours in between-- but the upward progression in quality from <i>One Life Stand</i> is apparent. The songwriting is as strong and intricate than on 2006's classic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4029-the-warning/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Warning</i></a>, even if it takes a few listens for the finer points to sink in.</p>
<p>A good word to describe <i>One Life Stand</i>'s overall vibe was ""devotional,"" where the practice of worship was solemn and the higher power being worshiped was love, whether for a partner or your fellow man. In its own way,<i> In Our Heads</i> is a religious album, too, a fact that could be gleaned before hearing a single note, courtesy of the colorful cover art and inside-package designs that strongly resemble stained glass. On this collection, worship is celebratory, a point driven home by the LP's mission statement tucked within the sped-up house of ""How Do You Do?"": ""A church is not for praying/ It's for celebrating the light that bleeds through the pain."" Clubgoing agnostics might stay in forever as an act of protest, but the act of believing in something-- whether everlasting love, family, finality, or the essence of self-- is presented throughout as euphoria, the absolute definition of getting high off your own supply.</p>
<p>More than anything else, Hot Chip believe in music itself. On the outset, that statement comes across as a tad obvious, considering the band's career-long demonstration of impeccably executed taste has lent them the somewhat double-edged tag of ""your favorite music nerd's favorite band."" However, <i>In Our Heads</i>' benevolent generosity stretches beyond well-placed reference points, becoming an act of celebration that relates to making music. Joe Goddard <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45727-video-hot-chip-flutes/"" target=""_blank"">told us</a> back in March that much of the album's inspiration came from the ""ecstatic moments"" found on maxi-12"" extended mixes from the 1980s. Although the slow jams on display (especially the affecting closer ""Always Been Your Love"", featuring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1831-gang-gang-dance/"" target=""_blank"">Gang Gang Dance</a>'s Lizzi Bougatsos on backing vocals) find the band further spinning their love of R&amp;B and soft-rock staples into the type of sonic gold that would be impressive on its own, it's the psychedelic blowout of <i>In Our Heads</i>' back half, which nicely compliments the front end's squelchy pop pleasures, that embraces that extended-mix ideal.</p>
<p>There's the dark, swirling techno of ""Flutes"", the up-with-movement electro-gospel of ""Ends of the Earth"", and, most notably, ""Let Me Be Him"". The song's a seven-minute-plus odyssey that lovingly glides through miles of endless warmth, its final destination a tropical utopia slathered in snatches of Balearic guitar that drip with sticky nectar. ""Let Me Be Him"" is one of the finest songs Hot Chip have put to tape, and from Goddard's lyrical genuflection to a higher power to an Alexis-sung line that doubles as a plea for fertile creativity (""Work hard, play hard at work/ Lend me your ideas/ But not too fully formed""), it beats with a bejeweled heart.</p>
<p>As a culture, dance music is sometimes perceived to be exclusionary, but its most basic pleasures lie in the escapism that the raw materials provide. Whether you're getting pummeled by a club's soundsystem or enjoying the comforts that a decent pair of headphones provide, the right tune can turn you starry-eyed, wiping your mind totally blank and making you happy to be alive just so you could be present to experience that very moment. Hot Chip understand that feeling, and through the broad populist strokes that frequently make up their work, they want everyone to experience it. That's why they're an important band, but <i>In Our Heads</i> isn't the work of a band that's attempting to assert its relevance. It's a meditation on positivity, a hedonistic joyride that isn't afraid to get deep, and a reminder that any band-- any album, any song-- can be your life, even for just a moment. Hot Chip do this for themselves, but also, for us.</p></div>"|16706.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16706-in-our-heads/|8.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

""<i>Synthetica</i> is about staying home and wanting to crawl out of your skin from the lack of external stimulation,"" <a href=""http://ilovemetric.com/news/post.php?s=2012-04-01-a-note-from-emily"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">she wrote</a>. ""It's about what is real versus what is artificial."" This binary is common in contemporary art, to the point that it can seem a little trite, but Haines is too clever to settle into a simplistic ""technology is bad"" argument. Instead, she spends much of <i>Synthetica</i> pondering the way the human mind is transformed by artificial versions of natural experiences and wondering how to feel fully alive and present in a time of constant distraction.</p>
<p>Haines shares some of her themes with fellow Canadian artist <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29568-grimes/"" target=""_blank"">Grimes</a>, but the difference in their style and approach highlights a generation gap between the women. Grimes' <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16211-grimes-visions/"" target=""_blank""><i>Visions</i></a> is typically described as ""post-internet,"" a term that doesn't quite address Claire Boucher's lyrics as much as her aesthetic, which comes across as the product of a mind that has been immersed in the web since childhood. Her multi-tracked vocals cross and tangle like thoughts that are going in different directions and only take shape in aggregate, with strong emotions scattering rather than spiking at moments of catharsis. <i>Synthetica</i>, on the other hand, comes from the perspective of a singer who can vividly recall her life before laptops and smart phones, and has some frame of reference for how these things have changed the substance of her mind. The music forces itself into rigid shapes; the lyrics are boldly declarative. While Grimes evokes a fragmented, freeform mental state, Haines and her bandmates are constantly seeking definition. Their record is rebellious, vigilant, and a bit uptight.</p>
<p>Metric's music has always been about as precise as their name would imply. Guitarist and producer Jimmy Shaw favors guitar and keyboard hooks that snap into tight, rhythmic grids and tones that add vibrant color while staying within the proverbial lines. The approach has yielded mixed results-- their best material ends up seeming glossy and stylish, while the so-so tunes come out sounding overworked or bland. This is still the case on<i> Synthetica</i>, though the material is more consistently strong this time around. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13537-youth-without-youth/"" target=""_blank"">""Youth Without Youth""</a> makes the most of their mechanical tightness by emulating the schaffel stomp of Goldfrapp and Gary Glitter, while ""The Void"" and the excellent ballad ""Clone"" successfully contrast cold tones and rhythmic stiffness with particularly vulnerable vocal performances by Haines. ""Breathing Underwater"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13654-speed-the-collapse/"" target=""_blank"">""Speed the Collapse""</a> may border on generic, but the group steps out of its comfort zone on the opener ""Artificial Nocturne"", which approaches the motorik bliss of Stereolab songs like ""Jenny Ondioline"" but frustratingly cuts out before they can fully crest out on the groove.</p>
<p>Haines is a vocalist with limited range, but she's good at conveying character and nuance in her phrasing even when working within her default position of earnest defiance. She switches up her style a bit here and there on <i>Synthetica</i>, putting on a faux-girlish tone on ""Lost Kitten"", and bringing out a seldom utilized sweetness to balance out the sourness of duet partner Lou Reed on ""The Wanderlust"". (Yes, somehow Lou Reed is on this record.) Her position is always clear on a lyrical level, but her voice lends a touch of depth and ambiguity to the music, which opens up her ""artificial vs. natural"" thesis to debate. <i>Synthetica</i> is something of a polemic, but Haines' moments of ambivalence are what make the record compelling. At their best, Metric resist making statements about how technology is changing our minds and culture, and simply ask thoughtful questions about it with the awareness that there are no easy answers.</p></div>"|16712.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16712-synthetica/|7.0|Matthew Perpetua

Now we have <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46326-grimes-launches-jewelry-line-with-pussy-rings/"">Grimes' pussy rings</a>, a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/40061-check-it-out-wavves-branded-weed-grinders/"">Wavves' weed grinder</a>, and a <a href=""http://yfrog.com/nyik8zyj"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dent May's SPF lip balm</a>. Dent May's choice of totem feels particularly apt when listening to his latest record. If you're young and carefree then <i>Do Things</i> is the kind of record you want constantly at your side as a crowd-pleasing soundtrack to the summer. Its 10 songs make for an instantly welcoming, easy spin, with each hook borrowing deeply into you head thanks more to persistence than any particular potency.</p>
<p>The chorus of ""Fun"" feels like the record's quick-beating heart: ""I don't know what's in store for me, but I think it's gonna be fun."" That youthful sentiment is a long way from the angst of getting older, or worrying about the economy; instead Dent May just wants to kick back with major chords and party. He's even ditched his magnificent ukelele. In its place are spritely synths, airy acoustic guitars, and hints of psychedelia.</p>
<p>May's croon is still his best weapon and his well-laced harmonies help elevate much of the material here. At times he sounds uncannily like Brian Wilson, and the music of the Beach Boys looms large over the record. On ""Tell Her"", May seems to be sight-reading an only partially scrambled Wilson chord sequence. Alongside swooning, lilting harmonies, May's light smattering of electronics and synthesizers do just enough work to update the scene. That combination of sounds makes for a formula that May mines carefully on each track: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13369-best-friend/"" target=""_blank"">""Best Friend""</a> and ""Don't Wait Too Long"" both boast a little funk, but for much of <i>Do Things</i> May finds his range and sticks with it.</p>
<p>The one overcast moment comes via the title track. As if it weren't obvious enough, the sound of rain and thunder ushers the song in as May croons, ""There was a time when I never thought that I'd feel good again."" His usually positive outlook is darkened here for just a moment, but still never feels heavy; more Hollywood rainclouds than anything particularly malign. Despite being slightly unconvincing, the song offers a welcome contrast to the saccharine taste of the rest of the LP.</p>
<p>For all the good-natured vibes this record gives off, it's hard to ignore that <i>Do Things</i> is also a limited collection. It's easy to suspect Dent May's ambitions are as simple as to craft a record that finds itself endlessly stuffed into car stereos this summer. (There are too many lines like ""When the mood's right, do what feels right"" to ignore those basic teenage instincts.) But if escapism is what you want, <i>Do Things</i> won't be hard to find: it'll be the CD in a cracked case next to an SPF lip balm, and that's probably what Dent May wants.</p></div>"|16713.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16713-do-things/|6.6|Hari Ashurst

After all, he's the man who combined <i>Pet Sounds</i> and the music of J Dilla to entirely non-terrible effect. Four-and-a-half years after his first material appeared, though, he still hasn't put out a proper debut album, instead darting around releasing unpredictable EPs and the odd single on different carefully curated labels. The <i>Canterbury Mix</i>, which preceded the 2010 EP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15896-bullion-you-drive-me-to-plastic/"" target=""_blank""><i>You Drive Me to Plastic</i></a>, contained psych-folk strains from the likes of Caravan, Gong, and Robert Wyatt, which didn't particularly manifest itself on the release it heralded. On the <i>Love Me Oh Please Love Me</i> EP, however, Jenkins includes a stringed, aridly dubby cover of Wyatt's ""The Age of Self"", which curiously lends the collection a modern sentiment: ""There's people doing frightfully well, there's others on the shelf/ But never mind the second kind, this is the age of self."" It's basically as detached a sneer at the 1% as it's possible to muster.</p>
<p>That's really the only point at which Jenkins' voice rises above the parapet, even on a frequently vocal-led EP. You could allude to a sense of hopelessness in the repetitive refrains of ""It's All in Sound"", a reserved drone with a Caribou-like itch that spirals into a spectacular saxophone solo. However, Jenkins' templated vocals are one of the EP's weaker links. Here, the pattern is ""Thinking up and thinking down/ Whichever way around, it's all in sound/ Walk back and sideways too/ Whichever way you like."" The Badalamenti-heavy pads and chipping woodblocks of ""Collision"" couch awkward verses (""I feel het up/ There is no let up"") that slowly accelerate towards a more graceful rhyme: ""My vision/ And your vision/ It's a collision."" ""Keep a Document"" urges capturing moments in order to ""Watch mum smile again/ She's a child again/ Times are wild again."" These blocky verses unnecessarily affect a false and mildly contrived style in what's largely a very fluid EP.</p>
<p>The beginning of the penultimate song, ""Family"", feels like an Atlas Sound track getting suffocated not by digital crackle, the way that Bradford Cox's material under that moniker often goes, but by taut, ephemeral 1980s synth pop. It's an odd combination that somehow works, the two strains looming over each other throughout until they combine into a luscious harp bounce woven through by bursts of harmonica. ""Save Your Lubb"" starts off sounding like the rhythm section from Kelis' ""Millionaire"", and winds from being a light beach-side frolic to a kind of space-age prairie trek, all heavy crevices, strange lunar washes, and widescreen haunt. Unsurprisingly, Jenkins has a knack of leading the listener on a peculiar trajectory, although it often turns out to be a fun wild goose chase. As a whole, <i>Love Me Oh Please Love Me</i> slows from an agitated funk to a dry, Oriental-inflected slump over the course of its six songs, and aside from the odd foreboding draught of reverb, it lacks the freakiness of <i>You Drive Me to Plastic</i>. In that sense, <i>Love Me</i> feels no closer to elucidating what might go on when Bullion finally releases an LP, but it tantalizingly adds to the pot.</p></div>"|16673.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16673-love-me-oh-please-love-me/|6.8|Laura Snapes

PdP records sound as if all of their percussion instruments are made of extraterrestrial glass and recorded in the vast hull of some abandoned starship. It is painstaking stuff, but the music unfolds as if it's alive rather than carefully cut-and-pasted, as if Weber were less programming beats than growing little self-directing universes in bottles. Even the occasional snatches of natural or industrial noise, which should remind you of the messy outside world, can't break the tracks' hermetic, otherworldly spell.</p>
<p>Pantha du Prince tracks are also very <i>uniform</i>, but that's no bad thing. When one works up a sonic signature that seems to allow for infinite (and inviting) small variations, you're wise not to abandon it too quickly. Which makes the new pseudonym, the restless dance producer's friend, all the more important, especially if that fresh moniker comes attached to a collaboration that prods the artist out of comfortable habits.</p>
<p>There are moments on <i>Ursprung</i>, Weber's casual, and sometimes casually brilliant, new project with Stephan Abry, one half of the krautrock-as-indie-pop act Workshop with the artist Kai Althoff, that recall Pantha du Prince, most especially the whirlpools of percussive noise that bubble up every so often. But while <i>Ursprung</i> retains Weber's organic minimalism-- this is an album of tiny gestures that seem to evolve of their own accord as much as be directed-- it mostly abandons his bright and glacial digital palette. The alternating warm and wistful, uneasy and muted tone of Workshop's guitar-band set-up is more in evidence, even if Ursprung strays far from ""songcraft,"" however broadly you may define a song. As for even the most tenuous connection to dance music, forget it. The comforting tick-tock beats that drive much of <i>Ursprung</i> are there strictly for some semblance of structure, motorik rhythms dragged down to tempos DJ Screw might appreciate, even less interested in funk or forward momentum than Pantha du Prince's eddies of tinkle and clink.</p>
<p>Long stretches of <i>Ursprung</i> remind me of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4237-kosmischer-pitch/"" target=""_blank"">Jan Jelinek's underrated <i>Kosmischer Pitch</i></a>, another record where an avant-dance producer, known for building insular digital worlds out of unnatural sounds, gets his hands dirty merging live instruments with editing software, affirming that the hairy hippie history of Germanic art-rock somehow led to highbrow modern electronic music. Wanting to both (gently) engage you and to just trance out, <i>Ursprung</i> is ambient where the gnarled textures and spooked vibe keep you from being able to relax entirely, which is almost always the best kind of ambient. As is S.O.P., Weber and Abry cite Brian Eno as an inspiration point, but if so it's the haunted woodlands and abandoned beaches Eno conjured with <i>On Land</i>, rather than the soothingly inert repetitions of <i>Music for Airports</i>.</p>
<p>There's also a lot of guitar that actually resembles what 99% of humanity wants from a guitar, rather than a guitar used as a machine for generating sound washes, but don't go expecting a rock record. Sometimes on <i>Ursprung</i> we get Fahey-signs-to-Factory guitars, and sometimes we get Michael Rother-in-an-autumnal-mood guitars. So we're talking plangent-but-hypnotic grooves rather than the immediacy of riffs, and miniature jams that split the difference between pastoral meandering and freeform noodling. Affecting, but in a way that stirs what Robert Christgau once derisively called the ""vaguer emotions."" Ursprung's guitar sounds like a guy plucking strings, but they're still using it to conjure ambient's abstract moods. Maybe think Bon Iver's spacier stretches of fingerpicking, if Justin Vernon abandoned every last earthy hint of the blues.</p>
<p>The guitar work may seesaw between pleasant mindlessness and the mindfulness of a craftsman, but the album's production sounds like the work of two fully engaged brains. No idea how the workload was split, but the environment-creating detail and attention to goosebump-raising fluctuations in timbre and grain certainly feels like Weber. This mix of gauze and grit, ear-grabbing and wombing, is one of <i>Ursprung</i>'s biggest draws, especially in a genre that too often tends toward formless gloop. Even when the melodic ideas feel undercooked, or almost drowned in pools of electronic haze, the guitars retain a fingers-on-frets tactility that's wonderful. And the electronic elements likewise have a crispness and snap that plays almost psychedelically again the tracks' gauzy aether.</p>
<p>Ambient's always had an uneasy relationship with traditional ideas of musical effort. (Get <i>too</i> interesting, and suddenly you're in a different zone entirely.) But the last few years have seen a lot of lazy reverb abuse, mushy beats, and mood muzak trying to pass itself off as exploratory music-making, from both the indie rock and electronic worlds. Weber and Abry are two brave souls in attempting reintroduce <i>ideas</i>, sometimes a positively bounteous three or four ideas per track, into a genre where eight minutes of a muddy synth loop gets you hailed as a genius. That they don't treat ambient as empty-headed fluff for relaxation is laudable, but it also doesn't make <i>Ursprung</i> any less of a record for a self-selecting coterie of sound-art aficionados. If you still require things like hooks, humor, and human emoting in your music, all that hard work may make you wonder where Ursprung could go if they applied this simultaneously bracing and blissed-out blend, the sun-warped woozy atmosphere and sharp detail, to an actual band writing actual songs. Maybe they can helm the next Real Estate album?</p></div>"|16780.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16780-ursprung/|6.0|Jess Harvell

On the strength of that one track, the hot-shot Harlem-based MC with a slyly aggressive flow became not just a rising star but a boundary-busting symbol of hip-hop's ever-changing mores. While some listeners gasped at the supposed audacity of Rihanna's suggestive chant, ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5K7U8YMb3c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cake cake cake</a>,"" Banks, grinning, was like, ""cunt, cunt, cunt."" Around the time Ye and Jay were extolling jet-setter excess on <i>Watch the Throne</i>, Banks drummed up the sort of publicity you can't buy thanks to a charismatic, low-concept video shot on a DSLR. And as for the guy still stuck on the ""no homo"" refrain, the <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/02/fashion/azealia-banks-a-young-rapper-taking-cues-from-the-street.html?_r=3&amp;ref=fashion"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">openly bisexual</a> Banks waited until he wasn't looking and then slipped out the door with his girl <i>and</i> his best friend. By the measure of pretty much any metaphor you can throw at her right now, Azealia Banks is the girl with the most cake.</p>
<p>Banks' first official release, a four-song EP titled <i>1991</i>, still finds her standing at a lot of interesting junctions, if not committing to a solid path. She's currently prepping a mixtape (<i>Fantasea</i>, which is slated for July) and a Paul Epworth-produced Interscope debut, <i>Broke With Expensive Taste</i>. But despite her visibility, the half-statement of <i>1991</i> reminds us that Banks is still an artist in her development stage. </p>
<p>From its opening ""excuse-moi""s and ""ooh-la-las,"" <i>1991</i>'s vibe is an almost comically caricatured version of extravagance and luxury. The title track's beat is runway-ready and Banks, reclined but in control, unfurls her lines like somebody chiseled is feeding her grapes. Like ""212"", it's an introductory statement, but this time Banks is in no hurry; a few minutes roll by before she gets to the breathy but bombastic hook, ""NY rose me, most high chose me/ Let me know what I can-can-can-can do for you.""</p>
<p>Like much of the music Banks has released so far, <i>1991</i> owes a stylistic debt to New York's vogue ball culture. The title refers to the year Banks was born, but it's also a year after the release of the cult documentary <i>Paris Is Burning</i>, which chronicled the drag ball scene, and a year after Madonna introduced voguing to middle America. She may be riding the crest of a revival of ball imagery right now, but this aesthetic is much more than just a trendy put-on. Ball culture is where she picked up that controversial vocabulary (""I feel like 'cunt' means so feminine... in the vein of, like, voguing,"" she said in a 2011 interview) and it's also responsible for the particular air of luxury that pervades <i>1991</i>. Vogue culture values DIY fabulosity and ""1991"" and ""Van Vogue"" stay true to that spirit: They don't sound like songs about pursuing wealth so much as they profess of a kind of luxury of the self. Which means she's not rapping about accumulating cars and private jets; the finer things in life, Banks always seems to be saying, are the ones that make you look good.</p>
<p>Some of Banks' best lines are elegantly self-aggrandizing and enemy-deflating (""You gonna be a bitch, nigga, I'ma be that bitch""), but she's just as capable of executing those moves in more straightforward terms (""I'ma ruin you, cunt""). Even when she's barking her most aggressive lines, Banks' signature is her sly irony, and she lacquers it on deliciously thick here on the previously released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12900-liquorice/"" target=""_blank"">""Liquorice""</a> (""Can my hot fudge bitches get with your vanilla friends/ Hey, I'm the liquorice bitch, you know I'm looking for these niggas if these niggas is rich"").</p>
<p>Like any new artist greeted with the sort of fanfare, the expectations people have of Banks seem perilously high. As an MC with commercial potential who's repping for hip-hop's two majorly underrepresented groups (women and the queer community), it's easy to saddle Banks with savior-sized hopes. But the long-delayed <i>1991</i> is solid and unsurprisingly promising. ""What you gon' do when I appear? When I premiere?"" she roars memorably at the climax of ""212"", and <i>1991</i> doesn't so much answer that question as add a couple of more dots to the ellipses. But as another example of Banks' versatile skills, it also gives ample reason to stick around for the answer.</p></div>"|16775.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16775-1991-ep/|7.7|Lindsay Zoladz

More than two decades ago, Vikernes became a pillar of emergent black metal, both for the wildly emotive and ruthless qualities of his best records and for his status as the anti-Christian wildchild who burned churches and murdered his bud/label owner/rival, Mayhem guitarist Euronymous. While locked away for some combination of those crimes, he continued to push the reach of black metal, both stylistically and socially: Though they're little more than ham-fisted neo-classical baubles, the pair of electronic albums Vikernes recorded while in prison certainly helped presage the form's recent sprawl. What's more, while behind bars, Vikernes played a star role-- the troubled philosopher-poet, standing up for his country and his ego-- in <i><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_of_Chaos_(book)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lords of Chaos</a></i>, the 1998 non-fiction black metal journal that did so well it warranted a second edition. More than a decade later, the documentary <a href=""http://www.blackmetalmovie.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Until the Light Takes Us</i></a> caught him talking radicalism (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbo0jFUzX6k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">and cereal</a>) in his jail-time get-up.</p>
<p>So, yes, without Vikernes, the black metal story doesn't happen, or at least it doesn't get book-deal interesting or, consequently, quite so popular to another generation of pissed-off kids who've since turned the sound inside out. But if Vikernes had never made another Burzum album after his release from prison in 2009, the world probably wouldn't have demanded one. He did, though, and setting aside the controversy about the artist, his album titles, or the incredibly stupid name of his label (""Byelobog,"" or ""Whitegod,"" or ""Fucking obvious move, Varg""), those records-- 2010's strange <i>Belus</i> and last year's ferocious <i>The </i><i>Fallen</i>-- were actually quite good. They didn't necessarily change the perceptions of Burzum or expand the conceptions of the music Vikernes made, but they did serve as a reminder that Burzum mattered outside the context of his vileness. </p>
<p>In the past seven months, however, he's done his best to obviate that idea: Last November, he released <a href=""http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Burzum/From_the_Depths_of_Darkness/319197"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>From the Depths of Darkness</i></a>, an 11-track collection that combined three short instrumentals pieces with eight re-recordings of Burzum classics from his first two full-lengths. Despite the resurrection suggested by the title, <i>Darkness</i> was as pointless as it was bad, not so much recalling past successes as detracting from them. Still, the familiarity with those songs made them more bearable than those on the new <i>Umskiptar</i>, an album that's only listenable to the extent that it's laughable. </p>
<p>Vikernes based <i>Umskiptar</i> on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%B6lusp%C3%A1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Völuspá""</a>, a 66-stanza poem that serves as the Norse creation-destruction-rebuilding myth and is essential to Vikernes' ignominious nationalist ideology. He sings the story in his native tongue, his plain baritone dispensing the tale with minimal inflection, as though he were a droll history teacher or minister relaying a foundational message yet again. (If you're interested in the poem's translation, <a href=""http://www.burzum.org/eng/discography/official/2012_umskiptar.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the website</a> of the keenly capitalist Vikernes suggests picking up the special edition of his 2011 book, <a href=""http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/sorcery_and_religion_in_ancient_scandinavia.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Sorcery and Religion in Ancient Scandinavia</i></a>; or you could simply Google <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?sugexp=chrome,mod=19&amp;ix=h9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%E2%80%9CV%C3%B6lusp%C3%A1+English+Translation%2C%E2%80%9D#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=v%C3%B6lusp%C3%A1%20in%20english&amp;oq=V%C3%B6lusp%C3%A1%20&amp;aq=1&amp;aqi=g2&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=serp.11.1.0l2.5007.6033.2.7825.7.7.0.0.0.1.168.664.5j2.7.0...0.0.XHFZFunnEiE&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=60909d0e42a1fcbc&amp;ix=h9&amp;biw=1436&amp;bih=739&amp;pf=p&amp;pdl=300"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Völuspá in English""</a> and save your money.) In an early press release for <i>Umskiptar</i>, Vikernes explained that the album keys on ""a strong focus on atmosphere."" Though Vikernes has never been one for songcraft so much as feeling, <i>Umskiptar</i> feels particularly void of structure or direction. It's as if that attention to environment and ancient text prompted Vikernes to write and record <i>Umskiptar</i> as though no one else would actually listen to it. Maybe it's best to think of it as a personal-religious trance, then, and to just keep out. </p>
<p>There are occasionally interesting textures, like the submerged piano that opens ""Alfadanz"" or the way the winding guitars in the back half of ""Hit Helga Tré"" give Vikernes' exposed voice some much-needed authoritative lift. But the songs here barely deserve that title. ""Níðhöggr"", for instance, finds Vikernes whispering over field recordings, a bass drum, and a distant, wobbly tone that splits the difference between a trumpet feeding back and a Steven R. Smith guitar meander; its aim seems eerie, but it's mostly amusing, another moment of forced seriousness from a fellow who would do well to find another strategy. ""Níðhöggr"" serves as the start of the big, closing build that culminates with ""Gullaldr"", a 10-minute latticework of tension so rote that it makes every Slint-loving post-rock band of post-grads sound interesting by comparison. On ""Heiðr"", Vikernes buries his incantations between sheets of black-metal guitar screech, occasionally peeling the noise away to emphasize the drama. Once again, it just sounds silly, making it a fitting preamble for ""Valgaldr"", an eight-minute bog in which he wraps ghoulish harmonies around distorted riffs. It's like Iron Maiden on Thorazine, except worse than that might seem.</p>
<p>Even during the decade Vikernes spent in jail without producing new material, he's represented an interesting conversational point among music fans: How do you treat the legacy and possibly fresh output of someone who's done so much to build a sound while concomitantly doing so much to make everyone associated with it look like a cruel, racist, ignorant simpleton? Is it best to ignore him completely or to embrace him for what he is-- an egoist and/or idiot capable of making occasionally interesting art, possibly because of those views? There are, of course, those who dismiss any mention of him and those who treat his politics and deeds as though they stand separate from his music. (There are others who simply agree with him. Best of luck?) Some walk a middle ground with Vikernes, lambasting his views while lauding what his music has accomplished. He's become something of a meme, and when Metal Sucks covered the <a href=""http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/05/14/varg-vikernes-is-making-a-table-top-rpg/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""news""</a> that he is working on a role-playing game of his own, they aptly introduced him as the ""murdering bigot fuckhead Varg Vikernes."" There are, of course, no ultimately correct answers for such a difficult debate-- essentially, an argument not only about freedom of speech but the limits of art and of cults of personality. Coupled with <i>From the</i> <i>Depths of Darkness</i>, <i>Umskiptar</i> makes it easier to find a slightly more satisfying remedy: Varg Vikernes is, as advertised, ""a murdering bigot fuckhead"" whose string of interesting-to-important records has now faded into such formless, hapless bullshit that even Odin likely doesn't care. </p>
<p>That has to burn, Varg.</p></div>"|16640.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16640-umskiptar/|3.3|Grayson Currin

Lucas and Van Vliet approached the latter's old high school pal and kindred 1960s iconoclast-crank Frank Zappa to retrieve the master tapes of <i>Bat Chain Puller</i>, an album the Magic Band had recorded for Zappa's label in 1976, before a lawsuit with Zappa's then-manager Herb Cohen stopped its release. When asked about taking the masters back, Zappa flatly replied: ""I thought there might be a higher market value out there in 'BeefheartLand' if I didn't split up the set."" By this point, Zappa had held the tapes for over five years, and the Band needed to fill the side of their last album, 1982's <i>Ice Cream for Crow</i>, so Zappa cut them a deal: ""Well, I got a track about 12 minutes long called 'Do You Want a Pepsi?' Don sings on it. I wrote it."" Needless to say, they declined.</p>
<p>Zappa passed away in 1993 and Van Vliet retreated to the desert for the last decades of his life; the tapes never emerged. It seemed the hatchet had never been buried between these old friends. When John Fahey's Revenant label approached Zappa's estate to include this missing album as the last disc of the <i>Grow Fins</i> box, they were rebuffed with a ludicrously high fee. So when a review from Edwin Pouncey appeared in a recent issue of <i>The Wire</i> proclaiming the legitimacy of this disc, it still seemed unlikely that these could be the missing tapes. Another bootleg had been released earlier in the decade, a woeful-sounding disc called <i>Dust Sucker</i>, and even with both men gone, the argument seemed forever unresolved. </p>
<p class=""s1"">But lo and behold, this is the real <i>Bat Chain Puller</i>, as recorded in 1976 and released by a subsidiary of the Frank Zappa estate via <a href=""http://barfkoswill.shop.musictoday.com/Dept.aspx?cp=971_54317%20"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">their website</a>, complete with liner notes (and more importantly, approval) from longtime drummer John ""Drumbo"" French and guitarist Denny Walley. It was to be the album that would restore Captain Beefheart to critical acclaim after two loathsome cash grabs often attributed to ""The Tragic Band"" by his spurned devotees. In the lore of lost albums, <i>Bat Chain Puller</i> is the good Captain's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16000-the-smile-sessions/"" target=""_blank""><i>Smile</i></a>, a fragmented text never quite assembled. Six of these songs were reworked for the Captain's ""comeback"" album, 1978's <i>Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)</i>, another three were re-recorded for 1980's barbed <i>Doc at the Radar Station</i>, and two of the darkest tracks resurfaced on swan song <i>Ice Cream for Crow</i>.</p>
<p>For many listeners, Captain Beefheart has always been a hard, even taxing, listen. In the mid-1960s, the Magic Band's tough, aslant blues held promise for commercial success, but by the time of 1969's enigmatic and still-inscrutable double album, <i>Trout Mask Replica</i>, it seemed the kind of thing to be launched into space (whether that reads as a statement to scare off alien invasion or to find sympathetic intergalactic ears depends on your own perception of that album). By the early 1970s, after the playful yet prickly <i>Lick My Decals Off, Baby</i>, Van Vliet couldn't seem to cash in no matter how sweet and sharp his <i>Clear Spot</i> and <i>The Spotlight Kid</i> albums were.</p>
<p>Strangely, the first half of <i>Shiny Beast</i> might have been his most accessible album side, reminding fans of why they signed up with the Captain in the first place while hooking in new listeners with a cunning blend of surrealist lyrics, tricky rhythmic play, and latent melodicism. The title track is vintage Van Vliet, dappled with skronk and splatter, yet at the same time curiously subtle, with dribbles of synthesizer and a rhythm legendarily concocted from his car's windshield wipers. From there, an almost jazzy song called ""Seam Crooked Sam"" appears, with gentle guitar lines from John French following Van Vliet's poetic vision as closely as possible, no line or melody repeating or resolving. ""Harry Irene"" is a bittersweet, shuffling near-standard with an accordion solo from Walley, and features Beefheart at his most lyrically straight-ahead and nuanced. A grim spoken-word piece, ""81 Poop Hatch"", leads into a delicate guitar miniature titled ""Flavor Bud Living"".</p>
<p>It's only on ""Brick Bats"", with Van Vliet's adenoidal soprano Ornette shrieks and wails, that we're finally back in ""BeefheartLand."" The furious ""Floppy Boot Stomp"", with Jeff ""Moris"" Tepper's stinging slide guitar, imagines the Devil going down to Georgia years before Charlie Daniels did. And the blues rise up on ""Owed t'Alex"" with a Tepper solo reminiscent of Mick Taylor's slide work on <i>Sticky Fingers</i>. The disc's most beguiling moment is bonus track ""Hobo-Ism"", a stunning eight-minute acoustic blues cut with Walley that sounds like the follow-up to <i>Trout Mask</i>'s singular-in-the-canon country blues ""China Pig"". It's that all-too-rare glimpse at the Captain as the bluesman he always was at heart.</p>
<p>Yet historical perspective and what-ifs somewhat alter the perspective of this document. The album that was later re-recorded with a new band, <i>Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)</i>, put Beefheart back on the map just fine and was an adventurous blend of tropical swagger and spikiness. It remains one of his best-received albums of that decade. Perhaps the shelving of <i>Bat Chain Puller</i> better positioned Beefheart for the end of the decade, as it rendered him relevant and hinted at paternity to other artistically ""bent"" late-70s acts like Devo, Pere Ubu, and Public Image Ltd. (Curmudgeon that he was, the Captain naturally disavowed such ""children."") And the lean and whetted <i>Doc at the Radar Station</i> showed quirky new wavers how to really shatter notions of rhythm and rhyme (tales abound about rhythmic patterns gleaned from windshield wipers, dropped car keys, and courtside seats at Lakers' games).</p>
<p>Had <i>Bat Chain Puller</i> marked his return with its mix of blues shards and safe play and been greeted with open arms in the marketplace, it might have taken the edge off the man. By being spurned, Beefheart instead gave us three irascible, irreducible albums that marked the end of his discography. That he remains a totemic figure for two generations of our finest pop nonconformists speaks to Beefheart's influence still. It's hard to imagine the discographies of iconic folks like Tom Waits, Jack White, and PJ Harvey (not to mention adventurous sonic knot-makers like Sonic Youth, Pere Ubu, and Deerhoof) without him. Were it not for his cipher of African-American country blues, allowing for a personal absorption of that musical form rather than the regurgitation of 12-bar licks that now passes for the blues, our finest weirdoes might be living in ZappaWorld rather than BeefheartLand.</p></div>"|16625.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16625-bat-chain-puller/|8.2|Andy Beta

At times, when the level of intensity reached a cracked breaking point, it felt like a worthy successor to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/805-comets-on-fire/"">Comets on Fire</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1561-field-recordings-from-the-sun/""><i>Field Recordings From the Sun</i></a> had finally arrived. Elsewhere, they were channeling the wind-tunnel howl of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5395-hawkwind/"">Hawkwind</a>'s ""Silver Machine"", the weather-beaten sweetness of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4181-teenage-fanclub/"">Teenage Fanclub</a>'s <i>Bandwagonesque</i>, and the killer lo-fi guitar melodies of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1798-guided-by-voices/"">Guided by Voices</a> at their peak. If those seem like lofty comparisons, it's because <i>Voyagers of Legend</i> exuded a confidence seldom felt by a band so, well, so <i>young</i>. On this follow-up record, the band's first since inking a deal with <a href=""http://www.matadorrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Matador</a>, that boldness is retained and funneled into a cleaner, brighter take on the Young's sound. The psych-rock impulses have been dialed down and pushed into the background, making way for a stronger focus on classical songcraft.</p>
<p>As such, <i>Dub Egg</i> slots neatly alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/19785-kurt-vile/"">Kurt Vile</a>'s outstanding <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15174-smoke-ring-for-my-halo/""><i>Smoke Ring for My Halo</i></a> on the current Matador roster. Like Vile's work on that record, it feels like the Young's singer/guitarist Hans Zimmerman went through a process of attrition during the making of these songs, knocking out some of his artier impulses to burrow straight to the heart of his band's sound. Some of the reference points from <i>Voyagers of Legend</i> remain, but the work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/534-big-star/"">Big Star,</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4693-neil-young/"">Neil Young</a>, and even the irresistible boogie of early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7321-zz-top/"">ZZ Top</a> are the clearest forebears to much of this work. Occasionally, the Young's heroes threaten to eclipse them, especially when they edge a little too close to the ""Cinnamon Girl"" riff on ""Plunging Rollers"", or when Zimmerman lets his inner Robert Pollard get the better of him on ""Poisoned Hell"".</p>
<p>But there's an undeniable talent for forcefully pushing those influences into interesting places, where the band names, records, and song titles they're overtly referencing melt away through the sheer force of the Young's playing. The two songs that bookend the album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13169-livin-free/"">""Livin' Free""</a> and ""Talking to Rose"", combine gloriously churned guitar lines and starry-eyed vocal musings that demonstrate their knack for matching big dumb riffs with catchy pop melodies. There's a well-refined vision for this band lurking in the corners of <i>Dub Egg</i>, a feeling that this stuff is gradually congealing in a place that will be seen as their defining style. Due to the spirit of experimentation, the energy does fizzle out on occasion-- the dip into country-rock on ""Only Way Out"" is particularly ill-judged-- but that's likely to be a product of a band still finding its way.</p>
<p>This sense of fearlessness, which allows the group to push and pull its art in multiple directions just to see where it will lead, is matched by the brash, anthemic feel of much of the music. There's a cocky strut to tracks like ""Don't Hustle for Love"" and ""White Cloud"" that suggest this is a band striving to make a connection with a far wider audience. On <i>Dub Egg</i> they fall just short of those ambitions, creating a transitory album that builds on what came before but doesn't feel like the finished product. There's plenty here to suggest that Zimmerman has a spark to his songwriting that could help the Young achieve crossover status, and with Matador behind them they could get the promotional push they need, but ultimately this is an album where the kinks are still being ironed out, where the elements are still being assimilated, and where the direction of the band still feels a little too open-ended to get a full grasp on what they're trying to achieve.</p></div>"|16715.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16715-dub-egg/|6.3|Nick Neyland

All the while they were becoming <a href=""http://www.smokefairies.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Smoke Fairies</a>, or what Smoke Fairies would become, taking snippets of American blues and bits of folk music that had made that same Transatlantic journey and folding them in with their own more overtly modern sense of clear-eyed gloom.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was in those years that they fused into the two-headed swamp-siren they sound like today. On their first two releases (2010's <i>Ghosts</i>, an EP/singles collection, and their proper debut, <i>Through Low Light and Trees</i>) and especially their new one, <i>Blood Speaks</i>, Blamire and Davies, now based in London, don't trade vocal duties so much as appear to sing from the same body, their voices nearly indistinguishable, shifting between smoky moans and toe-curling trills. They perform and record with a band (percussion, piano, bass) and these days, after a few years on the road, they know how to incorporate all the other players at their disposal, but in general they seem to be fully ensconced within their own private plane of existence. It's easy to imagine them sharing a made-up language, secret handshakes, and rituals kept secret and only slyly giggled about in the presence of others.</p>
<p>Though Blamire and Davies' songs are about far less seamless unions-- unpretty, frayed at the edges, painfully human. There's a gritty, lucid vein running just below the top layer of haze, the words' bite stinging all the more for their burial under all those dank guitar tones and harmonies as dark and delicate as black lace. Ruminations on the bleaker side of romance dominate here-- not just breakups and missed connections, but the burdens of even the most functional affairs. ""Something dies when you fall in love/ And something lives when you've had enough of driving over the ice,"" sings Blamire (or maybe it's Davies?) on ""Take Me Down When You Go"". A number of these songs, like opener ""Let Me Know"", are gripped by warring senses of cool self-possession (""my destruction is mine to own"") and brain-addling lust (""I see you coming like a weight of bricks/ 'Cause I wanna kiss you after we call it quits""). ""On a day like this, I fight through the city I live in/ Hope that there's something left to give to you,"" goes ""Hideaway"", the line riding out a billowing cloud of shivering guitar and grinding bass.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Smoke Fairies have mined the painful parallels between people and places: ""I can't go back to Gastown/ …And I can't go back to you,"" Blamire lamented on ""Gastown"", the 2009 single the duo cut for Jack White's Third Man Records, which remains one of their most distinctive tracks: woozy, reeling verses slipping in and out of a strutting, bluesy chorus, lead along by Blamire and Davies' interlocking guitars, voices, everything. On the cover of that 7"", shot against Third Man's now-nearly-iconic royal blue, Smoke Fairies look almost like a novelty act: two pretty girls in cropped vintage dresses and leather booties, cradling big-bodied vintage electrics, coy and prim. But any appearance of naivety is a ruse. They know what they want and very slowly, very surely, they are going to take it from you.</p>
<p>It's hard not to wonder what sort of fantastic greasiness White may have been able to coax out of the band if he'd stuck around for a full album, but they've found a more than sympathetic ear in British producer Head, who's perhaps best known for his longstanding studio appointment with PJ Harvey. It's well established that he can handle chameleonic shifts-- but will Smoke Fairies also choose that as their route? Just a few degrees separate each of their releases so far, gradual shifts in depth and tone: a certain desperate urgency falling away in favor of an ominous languor; Blamire and Davies' dueling guitars, once nimble and clean, now shrouded in a mist, muggy and ancient, like some unholy union of Fairport Convention and Colour Haze. If they continue at this rate, their best records may render <i>Blood Speaks</i> a quaint stranger, recognizable only for the force at its core.</p></div>"|16783.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16783-blood-speaks/|7.2|Rachael Maddux

It's typically reserved for someone like <a href=""http://www.laurelhalo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Laurel Halo</a>, who's darted and dashed rather than having followed a simple trajectory over the past couple of years, recording a vast and diverse amount of material under her own name and as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30337-king-felix/"" target=""_blank"">King Felix</a> for six record labels (and counting). Her Hyperdub debut, <i>Quarantine</i>, appears to acknowledge the need for something definitive, and by intricately arranging and shrewdly sequencing her C.V. on a micro scale, it's her best and most cohesive work to date. And it's largely because Halo finds her voice in a literal sense. She foregrounds vocals to a far greater extent than on her previous material, and while <i>Quarantine </i>veers from claustrophobic sci-fi dioramas to meditative synth drones to nakedly expressive confessionals, it's unified by an underlying perspective and personality that commands attention yet still leaves plenty to the imagination.</p>
<p>You find out fairly quickly that Halo is setting all the rules of engagement on <i>Quarantine</i>.  Opener ""Airsick"" introduces many of the tricks Halo uses from there on out-- oddly stacked and constantly shifting harmonies, portamento pitch-bending, narcotic melodies, a prevailing sense of technological dread-- before the nearly a cappella ""Years"" leaves her completely exposed. Halo doesn't exactly yell or scream on ""Years"", it's something like a boundary-pushing exhalation after a long and self-imposed silence, sung in an uncomfortably loud and flat tone. Some will find it, to put it lightly, hard to deal with, and by most standard metrics of evaluation, it's not <i>proper </i>singing and borders on ugly. But consider the combative content of the lyrics: ""I will never see you again/ You're mad 'cause I will not leave you alone."" There's purpose to all of this, reminding me of Jeff Mangum's approach on the opening devotional from ""King of Carrot Flowers, Pt. 2 &amp; 3"", where the volume signifies an artist pushing against internal and external repression with necessary, confrontational force.</p>
<p>Halo's vocals only occasionally go back into attack mode, but ""Years"" is indicative of <i>Quarantine</i>'s prodding and provoking nature and how it subverts the typical ideas of how we brand aggressive and intense music. The instruments of war are almost completely absent here: The digital dissonance is rarely abrasive, there's nothing resembling a true bassline, nor is there anything that scans as a snare or kick drum perhaps outside of the almost tropical pitter-patter outlining ""Airsick"", or the jetstream whir of ""Thaw"". If anything, it resembles the beatless, zero-gravity voids created by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14326-returnal/"" target=""_blank"">Oneohtrix Point Never on <i>Returnal</i></a>, and similarly, the extraterrestrial quality of <i>Quarantine</i>'s terrain heightens your senses and makes your nerves sit a little more on edge to counter the unfamiliarity.   </p>
<p>Though often melodic, it doesn't really ever come off as pop. My experience with <i>Quarantine </i>feels more like an interactive, multimedia affair, as though I'm listening to a record while simultaneously trying to solve a puzzle or challenge the CPU in a video game. I don't hear verses and choruses so much as Q&amp;A, stimuli, and open-ended responses, challenges presented, accepted, and accomplished. I can't really hum the melody of ""MK Ultra""; the thrill is in finally being able to trace its strange, boomeranging path in real time. The tension created by the juddering undercurrent of low frequencies and Halo's octave-shifted vocals on ""Carcass"" is unnerving enough, and her use of the phrase ""my carcass"" rather than ""my body"" intends to provoke an entirely different and gnarlier set of emotional responses. </p>
<p>Indeed, while much of <i>Quarantine</i>'<i>s </i>futuristic production and man-machine interface conjures science fiction, much of the lyrical approach reads like scientific or Socratic method. Beyond the blurry delineation between devotion and revenge on ""Years"", what to make of something like ""Holoday""? Structurally, it feels like an interlude, a free-time juxtaposition of scrambled circuitry and a high-pitched sample of Halo singing, ""just wanna be with you!"" like an errant, synaptic trigger. Is it a love song or a neurological study of the feeling? Likewise, it certainly has to be intentional that the titles signifying expressions of rapture (""Wow"", ""Joy"") are given to compositions in thrall to the dehumanization of Halo's voice. The most pointed example of Halo's painstaking production appears on ""Tumor"": The illuminant vocal processing accompanying the lyrics, ""Caught behind the wall of tears/ Distorted liquid image of you/ The signal keeps cutting out but one thing is clear/ Nothing grows in my heart, there is no one here,"" evokes a radiant sadness. Seconds later, stripped of all effects and affects, Halo menacingly deadpans to the object of her desire, ""you are my target.""</p>
<p>There are plenty of disarmingly pretty moments too on <i>Quarantine</i>, yet even those strive for unsettling effect, finding beauty in uncertainty, confidence in the embrace of the unknown. There are already subtle hints at discord during the spacey lullaby of ""Thaw"", milky synths and samples beaming in and out of an odd time signature as Halo sings in a strangely conversational timbre, ""Don't get addicted to anything/ Just keep on walking/ One foot in front of the other/ Forward motion's the only answer."" The closing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13444-light-and-space/"" target=""_blank"">""Light + Space""</a> is <i>Quarantine</i>'s most conventionally performed keys-and-voice piece and also the most gorgeous, though a rare glimpse at Halo's more lush, jazzy phrasing is dedicated to the admission that ""words are just words that you soon forget."" Coming at the tail end of a diffuse, exploratory second half, it's a disquieting and ultimately weighty epigram for <i>Quarantine­</i>, a record created in the image of its author in its ability to dodge easy explanations and comparisons. After all, the greatest pleasure of <i>Quarantine </i>lies in its being a world unto itself, a self-contained vortex where influence is nearly impossible to project or extract, leaving only the alternately frightening and reassuring state of solitude.</p></div>"|16692.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16692-quarantine/|8.0|Ian Cohen

Although the source material varied, and the Zero Boys song sounded slicker than the raw original, the band managed to unify the tracks with one consistent, stomping, Hives-ian aesthetic. The EP showed that maybe the band that flopped after their initial success in 2001 could deliver a solid follow-up to 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10904-the-black-and-white-album/"" target=""_blank""><i>Black and White Album</i></a>.</p>
<p>Instead, we get <i>Lex Hives</i>. Just a few tracks into their fifth long-player, it's clear that they don't achieve the same level of cohesion. Yes, they make the logical first step with ""Come On!"", a hyper-repetitive, fast, short pump-up album opener, featuring a canned clip of a cheering crowd. And honestly, it's tough to imagine a more depressing sound than the hollow visage of a fake crowd cheering on a group of guys repeatedly, enthusiastically singing the words ""come on."" Later, they try a barroom blues with ""I Want More""-- musically, it drags, and lyrically, it's a lazy caricature of greed. ""Without the Money"" is an organ-led ballad with a riff that's way too similar to Screamin' Jay Hawkins' ""I Put a Spell on You"". They go for robotic new wave on ""Wait a Minute"" and ""Go Right Ahead"", both of which are gratingly repetitive. On the latter, frontman Pelle Almqvist tries and fails to pull off the line ""We're gonna drink, fuck, and fight all night."" (Although the negatives far outweigh the positives, there are good moments here like ""Midnight Shifter"", an enjoyable jukebox party song with handclaps and a saxophone that's organized like an early 1960s Atlantic R&amp;B single.)</p>
<p>Maybe the album's sonic shifts can be blamed on the band's recording conditions: Over the course of two years, they recorded the album in several different studios with eight engineers. And the bigger issue than the directionless nature of the album is the way-too-clean production. Of course it's wonderful that the Hives can make a record that's clear-eyed and hi-fi, but sometimes it glistens to a fault. ""Patrolling Days"" leads with an aggressive punk riff, and right near the top of the song, Almqvist lets out a ""woo woo!"" Now normally, any ""woo"" that accompanies a series of power chords sounds wild, off-the-cuff, and buried beneath the guitar barrage. Here, the ""woo"" is placed directly at the top of the mix and sounds rehearsed, removing any spur-of-the-moment power. Most of the harmony vocals face a similar problem; they're scrubbed of any personality and, again, become a focal point due to their prominence in the mix. The end result? A rock album that sounds entirely manufactured.</p>
<p>Almost 20 years and five albums in, it's got to be tough to be the Hives. As a gritty garage band, they were never exactly convincing. And despite a handful of undeniable hits, the matching suits thing probably made them ""too weird"" to gain any traction as a radio rock band. <i>Lex Hives</i> might be their way of experimenting to see what sound sticks, but at this point in their career, they should already have that part figured out.</p></div>"|16703.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16703-lex-hives/|4.8|Evan Minsker

He's obviously having a blast, but his mother isn't so into it: ""He's going ballistic, scaring his sister/ Now I need this nonsense to end."" It's an endearing tableau, a portrait of the artist as a young air drummer, but it has a slightly more intriguing implication for Monroe's album. As a day job, the Mississippi native is a multi-instrumentalist in Band of Horses, and ""Doritoys"" (Monroe is not very good with titles) suggests he understands changing from a sideman to a solo artist involves a great deal of pretending. He may have a big-name producer and a well-stocked studio, but Monroe seems to suspect that he hasn't progressed terribly far from that <a href=""http://bighassle.com/wp-content/files_mf/1337102860press11.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rambunctious kid</a> driving his mother crazy.</p>
<p>There's something affably self-deprecating about that attitude, which lends <i>A Painting of a Painting on Fire</i> a breezier, easier-going feel than you might expect. Even when he gets real and sings about drug addicts and war, there's a tacit acknowledgement that he's never taking the enterprise too seriously. The album needs that. Monroe reportedly wrote hundreds of songs while backing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6993-ben-bridwell/"" target=""_blank"">Ben Bridwell</a> (himself a sideman gone solo), but it wasn't until a recent break in touring that he booked a studio and hammered them out with producer Chris Testa (P!nk, Matchbox 20). A giddy sense of discovery permeates the music, as though the kid just got a studio for Christmas. Of course he played all the instruments. He's not going to share his toys.</p>
<p>Monroe isn't cribbing from his boss and making earnest indie rock anthems. Instead, he plays a hyperactive brand of 1970s rock, full of big, shiny melodies and eager riffs. Much like the character in ""Doritoys"", he is openly imitating his rock idols. ""Any Way, Shape, or Deformity"" quotes the filtered vocals directly from ELO; ""Turning Over Leaves"" scavenges a little bit of <i>Schmilsson</i>; and ""On the Beach"" bounces energetically along like early Cheap Trick. Monroe's enthusiasm for these old sounds is obvious: He understands what makes these artists fun, and uses the touchstones to instill <i>Painting</i> with a percolating energy that doesn't wind down until well into side two.</p>
<p>Still, you can hear the strain. Monroe arranges the songs to sound impressively busy, with every single space filled with a fuzzed-out guitar, a vocoded refrain, or a vintage synthesizer. At times it plays like a multi-instrumentalist's demo reel, intended to showcase the range and variety of his talents. There's a fairly unadventurous sense of adventure to his borrowings, which highlights instead of compensates for his everyman vocals and truncated hooks. To say that Monroe isn't treading new ground, however, might be missing the point. If emulation is his aim, then his aim is true enough. And there's nothing wrong with patterning yourself after your heroes or singing into a hairbrush. But with so many other artists mining similar veins of influence-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14734-to-dreamers/"">Kelley Stoltz</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16181-hymns/"">Cardinal</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15036-the-year-of-magical-drinking/"">Apex Manor</a>, and even the gloriously shameless <a href=""http://youtu.be/Sv6dMFF_yts"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fun.</a>-- Monroe needs more than simple exuberance to distinguish himself.</p></div>"|16649.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16649-a-painting-of-a-painting-on-fire/|6.1|Stephen M.

It's an album from an artist who has improved the overall direction of his music, but who still has room to grow as an MC. <i>Hope in Dirt City </i>is not a great album-- and there are more than a few moments that make me wince-- but as much I want to dismiss it, I'm left with the sense that Pemberton is working toward something, and that he's fearless enough to one day achieve it. The album itself is no endgame, but transitions have gone far worse.</p>
<p>For <i>Hope in Dirt City</i>, Pemberton has thankfully ditched the flimsy, starter-kit electro of 2008's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11242-afterparty-babies/"" target=""_blank""><i>Afterparty Babies</i></a>. Instead we get warm, live instrumentation and tasteful, fruitful dips into 2-tone (""Small Deaths""), the synths of deep-house (""There We Go""), the pink-hued funk of <i>Vice</i><i> City</i> (""Hope in Dirt City""), and a palate-cleansing <i>Madvillainy </i>homage (""Cheval""). The beats here are often jazzy, and even when that jazziness turns into outright skronk on a song like ""Jukebox"", the production rewards immersion. Despite the slight genre experiments, there's a looseness to the playing that holds everything together.</p>
<p>As impressive and encouraging as the production is, Pemberton's rapping isn't up to snuff. He's still overly dry and often noticeably amateurish, and he sometimes pushes himself to do things he can't. On opener ""Get on Down"", for instance, he kicks off the chorus by awkwardly spelling out his name and then continues to trip all over himself during the second verse as he tries to speed up his flow. Other times, like on ""There We Go"" or ""Hope in Dirt City"", he'll fall into a flow that's much closer to talking than rapping. There are also a few choruses that show off how unpolished he can be as a writer, be it when he devolves into screaming (""Jukebox"") or when he introduces a melody that clashes with the rest of the song (the title track, ""No More Names [Aditi]""). Likewise, his writing doesn't offer much to grab onto: The album focuses mostly on boys chasing girls, but his critical eye fails to do much to illuminate either his life or the listener's.</p>
<p>Pemberton is a rap outsider, and one of the positive things to take away from <i>Hope in Dirt City </i>is that this may have given him the license and the freedom to let the listener watch him figure himself out. Not all of his targets are hit, but there are moments here where you can squint and see something that could be built upon. The notable example is the single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13524-conditioning-grimes-remix/"" target=""_blank"">""Conditioning""</a>, which in its second half features the best honest-to-goodness singing on the album. Pemberton's vocals are impassioned, but he also perfectly harnesses the range of his voice, lilting at the end of a few lines into a falsetto while growling as he delivers others. He hits that same sweet spot in the album's final minute as well, allowing the record to at least close with its best foot forward. Rapping becomes singing becomes screaming with a fluid sonic identity to match, and though there are some misses, the process itself provides its own fleeting charms.</p></div>"|16694.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16694-hope-in-dirt-city/|6.0|Jordan Sargent

Back in 2010, the British rockers released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14442-serotonin/"" target=""_blank""><i>Serotonin</i></a>, an album packed with sparkling, glammy stadium-pop gems to rival Brandon Flowers' most cocksure feather-jacketed highs. Taking into consideration the ramshackle funhouse guitar pop of the band's 2006 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5686-making-dens/"" target=""_blank""><i>Making Dens</i></a>, the shift toward such shiny stuff was surprising-- the amount of added polish was especially noticeable (even for a band that's always sounded relatively put-together in the production department)-- but it was a new look that they wore well. They didn't become megastars, not even close, but they certainly did a decent job of sounding the part.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Mystery Jets have frequently worn their musical inspirations on their sleeves (see: the Cars-biting, JCPenney commercial-soundtracking <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2Dl3VQ2K2U"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Two Doors Down""</a>, from 2008's uneven <i>Twenty One</i>), they've also always travelled at their own pace, out of step with everyone except their own whims and with moderate critical success. Naturally, then, their fourth album, <i>Radlands</i>, finds the band leaving the glitzy rafter-reaching attitude of <i>Serotonin</i> more or less in the dust. Ironically, in favor of <i>more dust</i>, since they chose to decamp to Texas to work on the lion's share of the album.</p>
<p>As frontman Blaine Harrison explains in a press release, the album's title is a Pizza Hut/Taco Bell portmanteau of the names of enigmatic director Terence Malick's first film, 1973's <i>Badlands</i>, and the name of Keith Richards' notorious Redlands estate house. Despite its title, <i>Radlands</i> isn't breathtakingly cinematic, nor is it the scene of an urban legend concerning Marianne Faithfull and a candy bar; quite simply, it's a ""Coming to America"" statement, one that arrives with acoustic guitars, countryish melodies, gospel choirs, and a convoluted fictional narrative involving a nomadic cowboy-dressed musician that apparently needed its own limited-run comic book just to tell its story.</p>
<p>If the idea of a British (and very British-sounding) band pairing its notions of Americana with a loosely drawn conceptual arc sounds like it's been done before, it's because it has been-- by the Killers. Those Actual Americans and British Big Deals previously attempted to conjure a Springsteenian vibe from their better-with-age 2006 LP <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9484-sams-town/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sam's Town</i></a>, which was frequently felled by its own sword of false pretension. Harrison and his band's heads aren't as in-the-clouds as Flowers', so their approach on <i>Radlands</i> is decidedly more modest-- self-defeating, actually, when taking into account the first lyric uttered on the album's opening title track: ""I've heard there's a place where we go to die/ It's a terribly overrated horseshit-shaped hole in the sky.""</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that opening salvo is as cheeky as things get in <i>Radlands</i> country, the other attempt at good-natured humor being ""Greatest Hits"", an obnoxious ripoff of Stealers Wheel's ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" that name-checks tons of album titles (that is, except the record itself that it rips off) while lamenting a failed relationship. The problem with <i>Radlands</i> is that, armed with the potential to go wild with a new bag of tricks, Mystery Jets often become as conservatively minded as parts of the state whose outline graces the album's cover.</p>
<p>The limp, shuffling duet ""Take Me Where the Roses Go"" is as innocuously bland as the state flower anthem it could potentially pass for, the warm guitar bends of ""The Ballad of Emmerson Lonestar"" fail to hide the song's ill-fitting cowboy boots, and the limp, spacey ""The Nothing"" sounds exactly as its title suggests. Dan Carey, who's worked with artists like Franz Ferdinand and Kylie Minogue, manned the production boards for this one, and it's not impossible to imagine him daydreaming about the more interesting bullet points on his CV as the band plays on.</p>
<p>There are a few reminders of past glories on <i>Radlands</i>-- specifically, the sassy glam jangle of ""The Hale Bop"", as well as the album's closing trio of pomp-rock histrionics, ""Sister Everett"", ""Lost in Austin"", and ""Luminescence"". Early on, ""Someone Purer"" serves nicely as a stop-start-stop-start-and-then-chug-on-and-on rocker, but one passionately delivered line that's let go from Harrison's lips rings cornily and loudly: ""Deliver me from sin/ And give me rock'n'roll."" Sadly, if there's irony hidden in that line, I can't find it.</p></div>"|16705.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16705-radlands/|5.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

She acted in a Jean-Luc Godard film, appearing in his 2010 videotape polemic </span><i>Film Socialisme</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> and, in a highbrow/lowbrow swivel, then later made her television acting debut in an episode of </span><i>Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">. She wrote her first memoir, </span><i>Just Kids</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, a chronicle of her ardent friendship with Robert Mapplethorpe, which earned a National Book Award and critical acclaim. And-- a proud autodidact all her life-- Smith even belatedly racked up a few college degrees, so to speak, receiving honorary doctorates from Rowan University (she dropped out in 1967) and the Pratt Institute. All in all, a pretty average couple of years in the life of Patti Smith, who's spent decade after decade ticking a red pencil against her chin, circling uncharted waters like want ads, and setting sail.</span></p>
<p>Much like the years during which she was working on it in fits and starts, <i>Banga</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is a hodgepodge. A song about Amerigo Vespucci comes a few minutes before an elegy for Amy Winehouse; an idyllic ballad inspired by Nikolai Gogol rubs track-list elbows with an idyllic ballad written as a birthday present for Johnny Depp. And all the while Smith scatters handfuls of references to ""the future"" and ""the 21st century"" across </span><i>Banga</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, suffusing the record with a palpable sense of futurity, horizon-gazing, and, yes, hope. Still, its bright, guitar-driven sound is even-keeled enough to make its motley cast of characters and jumbled, all-over-the-place temporality feel oddly cohesive, as though its parts were carefully fused together in a room where the clock has no hands. Remember those words that shot out of her lips like hot lightning on her brilliant 1978 record </span><i>Easter</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">: ""I don't fuck much with the past, but I fuck plenty with the future."" Well, more than three decades later, </span><i>Banga</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is the work of someone interested in fucking with everything.</span></p>
<p>Smith's earliest and most iconic albums were animated by her explosive, dribbling vocal style (""If you miss a beat, make up another,"" Sam Shepard once advised a nervous Smith before an early theater performance, and everything about her method of singing proves she took those words to heart), but what we've learned over her past few records is that Smith's molten lava delivery has cooled off a bit with age. Which means that the longer, spoken-word pieces on <i>Banga</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">-- the underworld swirl of ""Constantine's Dream"" or the stoic ""Tarkovsky (The Second Stop Is Jupiter)""-- don't careen with the breakneck energy of, say, </span><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7277-horses-30th-anniversary-legacy-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Horses</i></a><span style=""font-style: normal;"">' centerpiece reveries of ""Land, of a Thousand Dances"" and ""La Mer (De)"". Smith's now got one of those speaking voices that-- like Werner Herzog playing God in voiceover-- lends a cosmic gravity to every word she utters, even when she's improvising. This occasionally makes the denser and more conceptual lines feel leaden (""Constantine"" begins, ""In Arezzo I dreamed a dream/ Of Saint Francis who kneeled and prayed""), but there's something wonderful about the way it's etched certain lingering qualities of her idiosyncratic vocal thumbprint in stone. For all its imagery of Mercury and magpies, I think ""Tarkovsky""'s most humanizing charm to be that Smith still pronounces ""wuter"" with a New Jersey accent.</span></p>
<p><i>Banga</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> meditates on ideas about exploration and adventure, and though the longer tracks tackle these themes more explicitly (the 11-minute ""Constantine"" was inspired, serendipitously, by a postcard she received of a Dimitri Levas painting of a conquistador), it's actually the shorter, less assuming tracks that best capture that spirit of discovery. The opener ""Amerigo""-- which reimagines Vespucci taking a more sympathetic view of the indigenous people of his ""new"" continent-- has an infectiously buoyant energy that doesn't distract from its political consciousness. The same could be said of the driving, scaled-mountain intensity of ""Fuji-san"", which Smith wrote in the wake of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan. The elegies-- ""This Is the Girl"" for Winehouse and ""Maria"" for the late French actress Maria Schneider-- are sweet, desolate, and fittingly understated. (""It is a song I wish we never had to write,"" Smith says of ""Girl"" in the liner notes.) Smith overstates </span><i>Banga</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">'s overarching themes on the final track, a cover of Neil Young's ""After the Gold Rush"" that's smooth sailing until a small children's choir storms the helm at the end to sing, ""Look at mother nature on the run in the 21st century."" It's a moment of respite from the somber ""Costantine"" that precedes it, but-- especially coming from someone as cliché-obliterating as Smith-- it feels uncharacteristically heavy-handed.</span></p>
<p>Though neither a high point nor a low point in her freewheeling, four-decade career, <i>Banga</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> has the same charm of Smith's best albums: It flits with the impressionistic fascinations of a single mind. Even now that she's got those honorary Ph.Ds, Smith is still the eternal college freshman at heart, constantly stumbling upon new artistic heroes and then drawing from them fathomless and unabashedly ebullient inspiration. </span><i>Horses</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> tacked upon its walls cut-out, doodled-upon photos of Arthur Rimbaud, William S. Burroughs, and Bob Dylan; </span><i>Easter </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">subbed them out for Jackson Pollock, Jimi Hendrix, and Jesus Christ; and </span><i>Banga</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> keeps the cycle going (though with a decidedly Russian flair) with Tarkovsky, Gogol, and Mikhail Bulgakov (the record's title is the name of the dog in </span><i>Master and Margarita</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, a book with which Smith says she was ""smitten"" when she first read it four years ago). Ultimately, it's </span><i>Banga</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">'s earnestness about the thrill of discovery that makes it feel so out-of-time and refreshing. It runs counter to that sense of maxed-out ennui that governs the way so many people talk about art and artists in the age of Wikipedia-- when posturing that you know it all is more attractive than confessing blind spots, if only so you can bemoan the fact that it's all been done before. Though more in spirit than in sound, </span><i>Banga</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> pulses with the notion that there are still good books we haven't read, old ideas waiting to be fucked with, and new lands we haven't yet explored.</span></p></div>"|16693.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16693-banga/|7.1|Lindsay Zoladz

It belongs to Wale, who informs us: ""We blessed to be here/ It's a blessing for you to be here with us."" This is not an auspicious start to Spitta's first major-label studio effort since 2011's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15591-weekend-at-burnies/"" target=""_blank""><i>Weekend at Burnie</i><i>'s</i></a>. A distant universe ago, Wale seemed likable enough, but over the years his persona has curdled; he currently resembles the cartoonish Asshole Boyfriend character in your average teen sex comedy. If rap were high school, he and Curren$y would never hang out together.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13397-what-it-look-like-ft-wale/"" target=""_blank"">""What It Look Like""</a>, the song that Wale snickers all over (he's also acquired a repellent habit of pausing to chuckle at all his own lines) is otherwise a fine example of the sort of song Curren$y has made his career perfecting: languid, precise rapping unspooling generously over high-thread-count, lush jazz-funk music. In fact, the second Curren$y reclaims the spotlight from his guest on the second verse, things snap into focus, or rather dilate back out-- Curren$y's music is best experienced through a dim glow-- and stays there. Apart from this buzz-harshing moment, <i>The Stoned Immaculate</i> proceeds apace, and you can feel the air clear, everyone settle down. Relax: This is going to be another Curren$y album.</p>
<p>Reviewing new Curren$y albums has, in a way, become a diminishing-returns exercise: He has long settled into a groove that hardly rewards fresh commentary. If you have listened to one Curren$y release since 2010, there are zero earth-shaking revelations to impart. Apart from minor costume changes from project to project-- Curren$y with Alchemist; Curren$y with Styles P; Curren$y over Ski Beatz-- his releases are beginning to blur together, even, in some cases, inducing déjà vu. I found myself double-taking at the song called ""Jet Life"" that ends <i>The Stoned Immaculate</i>, for instance; surely he'd gotten to that title before now?</p>
<p>But the critic's curse is the listener's boon: Curren$y has put out enough good music in this vein since 2010 to fill up a Jet Life-only iPod, one you could easily hit ""shuffle"" on and nod your head drowsily to for uninterrupted hours. And though his focus is narrow, Curren$y has yet to repeat himself. Instead he homes in-- on the perfect simile for his weed, the best description of his car seats, the funniest deadpan insult. <i>The Stoned Immaculate</i> is packed with sly, pullback-worthy lines: On ""Showroom"" he checks his email on his iPad and tells us its ""full of condo prices."" On ""Take You There"", he's ""smoking on something strong as my vivid imagination."" On ""No Squares"", he's chasing the money down ""like it key-scratched my Impala."" Like all lifestyle-music rappers, Curren$y's lyrics drip with nice things, and the joy that comes from fondly describing them. But the language he brings to them exists in its own universe.</p>
<p>And then there's his voice. The old cliché about sounding good reciting the phone book comes to mind. Especially when he appears to be actually reading from <i>The Blue Book</i>, as on this opening lyric from ""Showroom"": ""When the speedometer read 70 miles per hour, a spoiler is deployed from the trunk/ Less wheel resistance, more power."" The line reads laughably leaden on the page, but coming from Curren$y, it runs like honey off a spoon.</p>
<p>He also almost never lets a beat show his bad side. Monsta Beatz builds him a heavily scented opium den on ""Armoire"". He sounds at home in it. Pharrell revisits the kind of lounge-cheese he specialized in circa 2005 with ""Chasin' Paper"". He sounds at home there, too. On ""Sunroof"", Spitta even finds his way around some strange, squint-inducing Mariachi MIDI music. You just can't catch this guy out.</p>
<p>There are other guests on this album besides Wale, but none of them disturbs the atmosphere as he does. Estelle, obscured by weed clouds, sings an aching hook for the modest love song ""That's the Thing"". 2 Chainz downshifts into his ""laid-back"" mode for the jazz flute-flecked after-hours number ""Capitol"". No one gets too worked up. Everyone has a good time. There is nothing at stake in Curren$y's music. When the album is over, everyone exits his den, squinting. When he returns, a few months from now, with another release, we'll all find our way to our particular spots on that couch again and settle in. It's always a pleasure.</p></div>"|16699.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16699-the-stoned-immaculate/|7.1|Jayson Greene

It seems like in the past every mention of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/killcrocodiles"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crocodiles</a> triggered a Jesus and Mary Chain or Echo and the Bunnymen comparison, but while I listen to the San Diego band's third album, <i>Endless Flowers</i>, all I keep thinking about is a Drake song. Don't get me wrong, Crocodiles still rely on bleary guitar distortion, Brandon Welchez's vocals perpetually stuck between a yawn and a sneer, sneaky pilfering of the Spector catalog, and almost nothing else, so no one will confuse <i>Endless Flowers </i>for, say, ""Crew Love"". But I remember back when Drake used the line, ""I'm trying to do better than good enough,"" part of which also doubles as <a href=""http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1641587/drake-better-than-good-enough-documentary-watch-exclusive-preview-here.jhtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the title for his documentary</a>, and that phrase echoes throughout this record because, well, it speaks to why <i>Endless Flowers </i>is Crocodiles' best album and also their most frustrating. They're simply trying to do good enough and no more.</p>
<p>In other words, while Welchez and company haven't gotten any more ambitious over the past few years, they have refined their craft to the point of foolproofing. The mere presence of titles like ""Electric Death Song"" and ""Bubblegum Trash"" are evidence enough that Crocodiles know exactly what they're bringing to the table, and indeed <i>Endless Flowers </i>intends to lead the current pack in terms of dressing up 60s pop confection in studded leather. You can largely attribute it to their increasingly spiffy production; Simian Mobile Disco's James Ford set the band's trajectory on the right path with 2010's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14645-sleep-forever/"" target=""_blank"">Sleep Forever</a> </i>by forefronting melody rather than murk and as their first LP recorded as a five piece, <i>Endless Flowers </i>follows its lead, its most notable addition being that of a sunny disposition (compare this album title to the previous two). </p>
<p>It's debatable whether Crocodiles are unerringly consistent because they've simply gotten better or because they're hitting bullseyes on increasingly wide targets with all these brisk tempos, agreeable major keys, tried-and-true song structures, and wide-angle melodies that crest, resolve, and hit 7th-notes like they couldn't be composed any other way. Aficionados of Spector pop could probably nerd out trying to spot the references like soul fans listening to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4365-donuts/"" target=""_blank""><i>Donuts</i></a>, although ""Welcome Trouble"" turns its title into double entendre by all but stealing the riff from Wilco's ""Outtasite (Outta Mind)"". And while the hard-charging title track and ""Dark Alleys"" still conjure the received image of rugged motorcycle culture vis-à-vis emaciated Brits, these aren't for choppers, it's more the sort of thing that's equipped to sound good in Hondas or attempt to sell them.</p>
<p>And it should ultimately play well to those of us who think the first Black Rebel Motorcycle Club record has stood the test of time. Yet by focusing on such a specific set of influences, <i>Endless Flowers </i>feels incapable of any sort of genuine revelation: When the rounds of female backup vocals tart up ""My Surfing Lucifer"", ""No Black Clouds for Dee Dee"" spikes the prom-pop punch, ""Dark Alleys"" hits the Autobahn, or ""Hung Up 0n a Flower"" trudges through six minutes of ""fly""/""high""/""lie"" rhymes, they have an air of inevitability rather than surprise, and Crocodiles come off like a band that's been living off an artistic trust fund from Jason Pierce.</p>
<p>It's ultimately a testament to the perks and limitations of ""record collector rock,"" but not in the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16636-words-and-music-by-saint-etienne/"" target=""_blank"">Saint Etienne</a> explore how human beings deal with music as their primary form of social interaction. You know what Welchez likely listens to in his spare time, but you never quite catch what they do for him or where Crocodiles see themselves within the lineage. His vocals bray without actually projecting much and it's unfortunate that out of everything Welchez says on <i>Endless Flowers</i>, a bashful admission like, ""If you were a daisy/ Thirsting for a fix/ I'd gladly be the dew"" from ""No Black Clouds For Dee Dee"" is pretty much the only one that strikes an emotional chord because the title lets us know it's about a real person (Welchez's wife, Dum Dum Girls leader Dee Dee). More pertinent is <i>Endless Flowers'</i> introductory line of ""I'm waiting here with my tear/ On a crooked staircase with this melody,"" which could be read as an acknowledgement <i>Endless Flowers</i> exists mostly within the realm of vinyl grooves and sleeves rather than flesh and blood.</p></div>"|16698.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16698-endless-flowers/|6.5|Ian Cohen

It's simple but true: Music before Timbaland sounded different from music after him. You could say the same thing about <a href=""http://www.dntelmusic.com/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dntel</a>, albeit on a smaller scale. In 2001, he released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15950-dntel-life-is-full-of-possibilities/"" target=""_blank""><i>Life Is Full of Possibilities</i></a>, an album that reconciled twinkly, romantic indie pop with electronic glitch. A couple of years later, he collaborated with Death Cab for Cutie's Ben Gibbard on an album called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6432-give-up/"" target=""_blank""><i>Give Up</i></a>, credited to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3377-the-postal-service/"" target=""_blank"">the Postal Service</a>. By then, plenty of artists had brought electronics into the bedroom-- they called it IDM: ""intelligent dance music."" <i>Give Up</i> wasn't intelligent. Actually, it was sort of dumb. But in dumbness lie hot, basic, and universal emotions. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"" target=""_blank"">Boards of Canada</a> were Ph.Ds by comparison; the Postal Service was for first kisses.</p>
<p>This was Dntel's Timbaland moment: If you knew how to listen, you could hear the Postal Service and their imitators everywhere, and the more your heard their sound, the less you could really call it theirs-- it seemed to belong to the ether. It was crisp, friendly, and progressive, but not too progressive; too progressive is frightening. It was everything you ever wanted in a last-minute holiday sale/corporate shipping service/laserjet printer.</p>
<p>Times changed; Dntel, less so. <i>Aimlessness</i>, his third album of new material, arrives without context, scene, or convenient narrative. Like <i>Possibilities</i>, the album is a mix of instrumental and collaborations with guest vocalists. In 2001, this meant artists like Gibbard, the dude from Beachwood Sparks, and Mia Doi Todd; now it means Baths and Nite Jewel-- probably the closest kin Dntel has in the contemporary landscape.</p>
<p>Here, though, it's the instrumentals that hold up best. Dntel's sound is of the <a href=""http://www.foreigncupid.com/joomla/images/hummel%20umbrella%20boy.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hummel figurine</a> variety: highly detailed but essentially small. Adorbs, you might say. Jazzy, house-influenced tracks like ""Bright Night""-- tracks that might sound huge in someone else's hands-- are recast as pocket-sized miniatures. About three quarters of the way through the overlapping, Philip Glass-style keyboard patterns of ""Puma"", the track drops into total silence for a few seconds, then flashes dramatically back to life with a Moog solo. It sounds sort of like a mosquito.</p>
<p>The smallness isn't a bad thing. On some level, Dntel continues to play directly into the Peter Pan-ism of people in their 20s and early 30s-- a kind of refusal to give up on the world at its cutest. Here he reminds us he may have also been partially responsible for that thing called chillwave. But think of the way your smartphone is basically a tiny computer: Smallness is a metaphor for cute, but also for efficiency and containment.</p>
<p>Measuring Dntel based on his past achievements is a cruel but natural response: Given that he changed the conversation once, isn't it reasonable we might assume he'd do it again? <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/inbox/8795-the-curious-case-of-lil-b/"">When answering a question about ""new directions"" for our Inbox feature</a>, I wrote that today's innovation is tomorrow's cliché. I stand by that. The question I have when I sit down and listen to <i>Aimlessness</i> is: What's left of an artist once the novelty of his work falls away? No doubt there are all kinds of hammy, vague answers like ""songcraft."" I wouldn't contest the assertion that one of the reasons the Postal Service record still sounds great is that its form was novel but its content was classic. Here, I'm not sure. There's an insularity to Dntel's world that, in my mind, puts it slightly beyond criticism. If you go to his Tumblr, you'll see him holding up printouts of setlists from his online radio shows. I find this very endearing, and it mostly leads me to the idea that he's a guy who got semifamous almost by accident and would like nothing more than to just stay right where he is doing just what he wants to do.</p>
<p>Certain artists make long and fruitful careers out of repeating themselves. Electronic music is just starting to reach the point where nostalgia is a viable option. When reviewing the reissue of <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15950-dntel-life-is-full-of-possibilities"">Life is Full of Possibilities</a></i>, my colleague Matt LeMay said ""this was once the sound of the future."" Maybe there'll come a time when we can appreciate <i>Aimlessness</i> as the sound of the past. Until then, I defer as lovingly as I can to its title.</p></div>"|16695.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16695-aimlessness/|5.0|Mike Powell

He is part of an exciting new scene of mostly electronic musicians in Montreal; including Purity Ring and Grimes (with whom he released <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15439-darkbloom-ep/"" target=""_blank"">a split EP</a> last year). Like those two artists, d'Eon's approach has an esoteric bent to it, and on his new full-length, simply titled <i>LP</i>, he investigates two extremes of spirituality: He explores ideas of tradition and religion, pitting them against a modern self trapped at the top of a Facebook profile or communicating via iPhone.</p>
<p>For the most part, the questions <i>LP</i> poses are the ones you might ask yourself everyday when turning on your computer, but they also seem to be issues that haven't been explored that much in music. James Ferraro pushed some of the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuuMcnGXCmQ&amp;feature=results_video&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PLAD9E6F10D9668100"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">same buttons</a> on last year's <i>Far Side Virtual</i>, but Ferraro's approach felt a bit more ironic, or tongue-in-cheek. d'Eon's struggle with the online world and spiritual identity seems to come from a place of real soul-searching.</p>
<p>The near-10-minute closing track, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13596-al-qiyamah/"" target=""_blank"">""Al-Qiyamah""</a>, is a high point, and the most successful illustration of d'Eon's concept. He frames the track with a question right away: ""If we're stuck in here, what happens on Judgement Day?"" It's a dramatic sentiment but one equally applicable on a small scale, too: At what point does ""real life"" intersect with online life? The track is held together by some of the best production on the record: Swirling, iridescent synths keep pushing with forward motion before a breakbeat consumes the song at its halfway point. That beat eventually degrades, sounding almost like a chip tune by the time it rubs against a new age synth line at the end. Fittingly, it ends with the static of a phone signal interrupting a speaker frequency.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the density of <i>LP</i> does the record no favors-- it clocks in at a mighty one hour and 13 minutes-- and you almost wonder if there's some sort of meta point being made about saturation on the internet. Musically, <i>LP</i> isn't strong enough to sustain this weight, and the length makes what should be an interesting concept seem at times rambling and forced. Songs like ""Transparency Pt.

His primary band, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"" target=""_blank"">Portishead</a>, are notorious for taking <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portishead_discography#Studio_albums"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an average of seven years between albums</a> to acheive that perfect shade of noir. But each of the items in Barrow's bursting dossier of extracurricular assignments bears his meticulous touch. When he feels like making a hip-hop record, he assembles <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16464-quakers-st/"" target=""_blank"">one with 41 tracks and 30-plus guest MCs</a>. When he wants to sign a rock band to his Invada imprint, he goes for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13867-ugly-side-of-love/"" target=""_blank"">one built from a <i>Paul’s Boutique</i>-level of sample-based bricolage</a>. When he scores a production gig for an <i>NME</i>-endorsed group of garage-punk pin-ups, he refashions them as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12998-primary-colours/"" target=""_blank"">widescreen-visioned psychedelic goths</a>. And when he's in the mood to hear some Krautrock, rather than just dust off his well-worn copy of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16075-tago-mago-40th-anniversary-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tago Mago</i></a>, he makes a BEAK&gt; record.</p>
<p>Krautrock, of course, has become as much of a default mode for experimental indie bands as the blues was for a previous generation of classic-rockers. And in BEAK&gt;'s case, the sonic resemblances to their 70s forbears can be, well, unCanny: even more so than <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13602-beak/"" target=""_blank"">the band's self-titled 2009 debut</a>, <i>&gt;&gt;</i> sounds like it was recorded inside of Jaki Liebezeit's kick drum, all hypno-bass throb, heavy percussive grooves, and buzzing analog synths. Krautrock is synonymous with a certain rhythmic precision and propulsion, but BEAK&gt; don't just lock into a motorik beat and activate the cruise control. Rather, they see the music as part of a broader continuum, digging up its roots in the frazzled psychedelia of Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd, funk, and musique concrete, while emphasizing its influence on everything from electro and post-punk to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBhF__cBH8E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Italian horror-movie soundtracks</a> and stoner-metal.</p>
<p>As the lone keystroke difference between the first and second album titles suggest, this is a band that progresses in increments. <i>BEAK&gt;&gt;</i> retains the same eerie, claustrophobic atmosphere as its predecessor-- after all, its opening track is a sludgy, slow-motion swirl of police-siren effects called ""The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gaol</a>""-- and the ominously indecipherable vocals sound like they were recorded by <a href=""http://cdn3.pitchfork.com/news/46376/427c49d9.jpg"" target=""_blank"">the mouth-less dummies seen in their press shots</a>. But the new album also boasts a brisker pace-- spurred by the excitable synth-rock thrust of ""Yatton"" and ""Elevator"", and the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ7pYfELOeY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mushroom-heady</a> funk of ""Spinning Top""-- tauter arrangements, and a more purposeful sequence: All roads lead to side two's seven-minute colossus ""Wulfstan II"", an Earth-quaking jolt of brown-acid rock whose unrelenting, fuzz-bomb stomp is periodically interrupted by well-timed, organ-guided breakdowns, only to reemerge more nasty and unforgiving than before. (Though its Richter-scale reading is almost matched by the slow-creeping closer ""Kidney"", which begins as a Young Marble Giants murmur before erupting into a Slintian roar.) Barrow <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/portishead-to-start-work-on-new-album-in-january-20110920"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently quipped to <i>Rolling Stone</i></a> that it could be another ""fucking 10 years"" before we see a new Portishead record; whether he was joking or not, the wait will feel a little less interminable so long as this band continues to put their best &gt; forward.</p></div>"|16697.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16697-recordreview/|7.3|Stuart Berman

He's like my actual human dictionary when I'm in the studio rapping."" Black Hippy alpha Kendrick Lamar told Andrew Noz something similar in <a href=""http://www.thefader.com/2012/02/20/black-hippy-a-view-from-the-center/?single_paged=1"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">last February's issue of <i>The Fader</i></a>: ""When I first met [him] I thought he was a nerd. A nerdy, wizardish genius."" These two aren't slouches in the eloquence or intellect departments: To hear them speaking with hushed reverence about Ab-Soul was interesting, to say the least.</p>
<p>Now here's Ab-Soul, speaking for himself, on the opening track to his resounding new full-length <i>Control System</i>: ""Said I was the underdog/ Turned out I was the secret weapon."" The album opens with a quote from Janet Jackson (""This is a story about control/ My control""), and <i>Control System</i> similarly feels like a young artist discovering his voice. Ab-Soul is the only member of Black Hippy from the suburbs (Carson, Calif.) instead of the projects; he throws around terminology like ""paradigm shift"" in his lyrics. He is probably the member of Black Hippy who has spent the most time in a headlock. But <i>Control System</i> booms with self-possession and confidence. ""I used to wanna rap like Jay-Z, now I feel I can run laps around Jay-Z,"" he tells us matter-of-factly on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13575-illuminate-ft-kendrick-lamar/"" target=""_blank"">""ILLuminate""</a>, and I think of Lil Wayne explaining why he called himself ""Best Rapper Alive"" on <i>Dedication 2</i>: When you are busy mastering your craft, you should absolutely feel like you are the best at it in the universe. Ab's record is an exhilarating real-time document of that process.</p>
<p>All of the Black Hippy full-lengths are powerfully internal experiences: To spend time with Kendrick's <i>Section.80</i> or Schoolboy's <i>Habits &amp; Contradictions</i> is to walk around wearing that rapper's head on top of yours for a while. Wearing Ab's head proves to be a particularly intense experience: ""You should see the shit in my cerebrum,"" he tells us on ""Showin' Love"", comparing his synapses to ""lightning"" at another point. Being an ""actual human dictionary,"" Ab hasn't chosen these words lightly: His lyrics reel from wild-eyed conspiracy theorizing (at one point, Hitler's face appears in the burning Twin Towers) to egg-headed abstractions (Sumerians, Saturn, third eyes, Andromeda) to powerful, lucid observations. Ab sums it up neatly for us on ""Track Two"": ""Just imagine if Einstein got high and sipped juice/ Broke rules, got pussy, beat up rookies on Pro Tools,"" he offers. Oh, sure, one of those.</p>
<p>This cerebral/visceral friction is one of the most satisfying elements of Black Hippy, and Ab-Soul arguably carries it the furthest of the group. There is a song called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13517-sopa-ft-schoolboy-q/"" target=""_blank"">""SOPA""</a> on <i>Control System</i>, named for the Stop Online Piracy Act; Ab-Soul includes a pointed lyric about Trayvon Martin in his verse. But the beat, which shudders and lurches like a dying car, will make you scrunch your face and jerk your limbs like you are suffering neurological crisis. Schoolboy Q is on the song, too, and he would like you to know that he fucked your girl.</p>
<p>The song <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13419-terrorist-threats-ft-danny-brown-and-jhene-aiko/"" target=""_blank"">""Terrorist Threats""</a>, meanwhile, is prefaced by an incendiary quote from the documentary <i>Slavery By Consent</i> about imprisonment through debt. The beat sounds like the world’s loneliest single-person ping-pong game, being played in an abandoned car garage. ""If we could link up every gang/ And niggas is willin' to bear the pain/ We could put the White House lights out today,"" Ab-Soul barks, an echo of Dead Prez's ""run up on them crackers on the White House lawn"" call to arms. But what is that Jhene Aiko is coolly chanting in the background? A paraphrase on the ""spit yo flow"" hook from Jay-Z's ""Nigga What"".</p>
<p>Ab sees politics everywhere, even in the drink being mixed up in front of him (""Hennessy and coke, 1800/ We mixin' dark and light like the 1800s,"" he quips on ""Bohemian Grove"".) But politics are never all he sees. ""Genius idiot, best description of myself,"" he raps on ""Showin' Love"", and over the hour-plus course of <i>Control System</i>, he touches, lightly, on almost everything: heartbreak, cockiness, righteous anger. On ""The Book of Soul,"" he tells of being diagnosed with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, the origin of his unlikely nickname ""Black Lip Bastard."" On ""Beautiful Death,"" he assures us that while we die as individuals, we will rise as a nation. On the song here actually called ""Black Lip Bastard"", he accuses other rappers of ""eating yogurt in bed."" By the time it's over, he still sounds like he's only getting warmed up.</p></div>"|16784.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16784-control-system/|8.1|Jayson Greene

We were all trying to cross the internal divide between <a href=""http://deeplistening.org/site/content/about"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""the involuntary nature of hearing and the voluntary selective nature of listening,""</a> which seemed like it could mean a lot of different things. To me, it was about trying to experience sounds for what they were, not what they meant. The hum of a refrigerator and the whoosh of traffic gradually drifted away from their mundane contexts, revealing the variety and interconnection of what I was conditioned to hear as generic and separate. It was harder to detach the clock's tick from turning gears and passing time. In the moments when I could, I felt very free.</p>
<p>The occasion was a Deep Listening session with certified instructor <a href=""http://www.shannonmorrow.com/bio/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shannon Morrow</a>. Deep Listening is less of a thing you do than a way to do all kinds of things-- perform, meditate, communicate, compose, or just be in the world. It's hard to summarize but easy to grasp: a set of broadly accessible philosophies and practices for heightening your awareness of total sound. It's useful for anyone who wants to develop a musical practice or unlearn conventional sonic hierarchies.</p>
<p>It's also the core of the art of its creator, <a href=""http://www.paulineoliveros.us/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pauline Oliveros</a>, the 80-year-old composer, accordionist, teacher, and electronic music pioneer who easily ranks among the most innovative and influential musicians of the mid-20th-century avant-garde, which still strongly governs experimental music today. She wasn't the first to become entranced by the pops and whistles in the nether regions of the radio band. But she was one of the first to do something about it, focusing on frequencies instead of melodies, motions instead of rhythms, processes instead of outcomes.</p>
<p>Oliveros only formalized Deep Listening a couple of decades ago, but her curiosity to hear sound out to its very edges-- plus the ingenuity to pull it off-- has been apparent since she made her earliest works on a new frontier cluttered with magnetic tape, hulking computer rigs, tone oscillators, and primitive modular synthesizers. These are collected for the first time on <i><a href=""http://importantrecords.com/imprec/imprec352"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Reverberations: Tape and Electronic Music 1961-1970</a></i>, a monumental box set from Important Records.</p>
<p>One advantageous thing about tape music is that the performance is also the recording, so there was no shortage of material for this retrospective, which fills a dozen discs in almost as many hours. While any massive tape music collection will have its share of desultory windshear, the vision and variety of <i>Reverberations</i> are incredible, and feel surprisingly untarnished by 50 years of imitation. In the music, two distinct intelligences, one human and one mechanical, circle each other cautiously but inquisitively. We hear unpredictable occurrences, captured in the moment of discovery, becoming first principles for a new generation.</p>
<p>During the 1960s, in the musically thriving Bay Area, Oliveros counted the likes of Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and Loren Rush as her compatriots. She played accordion in the premiere of <i>In C</i>. She founded the San Francisco Tape Music Center with Morton Subotnick. She was in the thick of the pure electronic phase predating her seminal electro-acoustic work, using natural sounds and raw test signals as fodder for processing systems of her own design, which could be played almost like instruments.</p>
<p>This distinguished her from her contemporaries, most of whom were meticulous cutters and splicers. Her reel-to-reel delay system predicted Brian Eno's, but instead of dreamy melodies, she stuffed it full of splintering tones, working with magisterial patience through the kaleidoscope of possibilities in the particular control system. The music comes off as incidentally imagistic, but the answerless fact of sound is paramount. It's an elaborate magic show of competing frequencies, which apparently can do very weird things if you know what you're doing, as when a harmony swallows its own root notes so that we hear two absences ringing in tune.</p>
<p><i>Reverberations</i> feels contemporary, with its twitters and howls and eerie near-vocalizations; its hypnotic flux and explosive events. It should, as it lays substantial groundwork for every electronic drone artist and harsh noise terrorist to come-- anyone who relies on signals behaving semi-predictably to tap into an intuition beyond human capacity. On the spectrum of intensity, Oliveros runs from Keith Fullerton Whitman subtlety to John Wiese violence. This speaks to a certain posture of benevolent radicalism that has been as influential as her technical innovations.</p>
<p>A substantial booklet of essays accompanies this release, and a revealing moment comes in one by the artist <a href=""http://www.coryarcangel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cory Arcangel</a>, who studied music with Oliveros. He recalls her fondly describing a performance in the 60s where she tuned oscillators to the frequency of the hall, so the sound multiplied and sent people screaming. ""I want to send people screaming from institutions!"" Arcangel thought. The dawn of electronic music must have been an ideal time for that, when a second horizon appeared in music above the first one we'd chased for so long. It's harder to scandalize the academy now, but people are still trying.</p>
<p>I can't even claim to have heard every minute of <i>Reverberations</i>. I tried to play it in my house from morning to night one day, and it was, of course, overwhelming. I found it more interesting to listen to the same parts and notice how they changed each time. From a Deep Listening perspective, the music is completed by its total sonic environment, which is always different. Listening to the 30-minute-plus ""Angel Fix"" for the first time, it took a while to realize the birdsong entwined in the loopy high frequencies came from the screen door and not the speakers.</p>
<p>This porous boundary between music and world is immediately associated with John Cage, but Oliveros was right there with him, if not slightly out front; she was just behind Stockhausen in developing a common tongue for electronic music. She built technology we take for granted today, listened carefully to what it had to say, and then brought it back into a humanistic and acoustic process during what may be considered her prime career, from the 70s onward. But that would be a discredit to the groundbreaking work captured on <i>Reverberations</i>. Eerily listenable despite its daunting mien, it also has one of the rarest virtues: necessity. If it didn't exist, neither would music as we know it today.</p></div>"|16664.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16664-reverberations-tape-electronic-music-1961-1970/|9.0|Brian Howe

This is how a friend began an iChat conversation with me late last year and, short answer, ""no."" A longer answer would've been one that was likely shared by just about anyone keeping up with prevailing internet trends ca. November 2011: ""No, I haven't. But do I really need to actually <i>hear</i> Teen Daze to know exactly what it sounds like?” The answer to that question was likely ""no"" as well, since if you go to the young British Columbian's watercolor-splashed Bandcamp page, you could find EPs with titles such as <i>My Bedroom Floor, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14531-four-more-years-ep/"" target=""_blank"">Four More Years </a></i>and, I shit you not, <i>Beach Dreams</i>. His description of <i>Four More Years </i>includes the following phrases: ""chillwave,"" ""glo-fi,"" ""falling asleep on the beach,"" ""reverb-drenched,"" ""summer vibes."" Fast forward to Teen Daze's debut LP, <i>All of Us, Together</i>, arriving<i> </i>on the same label that brought you <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13510-psychic-chasms/"" target=""_blank""><i>Psychic Chasms </i></a>and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15873-the-year-of-hibernation/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Year of Hibernation</i></a>, and it's clear that his fervor has not waned: Note songs with titles like ""Brooklyn Sunburn"", ""The New Balearic"", and ""Cold Sand"". It's like Fraser Valley's cable providers allowed Teen Daze's Jamison to view the past three years of internet discourse with a snark-eliminating firewall.</p>
<p>Add it all up, and although Teen Daze is clearly the kind of guy who might say Memory Cassette changed his life with a straight face, his sincerity could disarm a nuclear warhead.  Can you really accuse someone of opportunism when he's knowingly dressed to the nines for a party that ended at least a year ago? Look, I remember hearing this stuff start to bubble up and thinking, ""<i>finally…</i>someone's doing <i>that</i>,"" and there have been plenty of great records to come from this subgenre. And can you knock a dude who for all intents and purposes comes off like chillwave's answer to the Darkness? You simply can't have <i>that </i>much enthusiasm about a specific artistic aesthetic and be cynical at the same time.</p>
<p>Though Jamison is intent on claiming to be a dance producer, it's actually helpful to view <i>All of Us, Together </i>within the frame of rock music. Typically, when electronic artists are likened to rock bands, it's something like Justice or Skrillex, acts that incorporate the hard, fast, and loud corndogging aspects of guitar music. But Jamison's compositional method is more along the lines of Real Estate, forthrightly melodic, unfussy, and wholly uncomplicated. These are basslines that could easily be tapped by a beginner familiarizing himself with root-note patterns. The steady 4/4 beats inch close to disco, and it doesn't sound like he went too far into his presets to select the drum sounds. The arpeggios could likely be slowed down to half speed and unpacked as open chords and ringing Strat leads. He even prefers flange and phaser effects above all else.</p>
<p>Jamison's intent is that <i>All of Us, Together </i>will inspire real life enactment of its title, but music that packs dance floors has an emotional or sonic ambition that alludes to social interaction inherently being a risky thing-- the music of Teen Daze is not, and it's hardly a total slight to say this is music meant for more meditative pursuits. It's too agile, perky, and sober to <i>really </i>be likened to chillwave and whether it's rangier numbers like six-minute opener ""Treten"" or more condensed near-pop like ""The Future"", everything amicably ambles along in the most agreeable way possible-- I've found it to be a good companion while walking to pick up a specific item or two at Trader Joe's, knowing exactly what I'm getting and knowing that the price never changes.</p>
<p>Which ultimately brings us back to where we started: odds are, you absolutely know what to expect from <i>All of Us, Together </i>and frankly, the actual quality of the record is less of a factor than your interest in what it brings to the table. But towards the end of <i>All of Us, Together, </i>you get the impression that Jamison's still learning on the job and might want to consider a name change. At times, it sounds far less like his beloved Boys of Summer 2009 so much as a simplified homage to Kompakt's more populist acts, electronic's version of a neophyte performing solo acoustic versions of Zeppelin or Radiohead at a college bar. The reverb trailing off the rigid snare hits imply the patiently-building ""For Body and Kenzie"" and ""The Future"" were created in the image of Gui Boratto's ""Beautiful Life"" and ""Erbstück"" pretty much never happens if the Field doesn't. Granted, he doesn't sound like he has nearly enough finesse as a producer to pull any of that stuff off right now, but it does nonetheless give <i>All of Us, Together </i>a distinct personality outside of being a guileless late adapter with more gusto than technique: if you ever wanted to commemorate the sound of your little brother discovering <i>Pop Ambient </i>for the first time, here you go.</p></div>"|16631.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16631-teen-daze-all-of-us-together/|6.0|Ian Cohen

""Mad Men""<span style=""font-style: normal;"">'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-vN4H4KBpA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">most memorable moment</a> this season had Anglophiles everywhere humming along with the coquettish, yé-yé ditty <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vFOzG3GYqo&amp;feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Zou Bisou Bisou""</a>; Wes Anderson's forthcoming </span><i>Moonrise Kingdom</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> uses the music of Francoise Hardy to conjure the blissful aura of young love; and then there was that time last week when the tidal wave of search results that came when you typed ""Jane Birkin looking cool in a boatneck"" into Tumblr made your browser crash. Still, 28-year-old Parisian-born singer-songwriter <a href=""http://minatindle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mina Tindle</a> reminds us that the moss is always greener on the other side of the pond. As a teen, Tindle idolized Chan Marshall (she cites the first time she heard Cat Power's simmering cover of ""Satisfaction"" as a formative musical moment), spent some time living as an ex-pat in Brooklyn, and later found inspiration in the fluttering pop of Leslie Feist. More of a folksy sophisticate than ye-ye throwback, Tindle's sweetly languid cover of ""Be My Baby"" that made the internet rounds leading up to the release of her debut LP </span><i>Taranta</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> sounded like a piece of bubblegum dissolving in rosewater.</span></p>
<p>Tindle got the name <i>Taranta</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> from a sensual and frantic old Italian folk dance that celebrates mad women, specifically those whose madness was induced by a spider's bite. Apart from its lack of arachnid references, it's a relatively apt title, as Tindle sets out to animate her tracks' refined pop structures with the leaping, kinetic energy of movement and dance. It works to great effect on ""Too Loud"", a song about the fatigue of wanderlust that begins with the gentle but antsy plinks of a toy piano, like a music box in fast motion. ""Abroad or at home/ I feel lost,"" she sings, her vocals lilting and agile as the track's momentum gathers, ""But if he called my name, just took my name/ Then I would stop my travels."" The single <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjKqBarZVaY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""To Carry Many Small Things""</a> has a similar energy, but it trades with the breathlessness of ""Too Loud"" for an assertion of cool control; both songs have the feel of a pop-foxtrot, and on ""To Carry Many Small Things"" she takes the lead with flair. Still, chorus reveals a nagging desire to fall out of step and into the blissful chaos of love: ""If I fall/ Would you fall with me?""</span></p>
<p>Moody French folk-pop artist J.P. Nataf (whom Tindle cites as another of her musical idols) produced <i>Taranta</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">.</span><i> </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">His touch is fittingly light, making sure that the arrangements are detail-oriented and textured but never so much that they overwhelm Tindle's voice. Although Tindle's style is at its most distinct during the aforementioned buoyant, piano-driven songs, </span><i>Taranta</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> is heaviest on the acoustic folk ballads, which range from quietly affecting (""Echo"") to cloyingly cheery (""Lovely Day""). But other than the blithely sighing ""Pan"", none of this material demonstrates what sets Tindle apart from the artists she most closely resembles, namely Feist's down-tempo tracks or the recent work of Charlotte Gainsbourg.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The disappointment of <i>Taranta </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">is how Tindle's professed fascination with madness, spider bites, and the hellish melancholy of early Cat Power records doesn't quite manifest in her music; and however unfair it is to measure a new artist's debut by the benchmarks of one of her idols, </span><i>Taranta </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">is decidedly more </span><i>Jukebox </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">than </span><i>The Covers Record</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">.

Still, </span><i>Taranta</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">'s not completely without substance to back up its breezily cool style.

Their 2001 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4764-they-threw-us-all-in-a-trench-and-stuck-a-monument-on-top/"" target=""_blank""><i>They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top</i></a>, was a raging fire of herky-jerky <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_Gold_%28album%29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Solid Gold</i></a> antagonism that ended a locked groove which, on CD, ran longer than all of the record's songs combined. The lead single from 2006's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4767-drums-not-dead/"" target=""_blank"">Drum's Not Dead</a></i>, ""It Fit When I Was a Kid"",<i> </i>featured the unconflicted cover image of the trio's faces superimposed onto gay pornography. Liars have shifted around geographically over the years as well, from New York to New Jersey to Berlin, but since settling down in Los Angeles in 2009, they've made some of their most unsettling and misanthropic work thus far.</p>
<p>The band's latest curveball arrives early on their latest album, <i>WIXIW.</i> Its opening track, ""The Exact Colour of Doubt"", features Tangerine Dream-like synths giving way to soft pitter-patter percussion and a guitar line that shimmers with <i>just</i> the right amount of reverb. It's lovely, ethereal, and not remotely indicative of what follows.</p>
<p><i>WIXIW </i>is a return to Liars' more adventurous, experimental roots, a dark and abstract detour from the more straightforward one-two punch of 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10588-liars/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled effort</a> and 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13991-sisterworld/"" target=""_blank""><i>Sisterworld</i></a>. While the latter showcased comparatively traditional instrumentation, <i>WIXIW</i> is largely electronic and sample-based, with frontman Angus Andrew's vocals featuring as one of very few recognizably organic presences on the record. The trait this album shares most with its predecessor is an abundance of creeping tension, but there's little catharsis to be found here, just a steady level of overcast unease.</p>
<p>Liars have always excelled at creating self-contained atmospheres and the overall vibe on <i>WIXIW</i> is pure dread and uncertainty, no doubt a by-product of the album's genesis. Andrew mentioned in our <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45959-the-new-liars-album-gets-a-title-wixiw/"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> that the creative process was ""more difficult"" than in the past, a result of he and band member Aaron Hemphill's increasingly collaborative songwriting. The strengthened partnership between the two is apparent, to the point where Andrew appears to address Hemphill directly on the cosmic rumination ""His and Mine Sensations"": ""Tell me it's a lie, Aaron/ Tell me it's a lie.""</p>
<p>While making the album, Andrew also began a serious romantic relationship while a relationship of Hemphill's ended. <i>WIXIW</i> finds itself emotionally and lyrically somewhere in the middle, mixing bitter sentiments and pleas for protection and safety with the same embrace of duality that marked <i>Drum's Not Dead</i>. The new album's title is pronounced ""wish you,"" and the harrowing upward climb of its title track and centerpiece reflects the type of yearning that the pronunciation suggests: ""I wish you were here with me/ I can't no longer take it all/ Wish you would not come back to me.""</p>
<p><i>WIXIW</i> is a very human and fragile album-- moreso than any other Liars record-- and it's initially easy to overlook these traits because the sound is so cold, electronic, and distant. It's so clearly the result of a rock band attempting to create electronic music that comparisons to Radiohead circa <i>Kid A</i> and <i>Amnesiac</i> are somewhat unavoidable. (Andrew's decidedly Thom Yorke-ish vocal takes on ""His and Mine Sensations"" and ""III Valley Prodigies"" add some weight to that, too.) But where Radiohead drew from the then-contemporary glitch of Warp-stamped IDM, Liars look further back on <i>WIXIW</i>, evoking an earlier period of electronic music.</p>
<p>That nod to the distant past is represented in the choice to bring in Mute founder and producer Daniel Miller (Depeche Mode, Yazoo) as a co-producer along with the band themselves, as well as in Liars' own rudimentary, back-to-basics sampling techniques, where they recorded dripping wet rags and deflated balloons, among other things. (You can find videos documenting these sampling techniques at the band's website.) As a result, even <i>WIXIW</i>'s most inhuman moments retain a force of brute, blunt physicality. Take Liars' drums away and leave them with nothing but machines, and they still project an incantatory, campfire-seance vibe.</p>
<p>Appreciating <i>WIXIW</i>'s taken risks and the subsequent riches that follow is a lot easier of a task than deciding where it ranks on the best-to-least-best scale of Liars' records. I'm fairly certain it's not their <i>best</i>, but even as I type this, each spin brings out new details and textures that color the listening experience in a different way. What we end up with is another very good album from a band that consistently turns out good work while charting its own path. Fascinating turns of change have always been Liars' sole consistency, and in that respect, I hope they stay the same forever.</p></div>"|16681.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16681-wixiw/|7.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

He tightened their bluesy sound into something that resembled dancepunk, funneling frontwoman Beth Ditto's unequaled soulful wail into clipped bursts of angst and joy. Despite the mechanical boxed-in feel of that album, the band kept their personality intact, producing their most listenable effort even if it wasn't always terribly original. But <i>Music for Men </i>wasn't exactly the bid for American stardom the trio (and their label) might have hoped for, and fifth album <i>A Joyful Noise</i> seems to address that directly. Here the reins are given over to UK pop mastermind Xenomania, perhaps best known for helming Sugababes and Girls Aloud's clever post-millennial bubblegum.</p>
<p>At first glance, it seems like business as usual: Opener ""Melody Emergency"" has Ditto bleating over a Led Zeppelin lurch more muscly than anything on <i>Men</i>. But when we get to first single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13311-perfect-world/"" target=""_blank"">""Perfect World""</a>, something feels very different. In some ways a stadium-sized rework of their biggest hit to date in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mQVljB7JGw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Heavy Cross""</a>, it shows how Xenomania's approach veers away from Rubin's. Where the latter turned the band's taut funk into a claustrophobic machine, here the sound is spread wide open, and the admittedly sparse band loses its concentrated strength-- an issue that plagues the rest of <i>Joyful Noise</i>. Xenomania's overbearing synth accents provide a new level of tactile texture, but they just as often overcook the already bland songs, so that tracks like ""Into the Wild"" sound like cheap jingles drained of the band's essential idiosyncrasies. Too often, Ditto's voice attempts to reach smooth plastic-soul Adele heights, stretching out syllables unnaturally, where before we could revel in her voice cracking into anguished screams.</p>
<p>Xenomania's touch begins to feel invasive over the course of the album, sometimes working in the band's favour-- the irresistibly slick ""Move in the Right Direction""-- but more often drowning the group in detrimental cliches. ""Get Lost"" is an awful attempt at a <i>True Blue-</i>era Madonna pastiche, replete with a cringe-worthy chorus about ""dancing to the beat of a different drum."" Ditto's always been about pulling obvious bits of musical history and making them her own, but here she just feels completely out of ideas (see also her talk of ""victims of love"" on ""I Won't Play""). The same goes for the confused ""Get a Job"", which aims to be a spiky electroclash jam with ill-advised preachy lyrics about a ""rich girl"" who ""lives every day like a weekend."" Hard to swallow coming from someone who lives as a touring artist.</p>
<p>All complaints aside, much like <i>Music for Men</i>, <i>Joyful Noise</i> is an inherently enjoyable pop album at its core, endearing even for all its missteps and pandering. It features Ditto's best-ever performance on the tender ""Casualties of War"", recalling <i>Ray of Light</i>-era Madonna (an easy touchstone for Gossip despite all their subversive politics) in its siren-like clarity of tone and voice. Her abrasive and relentless shtick is replaced by a tender vulnerability that's more heart-rending than we're used to from Gossip. ""Casualties"" is where Xenomania's expert studio hand works best, keeping the song restrained to a bubbling-under simmer that would have seemed impossible in the bulging veins and rushing heartbeats of their earlier work. It's enough to give hope for Gossip's future direction and their still unrealized potential as ""pure"" pop stars, but it's the sole promising moment on an album that ranges from average to disappointing. In the end, <i>Joyful Noise</i> feels like a stopgap.</p></div>"|16777.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16777-a-joyful-noise/|5.9|Andrew Ryce

One of the guys who deserves such attention is <a href=""http://oddiseemusic.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oddisee</a>, a producer and rapper from Washington, D.C., known for an eclectic take on soulful boom-bap. Oddisee, real name Amir Mohammed el Khalifa, has been creating compelling work outside the label system for some time now. His best release so far was last year's <i>Rock Creek Park</i>, a mostly instrumental ode to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Creek_Park"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">District public space</a> that crackled with warmth and nostalgia and has stayed lodged in my rotation ever since it came out.</p>
<p>Next up for Oddisee is the full-length <i>People Hear What They See</i>, but prior to that he's given away this EP featuring reworked cuts by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7244-metronomy/"" target=""_blank"">Metronomy</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1692-marvin-gaye/"" target=""_blank"">Marvin Gaye</a>, and the reggae rapper <a href=""pitchfork.com/artists/2374-k-os/"" target=""_blank"">k-os</a>. They're remixes in the loose sense, but Oddisee treats them like duets, keeping the original vocals basically intact but redoing the arrangement and adding a verse or two. I like this approach because it feels more like he's building off the source material rather than chopping it up and repurposing it. In the case of ""Paralyzed"", which uses Bon Iver's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePatJIwB-sI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Re: Stacks""</a> as its blueprint, Oddisee swaps out the guitar for a shuffling piano-jazz beat. His rhymes play off the song's lovelorn theme, and its spirit is similar, but the character is totally different.</p>
<p>It seems like Oddisee's a producer first but throughout the EP his lyrics are solid, alternately conscious and self-conscious without getting too didactic. He's conversational and loose and hints at bigger themes in a casual, offhand way. ""Paralyzed""'s ""Been a lot of places, rumors of racists/ But I can't lie, they was nice to me"" is one of those good tip-of-the-iceberg lines. The EP's best cut, though, is the one where he lets the original singer do most of the talking. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfpzePp5y8s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ain't That Peculiar""</a>, an update of the 1965 Marvin Gaye track of the same name, expertly blends old and new. Stripping away everything but Gaye's somber croon, Oddisee substitutes a heavy beat clap and synths-- there's a great tension between the sounds, an <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12266-otis/"" target=""_blank"">""Otis""</a>-type feeling but cleaner and more reverential.</p>
<p>Not everything here is that good. The k-os rework ""Man I Use to Be"" is the limpest of the batch, and at just four songs one dud can do significant damage. <i>Odd Renditions</i> does accomplish a few key things, though. Certainly it's a cool teaser for Oddisee's upcoming LP,  but it also emphasizes his wide sonic range and healthy approach to genre. Also, between instrumental fare like <i>Rock Creek Park</i>, more straightforward hip-hop stuff, and these diverse remixes, he's starting to build a well-rounded and idiosyncratic discography. Further proof that this a guy who should definitely be on your radar.</p></div>"|16782.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16782-odd-renditions-vol-001-ep/|6.8|Joe Colly

Mel Gibson's <i>Braveheart</i> war paint was thrilling housewives across the country, that sax-swingin' silver fox Bill Clinton was in office, Alanis Morissette was choking down jagged little pills, and Pantera were touring on <i>Far Beyond Driven</i>. It was also the year <i>Die Healing</i>, the last <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/stvitus"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Saint Vitus</a> album, was released. A year later, the Los Angeles doom legends called it quits, and fans despaired of ever having the chance to add more of guitarist Dave Chandler's riffs to their record collections, let alone to witness the electricity of Vitus' live show. Now, 17 years later, they've returned.</p>
<p>Saint Vitus reunited in 2003 for a handful of explosive performances that got tongues wagging, but things stayed quiet for the new few years. The original lineup hit the road in 2008, but a year later, drummer Armando Acosta left after 31 years behind the kit, and then tragically passed away in 2010. This left the band without an anchor, but perhaps inspired by his memory, Saint Vitus gathered themselves up and returned with a vengeance, joined by new drummer Henry Vasquez (Sourvein, Blood of the Sun). Tours and festival appearances followed and the inevitability of a new album seemed to draw closer, until a partnership with Season of Mist finally brought it to life.</p>
<p>Of course,<i> Lillie: F-65</i> arrived weighed down by a hell of a lot of expectations. It was hard even for the faithful not to anticipate a letdown so long after the band's classic drug-fueled days, but from opening track <a href=""http://www.season-of-mist.com/common/downloads/SaintVitus/SAINT_VITUS_-_Let_Them_Fall.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Let Them Fall""</a> onward, the 33-minute collection feels like coming home. Our first taste was the single ""Blessed Night"", a pitch-perfect example of Sabbathian doom. On it, Chandler busts out a deceptively simple riff, torn straight out of the 1970s and dusted with dirt weed that gets mangled gloriously beneath iconic frontman Scott ""Wino"" Weinrich's deep, throaty snarl. Mark Adams' bass line haunts the background while Vasquez brings the drums to life, adding his own hard-hitting, fluid touches to the classic Vitus stomp. It wasn't a fluke: The boys are on fire here, flush with renewed energy and basking in the glow of their newfound power.</p>
<p>The collection's swaggering second track ""The Bleeding Ground"", with its bluesy, brawny Chandler solo and soon-to-be-classic riffs, fades into ""Vertigo"", a gently mournful, folk-tinged instrumental. ""Blessed Night"" then kicks off with a forbidding wash of feedback and one of<i> those</i> riffs, the ones that grab you and throw their arms around your shoulders and raise their fists, and suddenly you're headbanging harder than you have all night. While the following track, ""The Waste of Time"", is less memorable than the others, ""Blessed Night"" is one of the album's strongest, capitalizing on its creators' well-hewn sense of groove and melody then leaving it all washed out and sandblasted with layers of fuzz. Chandler's prowess as an axeman cannot be given enough emphasis: his writhing, twisted, screaming solos, and devilishly heavy riffs funnel blood and mercury into Saint Vitus' heart, as Wino's pipes lay down the soul.</p>
<p>Returning to the Vitus fold after 22 years, and various other projects, Wino's voice is coarse and weathered, roughened by decades of smoke and whiskey. He's lived hard, and lived fast, and those thirsty, miserable years have left their mark. Slinking through lyrics that veer between intergalactic fantasy and Ragnarok to very human expressions of frustration and agony, his warm, ragged growl commiserates and accuses in turn. A song like ""Dependence"" is a dusty, cracked window into a world that seems almost alien, or perhaps, all too familiar, describing as it does a morning in the life of an addict. There are no metaphors at play, no sugarcoating or borrowed experience. This is-- was--  his life, and that honesty shines through the distortion. As the song spirals downward, the riffs follow, howling in pain, collapsing into acceptance, and bleeding out during ""Withdrawal""'s three-and-a-half-minute feedback funeral. It's a very Vitus way to end a record, and makes it clear as crystal that after all this time, they still know how to leave us wanting more.</p></div>"|16767.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16767-lillie-f-65/|8.0|Kim Kelly

Ford is best known as one half of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29470-ford-lopatin/"">Ford &amp; Lopatin</a>, a duo who managed to find an awkward kind of parity in bulbous funk tracks, 1980s cheese-rock, retro-futurist pop, and the methadone gleam of new age. His work additionally extends to a part as bassist in Brooklyn soft-rock outfit Tigercity, and to his solo project Airbird. The latter gained notice for the <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/mexicansummer/city-vs-mountains"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""City vs Mountains""</a> single in 2011, the title of which acted as a literalist representation of Ford's residential rotation between New York City and North Carolina. It was his most overt pop move since the excellent 2010 single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/41004-video-games-strawberry-skies-ft-laurel-halo/"">""Strawberry Skies""</a>, released under the proto-Ford &amp; Lopatin moniker <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28693-games/"">Games</a>. But <i>Trust</i> edges away from repetition, dipping out of outright pop and looping back around to encompass all the other influences winding through his brain. </p>
<p>What's impressive with this release, as with most things Ford touches, is his hypercritical attention to detail. It's full of fussy little touches that don't necessarily become apparent until you're six or seven plays in. It separates Ford from the dwindling underground of 80s acolytes who are happy to lean hard on the slap-bass preset on their Yamaha keyboard and let the guffaws roll right in. <i>Trust</i> finds inspiration from those sounds and takes them to a tender place, providing the much-needed comedown from the souped-up Prince-isms of tracks like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12225-too-much-midi-please-forgive-me/"">""Too Much MIDI (Please Forgive Me)""</a> from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15502-channel-pressure/""><i>Channel Pressure</i></a>. Sometimes it's a little too easy to play spot-the-influence with Ford's various projects, and Airbird is no different. On the surface this EP could easily be dismissed as a series of pointless genre-hopping exercises, but most of the material here falls into a logical cohesion, representing a leap toward the future instead of a simple grab bag of sounds from the past.</p>
<p>The decade that Ford just can't let go is still fully represented, although often in unexpected ways. ""Royal"" is built around the kind of skeletal electro framework <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2670-mantronix/"">Kurtis Mantronik</a> was busy assembling circa 1985-86, full of echoing handclaps and sparsely blinking synth lines. By the time this five-track EP gets to its penultimate track, the brooding ""Goodnight"", Ford is channeling the desolate work of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/24959-the-blue-nile/"">the Blue Nile</a> circa <i>A Walk Across the Rooftops</i>. He never reaches the same highs and intentional lows of either Mantronix or the Blue Nile, but it highlights an upswing in ambition, a sense that Ford isn't content to be simply remembered for playing a part in the indie underground's sudden disposition for old Harold Faltermeyer singles at the start of this decade.</p>
<p>That widening of the scope of what Ford could achieve with his music also surfaces in Jeff Gitelman's soaring David McAlmont-style vocal wails on the glistening, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29695-thundercat/"">Thundercat</a>-like title track, and it's there again in the soft Rhodes-y piano stabs that bed down the eerie new age-isms of ""Deep Dreams, Inc"". The latter resembles a placid take on the kind of world that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29925-kuedo/"">Kuedo</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15945-severant/""><i>Severant</i></a> inhabited in 2011, with both records feeling like lost sci-fi soundtracks looking for appropriate visual counterparts. It's a picture partially completed by the cover art of <i>Trust</i>, which resembles a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3306-photek/"">Photek</a> release circa <i>Modus Operandi</i>, or something belonging to Graham Sutton's experimental drum and bass outfit <a href=""http://www.last.fm/music/Boymerang"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Boymerang</a>. Both Photek and Sutton purposefully hurtle headlong into the future with their music, and while <i>Trust</i> often feels firmly anchored to the past, there's enough here to suggest that Ford is doing some future gazing of his own.</p></div>"|16687.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16687-trust-ep/|6.1|Nick Neyland

But when it comes to covering other people's songs, he's an unabashed populist. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TskWjFZsS3o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Blowin' in the Wind""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVAS8mYDB_E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""All Along the Watchtower""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E2xVc7Znf4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""A Day in the Life""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cQo3l2AhcA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HF3QY_qvtoU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""On Broadway""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FK7JbQOuUBo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Four Strong Winds""</a>-- Young is obviously not the sort of artist who selects covers to reveal something new about himself, or to prove how cool his record collection is. Instead, true to his utilitarian ethos, he's more interested in transforming the mythical into the practical, reclaiming once-vital songs that have essentially been overplayed into Muzak and investing them with a new sense of purpose. In Young's hands, the most totemic songs in pop history become more flawed and, as a result, more down to Earth.</p>
<p>For this latest studio album-- the first with Crazy Horse in nine years-- Young applies that logic across an entire record. <i>Americana</i> joins Paul McCartney's <i>Kisses on the Bottom</i> and Iggy Pop's <i>Après</i> in this year's aging-rocker covers-album sweepstakes, though it's less about digging into personal favorites as reclaiming some of the most popular songs ever written. And we're not talking about mere golden oldies here, but ancient public-domain standards that predate the existence of pop radio and the music industry entirely: ""Clementine"", ""She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain"", ""Oh Susannah"", and the like. These aren't songs anyone really listens to anymore, because we don't need to. They're practically part of our collective DNA: songs that you whistle while you work or use to sing your baby to sleep or to entertain impatient kids sitting around a campfire. Invariably, they're also songs whose simple, sing-along melodies obscure the real-life maladies-- poverty, unemployment, lost love, murder, crises of faith-- that originally inspired them over a century ago. As such, <i>Americana</i> isn't so much a covers collection as a concept album in the vein of Nick Cave's <i>Murder Ballads</i>: new variations on age-old themes that still resonate loud and clear today.</p>
<p>Alas, it's also the sort of album where you pretty much know what it's going to sound like just by reading the record's spine and tracklist. What you see is what you you get: old-timey tunes subjected to Crazy Horse's desecrating grungy grind. And given the over-familiarity and brevity of the source material, it's a novelty that wears itself out quickly. While Young and the Horse effectively tease out the unpleasant undercurrents in songs like ""Oh Susanna"", ""Wayfaring Stranger"", and ""Clementine"" (which reinstates the oft-omitted line about macking on the deceased title subject's sister), <i>Americana</i> doesn't so much amount to a caustic commentary on the modern-day American condition as capture a bunch of old pals trying to rediscover their chemistry by sloppily jamming on some standards-- and in some cases, like the repetitious eight-minute trudge through true-crime tale ""Tom Dula"", driving them into the ground. Compared to his <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQccK0F1_iY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">previous</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82CYNj7noic"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">state-of-the-nation</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVRxdPWV3RM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">addresses</a>, Young doesn't so much attack the material as playfully mess around with it; nearly every track here concludes with some cheerful studio chatter that suggests what we just heard was the Horse's first-ever pass at the song. This slackness defines <i>Americana</i> more so than its political intent; as the tracklist moves forward to relatively more recent fare like Woody Guthrie's ""This Land Is Your Land"" and the Silhouttes' late-1950s standard ""Get a Job"", you might as well be listening to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a6A6oTFdcw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Shocking Pinks</a>.</p>
<p>But just as the aforementioned <i>Murder Ballads</i> capped off its orgy of carnage with a surprisingly redemptive cover of Bob Dylan's ""Death Is Not the End"", <i>Americana</i> boasts a similarly high-concept denouement: Only Young would deign to close out a tribute to the American folkoric tradition with a cover of the British national anthem. Whether it's a backhanded salute to the country that incited the American Revolution in the first place, or simply a sly nod to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Young#Early_years_.281945.E2.80.931966.29"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his own roots in the Commonwealth</a>, Young's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-nPsrX05Rk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""God Save the Queen""</a>-- with its drunken drummber-boy beat, squealing electric-guitar fanfare, and cheeky choral vocal--proves to be just as blasphemous to Britain's most sacred song as <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtUH2YSFlVU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the namesake number by his one-time muse Johnny Rotten</a>. It ain't exactly <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMhq1L0cJf0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hendrix doing ""The Star-Spangled Banner""</a>, but then that's precisely the point: It's Young's way of saying that-- even when you're dealing with another country's intellectual property-- this song is your song, this song is my song.</p></div>"|16684.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16684-americana/|6.1|Stuart Berman

<p>In terms of paring back, though, the deluge is executed with minimum musical verbosity: Sun Kil Moon's last album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14430-admiral-fell-promises/"" target=""_blank""><i>Admiral Fell Promises</i></a>, featured just Kozelek playing nylon-stringed guitar in a Spanish-influenced fingerpicked style, and it's much the same here, save for a handful of songs where he's backed by a small ensemble-- banjo, violin, light drums. The Spanish flourishes are condensed to an occasional trill and the odd bout of dramatic inflection (the tremulous waltz of ""The Winery""), with Kozelek embracing the genre by being less the flamboyant and romantic artist presenting small and considered masterpieces; more an observer content to sit back on warm, dusty street corners, casually chronicling what he sees (or imagines) and throwing in oblique personal reflections from his 20-plus years as a songwriter.</p>
<p>In Stephen Deusner's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14430-admiral-fell-promises/"" target=""_blank"">review</a> of <i>Admiral Fell Promises</i>, he wrote that the split between Sun Kil Moon and Mark Kozelek is ""a way to document the complex lives of his songs, which are never quite finished but always hold the potential for rebirth and transformation."" At their sparsest and least lyrical, the songs here are all finished in a sense, even when Kozelek openly sings about how he thinks certain efforts could be better (""It's a chore to write half a dozen/ Some guys lay back and rest on their laurels like lazy old hacks/ Well I wrote this one and I know it ain't great,"" he admits on ""Track Number 8""). However, the casualness and immediacy of his recollections (a homeless girl outside his door, watching cats in the street), and the repetitive nature of much of the playing, indicates that he hasn't worked much of the material up a great deal. ""King Fish"" is the only song here performed on electric guitar, swaying pendulum-like with a dour heft that recalls the absorbing, weighty tone of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9958-ghosts-of-the-great-highway/"" target=""_blank""><i>Ghosts of the Great Highway</i></a>, yet its relatively basic way with transition and lack of development over its near-seven-minute duration (there's a little closed-eye, loping-head guitar jam toward the end, that's about it) again makes it seem fairly unadulterated. </p>
<p>This lack of formality and sense of true ""finishedness"" may well feel frustrating, whether you preferred the bittersweet fullness of <i>Ghosts</i> or the compact, elegant sculptures of <i>Admiral Fell Promises</i>, perhaps the two furthest removed cornerstones of Sun Kil Moon's releases to date. Certainly, some of the songs here, particularly towards the end-- the record clocks in at 73 minutes-- feel a little lazy or unnecessary. Kozelek's main way of increasing the drama or tension of a wiry, rankled song like ""That Bird Has a Broken Wing"" is to raise and layer his voice, a trope that gets a bit tired after a while. There are plenty of moments of graceful, serene beauty, however, that pull their weight as part of such a large body. The dry stroke of ""Young Love"" feels forlornly romantic; the title track could easily be the theme to a cerebral family drama, such is its quintessentially warm, accepting tone (and sweetly syrupy violin); the song with the ridiculously long title bows and sparkles like birds hopping on a telephone wire in the wind.</p>
<p>Deusner posed a question in his review of <i>Admiral Fell Promises</i>: ""What makes a Mark Kozelek solo album different from a Sun Kil Moon album?"" While the mostly solo <i>Among the Leaves</i> really serves only to muddy any answer to that question, it poses another: What's Kozelek gunning for on this record? It's uncompromisingly long, but often courtly and sweet, the kind of familiar furniture that feels as though it could easily soundtrack a beautiful moment. He's rancorous about touring and how much he hates London (""UK Blues""), and magnanimous whether singing about the woman he loves (""Track Number 8""), women he's cheated on (""That Bird Has a Broken Wing""), women who have stalked him around the world (""I Know It's Pathetic""), or died and broken his heart (he names the subject of ""Katy Song"" on ""UK Blues"", and her presence hovers elsewhere).</p>
<p>The lyrics are uncharacteristically jokey in parts: the ""guys in tennis shoes"" who replaced the hot girls who once made up Red House Painters' audiences on standout song ""Sunshine in Chicago""; citing a crowd member in Ireland who moaned that he hadn't had such a bad time at the show since seeing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"" target=""_blank"">Bill Callahan</a> (""UK Blues 2""). There's little poetry or affect to the words, which are concerned with fairly straight storytelling about Kozelek's personal and impersonal relationships rather than anything particularly <i>lyrical</i>. Overall, you get the impression he isn't really trying that hard, that bettering his bests isn't a notion that interests him, 20 years after the release of Red House Painters' debut album. He's the kind of talented songwriter that can mostly pull that off; though for a record so spare and simple, <i>Among the Leaves</i> comes off as strangely confrontational.</p></div>"|16674.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16674-among-the-leaves/|6.8|Laura Snapes

The Glasgow band can claim the unique distinction of recording for two of the preeminent British indie labels of the late 20th century, Factory and Sarah. Fittingly, their best music mixes nervously funky post-punk with wispy bedroom synth-pop. But of course, that combination was hardly obvious at the time, and it's easy to see how in an earlier media environment, the Wake must've sounded like lesser clones of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"" target=""_blank"">New Order</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/873-the-cure/"" target=""_blank"">the Cure</a>.</p>
<p>The Wake will still probably always remain a cult band compared to those groups, but they've proven increasingly influential over the past few years. Stateside indie poppers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28199-the-drums/"" target=""_blank"">the Drums</a> have said they came together with ""the idea of completely ripping the Wake off."" Recently defunct Swedish duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/12663-air-france/"" target=""_blank"">Air France</a> borrowed from the Wake for a song on their 2006 <i>On Trade Winds</i> EP. But leading the Wake revival has been Brooklyn label Captured Tracks, which reissued two of the band's singles for Record Store Day 2011 and has commissioned a handful of cover versions by its roster, whose members generally share the Wake's dreamy melancholy and independent mindset. </p>
<p>Captured Tracks has now lovingly reissued the Wake's 1985 sophomore album-- by some measure their best-- and the non-album tracks from the same era, which are even better. Singer-guitarist Gerard ""Caesar"" McInulty, who had previously been a member of pre-fame Altered Images, formed the Wake in 1981 with singer-keyboardist Carolyn Allen, drummer Steven Allen, and bassist Joe Donnelly, soon to be replaced by Bobby Gillespie, who would go on to greater fame with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"" target=""_blank"">the Jesus and Mary Chain</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3394-primal-scream/"" target=""_blank"">Primal Scream</a>. But 1982 debut album <i>Harmony</i> hewed a bit too clumsily to the Factory line. Gillespie had moved on by the time of all but one of the tracks here, replaced by Alex MacPherson.</p>
<p><i>Here Comes Everybody</i> holds up as a touchstone for aching, atmospheric synth-pop, all slinky guitars, crisp percussion, textured keyboard, and limber bass. ""This is a page from my diary,"" Caesar begins on ""O Pamela"", which has since been covered by Nouvelle Vague; with a guitar-and-synth intro that uncannily predicts Tears for Fears' far glossier (and more commercially successful) 1985 hit ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"", it could be the diary of more recent artists from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28094-washed-out/"" target=""_blank"">Washed Out</a> to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29667-youth-lagoon/"" target=""_blank"">Youth Lagoon</a>, too. Nor is the album afraid of taking something schmaltzy-- like the embarrassing Don McLean quote on seven-minute ""Melancholy Man"", or the jaunty harmonica on heartbroken ""World of Her Own""-- and investing it with fragile sincerity. Expansively wispy, this is a record best heard as a whole, a missing evolutionary link between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5044-josef-k/"" target=""_blank"">Josef K</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1640-the-field-mice/"" target=""_blank"">the Field Mice</a>.</p>
<p>The most immediate examples of the Wake's legacy, however, and the tracks you'll most likely play for your friends, come on disc two, which collects the group's 7"" and 12"" releases from 1983 to 1987. The ambiguous 1984 single ""Talk About the Past"", with its twitchy guitar and splashes of piano by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1171-the-durutti-column/"" target=""_blank"">the Durutti Column</a>'s Vini Reilly, and 1985's loping contemplation ""Of the Matter"", with its elegaic vividness (""There's a shadow of a shadow moving in""), are both wonderful. But then so is the entirety of 1987's <i>Something That No One Else Could Bring</i> EP, which includes the luminously catchy ""Gruesome Castle"", with its proto-chillwave hook: ""Arise, arise, and keep up appearances."" The only relative duds are the murkily sprawled 1983 B-side ""Host"", with Gillespie, and the dubby finale ""Of the Matter (Version)"", which at the very least lets the record end with the original song's epigrammatic closing words: ""And when you find me, you will find me alone/ Then we'll walk to your house, walk together, walk home.""</p>
<p><i>Here Comes Everybody</i> and its singles have been reissued before, in 2002 by LTM, but this is their first U.S. release, and their first vinyl pressing since the original Factory records. First available on Record Store Day alongside reissues of albums by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16553-blow-away-your-troubles-on-any-normal-monday-midnight-cleaners/"" target=""_blank"">Cleaners From Venus</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16507-shot-forth-self-living-the-buried-life/"" target=""_blank"">Medicine</a>, the box set I purchased online is simply but carefully packaged, with a 12""x12"" booklet of historically significant liner notes by Caesar, lyrics, and photography, plus full sleeves for both records and a 7"" featuring Portland-based Captured Tracks band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13411-pale-spectre-the-wake-cover/"" target=""_blank"">Blouse's spaced-out cover</a> of the <i>Something</i> EP's ""Pale Spectre"". On the flip is labelmates <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29172-craft-spells/"" target=""_blank"">Craft Spells</a>' complementary ""Talk About the Past"".</p>
<p>That last song, one almost explicitly referred to on the title track of Air France's Sincerely Yours labelmate <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10958-here-comes-the-future/"" target=""_blank"">the Honeydrips' 2007 <i>Here Comes the Future</i></a>, sounds especially relevant at a time when being internet-famous is no longer a novelty: ""Have you heard the good news/ Everybody is a star/ Have you heard the good news/ Everybody works so hard."" It's perhaps no coincidence that the title of <i>Here Comes Everybody</i>, a <i>Finnegans Wake</i> reference that confirmed the Wake's relationship to the James Joyce novel, was also the title of New York University professor Clay Shirky's 2008 book on crowdsourcing and ""mass amateurization.""</p>
<p>It might not be a surprise, either, that Caesar and Carolyn Allen, after teaming up with the Field Mice and Trembling Blue Stars' Bobby Wratten as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6613-the-occasional-keepers/"" target=""_blank"">the Occasional Keepers</a>, have selected 2012 to reunite for a new album by the Wake, <i>A Light Far Out</i>, which came out in early May on LTM. They might not ever be truly stars, but the time they've worked so hard for is, well, now.</p></div>"|16661.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16661-here-comes-everybody/|8.2|Marc Hogan

Its first single was a strip club song called <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKGQ5cIw_ew"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Like a Pimp""</a>, and the single that followed it spoke directly to God about reconciling the desire to live ""right"" with wanting to also live like a rapper. On one song he would spit taunts about having fucked someone else's girl, and on another he would pointedly take George W. Bush to task for his record of executions as governor of Texas. Banner didn't necessarily come to many conclusions, but that was the beauty of his work: He was as confused and indignant and answerless about himself and his community as anyone, and as everyone has the right to be.</p>
<p>Even in a Southern rap landscape that was more diverse than many people gave it credit for at the time, Banner was a rare bird. Now, he's something much more common: a rapper trying to recapture a spotlight that has long been shut off, and probably isn't coming back on. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5605-killer-mike/"" target=""_blank"">Killer Mike</a>, who is about as similar an MC to Banner as there is, has shown this year that it's not impossible to make a great rap album that people care about, even if that audience is a fraction of what it once was. But with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16537-killer-mike-rap-music/"" target=""_blank""><i>R.A.P. Music</i></a>, Killer Mike more or less rejected the entire notion of regaining the fanbase he once had by making the music he once did. Banner, on the other hand, uses <i>Sex, Drugs &amp; Video Games</i>,<i> </i>available as a <a href=""http://www.datpiff.com/David-Banner-Sex-Drugs-Video-Games-mixtape.349642.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">free download</a>, to cling to past glory, and the result is an album where the contradictions come off as cynical instead of honest. This isn't exactly a surprise, as Banner has with each successive album moved further away from the likable, inspiring man behind <i>Mississippi</i><i> </i>in favor of chasing whatever trend is hot at the time. But it is still disappointing, as it wouldn't be unreasonable to hope that he would reverse course as mini-stardom gets smaller and smaller in his rearview.</p>
<p>Where he used to be as hard on himself as he was on his peers, Banner now gives himself a pass when convenient. To wit: On ""Swag"" he chastises rap's obsession with that same omnipresent word. In the song, he directly mentions white girls calling rappers the n-word, which is of course a perfectly acceptable and necessary topic of discussion. Except ""Swag"" comes two songs after he calls in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30007-asap-rocky/"" target=""_blank"">A$AP Rocky</a>-- whose breakout song is called ""Purple Swag"", the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1650-aap-rocky-purple-swag/"" target=""_blank"">video for which</a> features a white girl mouthing the n-word-- for a verse. Banner also says that when he dies, he doesn't want to be remembered just for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qld7WvHa5kc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Play""</a>, his absurdly raunchy rip-off of ""Wait (The Whisper Song)"". Fair enough, but hoping that people will remember more than just his most crassly commercial hit stands in stark contrast to the two songs here that feature Chris Brown, who starred on Banner's last Billboard hit in 2008. Those two songs (""Yao Ming"" and ""Amazing""), with their noxious mixture of trends old (hashtag punchlines) and new (Chris Brown) are so hopelessly formulaic that they're nadirs as much in theory as in execution.</p>
<p>There are times where he tries to callback to the days of <i>Mississippi</i>, specifically with three interludes where he addresses himself through the voice of a female robot. He asks himself questions that are legitimate, but the placements are so bizarre that the interludes seem like they're from an entirely different album, if not an entirely different artist. On the first, the robot asks him why, if he would object to his mom or sister being called a bitch, he also uses the term. Fine enough question, if a bit entry-level, but not only does he not ever provide an answer, he sandwiches the interlude between the two songs where Chris Brown raps about pubes. Another asks him what song of his he would choose to perform in front of God, and that one is for some reason followed by a track where he trades tired bars about California with an epically bored-sounding Snoop Dogg (and Snoop will show up for <i>anything </i>and seem happy).</p>
<p>Banner still has some of what made him compelling nearly a decade ago, but when those qualities pop up on <i>Sex, Drugs &amp; Video Games</i>, they work only to illustrate how unmoving his music is today. It doesn't have to be this way, of course, as Killer Mike has shown, but until Banner drops the pretense of pop, his output will likely continue to be utterly unrewarding and sadly inessential.</p></div>"|16778.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16778-sex-drugs-video-games/|4.9|Jordan Sargent

The drums plod with indefatigable power, so that every tom hit feels like thunder from above and each cymbal crash shatters down like the pieces of a broken chandelier. The repetitive guitar riffs circle and hang, too, cresting through clouds of distortion before disappearing again within the din. The bass sits in the middle of it all, unremarkable but necessary, saturating the space within these 20-minute sprawls with a hum that's felt as much as it is heard. Aldebaran's vocalists-- guitarist Todd T. and drummer Tim T.-- growl low and slow, roaring words about the failure of flesh and the battle for the heavens at a nearly indecipherable clip. At just less than 67 minutes, and with its glacial changes and shifts of momentum, <i>Embracing</i> demands all of the niche's customary resilience and attention, if not more.</p>
<p>Thing is, Aldebaran also reward it. Possibly the most essential record of its kind since Maine's Ocean made <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12648-pantheon-of-the-lesser/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pantheon of the Lesser</i></a>, <i>Embracing the Lightless Depths</i> overcomes its stylistic circumscription by actually letting some light <i>in</i> and sucking it right back <i>out</i>. Though recorded largely in one continuous take by veteran Billy Anderson, the span comes subdivided into five tracks. The two nearly half-hour, full-band pieces, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13553-forever-in-the-dream-of-death/"" target=""_blank"">""Forever in the Dream of Death""</a> and ""Sentinel of a Sunless Abyss"", are surrounded by three comparatively brief instrumentals that twinkle and build, murmur and slink, and-- at album's end-- drone and fade away. These something-like-pretty interludes offer respite from the monsters in the middle. But that same idea comes engrained in those big pieces, too. The start of ""Forever in the Dream of Death"", for instance, suggests the post-rock/instro-metal nexus of Pelican and Monos' time together on tour, or even a mix between Temporary Residence labelmates Envy and Explosions in the Sky. When all four pieces hurtle in unison toward the coda after a quiet spell some 16 minutes in, Aldebaran even sound triumphant, with drums racing for some prize and guitars arching together skyward. ""Sentinel of a Sunless Abyss"" turns the same trick, interrupting the general brood with a gorgeous calm toward the middle and building the rhythm to a fist-pumping quake near the end.</p>
<p>But just as soon as Aldebaran let you into these moments of incandescence or relaxation, they take them back without apology. Whether with darker and more daunting vocals or a crushing return to low-tempo form, Aldebaran always retreat into a void of hope, a Plato's cave of despair and desolation. Aldebaran are by no means the heaviest band in doom, not even close; but they make every ounce of their weight count by knowing exactly how to counter it. Disappointment, they posit, exists only because of expectation and hope. This strategy never comes across as ham-fisted or simple-minded; it simply affords Aldebaran a depth and complexity that so much of doom sometimes forgoes. </p>
<p>There's a tendency to dismiss heavy metal bands making literary allusions and references that approach academia as dilettantes, simpletons painting the surface with superficial, Wiki-like knowledge. This is the realm, after all, of long hair and big beards, bong hits and beer cans. But digging behind Aldebaran's irascible vocals is almost as rewarding as the record itself. Building on a continuum of American horror writing that spans from Ambrose Bierce, H.P. Lovecraft, and Robert Chambers to their legion acolytes, Aldebaran borrows a cast of characters and places from that canon (Hastur, Hali, Carcosa, and so on) and writes beautifully around them. Just as the music here sometimes uses elegance to underline the malevolence, the strength of some of these phrases and fragments-- ""behind a pallid mask, cloaked in robes of broken bones,"" or ""Hail! The absorber of light, forever in the dream of death""-- give this mean record a smart core. Really, that's just another symptom of Aldebaran's central function: crafting complex, multivalent heavy metal that keeps giving (and, as it were, taking) with repeated listens.</p></div>"|16704.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16704-embracing-the-lightless-depths/|8.0|Grayson Currin

Translated from the jargon, this means you peek over Max's shoulder as he hides behind stationary things and shoots at moving ones. He can also slow down time, turning frantic gunplay into underwater choreography in the manner of countless action films. The L.A. noise-rock band <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5523-health/"">HEALTH</a>'s original score distinctively replicates this torpid frenzy, mostly by setting slow, languid themes against fast, urgent drums. In between, a moment of suspense is trapped and prolonged, and the feeling that something momentous is about to happen seldom flags. It's a generous and commanding piece of work, slightly checked by the homogenizing pressures of its format.</p>
<p><i>Max Payne 3</i> is organized around linear, contained events. This permitted HEALTH to create full-fledged compositions, from drafty FX hymns to throbbing anthems, instead of trying to rig up an album from bits of modular music-- a challenge faced by Amon Tobin with valor but mixed success on his fifth album, the score for <i>Splinter Cell 3</i>. But <i>Max Payne 3 </i>is still a pulse-pounding A-list action game, and the necessity for every rhythm to be impeccably flush, every change clearly telegraphed, keeps the music from feeling as dangerous as it might. It lumbers majestically through two modes, moody and awesome. You can never completely forget that some of it exists solely to make running down generic corridors feel heroic. <span> </span></p>
<p>HEALTH habitually blend abrasive guitar and synth shards into clouds of heavenly opacity, tethered down by drum circles. This earthy yet ethereal sound, heralded by bands such as Boredoms and Liars, is a natural fit for <i>Max Payne 3</i>'s pressurized slowness, although here, HEALTH sound more like their remix records than their mainline catalog, tearing down dance music to a brutish 4/4 thud and building shimmering towers of junk atop it. Any expansive collection of atmospheric instrumentals coming down the pike right now is going to call to mind Symmetry's epic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16148-themes-for-an-imaginary-film/""><i>Themes for an Imaginary Film</i></a>, whose soft, rounded contours HEALTH answer with hard, brittle edges. The worst thing you can say about the score is that it sometimes effectively resorts to clichés.</p>
<p>HEALTH score easy points with liberal use of the musky attack-less string pads we call ""cinematic"" and rigid synth-and-bass arpeggios whorled with silvery John Carpenter fingerprints. The doomy chord pulses of ""Shells"" do exactly what they're meant to do: seamlessly get you hyped. You don't want to be distracted by any sonic quirks when you're trying to shoot a Brazilian commando in the face, though you might crave a few when you're not. But HEALTH also manage to sneak in things that freshen up the ears: Persian music inflections on ""The Girl"", vocal harmonies that find a whimsical seam between early music and Brian Wilson on ""+90"", and the baile funk slant of ""Max Favela"", one of the sole hints that the game takes place in sunny São Paulo and not Siberia.</p>
<p>Video gaming and music have a long history. Music helped arcade cabinets snare players. It provided auditory feedback on home consoles. In the 90s, notably in Japanese RPGs such as the <i>Final Fantasy </i>series, the irritatingly catchy ditty gave way to accomplished synthetic orchestral music, which could handle the emotional and narrative nuances emerging in games. In return, video games gave music a new market in lines such as <i>Guitar Hero</i>, plus heavily influenced new genres such as chillwave and, of course, chiptune. The core appeal of playing electronic instruments and playing video games is the same: Getting to release godlike powers in virtual space at the press of a button.</p>
<p>Back in 2005, a major artist like Tobin scoring a game felt novel, and it still slightly does. Plenty of games now use licensed music from indie bands, but few have original scores by name artists. But as games become more respectable and more like movies, as hard-pressed musicians seek out new revenue streams, and as interactivity continues to overtake passivity in our habits of virtual consumption, more frequent and closer collaborations between big-name artists and game designers look inevitable. HEALTH's quality but workmanlike release doesn't convince me that it'll be any great shakes for the standalone music market, but it's going to be fantastic for games.</p></div>"|16646.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16646-max-payne-3-ost/|7.0|Brian Howe

Since 2004, whether over the barebones creak of the early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5908-the-saga-of-mayflower-may/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Saga of Mayflower May</i></a> or the synthetically textured <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12813-little-hells/"" target=""_blank""><i>Little Hells</i></a>, Nadler's records of wispy melancholy have opened outwardly like arms, inviting the listener to stay for a permanent spell. Invariably hypnotic, Nadler's music has often felt like its own self-sustaining atmosphere-- ready and able to be inhabited, suited for the repeat button, surreal in its dream-like propensity to remove the listener from the rest of the world.</p>
<p><i>The Sister</i> is Nadler's second full-length by way of her own Box of Cedar imprint in as many years, and she's possibly never made a record that so completely meets those sequestered conditions. These eight songs feel like a turn-on, drop-out experience, an engrossing reverie of complicated characters, their twisted feelings and Nadler's muted reverence for them. That's not necessarily the best look for Nadler, who, in spite of her albums' all-encompassing essence, has managed to squeeze at least one indelible standout into every record; <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9955-songs-iii-bird-on-the-water/"" target=""_blank""><i>Songs III</i></a>, for instance, had ""Bird on Your Grave"", while last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15544-marissa-nadler/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled disc</a> sported <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12218-the-sun-always-reminds-me-of-you/"" target=""_blank"">""The Sun Always Reminds Me of You""</a> and ""Wedding"", all songs that stood apart from their settings while ably functioning within them. But these 33 minutes hang together to a fault, with songs trussed by a singular stylistic and sonic palette until the album as a whole actually starts to seem stiff. As always with Nadler, <i>The Sister</i> is still an absorbing listen, even if it is a bit conservative.</p>
<p>With the exception of the resilient, piano-anchored ""Love Again, There Is a Fire"", Nadler leads each song on <i>The Sister</i> with her acoustic guitar. For opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13173-the-wrecking-ball-company/"" target=""_blank"">""The Wrecking Ball Company""</a>, the playing is simple and direct, with a short phrase thumbed through the steady drums and webbed vocals; during <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13570-apostle/"" target=""_blank"">""Apostle""</a>, she refashions the celestial heights of James Blackshaw's 12-string compositions with modesty. Nadler's grown substantially as a guitarist, meaning that her notes are crisper and her lines more mesmeric. But she operates exclusively in those alternate modes-- that is, elegant or elementary-- across all of <i>The Sister</i>, meaning that the excellent supporting cast she's gathered here falls behind her direction rather than helping to drive it. Carter Tanton's intriguing electric textures on closer ""Your Heart is a Twisted Vine"" feel more like an accessory than a building block; ditto the spectral harmonies and the faint serial keyboards tacked onto the end of ""Christine"". Like the songs they support, there's nothing wrong with any of these moments. They just blur into one another, sublimating into a whole that's occasionally void of definition. </p>
<p>At various points throughout Nadler's career, there's been compulsory evidence to consider her something of a ""breakout"" artist. At the height of the freak-folk moment, she fell just short of the ""alabaster queen"" status that she later pledged; in the following years, she signed to Kemado Records, a label whose beard-and-beer-can metal and sleaze-ball rock roster didn't buoy Nadler toward many ideal audiences; when she subsequently <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/37924-xasthur-and-marissa-nadler-collaborate-on-new-album/"" target=""_blank"">lent her spook</a> to an album by black-metal mystery Xasthur, she again missed her chance to connect wholesale with an expanding crowd. Last year, it felt as if she was giving herself a new start by crowd-funding her first self-titled release on her own label; that record, in retrospect, seems impregnably confident and adventurous, where several perfect bits of country loneliness came countered by a half-dozen variably gothic trances. <i>The Sister</i> is Nadler's most narcotic album to date, and she also continues to sharpen her skills as a writer, beguiling with alliteration and distant images that should cause listeners to daydream with wonder. But <i>The Sister</i> ultimately comes across as, at best, a retread done well and, at worst, a retreat into previously approved territory by an artist who has noticeably improved as a tactician.</p>
<p>In this way, <i>The Sister</i> recalls clear Nadler forebear Buffy Sainte-Marie, another songwriter who, at her best, built albums that felt apart from the rest of the world, even as they wove together the very familiar and the very abstract. (Like Nadler, she also had a way with Leonard Cohen songs.) Sainte-Marie surrounded occasional great albums with stacks of entirely good, functional music, never able to progress definitively despite obvious improvements on multiple fronts. Still, there's no shame in a string of albums that are at least ""entirely good,"" a streak that Nadler has yet to break-- even if <i>The Sister</i> feels like the first minor album of her career.</p></div>"|16662.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16662-the-sister/|7.0|Grayson Currin

We become more educated listeners, better listeners, perhaps more adventurous listeners? We're trying to understand how these gems stayed hidden, so that we can scoop down and pick them up next time, 49ers panning through disc three's outtakes and dub edits for something shiny. It's functionally the same logic we've been fed since grade school: Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. </p>
<p>So forgive me: My favorite part about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1149-drexciya/"" target=""_blank"">Drexciya</a>'s <i>Journey of the Deep Sea Dweller II</i> is how little it teaches me about modern dance music. Drexciya are cloistered, pugnacious, local, racial, and exclusionary to the point of distraction. I immediately understand why their limited, obscure, geeky material was missed the first time around. No one could figure out Detroit techno in the mid 1990s, and they still can't. (<a href=""http://boilerroom.tv/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Boiler Room</a>, an organization that broadcasts live, secretive DJ sets, announced their <a href=""http://boilerroom.tv/boiler-room-detroit-anthony-shake-shakir-mike-huckaby-rick-wilhite-jay-daniel-kyle-hall-manuel-gonzales/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first-ever Detroit simulacast</a> as ""what we originally wanted to call 'Boiler Room 313,' but have been advised to call 'Boiler Room Detroit' instead."" Stay provincial, D.) Drexciya has no corollary in a world in which even underground dance musicians continent-hop, establish vanity imprints, and use remixes as marketing tools. </p>
<p>So forget about added perspective. What Clone's <i>Journey of the Deep Sea Dweller</i> series (there are to be four volumes) threatens-- like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"" target=""_blank"">New Order</a>'s <i>Substance</i> or Creedence Clearwater Revival's <i>Chronicle</i>-- is to define an act that, for those who experienced it firsthand, was already well-defined. A collector friend griped recently about Clone's re-ordering of a serialized, conceptual catalog, though he did so while noting that the original 12""s-- released on Detroit-centric labels like Submerge, Underground Resistance, and Tresor-- were poorly pressed. Shuffling these records has only proven the durability of Drexciya's sounds and concepts. By picking and choosing from the duo's catalog, Clone has removed the burden of totality; we don't have to absorb every Drexciya single in chronological order all at once and are therefore afforded a convenient last fraction of the puzzle the early birds received.</p>
<p><i>Vol. II</i> continues in much the same manner as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16175-journey-of-the-deep-sea-dweller-i/"" target=""_blank""><i>Vol. I</i></a>: short tracks of spackled, analog funk dominate, offering occasional clues about Drexciya's sci-fi mystery. Like <i>Vol. I</i>, the selections here are mostly drawn from Drexciya's early run of singles. Wild high-pass filters, like those found on the maniacal ""Danger Bay"", provide plenty of twine for James Stinson and Gerald Donald to bind their clapping 808s. There are some beautiful stylistic diversions-- ""Aqua Jujidsu"" sounds like someone took an Instagram photo of drum'n'bass, ""Unknown Journey II"" is a particularly wily slab of electro-- but the music here doesn't exist to shine light on 1990s dance music. We are better off attempting to map ""Positron Island""'s longitude in relation to ""Danger Bay"" than we are positioning Drexciya in the genealogy of dance music. Both are going to result in shitload of guesswork, but the former allows us to dream with Drexciya instead of at them. </p>
<p>And dreaming with them is way more fun. Imagine the sad, ghoulish piano man playing in ""Davey Jones Locker"", or the exquisite, proud charge ahead in ""Journey Home"". The twinkling arpeggios that speckle ""Neon Falls"" speak for themselves. These are kernels of techno so dense and potent that they require no context whatsoever. <i>Journey of the Deep Sea Dweller II</i>, refreshingly, doesn't bother to give us any.</p></div>"|16678.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16678-journey-of-the-deep-sea-dweller-ii/|8.6|Andrew Gaerig

Her deeply political sophomore LP runs the risk of becoming another of the countless failed examples of those singer-songwriters whose best intentions fall short of qualifying as either good pop or moving rhetoric. It's a tough trick, translating your deeply held political conventions into good tunes. Somehow, though, Burhenn pulls it off on<i> Generals</i>. Back with her faithful producer Richard Swift, who continues his hot streak behind the boards, Burhenn manages to retain the pop smarts (and Biblical undertones) of <i>Fire</i>, reshaping them into a timely form of righteousness.</p>
<p>Burhenn was inspired by the 1963 Richard Avedon photo <a href=""http://iconicphotos.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/richard_avedon.jpg?w=700&amp;h=554"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Generals of the Daughters of the American Revolution""</a>, a representation of the spirit of righteous battle transformed over the centuries into a mirror of the lineage-based aristocracy the founding American patriots were escaping. This irony pervades <i>Generals</i>, but Burhenn cleverly updates it for the modern moment, when real political action (and music's role in it) is too often trumped by crude capitalist pragmatism. She sings it better than I can explain it, in the opening track ""Karma Debt"": ""We hold our horns like credit cards/ And hope to pay the rent."" That sadly poetic equation of a horn-- typically the instrument used to rouse an army to fight-- with a credit card suggests that while Burhenn was initially moved by Avedon's photograph, the fading memory of <a href=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_OPXraSbByUc/SY7pI4W5hYI/AAAAAAAAAZU/NQ4N4hexyXg/s400/fascist.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Woody Guthrie's guitar</a> casts an equal pall over this work. A similar sentiment about the role of politics as unfettered exploitation can be found in the opening moments of the album's rollicking first single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13200-generals/"" target=""_blank"">""Generals""</a>: ""I need a political job/ In a blue-collar town/ So I can pay my rent.""</p>
<p>A lot of Mynabirds fans were taken aback by the sound of ""Generals"" a couple of months ago. I, for one, wouldn't have bet that the group that reimagined Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris on its first LP to follow that up with a track that sounds like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2288-the-kills/"" target=""_blank"">the Kills</a>. While it's true that <i>Generals</i> is often a much more stripped-down, if not plain uglier, album in parts than its predecessor, it's by design. War is still hell. Burhenn and Swift have added a dirty electronic patina to parts of the record, and while the argument could certainly be made that ""late-1990s"" isn't the best look for everyone, it can't be denied that on the whole, this album presents a much more varied palette than <i>Fire</i>, without ever coming close to sounding dilettantish. ""Body of Work"" and ""Radiator Sister"" are danceable concoctions of rhythm and melody-- the former driven by piano, the latter by what sounds like marimba. ""Mightier Than the Sword"" is a stark tone poem, Burhenn splitting her vocals in a way that nods toward Dirty Projectors. The piano in ""Disaster"" has an unmediated physicality to it, like you're hearing an unmastered scratch-track left in the song.</p>
<p>Yet past all the stylistic flourishes, <i>Generals </i>is openhearted, politically engaged, feminist pop that, miraculously, never veers into schmaltz (or worse, didacticism). Over the staggered waltz of ""Wolf Mother"", she sounds beat up, but determined to keep plowing ahead, perhaps to raise her own standing army of revolutionary daughters. It's not everyday you hear Jean-Paul Sartre quoted on an indie record, but ending ""Body of Work"" with ""Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you"" perfectly sums up the ideas at play on the album. It's not a matter of beating the bastards at their own game, though. Burhenn bookends the record with the plea, ""I'd give it all, for a legacy of love,"" signaling that she's willing to sacrifice personal gain for the broader good, instead of setting the whole thing ablaze. Maybe it's just her voice (and god, <i>that voice</i>), but I believe her.</p></div>"|16680.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16680-generals/|7.5|Eric Harvey

After more than a decade of noise and drone made in small editions for various labels, the Ohio-based artist combined his obsessions into one enveloping six-song set. But it turns out that <i>Llanos</i> was also a prelude, because in the past year Shiflet has made two albums for Type that are just as good, perhaps better. And they play like two sides of a coin: <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/_type/sets/mike-shiflet-sufferers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Sufferers</i></a>, released last October, weaves patiently through a field of abstract sounds, and now <i>Merciless</i> paints a similar landscape with an even richer palette.</p>
<p>It's also a more aggressive palette, though just a bit-- <i>Sufferers </i>also had its share of dense noise. But Shiflet's music is more interesting for how he pieces his sounds together than what sounds he uses. The power's more in the wall than in the bricks, so to speak. It doesn't matter much if he's doling out brutal racket or riding a rising drone. Either way, the connections between those textures, and Shiflet's knack for massaging them into tonal hybrids, form a kind of sonic narrative. Every moment is inseparable from what comes before and after.</p>
<p>On <i>Merciless</i>,<i> </i>Shiflet's narrative sounds rather random at first. Opener ""Feeble Breaths"" emerges cautiously in shards of static, as if he's searching for a radio station in the middle of the woods, or groping in the dark to set a needle onto a record. But the track eventually coagulates into a pulsing loop, and from then on Shiflet's roller coaster stays in permanent forward motion. It gathers steam with crackling sheens, meditative oscillations, layered echoes, and an especially compelling piece called <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/_type/exodus-and-exile"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Exodus and Exile""</a> that evokes classical minimalism, film-noir score, and space-bound transmission.</p>
<p>The best narratives are most compelling at the end, though, and Shiflet accordingly puts extra juice into the 16-minute, album-closing <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/_type/merciless"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>. Adding Marina Peterson's cello, <a href=""http://www.pitchfork.com/artists/28288-c-spencer-yeh/"">C. Spencer Yeh</a>'s violin, and Jason Zeh's tape manipulations, he erects a windy, creaking drone that sounds both patient and urgent. It's a bit bombastic, but Shiflet keeps all the sounds grounded and tactile in a way that you can almost feel through the speakers. By the end, the track descends into more disparate timbres, not unlike the notes that began the album. That full-circle arc makes it tempting to call <i>Merciless</i> a new peak, but given Shiflet's history, it would be unwise to limit expectations of what he can do next.</p></div>"|16786.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16786-merciless/|7.3|Marc Masters

This is true whether we're talking about the glacial pace of their songs, the glacial pace at which they release them, or their artistic progression. In the 13 years since <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7151-agaetis-byrjun/"" target=""_blank"">Ágætis Byrjun</a> </i>became the first and possibly only post-rock crossover record, Sigur Rós have edged closer to actual pop while still maintaining their singular place amongst many consumers' record collections: The band's stamp of approval is pretty much the only way a lot of people are dealing with 10-minute songs or an invented language. It's a tremendous example of a band that's managed to own its lane while making it incrementally wider, and their consistently positive reception gives you the idea that the only way Sigur Rós could make a <i>bad </i>record is if they made one that was wholly unrecognizable as their own. Well, you won't confuse <i>Valtari </i>as being the work of anyone else, if only because their sixth studio album so flattens and narrows Sigur Rós' aesthetic to the point where the title scans as self-parody. ""Valtari"" is Icelandic for ""steamroller,"" by the way.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">""It sounds corny, but when I listen to it, it puts images in my head. I feel like I'm walking up a mountain alone."" This is how bassist Georg Holm <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/spring-music-preview-20120405/sigur-ros-valtari-19691231"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recently described <i>Valtari </i>to Rolling Stone</a>, and I find that to be interesting on two fronts, the initial being there's a good chance you had no idea that Sigur Rós <i>had </i>a bassist, let alone what his name is. All too ironic that it's perhaps the only time Holm makes any sort of statement on <i>Valtari</i>, which unfortunately gives weight to the unfair perception of Sigur Rós as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28494-jonsi/"" target=""_blank"">Jónsi</a> and anonymous conjurers. It's a disappointment <i>and </i>a missed opportunity, since after the release of 2005's vibrant <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7155-takk/"" target=""_blank"">Takk</a>--</i> still their most diverse and consistently accessible record-- the most interesting music Sigur Rós have made is relative to their implementation of rhythm, culminating with 2008's clodhopping Animal Collective homage ""Gobbledigook"" and Jónsi's hypercolored solo album, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14098-go/"" target=""_blank"">Go</a>. </i>It's debatable whether the rhythm section was jettisoned in the composition stages or whether they're simply rendered immobile under thick layers of orchestral amber. Either way, <i>Valtari</i> forgoes the promising lean toward pop songcraft of their recent LPs and the volcanic dynamics of their earliest material with only pretty vacancy as a replacement.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">About two minutes into <i>Valtari,</i> Jónsi's vocals rise out of a brackish pool of strings, choirs, and piano to tease out a melody. About two minutes later, there's a small rupture of distorted bowed guitars and organ, and two minutes after that, it glides to a serene denouement. That describes opener ""<span style=""background: white;"">Êg Anda</span>"" and also basically more than half of <i>Valtari, </i>leaving you to fashion highlights out of relativity. The positive side of <i>Valtari</i>'s four-year incubation period is evidenced by ""<span style=""background: white;"">Varúð"", the way it effortlessly combines </span>waterlogged piano chords and a brassy fanfare. Yet while the cymbal-bashing crescendo it builds toward is the most viscerally rewarding thing here, anyone familiar with the past decade of Sigur Rós has heard it dozens of times.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Which brings me back to ""it puts images in my head."" The evocative nature of Sigur Rós' music has always been a major draw, but I think the more telling part of Holm's quote is ""I feel like I'm walking up a mountain."" Indeed, due to Sigur Rós' unwillingness to exert any sort of artistic will on the listener, <i>Valtari</i> feels like work, a trudge, asking for too much by way of demanding nothing concrete. Even the controversially blank <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7152-sigur-ros/"" target=""_blank""><i>() </i></a>had staunch conviction in its commitment to supernatural ethereality-- not to mention subtly impressive melodies and some of their most unsettling peaks. If you're familiar only with Sigur Rós' studio albums, you might hear <i>Valtari </i>as a maximalist version of <i>()-- </i>which would essentially negate the entire point of <i>()</i>. Too loud to truly pass for ambient music, yet too invertebrate to accommodate visceral pleasures, <i>Valtari </i>is most often simply <i>there</i>, the passage of time distinguished only by the occasional shift in texture. The drum sounds that close out ""<span style=""background: white;"">Rembihnûtur""</span> are a nice touch and establish a possible connection between Sigur Rós and the likes of Balam Acab, as do the gamelan-like, detuned bells of the title track. But if you get to that point, Jónsi all but disappears on the final two tracks, and consequently, <i>Valtari's </i>tether to sounding like Sigur Rós rather than indistinct audio Calgon.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">I suppose it's always worth remembering to review what you got as opposed to what you wanted, and as Jónsi explained to <i>Q </i>magazine, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45911-sigur-ros-announce-new-album/"">""the music kind of just rolls over you… in a good way.""</a> So it can all sound incredibly grumpy to take issue with <i>Valtari</i> for staying in cruise control, no different from criticizing a day at the beach for being too hot. Well, if we're gonna continue down the path of that metaphor for Sigur Rós' longest-gestating record, it's more like the first beach day of the year and you find out you can't go surfing, can't throw a Frisbee, can't start a bonfire, can't even go in the ocean. The problem isn't that <i>Valtari</i> aspires to beauty, even if it's a commonplace, celestial understanding of it. Sigur Rós have proven they can make indelible music that's pretty and unpredictable, pretty and melodic, pretty and unnerving, pretty and inspiring. <i>Valtari </i>wants to be pretty and that's it.</p>

PiL (as they're now known in abbreviated form) are best known for pioneering the post-punk sound with their meandering, dub-influenced music that seemed to creak and creep rather than bang out conventional riff-rock; but for all their supposed influence, how many classic albums of theirs could you name? I'd wager three: <i>First Issue</i>, <i>Metal Box</i>, and <i>The </i><i>Flowers of Romance</i>, but only <i>Metal Box</i> is an airtight case for canonization. Following that strong three-album run, the band embarked on a turbulent course marked by slipshod albums and regrettable production choices, epitomizing themselves as a sort of tragic case of potential gone unfulfilled. But for a band that built its name on ripping up the rule book, what do Public Image Ltd. sound like 20 years since their last album, and over 30 since their first?</p>
<p>It's hard to decide if <i>This Is PiL</i> is a surprise or merely par for the course. Surprising, because it's not terrible-- it's arguably the band's best effort since 1984's maligned but salvageable <i>This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get</i>, and is slightly marred by similar issues of production and questionable songwriting. Which makes it exactly what we should have expected, right? Mixed in with the self-conscious imageering, down to the album title and opening track, which determinedly declares ""This! Is! PiL!"" over sluggish backing, it's also hard to tell whether or not they're taking the piss-- as on 1985's marketing send-up <i>Album</i>-- or if Lydon is ill-advisedly trying to re-establish himself. Either way, once that intro is out of the way, his band suddenly sounds hungry, alive, and passionate.</p>
<p>There's a lot of fury on <i>This Is PiL</i>, though some of it rings hollow; ""The Room I Am In"" takes ham-fisted potshots at UK council housing but comes off confused and rambling, with one of Lydon's more ridiculous vocal performances. Meanwhile, the venom on ""Fool"" seems general and misdirected, and ""It Said That"" is an incomprehensible mess. All that aside, the album's opening run is enough to remind you what you might have loved about the band in the past. ""One Drop"" and ""Deeper Water"" both feature sterling performances from Lydon, and it's eerie how his voice appears to have escaped the ravages of time. He's as shrill and as powerfully bleating as ever. His lyrics are still nothing to write home about, but they sound formidable all the same delivered in that familiar, angry froth of saliva and bile, all harsh stutters and long, drawn-out notes.</p>
<p>After that clunky start, the rest of the band sounds impressively together given that Lydon is the only founding member present, knocking out <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2231-joy-division/"" target=""_blank"">Joy Division</a>-dark fretwork on ""Deeper Water"" and taut, squiggly funk on ""Human"". Part of that rigorousness comes with the no-frills production, which leaves the band in a clean antiseptic room, trading personality or idiosyncrasy for pure functionality. There's no <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4615-jah-wobble/"" target=""_blank"">Jah Wobble</a> here, nor even a Keith Levene-- the band works as a faceless vehicle for the songs, so when the writing falters, the whole thing collapses (the annoying ""Lollipop Opera""). Otherwise it's the sound of a particularly competent rock band with a deranged singer, replacing the strung-out, mentally damaged echo chambers of yore with mechanical grooves.</p>
<p><i>This Is PiL</i>'s final two songs hint at the experimental dubby glory of the band's heyday, particularly the nine-minute closer ""Out of the Woods"", which approximates' <i>Metal Box</i>'s uneasy stagger for the only truly menacing, challenging moment on <i>This Is PiL</i>. It's an album that doesn't add anything to a cult legend band's legacy, but it does the unexpected duty of salvaging that legacy, showing a savvy mastermind in John Lydon, who's apparently capable of at least mimicking old glories. It would have been a shame if the band's swan song was left as <i>That What Is Not</i>, released 20 years ago now. <i>This Is PiL</i> isn't a magical solution per se, but for now, it'll do-- a reminder of the band's former genius and a treat for longtime fans who should appreciate at least half the album as solid PiL work. Historical importance aside, they're a band built on unreliability and inconsistency, and <i>This Is PiL</i> maintains that reputation.</p></div>"|16668.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16668-this-is-pil/|6.3|Andrew Ryce

Detractors of <a href=""http://reginaspektor.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Regina Spektor</a>'s particular brand of clown-nose gutpunch pop will be delighted to know that this is an actual lyric from her new album, <i>What We Saw From the Cheap Seats</i>. Coming toward the middle of the sparse piano ballad ""Firewood"", the line is a handy embodiment of all the criticisms commonly lobbed at the 32-year-old's music: It's mawkish! It's puerile! It sounds like Peter Pan with a Tori Amos complex! And if you think all that's missing is some kind of quirky vocal affect, just hold out for the exaggerated, cartoonish gasps a few songs later.</p>
<p>Living as we do in the dawning of the ""Age of Adorkable,"" it's all too easy to dismiss Regina Spektor as an emblem of the kind of coy, indie-girl stereotype that ""Portlandia""'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XM3vWJmpfo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Put a Bird on It""</a> skit mocked or that prompts me to email Julie Klausner's manifesto <a href=""http://julieklausner.tumblr.com/post/6331886267/dont-fear-the-dowager-a-valentine-to-maturity-an"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Don't Fear the Dowager""</a> to everyone I know when I see someone over 30 wearing a romper. But let's not be too hasty in our dismissals of Regina Spektor. Because although her most recent album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13184-far/"" target=""_blank""><i>Far</i></a> was cloying in the extreme and brought the most polarizing elements of her music to the fore, it doesn't change the fact that her earlier stuff showed a daring kind of verve.</p>
<p>Moscow-born, Bronx-raised Spektor's breakout album was 2003's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7739-soviet-kitsch/"" target=""_blank""><i>Soviet Kitsch</i></a>, which had a reeling, drunken-sailor lurch and a mouth to match. She blurted lines like ""Marianne's a bitch!"" and ""You don't love your girlfriend!"" with transgressive glee, and the tone of songs like ""Ode to Divorce"" and ""Us"" oscillated so wildly from sad to sweet that it was difficult to predict what was coming around the next bend, even sometimes when you'd heard the song before. Its follow-up, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9043-begin-to-hope/"" target=""_blank""><i>Begin to Hope</i></a>, lodged knotty, bittersweet emotions beneath the floorboards of more conventional-sounding pop songs (even its big, feel-good hit <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wigqKfLWjvM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Fidelity""</a> has a creeping and unmistakable strain of melancholy: ""I hear in my mind all of these voices""). Not every one of Spektor's songs finds the appropriate balance between sentiment and grit (and, when they don't, they always have an excess of the former). But at its best, her music isn't quirk for quirk's sake: It feels like a person trying-- and occasionally succeeding-- in capturing something true about the rushing, motley rhythms of life. A song like ""Us"" is the roving camera work of someone trying to take it all in, and playing the footage back to us to show that there are rarely frames without the coexistence of flowers and garbage.</p>
<p>Neither as inert as the syrupy <i>Far</i> but still lacking the roller coaster-whiplash of <i>Soviet Kitsch</i>'s tonal shifts, <i>What We Saw From the Cheap Seats</i> moves at the pace of a parade float. And though it's not a particularly thrilling ride, it's a speed that allows Spektor's roving eye to document plenty of observations: The bubblegum marching-band number ""Don't Leave Me (Ne Me Quitte Pas)"" watches kids in the Bronx ""sledding down snow-covered slopes,"" while the lead-off single ""All the Rowboats"" tries to personify the inanimate objects in a museum where the ""masterpieces [are] serving maximum sentences."" If <i>Far</i> felt like it was stuck in neverland, though, <i>Cheap Seats</i> feels like something of a progression for tackling fleeting youth as one of its main themes. On ""Firewood"", she wistfully muses on the passage of time: ""You'll take the clock off of the wall, and wish that it was lying.""</p>
<p>As ever, though, Spektor's music is at its most affecting when she cuts out the baubles and goes for the most direct approach. The true tearjerker on <i>Cheap Seats</i> is ""How"", a soulful, no-frills ""Unchained Melody"" nod that recalls <i>Begin to Hope</i>'s stunner ""Summer in the City"". But for every ""How"" there's an excruciating ""Ballad of a Politician"", and for every line like ""How""'s crushingly simple address to a former flame, ""You're a guest here, now,"" there's a line that you feel like you have seen before embroidered on a throw pillow (""Love more to get more love"").</p>
<p>Now six albums into her career, Spektor presents both her sentimentalism and her more childlike qualities with a certain defiance: You can't miss every toy you've ever owned if you refused to trash your favorites. (And like so many aging class clowns, she's not quite parted with the habit of interrupting serious moments with funny noises.) Though it rarely makes good on the promise of her earlier songs, <i>Cheap Seats</i> is polarizing, and by now most listeners will have already decided whether or not they can stomach Spektor's peculiar kind of vérité, glass-half-full optimism. ""Today we're younger than we're ever going to be,"" she sings on the opening track. Which, I suppose, is one way of looking at life.</p></div>"|16670.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16670-what-we-saw-from-the-cheap-seats/|6.3|Lindsay Zoladz

The song's title suggests Coyne is singing to the man upstairs, but he could very well be directing that line at Sharpe-- i.e., the born-again alias/alter ego of L.A. music-scene lifer Alex Ebert.</p>
<p>No doubt, Ebert has given skeptics plenty of reason to question his motives and identity, given his seemingly convenient transformation from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCUrU0GKYHo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the asymmetrical-haircutted frontman of early-2000s dance-punk chancers Ima Robot</a> into the hirsute, hippy-dippy leader of Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, who arrived in 2009 packaged in a faux-religious-cult gambit on loan from the dormant Polyphonic Spree. But while Ebert had assumed a new character-- one he devised to serve as a beacon of positivity during a rehab stint-- its personality was nonetheless vague: The Zeros' debut album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13852-up-from-below/"" target=""_blank""><i>Up From Below</i></a>, saw Ebert rifling through various guises and voices-- country-politan crooner (""Carries On""), flower-child folkie (""Jade""), Arcade Fired-up preacher-man (""40 Day Dream""), hysterical Spanish spaghetti-western shrieker (""Kisses Over Babylon"")-- like outfits on a thrift-store rack. You can't begrudge an artist's right to reinvent himself, but Ebert's transformation into Edward had the effect of feeling both calculated and noncommittal at the same time.</p>
<p>From the get-go, <i>Here</i> foregrounds the messianic qualities of the Sharpe persona, with nine songs centered thematically around god, church, and various all-you-need-is-love platitudes; the Johnny Cash-copping opening track introduces Ebert as a ""Man on Fire"" who wants the ""whole damn world to come dance with me,"" while ""Dear Believer"" not so modestly declares ""reaching for heaven is what I'm on Earth to do."" But rather than push Ebert and co. to more ridiculous degrees of theatrical religiosity, <i>Here</i> is a surprisingly humble, homespun affair. In contrast to the band's debut, <i>Here</i> sounds more genuinely like the sort of mellowed-out roots-rock record that you'd expect from a dance-punk burnout looking to sober up and simplify. Or, at the very least, it's the ramshackle but accessible 1970s Topanga Canyon throwback album that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13645-what-will-we-be/"" target=""_blank"">Warner Bros. were hoping they could get out of Devendra Banhart</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully a good 20 minutes shorter than its predecessor, <i>Here</i> is an album that gets by on casual, low-key charm rather than showboating gestures; though the Magnetic Zeros' membership numbers into the double digits, a good deal of this album sounds like it could've been recorded by a lone foot-stomping folksinger, carrying over the intimate, around-the-kitchen-table ambience of Ebert's 2011 solo release, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15252-alexander/"" target=""_blank""><i>Alexander</i></a>. The wood-cabin-cozy production is especially beneficial to the most lightweight material; where the island accents of ""One Love to Another"" threaten to degenerate into cod-reggae caricature, the song's luminous, playful presentation makes it sound uncannily like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16651-ram/"" target=""_blank"">something wafting out of Paul and Linda's farmhouse</a>. And even the songs that make use of the full ensemble do so in subtle, tasteful fashion, as exemplified by the dewy electric-guitar droplets, distant choral harmonies, and soothing brass fanfares that color the daydreamy centerpiece ""Mayla"".</p>
<p>Most significantly, Ebert sounds much more relaxed, less affected here as a vocalist, settling into a pleasing, conversational tone that cheekily deflates the pomp inherent to his adopted persona (from ""Dear Believer"": ""The world's gettin' heavy on my shoulders as a child/ But I let it all go to my waist""). But this evolution does come at the expense of his more feisty foil Jade Castrinos; where she served as the grounding influence to Ebert's unrestrained whimsy on <i>Up From Below</i>, on <i>Here</i>, her excitable solo turns on the honky-gospel hoedown ""That's What's Up"" and the histrionic southern-rock wailer ""Fiya Wata"" sound too in-your-face and out of place amid <i>Here</i>'s laidback, sun-stroked vibe. <i>Here</i> may constitute the next chapter in the ever-evolving mythology of Edward Sharpe, but really, it's more effective as a means of getting to know Alex Ebert.</p></div>"|16675.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16675-here/|6.0|Stuart Berman

These are the concerns of <i>A Monument</i>, the second LP by Portland's <a href=""http://www.tufawning.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tu Fawning</a>. ""If my skin had scales and colorful details/ We'd travel the roads and never go home,"" Corrina Repp laments on opener ""Anchor"". It seems possible she is a woman who literally desires to be reptilian; trailed by a dry shaker rattle, her voice slinks and coils over big drums and arid, rolling guitar, as if already propelled by a hundred tiny bones. But that wish is also the album's main hangup taken to an extreme: You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you just might find you can make some dense and darkly lovely music about it.</p>
<p>It may seem funny to talk about this band in terms of its lyrical themes. Tu Fawning were originally formed as some experimental woodshed for Portland musicians Repp and Joe Haege (she of a long-running solo folk career, he of trios Menomena and 31 Knots). Their 2008 debut EP, <i>Secession</i>, and their first proper record, 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14857-hearts-on-hold/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hearts on Hold</i></a>, seemed like sonic moodboards more than anything else-- scraps of 1920s nightclub jazz, baroque piano flourishes, and the kind of stark percussion that's referred to as ""tribal"" all basted together into patchworks only generally suggestive of coherence, purpose, or an emotional core. (An exception was <a href=""http://tufawning.bandcamp.com/track/apples-and-oranges"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Apples and Oranges""</a>, a piano-heavy, painfully frank song about trying to discern the origins of a basket of fruit but also about reconciling friendship and kindness with the soul-stealing tendencies of crippling depression.) On those first releases, strands of ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" threatened to outstrip all instances of the English language, and the words that were there were often buoyed off and away by waves of sound that rolled and arced endlessly and switched back upon themselves.</p>
<p>But something happened over the past few years: Tu Fawning became really good at writing honest-to-goodness songs. ""Wager"", the album's clear triumph, is the closest the band allowed itself to a pop single, with the giddy guitar crunch of the pre-chorus leaping straight into the wide-open arms of the big, hopeful chorus: ""There'll be no confusion with this one, I'm certain."" Overall, <i>A Monument</i> inverts the group's earlier approach, allowing the atmospherics to act in service of the songs rather than necessitating the whole endeavor. ""It was another arcane soiree/ Of debutantes and men with sway,"" Haege sings on ""To Break Into"" over a swell of menacing horns and interlaced ripples of electric guitar; Repp later echoes the same verse before Haege returns with those horns again, and some eerily plaintive piano, all padded out by a crush of guitar, his voice close to a desperate growl, hers cool and smooth. ""Bones"", the album's final track, calls up the hallmarks of both Afro-pop and woozy, golden-era Black Sabbath, then spills into an ethereal, tempo-shifting closer, at the end of which it's not difficult to imagine Repp ascending into some bank of sun-ringed clouds, platinum-haired and beatific.</p>
<p>Stylistically, <i>A Monument</i> is no less of a jumble than anything else the band has done-- Repp and Haege and co. are just better at managing the mess than they were before. Sometimes it seems as if Tu Fawning watched the world watching <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26688-florence-and-the-machine/"" target=""_blank"">Florence and the Machine</a> (and/or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"" target=""_blank"">Beach House</a>, perhaps more analagous in terms of sound and general scope) and thought, ""Time to step it up."" Or perhaps they're just slowly becoming a better band, which is this funny thing that can happen when artists are given space and time and not crushed under the weight of popular expectation before they have a chance to know their own minds. There's a sense throughout <i>A Monument,</i> like the fugues and false starts that tangle at its heart, that Tu Fawning are on the edge of something-- pressed against it, blood pounding-- but, for now, remain suspended in judgement. There's something waiting for them beyond this moment, but there's beauty here, too.</p></div>"|16779.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16779-a-monument/|7.0|Rachael Maddux

For this duo, it literally sounded like a matter of life and death. While the chaotic, fist-pumping anthems of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12965-post-nothing/"" target=""_blank""><i>Post-Nothing </i></a>were as reckless, hormonal, and pleasure-obsessed as any teenager, escapism wasn't an option. Singer/guitarist Brian King and drummer David Prowse have admitted that Japandroids were shutting down the operation after years of going nowhere, and <i>Post-Nothing </i>was as meant as a swan song more than a debut. And for a half hour, they played with the desperation of young men about to lose something vital forever. That urgency is rarely a renewable resource, so as more time passed between the excellent 2010 single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11913-younger-us/"" target=""_blank"">""Younger Us""</a> and <i>Post-Nothing</i>'s follow-up, the more worrisome its lyrics became. Where they had once vowed to go into adulthood kicking and screaming, had they survived only to surrender? That was the question every time King began a verse with what Tony Soprano called the lowest form of conversation: ""Remember when?"" <i> </i></p>
<p>""Younger Us"" is now the sixth song on the awe-inspiring <i>Celebration Rock</i>, and nothing has changed except how its context raises the possibility that it doesn't actually have to be about <i>them</i>. This shift in perspective is crucial to understanding how <i>Celebration Rock </i>can somehow manage to completely dwarf its impressive predecessor despite being made the same exact way-- same personnel, same producer, same minimal-overdub policy, same instruments, same eight-song tracklist. Hell, even the cover's pretty much the same. But in writing about something other than the experience of being Japandroids, the duo taps into a power greater than itself to address impossibly vast and elemental topics-- friendship, lust, revenge, art, self-actualization-- with songs every bit as big. The uptick in ragged and resonant guitar-based indie rock has dredged up a lot of deserved <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3559-the-replacements/"" target=""_blank"">Replacements</a> comparisons, but I don't think anything's captured their spirit to the extent of <i>Celebration Rock</i>: it's the Mats who had the chops to pay homage to Big Star, the irreverence to cover ""Black Diamond"", and the empathy to write ""Sixteen Blue"".</p>
<p>Combined with the revved-up riff on opener ""The Nights of Wine and Roses"", King's first lyric (""Long lit up tonight/ And still drinking/ Don't we have anything to live for?/ Well of course we do/ But until they come true/ We're drinking"") recalls a time when <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2010-the-hold-steady/"" target=""_blank"">the Hold Steady</a> shot for something similar. But whether it was their tendency to write from a storytelling perspective or generally avoid choruses in favor of inside jokes, the Hold Steady always created some sort of distance from the listener. I've never been fully convinced that Craig Finn and co. wrote about people who'd actually listen to their music. Not so here, where Japandroids take on something like a Woody Guthrie anthropological approach. <span style=""background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"">""On a lot of this new record, we actually tried to simulate the sound of what we<span class=""apple-converted-space""> </span><i>thought</i></span><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span style=""background: white;""> </span></span><span style=""background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"">the crowd would do during the songs,"" King told us in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45701-japandroids-talk-new-album/"" target=""_blank"">an interview</a> back in March. ""Dave and I were in the studio just screaming out as if we were in the audience at our own show.""</span></p>
<p>And indeed, Japandroids are dealing with the real populist stuff on <i>Celebration Rock. </i>Sometimes the roots are exposed; ""American Girl"" gets a nod during the cow-punk rodeo of ""Evil's Sway"" and ""Adrenaline Nightshift"" follows in the footsteps of the Replacements' ""Alex Chilton"", honoring the lineage of transformative rock music by adding to it. But mostly, it's in how <i>Celebration Rock</i> treats every day like the last day of school, raising a glass to the past, living in the moment and going into the future feeling fucking invincible. It offers itself up as a social lubricant, music meant for radios, keg parties, road trips; the extent to which plural pronouns exceed singular is no accident. </p>
<p>And this is all achievable since the first thing you take from <i>Celebration Rock </i>is just how much they've improved in terms of capturing pure sound, everything hitting louder <i>and </i>clearer than before. <i>Post-Nothing </i>was an emotional blast and also a sonic blur, Prowse and King recreating their cramped live show to the point where they may as well have been in mono. Likewise, some songs lived and died on a single riff or lyric. <i>Celebration Rock</i> remains structurally minimal but incredibly dense, fashioning a bionic kind of rock music from the best parts without a moment that lacks crowd-pleasing purpose. The verse melodies take more chances and any time a guitar chord suspends, there's almost always a windup of a drum fill anticipating the duo gleefully throwing themselves into a flashmob-like chorus. If <i>Celebration Rock</i> were much longer than 35 minutes, it might actually be exhausting, the emotional and melodic onslaught so overwhelming that a <i>Gun Club cover </i>of all things is the only time you might be able to catch your breath between the fireworks that begin and end the record<i>.</i></p>
<p>But ""For the Love of Ivy"" cleaves <i>Celebration Rock </i>in a way that makes structural sense. The first half feels like the one obsessed with classic rock legacy, and initially you're left reeling from the wallop of ""Fire's Highway"" and ""The Nights of Wine and Roses""'s haymaker hooks. There are micro-level pleasures to appreciate too-- the Tom Petty rip might get the crowd going, but that little pivot before the chorus of ""Evil's Sway"" where it shifts from a breakneck rant to a major-key bridge is really where I hear a band making a huge leap in songwriting technique. </p>
<p>That's even more evident in terms of lyrics, where Japandroids have gone from having almost none at all to packing their songs with an astonishing command of legend and literalism that all but dares you to feel <i>something.</i> Everything burns brighter than it does in reality here (""sexual red"" is their color of choice) and most human interactions are likened to explosions. What's the ""Adrenaline Nightshift""? It's a ""generation's bonfire,"" the affection of a girl with ""a blitzkrieg love and a Roman candle kiss."" Still unsure? How about ""there's no high like this."" I can't intelligently describe ""hearts from hell"" or why they ""collide on fire highway's tonight"" but I don't have to. ""We dreamed it now we know,"" King belts and if you don't know, just wait for the guitar solo which doesn't play notes so much as release a blue streak of endorphins. Now you know.</p>
<p>While <i>Celebration Rock </i>is undoubtedly a fun record, it earns its spot amongst their heroes by<i> </i>discovering its emotional ballast during the near-perfect Side B. ""Adrenaline Nightshift"" and ""Younger Us"" are psychologically complex songs about simple pleasures of music and companionship that generate the momentum required for <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13363-the-house-that-heaven-built/"" target=""_blank"">""The House That Heaven Built""</a>, the crest of <i>Celebration Rock's </i>rising action and the pinnacle of their songwriting. Over its five minutes, ""House"" grows increasingly heavy without any adding any superficial layers, Prowse's militant drum beat multiplying into tense fills, King's single guitar chord doubling over itself and a near telepathic vocal interplay delivering maybe the most inspiring of <i>Celebration Rock's </i>life-affirming<i> </i>credos<i>:</i> ""When they love you and they will/ (<i>And they will!</i>)/ I'll tell 'em all they'll love in my shadow."" Whether it's an unappreciative boss, an unfeeling lover, or just a hometown you've outgrown, Japandroids got your back. Throughout ""The House That Heaven Built"", you hear a band accumulating enough confidence to deliver the valedictory message of an album where 95% of the lyrics are immediately available for a senior yearbook quote: ""It's a lifeless life with no fixed address to give/ But you're not mine to die for anymore/ <i>So </i><i>I must live</i>.""</p>
<p>This leads into the relatively restrained ""Continuous Thunder"", the one song here I'm really tempted to misread so as to apply it to Japandroids themselves. There's a devastating admission in the bridge that bookends the intro from ""The Nights of Wine and Roses"" (""If I had all of the answers/ And you had the body you wanted/ Would we love with a legendary fire?""), and the opening line, ""The heart's terrain is never a prairie/ But you weren't wary/ You took my hand,"" is obviously addressed to a hesitant partner. But it plays to the overarching theme of being fearless in the face of doubt. <i>Of course</i> Japandroids couldn't act with the same urgency they did on <i>Post-Nothing</i>-- they're not in the same desperate situation, and they boldly manifest the confidence of having survived <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8847-japandroids/"" target=""_blank"">near-death experiences as human beings</a> and as a band.</p>
<p><i></i>It'd be nice to think that <i>Post-Nothing </i>was inevitably too good to be ignored, but as a very untrendy band in a city with little support for live music, the odds were stacked against them. One lame show in front of the wrong crowd, the wrong choice of a single falling on the wrong set of ears, and that could've been it, just as they planned it. And yet, they went ahead anyway and soon found themselves playing to rooms full of people who don't have the answers, don't have the body they want, and have plenty of dreams that may never come true. But so what? Whether it's a result of faith in religion, in rock'n'roll, or another human being, two completely normal people <i>can </i>love each other with a legendary fire and it's no more ridiculous than two dudes pushing 30 years old from Vancouver called <i>Japandroids</i> making a rock record for the ages. You can be ambivalent about yourself but believe in something bigger, and the message is right there in the title: On <i>Post-Nothing, </i>Japandroids were worried about dying. This is a celebration of being alive. </p></div>"|16564.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16564-japandroids-celebration-rock/|8.8|Ian Cohen

The sheer, relentless force of that release seemingly had a physically and emotionally draining effect on the Brooklyn-via-San Francisco trio; when I caught the band at a March 2009 South by Southwest showcase, they had already forsaken their debut's percussive thrust for the more gentle, deconstructed tropical-pop sound that would surface on 2010's stopgap <i>Pure Moods</i> EP. But on their sophomore full-length, <i>Diver</i>, Lemonade effectively pull an all-out George Costanza: They strive to become <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Opposite"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the exact opposite of everything they once were</a>.</p>
<p>Where Lemonade once routinely stretched their aggro-house workouts past the seven-minute mark, <i>Diver</i> works in more pop-economical four-minute bursts, tempering the big-beat ballast into stripped-down slow jams. Where the band once exuded all the sweat and humidity of a fire-code-violating loft party, the mood of <i>Diver</i> is deliberately austere and chilly, all frost-covered synths and ice-picked broken beats. And where frontman Callan Clendenin once favored an unintelligible shout-speak that perfectly personified the band's hedonistic verve, on <i>Diver</i>, he sensitively sings about his feelings and desires in no uncertain terms.</p>
<p>Clendenin has certainly come a long way as a vocalist since his initial, tentative forays into pop on <i>Pure Moods</i>; now pitched somewhere between the arena-sized ardor of Cut Copy's Dan Whitford and the hermetic croon of Junior Boys' Jeremy Greenspan, Clendenin convincingly projects the inner turmoil and insecurities of someone who's endured many sleepless nights with too much on his mind. But that constant sense of yearning turns <i>Diver</i> into an exceedingly serious, earnest affair that conjures copious visions of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctwqa3QCwMw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">highly stylized black-and-white videos from the mid-80s featuring singers staring ruefully into the camera</a>. And while Lemonade's production palette is broad enough to draw from the Ibiza-bound synth-pop of New Order (""Ice Water"") and twitchy R&amp;B (""Eye Drops""), it's overly reliant on some of the more odious, oil-slick signifiers of Reagan-era MOR: New Agey keyboard lines (""Infinite Style""), steel-pan-drum accents (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13290-neptune/"" target=""_blank"">""Neptune""</a>, ""Whitecaps"") and wind-chime vibes (""Vivid""). Appropriately, even the album title sounds like it was pinched from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_of_a_Diver"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a mid-period Steve Winwood record</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these over-glossed Lite-FM touches make some of Clendenin's open-hearted addresses (""when you pocket-/ called me/ from some/ party/ there were/ so many/ <i>voices in that room!</i>"") sound much more melodramatic-- if not outright cheesy-- than they ought to be. And yet, <i>Diver</i>'s surface sheen doesn't obscure the fact that Lemonade have improved greatly as songwriters, with a far more assured grasp of melody and pop structure than their debut album ever suggested. All of the aforementioned songs are fundamentally strong enough to make you wonder how much better they'd be if Lemonade downplayed the preciousness and amplified the sense of urgency and release; <i>Diver</i>'s last two and, not coincidentally, best tracks-- ""Big Changes"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13632-softkiss/"" target=""_blank"">""Softkiss""</a>-- put that theory into immediate action, translating Lemonade's sophisticating songcraft into strobe-lit dancefloor anthems. True to its titular subject, <i>Diver</i> constitutes a daring leap for Lemonade, one that, at times, appears destined to result in a belly-flop, but recovers nicely in the end.</p></div>"|16663.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16663-diver/|6.8|Stuart Berman

But no. <i>Magic Hour</i> is, in fact, the group's most low-key and ballad-centric album to date, with only a few cuts that approach the hyperactive, ultra-camp thrills of songs like ""Filthy/Gorgeous"", ""Paul McCartney"", and ""Invisible Light"".</p>
<p>It's a little unclear why the group drafted so many ringers to help write this record. Though the Calvin Harris-produced dance ballad ""Only the Horses"" retains some of the producer's delightfully cheesy house aesthetics, the other guest producers have dialed back their quirks considerably. This is disappointing. While the band's previous songwriting collaborations with Elton John and David Bowie sideman Carlos Alomar yielded tunes that fused those artists' immediately recognizable styles with the Sisters' distinct brand of 1970s pop pastiche, their collaborators end up getting swallowed by the band's well-defined style. It's hard to tell what Diplo brought to the moody, subdued ""Year of Living Dangerously"", and there is only a trace of the Neptune's signature sound in ""Inevitable"", a track that sounds like it ought to be playing faintly in the background of an overly fancy cocktail lounge.</p>
<p>While it is certainly admirable that the Scissor Sisters' creative vision is strong enough that they sound very much like themselves no matter who they work with, they really could have used a strong push from their collaborators this time around. Primary songwriters Jake Shears and Babydaddy are still very good with melody, but even the best material on <i>Magic Hour-- </i>the jaunty opener ""Baby Come Home"", the delightful club track ""Keep Your Shoes On""-- lack the spark and exuberance of their earlier work.</p>
<p>The abundance of ballads doesn't help. Though Shears is quite good at singing them, they have never been the band's strong suit, and they seem to be aware of this, as those numbers never seem to stick around for long in their live show. The group always seem self conscious on their ballads, with Shears singing as though on his best behavior, and the band leaning on too-obvious reference points. The slow songs here aren't all a bust-- ""Year of Living Dangerously"" builds to a satisfyingly melodramatic peak and ""Inevitable"" has an appealing glamor. But the duds are very difficult to sit through, particularly the bland ""Secret Life of Letters"" and the trite, excessively sentimental ""Best in Me"".</p>
<p><i>Magic Hour</i> is more effective on a thematic level. Shears has spent the past decade tweaking the familiar sentiment and sound of classic pop to reflect the specific dynamics, quirks, kinks, and rites of passage of queer culture. He focuses on the issue of fidelity in this set, with several songs tackling the emotional complications of what Dan Savage calls a ""<a href=""http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=11412386"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">monogamish</a>"" relationship. ""Baby Come Home"" nails this right off the bat, as Shears sings from the perspective of a man who is just fine with his partner getting action all night long, but is anxious to get him back in his arms. The music is bright and perky, letting on both a happy acceptance of his partner's freedom as well as the impatience of his desire. It's the most inspired cut on the record, and also the one that feels the most familiar. This is exactly the sort of song that comes most naturally to Shears and Babydaddy, and its presence among stodgy, over-written mid-tempo cuts and awkward stabs at hip-hop like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/44964-video-scissor-sisters-team-up-with-azealia-banks-for-shady-love/"" target=""_blank"">Azealia Banks collab ""Shady Love""</a> hangs a lantern on the notion that maybe this time around the band spent too much of its time overthinking the material and denying its best instincts.</p></div>"|16666.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16666-magic-hour/|5.3|Matthew Perpetua

Seth Bogart, better known as Hunx, <a href=""http://larecord.com/interviews/2012/03/20/hunx-sir-you-have-to-leave"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cites him as his best friend</a>. He was the frontman of stoner-metal outfit Witch, but wasn't the band's best-known member. (That honor goes to the band's drummer and all-around indie-rock hero J Mascis.) He was a part of sprawling Vermont hippie collective Feathers back when you could use the term ""freak-folk"" without feeling embarrassed for yourself. But to a specific portion of the rock-nerd underworld, Thomas is foremost known as <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/kingtuff"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">King Tuff</a>, Playground Legend (at least among those who proudly flaunt 3"" Burger Records badges on their jean jackets). If that name doesn't ring a bell, here's a quick briefing: His charisma is magnetic, his shows are akin to cheap-beer-soaked tent revivals, he combines the stadium-sized guitar licks of Erik Cartwright with the bratty whine of Eric Cartman, and his solo debut, 2008's <i>Was Dead</i>, was the sort of album most scuzz-loving musicians would incinerate their garages to make. </p>
<p>Though long on distortion and short on subtlety, it would be a stretch to dump <i>Was Dead</i> in the ""lo-fi"" category. Though Thomas worked on the album completely by himself, it was better-produced (or, if you prefer, recorded less crappily) than modern dirtbag-punk classics like Jay Reatard's <i>Blood Visions</i> and Ty Segall's <i>Melted</i>. It was a record packed to the brim with energy and irresistible hooks, with its best moments (""A Pretty Dress"", ""Just Strut"", ""Animal"") going a long way to prove why the enthusiasm toward Thomas' solo project is well justified. If you were expecting King Tuff's self-titled sophomore album to be <i>Was Dead 2: The Resurrection</i>, don't hold your breath. This is both a good and bad thing.</p>
<p>Irreverence is paramount to being in a garage-rock band (unless you're, say, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26456-women/"" target=""_blank"">Women</a>, there are few things more boring than a garage band that takes themselves too seriously), and Thomas has this in spades. In ""Keep on Movin'"", he shouts out arcane dance moves and, in his own words, lets his guitar (whose name is Jazijoo) drool. He lets out a comically puny bark in ""Stranger"". He gives his songs titles like ""Loser's Wall"" and ""Swamp of Love"", which sound like landmarks where misfits in the Deep South meet to make out. The <a href=""http://assets4.subpop.com/assets/images/main/11616.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">album art</a> bears the image of a cartoon bat holding a Gibson guitar and a magic wand. Clichés frowning upon judging a book by its cover need not apply here.</p>
<p><i>King Tuff</i>'s aforementioned cover looks exactly like the kind of decal someone would slap on the bumper of their beaten-to-shit 1976 Camaro, and for the most part, the music sounds perfect for playing inside such a vehicle while attempting to see if it can still hit 80mph. There's the too-appropriately-titled opener ""Anthem"", carried by a double-neck lead begging to be greeted with devil horn gestures. There's the Lynyrd Skynyrd-esque boogie of ""Stranger"", the freewheeling and fun ""Baby Just Break"", and climactic closer ""Hit &amp; Run"". Album highlight <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13275-bad-things/"" target=""_blank"">""Bad Thing""</a> is Hunx's <i>Hairdresser Blues</i> spiked with brown liquor, equipped with a supercharged chorus. Completely free of arty abstraction, the good parts of <i>King Tuff</i> were designed with maximum impact in mind.</p>
<p>Unlike most of his contemporaries, Thomas' chief value as a songwriter is his accessibility. While most of his top-shelf contemporaries have wandered out of dive-bar stardom and into the world of indie rock-at-large, they have also drawn a clear line in the sand between themselves and fans who may not be receptive to their sound. Thomas, on the other hand, has no problem meeting those fans in the middle.</p>
<p>At times, this creates problems for the album. Tunes like ""Unusual World"" and ""Evergreen"" sound like quieter holdovers from Thomas' 2010 album under the name Happy Birthday, and sound out of place here. Both songs provide breathing room between the album's stompers, but perhaps a bit too much breathing room, to the point where they feel like filler. ""Loser's Wall"" and ""Keep on Movin'"" drift at midtempo, leaving you with the feeling that Thomas has written these songs before, only faster and better. One of the many great things about <i>Was Dead</i> was its near-relentless pacing, making it a breeze to listen to over and over again. <i>King Tuff</i> feels like the couch surfer friend you invite to your house party, the one who's often charming and fun but will not leave until every last drop of beer is gone.</p>
<p>For all his mishaps in attempting to broaden his style, the gambit Thomas takes on ""Swamp of Love"" is the one that pays off. A wistful piano ballad at its core, the song wildly benefits from Thomas' romantic croon and the climax that bookends it. It's actually kind of difficult to imagine this as the kind of song King Tuff had in him. Through all the hits and misses artists go through while expanding their songwriting breadth, surprises this satisfying are why artists step out of their comfort zone in the first place. Even though it's nowhere near as consistently great as <i>Was Dead</i>, it's nice to witness a songwriter like Kyle Thomas treading unfamiliar territory instead of delivering more of the same. It gives hope that his next great album won't sound like his last great album.</p></div>"|16667.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16667-king-tuff/|7.8|Martin Douglas

Mahood is joined on Spirits by two other humans: Edibles' Dusty Dybvig, who sneaks a bit of hand drum onto <i>Spirits</i>' title track, and Mahood's young daughter, Harper, on the shaker. A sense of retreat echoes throughout <i>Spirits</i>, but it's not the lonesome kind; rather, <i>Spirits</i> feels like the kind of patient, deliberate work you know you have to get away from everything to get right. Plankton Wat's music, all earthy drones, knotty acoustic fingerpicking and swirling psychedelic wanderings, creates a kind of seclusion in sound, a place far removed from the mess and noise of the modern world.</p>
<p>Mahood's been making music as Plankton Wat for a decade now, much of it small-batch cassette and CD releases. The all-instrumental <i>Spirits</i> proves both a coalescing and a continuation of his formidable back catalog: Everything here clocks in under 10 minutes, and though Mahood has let his songs wander further afield in the past, he's never had a record that felt so deliberately of a piece from start to finish. <i>Spirits</i>' balance of earthbound textures and spectral meanderings is the result of some careful craftsmanship on Mahood's part; it's easily his warmest, most approachable record, but beneath its dusty underbelly and swaths of distortion, there's at least an echo of everything he's ever done here. His acoustic playing is stately but never showy, wonderfully unhurried; on electric, Mahood steadily pushes things starward, with an intensity of focus that goes far beyond mere noodling. <i>Spirits</i> is, at times, the kind of trickling wood-and-water music you'd expect to hear at your friendly neighborhood incense peddlers, but even its moments of more straight-up, pastoral prettiness have the adventurous, open-armed spirit of anything on your local tape label.</p>
<p>Mahood has claimed inspiration for <i>Spirits</i> and his other work from free-jazz icons like Don Cherry, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5881-alice-coltrane/"" target=""_blank"">Alice Coltrane</a>, and others, musicians who gave little mind to genre boundaries and formal conventions in order to seek some pure truth. That was, of course, the late 1960s, back when that kind of talk didn't inspire quite so much blushing outside of Erowid, but Mahood's music-- though it's rooted in folk, not jazz-- does seem right in line with that lineage and its aim of transcendending the self. <i>Spirits</i>' meditative, solitudinous beauty reflects the kind of serious thought you can only do under the influence of heavy-duty chemicals or-- more likely, in Mahood's case-- when you find yourself miles from the nearest human. The time-slowing, pulse-quelling <i>Spirits</i> is a good place to get some thinking done.</p></div>"|16672.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16672-spirits/|7.3|Paul Thompson

This is the first thing Hamilton Leithauser sighs on <a href=""http://www.thewalkmen.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Walkmen</a>'s new album, <i>Heaven</i>. It is a distinctly un-rock'n'roll sentiment. In fact, it sounds like the sort of thing your grandpa might say. Ten years ago, the Walkmen were a magnetic, messy young rock band, and they did all the things we expect young rock bands to do: swung in unexpectedly on friends, drunk-dialed exes, pleaded pathetically that things would get better with zero evidence that they would. But over the course of their last two albums, they began receding gracefully into sepia tone: Both <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12084-you-me/"" target=""_blank""><i>You &amp; Me</i></a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14605-lisbon/"" target=""_blank""><i>Lisbon</i></a> felt like more breezy postcards from abroad than seething dispatches from here. <i>Heaven</i>, their gloriously pretty sixth studio record, marks the moment they shuffle off into that 4x6-sized sunset forever. The title they've chosen says it all: Look where they ended up! We all know that's not where rock bands go.</p>
<p><i>Heaven</i>, as Talking Heads famously defined it, ""is a place where nothing ever happens."" For most sentient people, that sounds like the definition of hell, which Byrne's lyrics admitted: ""It's hard to imagine how nothing at all/ Could be so exciting/ Could be so much fun."" Similarly, it might not thrill longtime Walkmen fans to picture the band as a bunch of rumpled, beaming dads slotting recording time in between play dates. But on <i>Heaven</i>, they've made a bewildered, giddy paean to their own happiness. <i>Heaven</i> feels infectiously drunk on its own good fortune and kicks out a barstool for you to drink alongside it.</p>
<p>It helps that Hamilton Leithauser, with his oddly aristocratic presence, remains a magnetic frontman even when he's basically taking a song to make goo-goo noises at his one-year-old daughter (the lovely if borderline-saccharine ""Song for Leigh""). There was always something airily entitled in Leithauser's on-record persona; he was the rich kid who didn't have to do his homework, because he knew you'd do it if he asked. That this kid had feelings too was a fundamental dramatic premise of the Walkmen. To hear this former kid now ruminating on big-picture stuff, like the statistical improbability of lasting love (""Love Is Luck"") or the emptiness of perfection (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13576-we-cant-be-beat/"" target=""_blank"">""We Can't Be Beat""</a>) is to hear the band's purview expand quietly. On ""Southern Heart"", he even plays a pleasantly tired cuckold, like the Leonard Cohen of ""Famous Blue Raincoat"": ""Tell me again how you loved all the men you were after,"" he mutters.</p>
<p>Some longtime fans might not like their Walkmen like this. They were great, after all, at being sexily unstable. But this retro-yearning tendency has been there since the beginning if you looked for it. So to hear them ease out of sturm-und-drang and into something resembling durable adulthood is to witness a great rock band evolve along a logical path. In what may be a tacit acknowledgement of this shift, <i>Heaven</i> glows with nostalgic pre-rock'n'roll sounds: ""Jerry Jr.'s Tune"" is one-and-a-half moonlit minutes of classic doo-wop; ""No One Ever Sleeps"" has a faint mariachi-sounding horn section; ""Love Is Luck"" is a sparkling calypso song. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13525-heartbreaker/"" target=""_blank"">""Heartbreaker""</a> echoes the chords, melody <i>and</i> rhythm of ""Be My Baby"".</p>
<p>All of the Walkmen's albums have been recorded with meticulous, stone-cutting care; by now, listening to them is like entering a room where you can tap your foot in corners to test its resonance. ""We Can't Be Beat"", one of a few songs on <i>Heaven</i> rounded out with harmonies from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5653-fleet-foxes/"" target=""_blank"">Fleet Foxes</a>' Robin Pecknold, eases into a full-band march after about two minutes of wry, twinkling acoustic guitar. On ""Line By Line"", Leithauser croons tenderly over a single rippling guitar until a string section gradually soaks in at the song's edges. The beery, cock-eyed ""No One Ever Sleeps"" transforms the Walkmen into a schmaltzy gypsy band serenading the outdoor tables at a white-tablecloth restaurant.</p>
<p>This group has always been able to carve out dramatic gestures like this, and even at this end of the spectrum-- far beyond personal explosions and exclamation-pointed delivery-- they continue to craft music of wry vitality. It may be that they can no longer convincingly deliver tortured, existential desperation, and if so, that's just as well. With <i>Heaven</i>, they've turned out a record that finds a thousand affecting variations on contented hum.</p></div>"|16635.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16635-the-walkmen-heaven/|8.1|Jayson Greene

I say all of this because the corporate-slick production on <a href=""http://futureoftheleft.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Future of the Left</a>'s third album makes me wonder if this is still the guy who made the music of ""To Hell With Good Intentions"" and ""You Need Satan More Than He Needs You"" as sharp as their wit. And what about the cover and the goddamn title of <i>The Plot Against Common Sense?</i> What in god's name is the author of ""Fuck This Band"" doing stealing ideas from unpublished John Stossel books?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As it turns out, those fears aren't fully realized on <i>The Plot Against Common Sense</i>, though they are definitely warranted. Little has changed musically for the always-contradictory Future of the Left. The constituent parts are primitively composed but played with vice-tight musicianship, while the blindingly bright, major-key synth riffs still come off as abrasive as anything produced by an atonal noise band. In terms of tempo and texture, <i>The Plot </i>hangs a little bit more loosely than the trim <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13115-travels-with-myself-and-another/"" target=""_blank"">Travels With Myself and Another</a>,</i> with ""Goals in Slow Motion"" inching toward a legit alt-rock chorus and the jaw harp-like sample of ""Anchor"" raising the possibility that they're secretly fans of ""A Milli"". But even if the mockup of punk commodification on ""Sheena Is a T-Shirt Salesman"" is more entry-level (""dumb is the new black,"" <i>ugh</i>) than the aforementioned ""pop"" maneuvers, the music itself rips hard. And it's still so rare to hear a band this caustic and aggressive that manages to be so intelligible. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But the sound is still there to support Falkous' hectoring. This is usually a good thing-- no one else is coming up with lines like ""I have seen into the future/ Everyone is slightly older"" and ""Civilized people don't fuck bears/ Civilized people don't play fair"" that function as good jokes<i> and</i> good hooks. It can make Future of the Left seem damn near necessary at times. After all, humor is often seen as coming from a less authentic place than anger, heartbreak, or joy, and most bands who try to be funny often make it a point to counterbalance it with an equal and oppositely sensitive show of humanity. Not these guys; an emotionally complex song on <i>The Plot Against Common Sense </i>happens to be both cynical <i>and </i>sarcastic. When it works, it opens up an almost unlimited world of songwriting possibilities.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But while Falkous has long been adept at connecting with an audience via snark, man, do things take a wicked, face-shielding turn about halfway through <i>Common Sense. </i>For the most part, you just wish Falkous would pick on someone his own size. Shit like plastic surgery (""Polymers Are Forever"", held over from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16025-polymers-are-forever/"" target=""_blank"">2011's EP</a>), Trustafarians (""Sorry Dad, I Was Late For the Riots"") and Alcoholics Anonymous (""Anchor"") make for unfair fights, and Falkous can only barely muster the effort. And I'm not sure we needed <i>another </i>Future of the Left song exploring the politics of pagan orgies (""A Guide to Men"").<i> </i></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i></i>But the point of no return is clearly ""Robocop 4-- Fuck Off Robocop"". Look, <i>Battleship: The Movie </i>is in theaters and we clearly need a ""Burn Hollywood Burn"" to reflect the times<i>.</i> But I can say with a fair degree of certainty that 2012 will not see a more stupendously awesome song title or a worse song attached to it. Why it's even a song to begin with is beyond me, as its musical values are pretty much nil. And then Falkous half-raps the following: ""George Lucas won't be kicking his heels 'til he makes some money from <i>Howard the Duck.</i>"" That's the part I chose to quote at length, when a line about Billy Corgan starring as a <i>Harry Potter </i>villain was readily available. Let that sink in.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It's a shame that Falkous is playing to the cheap seats on <i>The Plot Against Common Sense</i>, since, to paraphrase one of their best songs, we need Falkous more than he needs us. But I suppose if any teen comes for the ""Diff'rent Strokes"" and Russell Brand jokes and finds his way toward <i>Travels With Myself and Another </i>and <i>Do Dallas</i>, I can't deny him any more than I could my teenage self that bought overproduced and hamfisted Bad Religion records like <i>The Gray Race </i>and <i>Stranger Than Fiction </i>and thought they were the shit because of all the big words. But I also thought guys like Lewis Black and David Cross were the shit at the time too, and by a certain point, either due to laziness or just a tremendous misunderstanding of their talents, they ditched any semblance of cleverness or comedy for straight-up ranting. It's hard to watch. I'm hoping Falkous doesn't go there, but on <i>The Plot Against Common Sense</i>,<i> </i>he's threatening to become the kind of willfully delusional lunkhead that Mclusky songs eviscerated.  </p>

But instead of an intriguing side project from an obviously talented producer (in addition to the Weeknd, Illangelo had a hand in Drake's ""Crew Love""), the EP turns out to be a disappointing facsimile of his more famous projects. <i>Alien Tentacle Sex</i> basically feels like Illangelo twiddling his thumbs nervously while he waits for the Weeknd tour to finish.</p>
<p>The record starts strong with a lush production job in ""I'd Die"", musically as strong as anything on the Weeknd's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16134-echoes-of-silence/"" target=""_blank"">Echoes of Silence</a>.</i> The slinking metallic beat is embellished with groaning synths, eerie chimes, and all manner of weird samples. But then the vocal comes in. There's something about <a href=""http://www.talwst.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TALWST</a>'s cadences that sound <i>too</i> close to a sandpaper-throated Tesfaye, and the heavy processing that replicates the headier moments of the Weeknd catalog doesn't help the case. The unwise similarity is further explored on ""Mercy Me"", a nonsense mope-glam number that sounds like it was based off a discarded Tesfaye guide vocal. These comparisons may be unfair, but there's just no escaping them here. </p>
<p>TALWST doesn't have the most distinctive or powerful voice, but that shouldn't be enough to dismiss him wholesale-- plenty have done great with much less. Unfortunately, his lyrics are far, far worse: Gems like ""passport inked like Lil Wayne's face"" are outdone by the mid-album wading pool ""Lonely Guy"", an unbearably self-pitying track where his reedy warble actually manages to croon the phrase ""Lonely guy/ He is I."" TALWST's self-analyzation feels like empty narcissism, backed up by a completely unconvincing persona.</p>
<p><i>Alien Tentacle Sex </i>isn't all Weeknd rip-offs. ""Woman"" chops up spoken-word and gasps of melody into an alien assemblage that <i>sounds</i> neat even if the lyrical content is embarrassing, while the brief ""Peace Tonight"" is easily the highlight. It's just too bad his gruff rap is interrupted by cries of ""please no nuclear bombs."" The only thing worse than the unnecessary politicization is his flagrant mispronunciation of ""nuclear."" The melodramatic closer ""No Stones"" seems to want to recreate the subtle magic of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13160-climax/"" target=""_blank"">Usher's ""Climax""</a>, from the honeyed tones to the gently elongated phrasing, but it lacks even a modicum of subtlety, its ham-shaped fist too salty for even the most naive of palettes.</p>
<p>R&amp;B is largely personality-driven stuff, and outside of what he misguidedly tries to borrow from more established artists, TALWST has very little to sell. Having come so far so fast, Illangelo's name now carries some serious weight, but even that proven pedigree isn't enough to build a fortress out of toothpicks. Whatever the intent was with <i>Alien Tentacle Sex </i>(even the title hints at an intriguing dimension unexplored by the pedestrian music), it seems like they lost the plot at some point along the way.</p></div>"|16645.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16645-alien-tentacle/|4.0|Andrew Ryce

Sometimes referred to as ""bitstep,"" there was a handful of producers-- including early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22489-zomby/"" target=""_blank"">Zomby</a> and Philadelphia's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22491-starkey/"" target=""_blank"">Starkey</a> (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLmOCqoUjuE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an example</a>), even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28425-james-blake/"" target=""_blank"">James Blake</a>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDb-9bNRW_Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">outré moments</a>-- that were constructing bold, mechanistic dub-funk. <a href=""http://slugabed.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Slugabed</a>'s <i>Ultra Heat Treated</i> EP was one of the ripest examples of this style, which, in drawing from dubstep, American hip-hop, grime, and hard techno, offered a more robust sound palette than most anything else being released. If Detroit techno was, as Derrick May famously said, George Clinton and Kraftwerk stuck in an elevator, this was Dr. Dre pumping out of Optimus Prime's speakers. To quote the title of a track from Slugabed's <i>Time Team</i>: ""It's When the Future Falls Plop on Your Head"". </p>
<p>The shame is that neither that track-- which closes <i>Time Team</i> on a slight note-- nor the rest of Slugabed's debut long-player sounds much like the future at all. Since <i>Ultra Heat Treated</i>, Slugabed has released two EPs of increasingly glossy synth turbulence, refining his sound by sanding off the edges that made it-- and anything that came into contact with-- bleed. Slugabed can thank London's recent fascination with house music for the fact that he has rarely sounded further askew from his particular generation of bass producers. <i>Time Team</i> has as much in common with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23840-scuba/"" target=""_blank"">Scuba</a> as it does <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30169-skrillex/"" target=""_blank"">Skrillex</a>, which is to say very little (though Sluga's bold, manic productions are a purer interpretation of Aphex Twin's legacy than Skrillex's widely praised ""I also like melody""-devotion). </p>
<p>His default mode now is a slow, saccharine boogie-- dubstep filtered through a g-funk lean-- that still relies on his alien sound palette. He favors call-and-response synth figures, overseeing cat-and-mouse games between timorous whistles and black-rubber bass. Rhythms that used to forcefully contort his melodies are more cooperative now; the busy latter half of ""Dragon Drums"" is an afternoon shower compared to the gale-force storms he used to summon, but he's never so inattentive as to let his drums fall into gridlocked kicks or lazy boom-bap. </p>
<p>There's still a sense of discovery, now paired with playfulness. Sluga's vocal samples aren't ashen divas but wishful, chiming children, like he's borrowed <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"" target=""_blank"">Boards of Canada</a>'s pastoral naivety but transposed their nostalgia into sci-fi galavanting. On the mid-album ""Mountains Come Out of the Sky"" and ""Grandma Paints Nice"" he offers faraway vistas, the likes of which you might find on a fantasy novel's cover: the sky is purple, there are a half-dozen visible moons, endless possibilities presented in comfortable, familiar ways. </p>
<p>But looking out at eight moons would be really beautiful, so I can lose myself in the tasteful aphorisms of ""Unicorn Suplex"" and ""Climbing a Tree""'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/425-the-books/"" target=""_blank"">Books</a>-y niceties. I wish Slugabed dropped the hammer more often on <i>Time Team</i>, but sometimes the future plops on your head when you wish it would bash it in.</p></div>"|16665.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16665-time-team/|6.8|Andrew Gaerig

Some claimed influences for the album are marble, trenchcoats, and ""oily black Jeep windows."" These are opaque things, hard things, things that reflect and conceal. The music isn't much different. Latham's previous releases for the Night Slugs label-- two EPs and the one-off ""Arpjam""-- were flat, glaring, and high-tech. <i>Classical Curves</i> isn't much different, only more distilled. Some electronic musicians strive to make their sound as humanistic as possible; <i>Classical Curves</i> is basically disinfectant set to a beat. It borrows its jazz chords from artists like Prince and the 1980s electro-soul group Zapp-- artists who found glamor in the cleanliness of machines. It's an album of bangers, though less in the vernacular sense than in the sense that it often sounds like stuff banging together.</p>
<p>About a minute into the album's intro, we hear the sound of breaking glass. Then more glass. Then a little more. Then, as it transitions into ""Her"", a drum machine that sounds like a jackhammer and a flurry of camera shutters. ""The Courts""-- a single Latham released in advance of the album-- is built on a web of what sounds like new sneakers being streaked across freshly waxed wood. Later on, dogs bark over some more broken glass. In all likelihood you'll know whether this album will repulse you within about two minutes. There's a good chance it may. Latham's single-mindedness, though, is a rare and admirable quality-- a quality that makes <i>Classical Curves</i> sound more like one long, continuous idea than a series of discrete tracks.</p>
<p>As with all Night Slugs' best releases, <i>Classical Curves</i> creates a world that belongs to the music-- a visual world, a world of ideas. The album's cover is a slick little motorbike lying on its side in a marble atrium in front of a huge fern, with a silky yellow piece of fabric draped over a wall behind the bike. It's a seductive image, an image of perfect objects in an imperfect, disarrayed scene. During a recent email exchange, Latham didn't share with me exactly where the shot-- <a href=""http://nightslugs.net/glide/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">or some accompanying videos</a>-- were taken, but he mentioned that a year ago he worked for a company ""stealing and selling information about their rivals,"" a job that forced him to spend a lot of time hanging out in similar kinds of lobbies, spaces he calls ""glamorous looking in a kind of... corporate, rich-people way, I suppose... but pretty lonely and alienating and not the safest career option."" At another point in his career, he produced chrome prostheses for fashion shows. One track here is called ""How We Relate to the Body."" Latham's answer, I imagine, is ""with ambivalence and heavy machinery.""</p>
<p>Beauty, bodies, science fiction, ideas of cleanliness and perfection-- it's all suggested here in sound. In a lot of ways, this album is more conceptually in touch with prime-era Kraftwerk or, as previously mentioned, early industrial music: music that highlights its own sense of soul by being as comprehensively soulless as possible. This is music that achieves as much of its effect through silence as through sound: Between every beat, the space is so absolute and empty that getting to the next piece of solid ground is a kind of perpetual thrill. Not a warm one, not a nice one, just a perpetual one, one that mechanically follows the one before it, no variation, no room for error.</p></div>"|16768.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16768-classical-curves/|7.3|Mike Powell

This is odd. Usually the reissue-packaging gods demand the positioning of an eager critic between you and the product, dispensing wisdom on how you might experience the music they're standing in front of. What you find instead is a McCartney family-photo scrapbook: Paul draping himself playfully around monkey bars with his infant Stella. Mary, about three years old, hoisting fat headphones above her tiny head; on the opposite page, Linda nuzzling Paul, those same headphones ringed around his neck. In the photos, Paul looks dazed, as if he were smacked in the face with a pillow seconds before the shutter clicked. It drives the point home: <i>Ram</i> is a domestic-bliss album, one of the weirdest, earthiest, and most honest ever made. No wonder critics loathed it so passionately.</p>
<p>Or at least, some critics did. Sometimes an album gets a review so resoundingly negative that it lurks forever like a mournful spirit in its rear view mirror: Jon Landau, writing for <i>Rolling Stone</i>, claimed to hear in <i>Ram</i> ""the nadir in the decomposition of Sixties rock thus far."" Which is intense. But people wanted impossible things from Beatles solo albums-- closure, healing, apologies, explanations for what to do with their dashed expectations. John Lennon tried telling everyone outright ""The dream is over"" on Plastic Ono Band's ""God"", but that still wasn't a cold-water jet hard enough to prepare people, apparently, for the whimsical pastoral oddity that was <i>Ram</i>.</p>
<p>Landau was right, however, that it did spell the end of something, which might be a clue to the vitriol: If ""60s rock"" was defined, in large part, by the existence of the Beatles, then <i>Ram</i> made it clear in a new, and newly painful, way that there would be no Beatles ever again. To use a messy-divorce metaphor: When your parents are still screaming red-faced at each other, it's a nightmare, but you can still be assured they care. When one of them picks up and continues on living, it smarts in an entirely different way.</p>
<p><i>Ram</i>, simply put, is the first Paul McCartney release completely devoid of John's musical influence. Of course, John wiggled his way into some of the album's lyrics-- in those fresh, post-breakup years, the two couldn't quite keep each other out of their music. But musically, <i>Ram</i> proposes an alternate universe where young Paul skipped church the morning of July 6, 1957, and the two never crossed paths. It's breezy, abstracted, completely hallucinogen-free, and utterly lacking grandiose ambitions. Its an album whistled to itself. It's purely Paul.</p>
<p>Or actually, ""Paul and Linda."" This was another one of Paul's chief <i>Ram</i>-related offenses: He not only invited his new photographer bride into the recording studio, he included her name on the record's spine. <i>Ram</i> is the only album in recorded history credited to the artist duo ""Paul and Linda McCartney,"" and in the sense that Linda's enthusiastically warbling vocals appear on almost every song, it's entirely accurate. Some read Paul's decision as the ultimate insult to his former partner: I've got a <i>new</i> collaborator now! Her name is Linda, and she never makes me feel stupid. In the album's freewheeling spirit, however, the decision scans more like guilelessness and innocence. The songs don't feel collaborative so much as cooperative: little schoolhouse plays that required every hand on deck to get off the ground. Paul had the most talent, so naturally he was up front, but he wanted everyone behind him, banging pots, hollering, whistling-- whatever it is you did, make sure you're back there doing it with gusto.</p>
<p>It is exactly this homemade charm that has caught on with generations of listeners as the initial furor around the album subsided. What 2012's ears can find on <i>Ram</i> is a rock icon inventing an approach to pop music that would eventually become someone else's indie pop. It had no trendy name here; it was just a disappointing Beatles solo album. But when Ben Stiller's fussy, pedantic ""Greenberg"" character painstakingly assembles a mix for Greta Gerwig intended to display the breadth and depth of his pop-culture appreciation, he slides <i>Ram</i>'s ""Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey"" on there. It's the song we see her singing along to enthusiastically in the following montage.</p>
<p>Critics <i>hated</i> ""Uncle Albert"". ""A major annoyance,"" Christgau opined. Again, from the current moment we can only plead ignorance, assume that some serious shit had to be going down to clog everyone's ears. Because ""Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey"" is not only <i>Ram</i>'s centerpiece, it is clearly one of McCartney five greatest solo songs. As the slash in the title hints, it's a multi-part song, starring two characters. To put its accomplishments in an egg-headed way: It fuses the conversational joy listeners associated with McCartney's melodic gift to the compositional ambition everyone assumed was Lennon's. To put it a simpler way: Every single second of this song is joyously, deliriously catchy, and no two seconds are the same. Do you think early Of Montreal, the White Stripes at their most vaudevillian, or the Fiery Furnaces took any lessons from this song?</p>
<p>What a lot of people thought they heard on ""Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey"", and everywhere else on the album, is cloying cuteness. But it turns out you can say a lot of things-- things like ""go fuck yourself"" (""3 Legs""), ""everything is fucked"" (""Too Many People""), and even ""let's go fuck, honey"" (""Eat At Home)""-- with a big, dimpled grin on your face. ""It's just the critics who say, 'Well, John was the biting tongue; Paul's the sentimental one,'"" Linda <a href=""http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1984.pmpb.beatles.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">observed shrewdly in a dual Playboy interview from 1984.</a> ""John was biting, but he was also sentimental. Paul was sentimental, but he could be very biting. They were more similar than they were different.""</p>
<p>The joy of paying close attention to <i>Ram</i> is gradually discovering that Paul was humming darker things under his breath than it seemed. ""Smile Away"", for instance, is a messy, romping slab of Buddy Holly rock. Paul makes a joke about his stinky feet. The chorus goes ""Smile away, smile away, smile away, smile away, smile away."" But it's not just ""smile,"" a brief, cost-free act that can last a second. It's ""Smile Away"", keeping a fixed grin as conversation grows unpleasant. In interviews of the period, Paul was asked repeatedly if he felt lost without his collaborating partner, if he was motivated solely by commercial success, how he felt about being ""the cute Beatle."" The backing vocal chant behind ""Smile Away"" goes, by turns, ""Don't know how to do that"" and ""Learning how to do that."" ""Smile away horribly, now,"" Paul slurs over the song's fadeout. Yes, he's fine. No, he and Linda will not become the next ""John and Yoko."" But thanks so much for asking. If you tell a dog it's a brainless fleabag with the same tone of voice you use to say ""Good boy,"" it will still wag its tail.</p>
<p>The album is riddled with dark grace notes like this: ""Monkberry Moon Delight"" has an absolutely unhinged vocal take, Paul gulping and sobbing right next to your inner ear. The imagery is surrealist, but anything but whimsical: ""When a rattle of rats had awoken/ The sinews, the nerves, and the veins,"" he bellows. It could be a latter-day Tom Waits performance. ""Too Many People"" opens with Paul warbling ""piece of cake,"" but the lyrics themselves wag their finger at societal injustices, former bandmates-- basically everybody. The lyrics to ""3 Legs"" are full of hobbling animals with missing limbs.</p>
<p>The almost-title song ""Ram On"", could serve as the album's redeeming spirit: A haunting, indelible little tune drifts past on ukulele as Paul croons, ""Ram on, give your heart to somebody/ Soon, right away."" The title is a play on his old stage name ""Paul Ramon,"" which makes the song a private little prayer; a mirror image, perhaps, to John Lennon's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLOTD7wrbtQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Hold On""</a>. The song is reprised, late in the record, functioning like a calming breeze. ""I want a horse, I want a sheep/ Want to get me a good night's sleep,"" Paul jauntily sings on ""Heart of the Country"", a city boy's vision of the country if ever there was one, and another clue to the record's mindstate. For Paul, the country isn't just a place where crops grow; it's ""a place where holy people grow."" Now that American cities everywhere are having their Great Pastoral Moment, full of artisans churning goat's-milk yogurt and canning their own jams, <i>Ram</i> feels like particularly ripe fruit.</p>
<p>This reissue comes with a disc of extras from the period, which hardcore McCartney fans will already know well. They are lovely, an extension of the album's mood and world without interrupting it or diluting it. Songs like ""Another Day"" and ""Hey Diddle"" feel like a cracked-open door onto the kind of records Paul could have conceivably gone on making forever. A few years later, he had returned, presumably chastened, to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_on_the_Run"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">crafting over-arching concept records about fictitious bands</a>, the sort of thing he'd gotten a lot of applause for in the past. But the bracingly pure and simple air of <i>Ram</i> has resonated further.</p></div>"|16651.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16651-ram/|9.2|Jayson Greene

What I write about is very personal, and it's almost entirely about depression, vices, suicide, substance abuse."" He goes as far as to ""slur"" his words ""to make it more monotone sounding,"" and therefore indecipherable. In the same discussion, drummer Justin Ennis, who used to play in the New York City trio <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22209-tombs/"" target=""_blank"">Tombs</a>, explains that the band's music is their ""catharsis,"" and shouldn't be looked at as positive or negative: ""To us, it's all feelings at once, good and bad."" Live, Mutilation Rites don't talk to the crowd between songs; instead, they play loudly, and burrow into themselves: ""The volume is part of how we and the listener become immersed in the moment. It's so loud that if you're not feeling us, you will leave the room. Either you want to be there with us or you don't.""</p>
<p>Black metal bands often come with any number of agendas; the above statements help establish this group as one who doesn't. And unlike other black metal groups in their borough, the quartet's approach sticks to the old-school black metal template: They stuff crust, d-beat, and a love of Dissection into their sound, but in a way that doesn't ask to be called ""post"" or ""avant."" They're just very adept at reviving a structure and making it breathe again.</p>
<p>This year, Mutilation Rites released a couple of EPs of earlier material, but <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/8824-the-outsiders/"" target=""_blank""><i>Empyrean</i></a> is their first proper studio album. On it, they forgo ambient intros, ponderous samples, and endless riffing in favor of a tight 35 minutes that manages to feel expansive courtesy of layers of dual guitars, multiple in-song shifts, and an ongoing push and pull. It's a mix of raw black metal, dark doom, and punk that rocks, but that also offers plenty of prettier surprises. Think of late-period Darkthrone vomiting the youthful version of themselves onto the crowd at a filthy DIY space. (Since recording <i>Empyrean</i>, they fittingly added bassist Ryan Jones of noise-rock icons Today Is the Day.) It's stately and epic, but booze-soaked, filthy, and feral. </p>
<p>They're smart songwriters with ears for catchy, compelling guitar parts. The gorgeous opener ""A Season of Grey Rain"" offers angular, spiraling riffs that locate dark beauty amid buzzing tremolo-picks. The galloping start of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13303-realms-of-dementia"" target=""_blank"">""Realms of Dementia"" </a> has a loping rhythm before the song grows angrier, complete with George Paul hocking spit. (He may not consider himself a vocalist, but his maniacal ranting and raving is as essential to what Mutilation Rites do as is their snails-pace mosh parts, dense atmosphere, and d-beat gallop.) They offer plenty of variety without resorting to ""fusion."" The almost 8-minute ""Ancient Bloodoath"" introduces a snails-pace doom vibe. Following the storm of ""Dead Years"", a song that mixes furious blast beats with a stately crawl, the final track ""Broken Axis"" ends the record with two-minutes of incrementally slower doom and drone. It's a proper set-cap, not a curve ball.</p>
<p><i>Empyrean</i>'s cover art is based on one of 19th-century artist Gustave Doré's illustrations for Dante's <i>The Divine Comedy</i>; the image depicts the highest realm of heaven, a ""paradise"" of fire or light. I like that a band digging into vices, drugs, and self-mutilation-- issues of the body-- offer a bright, celestial, otherworldly, spiritual image to depict their music. Throughout this record, it does feel like they're reaching for those sorts of heights musically, even if they're hanging out in the gutter.</p></div>"|16642.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16642-empyrean/|7.7|Brandon Stosuy

The tale of Aleksa Palladino and Devon Church, after all, is more than a good narrative hook; it's a real-life manifestation of the kind of woozy, romantic arch you've either seen in your daydreams, on the silver screen, or in paperbacks filed in the young-adult or classic literature sections. The daughter of a New York opera singer, Palladino met the relatively agrarian Church in the smoking car of a train while backpacking across Canada. They were teenagers. The new friends tried to watch a meteor shower from the train's observation car, failed, and soon bid adieu; Church wrote her letters, bid for her affection, and eventually just moved to New York and in with her. They got married on Mulholland Drive, she found success as an actress, and they since started an interesting indie rock band together. ""As they share a cigarette on the walk to their apartment, they think about their coming week,"" read a 2011 profile for <i>The Stool Pigeon</i>. ""The Emmys, New York Fashion Week, the season premiere of 'Boardwalk Empire'."" Yes, then, sometimes love can be like the movies.</p>
<p>But Palladino and Church's shared past is more than simple star-laced bait; it's essential to the drama and radiance of their music. If their story sounds like one to be written into a movie, the 10 songs on their Secretly Canadian full-length debut, <i>Passage</i>, feel like scores for pictures not yet made. Insurgent, cinematic, and sometimes brilliant, <i>Passage</i> is an emotionally evocative record bearing sharp hooks, driven deep by heavy textures and broad dynamics. Suggesting Berlin and Bowie, Bedhead and Portishead, Exitmusic's third release continues and catalyzes the pair's stepwise progression, which began with their muted, self-released start in 2007 and last year's refined if stylistically cramped four-track re-introduction. Produced at home by Church but mixed and mastered by the phenomenal Nicolas Vernhes, these songs sound incredible, with their tessellated instrumental layers and intricately woven effects. All at once, it's a sudden move from short films and home movies to a proper, feature-length production. For Palladino and Church, this next level works wonders.</p>
<p>True to her classical pedigree, Palladino is an incredibly versatile singer, able to hurtle gracefully from a <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4957-beach-house/"" target=""_blank"">Victoria Legrand</a> whisper at the start of ""The Modern Age"" to a strident command by the time she strangles the tune's final refrain. She sends up smoke during weird waltz ""The Night"" and plumes of grey during the appropriately named ""Storms"". Above the outwardly building patter of ""White Noise"", she shadows the unwavering cool of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27697-zola-jesus/"" target=""_blank"">Zola Jesus</a>; ""The Modern Age"", the album's lone <i>From Silence</i> holdover, sports the steely glint of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3006-the-national/"" target=""_blank"">the National</a>, just remixed for the fading hours between the dance club's and the bed's rest. During the opening title track, they split her sound open, using her wail as an ornate thread in much the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3784-sigur-ros/"" target=""_blank"">Sigur Rós</a> once did with Jónsi Birgisson's croon. On ""The Wanting"", her singing and the treatment the pair give it again mirror Birgisson's alien tone. It becomes the all-encompassing gauze around, above, and beneath a piano-and-bass plod. Both multi-instrumentalists, she and Church weave these vocals into deft thickets of occasionally abrasive electronics, chime-to-roar guitars, wobbly organs, and drums that help conjure the melodrama. But Palladino's adaptability is clearly Exitmusic's anchor, the unifying characteristic that allows the band to scatter from film to dance music, from post-rock heights to mellow-gold lows.</p>
<p>In the wake of so many Silver Lake indie hitmakers and Williamsburg careerists, it's tempting to dismiss Exitmusic as the vain time-sink of two well-to-do adults suspended in artistic adolescence. Perhaps you assume that the indie rock aspirations of a starlet who once acted opposite Scarlett Johansson must somehow smack of condescension. But to Exitmusic's great credit, Church is no <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13415-break-up/"" target=""_blank"">Pete Yorn</a>, and there's very little that's precious or reserved about this music or the way Palladino sings. Instead, it's audacious and ambitious, twisting lyrics about depravity and loneliness into shared anthems meant for overcoming both. More than a cash-in or credibility play, <i>Passage</i> simply pulls several familiar objects into one detailed picture, a predictably good look from a pair whose script seems every bit as written as much as lived.  </p></div>"|16643.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16643-passage/|7.6|Grayson Currin

His work as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/698-casiotone-for-the-painfully-alone/"" target=""_blank"">Casiotone for the Painfully Alone</a>, an often lo-fi, not-always-Casiotone-based indie pop project that officially came to an end in 2010, encompassed a range of emotions that often tasted more ""bitter"" than ""sweet."" Regret, longing, desire, scorn, and jealousy frequently featured on the menu, but what made those feelings resonate was the presence of memory in his songwriting, the idea that even the most painful experiences are worth remembering. That's why his earliest material was so diaristic, as well as why he once chose to write a song reminiscing on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrVUtU3gvkI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">when bridge tolls amounted to no more than ""one single crisp clean dollar bill.""</a> 2009's final Casiotone album, the anti-procreation treatise <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13012-vs-children/"" target=""_blank""><i>Vs. Children</i></a>, is perhaps his most cynical work to date, but the concluding song ""White Jetta"" punctuated ruminations on sick mothers and unstable bloodlines with a mantra about staying young forever: ""To stay the same/ To never change.""</p>
<p>Three years removed, and Owen Ashworth's shell has cracked. <i>A Shut-In's Prayer</i> is the proper debut from his new project, <a href=""http://www.advancebasemusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Advance Base</a>, and it's easily the most wistful work he's committed to tape. Couched in the most immediate and affecting melodies of his career, many of the stories told on <i>A Shut-In's Prayer</i> look back at the past mainly to remember its contents. Ashworth's flair for narrative detail is in top form, achieving a level so microscopic that, at one point, he zooms in while ruminating on familial ennui to describe a scene in a horror movie that several characters are watching together. Sometimes, as on the album highlight ""Riot Grrrls"", these trips down memory lane end with resolution-- or, at least, as much resolution that you could get from two college-age outcasts ""Wondering if we ran/ Who'd miss us."" Elsewhere, memories take on the form of child runaways and faded filial relationships, as Ashworth is left with disconnected threads between the past and present and not much more.</p>
<p>As a songwriter and, by proxy, as a human being, Ashworth's certainly grown since he started plinking out tape-hiss anti-anthems back in 1998. You can hear his musical progression in the pretty, at-times lush instrumentation on display here, a logical progression from the baroque figures of <i>Vs. Children</i> with added intimacy. He's made leaps and bounds as a singer, too: For all its warm mid-fi glow and quaint arrangements, <i>A Shut-In's Prayer</i> retains its affecting strength thanks to Ashworth's vocal performances. It still feels like a stretch to call him a ""singer"" by most mainstream standards, but the occasional sullen sneer of his earlier work has been smoothed out.</p>
<p>He's found a nice pocket of resonance in his low-pitched voice, and his higher register is pleasant and sing-songy. Ashworth uses the latter disarmingly on ""More Trouble"", the album's most easygoing and upbeat tune that, upon closer inspection, is about the grim inevitability of waiting for bad news from a doctor. There are a few songs on <i>A Shut-In's Prayer</i> that deal with such weighty subject matter-- ""New Gospel""'s advice to a substance-addled depressive, the troubled sibling relationship detailed in ""My Sister's Birthday""-- but the album otherwise largely carries the type of fuzzy sadness that you'd get from looking at old pictures of past (and, possibly, better) times. That such an openly nostalgic album is seeing release on Caldo Verde is a humorous coincidence, given that its founder, Red House Painters/Sun Kil Moon mastermind Mark Kozelek, recently waxed nostalgic on ""Sunshine in Chicago"", a gorgeous cut from SKM's forthcoming album <i>Among the Leaves</i>. If 2012 is the year that downer-music veteran loner types finally start to express some sort of happiness, out of their fondness of the past or otherwise, then so be it.</p>
<p><i>A Shut-In's Prayer</i> is arguably the strongest album of Owen Ashworth's career thus far, and it arrives at a time when the influence of his former project looms over specific spheres of indie music. The trapped-in-suburbia haze of Youth Lagoon's Trevor Powers carries Casiotone's torch of homespun intimacy; Mike Hadreas takes the project's raconteurish flair to new, bruising depths as Perfume Genius; and South Carolina songwriter Mat Cothran's Coma Cinema project possesses the cynicism of Ashworth's youth. As those young artists continue to grow, so does Owen Ashworth, and this new chapter of his 15-year run carries such promise that fixating on the past almost seems pointless, since the future potentially holds so much more in store.</p></div>"|16656.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16656-a-shut-ins-prayer/|7.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

But want to know what band's been most consistently holding the Classic City down for the past decade? Not R.E.M., they were coasting on cred even before they went defunct. of Montreal? Please, you're thinking too hard. Drive-By Truckers? Definitely a contender. But the answer here would be jam-band warhorses Widespread Panic.</p>
<p>I use this exercise as a reminder that Athens is an artistic utopia but also essentially a suburb of Atlanta, and like any major college town, many of the 30-40,000 kids who call it home seriously like nothing more than to throw the fuck down. This explains why Athens is every bit as likely to spawn a band like <a href=""http://reptarmusic.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Reptar</a> as it is Pylon, and it's not just because their <a href=""http://www.collapseboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/reptarzzzzzzz.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">press photos look like surveillance footage from an AEPi hazing ritual.</a> With all the indiscriminate enthusiasm and unearned confidence of young adults on the precipice of self-discovery, Reptar uses their debut <i>Body Faucet </i>as a vat in which to hastily dump the past five years of top shelf indie into some kind of frat party-stoking jungle juice.</p>
<p>But if <i>Body Faucet </i>indeed replaces the likes of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvlQgh7aDDA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""That Was a Crazy Game of Poker""</a> during at least one keg bust, it's done a tremendous service, right? Seems kinda churlish to harsh the vibes since Reptar are clearly friendly guys not trying to put one over on us: This isn't fronting like a replacement for the likes of Vampire Weekend or Passion Pit or Yeasayer or Animal Collective and Reptar are likely just as excited for those bands' new albums as you are. Besides, even if everything about the band screams that it wasn't a matter of <i>if </i>they were going to name themselves after a kitschy 90s reference, but <i>which one</i>, the fact a remarkably similar but exponentially more awful band named Coolrunnings exists means we could do a lot worse. </p>
<p>Still, <i>Body Faucet </i>proudly manifests its influence on about as basic of a level as possible, right down to the hiring of Ben H. Allen. We're still obligated to mention he produced <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12518-merriweather-post-pavilion/"" target=""_blank"">Merriweather Post Pavilion</a>, </i>but his C.V.'s getting awful crammed with the likes of Fanfarlo and Bombay Bicycle Club, starched-shirt indie-pop bands looking for an extreme ""Summertime Clothes"" makeover. Reptar was always pretty tie-dye to begin with, but they fit in that lineage, since <i>Body Faucet </i>operates on fairly standard melodic progressions that could be strummed out by any acoustic-toting dorm rover. But under Allen's guidance, they're doubled by plinky electric guitar runs, tripled by keyboards, and if that's not enough, hey, we got these kids here, let’s have <i>them </i>sing the hook. This extends what otherwise might've been punchy songs past five minutes, but it's all there, the jumpy polyrhythms and wiggled guitar runs and buzzing synth riffs shellacked to a blinding sheen so it'll play just as good to people who think King Sunny Ade is a juice stand at Lenox Square Mall. </p>
<p>But so what if their Afro-tribal-electro-twee-pop is indeed all sugar and no roughage; is it a crime to make Annuals look like they were actually ahead of their time? No, but all of the above means essentially little since every time Graham Ulicny <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGQjyGT1-mc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">opens up his throat</a>, you just wanna yell ""this is all <i>your </i>fault!"" at the nearest .jpeg of Panda Bear and Avey Tare. I mean, it really is: I've always considered <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion </i>to be <i>The Soft Bulletin </i>of its decade and 10 years ago, the Reptars of the indiesphere sported a mewling, no-attack whine decked out by saturated synth strings and drums redlining with distortion. But Animal Collective understood the relationship between form and function, and the visceral shrieking of their earlier work was meant as a conveyance for the primal, occasionally unspeakable urges contained therein. But despite attempts at lyrical heft detailing a too-vague sexual awakening (""Sebastian"") and an encomium for a friend (""Ghost Bike""), Ulicny undermines himself on a second-by-second basis by finding no lyric that can't be subjected to at least six different forms of contortion regardless of its content. Is there any reason for a line such as ""Daniel left you for another boy/ Indeed he did you like a windup toy/ Oh why-o, why-o"" to be sung like you're trying to one-up Dave Longstreth in a vocal game of H.O.R.S.E.?  I mean, if you're going to stuff a song called ""Orifice Origami"" with four octaves of goosed-up pitch exaggeration and reserve your most strangulated affectations to deliver the title of ""Please Don't Kill Me"", does that mean you have all the self-awareness in the world or absolutely none at all? </p>
<p>Not that gravitas should be expected from a band whose name instantly inspires memories of raspy cartoon toddlers in awe of a monster dinosaur. And from most accounts, Reptar are ""known"" for their ""fun live show,"" understandable because they are nothing if not insistent: <i>Body Faucet </i>as a whole clocks in at damn near an hour, which would be wholly indefensible, but then again, you come from a place like Athens, 35 minutes is not gonna give a Caledonia crowd enough time to get as liquored up as they want. I have to admit, sometimes I wonder if I resent <i>Body Faucet </i>for making me feel way older than my years, but then I mostly realize I don't envy college kids in the age of Twitter, because Reptar <i>is </i>their kind of band: accessible to way more information than they can fully process, desperate for attention, and prone to the most public of embarrassments.</p></div>"|16760.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16760-reptar-body-faucet/|3.0|Ian Cohen

Late last year, <a href=""http://octobersveryown.blogspot.com/2011/11/im-really-scared-for-my-generation-you.html"">Drake wrote a blog post criticizing Tumblr</a>, at a time when acts from Dirty Beaches to Grimes could be seen as building specific tastes (David Lynch, K-pop) into their aesthetic identities almost as overtly as if they were re-blogging a YouTube video. The gap between how records sound and the personal experiences they can bring to mind is also a crucial theme of one of my favorite albums of 2012, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16502-europe/"" target=""_blank""><i>Europe</i>, by Allo Darlin'</a>.</p>
<p>This idea of pop as personal has been integral to Saint Etienne for more than two decades. With a pair of former music journalists in their ranks (Bob Stanley has written for Pitchfork, <i>Uncut</i>, and more), the London trio can't help but comment on pop even as they're brilliantly making it, from early singles like 1992's Lovin' Spoonful-invoking ""Join Our Club"" to the Red Hot Chili Peppers-dissing penultimate track on 2005's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6976-tales-from-turnpike-house/"" target=""_blank""><i>Tales From Turnpike House</i></a>. The group's first proper album since then, <i>Words and Music by Saint Etienne</i>, is a sterling affirmation that relating pop music to your life doesn't have to grow more difficult as you get older.</p>
<p>It's not as if Saint Etienne have been standing still all these years. When not serving in a year-long artists' residency at London's Royal Festival Hall, putting together a documentary called <i>This Is Tomorrow</i>, or working on an upcoming book (Stanley's <i>Do You Believe in Magic?</i>), these pop savants have also reissued their back catalog, put out a highly recommended compilation (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12282-london-conversations-the-best-of-saint-etienne/"" target=""_blank""><i>London Conversations</i></a>, which in some formats included two new songs), and tapped producer Richard X to remix their entire 1991 debut album as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/36465-saint-etiennes-foxbase-alpha-to-be-remixed-by-richard-x/"" target=""_blank""><i>Foxbase Beta</i></a>, among too many other projects to list.</p>
<p>All this looking back appears to have reminded Saint Etienne what they loved about pop in the first place. The perennially chic voice of singer Sarah Cracknell can be heard paying tribute to the wonders of portable listening (""I've Got Your Music""), of embracing a loved one while the right song plays (""DJ""), and even, hilariously, of chatting on a <a href=""http://freakytrigger.co.uk/sub/popular/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pop-music blog</a> that happens to be run by Pitchfork contributor Tom Ewing (""Popular""). The execution is mostly impeccable, with crystal-clear yet memorably idiosyncratic lyrics, and slick electro-pop production from the murderer's row of Richard X, Ian Catt, Nick Coler, and Tim Powell.</p>
<p>""I will surrender to the sound/ And look at all the kids around,"" Cracknell sings on advance single <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13045-tonight/"" target=""_blank"">""Tonight""</a>, a soaring, wonderfully vivid encapsulation of the giddiness you feel before seeing a favorite band. This use of ""kids"" is crucial, because it's a word that often pops up in songs intended for actual kids, but it also captures the truth of going to shows and festivals where the crowds seem to get younger every year. Saint Etienne have grappled with maturity before, particularly in the stylish return-to-the-nightlife of 2002's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6974-finisterre/"" target=""_blank""><i>Finisterre</i></a>, but <i>Words and Musi</i>c excels by realizing that there's no inherent conflict between youthful enthusiasm and adult perspective, if you put them together the right way.</p>
<p>Part of what's appealing about <i>Words and Music</i> is the way it maintains a contemporary Top 40 sheen without lowering itself to pandering, but it isn't all uptempo dance-pop. ""Heading for the Fair"" is the type of piano-house comedown that isn't so far off from the best of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15783-in-the-grace-of-your-love/"" target=""_blank"">the Rapture's latest album</a>, while ""Record Collector"" continues Saint Etienne's increasing use of harmonies for a sumptuously doo-wop a cappella vocal that could nestle in a playlist beside Drake's ""The Ride"" or Jens Lekman's ""Kanske Är Jag Kär I Dig"". The airier moments, such as the waltzing Euro-folk of ""I Threw It All Away"" or the Bacharach-lush <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13508-answer-song/"" target=""_blank"">""Answer Song""</a>, aren't quite as immediate as the dancefloor-oriented numbers, but they nicely balance the album.</p>
<p>It would be easy to go on and on about every cut on the record, which gracefully clears the admittedly ambiguous bar to become Saint Etienne's best LP since 1994 masterpiece <i>Tiger Bay</i>. But the group's Stanley, Cracknell, and Pete Wiggs, always their own sharpest critics, sum up <i>Words and Music </i>most eloquently on the two tracks that bookend it. The finale, like ""Teenage Winter"" seven years ago, uses spoken-word narration to describe a life lived with music, only this time in an optimistic sense. But it's the opening ""Over the Border"", with its loving reflections on youthful music fandom, that perfectly distills the album's theme: ""I used 'Top of the Pops' as my world atlas."" Past Saint Etienne albums have paid loving homage to London. This time, as the album art reinforces, they've wisely realized their real home town is global pop culture. In other words, they're your neighbors.</p></div>"|16636.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16636-words-and-music-by-saint-etienne/|7.8|Marc Hogan

The passage of time is sometimes palpable here. Three tracks in, ""DNA"" hits you like a Red Bull and vodka-drunken brick, stamped with producer RedOne's unmistakable Eurodance throb. On the next track, ""Crazy Bitch"", <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7171-akon/"" target=""_blank"">Akon</a> delivers an awkward chorus of ""She's a craaaaa-zzzyyy bitch/ That's why I love her/ That's why I love her"" over a guitar-strummy hook that could've easily been a Travie McCoy throwaway. Later, a nondescript male voice drops in, rapping, ""Lookin' at your behind/ Pull your pants down/ Baby, it's hammer time."" Who's that? Oh, sure-- it's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29472-tyga/"" target=""_blank"">Tyga</a>, YMCMB underachiever-turned-<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE3yia1AJeQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Rack City""</a> star.</p>
<p><i>Go! Pop! Bang!</i>, whose release was pushed back for a solid three or four years for a litany of likely reasons, is peppered with these marks of 11th-hour cramming and last-minute attempts to achieve broader marketability and relevance. If that sounds familiar, it's probably because the parallel struggles of Nicki Minaj's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16471-pink-friday-roman-reloaded/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded</i></a> are fresh in your mind. Female rappers are often unjustly tasked with additional pop-star duties in order to gain commercial viability, and the crossover terrain is understandably tricky to navigate.</p>
<p>Luckily Rye Rye's stacked the album with songs that fit more naturally in her catalog, and she makes a valiant experimental effort in the space between. The 21-year-old proves that she was ahead of the curve as a young teenager performing in Baltimore, and that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2935-mia/"" target=""_blank"">M.I.A.</a> was smart to recruit her when she assembled her (now <a href=""http://neetrecordings.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">possibly defunct?</a>) N.E.E.T. team long ago. Much of the record's best material has been around for years: Rye Rye broke out with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29468-blaqstarr/"" target=""_blank"">Blaqstarr</a>-produced <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CN7p8M7S8Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Shake It to the Ground""</a>, and the song's minimal Baltimore club beat and plucky schoolyard taunts sound fresher than ever in 2012 (and the more central her distinct bubblegum flow, the more capable and engaging Rye Rye sounds as a rapper).</p>
<p>M.I.A. appears as a welcome-- if sometimes unnecessary-- cheerleader throughout the record, from 2008's frenetic and aptly-titled <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11216-bang-ft-mia/"" target=""_blank"">""Bang""</a> (appearing as a bonus track here) to a newer-sounding ""Better Than You"". On that track, the duo repurposes the classic <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmoKhFJRUOk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Annie Get Your Gun</i> tune</a> ""Anything You Can Do"" for an anthem that blasts conformity in characteristic M.I.A. fashion. And then there's ""Sunshine"", another M.I.A.-Rye Rye pairing from 2010 whose sepia-warm <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nsrygut8X6U&amp;ob=av2e"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">playground visual</a> probably deserves another look as spring clicks into summer. The young rapper adjusts smoothly to a hodgepodge of sounds, from a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llyiQ4I-mcQ"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vengaboys sample</a> on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13339-boom-boom/"" target=""_blank"">""Boom Boom""</a> to a lurking, futuristic Bangladesh beat on ""Hotter"". Warmth and color fill most of the deluxe edition's (admittedly bloated) 60 minutes, an assortment of bubbly beats forming in gleeful, block party-ready disarray. </p>
<p>For a long time it looked like a shelved <i>Go! Pop! Bang!</i> would go quietly into the night, and no one would have paid much attention if it had. For all of the false starts the record took last year (including a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z3OIACLcg0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">collaboration with Robyn</a> and <a href=""http://maddecent.com/blog/rye-rye-dj-sega-ryeot-powrr-mixtape"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>RYEot PowRR</i></a>, an incredibly fun mixtape meant as an appetite-whetting preview), there's been virtually no fuss made for the album's ultimate release date. No new videos, tour announcements, or dramatic tracklist unveils. Instead the album's arrived as a pleasant surprise, better late than never.</p></div>"|16647.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16647-go-pop-bang/|7.0|Carrie Battan

Both Birds of Maya albums rule, but more importantly, they offer essential context for the band's two offshoots: Mike Polizze's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29258-purling-hiss/"" target=""_blank"">Purling Hiss</a>, and most recently, Jason Killinger's <a href=""http://spacin.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spacin'</a>.</p>
<p>Spacin' is Killinger, Sean Hamilton on bass, Paul Sukeena on lead guitar, and Killinger's wife Eva on drums. While Purling Hiss' sound doesn't stray far from the aesthetic presented on the Birds of Maya albums (except for more direct hooks and warblier production), the debut Spacin' album, <i>Deep Thuds</i>, offers two distinct sounds: extremely direct rock'n'roll with muddy production and spacier tracks that stretch out for several minutes. Killinger's implementation of both techniques makes <i>Deep Thuds</i> compulsively listenable. ""Chest of Steel"", for example, is driven by a sunny, catchy, triumphant guitar solo, so even while the lyrics are semi-unintelligible, the hook dominates. Compare that to the second track on the album, ""Some Future (Burger)""-- over five minutes of quiet, meditative, melody-free atmosphere, which is satisfying in its subtlety. </p>
<p>Impressively, the album never sounds stilted or uneven. The moment ""Some Future"" ends, we get ""Wrong Street"", which features a thudding bassline and a ripping, psychedelic guitar solo (and a brief, two-bar guest appearance from Polizze). Then there's the quiet jungle groove of ""Oh, Man"", which features intricate, subtle guitar tinges over its almost seven minutes. The album has seven tracks; each one offers a different soundscape, and somehow, the songs never clash with one another or sound out of place. That's a testament to how beautifully arranged <i>Deep Thuds</i> is.</p>
<p>Here's the other thing about this album: When Killinger delivers a song that's led by a dominant hook, it hits every time. Sometimes, it comes from a bare bones three- or four-chord melody, like the driving power chords of ""Chest of Steel"" and ""Empty Mind"". And sometimes, it's from a central guitar solo that pulls an entire song's weight. ""Ego-go"", for example, rides a hypnotic riff that creates an atmosphere akin to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4134-the-stooges/"" target=""_blank"">the Stooges</a>' ""Gimme Danger"", and similarly, the song culminates in a huge guitar solo. ""Sunshine, No Shoes"" offers a breezy melody, crunching guitar, and verse to match the track title. And because those songs are bookended by some palate-cleansing atmospheric tracks, stuff like that riff from ""Chest of Steel"" get a much deserved spotlight. </p>
<p>But honestly, how can an album called <i>Deep Thuds</i> by a band called Spacin' with a drippy Rolling Stones logo on its cover not be remotely funny? Everything about the band's presentation says the album should be frontloaded with irony or snotty humor, but there's nothing like that here. Instead, it's a record that's patient, flows beautifully, offers sludgy production, and is packed with killer hooks. It's an album that uses fuzzed-out guitar for bursts of gutter shredding ferocity. It's a record that sounds like it could owe as much to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6134-grouper/"" target=""_blank"">Grouper</a> as it does to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4469-the-velvet-underground/"" target=""_blank"">the Velvet Underground</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5395-hawkwind/"" target=""_blank"">Hawkwind</a> or the Stooges. No, it's not a nonstop shredfest like Birds of Maya's albums, but each deep thud rules.</p></div>"|16659.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16659-deep-thuds/|7.8|Evan Minsker

All five current Feelies were involved at some point, and the only record the Trypes ever released-- 1984's 4-song <i>The Explorers Hold</i> EP-- has a distinct Feelies vibe. It's filled with the Zen strumming and Moe Tucker-ish beats of late-80s Feelies albums <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13403-crazy-rhythms-the-good-earth/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Good Earth</i></a> and <i>Only Life</i>. One song, the rolling ""The Undertow"", even showed up later in very similar form on <i>Only Life</i>.</p>
<p>But the Trypes were more than an offshoot. They started as a quartet with no Feelies members, and when Feelies guitarist/singer Glenn Mercer joined, his other band had technically broken up and he was just looking to play drums. More importantly, the Trypes were part of an overlapping circle of N.J. outfits-- including the Feelies, Yung Wu, and the Willies-- whose work had a casual, familial feel. Often it sounded like they were making music for each other rather than an audience.</p>
<p>That's why the title <i>Music for Neighbors</i>­­­­-- taken from a series these bands put on at Haledon, N.J., bar the Peanut Gallery-- is such a perfect name for Acute's selection from the Trypes archives. Alongside <i>The Explorers Hold</i> EP, the LP-plus-digital-download set collects demos, live performances, and practice sessions at Hoboken's legendary Maxwell's club. This previously unreleased material is compelling mostly because of its personal, homemade aura. Unpolished and unassuming, it creates an apt portrait of a band that, as Mercer explains in the liner notes, ""sprung out of a series of weekly, informal, neighborhood gatherings, playing sparse and simple music on a local level for our own enjoyment.""</p>
<p>Sparseness and simplicity permeate all of the Trypes' songs, which were often built on a two-chord strum, up-down organ chords, or a repetitive beat. Mercer cites the group's fusing of ""the harder, New York edge of the Velvet Underground and the softer, West Coast vibe of the psychedelic bands,"" and you can hear that combo throughout, plus some baroque folk leanings. But more interesting than the Trypes' genre mixing is their knack for making every note sound intimate and lived-in. It helps that these recordings are rather lo-fi, giving <i>Music for Neighbors</i> a personal atmosphere not far from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1874-half-japanese/"">Half Japanese</a> or the chord-organ tunes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2202-daniel-johnston/"">Daniel Johnston</a>. But this isn't primitive music-- the Trypes prove equally adept at gentle ballads, grinding dirges, classic-rock covers, and a seven-minute jam called ""Life History"" that sounds like the Feelies channeling <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/666-can/"">Can</a>.</p>
<p>Such range was apparently easy for musicians so familiar with each other. As Elbrus Kelemet sings on ""Force of Habit"", ""We get together everyday at this time/ It has been so long now it's hard to say why/ Must be a habit or we wouldn't go on."" They actually didn't go on that long, ending when the Feelies reformed and the original members morphed into the still-active <a href=""http://www.speedtheplough.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Speed the Plough</a>. But at its best, <i>Music for Neighbors</i> evokes a parallel world, one in which the Trypes still meet up regularly to make more songs for each other.</p></div>"|16644.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16644-music-for-neighbors/|7.5|Marc Masters

It's not exactly a sphere that rewards, or even encourages, curiosity: The language used to assess soloists in Hahn's rarefied air comes disturbingly close the the kind used to appraise prize ponies, and the city-to-city nature of the violin-concerto circuit can make for a life that is almost as cloistered and repetitive. But Hahn has resisted stagnation, recording with alt-country singer/songwriter Josh Ritter, the folk singer Tom Brosseau, and even <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/91-and-you-will-know-us-by-the-trail-of-dead/"" target=""_blank"">...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead</a> (that's her on <i>Worlds Apart</i>'s <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_4BqMUZWA4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""To Russia My Homeland""</a>).  She never seems to be insisting on a strident break from the world of orchestral tours, commissions, and Tchaikovsky concertos with any of these new projects -- just looking for something fresh and interesting to do. It has made her career one of the most refreshingly graceful ones in classical music. No project she has undertaken has felt forced, and that includes her decision to hole up in Iceland for two months to make a record with <a href=""http://hauschka-net.de/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hauschka</a>.</p>
<p>Hauschka (real name: Volker Bertelmann) is a German pianist and indie classical composer who plays his piano ""prepared,"" i.e., with small things placed on the piano's strings to produce new tones, à la John Cage. Over a series of albums filled with wistful miniature sketches, he's built a weird little sound world where the grotesque walks arm-in-arm with the twee. His pieces evoke a world of broken, rickety instruments, populated entirely by small, limping things. They can be nerve-rendingly cute and cloying, but at their best, they evoke the peculiar sadness you might feel when looking at, say, a toy-strewn suburban lawn.</p>
<p><i>Silfra</i> is the result of Hahn and Hauschka's disappearing into an Iceland studio, feeling their way around each other, and recording an album based on their resulting improvisations. This sounds like a recipe for an undercooked mess, but <i>Silfra</i> succeeds where Hauschka's solo records haven't always, in part because his world sounds fuller and more inviting with collaborators in it. <i>Silfra</i> feels and sounds like two serious-minded musicians growing increasingly comfortable with each other, allowing themselves to be playful and silly. Together, they have managed to build a livelier, more bustling version of Hauschka's winsome snowglobe universe.</p>
<p>Hahn, for her part, does something that could be considered shocking for violinists in her circle: she willfully drains her million-dollar tone of most of its prettiness. Her playing on <i>Silfra</i> is often sickly, wheezing or shrill, in keeping with the slightly damaged sound of Hauschka's piano. On ""North Atlantic"", she plays a mournful melody with a breathy, anemic tone, while Hauschka's piano produces a dry ""skree"" sound that pokes the eardrum like a needle. She begins ""Draw a Map"" with a forceful gypsy dance that starts hobbling shortly after it gets started: The two of them doodle all over the melody's pristine surface with pockmarks and scribbles. If there's a dance being done here, it's on at least one bad leg.</p>
<p>In the album's liner notes, Hauschka and Hahn lay out specific stories and characters for each track, and a lot of them, it turns out, involved human meddling with existing structures: ""Adash"", for instance, is ""the name of a boy who loves music and scratches lines into his CDs to create unpredictable catches, so that he can hear a section over and over again before it skips ahead to the next part."" ""Clock Winder"" notes: ""Some mechanisms still need human interaction to function."" This gleeful tinkerer's spirit is what animates <i>Silfra</i>. It is music about fiddling around happily with music's guts, and it's most absorbing when heard through a fat pair of high-quality headphones, where you can register every scrape, plunk, creak, and twang.</p></div>"|16639.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16639-silfra/|7.3|Jayson Greene

As he told Brandon Stosuy in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/update/8840-mount-eerie/"" target=""_blank"">last week's Pitchfork interview</a>, he recently took an extended break from touring to record <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45519-mount-eerie-to-release-two-new-albums-this-year/"" target=""_blank"">two albums</a> there, and he speaks of it as a calming, recentering time: ""The songs and the ideas came from a more slowed-down attention to this particular place, this town, walking from my house to the studio and back every day,"" Elverum told him. The second album of the pair, to be called <i>Ocean Roar</i>, will be out later this year; Elverum calls it ""more challenging and weird and darker and heavier."" For now, however, he has given us <i>Clear Moon</i>, an album that makes a vast, cool sanctuary of itself and quietly beckons you in. Inscrutable and transfixing, plainspoken and unknowable, it feels like a collection of secrets Elverum has cupped in his palm to pour directly, and privately, into your ear alone, a rich meditation on the many meanings of the word ""home.""</p>
<p>""I go on describing this place/ And the way it feels to live and die"" is how Elverum summarizes his task on <i>Clear Moon</i> in the album's opening song, ""Through the Trees, Pt. 2"". The line also neatly serves as any great writer's ultimate mission statement: Your backyard is a gateway to the universe, if you look hard enough. Note the song title's tricky numerology: We seem to be joining Elverum in the middle of an ongoing, possibly endless cataloging task. (Elverum, of course, has a documented fondness for ""Pt. 2's"".) The song names all have the quality of bullet points in some strange thesis: ""The Place Lives"", the second song, is followed by ""The Place I Live"", and it feels like Elverum is using these phrases to draw some obscure distinctions that are very important to him. ""If I look/ Or if I don't look/ Clouds are always passing over,"" he sings on ""The Place I Live"". It's a statement that can read as perversely comforting or profoundly depressing-- the universe doesn't disappear when I blink, on the one hand, and the universe wouldn't blink if I disappeared, on the other. Elverum's sighed inflection cradles both of these meanings with equal gentleness.</p>
<p>The album's sound, meanwhile has the misty-but-tactile feeling of a sense memory. Every sound echoes from side to side of the mix, and the effect isn't so much ""panning"" as it is a shimmering omnipresence. Acoustic guitars, light keyboards, muted but persistent drums-- the sounds on <i>Clear Moon</i> feel like anxious, living beings that are trying to whisper something to you that you don't want to know. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13513-lone-bell/"" target=""_blank"">""Lone Bell""</a> is the moment where Elverum's existential quandaries suddenly sprout fangs and grow frightening: Sharp horn blats and insistently hammering guitars evoke fight-or-flight dread, danger, encroaching panic. The bassline keeps crawling up a modal minor scale in the center of the song, posing the same uneasy question, over and over.</p>
<p>What that question is remains deliciously out of verbal range, but <i>Clear Moon</i>'s brought a sharp memory into relief for me: It reminded me of standing outside of my house as a child, on a cold night. From the street, the house, broadcasting its fragile comfort out to me, looked a little unreal: Elverum calls a song on the album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13341-house-shape/"" target=""_blank"">""House Shape""</a>. You know you will be allowed back in, but you stand for a prolonged moment, looking into the lit windows, and tasting something uneasy in your mouth. <i>Clear Moon</i> summons, inhabits, and distends this moment for 42 consecutive minutes.</p></div>"|16657.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16657-clear-moon/|8.3|Jayson Greene

The career of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5864-andrew-weatherall/"">Andrew Weatherall</a> is a product of his instinctual way of hearing, of feeling out sounds and slotting them together in unexpected ways. This is true of his work as a DJ, remixer, producer, and as a musician. Whenever he's surfaced at the forefront of a movement-- working with label and zine Boys Own in the early acid house days, helping indie and dance seep into one another via his seminal production on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3394-primal-scream/"">Primal Scream</a>'s ""Loaded""-- he always played a part in actively devising those worlds. His career is marked by a continual reinvention as the most unassuming type of leader, although Weatherall would probably regard that description as a pejorative term, especially given the haste with which he flees from anything that could be described as a ""scene."" Usually he doesn't even wait until his ideas reach critical mass, instead choosing to disappear in a puff of smoke, already lost deep in a broad range of new fascinations.</p>
<p><i>Masterpiece</i> is a 3xCD set in a series of the same name devised by <a href=""http://www.ministryofsound.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ministry of Sound</a>, which allows artists ample space to mix up past and present favorites. Weatherall chose to theme his mixes around his most recent club venture, A Love from Outer Space, conducted with his long-term accomplice Sean Johnston at a tiny dive bar in Stoke Newington in London. The simple manifesto of the club, ""never knowingly exceeding 122bpm,"" is roughly adhered to here, and has partially led to a coining of the term ""cosmic disco"" to describe the music played within its sweat-soaked walls. There's something about the whole package that neatly ties together Weatherall's approach to his work, from his bemusement in the sleeve notes about the ""cosmic disco"" moniker to the not inconsiderable fact that the club just ended its residency in Stoke Newington. Once again he's moved on just as the outside world is catching up, although we do at least have this memento to chew on and the promise of isolated ALFOS club nights across the globe. </p>
<p>The name of the club is pulled from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=a.r.+kane"">A.R. Kane</a> <i>""i"" </i>cut ""A Love From Outer Space"", and versions of the track bookend this compilation. The opener is from Weatherall's new band with producer Timothy J. Fairplay, the Asphodells, and the third disc closes out with the A.R. Kane original. It's a fitting way to seal up both ends of <i>Masterpiece</i>, because the influence of the semi-legendary dreampop outfit continually bobs to the surface, whether it's in the skysawing guitars of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4990-the-horrors/"">the Horrors</a>' ""Wild Eyed"" (presented here in its Weatherall remix) or through the sunken astral-dub of Aquarius Heaven's reworking of ""Decontrol"" by the Subs. It speaks highly of Weatherall's intuitive way of detecting musical sea changes that his club has been obsessing over A.R. Kane for the past two years. It's not hard to hear their influence weaving in and out of a number of acts (<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29484-peaking-lights/"">Peaking Lights</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30373-dean-blunt-inga-copeland/"">Dean Blunt and Inga Copeland</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28673-tame-impala/"">Tame Impala</a>) currently flitting between similar light and dark pop impulses on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>So Weatherall's radar remains firmly intact, but all three mixes here additionally demonstrate his broad pallet and his idiosyncratic way of forging links between the underground and more populist fare. Weatherall is a big-picture thinker, who can step back from tightly clustered musical cliques to find common ground in the impeccable glide of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/14576-todd-terje/"">Todd Terje</a>'s ""Ragysh"", the ragged rock of Glasgow quartet <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4089-sons-and-daughters/"">Sons &amp; Daughters</a>, and the watery psych passages of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5482-wooden-shjips/"">Wooden Shjips</a>' ""Crossing"". Anyone taking a cursory glance at the track listing might be befuddled at how it all works together, but that's a Weatherall trademark, a feeling he's often distilled when his name is affixed to record labels belonging to acts as diverse as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5025-the-twilight-sad/"">the Twilight Sad</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2163-james/"">James</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5894-my-bloody-valentine/"">My Bloody Valentine</a>. Like all the best mixes, the joins rarely show, and familiar tracks act as gateways into unexplored worlds, such as the impeccable slide from Weatherall's glacial reworking of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5730-cut-copy/"">Cut Copy</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12890-sun-god-andrew-weatherall-remix/"">""Sun God""</a> into Bulgarian producer Bogdan Irkük's raw minimalism on ""My Weakness"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">For Weatherall, all good DJ sets offer some form of education, whether it's being introduced to someone like Irkük or hearing a new twist on an older track, such as the reggae-ified version of Primal Scream's ""Uptown"" from the largely forgotten-about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12024-beautiful-future/""><i>Beautiful Future</i></a>. ""It's pompous to expect a history lesson when you go out [to a club], but that's how it should be,"" Weatherall says in the sleeve notes. <i>Masterpiece</i> also offers a few lessons on the current. Fairplay, in particular, offers a couple of impressive tracks, notably on a remix of ""The Final Reel"" that plays out like an instrumental version of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3031-new-order/"">New Order</a> indulging all their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1040-death-in-vegas/"">Death in Vegas </a>circa ""Dirt"" fantasies. ""The Final Reel"" is balanced on the kind of line Weatherall frequently likes to tread, with its roots firmly in the underground he inhabits, but strung out with so many hooks that it could easily court a wider audience with the right push behind it. </p>
<p>In a sense, that's the path Weatherall's talent has led him on throughout his career, causing demand to far outstrip supply in the intimate club experiences he cultivates. Small nights he's worked (Shoom, Sabersonic, A Love from Outer Space) blossom because of the sense of community and inclusion they create, where audio secrets don't remain that way for long and are excitedly shared with the wider world by those lucky enough to get through the door. It's why we're left with <i>Masterpiece</i> offering us further in-roads into Weatherall's current mindset, and it's why ALFOS was destined to end up overflowing with people banging down its door from the moment it was conceived. But this is the best kind of way to quit, before the buzz starts to fade, before the flab starts to show, before a sense of trading on past glories begins to kick in. Weatherall knows it's time to say goodbye when it feels like the rest of the world is looking over his shoulder. At least this album made sure we got some generous signposts left behind. </p></div>"|16652.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16652-masterpiece/|7.8|Nick Neyland

But the band's most distinct, and even quietly innovative, quality is its vocals: Guitarist Raven Mahon, bassist Hannah Lew, and drummer Lillian Maring all sing, their voices colliding in off-kilter, prismatic harmonies. This vocal approach gives their songs a diffuse, uncanny atmosphere: At times, their bouncy tunes sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3517-the-raincoats/"" target=""_blank"">Raincoats</a> songs that have become lost in a hall of mirrors.</p>
<p>Since 2009, Grass Widow have honed this technique on a couple of increasingly solid albums-- the best being their 2010 Kill Rock Stars release <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14595-past-time/"" target=""_blank""><i>Past Time</i></a>-- but their latest, <i>Internal Logic</i>, is the first where they sound in total command of their sound. <i>Past Time</i> songs like ""Tuesday"" had a gleeful, teetering dynamism about them, vocal melodies and guitar lines jutting out in all directions. On <i>Internal Logic</i>, though, all the moving parts work together with the barebones utility of a go-kart. Mahon's riffs have a motorik, low-end grumble, Maring's drumming a steady sputter, and a rubbery propulsion to Lew's basslines; the harmonies float up around these tight arrangements like exhaust, woozy-sweet. ""Flying past the buildings,"" they sing on the album's first single, ""Milo Minute"", and you can almost feel the wind mussing up your hair.</p>
<p>There's evidence all over <i>Internal Logic</i> that Grass Widow have spent the two years since <i>Past Time</i> tightening up their sound. The angular, warbling energy that animates lead-off track <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13336-goldilocks-zone/"" target=""_blank"">""Goldilocks Zone""</a> or the strolling, mid-tempo vibe of ""Under the Atmosphere"" suggest a band that isn't interested in adding new and extraneous elements to its sound; instead, they're engaged in smart, subtle tune-ups, in learning how to make more with less. And if that sounds like DIY 101, it's not off the mark: <i>Internal Logic</i> is also the first release on their own label HLR (Hannah Lillian Raven) Records.</p>
<p>The songs on <i>Internal Logic</i> are like triple-exposed photographs, their nebulous, hazy qualities occasionally belying the acute skill with which they've been composed. ""It's not right/ Woke up in a different time,"" goes the three-part harmony on the buoyant ""Disappearing Industries"", and the line's sense of displacement is a fitting description of their sound. It feels fortunate that Grass Widow arrived on the scene a few years too late to be lumped in with the mid-aughts post-punk revival, because they've honed an approach that feels more personal and self-contained than it does trendy. Grass Widow pluck from the sounds of the past and then piece them back together with a logic all their own.</p></div>"|16637.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16637-internal-logic/|7.7|Lindsay Zoladz

Making things difficult for themselves, SMD try to borrow from both ends of the spectrum without ever fully embracing lowbrow or highbrow, all-grins fun or fearsomely precise grooves. 2007's debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10345-attack-decay-sustain-release/"" target=""_blank""><i>Attack Decay Sustain Release</i></a>, is their only album to really tackle the combination head-on, and probably not so coincidentally, it's also still their best. On <i>Attack</i>, SMD brought the underground's attention to detail and bubblegum dance's playfulness to what might have otherwise been churned-out bangers. They remembered the starkest acid tracks and the most cavernous bleep experiments were once played alongside stupid-fresh (or plain dumb-assed) hip-house foolishness.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard a thing SMD's done since <i>Attack</i>, you might think <i>Unpatterns </i>is the work of a completely different act. It's probably the most low-key and dazzle-averse SMD album yet. Gone are the sassy rollerskate-jam vocals and fat-bottomed rhythm tracks, along with any hint of rock-band bombast or hip-hop swagger. If all those sound like things that make life worth living, you may wish to proceed with caution. These 10 tracks build slowly, each crisp element added to the mix with a watchmaker's patience, and at their most energetic they're still pretty laid-back. SMD want part of the pleasure to be hearing that ingenuity in action, how you can build from just a rustle of synthetic snare drum to complex climax, all without going for obvious crowd-pleasing moves. It's not minimalism, at least in sense of your more acetic art-techno types, all scrawny sonics and inhibited groove. It's more like populist forms-- banging jack tracks on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13437-put-your-hands-together/"" target=""_blank"">""Put Your Hands Together""</a>, lush deep house on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13277-seraphim/"" target=""_blank"">""Seraphim""</a>-- stripped back to the most essential parts.</p>
<p>When it works, it's thrilling because SMD can provoke an emotional response, make you swoon or tense up or bust in-seat dance moves, with almost nothing, as if trying to one-up all those other producers who need luscious chord changes, rude basslines, over-the-top diva interjections, etc. But while these tracks want your total attention, they're just as often best appreciated as ambient with a lingering taste of club music, something that passes the time pleasantly enough without really sticking. SMD want these subtle shifts in beat and synth to sound momentous, but their desire for nuance sometimes get the better of them, the results crisply rendered but without any visceral hook or ear-engaging compositional oddness, the extras that makes even the most intellectual-minded dance music compulsively replayable. When disconnected bleeps on ""Cerulean"" finally resolve themselves into an astringent hook, just in time for the gentle beat to drop, it's clearly meant to be a nerve-tingling dancefloor epiphany, even if you're parked on your keester nowhere near a club. But the whole thing's so dainty and fussy that it provokes a shrug rather than a shudder, and it's too beholden to DJ formula to go anywhere surprising, to play with the really out-there kids in art-techno's first-rank.</p>
<p>The lackluster stuff on <i>Unpatterns</i> isn't a chore, the way smarty-pants dance can be when producers mistake restraint or difficult as intrinsically interesting qualities. But it does make you realize that one of SMD's gifts, as a rock band that defected into the dance world, was a fearlessness at incorporating elements (singing, bridges, dynamics) shrugged off by techno aesthetes who too often confuse monotonous with hypnotic. (It's not surprising that your ears will perk up every time a vocal drops in on <i>Unpatterns</i>.) The last few SMD discs have gone either all-pop or all-weird, with wildly different results, quality-wise and otherwise. 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13420-temporary-pleasure/"" target=""_blank""><i>Temporary Pleasure</i></a> erred by making the duo's crass hunger to crossover a little too overt for comfort, stuffing itself with limp performances by ringer guest singers and trying to pass off over-fussed loop music as radio-ready. (You know, just minus the <i>songs</i>.) 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14896-delicacies/"" target=""_blank""><i>Delicacies </i></a>could almost be heard as a band recoiling from an obvious mistake. The darker, stranger tracks offered few concessions to SMD's original dance-curious rock fanbase, even if the album occasionally tipped into the kind of rote ""stripped-down"" groove-making that's been everywhere in the last decade.</p>
<p>And that's where they've decided to stay, apparently, even if <i>Unpatterns</i> backs away from the darkness and moves tentatively toward the pleasure principle once again. This album may lack the wonky heights of <i>Delicacies</i>. It also stays far, far away from the cheeseball lows that stunk up <i>Temporary Pleasure</i>, something for which I guess we should be thankful. SMD are still stuck in the middle, and if they've finally happened on a formula that goes down smoothly for the length of a whole album, you may still find yourself missing the slick tricks and rough edges, all that dance-as-rock oomph and crap rapping, that once made them so endearing.</p></div>"|16654.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16654-unpatterns/|6.2|Jess Harvell

How to balance grandiosity and chops with catchiness? It's no easy task: The four-plus decades after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23575-procol-harum/"" target=""_blank"">Procol Harum</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8280-soft-machine/"" target=""_blank"">Soft Machine</a> are littered with countless failed attempts to merge pomp and pop. But it's one that Copenhagen group <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/choirofyoungbelievers"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Choir of Young Believers</a> are up to on their second LP, <i>Rhine Gold</i>, a hook-laden prog-pop opus for indie rock's post-<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/16266-holocene/"" target=""_blank"">""Holocene""</a> moment. Sure, they may have a moniker seemingly derived from a Sufjan Stevens band name generator and a swollen lineup that necessitates two adjoining tables at between-gig truck stops. But they've created a set of songs that successfully bridges whatever currently falls under the heading of ""post rock"" with the flanneliest of the past five years of American indie, and doesn't take itself too seriously along the way.</p>
<p>I'm speculating here, but it seems obvious to me that singer and songwriter Jannis Noya Makrigiannis starts his process by writing straightforward melodies, then stretches them out with brief detours and production flourishes without abandoning the simple core idea. On the gently psychedelic highlight <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFnjM7DdKws"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Sedated""</a>, for instance, a punchy, taut bassline and clip-clopping percussion are overlaid with a lead guitar line and vocal that gently ripple like sheets on a clothesline. This gives way to the hook: a gently eerie thing in which Makrigiannis floats above it all, gently buffeted by staccato piano plinks, before a quick string stab segues us back to do it all over again. You only have to listen once to understand this, but it ends with one of the more well-earned thunderclap sound effects you're bound to hear this year. Trust me: If you loved Midlake's ""Roscoe"" and Yeasayer's ""2080"", go ahead and drag this one to your ""best of 2012"" playlist.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In the context of the album, ""Sedated"" comes right after the slick ""Patricia's Thirst"", which both shows CYB's range and solidifies their recognizable sound. The spooky, quasi-Orientalist synth lines are uncanny-valley early MTV (not unlike those of the band's Ghostly International peers <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7374-school-of-seven-bells/"" target=""_blank"">School of Seven Bells</a>), but then Makrigiannis' soft tenor pilots the refrain heavenward again. It's a wonderful, perfectly executed pop moment that still manages to sneak up on me every time. Moments like these are in no short supply on <i>Rhine</i>, which is both exquisitely produced and has personality to spare. If you hear ""Paralyze"" and assume it's locking into the umpteenth motorik rehash, stick around for a few minutes (you do have 10 minutes, after all) as the band playfully tweaks the form a few times. I don't think I've ever heard a band successfully rev <i>back onto</i> the Autobahn quite like this.</p>
<p>Speaking of tweaking recognizable ideas, there's the matter of Makrigiannis' singing voice. It's a boyish, woodstained yowl that instantly suggests Ben Bridwell and Jim James, particularly when he lets it loose, which he does fairly often. As a result, about a third of <i>Rhine Gold</i> sounds pretty damn American, in the best possible way. The late-album one-two punch of ""Nye Nummer Et"" and ""Paint New Horrors"" surround the sepia-toned expansiveness of ""The Funeral"" and ""Wordless Chorus"" with sighing strings and off-kilter arrangements to great effect. Album opener ""The Third Time"" slowly takes shape over the first minute and a half of <i>Rhine </i>like a time-lapse sunrise rising through two mountain peaks, and when I initially heard Makrigiannis' voice appear without knowing his Danish address, I hurriedly typed down ""Americana Sigur Rós."" Copenhagen is separated from Reykjavik by about 1,300 miles of chilly sea, but like their Hopelandish bretheren, Choir of Young Believers have created a singular sonic world all their own. They don't let you get comfortable for too long at a stretch, but their itchy curiosity is its own reward.</p></div>"|16650.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16650-rhine-gold/|7.7|Eric Harvey

Circa 1999, Def Jux forged a fiefdom from the ashes of vinyl champs Fondle 'Em and the soon-to-be-ruined promise of Rawkus. ""Independent as fuck"" was the mantra, and for those wondering why MF Doom and the Roots couldn't get airplay, it may well have been a war cry.</p>
<p>Until Russell Simmons took a temporary sabbatical from model mongering to threaten a trademark-infringement lawsuit, even Def Jux's name riffed on (Darth) Def Jam, the rap overlord at its greased-up and growling Ruff Ryders, Jigga, and Ja Rule apex. But back when the ""Underground"" was tagged in capital letters, the promise of an alternate subterranean grid seemed infinite. Fat Beats did booming business. Hip-hop culture mags cropped up to survey the soundbombing. Clinton was President. Gas was $1 per gallon. A Bellevue-certified eccentric like Kool Keith could get Doctor Octagon dough from Dreamworks to squander in and around the West Hollywood IHOP.</p>
<p>During that last spring of the 20th Century, Rawkus Records released <i>Soundbombing II</i>-- an Underground <i>Now That's What I Call Music</i><i>!</i>-- that banged incessantly in dorm rooms across America and England. It marked the first and only time Eminem and El-P shared space on wax. Yet it didn't feel that weird at the time. People still used the phrase ""on wax"" and Shady had only recently signed to Interscope. To balance his quality time with Dr. Dre, Marshall Mathers also worked with people like Thirstin Howl III and Outsidaz. As the demented fan from ""Stan"" said: ""I like that shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat."" Not only did people still use the word ""phat,"" they opted to build clothing lines around it.</p>
<p>You can trace the genesis of <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/elproducto"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">El-P</a>'s solo career back to <i>Soundbombing II</i>'s ""Patriotism"". A five-minute fulguration to American culture and the military-industrial complex, it was credited to Company Flow, but his one-time rhyme partner Bigg Jus sat on the sidelines. The next year, the group released its final single, ""DPA""<i></i>. It was the second release on the fledgling Def Jux and doubled as a mission statement. This is ""heart of darkness,"" El-P fulminated and as if to prove his point, George W. Bush ""won"" the Electoral College several months later. He may have been referencing Joseph Conrad, but the Brooklyn bomber soon received a bête noire worthy of Richard Nixon and Raoul Duke. The new imprint existed to chronicle the fear and loathing. And by 2007's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10006-ill-sleep-when-youre-dead/"" target=""_blank""><i>I'll Sleep When You're Dead</i></a>, he confessed to ""a gonzomatic fear turning [him] Hunter S. Thompson.""</p>
<p>At least that was the image that took root. The reality was more and less sophisticated. Bizarro attempts to break the mold with funk-fusionists Chin Chin and the original Lonely Island, Party Fun Action Committee, rarely received the attention they deserved. Nor did the mutant howls of Camu Tao, whose genre-clobbering experimentation influenced Kid Cudi, Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire, and Danny Brown. Luck didn't lend itself to the Def Jux enterprise. Rjd2 could have re-made<i> Deadringer</i> a half-dozen times, and both label and artist could have reaped that soccer mom Moby licensing money. Instead, he ditched turntables for the microphone, signed to XL, and offered prayers to the mustache of John Oates. Meanwhile, meal tickets Cannibal Ox couldn't get it together for a sophomore album and were last seen wandering lost around the Gardens of Asgard.</p>
<p>That's a lot to deal with for any label head, let alone one tasked to redesign the Delorean every five years. It's hard enough to rap and make beats professionally, never mind having to worry about C-Rayz Walz wanting help with his 401(k). Factor in the ravages of online piracy and the tragic death of Camu Tao, and bombing the system seemed like the only obvious option. Yet what might've been most damning was that Def Jux became imprisoned by ideals that belonged to a different era. Even if most of their artists had long outgrown the ""Us vs. Them"" mentality, outside perception didn't always chart the progression.</p>
<p>By now, Eminem was making 12-step anthems for trailer trash.<i> Soundbombing II</i> star Common was allowed to wear angora and cinematically woo Queen Latifah with his low-post moves. But El-P and by proxy Definitive Jux were stereotyped with opinions like the one A$AP Worldwide co-founder Yams offered earlier this year: Company Flow fans don't buy A$AP Rocky records. Maybe that was true 10 years ago (if A$AP Rocky been out of Junior High), but the truth had become closer to El-P's response: I'm in Company Flow and I listen to A$AP. It was the rap equivalent of the Battle of New Orleans. The cease-fire had been signed, but there was one last conflict before putting the era to sleep.</p>
<p>With the exception of the Jay-Z/Kanye/Young Money/Rozay axis, the rap game has largely flattened out (or bottomed out, depending on your angle). A guy like Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire can get a deal from Universal after releasing a free mixtape over old Necro and El-P beats. Waka Flocka fronts this month's <i>XXL</i>, but Killer Mike and El-P get second billing alongside Chief Keef, Curren$y, and Slaughterhouse. 2Chainz is playing Rock the Bells. Things are more similar than they've seemed in a long time.</p>
<p><i>Cancer 4 Cure</i> is both reinvention and inversion. El-P's first album since putting Def Jux on hiatus in early 2010 marks a break from the old order and another call to arms. Whereas <i>Fantastic Damage</i> served as a Def Jux coming out party and <i>I'll Sleep When You're Dead</i> synthesized the sweaty jitters of the mid-Dubya daze, <i>Cancer 4 Cure</i> consciously creates its own iron galaxy. None of the Def Jukies appear, save for Despot. In their stead are eXquire, Danny Brown, and a snarling Killer Mike, whose El-P produced <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16537-killer-mike-rap-music/"" target=""_blank""><i>R.A.P. Music</i></a> is already the front-runner for rap album of the year. Any one of their guest spots could be a hip-hop quotable, if we still lived at a time when people cared about the Hip Hop Quotable. But my vote goes to Danny Brown, self-described as ""Ric Flair/ With thick hair/ Yelling out 'woo'/ Getting head in the director's chair.""</p>
<p><i>Cancer 4 Cure's</i> closest analogue may be Portishead's<i> Third</i>: the textures and tones are distinctly different from past releases, but it's unimaginable that it could be made by anyone else. El-P has described the record as fight music abstracted. To be more specific, it's fight or flight music. Primal response mechanism rap. And like any good storyteller, his narratives are rooted in conflict. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13521-tougher-colder-killer-ft-killer-mike-and-despot/"" target=""_blank"">""Tougher Colder Killer""</a>, El-P inhabits the mindset of a soldier haunted by post-traumatic stress, who made ""his enemy dig his own grave at the point of a gun."" ""For My Upstairs Neighbor"" finds the protagonist getting grilled by cops about a domestic violence situation in his apartment building. He tells ""Columbo"" nothing, but later confronts the abuse victim in the stairwell and whispers to her, ""do the thing you have to and I swear I'll tell them nothing."" Meanwhile, ""Works Every Time"" is a drug dealer dialectic between the urge to self-medicate and the consequences of the obliteration.</p>
<p>The closest thing the record has to a love song is ""The Jig Is Up"", where the hook uses the words of Groucho Marx to describe a relationship: ""I wouldn't want to be a part of any club that would have me."" Even ""Sign Here"", a song grappling with sexual power issues uses an interrogation room as a metaphorical backdrop. You don't need me tell you that it's heavy. It's a record from El-P, a man who could make Pollyanna see poltergeists. But to balance out the hangman's tension, there's ""Drones over BKLYN"" and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13299-the-full-retard/"" target=""_blank"">""The Full Retard""</a>, two clavicle-cracking rants reminiscent of the old El-P, with rhymes ""short and fat like Joe Pesci"" that would ""slap you out of your fucking shit.""</p>
<p>The beats. The synths sound like they've been stolen from a bargain bin on Alpha Centauri, stocked with futuristic workout anthems for robot soldiers. Listening to it in daylight hours can make you feel allergic to sunlight. Most rumble at 130 to 140 BPM and feel uniquely congruent with and ahead of the times. After all, the producers at L.A.'s Low End Theory and the early London dubstep architects all owe a small but significant debt to El's experiments with negative space and bone-chipping bass.</p>
<p>What grounds the record is a scarcely subliminated obsession with death. Dedicated to Camu Tao, whose demise directly preceded its creation, the characters are forever warring with some imminent end, whether creative, romantic, or literal. It's rare when re-inventions seem so deliberate but unselfconscious. And through the struggle it gains a certain scarred freedom. It's simultaneously able to stand alone but alongside that trademark blend of sneering New York City skepticism. It sheds the bullshit of the past and is stained with the weary residue of an incalculable number of cigarettes, weed deliveries, bodega runs, and blind turns. It's the best kind of tribute El-P could make: a record that you can pump like they do in the future.</p></div>"|16641.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16641-cancer-for-cure/|8.5|Jeff Weiss

That may sound like an unpalatable combo, but the Baltimore four-piece used each genre to subvert the other's worst tendencies. A swatch of Red Hot Chili Peppers homage could complicate the menace from a song stacked with splintering feedback. A few atonal squelches helped tweak a pummeling riff's macho momentum. The result was heavy music that possessed moments of levity but avoided parody. Now, perhaps weary of having Anthony Kiedis comparisons lobbed at them, Dope Body have backed away from the butt-rock influences. </p>
<p>On their follow up, <i>Natural History</i>, they've chilled out a bit. Maybe some of the mystical neo-Americana vibes championed by their new label, Drag City, have rubbed off on them. The first sound on the album isn't a blast of feedback but the tingling of wind chimes. That song, ""Shook"", lilts back and forth on a languid two-chord vamp with frontman Andrew Laumann grunting quasi-mystical pronouncements, striking closer to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2559-lungfish/"" target=""_blank"">Lungfish</a>'s Daniel Higgs than Zack de la Rocha. ""Crystallize the eyes/ Let them know you can feel it/ I feel it all around,"" he grunts.</p>
<p>Even in its most jittery, Nintendo-nostalgic moments, <i>Natural History</i> is a roomier effort than its predecessor. On <i>Nupping</i>, guitarist Zach Utz loaded songs with sonic belches and abstract gurgles. This time he's more selective with the audio-graffiti. His playing has taken a more melodic turn, incorporating elements from Holy Ghost Party, his tropical-psych guitar side project with Dope Body drummer David Jacober. On <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13512-weird-mirror/"" target=""_blank"">""Weird Mirror""</a> he plots out a pattern of robot-rock riffs that make the band sound like the Cars channeling San Francisco sci-fi proto-punk duo, Chrome. </p>
<p>Brutishness is still Dope Body's forte, though, and they haven't abandoned it. During the chorus to ""Road Dog"", Laumann gets inspirational, chanting the lines, ""Do what you want to do... Be who you want to be."" But he barks the words like a gym teacher on the edge of blowing his anger-management course, commanding listeners to either self-actualize or drop and give him 20. ""Out of My Mind"" churns like an off-center cement mixer, with a bassline that probably owes a few royalties to Soundgarden's ""Slaves and Bulldozers"".</p>
<p>It's one of the only flickers of 90s worship on <i>Natural History, </i>but there are still plenty of moments when the line between goofball antics and freakish punk-rock blowouts gets blurred. They may have changed up their game, but Dope Body still nail the sweet spot between savagery and self-awareness.</p></div>"|16638.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16638-natural-history/|7.9|Aaron Leitko

Chris Baio's bass playing is a key part of the band's signature rhythmic palette and always has a jaunty bounce to it. His first solo outing in the form of a short EP titled <i>Sunburn</i> not only feels connected to his playing in Vampire Weekend but also extends far from anything on his 9-to-5 band's records.</p>
<p>""Sunburn Modern"" relocates Vampire Weekend's staple West-African influence to somewhere around the Balearic islands. The skeleton of the song is made from a trio of lightly tapped bongos, balmy vocal stabs, and an electronic bassline that leaves heavy footprints. That bedrock is rhythmic with Baio teasing out all sorts of neat interplay around a 4/4 beat. The rest follows a deceptively simple format; keys track the slow but purposeful movements of the bass while whispering synth-strings provide a touch of melancholy for shading. The song isn't too far away from the ideas <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTPO6XM_IxM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Air France</a> were mining on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11933-no-way-down-ep/"" target=""_blank""><i>No Way Down</i></a>, and Baio achieves a similar vibe of sun-bleached bliss.</p>
<p>Despite the brevity of <i>Sunburn</i> (just three tracks) it's impressive how easily Baio puts down a marker. That he spends most of his time playing bass makes total sense in this context, too: each element on this record is consumed with rhythm and pacing. Even the big melody lines come from percussive instruments or sounds. Consider highlight <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13494-tanto-ft-matias-aguayo/"" target=""_blank"">""Tanto""</a>, for example: Steel drums drive its early momentum before Chilean vocalist and experimenter <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ziexgDAHYg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Matias Aguayo</a> opens things up with a characteristically choppy, rhythmic take full of depth and motion. Aguayo might not be singing anything in particular, but the gentle, precise movement of his chant-like vocal is both fun and strangely euphoric. The song truly approaches the point of bliss when Baio sweeps away the clutter halfway through, allowing those vocals, a dewy keyboard, and finger snaps to hang in the air for just a minute.</p>
<p>Baio's rhythmic approach comes undone on the EP's one weak spot, ""Anonymity"", showing there's still a little way to go for his solo efforts: The beats fall too straight, and the whole thing ends up feeling undercooked. That said, it's difficult to draw many conclusions from such a slim set of songs, and most of the time the humid fun of <i>Sunburn</i>'s best moments make for enjoyable, nicely transportive stuff.</p></div>"|16669.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16669-sunburn-ep/|7.2|Hari Ashurst

While many of its recent singles still toy with big grooves, crisp hi-hats, and deep rumble, its releases have taken on a sonic guise that's straightforwardly melodic and, at times, pink-hued and romantic. Last year saw the release of Braille and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2630-machine-drum/"" target=""_blank"">Machinedrum</a>'s self-titled debut LP as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16062-sepalcure/"" target=""_blank"">Sepalcure</a>, an adventurous record that explored sensual depths while appropriating sonic signifiers from assorted dance sub-genres; this year has brought the open-hearted second album from label head Paul Rose's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/23840-scuba/"" target=""_blank"">Scuba</a> project, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16341-personality/"" target=""_blank""><i>Personality</i></a>, as well as Scottish producer Beaumont's <i>Never Love Me</i> EP, which threw lush Italo synths into the mix and came adorned with the kind of artwork that <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15908-various-artists-drive/"" target=""_blank""><i>Drive</i></a> fetishists could get airbrushed onto the back of a leather jacket.</p>
<p>It makes sense, then, that Detroit producer and fashion photographer <a href=""http://jimmyedgar.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jimmy Edgar</a> is releasing his latest record, <i>Majenta</i>, on Rose's label, even if the team-up itself wasn't premeditated. (Edgar says this move came about after a dinner conversation with Rose and Sepalcure's Travis Stewart and Praveen Sharma.) As an under-30 with a career spanning more than a decade, Edgar's music strays just about as far from bass music proper as you can get. He works with a variety of sounds, from the type of techno that's closely associated with his hometown, to seedy, dank electro, to window-fogging, pitched-vocal R&amp;B. Dance music by definition is made to move bodies, and so is Edgar's-- only, in his case, in the type of way that could get someone slapped with lewdness charges.</p>
<p>That is to say, Jimmy Edgar is insatiable. He loves talking about sex, singing about sex, referencing sex. This is a man whose most notable track in his eight years with Warp was titled ""I Wanna Be Your STD"", and who called his last album <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14491-xxx/"" target=""_blank"">XXX</a> </i>(only after he decided to change it from its working title, <i>Deeper</i>). <i>Majenta</i> is similarly soaked in low-art sleaze; just scanning the tracklist (""Sex Drive"", ""Touch Yr Bodytime"", ""Hrt Real Good"", ""In Deep"") is enough to make you question whether you really want to hear what the <i>Majenta</i> cut ""This One's for the Children"" is all about. (Not to worry: it's just your run-of-the-mill ""Up with people, down with the system"" slice of Detroit techno.)</p>
<p>Suffice to say, Edgar really overdoes it on the sex stuff, moreso than on the other albums he's put out in the last decade. It's not that dance music can't be carnal, but that everyone's idea of what's ""sexy"" isn't the same, so presenting a specific expression of sexuality as a universal representation is a dangerous tightrope walk. At his core, Jimmy Edgar is a hippie, if a bit of a ridiculous-sounding one (he claims in the album's press release that he's recently ""made galactic contact with the community""), but the only way <i>Majenta</i> could bring people together is if they were convening to nervously giggle at Edgar's various trying-too-hard vocal turns, which come across as erotic as reading <i>Fifty Shades of Gray</i> on the subway.</p>
<p>Musically, <i>Majenta</i> initially seems better than <i>XXX</i>, only because the lack of uniformity that plagued the latter LP means that the former's standouts-- the warm, skipping vocal house of ""Let Yrself Be"", electro-bass near-twins ""Indigo Mechanix (3D)"", and ""In Deep""-- stand out that much more. Unfortunately, more than mediocre tracks or throaty sexual goofs, what does in <i>Majenta</i> is its scattershot nature. There's no flow to the way the album's sequenced, to the point where it seems purely arbitrary. Furthermore, Edgar seems so concerned about skipping between genres that he neglects to refine any one specific sound; even the strongest cuts rarely rise above ""nice try."" Edgar is clearly aiming for some sort of climax-- spiritually, musically, sexually-- but by the time <i>Majenta</i> sputters to a close, all he's left with is a mess on his hands.</p></div>"|16624.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16624-majenta/|5.2|Larry Fitzmaurice

After playing separately in a series of heavy Texas bands, they formed the fantastic shape-shifting doom-jazz group the Great Tyrant. The trio finished its sole album, <i>There's a Man in the House</i>, in 2008, but didn't unveil it until late last year via a largely overlooked limited vinyl release. That was too late for bassist Tommy Atkins, who killed himself in February 2010, leaving Teague and Beck to rearrange and relaunch their vicious blend of heavy metal and chamber rock as a duo. <a href=""http://pinkishblack.bandcamp.com/album/self-titled-lp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Pinkish Black</i></a> is the debut from their new sans-bass <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Pinkish-Black/138248106193659"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">duo of the same name</a>, itself a tender if morbid tribute to the color of the blood-spattered bathroom walls where Atkins' body was found. Still, despite the long-running and tangled partnership of its makers, this seven-track LP feels like a fresh start-- for better and worse. </p>
<p>Pinkish Black revolves around a convincing core identity of dense themes and dark imagery. At their best, these songs are thick, powerful thuds, with rubber band-like distorted bass from a keyboard growling between dynamic drums, teasing synthesizer lines, and vocals that push between operatic majesty and guttural infamy. ""Fall Down"" is the most systemic and convincing embrace of all of those features, with a sinister swing that recalls vintage <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4008-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Swans</a>. The duo thrusts in the verses beneath lines about inevitable failure, appropriately delivered with the fervor of an apocalypse prophet. In the chorus, there's a sense of relief that borders on Walker Brothers grandiosity; Teague eases back against the drums, and Beck lifts his voice, like a young Bruce Dickinson calling for help from a basement. ""Tell Her I'm Dead"" evokes a similar whiplash, snapping time and again between a hypnotic, stoner-metal groove; spasmodic <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3111-naked-city/"" target=""_blank"">Naked City</a> bursts; and a shrieking, knotty drone. Especially here, Teague and Beck sound impressively developed, especially for a relatively new duo. Their tones and timing are excellent, the work of two people who've collaborated long enough to know how they sound together in a room and, subsequently, on record.</p>
<p>But Teague and Beck seem uncommitted to that aforementioned anchor, a symptom that's perhaps a holdover from the Great Tyrant's stylistic sprawls. They pepper these tracks with distractions, as if to provide either a little levity or disruption on a set of songs that gain the most ground when they grind a tempo and tune into it. ""Tastes Like Blood"", for instance, opens with a piano-and-voice dirge about giving up, creating an unnecessary impasse between the perfectly belligerent ""Tell Her I'm Dead"" and the song's massive, nearly symphonic coda. It professes Pinkish Black's Scott Walker adoration explicitly, even though the band remains more compelling when that's a surprising accent of prettiness within the mire, not a substitute for it. ""Everything Went Dark"" begins with a short tape collage-- perhaps a Frank Zappa nod, but nevertheless a pointless hindrance to the genuinely hooky two-minute hit that follows. If the interlude has a purpose, it must be to convince Pinkish Black newcomers that they're more than an Om cover band; the mantric march that opens the album, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13394-bodies-in-tow/"" target=""_blank"">""Bodies in Tow""</a>, might have suggested otherwise.</p>
<p>What's best about <i>Pinkish Black</i>, then, is also what's least successful about the record: It plays like a music-nerd game of Name That Influence, where the proper answers range from Suicide and Rapeman to Gary Numan and Throbbing Gristle. It's a good LP with a lot of great moments, then, an album by a band that exudes promise and, in just one attempt, almost fulfills it. Think of these 34 minutes as a first trip to a cool new friend's house. They try to impress you with their cared-for record collection. The thrill of hearing new sounds, however, will almost inevitably be beset when the new pal overreaches or undershoots, mixing some stuff that doesn't actually belong with songs you've already heard plenty. In the end, maybe it will finally be be the start of something great.</p></div>"|16620.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16620-pinkish-black/|7.0|Grayson Currin

For folks who didn't fall into either camp, who were just looking for futuristic shocks or crazy rhythms, he was one of many artists around the turn of the millennium who seemed to treat dance music like a science-fiction movie, removing all the pesky plot and character development, until just the wild special effects highlights remained.</p>
<p><i>Ufabulum</i> comes many years and many albums after Squarepusher briefly enjoyed this kind of marginal pop culture recognition. His detractors have since found new things to hate, and his acolytes have weathered the various less-than-effective shifts in direction that come with following any long-running artist prone to frustrating whims. <i>Ufabulum </i>is in many ways a return to the angry-jazz-droids-run-amok vibe of his earliest stuff, and if people have forgotten (or never known) the whimsical-yet-punishing pleasures of Squarepusher's breakbeat chaos, might it be a good a place to get on board?</p>
<p>Yes and no, because it's also <i>exhausting</i> stuff, at least in large doses. This has always been a problem with Squarepusher's music, and <i>Ufabulum</i> is no different. Individual tracks can still induce a ""whoa!"" response from unsuspecting listeners. But at their best <i>and</i> their worst, Squarepusher's <i>albums</i> remind me of what video game fans call ""bullet hell"" games, shooters with an impossible density of enemies swarming at you at all times. Bullet hell games have an intensity that makes them initially mind-boggling (how can I process all this?) and quickly frustrating (why am I bothering to try and process all this?). Ditto Squarepusher's long-ish-players like <i>Hard Normal Daddy</i> and <i>Big Loada</i>.</p>
<p>That's why artists like Squarepusher, despite the refusal of rock-star posturing, were so perfect for that late 90s moment when MTV briefly discovered electronic music, and why their albums remained mostly for the serious fans. It's bracing stuff in three or four minute doses, immediately standing out amidst songs running at pop's usual pace, especially when paired with equally oddball and arresting barrages of imagery. Just like a casual player might play one or two levels of some fiendishly hard game, laughing with delight before hanging up the controller, singles are all most people need when it comes to dense swarms of breaks and zaps. As with those devoted arcade button-mashers, you're meant to delight in the complexity. If you don't, maybe it's not for you after all.</p>
<p>The endless explosions of Squarepusher tracks are similarly startling, at first, especially if you don't usually spend time with music this convoluted and hectic. He wastes no time on <i>Ufabulum</i>, immediately plunging the listener into antic, overlapping streams of chopped jazz snares and bass blurts. When opening track ""4001"" really kicks into gear, with an enveloping cascade of synth played against an almost head-banging drum and bass groove, it takes you back to the thrill and jolt of Jenkinson's earliest productions, where the already unreal speed of jungle was taken to truly inhuman velocities. The nagging worry is still there, though: How much of this am I going to be able to endure before I just get bored?</p>
<p>Part of the problem is tempo. Moments of <i>Ufabulum</i>, particularly the middle stretch, are all but impossible for me to remember after a dozen plays. Maybe there are brilliant ideas in the maelstrom, but I was left too numbed to pick them out. That's why it was great to hear Jenkinson try something new in the first third of <i>Ufabulum</i>, like pacing and funk and giving his ideas space to breathe. He immediately slows things down after ""4001"" with ""Unreal Square"", a typically perverse but still groove-friendly take on the half-time funk of dubstep. He can't resist spray-gunning that groove with caustic breaks at the very end, but at least the barrage feels more like an honest-to-god release of tension for a change.</p>
<p>""Stadium Ice"" is even better, prog-tronica every bit as overstuffed as anything on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15937-glass-swords/"" target=""_blank"">Rustie's <i>Glass Swords</i></a>, but with plenty of Jenkinson's own virtuoso jazz-fusioneer stamp. That's a sound he more or less bequeathed to IDM, of course, helping to make an aesthetic like Rustie's possible. ""Stadium Ice"" is as transportive a bit of audio world-building as Jenkinson's ever made, a track full of grand peaks that actually work because they follow relative lulls, sounding like all the best bits of old-school RPG soundtracks shoehorned into one track.</p>
<p>So it's frustrating that Jenkinson ditched this measured grandeur just as quickly. ""Stadium Ice"" hardly lacks that aforementioned ""whoa!"" factor. It's just infinitely friendlier and more replayable than the hyper-speed and assaultive stuff. It's hard to imagine an entire album in this vein wouldn't have been as whoa-worthy as <i>Glass Swords</i> itself, not only a brilliant reinvention but maybe Jenkinson's first must-listen since 1998. Once <i>Ufabulum</i> launches into overdrive again, it's not long before it becomes another for-fans-only deal.</p>
<p>Worse for those fans, Jenkinson actively seems to be pastiching <i>himself</i> in a few places. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13530-drax-2/"" target=""_blank"">""Drax 2""</a> and ""303 Scopem Hard"" are dead-ringers for the industrial-strength distortion and breakbeats-as-psych-warfare he was plumbing on 1997's virulent <i>Vic Acid</i> EP. But somehow they're duller, too, as if Jenkinson knew he was recycling once-vital stuff and couldn't be bothered to work up the appropriate intensity. Even if you're not immediately bummed out by artists replaying former glories, the least they can do is come hard with it, right?</p></div>"|16608.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16608-ufabulum/|6.3|Jess Harvell

The Swedish pop goliaths have been quietly protective of their legacy over the last three decades-- no reunions and tight archival control-- so the new song made headlines. Would ""From a Twinkling Star to a Passing Angel"" be an unreleased gem or a justly forgotten offcut? </p>
<p>Actually, it's neither; instead, it's a good argument as to why exactly there's nothing left in the vaults. The twee-est title in ABBA's, and possibly pop's history, hides a fascinating, carefully arranged montage showing the group's craftsmanlike side. They take album closer ""Like an Angel Passing Through My Room"" from its birth as a re-arrangement of ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" to its release as a twilit meditation on mortality. None of the many versions-- disco, nursery rhyme, strings-attached-- are as good as the final release. The medley seems designed to show both ABBA's punctilious approach to getting a track right, and their good judgement in knowing when they'd managed it. Even as the band's commercial star faded and its professional relationships quietly unravelled, they were perfectionists.</p>
<p>ABBA's music on <i>The Visitors</i> is more pristine and ambitious than it had ever been, its themes darker, its personal politics more tangled. Both of the band's couples had divorced, but the men were still writing lyrics for the women to sing-- meaning it's easy to see a cruel edge in tracks like ""One of Us"", in which a woman regrets her new independence over a typically gorgeous melody. All of this has made <i>The Visitors</i> a perennial critic's favorite. It's the record on which the wintry melancholy of ""late ABBA""-- whose sadness had bubbled under their music almost from the start-- could finally dominate.</p>
<p>But things are never quite so simple. The original nine tracks that make up <i>The Visitors</i> are no less uneven than any ABBA full-length; in fact, the weakest songs are a snapshot of their foibles as a group. They had a long dalliance with musical theatre-- the pomp-pop fantasia ""I Let the Music Speak"" is their last and most bloated attempt. ""Two for the Price of One""-- a hokey story of a failed threesome-- calls back to their earliest, goofiest records. ""Slipping Through My Fingers"", about the impotence of watching your kids grow up, is a great example of how the group had come to pitch records at adults, but in execution it's pure schmaltz.</p>
<p>The highs, though, are astonishing. The title track is a snapshot of life in a totalitarian state, full of justified paranoia and exhausted fatalism: ""I hear the doorbell ring"" it begins matter-of-factly ""and suddenly the panic takes me."" The music lurches between seasick synth-pop and nervous disco flourishes, with Frida Lyngstad's raga-infuenced vocals rolling uneasily on top. It's five years and a musical lifetime since this band sung ""Dum Dum Diddle"", but for all its distance from ABBA's traditional sound, ""The Visitors"" never gives up on catchiness. This is grown-up, risk-taking pop, but always pop nonetheless. </p>
<p class=""p1"">The same goes for the record's other strong songs-- the ghostly ""Like an Angel Passing Through My Room"", the cryptic ""Soldiers"", the wise and sympathetic ""When All Is Said and Done"". Aurally, too, the group was never better: <i>The Visitors</i> is deliciously crisp, layered, and rewarding where a lot of contemporary synth-pop now sounds rather thin. Some of the band's latter-day weaknesses have been ironed out-- their rather awkward relationship with disco, for instance. Their ""disco LP,"" <i>Voulez-Vous</i>, was marked by a noticeable stiffness: By the time of <i>The Visitors</i> ABBA hadn't got any funkier, but they had learned to use their unyielding rhythms creatively, turning their dance-pop into something intriguingly angular and staccato on ""I Am the City"" and ""You Owe Me One"".</p>
<p>Those songs are both included on the reissue as bonus tracks-- indeed <i>The Visitors</i>' set of bonus material is uniformly terrific, turning a fine album into a great one. ""Cassandra"", like ""The Visitors"", is a cryptic sketch of unspecified political disaster, given devastating dignity by Frida's measured vocals. ""Under Attack"" and ""I Am the City"" are clockwork jewel boxes of hooks. ""Should I Laugh or Cry"", a puncturing of a pompous husband and dead marriage, takes all the spite of their famous divorce songs and turns it back on the men to wounding effect. And-- leaving out ""From a Twinkling Star""'s exercise in archaeology-- <i>The Visitors</i> ends with career highlight ""The Day Before You Came"", Agnetha singing a woman's hesitant reconstruction of the day before she met someone we assume is her lover. The details are banal, but Agnetha makes them live anyway, and they're contrasted by keening backing vocals of such dread that it's been speculated the song's ""You"" is killer, not partner.</p>
<p class=""p1"">""The Day Before You Came"" is, on paper, a happier song than ""The Visitors"", but it shares its themes with much of the album: Life is unstable, happiness may be fleeting, and your world can be instantly and forever overturned. These are strong, resonant ideas to end a career on, and this is an excellent way to finish-- a band and a record divided between almost throwaway studio mastery and spectral, uneasy premonitions of their own demise.</p></div>"|16577.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16577-the-visitors-deluxe-edition/|8.6|Tom Ewing

With expectations comes pressure, and pressure in rap means to repeatedly prove one's commercial potential in a genre largely starved for continuous hits. Meek is a street rapper who's beginning to answer to executives, and the new <i>Dreamchasers 2 </i>is his first mixtape that reflects that. Gone are the first volume's guests like Beanie Sigel and Young Chris, stylistically similar rappers from Meek's hometown of Philadelphia that have instead been traded for the likes of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27950-drake/"" target=""_blank"">Drake</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10706-trey-songz/"" target=""_blank"">Trey Songz</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27696-big-sean/"" target=""_blank"">Big Sean</a>. The connection to the latter group doesn't go far beyond occupying the same tax bracket, but the strength of <i>D2 </i>is that in collaborating with those artists (and guys like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10147-wale/"" target=""_blank"">Wale</a>) Meek is still able to tip the scales in his favor. He doesn't so much step out of his own world as merge it with the one that he's about to enter, and the result is a mixtape that will continue his forward momentum even if it doesn't fulfill the wild expectations of some fans.</p>
<p>Not that everything here goes smoothly. ""Take U Home"" and ""Face Down"", both of which sport a Wale verse to go along with help from Big Sean for the former and Trey Songz for the latter, roll off the assembly line and into the trash heap. The good news is that those are the exceptions, and the frontloaded first half of the mixtape lays out the blueprint for what a great Meek Mill major-label debut album would look like. Most notably there's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13577-amen-ft-drake-and-jeremih/"" target=""_blank"">""Amen""</a>, a track that uses gospel and the soft coos of singer Jeremih to spin 2012's version of Kanye's ""Good Life"". Meek's celebratory hook is perfectly left-field, and it's here that he shows that he's potentially capable of taking his sound back to the radio without veering straight into predictable soft-serve R&amp;B. There are also two tracks where Meek pulls outside rappers into his world and draws out top-notch work. The first, ""Burn"", is maybe the best song on the mixtape-- it should be noted that this is the other Big Sean song, and if Big Sean is on the best song of Meek's pretty good mixtape, that means Meek is doing something really right. The other is ""A1 Everything"", where Meek calls in Kendrick Lamar for an atypically cocky, swaggering verse.</p>
<p>There are good tracks up and down the tape here, but in attempting to streamline his sound, Meek shows that he's still striving for overall tonal coherence. Songs like ""The Ride"" and ""Use to Be"" are two of the best on the tape, but their introspection feels like a pittance amongst the barrage of bangers and big names. There are also songs like ""Racked Up Shawty"" and ""Str8 Like That"" that feature <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7480-fabolous/"" target=""_blank"">Fabolous</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30094-french-montana/"" target=""_blank"">French Montana</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30336-2-chainz/"" target=""_blank"">2 Chainz</a> that could've come off of any mixtape by basically any popular rapper in the past two years. But, in a way, mixtapes are made for throwing out songs and seeing what sticks-- if Meek can put whatever feedback he gets to good use, it will make his impending big box debut stronger. Sure, the tape would be better if a handful of its tracks were cut, but it arguably would've been a misuse of the form.</p>
<p>If all goes well for Meek Mill, <i>Dreamchasers 2 </i>will be a footnote in his career, the tape where he started to bridge the gap to something close to stardom. It won't play as important a role in his narrative as the first edition, and that's saying something considering <i>D2 </i>currently sits at 2.8 million downloads on DatPiff alone. But it is of equal quality to the mixtape that broke him big, and that can only mean good things.</p></div>"|16614.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16614-dreamchasers-2/|7.4|Jordan Sargent

Who knows why. Perhaps it's because the cartoonish nihilism of each is so inherently in conflict with functioning in actual life, that it's silly to hold someone to the standard of ""keeping it real."" Or maybe they attract fans with a greater capacity to understand and appreciate camp. The latter possibility appears more relevant to keep in mind while negotiating the Brooklyn trio's emboldened attitude towards extremism on <i>every </i>front; it's easier to hit the kill switch if you don't have to explain your intentions after the fact. RØSENKØPF roughly translates to ""redhead"" in English, but isn't the perverted Teutonic spelling about 12 billion times more intimidating? That part's easy. But those shrieking black-metal vocals and goofy radio speeches? Their post-<i>Neuromancer </i>dress code? All part of the package deal, I suppose. <i>Selective </i>extremity would be kind of a cop-out.</p>
<p>The last of those is actually fairly crucial to understanding RØSENKØPF's party at ground zero; the music indeed operates on some kind of post-apocalyptic junkyard level, the band acting as scavengers utilizing some of the past two decade's best intros as energy-dense fossil fuels. By my count, there's Massive Attack's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbe3CQamF8k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Angel""</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12093-the-great-pan-is-dead/"" target=""_blank"">""The Great Pan Is Dead""</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11671-we-want-war/"" target=""_blank"">""We Want War""</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSvFpBOe8eY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Chop Suey!""</a>, and, of course, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD-E-LDc384"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Enter Sandman""</a>. This is a wholly unscientific process, so you'll pick something else out of the scrapheap, but it's worth noting that all of those songs are taken from intricate and expensively produced records. Even though it culls from scare-quote scary templates ranging from Wax Trax! to Tri Angle, <i>RØSENKØPF </i>remains a penetrable and accessible listen throughout, rhythmic music that hits with brute muscle rather than harsh abrasion. Attribute it to a musicality that inverts typical roles: The guitars and bass all but abandon melody, either churning violently or functioning as looms for sheets of white noise, subservient to the ever-present and hyperactive percussion. But it's all well-proportioned and slick, like hearing Brooklyn noise all-stars <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1831-gang-gang-dance/"" target=""_blank"">Gang Gang Dance</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2469-liars/"" target=""_blank"">Liars</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/366-black-dice/"" target=""_blank"">Black Dice</a> in their earliest incarnations but given their current production budgets.</p>
<p>If never truly danceable, it's an intensely physical experience due to the heavy and righteous emphasis on the drums. For the most part, there's a clatter of unusually pitched cymbals and snare shrapnel at the forefront, but this is probably the first time I've heard rock music using 808s as a lead instrument, and it's pretty fucking cool. As such, RØSENKØPF's music doesn't take you on a journey so much as build narrow monuments out of scrap metal that are only meant to hold for five minutes at a time. The real thrills aren't provided via hooks so much as the point where each track teeters most perilously on collapse. Those are typically the times when this music gets closest to passing for instrumentals from the kind of bands scoring serious MTV play after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3043-nine-inch-nails/"" target=""_blank"">Nine Inch Nails</a> broke big. But for better or worse, what separates this from the God Lives Underwaters and Gravity Killses of the world are <span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 16px;"">Søren Roi's</span> vocals, which are clearly meant to chase the squares away, but always just sound... <i>off </i>instead of truly frightening<i>. </i>I feel like something more Cookie Monster or Zombie Ian Curtis would've fit better aesthetically than the shrill, reptilian hiss favored by Roi, but as a whole, vocals of any sort are a problem area. The first half of ""Heed"" is punctuated with a hilarious, <i>Mortal Kombat-</i>style ""OMEGA!"" (alternate genre name, Sega Teenage Riot) while the preacher-revolutionary recording that plays throughout ""Human Love Song"" (""You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men!"") suggest a band that took <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2780-ministry/"" target=""_blank"">Ministry</a> a little too seriously for its own good.</p>
<p>But I suppose RØSENKØPF aren't about doing the most tasteful thing to begin with. The point isn't to determine whether ""Troth"" should've continued its surprisingly gorgeous, post-rock churn instead of taking a jarring turn into digital hardcore or whether they can <i>really </i>pull off spot-welding half-time surf rock, witch house, Built to Spill-style guitar solos, dancehall beats, and black metal vocals within the span of two minutes during ""Heed"". The point is that RØSENKØPF are willing to try-- and indeed, for a record that goes for such an exaggerated scorched-earth feel, it's understandable that they're a band that sounds like they're in survival mode, learning the lay of the land on a minute-by-minute basis. It'll be really interesting to see what happens if they settle in next time around.</p></div>"|16648.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16648-rsenkpf/|7.6|Ian Cohen

It's helpful because it's good not to have to invoke a description with that many slashes. It's disorienting because there already was a movement called ""bass music"" decades back, modified by qualifiers like ""Miami"" or ""booty."" So the simultaneous incorporation of both bass musics feels a bit like some kind of inevitable ""well, duh"" streamlining. Frenetic 808s know no borders, and it's not like the connection was ever deliberately obscured. When <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/DISTALDUB"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Distal</a> emerged from Atlanta with a grip of Southern hip-hop-tinged releases smartly engineered to connect those dots-- ""Apple Bottom"", ""Eel"", ""Boss of the South""-- the only real surprise about his M.O. was how quick he could evolve.</p>
<p><i>Civilization</i>, Distal's first full-length for Tectonic, is one of those albums that feels like a rapid succession of new-direction singles gathered together as an overarching summary of a growing artist. It's also expectation-defying in a very deliberate way. From the outset, leadoff track ""The Sun"" pushes a red-herring swath of blatant throwback acid house that nimbly clambers its way toward something more gauzy and abstract and modern. It feels like some kind of good-natured poke at the idea of hitting one obvious signifying nostalgia button, especially in following that bit with a whole album dedicated to seamless juxtapositions.</p>
<p>Paying homage without preserving everything in amber has been par for the course in bass music, refreshing an outlook as that might be. So there's other things that set Distal's music apart as its own thing worth isolating and following. His drum programming is often nothing short of diabolical, riding off crisp snare/kick/bass interplay that never feels overstuffed. At its best, it splits the difference between rock-solid, danceable beat programming and the percussive transcript of a wushu swordfight, steady momentum switched up with fake-out feints and advantageous jabs into open space. </p>
<p>And while there's a lot of pull to the tracks that go all-out one way or another -- the space-horror lurch of ""Gorilla""; the tense, cavernous footwork of ""Boca Ratawan""; the ghettotech jackhammer ""Drop Like This""; the LTD/Lincoln Town Car/Eldorado funk of ""Feed Me""-- the tracks that really jump out are the ones where polarized moods are pitted against each other. Or with each other, more accurately. Coating its trunk-rattle beat with soaring <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3169-the-orb/"" target=""_blank"">Orb</a>-caliber ambient whooshes makes ""Preach on Hustle"" sound both amped up and daydream-prone. While ""Temple People"" is otherwise occupied with signifying deadpan cool via Rakim samples and intensely choppy kicks, a tinkly electric piano riff sneaks in to add some lightheartedness. And it's a hell of a capper to dredge up some sax-and-Rhodes smooth jazzisms for ""She Wears Pearls"", then slyly revealing the percussive element to be a torrential downpour of drumline rolls.</p>
<p><i>Civilization</i> is a record that evokes so many eras and moods at once in parallel that there's a deliberate possibility of the listener losing track of all the sonic attributions. Is that drum pattern in ""House Party Five"" closer to UGK or Boxcutter? Are those sweeping, oscillating synths in ""Not Cool"" meant to pay homage to vintage techno or recent ""purple"" dubstep? Is that subtle integration of the ""Funky Drummer"" break in ""Venom"" inspired by 1988 hip-hop or 1993 jungle? Where do we set the dance music wayback machine, anyways? None of those questions gets a clear answer, but if you ask whether that stylistic lineage even matters, the response is a question in itself: Won't you have an easier time dancing after you pull that stick out your ass?</p></div>"|16655.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16655-civilization/|7.7|Nate Patrin

The former is all sneering, lapsed-Catholic angst (on <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb7fLA5ccWg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Vow""</a>, a scorned Shirley Manson compares herself to ""Jesus Christ coming back from the dead"" and utters the words like they're curdling in her mouth) and dark sensuality (""This is what he pays me for,"" she breathes on the early single ""Queer"", ""I'll show you how it's done""). <i>Version 2.0</i> focused even more on internal demons: There's the forlorn ""Medication"", the asphyxial trip-hop of ""Hammering in My Head"", and the feel-good anxiety disorder anthem of the 90s, ""I Think I'm Paranoid"". Duke Erikson, Steve Marker, and Butch Vig supplied the sort of relentlessly keyed-up, cranked-to-11 racket you get with a band full of producers, matching Manson's macabre with a persistent sense of unease. ""When I grow up, I'll be stable,"" went the optimistic refrain of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVo69yUncow"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">one of their bigger radio hits</a>, but those familiar with the deep cuts knew that was wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Garbage reigned in the late-period glory days of alternative-rock radio, probably because their sound was a hectic amalgamation of almost everything that mingled on the format's airwaves: electronica, punk, industrial rock, grunge, and the occasional trip-hop. But given the recent decline of the alt-rock format, the radio station on which you first heard Garbage's big hits probably changed formats years ago. So when Garbage entered the studio to record <i>Not Your Kind of People</i>, their first release in seven years, they faced a conundrum that many other artists who found success in the alt-rock-crazed 90s are dealing with, too: Do you update your approach to conform to a more contemporary sound? Or do you say fuck it and just party like it's 1998?</p>
<p>We got a hint of Garbage's answer earlier this year, when Manson called off plans for a solo album because her label wanted it to have a poppier, more radio-ready sound. (""Too noir,"" Geffen Records said of the demos. When she later scrapped the record, she issued a public statement: ""We had the funeral…it made such a beautiful corpse that we had an open casket."") And, indeed, <i>Not Your Kind of People</i> is in some respects a return to form for Garbage. The material is tighter and more kinetic than their last two records, the relatively tepid <i>Beautiful Garbage</i> (2001) and <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3397-bleed-like-me/"" target=""_blank"">Bleed Like Me</a> </i>(2005). There's the exhilarating opener ""Automatic System Habit"", which finds Manson spitting venom over a steely crunch of keyboards and percussion (""Not for you, not for me, not for your other lover/ I won't be your dirty little secret."") On the gentler side, there's the lush ""Felt"", which buries her vocals under an avalanche of arena-sized <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16059-gish-deluxe-edition-siamese-dream-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank""><i>Siamese Dream</i></a> guitars. It's a soothing moment on the otherwise pummeling record but, characteristically, Manson can't help but sound a little sinister as she sings, ""They're only feelings, baby.""</p>
<p>Growing up hasn't made Garbage any more stable. Their music is still focused primarily on pain and darkness, so much so that it occasionally feels rote, as on the melodramatic, predictable ""I Hate Love"". Then there's the unfortunate finale ""Beloved Freak"", a brooding ballad that ends with Manson reprising ""This Little Light of Mine"". It's a moment that aims for catharsis but veers into the maudlin. Though not without highlights, <i>Not Your Kind of People</i><span> contains nothing as memorable as their big hits, and it's heavier on the filler than their earlier albums.</span></p>
<p>The great irony of alternative rock was how relative that term is; as Thomas Frank once asked in the title of an essay about the whole phenomenon, ""Alternative to What?"" In the mid-to-late 90s, Garbage didn't feel so much in opposition to the times as they did a frenzied synthesis of everything that was happening in rock at the moment. That'd be a harder task to accomplish now, in more sonically diffuse times, but now-ness is no longer Garbage's aim. ""It's not our job to reinvent the wheel,"" Manson said in a recent interview, reflecting on the new album. ""That's the playground of the young."" So <i>Not Your Kind of People</i> is a statement from a band that's stuck, combatively, to its guns. The times have changed but Garbage haven't, and now, for better and for worse, they've at last become alternative to everything.</p></div>"|16606.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16606-not-your-kind-of-people/|6.4|Lindsay Zoladz

Like its contemporaries <i>De La Soul Is Dead</i>,<i> Check Your Head</i>,<i> The Chronic</i>, and <i>Midnight Marauders</i>, <i>Bizarre Ride </i>deserves to be heard in order, skits and all, for its full world-creating effects to be understood and felt. It needs to start with J-Swift's brief jazz-club intro, and end with the Doug E. Fresh throwback ""Return of the B-Boy"". You should expect <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJunijzmjks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Otha Fish""</a> to come after <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAfrhmIvZ_s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Passin' Me By""</a>, and for the ""um, um, well excuse me""s to come directly after the belched-out ""duhhhh"" that ends <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3RS_agsrPc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""4 Better or 4 Worse""</a>. You need to know that on their debut album, the same skinny stoners who freestyle a paean to the periodic visits of their outsize ex-con weed-provider Quinton were also world-wise enough to acknowledge the reality of rap music in the early 1990s-- ""You're rappin' for the white man/ It's jigaboo time""-- and use ""Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos"" as the jump-off for a tragicomic tale of the perils of driving around young, black, and unlicensed in Daryl Gates' Los Angeles. Nearly two decades after it was released, <i>Bizarre Ride</i>'s dizzying mix of SoCal 420 culture, jazzy bohemianism, self-conscious rap smarts and postmodern pop-cult potpourri<i> </i>is still as entertaining and emotionally satisfying as ever, and with the benefit of hindsight, stands as a perfect snapshot of rap's rapid, diverse ascent to pop status in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>For fans of a certain age, however, the Pharcyde box-- released last month by Delicious Vinyl as a Record Store Day exclusive-- is a worthwhile throwback collectible for completists. It contains the album's five singles as multicolored 7"" records (two each of the canonized <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgXkwiM0hIQ&amp;list=PLD9245267EE0FE047&amp;index=7&amp;feature=plpp_video"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Ya Mama""</a>, and ""Passin' Me By"", plus ""Soul Flower"", ""Otha Fish"", and ""4 Better or 4 Worse""), each packaged with the original art. It comes with a fold-out poster of the roller-coaster album art, a direct line back to both ""Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids"" and Overton Loyd's outlandish comic-book mythologies for Parliament's <i>Motor Booty Affair</i> and <i>Funkentelechy vs. the Placebo Syndrome</i>. The box fits perfectly on a bookshelf, and it even plays ""Oh Shit"" when you open it. <a href=""http://youtu.be/WhTQXTngo3E?t=7s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Real dope, on the real</a>. But anyway...</p>
<p>Released six months after the L.A. riots, <i>Bizarre Ride </i>is most often contrasted with the militarized West Coast gangsta rap that was terrifying conservative pundits and suburban parents at the time. Reality, of course, is more complicated. While the Pharcyde were featured on the <i>Marauders</i> album cover and shared more of a worldview with the heady Hieroglyphics collective than what was emanating from L.A. at the time, it's important to remember that they were embraced across the rap spectrum-- their first tours included opening slots for Ice Cube and 2Pac. They came together in South Central, a section of Los Angeles that John Singleton's <i>Boyz n the Hood</i> had taken to Hollywood in summer 1991, and which cable news had been publicizing to the world through its helicopter-bound journalistic sniper scope for months.</p>
<p>Their experience of South Central came from a slightly different perspective, however. L.A. club dancers Tre Hardson, Imani Wilcox, and Romye Robinson met rapper/producer Derrick Stewart and John Martinez, the talented son of a jazz musician, at an arts-centric after-school program called South Central Unit. Run by Reggie Andrews, an R&amp;B producer-turned-teacher, SCU was the foundation of the Pharcyde. When they weren't digging through the mounds of old jazz and rock records in Andrews' garage, they worked out routines and adopted stage names: Hardson became SlimKid Tre, Wilcox turned into Imani, Robinson adopted Bootie Brown, Stewart became Fatlip, and Martinez, the group's svengali producer, would be known as J-Swift. Before long, the quintet moved in together in a big house on on West 24th and South Budlong, on the outskirts of South Central. They called it Pharcyde Manor.</p>
<p>Their 1991 demo, recorded mostly in SCU, included a rough version of their first single ""Ya Mama"". A kaleidoscopic take on the dozens, one of the oldest African-American traditions, it feels less like folklore and more like a direct transmission from a blunt-hazed living room with ""The Simpsons"" on mute in the background. Over an Al Kooper organ loop and the ""Synthetic Substitution"" drums, each of the four members one-ups the others with outlandish, nonsensical snaps that perfectly capture kids teetering on the precipice of adulthood, and which remarkably remain funny 20 years later. ""Ya mama looks like she's been in a dryer with some rocks,"" ""what a pity, got a glass titty, filled up with Kool-Aid, just for the kiddies,"" ""ya mama's got a wooden leg with real feet,"" and Fatlip's richly detailed capper: ""she was beatboxin' for Lou Rawls, in some bright red boxer drawers."" A hit in June 1992, ""Ya Mama"" could easily have been the gimmick-rap alpha and omega of the group's career.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that same demo also had ""Officer"" and ""Passin' Me By"", on it, completing a triptych perfectly outlining the group's penchant for virtuosic dicking around with a roguish, melancholic take on cops and girls. ""Passin'"" is the song that caught the ear of Mike Ross, co-owner of the upstart L.A. rap label Delicious Vinyl that had brought pop rap to the mainstream in 1989 with Tone-Loc's ""Wild Thing"" and Young MC's ""Bust a Move"". He signed the group on the spot, giving them full creative control on their first LP.</p>
<p>You don't need me to tell you this, but ""Passin'"" is an absolute masterpiece, the too-smart-by-half class clowns ruminating on their romantic insufficiencies. It's the group's biggest hit, and the primary reason to call <i>Bizarre</i> ""one of the most joyously heartbreaking albums ever,"" as Ernest Hardy did. Powered by Fatlip's impassioned howl on the chorus (which J-Swift claims in the box-set liners was a playful Jim Morrison impression arising from <i>The Doors</i> playing at the crib), ""Passin'"" is half-rapped, half-sung soul music made by a group of kids remarkably unafraid of seeming uncool or wussy. Fatlip emerges as the star, singing the hook and delivering one of rap's all-time greatest climax verses. It opens with the lovely bit of lyrical hopscotch ""now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian,"" and concludes with two bars that firmly situate the song in a litany of pop sentiment, nodding toward <a href=""http://www.lorenzhart.org/yours_s.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rodgers &amp; Hart</a>, and sending <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZBUb0ElnNY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z54-QHEZN6E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shouts</a> to Elvis at his most lovelorn. Buffeted by high rotation on ""Yo! MTV Raps"" and BET's ""Rap City"", the song's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjsPG0Kspxo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">arty black and white video</a> (which Ross recalls being beat out by Onyx's ""Slam"" as MTV's one regular-rotation rap clip) made the Pharcyde a hit with rap fans and Buzz Bin acolytes alike. ""If we got that MTV slot,"" Ross remembers, ""I can only imagine how big that song would have gotten.""</p>
<p>Yet while ""Passin'"" is the group's canonical classic single, ""Otha Fish"" is the Pharcyde's best song. Back to back on <i>Bizarre Ride</i>, the two constitute one of the greatest 10-minute stretches in rap history, and it's exactly this sort of artful expression of romantic doubt and anguish that separates them from the 1992 rap class-- hell, from the 2012 rap class. Where Fatlip shone brightly on ""Passin'"", SlimKid Tre proves to be the Pharcyde's best rapper here, absorbing the spotlight with three fluid verses of splendid remorse. Over the high, lonesome saxophone lick from <a href=""http://youtu.be/jkd8M8qhidA?t=12s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Herbie Mann's ""Today""</a>, Tre effortlessly bridges the emotional chasm between Marvin Gaye's ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" (""why ain't you climbin' up?"") and <i>Here, My Dear</i>'s ""When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You?"" Kevin Kerslake's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJunijzmjks"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video for the track</a> didn't do much to assist the vibe, though its aesthetic similarity to his <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEnwU5UGVYs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Come As You Are"" clip</a> got the attention of Alternative Nation (they'd play Lollapalooza in '94). Along with ""Passin'"", I'm convinced that ""Otha Fish"" is the key to Kanye West's naming <i>Bizarre Ride</i> <a href=""http://youtu.be/R7BJS8x8o8I?t=1m47s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">his favorite album ever</a>. He's yet to record anything quite as open-hearted and vulnerable about the opposite sex, though. </p>
<p>""We're serious about certain things, but everything is basically a joke. We live through hard shit, but we can laugh about it."" Tre told <i>Rolling Stone</i> in 1993. This dialectic encapsulates the group's perspective perfectly, which is on full display across the second and last singles from  <i>Bizarre Ride</i>, ""Soul Flower"" and ""4 Better or For Worse"". The former track was written for the group's first release, the finale of Delicious Vinyl's Brand New Heavies coming-out party <i>Heavy Rhyme Experience Vol. 1, </i>which paired the UK funk group with some of the hippest of the '92 rap class--Gang Starr, Masta Ace, Black Sheep, and Kool G. Rap. The remix from <i>Bizarre Ride</i> is better than the Heavies version (which the box set doesn't include anyway). It's the group at its giddy best, freely mixing James Brown's ""Soul Power"" with a refrain copped from the Jetsons and a final line that turns <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSfy4AhDDnw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Announcement</a> into an eye-popping opportunity for a hilariously personal confession. The track for ""4 Better or 4 Worse"" is J-Swift at his best-- it's mostly his own keyboard work-- though as is his wont, Fatlip steals the show at the end of the group's darkest moment. If you want to trace <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15413-goblin/"" target=""_blank"">Tyler, the Creator's <i>Goblin</i></a> back to a single source, well, you could do much worse than his nasty, prank-calling-a-girl-he-likes verse (which was freestyled in the studio). It's creepy, but far from nihilistic: the immediate ""okaaaay, I think we've gone a little bit overboard..."" response brings things immediately back to reality, like a news reporter properly recontextualizing a live-shot gone awry.</p>
<p><i>Bizarre Ride</i> would go gold by 1996, but the band's own dissolution-- typical inter-squad bickering and ""creative differences""-- would start before the album was even released. J-Swift would abandon the group before the next album, <i>Labcabincalifornia</i> (they hooked up instead with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7Q_EwNz67Y"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a promising kid named Jay Dee</a>), and a nasty crack addiction would trigger a sad spiral from which he's still recovering. <i>Labcabin</i> was a very good album, but it also came at the start of the dizzying, dark mook-rock moment in the late 90s, which would wind up with the band opening for Korn (and Tre later dropping a guest verse on 1999's <i>Follow the Leader</i>). It's hard to kick ""Somethin' That Means Somethin'"" in one of the most aggro, apolitical times in pop's history. The Pharcyde's lack of a followup to <i>Bizarre Ride</i> isn't a slight against the band's legacy at all, but much more a testament to the incredible capacity of five kids to refract a politically and culturally tumultuous era into a work that, remarkably, transcends its context.</p></div>"|16595.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16595-the-pharcyde-bizarre-ride-ii-the-pharcyde-20th-anniversary-box-set/|8.8|Eric Harvey

Compared to previous peaks, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4926-necrophones/"">Necrophones</a></i> felt subdued, at times even tired, as if the Baltimore quartet was walking where it used to sprint. Heard in vacuum, their repetitive post-punk was still solid, and their hard-won personality still shone through. But that personality was also a bit of a curse, because anyone interested in Lungfish knew what they were capable of, and would quickly judge them by that standard-- especially because one of their best albums, <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15592-the-unanimous-hour/"">The Unanimous Hour</a></i>, was released just the year before.</p>
<p>If hearing <i>Necrophones </i>in a vacuum was tough then, it's pretty much impossible now that Dischord has released <i>A.C.R. 1999</i>. Recorded in a 1999 session with Craig Bowen at Baltimore's A.C.R. studios, it includes six songs that were later re-made for <i>Necrophones</i>, heard here in sharper, more muscular form. More significantly, where <i>Necrophones</i> darted around in ways both good and bad, this sounds like the work of a single, honed band with a single, committed vision. Not coincidentally, <i>A.C.R. 1999 </i>is more visceral and more live-sounding-- you can easily imagine Lungfish breaking a sweat and commanding a crowd with these churning tunes.</p>
<p>The heightened flow is clear immediately. ""Eternal Nightfall"", which played as a moody instrumental near the end of <i>Necrophones</i>, works better here as an opening warm-up for the calisthenics to come. From there the album hews to constant forward motion, varied in tempo but unwavering in energy. The songs that didn't end up on <i>Necrophones </i>are the most energetic: ""Symbiosis"" boasts a weight-lifting rhythm and urgent <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28898-daniel-higgs/"">Daniel Higgs</a> vocal, and ""Screams of Joy"" follows with almost exactly the same combination.</p>
<p>Such consistency may be why there are few transcendent moments on <i>A.C.R. 1999. </i>But there are also no letdowns, and more memorable than any individual song is Lungfish's workmanlike, near-religious devotion to their music. That's most apparent in Higgs' lyrics, whose simple, repetitive lines are drenched in allegorical imagery. ""The shifting sands/ Of the eroding coast/ whisper Holy Ghost,"" he croons during ""I Will Walk Between You"". In ""Symbiosis"", he strips things down further, singing just four lines-- ""The Christ is sucked/ At the devil's breast/ The devils is suckled/ At the Christ's breast""-- while a cyclical melody mimics his conceptual loop.</p>
<p>That kind of streamlined efficiency persists throughout <i>A.C.R. 1999</i>, bringing to mind something Higgs said a year before this material was recorded. ""We'd like to do as much as we can do with the same old instruments we've been using,"" he <a href=""http://www2.citypaper.com/story.asp?id=13921"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told</a> <i>Baltimore City Paper</i>. ""There's a temptation to bring in all kinds of crazy new sounds but ultimately, we'll stick with the guitars and drums."" On <i>Necrophones </i>that hardline began to sound like a fault, but on <i>A.C.R. 1999</i> Lungfish show once again how stubbornness can be a virtue.</p></div>"|16621.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16621-acr-1999/|7.4|Marc Masters

The first piece on the New York string quartet's latest solo record, by Don Byron, is called ""Four Thoughts on Marvin Gaye"": All four of Byron's thoughts on Marvin Gaye, it turns out, are violent. His first movement deposits us in the midst of a furious scrabble; it's unclear what's happening, but it's urgent. It's possible that several cats are fighting several dogs. The quartet attack a descending figure in lockstep unison, one with a difficult-to-track time signature. If you attempted to conduct it, you might trip and fall. Seconds in, the figure evaporates: The violins peel off into glass shards, and the cello starts moaning. It's a relief from the opening melee, but only insofar as scalp-prickling fear that there is a serial killer lurking in your home is technically preferable to the certainty of being stabbed to death.</p>
<p>Pardon the visceral language; Ethel are an infectiously visceral quartet. No matter the personnel (they were founded in 1998, and have swapped out some members since, as do most long-running quartets), their playing tends to be lusty, committed, charged with messy exuberance. They are heroically unafraid to make their instruments honk like geese or blat like car horns when the music calls for it. <i>Heavy</i> is their third solo album and first since 2006, when they released an album called, significantly, <i>Light</i>. The music on <i>Light</i> played on both meanings of its title: illumination and ease. By contrast, <i>Heavy</i> is a collection of dark thoughts and relentless pressures. Ethel-- which currently consists of Cornelius Dufallo and Jennifer Choi on first and second violin; Dorothy Lawson on cello, and Ralph Farris on viola--  function as a living affront to the misconception that chamber music is polite, white-napkin stuff, best deployed at corporate functions and rehearsal dinners as civilizing perfume. <i>Heavy</i> is one of their most persuasive cases yet.</p>
<p>The tensile, discordant ""Four Thoughts"", both a workout and a minefield, is one hell of an introduction. It's a morbidly mesmerizing work, Byron opening hatches into into furtive pockets of wistful, jazz-inflected harmony and slamming them abruptly shut for more surgical-saw dissonances. If this is Marvin Gaye, it is the Gaye of ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"", driven up and through the ceiling of derangement.</p>
<p>The following work, ""Spheres"", by composer John Halle, starts off by conjuring a train. Innocent enough. But this is not a happy, Aaron Copland-esque choo-choo. First we hear the clear rendering of a whistle from afar, Doppler-ing its way into earshot. But as rendered by the violins, it's a sour, whining noise, unclean or impure somehow. Then, the cello and viola, bolstered with a slightly cruel hint of amplification, begin bouncing their bows aggressively against the strings, evoking locomotion's forward-thrust monotony with none of its smoothness. If we're riding this train, we're hanging by our fingers to its outside. The piece seethes in place with magnetic conviction for exactly nine minutes and 11 seconds before burning off, disappearing back into the distance.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">For about three-quarters of its length, <i>Heavy</i> bears down on you like this. ""Early That Summer"", by <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Bang+on+a+Can"" target=""_blank"">Bang on a Can</a> co-founder Julia Wolfe, consists of nothing more than a series of dark tremolos. If the piece could be a gesture, it would be of someone jabbing a thumb into your sternum repeatedly. The players dig into the strings with the weight and determination of a small child fist-gripping a pencil and inscribing with all his might. When the pressure finally eases, in the album's back half, it's into a jumpy, uncertain sort of ease. ""No Nickel Blues"", by John King, takes the skeleton of a blues vamp for its backbone, whispering the rhythm over and over in hushed plucks. Above it, violins play wispy, ether-trailing arpeggios. The landscape evoked is of a fairly ominous stretch of back-country, one in which you feel acutely ill-equipped to survive, if it somehow came to that.</p>
<p><i>Heavy</i> is vital, haunting listening. It can also be enervating. ""La Citadelle"", by the N.Y.-based composer Raz Mesinai, erupts into a horror-show scream repeatedly. Mesinai claims influence from inflamed futurists like Edgard Varèse and Stockhausen, and you can hear their teeth-grinding insistence, their obsession with mechanization, reflected in his music. Ethel play the work like a series of sputtering wires.</p>
<p>There are two calming, restorative breaths to be had: One is David Lang's reflection-pool of harmonies ""Wed"". As always with Lang, there are hints of emotional disturbance pulling in the harmonies, lingering doubts that never dissipate, but in the context of <i>Heavy</i>, it's a spa visit. The other is Kenji Bunch's ""String Cycle No. 1"", a cool, inscrutable <i>tabula rasa </i>of open-string drones and vaguely Native-American melodies. The final piece, a gracefully antic, hip-shifting work by the Marcelos Zarvos, is almost impishly light after what preceded it: following an hour-long headlock, a breezy peck on the cheek. It reaffirms Ethel's status as a necessary jet of cold water in the contemporary classical scene. </p></div>"|16611.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16611-ethel-heavy/|7.8|Jayson Greene

Central to the plot of the episode is a battle of the bands, where the punks played a song, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3y4PFCpoOw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">also called ""Pain""</a>, that's supposed to prove how tough they were. The result is a ridiculous caricature of punk stereotypes: ""I take a hunk of concrete/ I stick it in my face/ I like to play with razor blades/ I hate the human race!"" And while New York sludge punks <a href=""http://thek-holes.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">K-Holes</a> probably don't steal stuff, slash tires, or terrorize Erik Estrada, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13134-rats/"" target=""_blank"">""Rats""</a> is <i>Dismania</i>'s straight-faced equivalent of ""Pain"". It's self-definition by way of intimidation, and it's backed by no-wave fuzz guitars and growling, vicious vocals. ""We're the rats,"" they scream, repeatedly, without a hint of irony.</p>
<p>Jack Hines (formerly of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27257-the-black-lips/"" target=""_blank"">Black Lips</a>) and Vashti Windish (also of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28507-golden-triangle/"" target=""_blank"">Golden Triangle</a>) are almost definitely delivering an affectation-- they probably aren't the characters they portray throughout <i>Dismania</i>-- but regardless, their lyrics revel in the gruesome: ""She found her home in a bucket of blood,"" for example. And when they're not comparing mosquitos to vampires or sleeping among cockroaches, they revile corporate fat cats for oppressing the working poor (""Dirty Hax""). There's so much bite and bile to <i>Dismania</i>, which strays from the more lighthearted material from their self-titled Hozac album. (The first album's ""Werewolf With a Tan"" is similarly driven by heavy fuzz-addled guitars, but lyrically, it's a novelty song.)</p>
<p>Sara Villard's saxophone is a noteworthy addition to their sound; it actually amplifies the menace by serving as an urgent, atmospheric supplement. And while their previous album featured plenty of monolithic drone, this one features several assertive, stomping riffs, like the blues-rock snarl of ""Child"" or the battering-ram thrash of ""Rats"". They also change it up with some moody warble in ""Window in the Wall"", which brings to mind Neil Young's <i>Dead Man</i> score. Their occasional shift in tone is definitely welcome, because after a while, the themes and sound of <i>Dismania</i> become aggressively humorless. It may not seem like much, but 32 straight minutes of lyrics about rodents, dead bodies, and acid rain can get exhausting.</p>
<p>But, however biting, the payoff is worth it with each individual song. ""Nightshifter"" features a rapid fire vocal delivery from Hines, which makes taking out the trash during the night shift sound like the world's most soul-suckingly miserable experience. Album closer ""Nothing New"" is the jammiest song at over five minutes, and it's satisfying to hear the band take their time on semi-psychedelic material. That's also why it's satisfying when they take a break from the album's belligerent thrash, but maintain the ominous tone. ""Frozen Stiff"" is a quietly bitter song, with all the instruments slightly more muted and the vocals toning down the vitriol. (The lyrics are vague, but the song's combination of shame, sex, cages, and ""hands tied behind my back"" suggest BDSM.)</p>
<p>If <i>Dismania</i> has a setting, it's the gutter-- every image conjured in the album involves something grim, grimy, or generally unpleasant. And their delivery perfectly suits the subject matter-- we get aggressive power chords, dour sax solos, Windish's howl, and Hines' strained screams. That overall mood never really lets up: K-Holes force you to wallow in the slime along with them, and they do it with a punk rock bark.</p></div>"|16619.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16619-dismania/|7.1|Evan Minsker

Pop music articulates desire, and you don't think about how much you want something unless you can see it dangling in front of you, just out of reach. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14472-crazy-for-you/"" target=""_blank""><i>Crazy for You</i></a>, the first full-length by Bethany Cosentino and her <a href=""http://www.bestcoast.us/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Best Coast</a> collaborator Bobb Bruno, got a lot of mileage out of yearning. Her songs structures were basic; her production consisted of the reverb-heavy, fuzzed-out nods to 1960s pop; and her lyrics found her pining for boys and feeling sad about being alone. There was nothing profound about <i>Crazy for You</i>, but there was something affecting; Cosentino was able to tap into a very specific kind of angst and articulate it in the simplest possible terms. Sometimes you want a song to untangle complex feelings and help you figure out how to get through what ails you. And sometimes you're lonely and bored and sitting there thinking about how you wish your cat could talk. For those moments, Best Coast was there.</p>
<p>It helped that <i>Crazy for You</i> was a little sloppy. Some music hides behind reverb and fuzz, but for Best Coast, the relaxed imprecision of the sound kept the music grounded. The rote chord changes and melodies and predictable lyrics (you've never heard ""crazy"" rhyme with ""lazy"" until you've heard <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCqjFxUMU6Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cosentino do it</a>) were bumped around just enough by the messy production to keep things interesting. Best Coast's new album, <i>The Only Place</i>, is another story. Produced by Jon Brion, the sound is dry and comparatively spare; the guitars jangle and twang rather than fuzz; and Cosentino's voice, still strong and clear, is front and center. After their garage-rock beginnings, Best Coast are making a bid for alt-country singer-songwriter territory à la Neko Case, a musical sphere where the nuts and bolts of songwriting and storytelling are paramount. But it proves to be a poor fit. While shifts away from atmosphere and in the direction of personality and songwriting are often a sign of growth, here the clarity and sonic directness accentuate Best Coast's weakest quality: lyrics.</p>
<p>In every instance where there's an obvious choice to be made, one clearly dictated by the formula of a song structure or rhyme scheme, that's the one Cosentino makes. This lack of care makes the record hard to identify with. It feels robotic instead of relatable, and when your medium is straightforward singer-songwriter pop, that's a serious issue. The problems were apparent out of the gate with the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13349-the-only-place/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a>, a love letter to California: It has no specificity and comes off like a tourism jingle. ""We got the ocean/ Got the babes/ Got the sun/ We got the waves"" is a couplet Mike Love would dismiss as shallow. It doesn't help that Cosentino has a strange aversion to bridges; it's hard to channel the classic songwriting forms of the 50s and 60s if you never write a middle eight. Virtually every song is verse/verse/chorus/verse/chorus/verse/chorus, and the resulting album feels longer than its 34 minutes.</p>
<p>You might be thinking, ""Hey, you could say the same thing about the Ramones,"" and there's something to that. ""Complicated"" does not equal ""better."" But as a whole, <i>The Only Place</i> strains for maturity and sophistication. There are songs about feeling alienated (""I don't want to be how they want me to be"" is a nice line) and overwhelmed (""Last Year"") but there's no spirit to match the ambition. What's odd about all this is the presence of Brion; in interviews, Cosentino has indicated that he pushed her to work, to move from writing instinctually and try and create something outside of her comfort zone. But there's little evidence of stretching here. And with its slow and mid-tempos and generally plodding delivery, there's no energy to balance out the blandness.</p>
<p>The album does have its charms. Cosentino is still in fine voice, and she continues to have a warm and agreeable persona. The songs here are reasonably catchy and tend to stick with you with repeated plays. Cosentino also has a decent ear for pastiche. She channels 1970s AM gold on ""Dreaming My Life Away"" and adds some nice backing vocals to the ""Stand by Me"" chords on ""How They Want Me to Be"".

<p>So cards on the table in my case: For the longest time, I've been a fan of Medicine's main guitarist, sometime vocalist, and general lead figure Brad Laner for everything else he's done (and he's done a lot over three decades, solo and with others, from genteel home recordings to extreme dark feedback ambience and back again). But as a young L.A.-based shoegaze freak when it all first hit two decades back, part of an ill-defined community thriving on varying mixes of Anglophilia, raves, and psych revivalism, Medicine itself was a band I detested-- one of several, granted, but because of my passion for anything even remotely shoegaze, my main one. I saw one of their first shows opening for Chapterhouse, and they bored me senseless. They opened for the Rollercoaster U.S. touring bill with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2186-the-jesus-and-mary-chain/"" target=""_blank"">the Jesus and Mary Chain</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/875-curve/"" target=""_blank"">Curve</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3914-spiritualized/"" target=""_blank"">Spiritualized</a>, and I was in agonies. A couple of years later, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4017-swervedriver/"" target=""_blank"">Swervedriver</a> made one of many great L.A. appearances and... yep, them again. What I heard of their studio work irritated me at best; any claims made for their being as good as the UK types made me bang my head against a wall. </p>
<p>Listening to all this again with distance and time under my belt is the kind of healthy exercise I should have done some time ago, something all listeners probably should do with their own comparative examples, a necessary reexamination of prejudices as much as it never hurts to reconsider fandoms. The end result's one of the more enjoyably frustrating experiences I've had in a while, in that on the one hand I can pretty readily tell you exactly why the work of Laner, singer Beth Thompson, and percussionist Jim Goodall, plus various associates and earlier bandmates, is worth investigating. Yet at the same time it often still seems somehow to not quite work, an assemblage of often-excellent parts that never gels into a whole but gets close.</p>
<p>For instance,<i> Shot Forth Self Living</i>, the band's 1992 debut, feels more like a collection of experiments than a fully cohesive release. Laner takes the initial lead vocal on ""One More"" and crops up here and there throughout, but it's mostly Thompson being the main voice, sweetly caught between lyrical directness and being lost in the mix over performances that set a woozy but steady pace. Occasionally things get stripped down a little, but usually to showcase the core combination of Laner's central riffs, twisted patterns that sound like they're cutting through honey-- ""Christmas Song"", which concluded the original album, shows this to a T-- and through Thompson's contemplations. Songs like ""Sweet Explosion"" and ""Aruca"", especially thanks to the rhythms, sound like they're rubbing shoulders as much with Madchester hangovers-- think very, very early <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/409-blur/"" target=""_blank"">Blur</a>-- as much as, say, ""Soon"", and not exactly successfully. But things can still connect just fine when Laner and crew completely go nuts: The appropriately titled ""Queen of Tension"", which seems to breeze along calmly until a dropped burst of drumming, insect sounds, and at least two freakish guitar solos on top of each other, stands out here.</p>
<p>With <i>The Buried Life</i>, Medicine's path ended up matching contemporaries Curve's to a striking degree; like the UK band, Medicine followed up their debut with a stronger second album in 1993 with greater overall variety leading the way. ""Slut"" might as well be a Curve homage in itself, with the band finding a perfect mix of Goodall's dance-nodding percussion, Thompson's coolly dismissive singing, and Laner's guitar sounding like a circular saw looping through sheet metal. But the frazzled edges, nagging-in-the-ear guitar tones, found-sound samples, and sense of rough mantras as opposed to hyper-precision marks Medicine's work as more of its own beast, as much as even more direct accessability elsewhere. Vocal pop hooks on songs like ""Babydoll"" and the joyful-sounding clatter of ""Never Click"" are livelier, while ""Something Goes Wrong"" actually sounds a bit like <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9e157Ner90"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Waite's ""Missing You""</a> with a lot more feedback. And none other than art-pop lodestone Van Dyke Parks turns up with piano and orchestrations on ""Live It Down"" (as well as a bonus-track version of their almost-hit ""Time Baby"").</p>
<p>Regardless, the personal itches that Medicine seemed designed from the start to scratch ended up much more strongly satisfied elsewhere, from the pretty guitar violence of the still underrated Lovesliescrushing back then to the commanding charisma of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7374-school-of-seven-bells/"" target=""_blank"">School of Seven Bells</a> now.

The NYC band's lead singer, Jorge Elbrecht, was a founding member of the now-dormant ""art collective"" <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2588-lansing-dreiden/"" target=""_blank"">Lansing-Dreiden</a>, who last signed off full-length-wise with 2006's murky, equally new wave and OMD-worshipping <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9024-the-dividing-island/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Dividing Island</i></a>. Violens' 2010 debut, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14813-amoral/"" target=""_blank""><i>Amoral</i></a>, ditched the shadows and fog for pop-rock bounce and Boo Radleys impressions that were impressively faithful, if not totally memorable. For the band's follow-up, <i>True</i>, they've moved to perpetually in-vogue indie pop revivalist mecca Slumberland. In general, Elbrecht and his latest project haven't strayed too far from the same sonic mission announced circa L-D's excellent <i>The Dividing Island</i> cut ""Two Extremes"": All sonic roads still end shortly before Bill Clinton first took residence in the White House, the previous Echo and the Bunnymen comparisons joined here by takes on the jangly roar of first-wave shoegazers like Pale Saints, Slowdive, and Ride.</p>
<p>Those slight changes in genre-based sound are the results of <i>True</i> being Violens' first true full-band effort, as the record's writing sessions began while the band's current lineup was touring behind <i>Amoral</i>. This turns out to be a boon, since <i>True</i> sounds more melodically pretty and dewy-eyed than its predecessor. If you're the ceiling-staring type that gets chills from just a few seconds of chiming guitar, or maybe a snatch of achingly sung vocals, this record might be just your thing. Undoubtedly, these simple pleasures seem all the more pleasurable because the bar's been lowered over the past few years when it comes to ""this kind of stuff,"" which gives <i>True</i> a whiff of ephemerality; on the other hand, ""enjoy it while you can"" doesn't seem like particularly terrible advice as long as you can, well, enjoy it.</p>
<p>When I say ""this kind of stuff,"" I'm referring to the current and ongoing guitar-indie embrace of shoegaze-derived texture and feel, which wasn't very present in the sparkling clarity that <i>Amoral</i> wore like the prettiest nail polish. On <i>True</i>, that's been replaced by the kind of production touches you'd expect from a Slumberland release-- reverb, distanced vocals, guitars coated in a warm glow. Over the past few years, those things have become synonymous with representing guitar-focused indie music that's tagged as ""lo-fi,"" but there's not much about <i>True</i> that sounds home-recorded or shabby. As he did on <i>Amoral</i>, Elbrecht handled the production duties on <i>True</i>, and his able ear makes <i>True</i> less a lo-fi shoegaze-revivalist LP and more of a studio professional's idea of what a lo-fi shoegaze-revivalist LP would sound like. It's the small details, like the howling wind and bird cries that open ""Sariza Spring"" or the exquisitely applied layers of echo on closer ""So Hard to See"", that mark this album as a headphones listen.</p>
<p>Here's why I hold some reservation against Violens: <i>True</i> shows that Elbrecht and his band are more than capable of recreating moments from the past in a way that is reverent and still provides pleasure to those who grew up listening to those past sounds and relative newbies alike. But I'm not so sure that they're good at doing much more than that. Violens seem to have hit their sweet spot here, though, so hopefully they'll continue drilling in the same place instead of looking for more history that's ripe for plundering.</p></div>"|16617.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16617-true/|6.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

Leaping from one hot sound to the next hotter sound seems to be the M.O. for a number of today's musicians. On the other side of that spectrum sits <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/onelittleplane"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">One Little Plane</a> aka Kathryn Bint, a songwriter content to leave a four-year gap between her debut LP, <i>Until</i>, and this new one, <i>Into the Trees</i>. There are no tricks or gimmicks to her music either; instead Bint crafts a world of gentle, meditative motion out of simple melodies.</p>
<p>This record, like her first, comes with a production job from <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tpe4id7cLnU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kieran Hebden</a>. While sonically his influence is understated, it's still worth thinking about Hebden as a finger-pointer. Songs like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13305-she-was-out-in-the-water/"" target=""_blank"">""She Was Out in the Water""</a>, featuring Radiohead's Colin Greenwood on bass, are built brick-by-brick in a similarly circular way to Four Tet's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBRK2ud43sI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">earliest work</a>. Around the time of <i>Pause </i>in 2001, Hebden was more likely to sample wind chimes than drop a sub-bass; his music felt pretty folky and zen-like. One Little Plane shares that ethos, and it helps make this record a more curious and psychedelic affair than it easily might have been.</p>
<p><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13533-hold-you-down/"" target=""_blank"">""Hold You Down""</a>, the other track with Greenwood on bass, is the highlight, a song that builds from a rudimentary start into something more humid and pretty. There's even a bit of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD4N0749e2w"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Martina Topley-Bird</a>'s husky drawl lurking at the fringes of Bint's vocal as gentle percussion and harmonies give the song a lush swirl. Despite a couple of sticky lyrics, ""Bloom"" stands out too: a soft synth making for intriguingly minimal company to Bint's vocal as she sings, ""We will stay here, until we bloom."" It's pretty, visual-sounding music.</p>
<p>Most of the time <i>Into the Trees</i> holds a soft, pretty orbit, so when Bint flays that vibe on ""I Know"", it comes across as striking and intense. Beneath a droning backdrop she sings a warning of, ""There is a road that I will not go down/ If you want me then stand your ground,"" before later exploding the song with fuzzy guitars. It's a moment of teeth-baring on a record that otherwise feels content to keep you at arm's length.</p>
<p>Bint's mostly relaxed and easy approach teases out enough pleasant moments on <i>Into the Trees</i> but rarely offers a resolution. The weakest moments feel embryonic and too well-worn: Songs like ""It's Alright"" and ""Simmer Down Simmer"" mine overly familiar chord progressions and emotions that manipulate rather than coax. For the most part, though, <i>Into the Trees</i> is a curious and enjoyable listen. It also feels like a record happy to exist outside of anything else, and if nothing else that resolve makes One Little Plane an intriguing prospect.</p></div>"|16613.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16613-one-little-plane/|6.8|Hari Ashurst

The German duo's past decade of releases have tracked those of the legendary Detroit techno producer in vibe as well as strict sonic detail, sharing a largeness of vision and penchant for tidal surges of overwhelming intensity, sweeping away the dancefloor like a glacier descending on a small town. Kristian Beyer and Frank Wiedemann are never framed this way-- they're too housey, too popular, too <i>European--</i> but they're also second only to Craig as the pre-eminent contemporary popularizers of the Detroit techno aesthetic. Both sound fascinated with a certain kind of fluid roboticism and syncopated propulsion that immediately evokes the motor city: You can hear it in Âme tracks like their <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKNFsK7eUew"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">remix of Rodamaal's ""Insomnia""</a>, which simultaneously evokes a nuclear power station charging up and some kind of alien samba. </p>
<p>Craig's unparalleled back-catalog has allowed his more recent output a certain clarity and focus, a sense of hitting targets with practiced precision. Âme have tried to fit both Craig's earlier and more recent approaches into their spartan release schedule, and seem to try to find their footing on uncertain terrain even as they stretch out into a sprint. This yields its own benefits, with Âme tunes reliably offering the biggest <i>and </i>most startling moments in any DJ sets they grace. That sense of startlement is undercut somewhat by the conservative DJ set format of <i>Live</i>, which presents a potted history of the duo's past eight years. Pristine and devoid of audience noise, <i>Live </i>is neither a genuine live document, nor does it offer much of the self-manipulation that characterizes many of dance music's greatest ""live"" albums. The set's modest ambitions seem born of pragmatism: The duo's last full-length release was their 2004 eponymous debut, and <i>Live </i>offers an unofficial ""greatest hits"" that can appeal both to the newcomer and the established fan.</p>
<p><i>Live</i>'s pedantic interspersing of vocal and instrumental tunes suggests a kind of contest, which the instrumental tunes decisively win. Âme's remixes and vocal tracks are never less than fine, but here the consistently flowery vocals-- from Amampondo's keening to UNKLE's awful 90s rave poetry-- can feel intrusive, distracting from the mechanized rigor of the grooves with their insistent personality. Âme's frequent collaborator Henrik Schwarz does well with vocal-based remixes perhaps because his own sound is so artfully naturalistic; Âme's sound is not, instead peaking when it feels <i>least </i>human and evacuated of recognizable emotion. Which is not to say that this music is purely functional or anti-narrativist; rather, its most vivid stories are those that machines tell themselves in the hushed isolation of the night. ""Enoi"", with its blaring foghorns and creeping, abstracted menace, imagines countless unmanned submarines positioning to commence World War III amongst themselves. ""Setsa"", all clattering percussion and shivering organ, could be a funeral march for a dead factory. Most commandingly, the inimitable ""Rej"" could be taken from a modern remake of <i>Fantasia</i>, its shimmering and deliquescing keyboard runs offering the perfect soundtrack to a glowing underwater ballet dance performed by electric eels. These sounds have enough character to render vocals redundant: Âme's remix of Underworld's ""Crocodile"" is astonishing less for how the duo frames Karl Hyde's vocal than for what happens when they nearly leave him behind, unleashing a remarkable duet between a prowling bassline and involutedly syncopated synth arpeggio, in perhaps this set's most unabashedly triumphant victory lap.</p>
<p><i>Live </i>can feel a bit like a missed opportunity: Âme's arrangements are deep enough to merit more meditative stretches, and anthemic enough to demand longer pinnacles than the duo allows itself here: 14 tracks over nearly 80 minutes hardly seems excessive until one remembers that in their original form these tracks usually average about nine minutes, and they're meant to be played as close to completely as the DJ can manage, their endlessly, inexorably rising sense of excitement rippling like a shiver running across your skin with agonizing slowness. By contrast, <i>Live </i>can seem <i>too </i>efficient, each track put through its paces and returned to the stalls to make way for the next tune's climax, the effect resembling the rolling-hills setting on a treadmill. But this is the griping of the listener who already knows and loves these tunes, and lovable they are; to the uninitiated, <i>Live </i>will be revelatory simply by virtue of its tracklist.</p></div>"|16618.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16618-live/|7.3|Tim Finney

It's the 2012 equivalent to Ice Cube and the Bomb Squad's similarly inspired bicoastal union on <i>AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted.</i> Limiting himself to one producer, legends-only guest spots, and a real sense that he'd better make this one count, Killer Mike rises to the occasion.</p>
<p>But while this record is sure to please longtime fans, it also works as a compelling introduction. As in the past, <i>R.A.P. Music </i>takes a stand politically without going off the grid into conspiracy theorizing or sounding so circumspect that you'd think Mike himself was running for public office. On ""Reagan"", he calls out the government for spending billions of taxpayer dollars invading foreign land as ""a hobby paid for by the oil lobby."" To him, the ""War on Drugs"" is mostly an excuse for crooked cops to illegally search and seize young black men. But if you happen to be a phony rapper that's dumb enough to spit that ""fiction sold by conglomerates"" in Mike's neighborhood, you can expect to leave without your chain and dignity. None of this is contradictory to anyone with a lick of sense, but there's a tangible thrill in hearing someone tell it like it is with such conviction.</p>
<p>There was enough spleen vented on the <i>Grind </i>mixtapes to last until the next decade; on <i>R.A.P.</i>, there's more heart and soul, both musically and spiritually. In a recent <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4666AaZCwE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview with Pitchfork.tv</a>, Mike seemed particularly fond of the scene he sets during ""Untitled"", wherein the women closest to him in life are placed within an epic historical scale: ""Will my woman be Corretta take my name and cherish it?/ Or will she Jackie O drop the Kennedy, remarry it/ My sister say it's necessary on some Cleopatra shit/ My grandmamma said 'no, never that, it's sacrilege.'"" It's part of a deep respect for family that runs throughout <i>R.A.P. Music, </i>whether it's to his cop father during the ""fuck the police"" narrative <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13384-dont-die/"" target=""_blank"">""Don't Die""</a>, or his wife amidst astonishing Southernplayalistic pimp shit on ""Southern Fried"". He dedicates the last verse to her (""I married a Trina/ Pretty as a singer/ Fine as a stripper""), informing all other girls that if you want a piece of Killer Mike, you gotta service his woman too. It's actually kinda heartwarming.</p>
<p>Let's take a moment and talk about the actual rapping on<i> R.A.P. Music</i>. <i>Dear lord, the rapping on this thing</i>. When he first started appearing on dirtier <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3199-outkast/"" target=""_blank"">OutKast</a> tracks like ""Snappin' &amp; Trappin'"", Mike might've been seen as the devil on Big Boi's shoulder opposite André. It's become clear since then he takes a backseat to no one in the Dungeon Family. Transcribing a jaw-dropping bout of dexterity like, ""And what's happenin'/ Ménage-a-nage in my garage/ With these two young ladies is the reason I A.D.I.D.A.S./ That's all day I dream about that sex scene/ You textin' hopin' that they call you/ I just barbecue and call 'em up and say, 'hey fall through,'"" feels about as effective as trying to explain <i>Led Zeppelin IV </i>with guitar tablature. Mike introduces himself on ""Untitled"", saying, ""You are witnessing elegance/ In the form of a black elephant,"" and it's a perfect summation of Mike's muscular yet impossibly nimble vocals. There's no reason for him to make a two-minute, no-hook track like ""Go!"" other than to prove he can destroy anyone in terms of pure technique ""even when I ain't sayin' <i>sheeeit</i>."" The sheer sonic effect of the volley of words on <i>R.A.P.</i> could thrill a hip-hop fan who doesn't speak a word of English.  </p>
<p>Not that you shouldn't be paying attention to what Killer Mike says throughout <i>R.A.P. Music</i><i>.</i>  ""Reagan"" is the one that names names and cites facts to denigrate the presidency as little more than ""telling lies on teleprompters"" to serve the ""country's real masters."" But on ""Anywhere But Here"", the trickle-down effect of corruption is felt on a more local scale. After solemnly acknowledging the police brutality and economic stratification of New York, Mike takes a look at his home city of Atlanta, seemingly a ""black male's heaven"" as one the most racially progressive in the nation, ""Even though it's blacktop from the mayors to the cops/ Black blood still gets spilled."" ""Don't Die"" shows a vivid example of that: Cops break into Mike's house on a hunch and things inevitably get violent. Though the concept of their being there in the first place because ""a nigga on this rap shit"" might initially sound trite, if you don't believe the suspicion of being a part of that culture is enough to get you harassed and then killed, you might need to start watching the news. That's really why ""Don't Die"" can take its place alongside anti-authoritarian classics like ""Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos"": The big picture is timeless; the news fills in the blanks to make it depressing in its timeliness.</p>
<p>There are plenty of hip-hop records with worthy causes but the good intentions don't always make your car stereo knock. That's not an issue here: I don't think we'll hear a better end-to-end production job on a rap record than we do on <i>R.A.P. Music</i>. El-P has managed to make strides in learning to give a rapper like Mike what he needs: on 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13797-atl-rmx/"" target=""_blank"">ATL RMX</a>, </i>he reconfigured Young Jeezy's ""I Got This"" with a punishing beat that somehow managed to overexert its will on the guy rapping. We get wheezing organs, incessantly ticking hi-hats, guitar skronk, and soul claps tamed to do Mike and El's evil bidding whether it's B-boy boom bap (""Jojo's Chillin'"") or chain-swang braggadocio (""Butane (Champion's Anthem)""). I'm tempted to call it ""warm,"" but so is nuclear radiation, and the bass most often sounds like a monstrous, gleefully evil sandworm that could guest star on ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force""<i>.</i></p>
<p>On the closing title track, Mike equates <i>R.A.P. Music </i>to something holy, within the lineage of the most legendary black musicians: ""That Miles Davis <i>Bitches Brew</i>, that 'beee-yatch' said by playboy Too [$hort]."" More appropriate are the multiple lyrical nods to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3411-public-enemy/"" target=""_blank"">Public Enemy</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3086-nwa/"" target=""_blank"">N.W.A.</a>, even if <i>R.A.P. Music </i>doesn't break enough rules or have enough of a platform to reach the levels of <i>Fear of a Black Planet </i>or <i>Straight Outta Compton </i>or <i>Death Certificate</i>. But it does come off as the kind of powerful mid-career album those acts <i>should've </i>been able to make as hip-hop's elder spokesmen-- artists granted an evergreen relevance similar to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4053-bruce-springsteen/"" target=""_blank"">Bruce Springsteen</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=neil+young"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young</a>-- had it not been for their irreparable personnel issues: impervious to trends, passionate about politics <i>and </i>pleasure, something that a college professor could base a lecture on even as his students blast it at house parties later that night.</p></div>"|16537.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16537-killer-mike-rap-music/|8.6|Ian Cohen

Though it lacks an actual chorus, ""Lazy Eye"" still packs a considerable emotional charge, thanks to the creeping tension between the song's cool precision and frontman Brian Aubert's efforts to destabilize it, through arrhythmic guitar scraping and an increasingly agitated vocal. Though the song's tone is subdued and serious, I always smirk during Aubert's climactic shriek of the line ""everyone's so focused clearly on... such shine,"" as if he were single-handedly trying to destroy the fun-in-the-sun spirit that defines so much Californian pop music. Which is to say: ""Lazy Eye"" remains Silversun Pickups' biggest and best song because it's their most human, imperfect, irrational one.</p>
<p>But those endearing qualities have become increasingly difficult to glean from Silversun Pickups these days. The band's third album, <i>Neck of the Woods</i>, picks up where 2009's sophomore release, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12926-swoon/"" target=""_blank""><i>Swoon</i></a>, left off, inheriting the task of blowing up Silversun Pickups' hazy-headed pop to more muscular, arena-ready proportions. Which is to be expected: This is, after all, a band whose two albums have sold over half a million copies to date combined, so there's a natural inclination to want to keep hitting the back rows even as they move ever further away. But there's an increasing disconnect between ambition and execution: While <i>Neck of the Woods</i> boasts all the hallmarks of a big-budget, radio-ready modern-rock record-- including a production credit for Jacknife Lee, a guy who knows a thing or two about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12130-intimacy/"" target=""_blank"">polishing up once-scrappy indie-rock bands</a> for KROQ contention-- Silversun Pickups have a way of making their most grandiose gestures sound passive and timid. The album's over-the-top but underwhelming nature is best summed up by a line from the aforementioned breakthrough single: ""I've been waiting for this moment all my life/ But it's not quite right.""</p>
<p>It doesn't help that Aubert's effete voice lacks the domineering, egomaniacal presence to convincingly command his band's bombast. Even those who have allergic reactions to Billy Corgan or Matt Bellamy's prog-rock histrionics would never doubt their sense of bravado, but Aubert has the tendency to pull back right when he should be going for broke. Just as the protracted intro of opener ""Skin Graph"" finally yields to a satisfyingly gnarly chorus at the three-minute mark, Aubert loses himself in a buzz-killing, ambient detour; when he returns for one final charge through the chorus, the feeling is less one of shock and surprise than ""what the fuck took you so long?""</p>
<p>This kind of structural over-tinkering is endemic on <i>Neck of the Woods</i>, an album that Silversun Pickups claim was <a href=""http://www.spin.com/gallery/woods-behind-silversun-pickups-may-lp"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">inspired by horror movies</a>; if so, they're the kind of horror movies where you wait a long time for twists you can see coming a mile away, with the visceral impact all but diluted by a glossy CGI sheen. The album places a premium on foreboding synth atmospherics, dramatic pauses, extended build-ups and breakdowns, and 1998-vintage rock-tronic beats-- and, in doing so, stretches mid-tempo song after mid-tempo song to the five-minute mark and beyond, forsaking the sort of peaks-and-valleys sequencing necessary for maintaining dramatic momentum over the course of an hour-long sprawl. And the clinical, vacuum-sealed production renders even the most <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWmlwTBdsvY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Rock Band</i>-worthy</a> moments (the machine-gunned fills on ""Out of Breath"", the Zeppelin-esque chorus riff of ""Gun-Shy Sunshine"", the robo-grunge thrust of ""Mean Spirits"") with a mechanized sterility that keeps the explosions contained.</p>
<p><i>Neck of the Woods</i> does yield at least one bona-fide direct hit to ensure future Weenie Roast bookings: ""Bloody Mary (Nerve Endings)"", a gleaming, synth-swathed power ballad that's of a piece with the maximal digi-symphonies of M83's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15881-hurry-up-were-dreaming/"" target=""_blank""><i>Hurry Up, We're Dreaming</i></a>. But even as Silversun Pickups continue to dutily follow the Smashing Pumpkins' career trajectory by trading in shoegaze haze for <i>Adore</i>-inspired electro-pop, perhaps the most 90s thing about them is that, even in the age of downloading and streaming, they still make albums as if they need to take full advantage of a CD's storage capacity and give the Sam Goody customer their $22.98's worth. Appropriately enough, many of Aubert's lyrics here bristle with restlessness, fatigue and disappointment-- ""I'm still waiting,"" ""I'm already bored,"" ""What am I aiming towards/ A fight that never ends,"" ""Nothing's coming""-- all of which serve to make <i>Neck of the Woods</i> a concept album about the feeling you get listening to <i>Neck of the Woods</i>.</p></div>"|16615.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16615-neck-of-the-woods/|4.8|Stuart Berman

Basically, not Malian folk-blues. The label came to Touré through a demo he and his manager sent in because they were fans of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3509-radian/"" target=""_blank"">Radian</a>, a semi-obscure Viennese Thrill Jockey band that hasn't put out an album since 2009. If you're looking for great little stories to encapsulate the hookups facilitated by the globalization of culture and communication, there you go.</p>
<p>Touré is from Gao, a city on the Niger River near the southern edge of the Saharan desert, which covers a massive portion of northern Mali. As of this writing, Gao is of particular international interest: At the end of March, it was seized from the Malian government by Tuareg rebels and now serves at the capital of Azawad, the Tuareg state that declared independence from Mali in early April. Touré is currently safe in Bamako, the country's capital, about 700 miles southwest of Gao.</p>
<p>None of this may mean anything to you. I convey it only out of reportorial duty and to highlight the strangeness of Touré's context: an artist who broke from his purebred bloodline to pursue guitar, later winning a string of prizes from the Malian government, and even later having his hometown be a focal point of political upheaval that has pushed his country toward serious instability just as he starts to get press and attention from far, far away.</p>
<p>If you've never heard Malian blues before, well, there's nothing to compare it to other than Malian blues. Suffice it to say that the harmonic character of the music-- the ""chords""-- will probably sound familiar, but the rhythms and structures won't. Malian blues is typified by lead vocals and melodies that play over rhythmically interwoven lines of guitar with the lilt of a boat rocking on a river. The spacious, heavy quality of American blues is replaced with something more Eastern, a constancy of sound closer to, say, Indian music, and it also makes a lot of use of 6/8 time, which is sort of like a jig or a gallop-- a contrast to the square 4/4 of its American analog.</p>
<p>Touré's last Thrill Jockey album, 2011's <i>Sahel Folk</i>, was recorded in his sister's house in Gao with a string of collaborators. Press holds that he would meet with people, make a pot of tea, decide on a song, chitchat, then break for the afternoon, only to come back the next day and lay it down in a take or two. <i>Koïma</i>, by comparison, is a more structured album, and what it lacks in that illusory spontaneity of the front porch, it makes up for in intensity and focus. <i>Sahel Folk</i> was primarily guitar; <i>Koïma</i>, in contrast, has prominent electric bass, and the scratchy, hypnotic sound of the sokou, a folk violin. It also features vocals by Leïla Ahimidi Gobbi, a woman with a high, squealing voice that cuts through the mix like citrus through fat-- a perfect contrast to Touré's own tenor, which fits the character of the instruments so snugly it sometimes blends into the background. The arrangements are as subtle as they are detailed, and the result is a little like one of those optical illusions where, in what seems like a static image, the eye perceives weird, fluttering movements.</p>
<p><i>Koïma</i> is a beautiful album, and at times beautiful to the exclusion of anything else. Hearing this music-- which I'm told is classified as traditional-style Songhai folk-- has to be different for me than for the Malian who might've been raised around stuff like it. Context in this case is a little damning: Is what I'm hearing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5231-bill-callahan/"" target=""_blank"">Bill Callahan</a> or is it Mumford and Sons? No idea, but it's certainly being packaged as authentic. In either case, I doubt it matters: As a Western listener, there's always some enlightening novelty in hearing the blues-- especially the blues coming from a place currently as fouled-up as Mali-- recast as something so bright, so unapologetically hopeful.</p></div>"|16616.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16616-koima/|7.0|Mike Powell

On the covers of the first several releases by the international drone-doom duo of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3984-sunn-o/"" target=""_blank"">Sunn O)))</a>'s Stephen O'Malley and Peter ""Pita"" Rehberg, that insignia forced some shade of dark against another. On 2006's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9666-ktl/"" target=""_blank""><i>KTL</i></a>, for instance, it was big and black, centered and dominant against a faded gray-to-grayer gradient. Two years later, for <i>2</i>, it had been bronzed and almost swallowed by a sea of blacks and browns, suggesting a steady wash of inescapable darkness. O'Malley and Rehberg began KTL, after all, in order to score <i>Kindertotenlieder</i> (which shares a name with a Mahler piece and translates as ""songs on the death of children""), a sort of hyper-reality play in which <a href=""http://contemporaryperformance.com/2011/05/12/in-performance-gisele-viennes-kindertotenlieder-france/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""a group of teenagers get together for a death ritual in the form of a black metal concert.""</a> Darkness doesn't only become KTL; it actually begat them. </p>
<p>The cover of <i>V</i>, then, looks a little bit like a mission statement: Against a white background, the excellent digital musician and artist Mark Fell adds fluorescence to the X, the arrow, and the cross, turning them green, pink, electric blue, and yellow. He then thickens the lines, so that, when they intersect, the thicket of color bleeds again toward black, light and relief escaping back toward KTL's typically despondent aesthetic. </p>
<p>The five tracks on the pair's first record in three years fit that multivalent image perfectly: With what's best described as a heavy glow, the first four pieces of <i>V</i> strip away most of the metal discord of those previous albums without turning the volume down or slimming the sound's saturation. The album's suffocating stunner, ""Tony"", wobbles in before a complex, textural hum-- a high, thin murmur countered by a low, slowly oscillating tone beneath-- floods the speakers. Across its 14 minutes, clipped sheets of noise occasionally mount the massive drone, pocking the veneer with tiny teeth of abrasion. Never quite still, ""Tony"" is a study in subtle motion above and beneath the surface, with shifts in the hum up top countered by sonar-like events and echoes bouncing throughout the bottom. The less stable ""Study A"" shares the same liminal qualities, constantly working to exist across boundaries-- motion feels like stasis, harsh feedback blurs into harmonious resonance, luminosity eclipses itself.</p>
<p>Stylistically transgressive, these tracks offer a surprising junction of various musical outfields: Those interested in the warped radiance of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1917-tim-hecker/"" target=""_blank"">Tim Hecker</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"" target=""_blank"">Christian Fennesz</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4714-yellow-swans/"" target=""_blank"">Yellow Swans</a> should find entry points here, while the more minimal maneuvers of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/25144-thomas-koner/"" target=""_blank"">Thomas Köner</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4591-keith-fullerton-whitman/"" target=""_blank"">Keith Fullerton Whitman</a> seem but a few slow steps away. And if it's the gravity of Sunn O))) that pulls you toward KTL (O'Malley is a co-founder, of course, while Rehberg has frequently collaborated with the band), these pieces are actually more monolithic than some of KTL's previously fragmented recordings. Impressively, <i>V</i> is expansive and sprawling, somehow lighter without being at all slighter.</p>
<p>All of these strains converge most clearly and contrastingly for the last two pieces, both collaborations with very different performers. On ""Phill 2"", Icelandic composer <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2199-johann-johannsson/"" target=""_blank"">Jóhann Jóhannsson</a> lends his steady grace to KTL's stately brood, resulting in a quarter-hour span that hovers between spaces both empyrean and abysmal. Strings grind downward while horns lift skyward, girded together by an inescapable but sometimes barely perceptible web of electronics. It's like watching two equal forces attempt to move in opposite directions, unaware that they are intrinsically and immortally linked-- a tragicomedy of divested best intentions. During the final piece here, ""Last Spring: A Prequel"", O'Malley and Rehberg finally give into that darkness at the center of <i>V</i>'s cover. The piece takes the name of the latest collaboration between American author Dennis Cooper and French puppeteer and playwright, Gisèle Vienne, the pair responsible for <i>Kindertotenlieder</i>-- and so, KTL. ""Last Spring"" slices and scrambles the prurient voice of Jonathan Capdevielle as he reads a bit of Cooper text from the show in French. Beyond eerie, it's the sound of all the light being squeezed from the previous hour, a 21-minute arrow back into KTL's customary core of blacks. </p></div>"|16622.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16622-v/|8.1|Grayson Currin

Tucker was the Thing of the Velvets' Fantastic Four, the B.A. Baracus of their A-Team, a hedgehog in a band of foxes: They were avant-gardists and songcrafters and texturalists, but she was an unstoppable brute-force musician who grounded and drove their first three albums and their live shows.</p>
<p>Her singular gift (and game-amateur singing voice) also made her the least likely member of the Velvet Underground to have a solo career, and after briefly rejoining the Doug Yule-led lineup, she drifted away from music for nearly a decade. Aside from a remake of the Velvets' then-unreleased ""I'm Sticking With You"" recorded in 1974 with the band's disciples Jonathan Richman and Willie Alexander, <i>I Feel So Far Away</i> picks up the story in 1980, picking over the four studio albums and other material she recorded over the next two decades.</p>
<p>For the most part, she stuck to comfortable territory: low-polish, uncomplicated rock'n'roll, with the occasional heart-on-sleeve slow one. Six of the songs on these two discs are Velvets remakes; two more are by Bo Diddley, and a third is named after him. There are covers of ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow?"", ""To Know Him Is to Love Him"", ""Then He Kissed Me"", and ""Danny Boy"". Lou Reed, John Cale, and Sterling Morrison all turn up in Tucker's groups here-- all three of them on ""I'm Not"". (Other guest stars include Daniel Johnston, Half Japanese, two Violent Femmes, and three Sonic Youth.)</p>
<p>Two discs of solo Moe is probably a surplus for anyone but Velvet Underground aficionados, although there are a lot of those. The only original song that really stands up alongside their canon is ""Hey Mersh!"", from Tucker's headlong 1989 album <i>Life in Exile After Abdication</i>, with Reed's lead guitar carving his initials all over it. There's also something to be said for 1982's <i>Playin' Possum</i>, a bunch of home-recorded oldies (plus ""Heroin"") on which Tucker played everything herself: It's loose, out of tune, and clearly done purely for the fun of flexing the old muscles. And if anybody's got the right to write a ripoff of the Velvets' ""I Can't Stand It"" (1991's ""Too Shy""), it's the inventor of that cavewoman beat.</p>
<p>Tucker apparently quit making music about 10 years ago; she was most recently in the public eye about a year and a half ago, when she appeared on TV news as a <a href=""http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/rftmusic/2010/10/moe_tucker_interview_2010_politics_tea_party_velvet_underground_video.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tea Party supporter</a>. Her strongest political statements, though, appear here: ""That's B.A.D."" and ""Spam Again"", both of which concern the economic trap Tucker found herself in as one of the working poor. That a member of one of America's most important rock bands could have to struggle to support her kids with a low-wage job at Wal-Mart is an embarrassment for both the country and the music business.</p></div>"|16612.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16612-moe-tucker-i-feel-so-far-away-anthology-1974-1998/|6.6|Douglas Wolk

Over the course of four albums that's exactly what this band has done. Two people from Baltimore started by making incense-smelling, curtains-drawn bedroom pop. Now, eight years later, they make luminous, sky-sized songs that conjure some alternate universe where <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/785-cocteau-twins/"" target=""_blank"">Cocteau Twins</a> have headlined every stadium on Atlantis. ""Bloom"" is also what these 10 songs do, each one starting with the sizzle of a lit fuse and at some fine moment exploding like a firework in slow motion. The word captures the music's slow sonority: the round, gleaming edges of Alex Scally's arpeggios and how, in Victoria Legrand's unhurried mouth, all words seem to have a few extra vowels.</p>
<p>And here we thought they'd already bloomed. Two years ago, Beach House signed to big-time indie Sub Pop, started selling out larger rooms, and put out their first great record, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13872-teen-dream/"" target=""_blank""><i>Teen Dream</i></a>. Brimming with lush sadness and lyrics that painstakingly documented the evaporation of a love (""It can't be gone,"" Legrand gasped on ""10 Mile Stereo"", ""We're still right here""). <i>Teen Dream</i> was a break-up album, a clearer and more assured exploration of the exquisite, minor-key feelings the band had been mining since their <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9502-beach-house/"" target=""_blank"">self-titled debut</a>. It felt like such a complete realization of the band's potential that it had to make you wonder-- a little worried, even-- where could they possibly go from here?</p>
<p><i>Bloom</i> suggests that this is the wrong question. ""I hate it when bands change between records,"" Scally <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/8831-beach-house/"" target=""_blank"">admitted recently</a>. ""[T]hat's not the way we work."" And he's right: Beach House haven't changed, or at least not much. <i>Bloom</i> doesn't stray far from the structure or the emotional tenor of its predecessor. It finds the band making small, sharp adjustments to its craft, but these shifts are so subtle it takes a few listens for them to sink in. The songwriting is tighter, yet the atmosphere feels more diffuse; the lyrics are more straightforward, yet they're somehow suggestive of larger things. By just about every measure, <i>Bloom</i>'s wingspan is fuller than anything Beach House have done before.</p>
<p>Much of the power of Beach House's music lies in the way it forgoes simple, this-means-this storytelling in favor of communicating indescribable emotions. Still, <i>Bloom</i> has a definite thematic fascination with idle youth and the bittersweet residue that remains once it's gone. ""Troublemaker"" looms with the threat of bad romance, and the brazen, epic ""Wild""-- one of their best songs yet-- conjures teenage feelings of boredom, broken homes (""Our father won't come home, 'cause he is seeing double""), and the inordinate amounts of faith placed in the things that take someone out of those particular hells (""That's when your car pulls up, its hood is black and gleaming""). Legrand's ethereal contralto huffs so much life into her lines that even lyrics that look plain on the page take flight. Throughout, Legrand and Scally sound in perfect sync: his nimble riffs punctuate her long, drawn-out notes to add depth and layered rhythm to the tracks.</p>
<p>Toward the end comes a mid-tempo, quietly spectacular song called ""Wishes"", on which Legrand sings about ""the moment when a memory aches."" It might be tempting to call that feeling nostalgia. But the sort of nostalgia <i>Bloom</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> employs feels so distant from the definition that word has taken on lately when we talk about music. What they do feels not just wonderfully self-contained but improbably intimate: It's a huge testament to Legrand and Scally that, although they're one of the most popular bands in the indiesphere at the moment, their music still has the hushed air of an overheard secret.</span></p>
<p>Filmmakers call the part of the day right before the sun goes down ""the magic hour."" It's that brief moment when the waning daylight causes everything to take on a holy, hazy glow. It took Terrence Malick about a year to shoot his 1978 movie <i>Days of Heaven</i> because he insisted on filming only during this time of day, but the results perfectly capture and distend that dizzy, overripe feeling of right before something very good ends.<i> Bloom</i><span style=""font-style: normal;""> does that, too. ""What comes after this momentary bliss?"" Legrand wonders on ""Myth"". It's a question Beach House don't seem interested in answering any time soon. Because that's become their signature magic trick: stopping time right before the sun disappears over the horizon, tricking you into believing a feeling can last forever.</span></p></div>"|16604.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16604-beach-house-bloom/|9.1|Lindsay Zoladz

His albums suffered when the melodies and arrangements were precise and exactingly purposeful, leading Paul Thompson to decry 2009's <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13467-year-in-the-kingdom/"">Year in the Kingdom</a></i> for its ""lonesome, somber tone, one Tillman-- a funny, amicable dude, if you've ever heard him clowning on himself at a Fleet Foxes gig-- would do well to shake on occasion."" Whether intentionally or not, Tillman has responded to this kind of criticism with his eighth album and his first under the name <a href=""http://fatherjohnmisty.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Father John Misty</a>. Perhaps freed by the new pseudonym or emboldened by his nearly four-year tenure as a Fleet Fox, Tillman varies things up on <i>Fear Fun</i>, reveals an adventurous palette, and makes what may be his best album to date. He's finally shaken that lonesome, somber tone, and these songs sound all the better for it: gregarious, engaging, even funny.</p>
<p>It can't hurt that he ditched Seattle for warmer, stranger climes. After a period of deep depression, he loaded up his van with shrooms and drove down the coast, finally settling in what he describes as a ""spider-shack"" in Laurel Canyon. Of course, Tillman is aware of that locale's revered place in pop history and of Greater Los Angeles' less reputable place in pop culture, and he lets them inform <i>Fear Fun</i> musically, lyrically, and conceptually. Even that new moniker, Father John Misty, sounds like a cult leader, keeping his flock sequestered in an old movie set up in the hills. And the lyrics suggest a Hollywood breakdown of epic proportions, loosely recounting his own walkabout with the sort of mischief and humor largely missing from his previous albums. He opens ""I'm Writing a Novel"" with a great first sentence: ""I ran down the road, pants down to my knees, screaming,/ 'Please come help me, that Canadian shaman gave a little too much to me!'"" It bodes well for his novel.</p>
<p><i>Fear Fun </i>isn't merely a step forward lyrically; it also reveals new musical ambitions. Compared to his previous albums, it's positively kaleidoscopic: less content to be moody and pretty and more intent on getting up in your face. Tillman's warped interpretations and strange combinations of SoCal pop history seem to mirror his own narcotized state: With its billowy strings and triangle beat, ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/1905-nancy-from-now-on/"" target=""_blank"">Nancy From Now On""</a> could be Laurel Canyon disco, a mad-scientist hybrid that proves a perfect setting for his careening falsetto. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13075-hollywood-forever-cemetery-sings/"">""Hollywood Forever Cemetery Sings""</a> is a Sunset Strip stomp slowed down to a near idle, and the countrified ""Well, You Can Do It Without Me"" finds Gram Parsons' headstone somewhere in Bakersfield. Every song has its own identity, and the album's slightly fractured vibe speaks volumes about the place that inspired it.</p>
<p>If there's a criticism to be made about the music, it's that it sounds a bit too composed and too contained to really sell the drug-fueled anarchy and municipal depravity. The arrangements entertain a rhythmic stiffness that sticks strictly to the beat, without any syncopation to suggest the messy experiences Tillman's lyrics evoke. He really only cuts loose on the rambling ""I'm Writing a Novel"" and the psych-absurdist ""Tee Pees 1-12"", which are the album's clear highlights. He's never sounded looser, weirder, or funnier than when he's recovering from a bad, pantsless trip or when he's reading Richard Brautigan to impress a woman. ""If I make it out alive from Hollywood and Vine/ I'll build a cabin up in the Northwest,"" he sings on ""Tee Pees 1-12"", but hopefully it's an empty threat: By relocating to the land of Kardashians and Orange Housewives, Tillman has discovered his truest subject.</p></div>"|16597.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16597-fear-fun/|7.3|Stephen M.

I'm not sure whether to call it drive or vision or presence, but something makes even her calmest moments propel forward and grab attention. She's kept that focus through <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/artist/Motion+Sickness+Of+Time+Travel"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">many</a> LPs, cassettes, CD-R's, and split releases, carving a path that's open to all sounds yet has a clear direction.</p>
<p>Her next step on that path feels like the destination she's been traveling toward all along. Plainly titled and simply structured-- each of its four tracks take up an LP side-- <i>Motion Sickness of Time Travel</i> is a definitive 90 minutes of music that needs no novel angle or overt theme to hold interest. Which is not to say that it merely sums up what Evans has done before. There are new approaches here, the most noticeable being a shift from gritty, murky atmospheres to a cleaner, smoother sound.</p>
<p>So what makes <i>Motion Sickness of Time Travel</i> definitive is not the qualities on its surface, but the confidence at its core. All kinds of moods and tones seem easily within Evans' reach, so she never has to worry about sustaining intensity over a 25-minute album side, or about picking a sound that's too light or too dark, too simple or too complicated. Bubbles, ripples, chirps, hums, moans: Many of the familiar sounds of ambient music are here, and Evans boldly breathes new life into them. They pulse and flow even when there's no discernible rhythm or movement. Her assuredness is reflected in simple, direct song titles: ""The Dream"", ""The Center"", ""One Perfect Moment"". And it allows Evans to journey around the sonic map without losing her way.</p>
<p>In drone-based music there's often a fine line between sticking to one mode beyond its expiration point and pivoting prematurely out of fear of losing impatient listeners. But Evans' changes all feel natural, and the album's variety comes off as earned rather than contrived. When she drifts from whirring notes into wavy tones halfway through ""The Dream"", or when she sings in words you can actually make out (a rarity for her) near the end of <a href=""https://vimeo.com/41126588"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Center""</a>, these moves seem logical, even inevitable. Comparisons are tempting-- after I listen, I think of the drift of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4605-windy-carl/"">Windy &amp; Carl</a>, the flights of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11388-terry-riley/"">Terry Riley</a>, and the soar of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28293-emeralds/"">Emeralds</a>, whose John Elliott runs Spectrum Spools. But while the record's playing, Evans' own musical personality is what commands my attention.</p>
<p>It's also tempting to call this music ""spiritual,"" as its high-pitched, ethereal sound calls to mind religious hymns or New Age mysticism. But to me <i>Motion Sickness of Time Travel</i> evokes a different sense of spirit-- the kind of inner presence that separates humans from machines. Often drones can feel cold or automated, as if the gear were doing the work and the musician were just a conduit or a witness. That can produce interesting art too, but Evans' music is different. There's a guiding force behind it, a sense that everything happens for a reason. And that's not religion, because <i>Motion Sickness of Time Travel</i> is less about higher power than human power, and the way it can turn inanimate sound into moving experience.</p></div>"|16594.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16594-motion-sickness-of-time-travel/|8.3|Marc Masters

Knopf, the guy who introduced the Digital Looping Recorder to Menomena, has a longstanding fascination with the tensions between the natural and the mechanical. The intricately arranged album is a good showcase for Knopf's cut-and-paste perfectionism; <i>Prophet</i>, like 2009's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13418-intuit/"" target=""_blank""><i>Intuit</i></a>, is vast and symphonic one moment, stark and intimate the next. As his music grows grander, though, Knopf's human side gets a little lost amidst all the elaborate knob-and-wire work.</p>
<p class=""p1"">It's next to impossible to suss out exactly who's doing what in Menomena's hypercollaborative, every-which-way songs, an approach Knopf's carried over to the more pastoral, less proggy Ramona Falls. <i>Intuit</i> found Knopf calling on friends across the indie rock spectrum, offering little indication as to which bleep or rumble came from where; <i>Prophet</i>'s guest list is pared down considerably, but the new effect's still the same. No matter who's doing the playing, this is Knopf's show; he's the one wrangling all this swirling stuff into songs, his voice in the center of it all. As on <i>Intuit</i>, the sound of <i>Prophet</i> is exceptionally fussy but sumptuous, all these widescreen vistas of richly detailed sound. Any music this intricately arranged is at constant risk of bloodlessness, but Knopf's got a flair for juxtaposition that plays the synthetic off the organic in such a way that feels very much alive. But all the effort Knopf's expended on instrumental complexities often seems to crowd out the person at the center of it all; as he himself says on opener ""Bodies of Water"", ""I have to, have to, have to let go of total control,"" and too often, the sonic intricacies overwhelm Knopf's voice.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Knopf does plenty of singing here, but it's rare that he lets his voice serve as the focal point of the songs. On <i>Intuit</i>, the expansive arrangements and Knopf's intimate vocals worked in tandem, but here, the balance has shifted, and Prophet's musical enormity, gorgeous as it is, overshadows for Knopf's alternately delicate and disjointed lyrics. Almost any hint of vulnerability Knopf spikes with a kind of detached sci-fi or yet another instrumental detour. ""What I'd give if you'd feel my love,"" he delivers with just the right kind of tenderness, but what that heart-on-sleeve sentiment has to do with ""Archimedes Plutonium"" is anybody's guess. And whatever's meant by that initial hint of sweetness seems, over time, to almost dislodge itself from the song. Throughout <i>Prophet</i>, he seems to be suggesting just how small one person is in this big old universe of ours. But Knopf's taken his own ego-whittling a few steps too far, as though he'd really rather let the dramatic sonics do the talking for him. There just seems a little too much distance between Knopf and the emotions he's trying to convey-- galaxies' worth, in the case of ""Spore""-- and the effect proves weirdly unaffecting, almost alien. Prophet's widescreen music is wonderful to listen to; it's just hard to really feel.</p></div>"|16610.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16610-prophet/|6.5|Paul Thompson

But theirs is a more ebullient take on the genre. The filling-rattling rave-ups stay, but the bad vibes are mostly jettisoned. And the Chris Cornell-style shirtless heaving, well, that gets left to their alterna-riffing buddies and Charm City neighbors, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29803-dope-body/"" target=""_blank"">Dope Body</a>.</p>
<p><i>Super Vague</i> is Roomrunner's second release, following a self-titled cassette and download-only EP that arrived late last year, also on <a href=""http://fandeathrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fan Death</a>. The needle hasn't moved much during the interim. From a sonic standpoint, <i>Super Vague</i> is virtually identical to its predecessor. Dan Frome, who recorded both releases and also plays guitar, has made a careful study of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13686-bleach-deluxe-edition-live-at-reading/"" target=""_blank""><i>Bleach</i></a>-era production, cranking up the guitars and keeping the low-end frequencies brittle. <span><br/></span></p>
<p>But Bowen, who writes the songs and plays the majority of the music on the recordings, has tightened up his approach. On <i>Super Vague</i>, Roomrunner ping-pong between their grimy riffs with newly tour-honed panache. The <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13250-super-vague/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a> careens face-first into a nest of power chords. ""Undo"" makes maximal use of the loud-quiet-loud dynamic change, pivoting from a thin and detuned guitar riff to full-on noise-rock gristle. ""No Wait"" re-engineers the band's pounding rhythms and knotty math-rock moves. ""Petrified"" is a blown-out rehearsal tape that could have slotted comfortably into the second disc of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7345-dirty-deluxe-edition/"" target=""_blank"">Sonic Youth's <i>Dirty</i> reissue</a>. More than anything, Bowen knows how to stack up the notes to get the heaviest chords. Major and minor tonalities are irrelevant.</p>
<p>Roomrunner wear their grunge debts proudly, even going so far as to spoof an old-school <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TDHw3SQosI"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sub Pop promo ad</a> to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqbpaGVjC0s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">promote their tour</a> behind <i>Super Vague</i>. But the band's take on the 90s is more of a fantasy reboot than a strict recreation. Several elements of their hometown sound have dripped into the mix, from eerily processed vocals to the blurry guitar slop and proggy rhythmic sensibility. Ideas harvested straight from the Pacific Northwest are retro-fit with weirder impulses-- a youth spent cherishing <i>The Colour and the Shape</i> smacking straight into an adulthood spent jamming to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4431-us-maple/"" target=""_blank"">U.S. Maple</a>'s atonal squiggles. The element that's most noticeably absent from Roomrunner's throwback pallete is rage. Not that it's totally missed. Angst and bitterness were a potent part of grunge, but were often wearying when plied by anybody who wasn't named Kurt Cobain. Besides, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2860-mudhoney/"" target=""_blank"">Mudhoney</a> had an awesome sense of humor.</p>
<p>And in concert Roomrunner destroy. Literally. The band's sets are frequently brought to a close in a fit of vintage-amp and drumset torture. At the freaky arm-waving height of charismatic church services, sometimes worshippers will jump out of their pews to sprint a few spirit-fueled laps around the pulpit. It's kind of a tragedy that this isn't where the band's name comes from (it's actually taken from the Japanese term for ""treadmill""). But a secular version of this ecstatic freak-out moment is more or less Roomrunner's constant destination. Were it 1991, Geffen would be paying attention.</p></div>"|16607.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16607-roomrunner-super-vague/|7.9|Aaron Leitko

I'm holding the CDs right now, and I can tell you, they exist. The remasters of <a href=""http://www.mybloodyvalentine.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">My Bloody Valentine</a>'s Creation catalog had been announced and delayed so many times, it became a running joke to ask which would come first, the <i>Loveless</i> remasters or the long-awaited <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46058-kevin-shields-teases-new-my-bloody-valentine-lp/"" target=""_blank"">follow-up</a>. The inferred punchline was ""neither."" Advance copies circulated four years ago, but the leaks came and went and no one was sure if they were real. Turns out they were. And now you can buy them. They're available only in the UK for now, but yes, the My Bloody Valentine remasters exist.</p>
<p>In addition to new masters of <i>Isn't Anything</i> and <i>Loveless</i>, there's also a new My Bloody Valentine release, of a sort. <i>EPs 1988-1991</i> collects four EPs and a single issued during the band’s creative peak, along with previously unreleased (but widely bootlegged) tracks. This release provides the greatest revelation. Imbibing this material in one large gulp feels like a new window into the band's brilliance. <i>You Made Me Realise</i>, originally released in 1988, is a perennial on any list of the greatest EPs of all time and it vastly improves upon their earlier work. They had experimented with guitar noise, but they'd never succeeded in making something like the title track, which walked a razor's edge between bliss and terror. Kevin Shields was a great admirer of the Beatles' flair for melody, but he'd never written a tune as breezy and memorable as ""Thorn"". And nothing they'd done before sounded as effortless as ""Drive It All Over Me"". They were finally a real rock band, with pulsing bass and brisk tempos and guitars that sound like guitars.</p>
<p>By late 1988, Shields put together an extended single and an album that secured MBV's status as guitar-pop innovators. The untitled single that featured ""Feed Me With Your Kiss"" (it was also released as a four-song EP, all songs are included here) found them becoming sweeter and yet more dissonant, essentially pushing every which way in the general direction of ""more."" If ""Feed Me With Your Kiss"" and ""I Believe"" can't quite match anything on <i>Realise</i>, they at least hinted that an even wider emotional range was within this band's grasp.</p>
<p><i>Isn't Anything</i>, a singular item in the My Bloody Valentine discography, is the fulfillment of this promise. For some fans, it's the band's pinnacle. It's alternately dark and slow and joyously effervescent; on fast-tempo songs like ""Nothing Much to Lose"" and ""Sueisfine"", drummer Colm Ó Coísóig adds Keith Moon-like fills to the end of every bar. On slower songs like ""Lose My Breath"" and ""No More Sorry"", the guitars clang and rattle and MBV seem effortlessly dark and goth, having finally found a way to convey mood without forgoing song.</p>
<p>Even more than the greatness of the individual tracks, <i>Isn't Anything</i> crystallizes MBV's unique dynamic. It's an essential document in the noise-pop sphere that was by then already called shoegaze, and much of MBV's influence can be found here rather than on <i>Loveless</i>. But it's also distinctly the work of this one band. At the heart of My Bloody Valentine was the mixture of the crushing power of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"" target=""_blank"">Dinosaur Jr.</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8693-husker-du/"" target=""_blank"">Hüsker Dü</a> and the delicate vulnerability of indie pop; the masculine/feminine dynamic was accomplished not through the brilliant interplay between Kevin Shields and singer/guitarist Bilinda Butcher (whose voices complement each other but often sound quite alike) but by the effect of their voices against the guitar noise. My Bloody Valentine offered a new expression of androgynous sensuality in pop, crafting deeply sexual but also abstracted music, short on specifics but heavy with feeling. And <i>Isn't Anything</i> is where this combination came into full flower. The swooning drone of ""All I Need"" points directly at what was to come on <i>Loveless</i>, but <i>Isn't Anything</i> needn't exist in relationship to another record. If they had stopped here, My Bloody Valentine's reputation would have been assured. Fortunately, they didn't. Another landmark was around the corner.</p>
<p>But before they got there, MBV offered two more EPs, both found on the 1988-1991 collection. <i>Glider</i>, from 1990, displayed a massive shift in sound from anything they'd done before. The opening single ""Soon"" was a sensation, famously described by Brian Eno as ""a new standard for pop. It's the vaguest music ever to have been a hit."" That vagueness is the key to all that would follow, because Shields was taking his early ideas and seeing how far he could push them into the realm of texture and pure sensation. So ""Soon"", with its drum break and chord changes and melody, sounds like a ""song"" on the one hand, but everything is blurred until it seems more like a ghosted memory of a song. And this mistiness happens without losing any of its propulsive force or the shock of the noise when the guitars enter. Clearly, things were very different for My Bloody Valentine.</p>
<p><i>Glider</i> was rounded out by the instrumental title track, which serves as a showcase for how Shields was using phase shifts and disorienting rhythm tricks to create an underlying sense of unease mixed with awe. It sounds slightly ""wrong"" but also gorgeous, and like little else that had come before. MBV's following EP, <i>Tremolo</i>, upped the ante further. It stands as the true companion to <i>Loveless</i>. Opening with the staggering ""To Here Knows When"", it takes the woozy disorientation of ""Glider"" and mixes it with a vocal from Butcher that is impossibly ethereal. It feels constantly on the verge of breaking apart, which imparts a deep feeling of tension, as bruising distortion meets child-like coo. Both ""Swallow"", with its looped hand drums and Celtic synth line, and the crushing ""Honey Power"" match the best of <i>Loveless</i> for sheer beauty.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, a perfectionist like Kevin Shields isn't the sort to have unreleased greatness lingering in the vault, and that holds true for the bonus material that fills out the EP collection. ""Instrumental 1"" mixes drum breaks and guitar noise and sounds less like indications of a possible new direction and more like a tame example of a lot of the music it inspired. The 10-minute-long version of ""Glider"" is welcome, as it's built on the sort of hypnotic repetition you wish would go on forever. But better are the crunchy pop tunes at the tail end of the disc-- ""Sugar"", ""Angel"", ""Good for You""-- which complement to the superior material on the EPs.</p>
<p><i>Tremolo</i> came out in March, leaving a seven-month wait before <i>Loveless</i> made it into the world that November (six weeks after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15854-nevermind-20th-anniversary-edition/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana's <i>Nevermind</i></a>). To say that anticipation for <i>Loveless</i> was high would be an understatement, and it delivered in every conceivable way. Few pop albums are routinely described in religious terms but this is one of them. It's partly because, like any scripture worth its salt, it leaves itself open to interpretation. Going back to that Eno quote, there's no telling what many of these songs ""mean,"" even after you've read the lyrics. They bypass the language center of the brain and head for other areas-- where memory, tactile sensation, and emotions lie. It's an album you feel more than one you understand.</p>
<p>By this time, Kevin Shields was less a bandleader than a mad scientist, constantly developing and tinkering with new sounds. He played virtually every instrument (the lone exception being Ó Coísóig's minute-long ""Touched"") and obsessively tinkered with the smallest details. And the genius of <i>Loveless</i> is its mix, the exact proportions of one sound to the next. The highlights that led off the two EPs are the tentpoles, but really, <i>Loveless</i> is all highlights. I've heard many thousands of albums in my life and it's one of the few that strikes me as being essentially perfect. It's also the album that has turned two generations on to the wondrous possibilities of sound <i>as</i> sound. It's hard to imagine someone like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1477-fennesz/"" target=""_blank"">Fennesz</a> getting anywhere near as much traction among indie music fans if <i>Loveless</i> hadn't taught them how to listen for the emotional possibilities of texture. It remains a landmark that hasn't aged a day.</p>
<p>Which leads to one of the many strange and ironic things about this particular reissue: Perfection is offered in two competing versions. <i>Loveless</i> comes in a 2xCD set, one remastered from the original DAT and one from the original analog master. We may never fully understand the reasoning behind this unusual decision. As has been <a href=""http://thepowerofindependenttrucking.blogspot.ca/2012/05/mbv-loveless-2012-remasters.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pointed out elsewhere</a>, it's possible that the two discs are mislabeled, and that the half-inch analog master is identified as coming from the DAT and vice versa. Which is neither here nor there when you consider that no one in their right mind would ask themselves, ""Which <i>Loveless</i> remaster should I listen to tonight?""</p>
<p>Shields says that the effect of the differences is cumulative and best understood over the course of a full listen. Having listened to the CDs on three different pairs of headphones and two different stereo systems of varying quality, I can say that they are <i>slightly</i> different (one is just a hair louder) but the qualitative distinctions are extremely minimal, at best. And there is a digital glitch on ""What You Want"" on one of the remasters, which seems both comical and tragic considering how long these have been in the works. So I guess I'll be listening to the one without the mistake, then.</p>
<p>Aside from that detail, the remastering across all three sets is well done. <i>Loveless</i> was famously and appropriately one of the quietest ""loud"" records of all time. Listening on your iPod, you always have the volume close to max and you never feel like you damage your hearing. And this breathing room pays off in spades in the dynamics of the record; when the guitars surge on ""Soon"" and ""Only Shallow"", it can still shake you to your core.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that this music exists and probably sounds as good as it ever will. As a band and as an idea, My Bloody Valentine stand for many things: sonic perfectionism, outsized ambition, excess. But the quality they embody above all is patience. They make you wait-- for the follow-up to brilliant albums, for the remastered versions of those brilliant albums, for that D-chord in the extended live versions of ""You Made Me Realise"" to finally come to an end. Some bands give you everything you want right when you want it; with My Bloody Valentine, you have to come to them and experience the music on their terms. But the demands they make don't preclude generosity. In fact, they reward your commitment many times over. For years, Kevin Shields has discussed his difficulties in following up <i>Loveless</i>. The talk often centers around money-- how he was not given what was promised, how he lacked the resources to bring the music to life and get it out into the world. These releases will set you back a few bucks, but My Bloody Valentine's output during their miracle years between 1988 and 1991 also stands outside of commerce. It feels like a gift, still.</p></div>"|16605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16605-isnt-anything-reissue-loveless-reissue-eps-1988-1991/|10.0|Mark Richardson

I'm holding the CDs right now, and I can tell you, they exist. The remasters of <a href=""http://www.mybloodyvalentine.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">My Bloody Valentine</a>'s Creation catalog had been announced and delayed so many times, it became a running joke to ask which would come first, the <i>Loveless</i> remasters or the long-awaited <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/46058-kevin-shields-teases-new-my-bloody-valentine-lp/"" target=""_blank"">follow-up</a>. The inferred punchline was ""neither."" Advance copies circulated four years ago, but the leaks came and went and no one was sure if they were real. Turns out they were. And now you can buy them. They're available only in the UK for now, but yes, the My Bloody Valentine remasters exist.</p>
<p>In addition to new masters of <i>Isn't Anything</i> and <i>Loveless</i>, there's also a new My Bloody Valentine release, of a sort. <i>EPs 1988-1991</i> collects four EPs and a single issued during the band’s creative peak, along with previously unreleased (but widely bootlegged) tracks. This release provides the greatest revelation. Imbibing this material in one large gulp feels like a new window into the band's brilliance. <i>You Made Me Realise</i>, originally released in 1988, is a perennial on any list of the greatest EPs of all time and it vastly improves upon their earlier work. They had experimented with guitar noise, but they'd never succeeded in making something like the title track, which walked a razor's edge between bliss and terror. Kevin Shields was a great admirer of the Beatles' flair for melody, but he'd never written a tune as breezy and memorable as ""Thorn"". And nothing they'd done before sounded as effortless as ""Drive It All Over Me"". They were finally a real rock band, with pulsing bass and brisk tempos and guitars that sound like guitars.</p>
<p>By late 1988, Shields put together an extended single and an album that secured MBV's status as guitar-pop innovators. The untitled single that featured ""Feed Me With Your Kiss"" (it was also released as a four-song EP, all songs are included here) found them becoming sweeter and yet more dissonant, essentially pushing every which way in the general direction of ""more."" If ""Feed Me With Your Kiss"" and ""I Believe"" can't quite match anything on <i>Realise</i>, they at least hinted that an even wider emotional range was within this band's grasp.</p>
<p><i>Isn't Anything</i>, a singular item in the My Bloody Valentine discography, is the fulfillment of this promise. For some fans, it's the band's pinnacle. It's alternately dark and slow and joyously effervescent; on fast-tempo songs like ""Nothing Much to Lose"" and ""Sueisfine"", drummer Colm Ó Coísóig adds Keith Moon-like fills to the end of every bar. On slower songs like ""Lose My Breath"" and ""No More Sorry"", the guitars clang and rattle and MBV seem effortlessly dark and goth, having finally found a way to convey mood without forgoing song.</p>
<p>Even more than the greatness of the individual tracks, <i>Isn't Anything</i> crystallizes MBV's unique dynamic. It's an essential document in the noise-pop sphere that was by then already called shoegaze, and much of MBV's influence can be found here rather than on <i>Loveless</i>. But it's also distinctly the work of this one band. At the heart of My Bloody Valentine was the mixture of the crushing power of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1087-dinosaur-jr/"" target=""_blank"">Dinosaur Jr.</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/8693-husker-du/"" target=""_blank"">Hüsker Dü</a> and the delicate vulnerability of indie pop; the masculine/feminine dynamic was accomplished not through the brilliant interplay between Kevin Shields and singer/guitarist Bilinda Butcher (whose voices complement each other but often sound quite alike) but by the effect of their voices against the guitar noise. My Bloody Valentine offered a new expression of androgynous sensuality in pop, crafting deeply sexual but also abstracted music, short on specifics but heavy with feeling. And <i>Isn't Anything</i> is where this combination came into full flower. The swooning drone of ""All I Need"" points directly at what was to come on <i>Loveless</i>, but <i>Isn't Anything</i> needn't exist in relationship to another record. If they had stopped here, My Bloody Valentine's reputation would have been assured. Fortunately, they didn't. Another landmark was around the corner.</p>
<p>But before they got there, MBV offered two more EPs, both found on the 1988-1991 collection. <i>Glider</i>, from 1990, displayed a massive shift in sound from anything they'd done before. The opening single ""Soon"" was a sensation, famously described by Brian Eno as ""a new standard for pop. It's the vaguest music ever to have been a hit."" That vagueness is the key to all that would follow, because Shields was taking his early ideas and seeing how far he could push them into the realm of texture and pure sensation. So ""Soon"", with its drum break and chord changes and melody, sounds like a ""song"" on the one hand, but everything is blurred until it seems more like a ghosted memory of a song. And this mistiness happens without losing any of its propulsive force or the shock of the noise when the guitars enter. Clearly, things were very different for My Bloody Valentine.</p>
<p><i>Glider</i> was rounded out by the instrumental title track, which serves as a showcase for how Shields was using phase shifts and disorienting rhythm tricks to create an underlying sense of unease mixed with awe. It sounds slightly ""wrong"" but also gorgeous, and like little else that had come before. MBV's following EP, <i>Tremolo</i>, upped the ante further. It stands as the true companion to <i>Loveless</i>. Opening with the staggering ""To Here Knows When"", it takes the woozy disorientation of ""Glider"" and mixes it with a vocal from Butcher that is impossibly ethereal. It feels constantly on the verge of breaking apart, which imparts a deep feeling of tension, as bruising distortion meets child-like coo. Both ""Swallow"", with its looped hand drums and Celtic synth line, and the crushing ""Honey Power"" match the best of <i>Loveless</i> for sheer beauty.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, a perfectionist like Kevin Shields isn't the sort to have unreleased greatness lingering in the vault, and that holds true for the bonus material that fills out the EP collection. ""Instrumental 1"" mixes drum breaks and guitar noise and sounds less like indications of a possible new direction and more like a tame example of a lot of the music it inspired. The 10-minute-long version of ""Glider"" is welcome, as it's built on the sort of hypnotic repetition you wish would go on forever. But better are the crunchy pop tunes at the tail end of the disc-- ""Sugar"", ""Angel"", ""Good for You""-- which complement to the superior material on the EPs.</p>
<p><i>Tremolo</i> came out in March, leaving a seven-month wait before <i>Loveless</i> made it into the world that November (six weeks after <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15854-nevermind-20th-anniversary-edition/"" target=""_blank"">Nirvana's <i>Nevermind</i></a>). To say that anticipation for <i>Loveless</i> was high would be an understatement, and it delivered in every conceivable way. Few pop albums are routinely described in religious terms but this is one of them. It's partly because, like any scripture worth its salt, it leaves itself open to interpretation. Going back to that Eno quote, there's no telling what many of these songs ""mean,"" even after you've read the lyrics.

Some bands give you everything you want right when you want it; with My Bloody Valentine, you have to come to them and experience the music on their terms. But the demands they make don't preclude generosity. In fact, they reward your commitment many times over. For years, Kevin Shields has discussed his difficulties in following up <i>Loveless</i>. The talk often centers around money-- how he was not given what was promised, how he lacked the resources to bring the music to life and get it out into the world. These releases will set you back a few bucks, but My Bloody Valentine's output during their miracle years between 1988 and 1991 also stands outside of commerce. It feels like a gift, still.</p></div>"|16605.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16605-isnt-anything-reissue-loveless-reissue-eps-1988-1991/|9.5|Mark Richardson

A half century past its born-on date, in the midst of yet another uptick in interest in the scuzzy stuff, and even the best of garage rock's new breed's not exactly long on surprises; the cream of this particular crop, as our Jayson Greene rightly <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16558-ty-segall-white-fence-hair/"" target=""_blank"">noted</a> a week back, ""plays upon beloved memories while confusing them,"" but the worst of it simply seems to content itself with rehashing of somebody else's past glories. Get 20 seconds into ""Never Again"", opening chugger of Royal Headache's 2011 self-titled debut (just reissued in the States), and you may find yourself wondering whether you're in for another rotely rollicking, backward-facing fuzz assault. Seconds later, Shogun opens his mouth and, well, you won't be wondering that much longer.</p>
<p>Soul's a tough one to quantify, one of music's true know-it-when-you-hear-it propositions. But this Shogun character's got soul, no doubt about it. His voice-- warm, urgent, overloaded with feeling-- comes on like a house on fire, harkening back to the grit and grain of Faces-era Rod Stewart and Sam Cooke at the Harlem Square Club, several shades more complex and adaptable than your typical throat-shredding three-chorded truth-teller. It's a wonderfully lived-in, schtick-free, era-defying thing; along with Rod and Sam, young Roger Daltrey, <i>Argybargy</i>-era Glenn Tilbrook, and even Bob Pollard edge their way into the frame, but what Shogun's doing is hardly some studious reading of all these greats. As Shortty rightly claims, it just seems to come out that way, the kind of thing you just can't fake. Sure, Shogun sings the hell out of these songs, but every line's imbued with real emotion, and even when he's jamming stanzas with a couple-three too many words, his meaning's never less than crystal-clear. That, too, is soul.</p>
<p>Shogun's assuredly the centerpiece here, but sub him out for somebody else, and Royal Headache's songs would still stand fairly tall. For every economy-ridden post-Ramones thrasher like ""Back and Forth"", there's a shambolically stately, wordless breath-catcher like ""Wilson Street"" or a misty-eyed yearner like ""Distant and Vague"", which sounds for all the world like the kind of song the Beatles would've covered in their Hamburg days. These performances-- lo-fi without sloppiness, reined-in without losing their rollicking edge-- provide a rock-solid counterpoint for Shogun's hollers and croons. The whole record's got a bristling, live-in-a-room feel, and vocally, there's almost nothing in the way of harmonizing. Shogun, front-and-center on every track but the instrumental, has it covered all by himself.</p>
<p><i>Royal Headache</i>'s 26 minutes go by quickly, and while it's not all run-and-gun pacing, another ballad (or another ""Wilson Street"") might have helped a bit with the balance. And, as with any innovation-averse music like this, there's a rousing game of spot the influence to be played if you think you can keep up. But the inclusive, ebullient Royal Headache's simply having too much fun in the present to ever let the past get in their way. ""Honey Joy""-- the highest of <i>Royal Headache</i>'s many highs-- finds an exuberant Shogun shouting, ""honey joy, honey joy, honey joy, boys,"" a line that, typed out, doesn't look like much of anything. But Shogun, like Brenton Wood in ""The Oogum Boogum Song"" or Otis Redding in ""Happy Song (Dum-Dum)"", manages to turn that little sliver of nonsense into a pint-hoisting, mates-toasting embrace. ""It just comes out,"" you say? By all means, keep it coming.</p></div>"|16599.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16599-royal-headache/|8.0|Paul Thompson

Apartment blocks shoot toward the heavens, spilling over with bored and persecuted citizens. Unemployment rates are high. The crime rate is even higher. Forget about buying coffee-- it's been outlawed as an illegal stimulant. Patrolling the streets are a series of fascistic Judges, employed to keep the peace by any means necessary. It makes the <i>Blade Runner</i> universe look like Disneyland. At least, that's how the makers of popular Brit comic <a href=""http://www.2000adonline.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>2000 AD</i></a> imagine it, as told through the eyes of their most famous character, the granite-jawed Judge Dredd. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3374-portishead/"">Portishead</a>'s <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7210-geoff-barrow/"">Geoff Barrow</a> was a kid who, like me, grew up devouring this world, buying <i>2000 AD</i> week after week to see which perp was going to end up on the business end of Dredd's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawgiver_(Judge_Dredd)"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lawgiver</a>. <i>DROKK</i> is Barrow's tribute to Mega-City One, coming out of a series of sessions with Emmy-nominated composer <a href=""http://bensalisbury.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ben Salisbury</a>.</p>
<p>Dredd is the kind of character who continues to leave a vivid imprint on the minds of successive generations of comic book fans, but he's been remarkably ill-served when removed from the confines of <i>2000 AD</i>. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLMRQshGqU4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Fink Brothers</a>' musical tribute to Mega-City One, and Sylvester Stallone's hacky 1995 interpretation of Dredd, are best forgotten. Despite this, hopes for Pete Travis' forthcoming big-budget adaptation, simply titled <i>Dredd</i>, are reasonably high. Even Barrow, who began this project with Salisbury to provide the soundtrack to Travis' film, only to find their work left on the cutting room floor, <a href=""http://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/features/301804-geoff_barrow_talks_drokk_2000ad_as_important_me_public_enemy"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">said</a> he thought the feature was going to be ""fucking brilliant."" But <i>Dredd</i> will feel less foreboding without their music. Armed with three vintage Oberheim two-voice synths, the pair reaches into the grubby, blackened heart of Mega-City One, via a soundtrack flooded with the kind of trepidation that classic <i>2000 AD</i> artists like Brian Bolland so often conjured up.</p>
<p><i>DROKK</i> reveals Barrow's comic book fandom, but it also highlights his taste in soundtracks. There's no escaping the specter of John Carpenter hanging over these tracks, especially his drone-heavy <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074156/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Assault on Precinct 13</i></a> score. But there's a relentless darkness at work here that even Carpenter might shy away from dipping into. The <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082340/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Escape From New York</i></a> theme had a sanguine beauty to it, but Barrow and Salisbury lock into an obdurate form of austerity early on (""Lawmaster/Pursuit"", ""Helmet Theme"") and never let the tension drop. Mostly, the atmosphere is meat-locker cold (""Scope the Block"", ""Clone Gunman""), and while it never reaches the extremities of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4765-whitehouse/"">Whitehouse</a> or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4229-throbbing-gristle/"">Throbbing Gristle</a>, it bears a similar kind of ornery undertow. Occasionally they work in pure drones, adding a portentous type of beauty to tracks like ""Exhale"" and ""Iso Hymn"", making it feel like all the air just got sucked out of the room.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it's not hard to hear traces of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5612-vangelis/"">Vangelis</a>' soundtrack to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/""><i>Blade Runner</i></a> and the work <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4171-tangerine-dream/"">Tangerine Dream</a> carried out for Kathryn Bigelow's <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093605/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Near Dark</i></a>. Like those albums, the music on <i>DROKK</i> provides a definite sense of journey, a feeling that we're being tangled up in plot twists that unravel, conclude, and maybe leave a few questions open at the end. Soundtracks that work well often create a strong sense of narrative when isolated from the visuals they're representing, and <i>DROKK</i> functions in much the same manner. It's even easy to picture the credits scrolling over ""End Theme"". Sadly, we'll never see Dredd gliding through the city on his <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_technology_in_Judge_Dredd#Lawmaster"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lawmaster</a> while the pummeling ""Titan Bound"" echoes through a multiplex. But maybe it's better that way. Instead, this album provides Dredd fans with a chance to fix this music to their own favorite stories, giving the unrelenting decay and despair of Mega-City One the ferociously solemn musical backdrop it's always deserved.</p></div>"|16600.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16600-drokk-music-inspired-by-mega-city-one/|6.7|Nick Neyland

After all, he's working within a steady subgenre where supply almost always outstrips demand, triangulating pop within ""indie-,"" ""synth-,"" and ""mope-"" prefixes-- essentially, makeout music for loners. But <i>Idle Labor </i>did manage to distinguish itself, and both the title and the content of the sweet love hangover <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/15278-after-the-moment/"" target=""_blank"">""After the Moment""</a> illustrated how. Beneath the sonic cohesion of <i>Idle Labor </i>was a narrative arc guided by the emotional immediacy of Vallesteros' writing-- whether it was butterflies or heartache, it didn't sound like he gave himself much lead time to process his feelings. In other words, it encapsulated an entire relationship that could've ended 30 minutes prior to its recording. </p>
<p>But like most debut albums that appear to heavily draw from autobiographical romantic turbulence, it leads to the question of whether Vallesteros already exhausted his best material. <i>Gallery EP </i>is a follow-up that evades that question by pretending it's not being asked. He just makes more Craft Spells songs that could've easily served as deep cuts on <i>Idle Labor </i>or the basis for a worryingly similar follow-up, and without anything that pops like ""After the Moment"" or plays into a broader lyrical scope, Vallesteros relies more on his debut's goodwill to distinguish itself rather than its own merits.</p>
<p>Despite taking <i>Idle Labor </i>on the road, <i>Gallery </i>is still a solo recording made of the same constituent elements-- glistening guitar treble, rudimentary drum machines pounding out patterns a little too jittery and stiff for human hands, occasional pop-funk affectations, insatiable pining, and Vallesteros' sonorous vocals-- something like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2590-jens-lekman/"" target=""_blank"">Jens Lekman</a> with less range and polish but still an effective tool. His melodic sensibilities could be described as such, too: Opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13223-still-left-with-me/"" target=""_blank"">""Still Left With Me""</a> digs away with little subtlety, voice and guitar doubling each other to drive a simple, singsong hook home. On the subsequent track, he sings, ""warmth consumes me,"" which simultaneously feels like a romantic ideal for Vallesteros as a lyricist and an artistic one for Craft Spells' imperfect and humane electronics. ""Burst"" is the closest Craft Spells get to no-qualifiers pop, but the handcrafted production for once feels like a limitation instead of an atmospheric choice-- if the bass had the depth to sound rounded rather than blocky and the acoustic guitars had sparkle instead of a dot-matrix texture, it could give us an idea of how Vallesteros truly hears his music. It's tough to say whether it would augur a promising new direction or make him sound completely generic: My guess is that it would end up something like the first <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4047-the-stills/"" target=""_blank"">Stills</a> album, and that's not a bad thing.</p>
<p>And I guess the issue at hand is that if you're invested in Craft Spells' arc, it'd be nice to at least have an idea rather than a wild guess. <i>Gallery </i>is six Craft Spells songs that range from good to pretty good, which theoretically should make it a welcome addition. But so many of Vallesteros' predecessors-- <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4760-the-radio-dept/"" target=""_blank"">the Radio Dept.</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/324-belle-and-sebastian/"" target=""_blank"">Belle and Sebastian</a>, even more recent peers like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28353-wild-nothing/"" target=""_blank"">Wild Nothing</a>-- reward fans by using EPs as chances to work without a net, and the results can often outstrip those of their actual albums. Hopefully, <i>Gallery </i>is the closure of this particular moment and Vallesteros is inspired to see what comes after. </p></div>"|16591.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16591-craft-spells-gallery-ep/|6.2|Ian Cohen

I guess I wouldn't blame them if they did, because while both records cull from the same improvised studio session, only the first was edited and assembled by the pair themselves. <i>Versions</i> was crafted by McCombs' former <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4267-tortoise/"">Tortoise</a> bandmate Ken (aka ""Bundy K."") Brown, who got to choose whatever he liked from the seven hours of source material. So perhaps the increased strength is as much due to his vision as that of Daniell and McCombs.</p>
<p>Still, the pair's well-meshed guitars are what stand out, just as they did on <i>Sycamore</i>, which was quite good in its own right<i>.</i> The difference is that Brown's selections are spacious and open, resulting in a more expansive listening experience. His 45-minute mix has the feel of an IMAX nature doc-- each track slowly spreads out like the sun filling a horizon. Along the way, the duo attempts many modes-- simple loops, sparse melodies, droning ambience, loose jamming-- with equal success. And throughout all that variety (made more complex by the contributions of four different drummers), they stay remarkably consistent, never over-stretching or forcing anything.</p>
<p>The coherence is most evident in the atmosphere Daniell and McCombs create. Every track exudes a serenity that's unusually compelling. It can envelop you in the way that standing at the base of a skyscraper and looking skyward can overwhelm. So whether the pair is sparring with Chad Taylor in the first half of ""Burn After Reading"" (which evokes similar bouts between <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29387-gunn-truscinski-duo/"">Steve Gunn and John Truscinski</a>), layering drones over Steven Hess in ""Rialto"", or rumbling up a beat-less storm cloud in ""30265"", calm prevails. And it crests on the ""Ley Lines"", a Krautrock-leaning jam with Tortoise drummer John Herndon. Especially notable there is the restraint Daniell and McCombs employ. Either one could drown the track in chords or sustained tones, but instead they stick hypnotically to small notes and fractured loops.</p>
<p>There was clearly alchemy happening in that original Daniell-McCombs session, but the pair didn't stop there. <i>Versions </i>comes with a second LP comprising a couple of live tracks recorded in 2010. Here, the two musicians sound even more interested in crafting huge, widescreen crescendos. On Side A (taken from a concert in Knoxville, TN), slow, reflective chords and a pounding beat evoke <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4699-yo-la-tengo/"">Yo La Tengo</a> covering <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1420-earth/"">Earth</a>; on the flip (from a show in Montreal), near-silence builds to near-deafening density. Count these as two more novel approaches from a project that likely has many more sounds and angles up its sleeves.</p></div>"|16596.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16596-versions/|7.7|Marc Masters

In <a href=""http://offofficial.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">OFF!</a>-- the 56-year-old <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/"" target=""_blank"">Black Flag</a>/<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6183-circle-jerks/"" target=""_blank"">Circle Jerks</a> founder's latest soapbox-- he's finally found the three guys every bit as pissed off as he is. And the world's taken notice. It's been at least a year since Anthony ""Scatman"" Kiedis has left the house without conspicuously donning his cred-grabbing OFF! cap, and even nerds like us couldn't deny the blunt-force fury of OFF!'s masterful <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14919-first-four-eps/"" target=""_blank""><i>First Four EPs</i></a>. I doubt very much Keith and company are getting rich off this stuff, nor do I suspect they'd care if they were, but for the first time in a long time, Keith's fronting a band people give a shit about. Even a world-class curmudgeon like Keith Morris has to feel at least a little vindicated by that.</p>
<p>But that kind of hard-earned vindication too often leads to complacence, the very thing OFF! set out to smash on those <i>First Four EPs.</i> The band's mighty, metallic hardcore assault has showed no signs of slowing down in the two years since the EPs, and Morris, somewhat miraculously, still seems every bit the bile-spewing burnout at the heart of Black Flag's almost 35-year-old <i>Nervous Breakdown </i>EP and those early, gnarly Circle Jerks records. When, on <i>First Four EPs</i> highlight ""Upside Down"", Morris sneered, ""wonder why I'm always screaming?"" there was no real need to provide an answer; the stuck pig that was the last decade of the Circle Jerks had finally, mercifully bled out, the economy had gone from bad to worse, and besides, he's Keith Morris, and screaming's just what Keith Morrises do. <i>OFF!</i>-- their long-playing debut, coming in just shy of the <i>EPs</i>' runtime-- once again finds Morris venting spleen at anything and everything, but this time out, his targets seem softer and just a little harder to pin down. The thrill of hearing one of the world's great complainers in full-on kvetch mode is far from gone on <i>OFF!</i> But the ""holy SHIT"" surprise of those <i>First Four EPs</i> is somewhat dulled by the nagging feeling that we've heard a lot of this before.</p>
<p>True, those EPs didn't so much redraw hardcore's lines as bluntly retrace them. But they're as much Keith's to retrace as anybody's, and after so many years of middling Morris music, retapping that vast reservoir of rage for a quarter-hour was more than enough. And any accusations of mere regression were bulldozed by the fracas Morris' fellow lifers Dimitri Coats, Mario Rubalcaba, and Steven McDonald unloaded underneath him. Not that this music's ever especially easy, but the easiest thing these guys could've done to follow up the EPs was repeat themselves. But where those startling EPs seemed to recapture something vital from 1983, <i>OFF!</i>'s breathless pace and Morris' lyrical bloodletting can't help but sound a lot like 2010.</p>
<p><i>OFF!</i> runs a little dirtier than the EPs, every instrument-- particularly Coats' skin-grafting guitar-- closer in the mix and scuffed-up just so. Coats manages to slip a doomy intro or a little half-measure solo into a few of these songs, but that alone represents <i>OFF!</i>'s biggest progression from the EPs. Drummer Rubalcaba and bassist McDonald are left with little choice but to floor it; that's a task they're more than up for, but creatively, this still seems to be Coats' and Morris' show, with the rhythm section largely just along for the ride. (Could be why McDonald's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3549-redd-kross/"" target=""_blank"">Redd Kross</a> are making their first LP in years.) There's only so many ways you can reconfigure the same four pieces in 90-second bursts at this speed without repeating yourself, so when ""Borrow and Bomb"" comes on pretty much exactly like the EPs' ""Killing Away"", it's hard to know how upset to get about it. It's almost too easy to critique any hardcore band for their musical conservatism, but the mere existence of those EPs-- from those guys, in this decade-- was itself enough of a surprise to make that line of critique seem especially beside the point. Obstinence is everything to a band like <i>OFF!</i>, and ""more of the same,"" in this case, barely brings their total discography past the 30-minute mark. Even still, it's surprising how little they've moved the needle the second time around.</p>
<p>Most of the praise thrown at the EPs centered around Morris' voice, which recaptured some essential quality that seemed lost in too many years of disinterested flailing with the Jerks. Ironically enough, it's the unchanging nature of Morris' voice that proves <i>OFF!</i>'s biggest sticking point. Like the music, Keith's still long on rage, but short on progression, and that maniacal scream-stutter still takes its hard turns in much the same fashion as it did a couple of years back. As with Rubalcaba and McDonald, it's easy to chalk it up to a space issue-- the breakneck pace doesn't leave him with much time to goof around-- but the startling novelty of Unfrozen Caveman Morris has all but vanished, and without the shock of rediscovering something long considered lost, you're mostly left with a lot of vitriol to sort through. When, on ""I've Got News For You"", Keith calls out somebody who never ""trudged through sweat and piss"" the way Morris and co. have, his meaning's clear enough, but the target's a little harder to nail down. Is he raging at critics? His old bandmates? Fucking Green Day? Only Keith knows for sure. And the direct blows he does land-- whether they're against government control or pot-smoking buttheads who didn't dig <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/musicvideos/879-black-thoughts/"" target=""_blank"">""Black Thoughts""</a>-- fix themselves on fairly easy targets. Clarity, in this case, doesn't always suit him; when, on <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13511-cracked/"" target=""_blank"">""Cracked""</a>, Keith lays into <i>OFF!</i> naysayers for their ""hardcore karaoke retirement home""-style dismissals, the line's smirking self-awareness seems pettier with each pass. With little ambiguity in this music, what's left to the imagination on the mysterious murder-or-suicide at the heart of ""Harbor Freeway Blues"" and just what's inside the ""Toxic Box"" ups their replay value considerably. Mostly, Morris is at his best when channeling that fury into powder-nosed paranoiac travelogues, like the lurid liquor run of ""Man From Nowhere"", or ""Jet Black Girls"", which finds him in a warehouse, shouting out Darby Crash with a sixer down his pants. As ever, Morris' nihilism takes all comers, but <i>OFF!</i> still seems more of a strap-yourself-in-and-prepare-to-get-yelled-at proposition than the pointed, often self-directed rage of the EPs.</p>
<p>Still, while <i>OFF!</i> may not have the shock of the new (or, at least, the revitalized) on its side, it still gets in, gets angry, and gets moving in a skull-crackingly satisfying fashion. A guy like Morris could make yowling about tort reform gripping, particularly with the paint-stripping power of Coats, Rubacala, and McDonald backing him up, and even his less-focused gnashing still leaves its share of welts. Shouting ""feelings are meant to be hurt!"" along with Morris will never be anything less than a perverse pleasure, never mind what he says (or doesn't say) in between. And, the glorious failure of the Santorum campaign notwithstanding, things are every bit as mortifying out there as we roll into the summer of 2012 as they were a couple of winters back.

During the course of the tune, which changes every time they play it, they equate weed with most every sacred religious symbol, take solos that stretch for minutes, and sing in some malevolent half-chant incantation. They won't allow it to be edited for radio play, and they don't want to break it into tracks. And, by the way, the label footing the bill is the same 50-year-old institution that released music by the Rolling Stones, Ray Charles and, the Moody Blues: With every year that passes, both the tale and the tape of <i>Dopesmoker</i> seem a little more ridiculous. </p>
<p>The third album by a trio of 20-something San Jose, Calif., burnouts called Sleep, <i>Dopesmoker</i> resulted from a major-label skirmish over a band that had made two very good but not altogether great LPs of distorted, bluesy, and bleary-eyed rock. But those records-- 1991's <i>Volume One</i> and 1993's <i>Holy Mountain</i>-- sported would-be singles, editable jams like ""Holy Mountain"", ""Snowblind"", and ""The Wall of Yawn"" that might have found a home on the radio dial in the filthy backwash of grunge. In the battle between Elektra and London Records, however, Sleep didn't seem so interested in who might pay the most to get their stoner rock on the air; as guitarist Matt Pike, bassist Al Cisneros, and drummer Chris Hakius have said since, they wanted to go with the label that would pay for the album <i>and</i> mostly leave the music alone. London ostensibly signed off on such creative control. So after more than a year of legal wrangling to slip out of an old label contract, Sleep finally went with London and, in 1996, entered Record Two, the aforementioned well-equipped Northern California studio, with producer Billy Anderson and, as the fable goes, a lot of weed. </p>
<p>Their plan was to record the one-song album they'd been writing and testing live for at least four years. <a href=""http://www.decibelmagazine.com/hall-of-fame/sleep/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">As Cisneros told <i>Decibel</i> writer J. Bennett a decade later</a>, London had approved the idea, but the deep pockets began to get concerned as soon as they started to hear the music. Despite London's anxiety, technical troubles, and interpersonal tensions, Sleep finally finished the track in two month-long sessions. The label would never release it: After a series of contentious remixes and edits by a number of different hands hired by London, the imprint eked out a few cheap promos before deciding to can Sleep. The band broke up (in retrospect, they've said, they were headed this way with or without London), and during the next decade, three labels issued unofficial bootlegs or unagreeable edits of <i>Dopesmoker</i>, or as the band later called it, <i>Jerusalem</i>. </p>
<p>Now, 16 years after it was recorded, Sleep's storied third and easily best album is finally available through a remastered, re-illustrated reissue. Loud and more lucid, Southern Lord's greenest version of <i>Dopesmoker</i> pushes the record's highs to higher places and gives the whole hour just a bit more power. The trio has long complained that the previous versions didn't understand their intended aesthetic-- the art, the mixing, any of it. But a brilliant new cover by artist Arik Roper, who also designed the previously popular Tee-Pee version of the disc, pictures the ""Weedians"" of which Cisernos sings, making their pilgrimage to Nazareth, endless bongs strapped to their backs, an extra-terrestrial landscape in the distance. As Pike <a href=""http://thequietus.com/articles/08660-matt-pike-high-on-fire-interview"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">exclaimed to The Quietus</a> earlier this year, ""This one is going to look so fucking cool, it's so rad."" That statement should rightly apply not only to the cover but also to this entire reissue, which at long lasts fulfills the red-eyed vision of the people who made <i>Dopesmoker</i> while confirming the record's legacy both as a stoner-metal and psychedelic-rock masterpiece. This is one of the great major-label casualties, finally available in proper form.</p>
<p>When Sleep broke up after the failure of <i>Dopesmoker</i>, the trio split into two unequal halves: Almost immediately, Matt Pike started <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1943-high-on-fire/"" target=""_blank"">High on Fire</a>, who have continued adding different kinds of fuel to the same generalized burn. Years later, Hakius and Cisneros would return as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3222-om/"" target=""_blank"">Om</a> to explore the same iterative modalities that made listening to <i>Dopesmoker</i> feel like an instant inhalation. <i>Dopesmoker</i> is the perfect culmination before the collapse; Pike's bombast meet Om's repetition, a friction that rendered ideal sparks. Though the lengths of his solos are anything but modest, his playing itself is largely textural; when he steps into the spotlight, Pike lets repeated notes follow each other into a kaleidoscopic flurry. The persona of the shirtless, shouting dude at the helm of High on Fire remained in check, so as not to distract from the music's naturally meditative state. </p>
<p>To that end, Hakius and Cisneros weren't quite locked into Om's repetition addiction yet, either. Instead, they pushed against each other, Cisneros countering Pike's lumbering riffs with ample burl and perfectly sculpted tone. Historically, Hakius has criticized his own playing during the <i>Dopesmoker</i> sessions. But <i>Dopesmoker</i> is an infinitely explorable listen, the kind of record that will goad your attention through miniscule rabbit holes whether or not you're as stoned as the people who made it. Hakius' pulse is the constant carrot, then, filling the spaces when the band aggresses, forcing them forward when they pull back. He is a reminder to continue toward Nazareth.</p>
<p>And that's perhaps what remains most impressive about <i>Dopesmoker</i>, especially hearing it again for the first time through yet another reissue: It's an hour of adventure and momentum, where the lumber and the repetition somehow always push ahead. At a moment when black metal reinventers and D-beat revivers seem to dominate large sections of the heavy music world, maybe the thought of a resin-voiced singer intoning for an hour over riffs that wrap into themselves and drums that aim ever for infinity seems boring. But no matter how many times they had to record or rehearse ""Dopesmoker"" to master it, or no matter how much pressure London placed on them to make something more commercial than personal, Sleep sound as if their very existence depends upon the successful exercise of this weed ritual. In a sense, it's safe to say it did. This record's influence on substance, style, and simple ambition within heavy metal has long outlived the band that made it. </p>
<p>Southern Lord's reissue comes with no elaborate set of liner notes or verbose essay concerning the serpentine origin of the release itself. Rather, the tracklist is simply offered on the back cover, as well as the written-and-performed-by bona fides and the production credits. The insert consists entirely of a triptych of Pike, Hakius, and Cisneros performing and a photo of a massive piece of cardboard itemizing the contents of the titanic tune: ""Hot Lava Man 4x All Slow (Vocals)"", it reads in one spot. The only bonus is a fidelity-compromised live take of ""Holy Mountain"". It might be tempting to attribute this lack of archival scholarship to stoner lassitude, or to wish for the official story to serve as a sort of reverse score for the long-evasive music. But the story of <i>Dopesmoker</i> and the dissolution of Sleep have been passed around enough-- written about in books, discussed in interviews, warped and exaggerated by years of bong-ripping bros sharing the record with a friend for the first time. This reissue of <i>Dopesmoker</i> doesn't waste time with an introduction that this record no longer requires.</p></div>"|16601.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16601-dopesmoker/|8.5|Grayson Currin

His last two albums with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27538-here-we-go-magic/"" target=""_blank"">Here We Go Magic</a> (2009's<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12724-here-we-go-magic/"" target=""_blank""> self-titled</a> and 2010's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14318-pigeons/"" target=""_blank""><i>Pigeons</i></a>) sounded like the work of musicians who not only weren't sure who they wanted to be, but who could entertain the possibility of being several different things from song-to-song-- a liberal mindset maybe more admirable in a friend than an artist. It's not surprising that the best thing the band has put out yet-- a twitchy krautrock song called <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11852-collector/"" target=""_blank"">""Collector""</a>-- outlined Temple's fascination with people capable of fixating on a single thing, and even then, he confessed that his fascination was ""mild."" </p>
<p><i>A Different Ship</i>, the band's third album, makes a go of turning the anxiety of non-commitment into its own kind of commitment. One song is called ""How Do I Know""; another is called ""Make Up Your Mind"". The first line Temple sings is, ""It's hard sometimes to be close,"" and throughout, he makes an effort to keep his distance. He hums, he floats, he glides politely over the mix. The band splits its time between airy ballads and dry, hypercaffeinated stuff built from layers of interwoven guitars and synths-- music that creates a revisionist history of the 1980s where tightly-wound bands like the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5948-the-feelies/"" target=""_blank"">Feelies</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7758-devo/"" target=""_blank"">Devo</a> cohabitate with yacht rock. The title track alone may herald some kind of subterranean <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/7100-sting/"" target=""_blank"">Sting</a> renaissance.</p>
<p>It's an impeccably polished and careful record. But like a shirt buttoned all the way up to the neck, sophistication can wear a guy out. Whatever rough edges the band naturally cultivated on their first two albums have been neatly shaved off and sanded down with the help of producer Nigel Godrich, who makes everything sound vacuum-packed and expensive. Thinking about Godrich inevitably makes me think about <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3512-radiohead/"" target=""_blank"">Radiohead</a>. The creeping irony of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onRk0sjSgFU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Everything in Its Right Place""</a> is that it sounded like something, somewhere, was desperately wrong. The paradox here is that the band pretends at anxiety in a way that seems perfectly comfortable. It's George Clooney playing Woody Allen.</p>
<p>  Twice on the album, Temple admits to ""believing"" in things: One is ""action""; the other is Mary, whom he likes in part for her ""calm delivery."" I get the feeling he's aware of the music's even-handed character, which is as present in its sound as in his writing. And while there are moments when it comes together beautifully, like the way the carefree coda and rippling synthesizers on ""How Do I Know"" defy the song's rigid rhythms, a lot of this stuff feels strangely medicated. In melancholy hours it has inspired visions of bombs with their wicks dipped in water, or car commercials where good-looking creative professionals pull absently into suburban driveways.   </p>
<p>I think of this old line about how staying in the middle of the road is the best way to get run over. That's not entirely true. <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5471-bon-iver/"" target=""_blank"">Bon Iver</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a> practically live there, and they're doing fine. But it's strange to hear music so alternately mellow and obsessively ornamented. At least we can guess that Temple's worries may be winding down. </p></div>"|16556.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16556-here-we-go-magic-a-different-ship/|6.3|Mike Powell

Given that a couple of their earliest releases came out on <a href=""http://www.prankrecords.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Prank</a>, it's natural a little punk would shine through the murk. Through a pair of tapes released in 2010 and 2011, and packaged together as <i>Interminable Night</i>, the death-metal influence became more prevalent. D-beats were still a component of the band's machinery, but the riffing began to resemble Grave and other stalwarts of 1990s Swedish death metal. On <i>Deathless Master</i>, the crust presence has all but departed, and Acephalix are now committed to death metal. In metal, consistency is more desirable than diversity-- bands are at their most potent when they record albums where the sound is uniform and where the atmosphere is established. There's always the occasional <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3111-naked-city/"" target=""_blank"">Naked City</a>, but Acephalix know they are not Naked City. They know that finding your strength and focusing on that will reap artistic dividends, which is exactly what <i>Deathless</i> does.</p>
<p>Spiritually, the quartet-- which shares three members with the newer group <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/30078-vastum/"" target=""_blank"">Vastum</a>-- takes cues from the most ancient death metal band of them all, Master. When Paul Speckmann created Master in 1983, there was no ""death metal."" He took the thrash and heavy metal he loved, amplified the harsh aspects, and birthed the new genre. Acephalix display a similar appreciation for simplicity on <i>Deathless</i>-- they don't seek to fancify death metal, but to penetrate the soil deeper. Riffs are still of the Swedish persuasion, but Acephalix also work in grooves that they can call their own. Guitarist Kyle House has a knack for catchiness in a genre that seldom rewards such a trait; this is especially seen in ""On Wings..."", where he maintains a bounce even when the chord patterns and tempos shift. ""The Hunger"" serves the same function as the long closing title track from <i>Interminable</i>, but improves upon that template. House's introductory lead is off-kilter and angular; from there the band continues to vamp and pummel until the track fades out.</p>
<p>Acephalix's most noticeable transformation is with vocalist Daniel Butler. In the group's earlier days, he had a snarl that was kept high enough to fit the then-crusty sound. Out of all the members, he's embraced the shift in direction the most, delivering a guttural yell seemingly submerged in tar. His vocals add the ambiance a death-metal album needs-- that the band is overtaking you, that you are a slave to the inevitable. You have to wonder if he's had it in him this whole time, and he was just waiting for the right music to really let hell break out. Lesser bands will list their vocalist under ""Vokills"" in their liner notes as a contrived measure of brutality; Butler will simply use his gut to strangle you.</p>
<p>What's also interesting about <i>Deathless</i> is that, while it's an entirely different organism from the rest of the band's works, like them, it was recorded at San Francisco's Lennon Studios with <span class=""Description PromoDetailsItem"">Vöetsek's </span>Jef Leppard. He's in tune with the band's changes, and dials in appropriately thick tones. It's nice to see that a band can organically develop its sound while still maintaining a home-grown sensibility. Should the relationship continue, how else will Acephalix mutate in the future? Sometimes, even the music most focused on darkness can inspire a burst of optimism.</p></div>"|16551.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16551-deathless-master/|7.5|Andy O'Connor

Guitar hooks crackle and shimmer, rather than just crackle.</p>
<p>But for those who prefer Presley's paisley-tinted jangling with a hint of static, there's plenty to go around on <i>Family Perfume</i>. Whittled down from an alleged cache of 80 songs, <i>Family Perfume </i>gathers Presley's favorite efforts from a year spent crouched over a 4-track recorder. Sometimes that means gentle hooks.

But White Fence is his most consistent project to date. Working sans bandmates, he's evolved an eerie and elastic take on the melodies of baby boomer teen-hood; sampling <i>Nuggets-</i>era drum breaks and looping them to form the foundation for skewed guitar pop that isn't shy about cribbing some chord progressions from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2304-the-kinks/"" target=""_blank"">Kinks</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22337-buffalo-springfield/"" target=""_blank"">Buffalo Springfield</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3319-pink-floyd/"" target=""_blank"">Pink Floyd</a>.

His third proper album, <i>Family Perfume</i>,<i> </i>doubles down on those zonked out inclinations.</p>
<p><i>Vol. 1</i>, which arrived in early April,<i> </i>is the most consistent of the pair. The melodies bend and warble, but generally cohere into recognizable structures. ""Swagger Vets &amp; Double Moon"" takes an in-the-red stab at glam rock. ""Do You Know Ida Know?"" augments a marching beat with eerily pitch-shifted backing vocals. Meanwhile, Presley drops couplets that sound like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1131-donovan/"" target=""_blank"">Donovan</a> trying to recap the plot of <i>Repo Man</i>. The 1960s may inform the riffs, but White Fence's lyrics aren't the stuff of nostalgia. At least, not for the summer of love. Presley's splintered narratives and word salads mostly call to mind his former bandmate, Mark E. Smith: <span>""A Detroit factory so black and melted/ Stands a better chance than the farmers' pollen/ In a field of grey concrete and you know it will never be,"" sings Presley on the surrealist break-up ballad, ""It Will Never Be"".</span></p>
<p>From there, it just gets weirder. <i>Vol. 2 </i>dive-bombs deeper into the zonked-out ephemera, letting the outré tape noises and sound effects hold center stage. The retro-rock reference point makes a noticeable slip from West Coast hippie fare toward the rubbery harmonies of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/298-syd-barrett/"" target=""_blank"">Syd Barrett</a>-era Pink Floyd. Presley embraces the technical foibles of his recording gear-- stopping and starting takes to create confusing blends between songs.

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;""><span style=""mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt;"">And sometimes, he just speaks his mind.

Give or take <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/22484-rustie/"" target=""_blank"">Rustie</a>, he may be the best dance producer to make a name in the last five years, period. And <i>Galaxy Garden</i>, the fifth Lone album since 2007, is a wonder, his most complete statement yet, both a refinement and an expansion of the genre-of-one he's been perfecting over the last few years.</p>
<p>Each track on <i>Galaxy Garden </i>is a four- or five-minute maximalist marvel in minimalist disguise. Always direct and propulsive, as if racing forward without the time to stop and admire their own brilliant detail work, Lone tracks still manage to juggle three or six or 10 layers of rhythm with disarming skill. One beat alone may be constructed from footwork-like kick barrages, clattering retro drum machines, wild hand percussion loops, and chimes and bells that accent the already intricate groove science.</p>
<p>Even at his ""simplest,"" like the clank-clonk of ""Cthulhu"", which echoes the spare programming of late drum and bass, Cutler swirls all sorts of glittering rhythm baubles around the main beat. Because why risk boredom when you can go all-out? Like the best young dance producers of the moment, happily embracing abundance after years of miserly dance minimalism, Cutler's attitude seems to be that more is always better, provided it doesn't fuck up the groove.</p>
<p>And then there's the magic Cutler works on top of those grooves, a spell of simple heart-tugging melodies, show-off instrumental virtuosity, and pure sound effect pyrotechnics. As if constructing such head-wrecking beats was no big deal, he then attempts to throw in everything else he can, whether it's warm Detroit synth washes, plangent guitar licks, prog-like keyboard runs, hardcore synth stabs that trigger both nostalgia and an adrenalin rush, or all of them at once. ""The Animal Pattern"" is anchored by a silly bouncing ball of a keyboard pattern, guaranteed to produce grins. It's a good enough hook to carry someone else's whole track, but that doesn't stop Cutler from including spasms of acid house, delicate Kraftwerk-like runs, and whooshes like cartoon spacecraft taking off.</p>
<p>What's amazing is that, despite their density, Lone tracks never splutter out into headache-inducing clutter. I'm guessing that's because Cutler has fixed on certain operating principles of old-school rave as much as the sound itself. He understands the way the best rave producers managed to combine so many paradoxical ideas about form and intent into single tracks.</p>
<p>So, sure, Cutler can expertly echo certain precise moments from rave's past, intentionally or not, like the way ""As a Child"" recalls both the tape-warp wooziness of Bodysnatch's ""Secret Summer Fantasy"" and the idyllic guitar loop of DJ Die's ""Autumn"". But those are two reference points you're hardly required to know in order to enjoy the track, maybe two reference points Cutler didn't even have in mind. Because forget historical fidelity for a minute: What really links <i>Galaxy Garden</i> to that early-1990s golden age is the way it manages to be both manic and chill, overstuffed with ideas and viscerally direct, relentlessly uplifting and never drippy about it.</p>
<p>Most millennial neo-ravers were barely eating solid food when acts like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3170-orbital/"" target=""_blank"">Orbital</a> were cutting their first ecstatic singles. As Simon Reynolds noted in his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/8721-maximal-nation/"" target=""_blank"">""Maximal Nation"" essay</a>, they'd come of age with the starkness of dance-punk, the gloom of early dubstep, the grimness of ""serious"" European techno. So maybe this youthful revolt-- rediscovering the neon surfaces, speedy beats, and throw-in-as-many-hooks-as-you-can pop thrills of late-1980s and early-90s dance music-- wasn't so surprising. Kids gotta go against the dominant culture, after all. And after a decade spent exploring thousand shades of darkness, this overturning of values was wonderful, like waking up one day to sunshine after a week of shitty weather.</p>
<p>But once you got over the surprise, that this music had not been stricken from dance history after all, it was hard not to hear something dry and academic and forced in a lot of the new stuff. There was a certain irony there, given that early rave was all about vitality and immediacy, as if this wave of rave reverence had drained the sound of some essence. There was also the nagging question of whether these neo-rave records offered anything <i>new</i>, any 21st-century twists to make them stand out from the records they paid tribute to.</p>
<p>Cutler is in his late 20s, not really a kid anymore, and so he probably has vague memories of this music playing itself out in real time. But anyone can easily download the whole of rave history now, become a scholar without having been there at all. Part of what makes <i>Galaxy Garden </i>unique, in a scene that's quickly become glutted, is its simultaneous sensitivity to particular old-school sonics and an interest in everything that's come after.</p>
<p>Mostly this now-ness surfaces in the rhythms. There are groove ideas here that never would have occurred to a producer in 1991, either because the technology wasn't quite there yet or beats had yet to be twisted in those particular ways. Which is a little funny, because for his first few doggedly downtempo albums, melody was Lone's strong suit, not rhythm. And yet, after a few years making excellent if not particularly noteworthy homages to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/410-boards-of-canada/"" target=""_blank"">Boards of Canada</a>, something in Cutler's music opened up once he rediscovered that early rave and techno really moved him. This is not the way things usually go with retro-minded artists, who are often so obsessed with mimicking each period detail of their heroes' work that the results wind up sounding pinched and inhibited. By focusing on the music he loved, however old it was, and keeping tabs on the present, Cutler could become more himself.</p>
<p>I'm usually wary of making the kind sweeping pronouncements about an artist's value found in that first paragraph, but in Lone's case, uncomplicated enthusiasm seems like the appropriate response. Lone's music is obviously complex, especially once you get past the overwhelming brightness of its outer layers and the rush of the tempo. But like the music made by his rave and techno heroes, <i>Galaxy Garden</i> is celebratory stuff. Mostly it seems to be celebrating the simple luck of being alive, of getting to make music designed to bring people together rather than bum them out.</p></div>"|16578.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16578-galaxy-garden/|8.2|Jess Harvell

By the mid-1980s, innovators like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6180-black-flag/"" target=""_blank"">Black Flag</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45573-die-kreuzen-reunite/"" target=""_blank"">Die Kreuzen</a> had outgrown the style's nasty, brutish, and short imperative and were looking ahead to something wider and more resonant. The result was what's often called post-hardcore, a fragmented movement that dominated American underground rock from the late 80s through the 90s. This is where your <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1584-fugazi/"" target=""_blank"">Fugazis</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/5860-slint/"" target=""_blank"">Slints</a> come in, bands that made a clear break with the first wave's unfiltered vitriol, but held on to its core mission: Be yourself, and don't worry about whether anyone else gets it.</p>
<p>There are all kinds of transitional documents, mid-80s works by bands like Ian MacKaye's Embrace, Glenn Danzig's Samhain, and Daniel Higgs' Reptile House, that map out the shadowy middle ground between these two territories. But there are few clearer illustrations of how hardcore birthed its ""post-"" than the <a href=""http://mossicon.us/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Moss Icon</a> discography, reissued here in a spare yet elegant package (heavy on artwork and light on annotation) in time for the band's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45610-moss-icon-reunite-for-live-shows/"" target=""_blank"">upcoming reunion</a>.</p>
<p>Moss Icon sprung from no well-known scene. Originating in 1986 in Annapolis, Maryland, about an hour east of D.C., they played shows in the capital but didn't make records for Dischord, and that's a key distinction-- one reason why mentions of bands like Lungfish and Hoover still meet with nods of recognition while Moss Icon might elicit a quizzical shrug. You'll hear some of what would later come to be known as the Louisville sound in Moss Icon, the weird precociousness and insularity that marks Squirrel Bait and Slint, as well as later exponents like Rodan. But in a way, Moss Icon were even further out there. If <i>Spiderland</i> is a controlled masterpiece, Moss Icon's definitive statement, <i>Lyburnum Wit's End Liberation Fly</i>, which was recorded in 1988 but not issued until 1994, and which leads off <i>Complete Discography</i>, is a feral one, still fueled by a seething adolescent heart. Here and in their later work, the band extends and abstracts hardcore forms until they sound more like rituals than punk songs. There's a strong political message to Moss Icon's work as well-- a sweeping indictment of American inhumanity, from the Trail of Tears to modern warfare-- but it doesn't come packaged in catchy slogans you can pump your fist to. This is modernistic punk, matching fury with obliqueness; it whispers so you have to lean in close, and then screams your ear off.</p>
<p>At the center of it all is frontman Jonathan Vance. One minute he might remind you of a D.C. hardcore shouter, an angry young man hollering himself hoarse; the next, he's muttering cryptic poetry in an archaic tongue. In the <i>Complete Discography</i> booklet, there's a photo of Vance kneeling on a stage, grimacing and clutching his head, as though the demons won't leave him alone. His performances harness the same energy; they sound like exorcisms. Hardcore had seen would-be poet types before, but Vance was the real deal, more Rimbaud than Rollins.</p>
<p><i>Lyburnum</i> demonstrates how effective Vance can be when combined with his bandmates' minimalist art-punk savvy. ""I'm Back Sleeping, or Fucking, or Something"" sums up in three minutes everything that makes Moss Icon great. Bassist Monica DiGialleonardo sets up a gothy bass vamp, and drummer Mark Laurence adds sparse punctuation. Vance stumbles in, sounding like a sleeptalker, worrying over weird phrases: ""Your gardens and bridges green/ With shit came running."" Suddenly, Laurence and guitarist Tonie Joy lock in like a vise around DiGialleonardo's riff, and Vance unleashes his full-throated scream. There's little more to the song than this repeated slack-to-tense progression, with the quiet sections growing ever noisier and more unhinged. But the band owns its minimal materials completely, embracing chaos while breathing in unison like a set of lungs.</p>
<p>There's a similar alchemy at work on ""Lyburnum-Wit's End (Liberation Fly)"", which steadily accrues weight over 11 sprawling minutes. Slint would attempt something similar a few years later with the exquisite ""Good Morning, Captain"", but Moss Icon's vision of an epic is shaggier and more earthy. Vance unspools a fractured narrative as the band trances out on a series of riffs-- one ploddy, another sparkly and uplifting-- working its way toward a distant climax. This is not, strictly speaking, eventful music, but however meandering it can seem from moment to moment (it wouldn't be too far-fetched to describe this and several later <i>Complete Discography</i> tracks as jams), it always feels purposeful. The rest of <i>Lyburnum</i> covers a lot of ground-- psychedelic postpunk (""Cricketty Rise""), a borderline metallic diatribe (""Mirror""), a grave anti-patriotic elegy with some of Vance's most evocative lyrics on record (""Happy"")-- always maintaining the same level of urgency. It's clear that these are songs that had to come out.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Complete Discography</i> (disc two of the CD version) features a grab bag of sessions from before, after, and even during the <i>Lyburnum</i> recordings. The context is crucial, as we get to hear what Moss Icon sounded like when they stood on either side of the hardcore and ""post-"" divide. One of the strongest tracks here is ""Gravity"", sourced from a 1991 split release, and featuring additional guitarist Alex Badertscher. Almost more than Slint's own work, the song prefigures the post-<i>Spiderland</i> continuum with eerie exactitude: It's hard to hear Vance's opening monologue, accompanied by folkish clean-toned guitar, and not think of June of 44, Dianogah, and all the other bands who borrowed from the Louisville playbook. ""Gravity"" also illustrates why some have saddled Moss Icon with the proto-emo tag; the track details a refreshing moment of seaside repose, embodying a New Age-y spirituality that seems worlds away from the dire catharsis of conventional hardcore. ""We have living respiration/ A breath echo vibration/ Solid sun/ Inspiration,"" Vance declares in a tumbling blend of chant and speech, sounding like a man who's found his own version of God in nature. The musicians bolster him with rhythms that feel both driving and infinitely expandable; DiGialleonardo's free-range basslines, in particular, are songs unto themselves. </p>
<p>In contrast, the last three songs from disc two, first issued on a 1988 7"" that preceded <i>Lyburnum</i>, take a more elemental approach. These tracks are punk, pure and simple-- less speedy than, say, Minor Threat, but with the same sense of young DIY musicians grasping tight to the only thing that makes sense to them. ""I wish that I could see/ What's going bad with me,"" Vance shouts, as Joy and co. back him with needling, throbbing patterns. Here, as in the later material, the band uses passionate focus to convey how it feels to come unglued. (Joy's guitar solo, a series of variations on a simple postpunky lead, is a 15-second marvel that looks ahead to his more blatantly psychedelic work in the Convocation and current project Slow Bull.) If some of the tracks on disc two feel strained-- the heavy-handed antiwar piece ""Memorial"" and a remake of ""As Afterwards the Words Still Ring"" (heard in an earlier version on <i>Lyburnum</i>), where Vance flirts with preachiness as he describes an escaped slave fleeing from attack dogs-- they do little to diminish the enthralling mystique of <i>Complete Discography</i> as a whole. Moss Icon may have passed through an awkward developmental phase, but it's not in evidence here.</p>
<p>It's overhwelming to encounter this full body of work in one chunk. Moss Icon's output demands a full intellectual and emotional engagement, and rewards it completely; their songs leave you feeling you've just stumbled out of a sweat lodge, delirious but refreshed. So while <i>Complete Discography</i> clearly demonstrates how primitive American punk evolved into an anything-goes art music, that isn't why this release is a must-hear. It's essential because, like Fugazi, Slint, or any other wondrous butterfly nourished in hardcore's cocoon, Moss Icon were a band that forged their own universe-- high-minded yet also full of white-hot youth. Any label you could pin on them seems inadequate, and in the end, what more could you ask?</p></div>"|16586.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16586-complete-discography/|8.9|Hank Shteamer

Mascis sported what ex-Homestead and current Matador exec Gerard Cosloy called ""huge fuckin'... stick-your-finger-in-the-socket-type hair."" Oakey, meanwhile, claimed a jet-black half-mane that was nothing short of proto-Skrillex. Both did execute vocal styles that were at once melodic and patently bored, and Mascis and Oakey each served as centers of gravity for a certain kind of freak: Mascis attracted noiseniks and ex-hardcore kids, Oakey the shut-in New Romantics. But a hypothetical Venn Diagram would still find few intersecting characteristics of substance.</p>
<p><i>The Electronic Anthology Project of Dinosaur Jr.</i> is a creation of Mascis and Built to Spill bassist Brett Nelson that attempts to diminish the gap, with a collection of nine Dino Jr. synth-pop covers, culled mostly from the band's 1987 SST classic, <i>You're Living All Over Me</i>. Within 20 seconds it's evident that Mascis is kidding, as though he'd showed up to the party in an unlikely Halloween costume, and no one but his close friends and followers can truly understand the magnitude of its comedic value. </p>
<p>Much of the joke behind <i>Electronic Anthology Project </i>can be found in the tangible, philosophical clash that has always fallen between technical guitar rock and electronic pop. While Dinosaur used extended guitar heroics for melodic hybrids that mined 1970s classic rock sounds-- Stones, Sabbath, Creedence, Neil Young, Crazy Horse-- the early-1980s new wave groups like Depeche Mode and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark were attempting to ward off that tradition's egotism with glittering synthesizers. These groups saw electronic instruments as democratic, punk tools for everyman, playing down the conventional guitar-bass-drum format and the necessity of technique. All the while, Mascis was busy jamming complex guitar work and engaging with hardcore as a listener and participant, performing with Dinosaur Jr.'s Lou Barlow in the band Deep Wound until 1984.</p>
<p>Considering<i> Electronic Anthology Project</i> doesn't make use of a single guitar, it immediately drops much of what made Dinosaur a visionary alt-rock group to begin with. The band's defining characteristic has always been its excruciatingly loud execution, for which they were met early on with flying beer bottles and banned from clubs throughout their native Northampton, Mass. It's hard to imagine the clichéd mechanical drums and goofy, plastic synths on <i>EAP</i> building any kind of energy or fury. In 2001 Michael Azerrad wrote that the murk and mystique at play on <i>You're Living All Over Me</i> was ""like a pond one could never see the bottom of"" and so it never got old. But <i>EAP</i> is so surface-oriented it's good only for a few plays, albeit ones that are entirely essential for devoted Dinosaur fans.</p>
<p>The massive swath of noise that introduces the original ""Sludgefest"" here becomes a barrage of cosmic, anxious synths, glitching and whirling from all angles, like a game of laser tag. ""Got to connect with you, girl, before I forget how,"" Mascis pleads; stripped of distortion and rocketfire punk riffage it sounds like a Drake lyric. Indeed, these slick remakes do a fine job of highlighting the devastating emotion in Mascis' mumbled poetry, which now moves each track with newfound resonance. ""Raisans"" is lacking without its molten guitar eruptions or any attempt to compensate for their absence, but it's still a real heartbreaker: ""I'll be hanging where eventually you'll have to be/ I'll just stare and hope you'll care/ It's only everything standing in front of me."" </p>
<p>A number of the tracks on <i>Electronic Anthology Project</i> come from the loud/quiet back-and-forth convention that helped Dinosaur draw the map for 1990s alt rock: calm, percolating verses that offer a foil for soaring, melodic choruses. ""Pond Song"" off 1988's <i>Bug</i> reinterprets that dynamic for one of the collection's most entertaining tracks, as Mascis sings, with sunny, wide-eyed optimism, ""Pain is a wave, come on let's ride it."" Less extraordinary are ""The Lung"" and ""Kracked"", whose reimagined wah-wah noise just feels like generic video-game filler. Despite the comic relief, the instrumentals feel static.</p>
<p>Adding to the comedy here is that the record's three most successful tracks are simply tacked to the end: ""Tarpit"", ""Little Fury Things"", and ""Feel the Pain"". The most tasteful synth-pop keeps subtlety and restraint in mind, and those guiding principles help make ""Tarpit"" an enjoyable <i>EAP</i> creation, along with ""Feel the Pain"" from 1994's <i>Without a Sound</i>. ""Pain"" is the only track pulled from Dinosaur's major-label, post-Barlow days, and its subdued melancholy (""I feel the pain of everyone/ Then I feel nothing"") suggests that quieter approach could have made the whole of <i>EAP</i> more listenable. Keep this one for your mixtape repertoire.</p>
<p>Mascis is a guy with a strange, biting sense of humor that has always quietly shone through the cracks; you may recall that earlier this year he allowed his likeness to become <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/45173-j-mascis-the-bobblehead-doll/"" target=""_blank"">J Mascis: the Bobblehead Doll</a>.<i> </i>Like <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14584-the-electronic-anthology-project/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Electronic Anthology Project </i>of Built to Spill</a> before it, this record surely could have been improved with a bit more pragmatism, like a colder or more nuanced approach, because Mascis' drawl does suit synthetic sounds quite well. But <i>Electronic Anthology Project</i> is novelty that is more than earned, and if you're a Mascis devotee who can see the world in his warped way, you'll find a place for it.</p></div>"|16598.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16598-the-electronic-anthology-project-of-dinosaur-jr/|6.5|Jenn Pelly
