The contents in their cauldron: shadowy, reverb-smothered guitar rock-- something that's never been in short supply, sure, but that doesn't diminish how well-timed the band's debut LP, <i>Friends For Now</i>, feels. In case your issue of <i>Indie Rock Gossip</i> ended up in your neighbor's mailbox last month, the knotty Canadian indie rockers in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/26456-women/"" target=""_blank"">Women</a> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/40559-women-implode-onstage-cancel-tour/"" target=""_blank"">spectacularly dismantled</a> on stage at the tail end of 2010, leaving a potential void for similarly styled up-and-comers to take their place while the band works their shit out.</p>
<p>In a sense, Young Prisms are perfect placeholders; they seem to favor complexity and confusion above all else, and the notable moments of <i>Friends For Now</i> find the band utilizing those elements like able chemists. Not so fast, though: It seems the band forgot that while you're making music, it's a good idea to have some hooks. Instead, the record's leaden; as a straight-through listen, it plays like a monolith-- massive and somewhat uninteresting. Every once in a while, an enjoyable part of the record's whole emerges from the murk-- the menacing Sonic Youth-y guitar line that emerges in the middle of ""Feel Fine"", or the way that the submerged melody of ""In Your Room"" breathes like curtains near an open window. Otherwise, the fact that this 36-minute record plays like it's twice as long means that something went wrong here.</p>
<p>As with a lot of bands of late, their vocalists, Giovanni Betteo and Stefanie Hodapp, are dragging them down. Just the fact that you need a Google search to tell that more than one person sings in Young Prisms is the reddest of red flags. Their personality-bereft voices take on a chameleonic quality in which, when surrounded by the accompanying music, they eventually become nothing at all. It's possible that the lack of inspiring melodies is a reason why there's no passion in their performances-- alternately, as the maxim of ""Sugar"" states, ""I'm still high/ I'm still alive."" With those extremely modest goals checked off the list, it's unclear if Young Prisms care much about accomplishing much else for the time being.</p></div>"|15063.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15063-friends-for-now/|5.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

Songs of Love, Lust and Contempt From the 1920s and 1930s|0.0|Various Artists|[]|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Dust-to-Digital']|2011-02-04 00:00:00|2010|2016-06-11 17:34:40.715218|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".2abtbf79wjk.1.6:0.1.0.$15059/=1$15059.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>It seems odd to pair the 1920s and 30s together, as they could not be any more different, at least in the public consciousness. The 20s roared decadently, all Prohibition sneakiness, flapper fervor, and urbane jazz music. The 30s nursed the nation's wounds during the Great Depression, producing hobo itinerancy and angry labor songs. <i>Baby How Can It Be</i>?, compiled from the collection of John Heneghan (of Eden &amp; John's East River String Band), largely ignores history and geography, deriving its personality and power from the broadness of its organizing concepts-- which are really just excuses for making an engaging, exciting mixtape. Heneghan and co-producer Steven Lance Ledbetter uncover the lasciviousness lurking beneath the decades' remembered propriety, which means today the sexual code words in these songs are more unexpected and therefore more shocking than, say, the racial epithets.</p>
<p>And yet, musically <i>Baby How Can It Be</i> is so diverse and wide-ranging that these two decades come across as a period of intense innovation, perhaps the busiest time for popular music in America. To some extent, credit goes to Heneghan and Ledbetter, who see no difference between genres and geography. Instead, they treat rural and urban music, as well as black and white music, equally and let small-town blues pickers rub elbows with big-city jazz sophisticates. <i>Baby How Can It Be</i> plays as a travelogue: lingering in Louisiana to ogle some Creole chicks, assimilating on the reservation to win a chief's daughter, eyeballing the hula girls in Hawaii. Think Jay-Z's ""Girls Girls Girls"", except with banjos and hot horn sections.</p>
<p>The set gives each of the emotions in the subtitle-- Love, Lust, and Contempt-- its own separate disc, which winkingly implies a narrative trajectory beginning with getting it on and arcing toward getting over it. The Love songs typically hint at some impending disaster-- read: marriage-- while the Lust songs display a strong devotion, albeit one based on sex rather than romance. And Contempt is an especially intriguing word here, covering a range of attitudes from Robert Hill's ""You Gonna Look Like a Monkey When You Get Old"" to the Callahan Brothers' high-lonesome ""I Want to Ask the Stars"". Rather than being depressive, however, the compilation crackles with sly wit and lusty energy.</p>
<p>The musicians on <i>Baby How Can It Be</i> are innovators of innuendo, and anyone who thinks the first half of the 20th century was a period of propriety and repression will be blushing beet red even before hearing Harry Roy &amp; His Bat-Club Boys' 1931 romp ""Pussy"". There's an endless parade of double and sometimes single entendres throughout the collection, especially on the Lust disc: a memorable yo-yo, some wienies and buns, a pan of shortnin' bread, and Frankie ""Half-Pint"" Jaxon boasting on ""It's Heated"", ""I can keep your boiler hot 'til the superintendent comes!"" The lovin' sounds freer and funner than anything the 1960s had to offer.</p>
<p><i>Baby How Can It Be</i> proves just as spirited when the singers are down in the dumps. Laura Smith opens Disc Three with the gleefully depressive ""I'm Gonna Kill Myself"", in which she enumerates the many ways she plans to do it: ""I wanna die die die till I die."" These songs brim with playful humor even in the face of remorse and despair. Even when offering a lascivious wink, they're never being simply lewd, thanks to the producers' careful sequencing and to the artists' happy revelation that pop music can convey all their desires and frustrations. Or, as the unnamed female singer on ""Banjo"" Ikey Robinson and His Bull Fiddle Band's ""My Four Reasons"" so eloquently puts it, ""Everybody get filthy!""</p></div>"|15059.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15059-baby-how-can-it-be-songs-of-love-lust-and-contempt-from-the-1920s-and-1930s/|8.4|Stephen M.

Team</a>, let alone affixing it with an exclamation point for guaranteed bonus exuberance. Few bands have gone to such great lengths to forge a connection between their name and their sound. Since its inception, the group has reconstructed sounds that are all about inspiring motion-- cheerlander chants, rollerskate jams, breakdance beats, cop-show chase themes, 90s mosh-pit rock-- into a brass-blasted wall of squall. But the side effect of constant movement is fatigue-- in this case, on the band itself, which charged through its 2007 sophomore release<i> <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10649-proof-of-youth/"" target=""_blank"">Proof of Youth</a></i> with the same gusto<i> </i>heard on its dazzingly 2004 debut,Â <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3654-thunder-lightning-strike/"" target=""_blank"">Thunder, Lightning, Strike</a></i>. Compounding the exhaustion on <i>Proof of Youth</i> is Parton's unwavering deference for high-pitch-frequency productions that sound like they're blaring out of an old <a href=""http://www.amigalounge.com/uploaded_images/1974-Zenith-TV-765857.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zenith</a>, tenuously walking the line between ingratiating and just plain grating.</p>
<p>From the outset, <i>Rolling Blackouts </i>provides little relief: opener <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/#/musicvideo/10042-the-go-team-tornado-memphis-industries"" target=""_blank"">""T.O.R.N.A.D.O""</a> announces itself with all the subtlety of an air-raid siren, as lead MC Ninja wages a losing battle against a torrential blitzkrieg of horn breaks and scratch effects. The song essentially serves the same function as the opening themes to the 80s action shows Parton was raised on: it's the Go! Team advertising itself, an instant reacquainting device to remind you of what you're tuning into. But thankfully, Parton proves much more willing to change up the script. His cut-and-paste aesthetic is still very much in effect; he just uses it to assemble more varied and satisfying songs.</p>
<p>There's always been a latent appreciation of 60s girl-group pop buried beneath the Go! Team's hyper-funk ballast, and that quality is given more time and space to shine here, whether in the Motown-by-way-of-Tokyo sweep of ""Secretary Song"" or the ""Ready Steady Go!""-worthy ""Ready to Go Steady"". Most successful of all is the band's wonderful collaboration with Best Coast's Bethany Cosatino on the fuzz-pop delight ""Buy Nothing Day"". But even the typical jump-rope exercises (""Apollo Throwdown"", ""The Running Range"") are leavened by acoustic-based sonics and congenially melodic choruses. Meanwhile, Parton's sound world now absorbs everything from endearingly schmaltzy soap-opera soundtracks (""Yosemite Theme"") to Yo La Tengo-style dream-pop reveries (the title track). Of course, ""Back Like 8 Track"" closes the album by returning to the group's familiar schoolyard terrain. Hopefully, <i>Rolling Blackouts</i> marks the moment in the Go! Team's career where the idea of moving forward becomes less of a literal concept and more an artistic one.</p></div>"|15048.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15048-rolling-blackouts/|7.5|Stuart Berman

Young the Giant not only <i>sound </i>like these bands to a certain extent, but their self-titled debut fits this mold philosophically as well. In recent years indie rock has been increasingly appealing to commercial interests, yet it's hardly seemed to be growing out of an assembly line in the machine room of the Big Music Industry. But this is ""corporate indie."" You almost <i>hope</i> Young the Giant acquiesced to some music executives' request to compromise their style, because nothing else sufficiently explains a debut so devoid of personality.</p>
<p>A quintet of Persian, Indian, British, and French Canadian members descent hailing from Newport Beach, Calif., they're signed to Roadrunner Records, which is presumably still eating off the back catalogs of Slipknot and Nickelback. But their debut LP exists on a singular plane, in that it's pretty much indescribable. I don't mean in the sense that it has no artistic precedent-- think any form of rock that was called ""alternative"" despite being completely uninformed by punk, electronic music, or anything actually ""alternative."" Rather it seems the album's intent is to make no impression whatsoever on the listener: ambient music performed like rock, except nowhere near as interesting as that sounds in theory.</p>
<p>Vagueness pervades the album; politely distorted guitars twist and churn but never turn into riffs. Choruses become placeholders instead of hooks. Sameer Gadhia's vocals, often recalling Chris Martin's trembling midrange, deliver prosaic lyrics that are neither plainspoken enough to reveal simple truths nor evocative enough to scan as poetry-- there are passing references to general bummed-ness (""Apartment""), addiction (the rank Cold War Kids karaoke of ""My Body""), and prostitutes (the cutely named ""St. Walker""), but nothing specific enough to prevent them from also selling deodorant.</p>
<p>This sort of purposefully blank approach means that the few songs boasting any sort of frill stand out by default, whether it's the perfunctory slide guitar of ""St. Walker"" or the sleepwalking harmonies of ""I Got"". But just to hammer home the indistinctness of it all, after its relatively dry start, Young the Giant take a mid-album reverb bath and dial up the distant, delayed guitar leads and tentative tom beats, once again proving that U2 is still the most influential band of all time for those artists who can't think of other ways to conjure atmosphere.</p>
<p>Remember when Candlebox was described by Madonna as ""our grunge band"" after they signed with Maverick? It's easy enough to make fun of Candlebox, but what that line represented was the point where ""grunge"" was something all labels felt they needed to ""have,"" even with only a vague idea of what that actually was. You get the idea of something similar here, a clumsy attempt to siphon indie rock's sound and relative commercial momentum with none of its spirit.<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Temple_Pilots"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a></p></div>"|15030.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15030-young-the-giant/|2.7|Ian Cohen

The blissful retro-homage carries over on her solo project, White Sea. <i>This Frontier</i> opens (on ""Mountaineer"") with Kibby's layered voice intoning, ""It's a teen dream,"" over a mountainous synthesizer and a cascade of electronic drum pads. It's familiar territory here in teen-fixated 2011, when, even as 90s mania is in full swing, we just can't shed the 80s. Lighthearted and well-built, the EP captures Kibby in transition, between emerging under the wing of a bulletproof band and defining her own style, which already lurks amid all the glossy nostalgia. It's a roundly enjoyable if embryonic electro-pop debut.</p>
<p>Kibby favors more svelte, less majestic productions than M83, and set free from the anesthetic coo Gonzalez required of her, it turns out that she can seriously <i>sing</i>. Her approachable and earnest delivery can occasionally tip toward cheesiness, though it's mostly winning, and Kibby sculpts it a little differently on each song. Her singing can be floridly enunciated like Imogen Heap, sweetly petulant like Tegan &amp; Sara, or breezily swinging like Metric's Emily Haines. It's matched by a diversity of productions, from the politely sleazy night-disco of ""Ladykiller"" to the frosty pseudo-Italo of ""Cannibal Love"". The dilettantism isn't a problem, but the topicality feels generic, and the bottlenecking reference points don't give us a clear picture of what makes Kibby unique. The best track, ""Overdrawn"", emphasizes her greatest asset-- the mobility and naturalness of her voice-- against a clean, speedy backdrop of bassy synth stabs and buoyant claps. It's more convincing than the Chromatics-style iciness she affects on ""Cannibal Love"" or the Fever Ray-ish abstraction of ""Oljato"".</p>
<p>If <i>This Frontier</i> feels like a dance-pop starter kit, that's essentially what it is. Kibby did have a little help: Jonathan Leahy provided disco bass lines and preppy post-punk guitars, Jonathan Bates did some mixing, and Ray Suen wrote string arrangements. But mostly it's the product of her teaching herself Pro Tools after finishing her big tour with M83. For such a new producer, she has a sharp ear and a direct style. Her classically inclined tracks are a dynamic fit for her voice, and they benefit from her smart, sparing use of cut-up vocal rhythms, splashy drum accents, and cinematic texturing. It suggests that lighter and more concrete formats, rather than darker and more abstract ones, fit Kibby most productively. Now that she's learned to make a solo album that shows us what she likes, she's primed to dig a little deeper next time, and show us something of who she is.</p></div>"|14943.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14943-this-frontier-ep/|6.3|Brian Howe

Ten years ago it would have been unthinkable for a Kompakt mix to open with something as traditional as the minimal deep house of Guillaume &amp; the Coutu Dumonts' ""Odyssee"", as Robag Wruhme does on <i>Wuppdeckmischmampflow</i>. Its stripped-down, jazz-tinged boogie just wasn't within Kompakt's purview, which favored atmosphere over funk. But if the choice doesn't feel like a total curveball in 2011, it's in part because Kompakt's sound has become so wide-ranging that its output seems more defined by mood than any specific production tricks or any subgenre's identifying marks.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the label's name will likely always evoke the lush and moody tech-house and fluffier-than-fluffy ambient it made famous between 1998 and 2002. Those spacious, soft-edged sonics and that inimitable late-night vibe certainly persist on Robag Wruhme's new mix CD, which features plenty of muffled melodies lurking behind static-y textures, synths twinkling against dark bass, and intricately layered, gently flowing beats. But as catholic a selector as any DJ ever tasked by Kompakt to make a mix, Wruhme includes classics Villalobos' ""Dexter"", regardless of how ""dated"" they might feel to some, alongside up-to-the-minute dancefloor cuts and left-field electronica moves from artists like Four Tet, choosing records that chase the same atmosphere rather than what a techno DJ ""should"" be playing in 2011.</p>
<p>It's also often plain gorgeous, the kind of richly detailed home-listening techno that Kompakt's mixes have always promised, albeit taking a new form. While many Kompakt mixes have used smooth extended fades to bridge the gaps between disparate-sounding tracks, here Wruhme makes use of virtuoso in-the-moment sampling, hypnotic snippets of voice, or jittery percussion fills to blend his often wildly diverse selections into a unified whole. That patchwork feel, a lot of tiny elements being smoothly edited together, extends to the tracks themselves, many of which feature rhythm tracks far more antic and poly-percussive than the sleekly gliding pulse Euro-techno Kompakt made famous. Some of the stuttering transitions--like chunky syncopation that leads into Moderat's ""Rusty Nails""-- are downright garage-y, not a genre ever associated with the label before. Others recall a thicker, more voluptuous and sensual take on old-school micro-house.</p>
<p>Idiosyncratic in their choices yet never less than artfully constructed, Kompakt's mixes have always felt more like first-rate mixtapes, of the sort made by one friend for another, rather than an advertisement for the season's latest club smashes. If <i>Wuppdeckmischmampflow</i>, with its nearly decade-old inclusions and tracks taken from outside techno's well-patrolled borders, won't please those looking for dance's next-big-things from their mixes, it's never less than evocative and involving, which are the only two guidelines that count when you take a DJ set out of the club.</p></div>"|15064.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15064-wuppdeckmischmampflow/|8.0|Jess Harvell

In Chicago, the lines between the experimental electronic scene, jazz scene, and rock scene aren't just blurred-- they're practically invisible. The free movement of ideas and musicians between these worlds ideally wouldn't be so rare, but I can't think of another city where jazz and rock musicians have so much currency with each other and play so often in each other's bands and ensembles.</p>
<p>Rob Mazurek has long been one of the key musicians keeping the scene integrated. His projects, including Brokeback, Isotope 217, Tortoise, his own solo albums, and Exploding Star Orchestra, are aggressive about keeping the assumed lines between genres there from solidifying. Exploding Star Orchestra is a six-year-old project led by the trumpeter and cornetist, who now makes his full-time home in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, but is still very much a part of the scene he made his name in. ESO began as a sort of all-star jazz band organized for a concert in Chicago's Millennium Park but eventually became a recording project that made one album of its own and another with the late, great Bill Dixon, to whom this new LP is dedicated. A second dedication is made to the late saxophonist Fred Anderson, who also was an associate of ESO.</p>
<p><i>Stars Have Shapes</i> is therefore an appropriately contemplative record, and very much a Mazurek project in the way it brings together strains of cool jazz with free jazz, ambient electronics, and musique concrÃ¨te into a seamless whole. The sounds of insects, rain, and bicycles are used as accent textures, and Mazurek has his way with tone generators and effects pedals as well, setting a surreal backdrop for the group's improvisations. The album is structured as two long tracks, each followed by a short, more traditional one. The sprawling opener, ""Ascension Ghosts Impression No. 2"", is a stitched-together opus in the <i>Bitches Brew</i> tradition, beginning with thick drones and working its way through squawking free jazz, yet at its center is a gorgeous, fleeting passage of slow, swinging cool jazz that gives the piece a human heart. The other sprawler, ""Three Blocks of Light"", expends more energy on textural playing among the horns and has the effect of being alone in a room full of people engaged in conversation-- chatter everywhere, but nothing directed at you. It eventually resolves to a luminous drone.</p>
<p>The two shorter pieces are far more focused and melodic than their titanic counterparts and are overall the most satisfying tracks on the record. Here, the 13-piece band plays more developed compositions with greater rhythmic drive-- Jason Adasiewicz's clouds of vibraphone provide a sort of through-line to the more ambient pieces. Just as importantly, the short pieces help the album feel balanced by pulling the band back from the margins and anchoring it to its roots. ESO is the type of project that could only really come from its city, and <i>Stars Have Shapes</i> finds the group ably carrying forward the unique modern Chicago jazz aesthetic.</p></div>"|15058.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15058-stars-have-shapes/|7.6|Joe Tangari

The particular digger in question, Sean Canty, was once referred to by <i>Fact</i> magazine as one of Manchester's <a href=""http://www.factmag.com/2009/08/03/modern-loves-mlz-and-canty-get-witchy-as-demdike-stare/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""best-known record collectors,""</a> which is illustrative of the company we're in: People who not only rate records, but rate their collectors. Canty's partner, Miles Whittaker, has been been an associate of  Manchester's <a href=""http://www.modern-love.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Modern Love</a> records for nearly 10 years, primarily  sticking around the kind of eerie, minimal techno that production groups  like <a href=""http://www.basicchannel.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Basic Channel</a> developed in the 1990s. Basically, Canty and  Whittaker are lifers in communities where darkness and obscurity are  tools, not handicaps.</p>
<p>Demdike Stare is primarily a sample-based project, and ""dark"" is its organizing principle. Their logo is a skull, rose, and triangle; the cover of one of their EPsÂ  is a <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/images/reviews/2010/demdike-stare-forest-of-evil.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">visual riff</a> on a Ouija board; and they're named after a 17th-century witch-- a quasi-gothic, English variation on the sci-fi and horror imagery that has saturated the American underground over the past couple of years. The tracks on <i>Tryptych</i> are droning and nightmarish: lots of  close murmuring and distant wind, lots of groaning earth and quietly  whining steam-powered machines, glassy techno keyboards and the buried  wailing of undefined tribes. But like some drone (and most minimal techno) there's usually a build  or a climax, and one of the most consistently satisfy
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
ing things about  listening to <i>Tryptych</i> is that it takes music you might expect to  be purely ambient and shapes it into something with a hump somewhere in  the middle-- something with a narrative to it.</p>
<p>Canty and Whittaker also manage to give their  atmospheres rhythmic inertia and shape their beats in ways that make  them sound like they're emerging from the track's atmosphere. I'm  guessing this comes from Whittaker's time in the world of minimal  techno, where the sound of static can pass for a backing track when  edited and looped just right. <i>Tryptych</i>'s collapsing of background and foreground is a holistic approach that makes their unexpected connections-- between the black ambience of Nurse With Wound, Middle Eastern chant, and minimal  techno-- sound seamless and logical<i>. </i>The result is a style part-techno,  part-drone, part-noise, sometimes European-sounding, sometimes  ambiguously ""ethnic,"" part-heavenly, part-hellish-- a kind of map to a  musical otherworld.</p>
<p>Demdike Stare's influences are well  integrated and their commitment to them feels enduring, and after the  deluge of half-kitschy, self-parodying indie-goth bands last year (GLâ²SS â 33â H  was when I got off the bus), the commitment is refreshing. <i>Tryptich</i> is sample-based but doesn't just suss out some particular cultural  moment and heap static on top of it, it reaches for a moment-- a  confluence of sounds-- that never actually happened. In a <a href=""http://phs.abstractdynamics.org/2010/11/witch_house_dj_screw_and_the_n.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog post</a> on what he called ""the new doom,"" Pitchfork contributor Philip  Sherburne wrote that ""Demdike Stare are even more deserving of the  'witch house' tag [than Salem], given that they're named for an actual  witch and have a deeper connection to actual house music."" True, but I  have no temptation to belittle Demdike Stare with the term<i>.</i></p>
<p><i>Tryptych</i> collects the three EPs they released in 2010 and adds  40 minutes of bonus material to them, which ostensibly leaves you with  an album that's about two and a half hours long. Two and a half hours is  a long time. I'd be lying if I said I had the patience to give it my  full attention from start to finish, but the caveat is that I think  it's best enjoyed either in small listens or in a kind of absent-minded  immersion. It's the kind of thing you can keep turned on but tuned-out-- for bad dreams, adventures into chemical hinterlands, night drives, and so on.</p>
<p>Canty and Whittaker are impressively capable in that  respect: they know exactly what will and won't belong in their creepy  little mood-worlds, and as a result, <i>Tryptych</i> rarely calls  attention to itself. I tried playing it while I slept a few times, and  woke up in the middle of the night with a real <i>oh god, what's going on and how can I make it stop </i>feeling, which in this context is an absolute plus. I in fact <i>recommend</i> that you listen to <i>Tryptych</i> at night-- thematically, it's where the album lives and where it thrives.</p></div>"|15012.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15012-tryptych/|8.3|Mike Powell

The label has a strictly-for-aficionados air about it, not least because their idea of how to present a big release constitutes ""releasing a CD version"" (the label's wares are often vinyl-only and they mostly stay away from digital). As of this writing, the label's website is still a <a href=""http://www.perlon.net/index3.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">giant Flash animation</a> alerting you that Perlon.com is ""Opening Imminently."" Breath: bated.</p>
<p>Perlon's <i>Superlongevity</i> series has served as a clearinghouse for the label in the past, often collecting bushels of their 12""-only singles. The middle volumes can stand tall next to Kompakt's <i>Total 3 </i>and <i>Total 4</i> as essential documents of 2000s techno-- specifically minimal, the hypnotic, spare house offshoot that dominated DJ decks and established Germany as the center of the electronic music world. Perlon's relative obscurity is due partly as well to prolonged silences from some of its bigger artists: <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4505-ricardo-villalobos/"" target=""_blank"">Ricardo Villalobos</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/search/?query=Melchior+Productions&amp;search_type=standard"" target=""_blank"">Melchior Productions</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/10944-stl/"" target=""_blank"">STL</a> have all quieted down or moved their releases elsewhere. (<a href=""http://www.skulldisco.com/people"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shackleton</a>'s <a href=""http://www.discogs.com/Shackleton-Three-EPs/master/189024"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Three EPs</i></a> was the label's last release to gain any traction outside dance circles.) So <i>Superlongevity 5</i> represents a pretty substantial release for the label, not just because it revives a dormant brand name, but because it offers new music from the artists above as well as from standbys like <a href=""http://music.hyperreal.org/bford/baby_ford/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Baby Ford</a>, <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/kalaspatz"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kalabrese</a>, and Shackleton.</p>
<p>Keeping to form, <i>Superlongevity 5</i> is offered as a mix of new or unreleased material spread across two CDs (a limited seven-record vinyl box set was also made available). As a mix, it differs substantially from a stone-skipping DJ set: the tracks are presented in large chunks, usually between five and six minutes, which not only gives each track plenty of room to breathe and develop but also obviates the need to hear ""full"" versions for all but the compulsive. Always the slightly sillier cousin to the starker Kompakt, Perlon has only gotten wilier since their heyday. <i>Superlongevity 5</i> is bursting with weird mantras (""Just being tape!"" from Matt John's ""The Tapedeckers""), tropical horns (Kalabrese's ""The 2010 Kitchen Session""), and rubbery rhythms (everything, really). Dandy Jack's lounge disco ""Show You My Tent"" actually chuckles at itself throughout (or at me?). San Proper's ""Lady Cop"" is a funky noir that features samples of dialogue from ""The Wire""'s beloved Kima Greggs.</p>
<p>Coming for the headliners-- Villalobos, Shackleton, and Melchior arguably have the most cachet here-- is a mistake. <i>Superlongevity 5</i> is a place where everyone wilds out; at times it feels like a group of goofball college buddies meeting up years later. Matthew Dear takes his Jabberjaw moniker out of mothballs; ""Pop Bottle"" features sampled baby nonsense and someone shouting ""I need help!"" Label co-founder Zip teams with Sammy Dee on their Pantytec project and offer the detuned, jazzy ""ZwÃ¶lvis"".</p>
<p>Nothing here settles too heavily. Zip mixes an imposing 28 tracks of carbonated oddities into two hours of vibrant techno. When it's through, it's hard not to compare Perlon's stubborn vinyl adherence and low visibility to the colorful, clever music of its artists. But this is the context in which Perlon has always thrived: mixed among friends and peers. It's techno music for techno fans, but it never makes the mistake of being too serious or exclusive.</p></div>"|15056.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15056-superlongevity-5/|7.8|Andrew Gaerig

Never mind that the first track off their first stateside release (third overall) is titled ""Closer"", and disregard the fact that they've recorded with Steve Albini, or that the group named itself after a Big Black song.  The guitar and drums in ""Closer"" are aggressive and rhythmically focused, recalling the usual cast of post-punk characters: Wire, Gang of Four, the Fall.  The sort of cathartic punch one might also associate with these groups, however, isn't there; it's not something the song is necessarily lacking, but its absence is nonetheless notable.</p>
<p>At first, track two, ""Young"", follows the same tack.  It works up a similar head of steam, but without the sort of tension and release one might expect.  Around the three-minute mark, the more boisterous, guitar-driven song the group seemed to be playing turns out to be a feint.  Instead the rhythm section settles into a calmer version of the track's original beat and rides it out for the next five minutes.  The drummer adds a few rolls and flourishes over this extended outro, but otherwise ""Young"" contentedly sits in this little pocket until the track end.  It's those meditative five minutes that exemplify what My Disco offer on <i>Little Joy</i>; not so much post-punk as post-rock (with a krautrock bent).</p>
<p>No doubt My Disco's particular formula-- to settle into a repetitive groove and ride it steadily for the length of the song-- might strike some as simply formulaic.  How a song begins is, for the most part, how it ends. ""With Age""-- its sharp staccato guitar strums giving way to brief but powerful splashes of amplifier excess-- helps to add some contrast. That said, there's a hypnotic allure to <i>Little Joy</i> and the way most of its songs content themselves with simply staying the course.  Those steady rhythms are definitely soothing, especially when coupled with Liam Andrews' sporadic, minimal mantras.  And when something out of the ordinary appears, like the aforementioned flare-ups in ""With Age"" or the fragmented introduction to ""Sun Bear"", its presence carries much more impact than it would otherwise.  Those out-of-character moments are few and far between, but listeners willing to roll with the lack of punch <i>Little Joy</i> offers will find that shortcoming easy to live with.</p></div>"|15061.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15061-little-joy/|7.1|David Raposa

But Mick Collins has never been content to run his band as <i>just</i> a garage-punk band. Instead, he follows his batshit conceptual tangents wherever they might lead him. Ten years ago, the band released <i>Ultraglide in Black</i>, a collection of covers of classic soul and funk tracks. And even though it's a ballsy move to translate songs by Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye into simplistic stomp-rock bangers, those songs at least shared some structural similarities with the punk songs that the band had already been playing. On the new <i>Party Store</i>, the band leaps even further into uncharted territory, turning in a full hour of classic Detroit techno covers.</p>
<p>Collins' love of techno runs deep. Detroit, of course, has served as a breeding ground for plenty of disparate genres of music, and garage rock and ancestral techno belong to the city the same way transcendent pop-soul and melanin-challenged battle-rap do. Collins himself has been a techno devotee for a long time, and he even made a few techno tracks himself early on. The song selection on <i>Party Store</i> is the work of a true aficionado; canonical classics like ""Strings of Life"" and ""Bug in the Bass Bin"" share space with some truly early electro examples of the form, like Cybotron's ""Cosmic Cars"". But there's still something jarring in hearing a band known for sweaty, loose workouts take on a genre of music where precision and repetition and icy control are paramount.</p>
<p>That's the point, of course, and the album gets a lot of mileage out of the way techno synth-riffs work just fine as punk rock guitar riffs if you play them with the right scratchy intensity. The Dirtbombs have a strong enough rhythm section that the tracks rarely defeat them, and it's fun hearing Collins pitch his wail down to a robotic monotone delivery. Plenty of these old techno tracks are totally silly fun on some level, and Collins knows it. So he delivers the lyrics straight (""Smoking on his cigarette/ Cruising to his car cassette,"" ""Laser beams cloud your dreams""), without any sort of wink.</p>
<p>The whole ridiculous idea reaches its highest state on the band's version of ""Good Life"", an immortal track from Kevin Saunderson's Inner City. (For whatever reason, the band covers the Basement Roots mix rather than the canonical one.) This is a song with actual <i>singing</i> on it, so Collins gets a chance to cut loose vocally, doing a pretty good subdued version of house-diva histrionics. Around him, the band attacks the beat with the same skritchety lunacy that James Chance once applied to James Brown grooves. The end result transcends the silliness of the concept and turns into something that Flipper would've been proud of.</p>
<p>But as fun as the album is, there's a big problem sitting right at its center: a 21-minute take on ""Bug in the Bass Bin"", the evolutionary leftfield track from Carl Craig's Innerzone Orchestra. Craig himself shows up on the Dirtbombs' version, playing some awesomely trashy keyboards, but the song is still an endless marathon of splintered, discordant guitars that takes up more than a third of an album that's a party otherwise. You can hear Collins straining for ""Maggot Brain"" expressionism, but you need a genius guitarist like Funkadelic's Eddie Hazel to pull off ""Maggot Brain"", and Collins isn't it. Still, even if the Dirtbombs' version of ""Bug in the Bass Bin"" isn't anything you need to hear more than twice, it's weirdly heartening that the band actually <i>tried</i> it. Like the album that surrounds it, it's an awesomely doomed attempt at an idea that nobody's ever really tried before. And even if these Dirtbombs covers don't take on their own lives the way the <i>Ultraglide in Black</i> covers did, you still have to respect their gall.</p></div>"|15066.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15066-party-store/|6.8|Tom Breihan

Like many of his peers, David Sztanke-- a Parisian musician and leader of the expansive 1970s pop revival outfit Tahiti Boy and the Palmtree Family-- always had a thing for Brazilian TropicÃ¡lia trailblazers Os Mutantes. After a few happy networking accidents, Sztanke found himself in direct communication with Os Mutantes head honcho SÃ©rgio Dias, who confessed to digging the Palmtree Family's stuff so much, he proposed they get together and make a record. The result is <i>We Are the Lilies</i>, a jubilant, cleanly presented appropriation of both musicians' styles that charms with skill and contagious energy.</p>
<p>Backing Dias and Sztanke is the Palmtree Family (and a few very notable guests), a band so open and adaptable, their endless incorporation of different instruments and styles seems breezy and effortless. Tracks are jam-packed with horns, sitars, keys, and more percussive elements than you can list, but their ambition never trumps their professionalism. The songs themselves feel very much the property of Sztanke and lean heavily on his eclectic brand of power-pop. It's hard to tell just how much direct influence Dias had on these recordings: In a short album teaser video (which promises a forthcoming companion film), we see band members working diligently in the studio, intercut with shots of Dias only strumming and advising, looking comfortable in his role as celebrity advisee. In a larger sense, Dias' influence is undeniable, both in the fact that you can hear a great deal of Os Mutantes in Tahiti Boy and the Palmtree Family, and that everyone involved seems so genuinely jazzed to be working with him.</p>
<p>That enthusiasm makes <i>We Are the Lilies</i> a spirited, earnest kind of record, but in a way that simply communicates the joy of collaboration and input. Even when songs come across as a little too eager or excited (they often do-- ""Over My Head"" suggests the Polyphonic Spree dabbling in sitcom theme songs), the engaging genre variations (60s French pop, Latin-tinged funk, Motown) help pad things a bit. Still, the choicest material here refrains from throwing everything into the mix all at once: ""We're Gonna Live Forever"" is essentially a doo-wop tune centered around Beatles-esque vocal harmonies, ""Sarava"" boasts a rockier edge but oozes pure soul, and the excellent closer ""Oh Bahia"" is the expectedly solid Os Mutantes big-up.</p>
<p>But the two big moments on <i>We Are the Lilies</i> come courtesy of special guests Iggy Pop and Jane Birkin (the actress/ singer most famous for her recordings with ex-husband Serge Gainsbourg), and both are most unexpected. The Iggy-assisted ""Why?"" is great fun, but almost only because he seems be having most of it (""Why do the French smoke? Why do Americans fight? Why do Brazilians dance?"" he yelps over a spotty appropriation of a little Motor City rumble). Birkin's ""Marie"" fares better with its stripped-down approach, channeling <i>Blue</i>-era Joni Mitchell with a bit of that perfectly flat-but-pretty French affectation.</p>
<p>Tahiti Boy and the Palmtree Family have created a bright environment to play in, and they make the most of it for Dias, who must dig the unbridled enthusiasm of these young musicians sprouting in his honor. In this sense, <i>We Are the Lilies</i> comes off like well-executed dinner party, where both the guest and host seem to be enjoying themselves in equal measure.</p></div>"|15049.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15049-we-are-the-lilies/|6.4|Zach Kelly

It's certainly not because ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQIyqtTe6Tc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Glow</a>"" was a standout on the record; there were no standouts on that just-making-the-grade effort. Doesn't help, either, that the song is disjointed and fails to find a pocketed groove that'll stick. If anything, RJ's lyrics are what's to focus on here, as they oddly embrace old-fashioned wealth signifiers like white tablecloths, tans, and gold wrists. There's also some talk about not having to vote or pay taxes, but the whole thing is ""political"" the way <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3021-nerd/"" target=""_blank"">N.E.R.D.</a>'s ""politicians they soundin' like strippers to me"" line in ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiG0tcTraGA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lapdance</a>"" is.</p>
<p>""The Glow"" is a song about feeling yourself, and the producer born Ramble John Krohn has had good reason to indulge in recent years. After watching folks' ""Next DJ Shadow"" predictions sadly come true with the release of 2007's utterly horrible, rock-heavy third album <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9966-the-third-hand/"" target=""_blank""><i>The Third Hand</i></a>, it looked like RJ's fortunes resided alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3384-prefuse-73/"" target=""_blank"">Prefuse 7</a><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3384-prefuse-73/"" target=""_blank"">3</a>'s in the used CD bin. Lucky for him, then, when his instrumental for ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phnIXtJBI5E"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Beautiful Mine</a>"", from 2006's collaborative <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18-magnificent-city/"" target=""_blank""><i>Magnificent City</i></a> LP with rapper <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/11-aceyalone/"" target=""_blank"">Aceyalone</a>, was used as the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQU2Bni1ae0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">theme song</a> to ""<a href=""http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mad Men</a>"". Because of this, more people have heard RJD2's music on a regular basis than the number of people who bought <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6798-since-we-last-spoke/"" target=""_blank""><i>Since We Last Spoke</i></a>; it's also very likely that this slice of synergy has kept RJ well-fed.</p>
<p>So the mood here, it seems, is celebratory, and the remixers tapped to do their stuff here are well aware. For the most part, they lean heavily on that pitchy, lost-from-the-Big-Beat-era vocal hook, recontextualizing it to reflect on some of dance music's more ubiquitous preoccupations at the moment.  Chicago's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/labels/3051-fools-gold/"" target=""_blank"">Fool's Gold</a>-affiliated duo <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/6293-flosstradamus/"" target=""_blank"">Flosstradamus</a> apply disco-edit touches, stretching the tune out by a few minutes with a patient beat that is easy enough to leave on, if slightly unremarkable. Italian composer and fan-chosen remix contest winner <a href=""http://www.paolopalazzo.it/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paolo Palazzo</a> takes a more kitchen-sink approach, folding everything into an asthmatic slurp of a rhythm that fits with the sonic aspirations of California's <a href=""http://www.lowendtheoryclub.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Low End Theory</a> beat scene. It's UK producer <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/thecandypanther"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Candy Panther</a>, however, who files the most intriguing take here, experimenting with low pitches and shades of dark melody in a way that calls out to the dronier work of his brethren in the <a href=""http://nightslugs.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Night Slugs</a> crew-- specifically, the grime-flecked <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/jamcitytrax"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jam City</a> and tunnel-house alchemist <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/africaforyou"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Egyptrixx</a>.</p>
<p>So, no one is doing bad work here-- but there's nothing essential either, which might prompt fans to look this particular gift horse in the mouth (unless they're really into the included <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQIyqtTe6Tc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cars-and-dolls video</a> for ""The Glow"", which is not likely). Was this release really a gift to begin with, though? Celebratory angle aside, RJ has another decent reason to go about raising his profile right now: he's about to release an LP under a new moniker, <a href=""http://rjd2.bandcamp.com/album/we-are-the-doorways"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Insane Warrior</a>, which is said to take cues from horror and sci-fi soundtracks. <i>The Glow Remixes</i>, then, becomes less of a generous offering and more of a profile-raising promotional tool.</p></div>"|15053.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15053-the-glow-remixes-ep/|5.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

So Radio 4 and Hot Hot Heat and, yeah, Le Tigre, aimed to make a dent in the dying alt-rock radio format, burnished off their edges, polished up their guitars, and cranked out records that worked as anonymous, lifeless versions of the fiery, exciting music that'd made them interesting in the first place.</p>
<p>Of all those bands, Le Tigre might've been the saddest story. When they first roared into existence five years earlier, they took the rip-snorting howl that Kathleen Hanna had perfected leading Bikini Kill and used it for something new: rudimentary but guns-blazing dance-pop that kept all the energy of her older band. Hanna had that same withering sneer and dizzy joy in her voice she always had, but now she was using it to make amped-up party jams like ""Deceptacon"", a song that felt like a new world opening up the first time you heard it. But by the time they got to 2004's Universal bow <i>This Island</i>, much of that livewire vitality was gone. Their message was still a righteous beacon ofÂ feministÂ unity, but their choruses just weren't sticking anymore, and the group pretty much blinked out of existence soon after.</p>
<p>JD Samson wasn't in Le Tigre when they released that clarion call of a debut album, but she was on board by the time they dropped the still-pretty-great follow-up, <i>Feminist Sweepstakes</i>. And now that Le Tigre have been on hiatus for the better part of a decade, she's the first of the group's three members to work up an album's worth of material. In MEN, she's crewed up with friends Michael O'Neill and Ginger Brooks Takahashi, but she's the leader and figurehead of the group, the visible member. Visibility is a big concept for Samson. With her strikingly masculine appearance, Samson's mere existence has probably helped more than a few kids develop some confidence of their own. That's the idea, anyway; in a recent <i>L.A. Weekly</i> interview, Samson says that her main goal in Le Tigre was always to reach the queer kids. And that keeps going with MEN; plenty of the songs on their debut album are pitched as anthems: ""We want some options/ There is a way."" And that's great; but unfortunately, those sentiments are still musically stuck in that 2004 moment that destroyed so many promising bands.</p>
<p>To hear Samson tell it, the Le Tigre of <i>This Island</i> had worked hard on their music-making ability, and they could do things that they weren't able to do a few years earlier; that leap toward competence is what drove away so many of the longtime fans who loved their DIY edge. Except she's only got the story half-right; that DIY edge went a long way toward making the band dangerous and unpredictable and willing to devote an entire (great) song to their own conflicted feelings about the filmmaker John Cassavetes. <i>Talk About Body</i> builds itself around outmoded ideas of what moves dance floors; the beats are slick and professional enough that they've got no trace of any punk-rock basement-show roots, but they aren't big or inventive enough that they can carve out dancefloor space next to the Ke$has of the world. And virtually the whole album stays locked in the same midtempo clippety-bloop rut-- processed guitars, dinky keyboard riffs, total lack of dynamics. MEN want to reach as many people as possible, but the way to make a pop-music impression is not to be boringly professional.</p>
<p>Samson's sloganeering could use some work, too. If you're trying to write a song about the challenges of raising kids feminist, you're going to need to come with something more nuanced than ""Radical politics/ Sontag in the crib"". Also, ""multimedia performances"" is the sort of phrase that just isn't meant to be sung. If Samson's voice had the full-blooded verve of her old bandmate Hanna, she might be able to sell this stuff. Instead, she delivers all the album's lyrics in the same flat monotone, and she just sounds <i>bored</i> the whole time. Maybe <i>Talk About Body</i> will be a big help to some kids who really need it; I don't know. But if you don't need the album, you probably won't have much use for it, either.</p></div>"|15044.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15044-talk-about-body/|4.1|Tom Breihan

Sure, he says, it may be temporarily forgotten or wrongly remembered by the masses as John Travolta and platform shoes, but the music itself is too great to ever truly perish, there will always be keepers of the flame keeping it real. If Ice-T had delivered a similar speech at the end of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vtIXFxfnfU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo</i></a>, you might have the manifesto for <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/drkprty"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dark Party</a>: Electro will never die. And their debut full-length <i>Light Years</i> provides good reason to cheer the genre's longevity, or at least its modern revival.</p>
<p>Dark Party is the duo of industrious producer <a href=""http://eliotlipp.blogspot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eliot Lipp</a> and the lesser-known <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/leo123music"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Leo 123</a>, whose scant credits so far include a production for L.A. underground rapper <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/subtitle"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Subtitle</a> and some previous appearances alongside Lipp. The latter's debut was released by hip-hop instrumentalist Guillermo Scott Herren of <a href=""http://www.prefuse73.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Prefuse 73</a>, and for several albums, Lipp applied his own bright gloss to that style. In 2009, though, Lipp dropped <i>Peace Love Weed 3D</i>, a grinning but uneven album that began taking things in a more distinctively electro direction. Maybe part of what the less prolific Leo 123 brings to Dark Party is a more exacting level of quality control, because the duo's long-gestating debut, <i>Light Years</i>, is an unflagging blast, the sort of non-stop electro party that <i>Peace Love </i>pointed toward but didn't entirely deliver.</p>
<p>Old-school electro isn't exactly an unusual angle these days, but Dark Party kick it with more concision than <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/damfunk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DÃ¢m-Funk</a>'s wandering jams and with deeper sound design than, say, Copy's analog monophonia. ""Down"" has a reedy vocoder hook that evokes Daft Punk circa a couple of helmet upgrades ago. ""Tonight"" features chicken-scratch guitar and luxurious plush bass. ""Tina"" even achieves the feel of a live, if keyboard-equipped, band rocking out, with its acoustic drum sounds and its loose fills and guitar strokes. Multiple tracks add chopped-up vocal samples to the mix, from the diva garble of ""Status"" to ""Feets"", with its chanting command to ""get your feet, get your feet, get your feet up in the air""-- an inversion of the more common hip-hop request (hands) that all but demands headspins and b-boy acrobatics.</p>
<p>Even when they're just having fun with their synthesizers, the results are consistently catchy. The synth glissandos of ""Easy"" slide up and down octaves in the finest g-funk style. A teasing keyboard trill on ""Fifth"" resolves into an archly dramatic little melody. Grounding everything is an unshakable foundation of thick 808 kicks and similarly vintage drum machine claps, snares, and clicks. At 50 minutes long, the album manages not to lag until the very last, with the mellow <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLCeQVM1aZw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MPC</a> bumps and synth noodling of ""Cab Weather"" feeling like a nice, relaxing ride home. At which point you'll want to start the party again.</p></div>"|15028.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15028-light-years/|7.6|Eric Grandy

<p>To be fair, <i>For the Whole World to See </i>set a high bar. By the time they hit the studio, Bobby, David, and Dannis Hackney-- a trio of Detroit-based, African-American brothers who temporarily set aside their Motown roots for steam-rolling proto-punk after checking out an Alice Cooper concert-- had their chops down pat. During their original, five-year lifespan, Death didn't make many waves. A self-released 7""-single, ""Keep on Knocking"" b/w ""Politicians in My Eyes"", was the group's only official release. It quickly faded into the record collector-ether. But listening now, the music sounds visionary-- a missing link between MC5 and the hardcore punk of the early 1980s. The songs are performed at blistering speed, burbling over with bad attitude. Death were not messing around. In just 27 minutes and seven songs, the trio made a potent argument for its place on punk's Mount Olympus.</p>
<p>But <i>Spiritual, Mental, Physical </i>is the sound of the band figuring out its chops one freewheeling basement jam at a time. The takes are raw-- most of them recorded live to two-track tape in the band's practice space. They're loose and, frequently, unfocused. In a few instances, Death's brilliance is clearly evident. ""Views"", a choogling riff-rocker that kicks off the collection, wouldn't have sounded out of place on <i>For the Whole World to See</i>. ""The Masks"" explodes with heavy-metal thrashing, but quickly dials back the fury for a verse lifted directly from the Beatles' ""Got to Get You Into My Life"". The song's main trick-- leap-frogging back and forth between mellow melodies and full-bore grind-- is one that the band would put to more polished use on songs like ""Let the World Turn"" and ""Politicians in My Eyes"", from the <i>For the Whole World to See</i> sessions.</p>
<p>But the record's B-side is padded with less revelatory material-- solo-instrumentals, psychedelic asides, and half-finished song ideas. Aside from ""The Storm Within"", a garage-leveling three-minute freak-out, it's mostly unremarkable.Â If anything the collection proves that Death were not produced into existence during a handful of studio sessions. Even goofing off in the practice space, their musicianship is clear, even if their vision hadn't totally solidified. The majority of <i>Spiritual, Mental, Physical </i>was recorded in a practice space, with no intention of public release. It's a collection of unguarded, unconsidered moments. On <i>For the Whole World to See</i>, Death were getting down to business. Here, they're having a good time.</p></div>"|15060.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15060-spiritual-mental-physical/|5.3|Aaron Leitko

The astonishingly young <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/nicolasjaar"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nicolas Jaar</a> has emerged in the shadow of that endpoint, and he has pursued a sound that cuts diagonally across modern house and techno's continuum of revivalist simplicity to outrÃ© sound design. This range can be heard from his straightforwardly lush disco edits to the generous use of silence and repetition on his forthcoming solo album, <i>Space Is Only Noise</i>.</p>
<p>It's as if Jaar is simply adding new lines across post-minimal's completed coloring book, straining through sheer craft to change the tone and feel of the pictures. This restlessness gives his work the feel of being transitory, offering no statement of a fully formed aesthetic, only snapshots of resting places between one mode and the next. Somewhat perversely, the most coherent articulation of Jaar's approach is captured on a release not even in his name. Strictly speaking, <i>InÃ¨s</i> is a compilation of output on Jaar's experiment-slanted <a href=""http://www.clownandsunset.com/cs/main.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Clown &amp; Sunset</a> label, though as compilations go it's very single-minded: four of the 10 tracks here are from Jaar, and he collaborates with artists <a href=""http://www.clownandsunset.com/cs/soul.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soul Keita</a> and <a href=""http://www.clownandsunset.com/cs/nikita.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nikita Quasim</a> on two others, while Keita and Quasim offer two solo tracks each.</p>
<p><i>InÃ¨s</i> is also single-minded in feel in spite of its sonic diversity, each track asking different versions of the same questions: what is the relationship between groove and non-groove, between chaos and order? Does the sun shine more brightly if it suddenly emerges from behind clouds? While stylistic contexts differ, from the softly popping Jan Jelinek downtempo of Quasim's ""Freshman Year"" with its woozy accelerations and decelerations, to the loping blues-disco stomp of Jaar's ""Love You Gotta Lose Again"" to the morose and mysterious instrumental hip-hop of Keita's ""Dusties N 808s"", everything here points to an underlying sensibility of absolute looseness finding itself pressed into the service of the beat.</p>
<p>If that sounds like Downtempo 101, well, it is; <i>InÃ¨s</i>' point of distinction is the deliberateness of its constructions. They are simultaneously more fragmentary and more intricate, more tentative and more precise than your standard narcoleptic headnodder, with tracks that are rigid with barely restrained tension. So, the seemingly adrift piano tinkles of Jaar's ""Tribute to My Mother"" become drawn into a cat's-cradle of electronic zaps and buzzing bass surges, while on his ""Dubliners"" papery rustles and scratches gradually coalesce into an eerie percussive house groove, like cells becoming molecules before your eyes. Best of all is the entire collective's ""Her String"", where succulent hand percussion and live bass build to a gorgeously deliquescent flamenco guitar solo.</p>
<p>With its fragile, whispery pools and eddies of sound, <i>InÃ¨s</i> recalls the rhythmically attenuated constructions of Villalobos (in particular his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8508-achso/"" target=""_blank""><i>Achso</i></a> EP) but also <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/henrikschwarz"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Henrik Schwarz</a>'s naturalist dance music fusions. But unlike these artists, Jaar and company remain determinedly small scale, preferring to offer carefully constructed pinnacles that never outstay their welcome. As such, it's easy to dismiss <i>InÃ¨s</i> as a minor work, to conclude that the delicacy of its articulations feel hard-won only because they're staged that way. All of which is true, but once you're on the album's microscopic level of activity even the slightest developments feel immensely evocative.</p></div>"|15062.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15062-ines/|7.7|Tim Finney

The band's songwriter, producer, and creative director, Andy Butler,  remains in place, as does DJ/vocalist Kim Ann Foxman, but the others who  lent their talents to the debut-- including singers Antony  Hegarty and Nomi Ruiz, DFA producer Tim Goldsworthy, and !!! bassist  Tyler Pope-- are replaced by a new team on a new label. Among the recruits are  vocalists Aerea Negrot and Shaun Wright, and Bay Area producer Mark  Pistel, whose previous credits include the Disposable Heroes of  Hiphoprisy and industrial acts Meat Beat Manifesto and Consolidated.</p>
<p>So be it; HLA was always a producer's group, and besides, Butler's taking a distinctly different tack on this album. Where <i>Hercules and Love Affair</i> built on the lush, rich sound of 1970s disco, <i>Blue Songs</i> is much more a house record-- specifically, house as it was understood around 1987, when Chicago sounded like the center of the musical universe. Its strongest tracks aim right at that target. ""My House"", in particular, is both a convincing pastiche of the heyday of Marshall Jefferson and Frankie Knuckles and a commentary on it from a remove of 20 years. (""My house is in order,"" goes the hook; how did nobody manage to think of that pun at the time?)</p>
<p>As the album rolls on, though, Butler fails to recapture the chemistry he had with previous vocalists. Negrot and Wright are not quite anonymous, but lack the dynamic presence of previous contributors. While it's interesting to hear how his style works in a pop-house context, Kele Okereke of Bloc Party's guest appearance on ""Step Up"" falls flat, and the song's chorus (""Baby, you might just be like this/ Baby, this might be who you are"") is hardly juicy enough to bring the track to life on its own. Nearly every dance track here still has something to recommend, like the mock-serious Grace Jones impression on ""Answers Come in Dreams"", or the swooping bass that introduces ""Falling"". ""Visitor"" distinctly recalls what Marshall Jefferson was doing when <i>he</i> went by the name Hercules on the 1986 single ""7 Ways"". But apart from ""My House"", nothing here feels like a complete package, and especially not the way ""Blind"", ""Athene"", ""You Belong"", and ""Hercules Theme"" did last time.</p>
<p>Two slower songs in the middle of the album nearly derail it. ""Boy Blue"" has the incantatory, repetitious tone of house, but it's arranged around acoustic guitar and woodwinds and outstays its welcome considerably. It's followed by an earnest chillout-room tune called ""Blue Song"", featuring Butler's own voice rather aggressively high in the mix. Butler has <a href=""http://www.omgblog.com/2010/07/omg_a_qa_with_andy_butler_from.php"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">talked about</a> wanting to demonstrate his ""ability to write more than a four-to-the-floor dance track."" The thing is, he's <i>really good</i> at writing four-to-the-floor dance tracks, and the other stuff is nowhere near as interesting.</p>
<p><i>Blue Songs</i> closes with a meandering, beatless six-minute cover of another Jefferson production, Sterling Void's 1987 house single ""It's All Right"". That song was also covered, much more famously (and effectively), by Pet Shop Boys in 1989, which means that making it a part of this album album can't help but call up comparisons to the PSBs' version. (HLA also spell the song's title as ""It's Alright"", like the Boys.) Is Butler commenting on the relationship between house and pop music? Is he reclaiming house from some version of the mainstream? Is he just underscoring his own sources? It's hard to tell: So much of the album is straining to be more than <i>just</i> an homage to the club sounds of the late 80s that it ends up being a bit less.</p></div>"|15050.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15050-blue-songs/|6.6|Douglas Wolk

The Scroggins sisters came of age in a South Bronx eviscerated by Robert Moses' Cross Bronx Expressway-- a neighborhood carved up by projects and abandoned by government. Their mother bought them instruments in the hope that her girls might devote themselves to music and stay out of trouble. And they did. Her deal with them stipulated they had to give  her a performance every week, and the band the teenaged sisters formed (with occasional minor assistance from a few neighborhood guys) became ESG. The ""E"" and ""S"" stand for emerald and sapphire, the birthstones of Valerie and Renee Scroggins. The ""G"" is for gold, which is what they wanted their records to be certified.</p>
<p>The gold records never came, but something even more unexpected did: The band developed a sound unlike any other and quite by accident became a major influence on hip-hop, dance music, and dance-punk, fitting right in with New York City's arty downtown scene and the UK's vibrant post-punk explosion. Their 1981 debut EP, recorded by Martin Hannett after the band was discovered at a talent show by 99 Records founder Ed Bahlman, is among the most sampled records around-- ""UFO"" alone as been reused several dozen times, by Public Enemy, the Beastie Boys, N.W.A., Big Daddy Kane, EPMD, Liars, DJ Qbert, DJ Shadow, Girl Talk, and Nine Inch Nails.</p>
<p>It's easy to hear why the band's work is so ripe for sampling. It's uniquely spartan music, driven by economical drumming, tersely phrased bass, and minimal, sometimes even surf-y guitar parts. Marie and Renee's vocals and lyrics take a similarly minimal approach-- chanting, repeating phrases, taunting, nearly rapping, nearly singing. On ""Erase You"", Renee takes center stage, delivering a deliciously snotty, assured put-down. It's easy to see why the band was embraced in punk circles-- that song has a nasty guitar tone and tense rhythm that wouldn't sound out of place on a Public Image Ltd. album, and their music was brilliantly concise. The sisters quickly realized where they fit.</p>
<p>The band's debut EP and first album are nearly perfect, and Fire's <i>Dance to the Best of ESG</i> acknowledges that, including all three studio tracks from the first EP and all but two songs from <i>Come Away With ESG</i> on the first of its two discs. None of it has aged: ""UFO"" still sounds intense and weird; ""Moody"", which is heard in its original version and three other variations, is tough and sleek, a clear house antecedent; and ""Chistelle"" is a demented surf-punk romp that seems to be a case of convergent evolution with the Fall. ""My Love For You"" remains fantastically funky, mimicking the ""My love for you, baby, is like a rollercoaster"" opening line in its gonzo rhythm.</p>
<p>The songs aren't sequenced chronologically, but most of disc one is devoted to those releases and the band's self-titled 1991 album, while disc two concentrates on 12""s and later EP tracks. A few songs from the band's 2002 and 2006 albums for Soul Jazz, with Valerie and Renee's daughters in the group, pop up in the running order, too, sounding remarkably of a piece with the older material-- organizing by chronology becomes less important when a band's vision is this consistent. The set ends with three songs from the 1992 EP <i>Sample Credits Don't Pay Our Bills</i>, which is perhaps a subtle way of telling the band's side of the story of their immense influence. Even today, Renee has a company on retainer to track down payment for uncredited samples, and the band's bitterness over others achieving success on the back of their music while they toiled in obscurity and kept day jobs is obvious, in both the music and the liner notes to this set.</p>
<p>The need to have a company constantly searching for uncleared samples of their work is also a measure of the band's impact, of course. They started out as unpretentious amateurs accidentally bridging the gap between dance parties and art scenes, went on to play the opening of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ha%C3%A7ienda"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the HaÃ§ienda</a> and the closing of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Garage"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paradise Garage</a>, and can now be satisfied that what they did really meant something. If you've never heard ESG, you could be forgiven for approaching them with some skepticism. A lot of obscure bands are lauded as influential and essential by critics and other musicians, only to disappoint when you actually hear them, but ESG are the real deal. The music isn't just influential and important, it's exciting too, and very much its own thing. This set is a good place for beginners to get acquainted.</p></div>"|15040.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15040-dance-to-the-best-of-esg/|8.4|Joe Tangari

Given the album's tastelessly terrific title (and I say that as a huge <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Year_of_Magical_Thinking"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Joan Didion fan</a>) and the subject matter of its opening cut, I was all geared up for a full-fledged diary of inebriation. Sadly, the record's handle turns out to be essentially a throwaway joke.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean Flournoy doesn't have plenty of other depressants at his disposal. There's lots of love and sex gone bad on the album, as well as seeming allusions to abused substances that don't come in a bottle. Flournoy largely balances out these bum trips with basically the same brand of melodically driving pop-rock he proffered with the Broken West. Unsurprisingly, he frequently evokes other artists with a rich history of blending buoyant rhythms with deflated or heartsick lyrics-- witness the early-Wilco moves on the insistent rocker ""Under the Gun"" or the R.E.M.-ish bassline on the chimingly wistful ""I Know These Waters Well"". That said, Flournoy's bread-and-butter style can start to feel pretty anonymous after a while, as evidenced by the boilerplate likes of ""The Party Line"", ""Teenage Blood"", and ""Elemental Ways of Speaking"", and it certainly doesn't help that the words to those songs are equally undistinguished, full of vague impressions and empty jargon.</p>
<p>To his credit, Flournoy breaks up the facile pop-rock monotony a few times, with encouraging results. ""My My Mind"" and ""Burn Me Alive"" both exhibit a cool, atmospheric sway that proves to be a good look for Flournoy (the latter even finding him unpacking an admirable falsetto), while ""Holy Roller"" displays just the right light touch of country and gospel. The closing ""Coming To"" stands out from the pack as well thanks to a little cowbell and guitar ruckus, and also features the album's best line, with Flournoy stringing together the set-up of the song's title with the punchline, ""a bed near you."" The irreverence suits him well; maybe Flournoy should consider a year of magical winking.</p></div>"|15036.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15036-the-year-of-magical-drinking/|5.8|Joshua Love

The German label Kompakt, an authority in the field, has driven both its evolution and the entrenchment of certain habits in the last decade. Label co-founder Wolfgang Voigt's ambient techno with Gas and other projects inspired a generation of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12741-glider/"">frank imitators</a>, even as his label's <i>Pop Ambient</i> compilations have pushed the limits of what ambient can entail. The term has picked up such varied connotations since Brian Eno coined it that it's become hard to define clearly. As usual, this year's <i>Pop Ambient </i>entry is an opportunity to take the temperature of what ambient means right now.</p>
<p><i>Pop Ambient 2011</i> does suggest some common properties of modern ambient music. It assumes an air of immutability-- then, it changes. It features cyclical phrases, layered drones, sculptural textures, and flashes of traditional instrumentation. It avoids crisp delineation of sections, obscuring its internal dynamics to create a sense of traveling without moving. It has more in common with abstract visual art than other music-- it calls attention to its materials and features enigmatic subjects, like the scraped and peeled paint fields of <a href=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_oJw2_ZIibZU/Swxf2n93t-I/AAAAAAAAAzU/wThbn-3TZgQ/s1600/imgGerhardRichter2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gerhard Richter</a>, the colored light sculptures of <a href=""http://fnewsmagazine.com/wp/2009/10/it-is-what-it-is-dan-flavin-at-donald-young-gallery/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dan Flavin</a>, and especially the monumental land art of <a href=""http://www.njn.net/arts/starts/pressroom/2402/SmithsonSpiralJetty.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robert Smithson</a>. Ambient insists that music is already latent in the raw terrain of sound.</p>
<p>But <i>Pop Ambient 2011</i> provides exceptions to every rule. ""Bernsteinzimmer"" by ANBB (that's Alva Noto and Blixa Bargeld) conveys an abstracted but palpable narrative via harmonic development and whispers that suddenly break into an authoritative voice. Against the notion that ambient music is sonic wallpaper, it shockingly commandeers the foreground. Triola's ""Dunkelraum"" also taps into the current vogue for submerged voices, but otherwise is merely an inert bed of tone and texture that represents ambient music at its most pro forma.</p>
<p>Mikkel Metal and Bhutan Tiger Rescue take the ""pop"" part to heart. The former's ""The Other Side Of You"" places dreamy piano and drums amid a radiant synthetic sunburst. The latter's ""Beginner's Waltz"" is built around three lustrous tones that sway endlessly, splashed with sleigh bells and ethereal harmonies. Here, ambient music is something superficial; a haze gathering around repetitive tunes. That's not a ringing endorsement, but it's hard to get mad at pretty songs for conceptual reasons, and the Bhutan Tiger Rescue track has an especially memorable mood. At the other extreme, Crato conceives of ambient as something closer to noise or drone-metal: ""30.6.1881"" is a grayscale dirge midway between Infinite Body and Svarte Greiner, spooky but rote.</p>
<p>But the most fertile influence on this year's comp is classical music. Voigt offers orchestral halos that wax and wane majestically, like an overdubbed Arvo PÃ¤rt symphony. Marsen Jules splices Glassian piano minimalism with a coiled, pouncing filter odyssey, and the Orb's Thomas Fehlmann creates a ""cover"" of <a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4138241031160036531#"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mahler's First</a>. Best of all is label co-founder JÃ¼rgen Paape's huge, swooping ""Ein SchÃ¶ner Land"". Like Voigt's offering, it has more false endings than a James Brown song, and a dramatic sense of tension and release. Its shapes are stalwart and high-relief. Nothing feels vague or accidental. These are bona fide compositions, relying on traditional building blocks like tonality, counterpoint, and motivic development instead of the haphazard interaction of shimmering tones-- a style that some of Kompakt's artists seem content with, even as the founders who enshrined it keep pushing forward.</p></div>"|15043.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15043-pop-ambient-2011/|6.8|Brian Howe

For each of their two performances in Austin, the band corralled crowds into a massive parking lot tent and then into a ring of eight speakers, with images designed by local artist (and <i>Dazed and Confused</i> star) Wiley Wiggins projected overhead via an eight-channel video system. The Octopus Project, a band obviously devoted to numbers in the past, dubbed the work <i>Hexadecagon</i>, the name of a 16-sided polygon and, it would seem, an acknowledgement of their hope to surround and possibly overwhelm the audience with stimuli. ""If there's a such thing as a happiness seizure, be prepared to have one,"" <i>Paste</i> exclaimed. Apparently, it worked.</p>
<p>Reduced from its eight-channel origins to (as the band now intends) a pair of headphones, and without its video accompaniment, <i>Hexadecagon</i> feels like little more than a who's-who of important-to-indie-kids instrumental music. That approach-- all glittering midsections, sudden uproars, and clattering codas-- presents some worthy passages but a predictable whole. Every build, just like every collapse, feels as though modified from a textbook, meaning <i>Hexadecagon</i> generally delivers you to exactly where you might've guessed. The playful inquisitiveness that made previous LPs <i>Hello, Avalanche</i> and <i>One Ten Hundred Thousand Million</i> fan favorites is replaced here by a seriousness that shackles the band to their stylistic predecessors.</p>
<p><i>Hexadecagon</i>, however, is nothing if not expertly played. The tessellating rhythms of ""Glass Jungle"", the stutters and starts of ""Catalog"", the stacking blocks of ""Korakrit""-- these aren't at all simple. The band makes some nifty instrumental choices, too, whether that be the warm vinyl loop over which ""A Phantasy"" rises or the countermelodies that run so rich in ""Hallucinists"". But the Octopus Project is an instrumental rock band, not a group of garage rock misfits more dependent on feeling than faculty.</p>
<p>The best instrumental rock, asks, ""What is this band without its chops?"" and returns favorably with answers like imagination, ambition, and unrest. And maybe in the packed hometown houses of Austin, where the Octopus Project played this music surrounded by walls of speakers and screens, the synesthetic experience felt bigger than its parts or its players. But on this double LP, these eight pieces simply feel like cold readings of work that suggest past masters, not an attempt to reinvent them. If there's lysergic, swirling art overhead, maybe that missing component-- interesting, compelling music-- is easier to overlook. But <i>Hexadecagon</i> comes complete with colorful liner notes, not a disco ball. Guess you just had to be there.</p></div>"|15047.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15047-hexadecagon/|4.6|Grayson Currin

Using a literal interpretation of the concept of ""art rock,"" Can famously approached recording much like sculptors, chiseling down extended, amorphous jams into moreÂ manageableÂ forms, if not quite linear songs. Fujiya &amp; Miyagi simply take this logic one step further, distilling the syncopated grooves and mantric incantations of Can circa <i>Ege Bamyasi</i> or <i>Future Days</i> into accessible dance pop. (Even the band's M.O.-- British guys operating under a Japanese alias to make Teutonic funk-- is redolent of Can's multicultural composition and ethos.)</p>
<p>But there is, of course, a crucial distinction between Fujiya &amp; Miyagi and their forebears-- F&amp;M's preference for steely precision and sleek minimalism means that their music lacks the volatility and mercurial quality that made Can's work so eminently fascinating. And while they've enlisted a somewhat surprising choice of producer for <i>Ventriloquizzing</i>-- Devendra Banhart/Vetiver compatriot Thom Monahan-- the new album does little to upset their pulse-regulated tempos and hushed-voice intimations.</p>
<p>As on the preceding <i>Transparent Things</i> and <i>Lighbulbs</i>, consumption and materialism comprise the thematic grist of <i>Ventriloquizzing</i>. But Fujiya &amp; Miyagi are self-aware enough to acknowledge that their music is essentially just another lifestyle accoutrement-- in the spirit of Kraftwerk's ""Showroom Dummies"" and Air's ""Electronic Performers"", the opening title track sees F&amp;M likening themselves to puppets, emotionally empty and easily manipulated. Ironically, this admission of their own synthetic quality marks one of the few occasions when <i>Ventriloquizzing</i> really catches fire, as the song's ping-pong bass line yields to a powerful burst of analog-synth drones. But for all the premium they place on motion and rhythm, Fujiya &amp; Miyagi songs rarely take you very far away from where they begin; whether employing a live drummer or an 808, the grooves are locked in early, with only minor textural tweaks (e.g., the invigorating Suicide-style organ fuzz on ""Yoyo"" and ""Tinsel &amp; Glitter""; the haunting choral vocals of ""Universe"") to subtly increase the intensity.</p>
<p>As a result, <i>Ventriloquizzing</i> places undue emphasis on David Best's sing-spiel to move the action along. While he does have a flair for understated satire-- the piano-rolled ""Taiwanese Boots"" cheekily itemizes food choices as a measure of status, while ""Minestrone"" updates an old parable about the devil positing the titular soup as the ultimate temptation-- Best tends to confuse repetition with profundity. It's no secret Fujiya &amp; Miyagi aren't Japanese, but Best's lyrics often sound cribbed from a beginner's guidebook to common English phrases (""you don't know which side your bread is buttered on,"" ""you go up and go down like a yo-yo""), and his sinister, admonishing delivery doesn't invest them with any more weight or meaning. Over the ""Yoo Doo Right"" bass pulse of the closing ""Universe"", Best repeats over and over again: ""You love to hear the sound of your own voice."" On an album that takes glee in skewering the chattering classes, at least Best is self-effacing enough to save the last shot for himself.</p></div>"|15013.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15013-ventriloquizzing/|6.3|Stuart Berman

He operates Tiny Telephone Studio, so if he wants to take his time making a record, he certainly can. All of his albums to date have been meticulously assembled things, full of carefully layered sounds, tweaked and prodded into shape over months. I guess everybody needs a change of pace now and then, because <i>White Wilderness</i> was recorded in three days with a live band, outside of Tiny Telephone. The live band in question is something called the Magik*Magik Orchestra, led by Minna Choi. They're not strictly a chamber orchestra in the sense you might expect. Yes, Choi has arranged these songs with strings and woodwinds, but the orchestra members also contribute things like piano, drums, and pedal steel.</p>
<p>So he got out of the studio and stretched his legs a little with a small orchestra. What kind of record does that make? Well, take away the tinkering and you get a record that still fits quite comfortably into Vanderslice's discography-- it's not that different, stylistically, from anything else he's done. The meticulous studio layering missing here is largely covered up by the orchestration. If there's any significant difference, it's in Vanderslice himself. His voice sounds much more vulnerable and fragile in this setting. I think back in particular to 2009's <i>Romanian Names</i>, where he seemed to be growing more comfortable with building himself into a small choir and was really putting his vocals out front; here, he recedes into the band a bit more, occasionally bolstered by a harmony from Choi or a few fluttering ""ah ahs"" from some of the orchestra.</p>
<p>He gets some of those ""ahs"" on ""The Piano Lesson"", a song literally about learning to play piano that Choi uses as an orchestral playground. Vanderslice's wandering vocal melody is anchored by an ominous sax figure, the strings play racing pizzicato patterns, brass and flutes swell queasily, and the overall effect is strikingly dark. There's a subtle tension at play on the album, almost a tug of war between Vanderslice and Choi, and one or the other typically winds up dominating each song, but there are a few where they strike a real balance. Up-tempo standout ""Overcoat"" is one of those songs. Vanderslice isn't so much a verse/chorus songwriter, but he can craft a memorable melody, and this one is great. It keeps the moaning woodwinds and shivering strings at bay until the second half of the song, when the complexity of the arrangement increases, leaving him to carefully pick his way through shards of orchestration.</p>
<p>One thing that working with an orchestra didn't disrupt is Vanderslice's commitment to concision. It must have been tempting to make something sprawling and try to live up to the orchestral scope of the project, but <i>White Wilderness</i> is just over a half hour long, like most of Vanderslice's albums. This has always served him well-- none of his records wear out their welcome. Neither does this one, but I do get the feeling there's a reason he usually spends so much time agonizing over his records-- all that tweaking really brings out the details of his songwriting, which are sometimes lost in the orchestration and less polished vocals here. Still, these types of projects can help a songwriter refocus and between them Vanderslice and Choi have made a memorable album that successfully adds a new twist to Vanderslice's catalog.</p></div>"|14951.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14951-white-wilderness/|7.2|Joe Tangari

The performance clip was taped in 1958 for L.A. TV show  ""Town Hall Party"" and finds Jackson roaring through an Elvis Presley hit  single called ""Hard Headed Woman"". As written, the song doesn't portray  women in the strongest light-- ""a hard-headed woman is the thorn in the  side of a man,"" goes the 50s-macho hook. But Jackson flips it-- and  gives the thing a good hard jolt, too. When she sings the  chorus, she adds a blustery ""you betcha, yeah!"" While many young women  of her time were content to pine after Elvis, she <i>dated</i> him while in her  teens and symbolically kicked his ass with his own song. But the most  startling and awesome thing about the ""Hard Headed Woman"" clip may be  Jackson's badass introduction: ""We think this is one of the  most beautiful love songs that's ever been written."" Kathleen Hanna  would most certainly approve.</p>
<p>Jackson's 50s sides would justly earn her the title of ""Queen of Rockabilly,"" and <i>The Party Ain't Over</i> is a reference to her 1958 hit ""Let's Have a Party"". But, since that  early success, the singer recorded many albums of more traditional  country, blues, and gospel over the last 50 years. And while her voice  was so galvanizing on those early singles-- her signature  growl could match any man's-- it would later prove to be tender,  lonesome, and gorgeous without a hint of the toughness that originally  made her famous. Delving into her catalog now, some of her most lasting  music may not be as revolutionary as her gender-busting rockabilly, but  it's also less novel; her classy 1964 LP <i>Blues in My Heart</i> in particular is a timeless work, both loose and graceful. But, with <i>The Party Ain't Over</i>,  Jack White aims to reconnect the 73-year-old Jackson with her teenage  style by any means necessary. So we get truckloads of overzealous horns  that sound ripped off from his buddy Conan's late-night band, White's  own fuzzed-out guitar, bustling drums, and cartoon-y slide work. The wild excess often ends up shoving Jackson to the sidelines on her own album.</p>
<p>The last time White worked  with one of his grandmotherly female idols was on Loretta Lynn's  devastatingly personal and loving <i>Van Lear Rose</i>. But there are  differences between that project and this one. <i>Van Lear Rose</i> had Lynn  writing most of the songs, and White treated them with reverence while  maintaining an airy live feel. Jackson didn't write any songs on <i>The Party Ain't Over</i>, which isn't terribly notable in itself considering she hailed from a pre-singer-songwriter  era and wrote few of her own tunes. But the songs on the record--  mostly picked by White-- often come off as forced, unfairly  anachronistic or both. When the too-loud trumpets and juke-joint piano  push Jackson on opener ""Rip It Up"", it feels a little uncomfortable. It's  almost the same uneasy vibe you get when watching that <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ze72uyZfY5Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fake old guy  dancing up a storm in those Six Flags commercials</a>-- something just ain't  right there.</p>
<p>Of course, White's intentions are good here, and  chances are many people (including myself) wouldn't even be paying attention if he weren't involved. And if the point was to get folks  to revisit this legendary singer's legacy and grant her much-overdue appreciation, mission accomplished. But White doesn't help Jackson make any  new classics on <i>The Party Ain't Over</i>. Annoyingly, the last track suggests it didn't have to be that way. ""Blue Yodel #6"" ditches all the instrumental flotsam as it  finds Jackson singing against only White's twanging acoustic guitar. The  singer's weathered-yet-vibrant voice and personality finally don't  have to battle for the spotlight. It's quite easily the best thing here, as it hearkens back to her post-rockabilly 60s records and shows this undervalued pioneer doesn't need to party to have a good time.</p></div>"|15042.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15042-the-party-aint-over/|5.2|Ryan Dombal

The music is about vibe and feel, after all, so it has to be tempting to ditch the songs altogether and dive all the way into atmosphere. But while there's a lot of music in this vein being made, much of it seems interchangeable. So it's natural to approach <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/29364-geotic/"" target=""_blank"">Geotic</a>, a side project of Will Wiesenfeld from <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/28739-baths/"" target=""_blank"">Baths</a>, with a certain amount of skepticism. But there's more going on here than just a break from songwriting.</p>
<p><i>Mend</i> is Wiesenfeld's fifth album as Geotic, a project he's been returning to since 2008. There are a few non-musical elements that might make it seem tossed-off-- its unveiling via an <a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/indie/postfoetus/geotic.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Angelfire page</a>, the fact that it was recorded in four days total, just after this past Christmas. But the record itself is more than just half-formed ephemera. Most of <i>Mend</i> was recorded on electric guitar, an instrument that didn't feature heavily on Baths' breakout debut LP, last year's <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14433-cerulean/"" target=""_blank""><i>Cerulean</i></a>. Wiesenfeld's  recent <a href=""http://www.daytrotter.com/dt/baths-concert/20040404-37382398.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Daytrotter session</a> demonstrated his skill on piano and his ear for deconstructing his own material, and <i>Mend</i> offers further revelations in the form of his guitar playing. Throughout, gently picked patterns skip across webs of static tone, all of which is swathed in amniotic fuzz. There's a bit of sleepiness here and there, particularly on the loping ""Beaming Husband"", but this is otherwise quite physical music for an ambient album. You can hear the bent notes and fingers sliding along the fretboard on opener ""Unwind"", and there is real movement on the lightly galloping highlight ""And Upon Awakening"". <i>Mend</i> ultimately feels organic and human, more about people than machines.</p>
<p>Which makes sense, since the bloops and warped samples of <i>Cerulean</i> were always in service of exploring emotion (the guy titled a song ""â¥""). A quick scan through <i>Mend</i>'s tracklist (""Find Your Peace"", ""Sleep and We'll Transition"", ""I'll Have Come and Gone With You"") reveals that those preoccupations are still very much present. There are no lofty themes or overwrought sentiments here, though. Instead, <i>Mend</i>'s melodies are gently simple, carrying enough heft to stick to your brain without becoming syrupy. For most bedroom artists, that'd be a triumph; for Wiesenfeld, it's something he did over the holidays, another bend in an increasingly compelling career path.</p></div>"|15037.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15037-mend/|7.4|Larry Fitzmaurice

Presented as a ""mix"" rather than a series of tracks-- unlike most electronic artists, Eleven Tigers opts to begin his career with an LP instead of a single-- <i>Clouds Are Mountains</i> nestles intriguing slabs of techno into listless atmospheres.</p>
<p>Eleven Tigers first made noise in the middle of last year with the single ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12003-stableface/"">Stableface</a>"", an insistent and prolonged beat drama on an album filled with vignettes, which excited dubstep fans and received several remixes. It's ironic that an album specifically constructed to be heard as a piece will be defined by its strongest single, one that is ineffectively buried near the end of the album. <i>Clouds Are Mountains</i> doesn't feel like a mix because Eleven Tigers too often mistakes drift for transition. The exciting moments feel like a group of islands amidst an electronic sea.  Mixes tend to build toward an emotional or musical release; <i>Clouds Are Mountains</i> ebbs and flows and feels merely like a particularly cohesive album.</p>
<p>In terms of both spirit and execution, Eleven Tigers recalls Burial, but only in part because each plays dubstep: Eleven Tigers relies chiefly on distorted, alien voices and pigeon-footed rhythms for its important moments. It's also unrepentantly moody, like a child prodded too many times about just what is the matter and who keeps answering, ""nothing."" My favorite moments on <i>Clouds Are Mountains</i> almost invariably exist outside those contexts, like the drum'n'bass-indebted middle section of ""Thesis"" and ""Frozen Wheel"".  Or when the folk/bass/pop clash during ""Songs for You"" brings to mind the underloved British act Various Production. Moments of ambience and proper reggae are sadly less evocative.</p>
<p><i>Clouds Are Mountains</i> can't sit still. It sprints between styles and tempos in a way that feels indecisive, especially for a work that stresses its cohesion. Eleven Tigers puts his hands on a lot of styles here, but the only thing he seems to take ownership of is the album's dour demeanor. That kind of monotonous mood can benefit an album of outstanding focus or singular style, but Eleven Tigers too often feels like he's trying to out-execute his peers.</p></div>"|15045.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15045-clouds-are-mountains/|5.7|Andrew Gaerig

That's an admirable goal, and so far they've mostly stuck with it. They've spent most of their career as a fast-and-bulbous hybrid of a super-heavy, experimentation-minded art-rock band and a sweet little pop group, equal parts chirp and pummel. In the six-album-plus run from 2002's <i>Reveille</i> to 2008's <i>Offend Maggie</i>, they perpetually pushed the sound of the band into fresh if occasionally awkward territory.</p>
<p>They're also a totally idiomatic band, one of those groups where you usually only need to hear a few seconds' worth of any song to know it's them, whether or not bassist Satomi Matsuzaki is singing at the time. That puts Deerhoof in a difficult position: Their identity is built around all four members' particular quirks as musicians, but they're struggling not to repeat themselves, so they're hunting for new rooms within the house they have constructed for themselves.</p>
<p>It's been more than two years since <i>Offend Maggie</i>-- an unusually long stretch by their standards-- but <i>Deerhoof vs. Evil</i> is less a leap forward than a transitional record, along the lines of 2005's <i>Green Cosmos</i> EP. They're sticking to their M.O. of repeating a single odd musical or lyrical phrase (""I did crimes for you, they're coming true!"") again and again until it sounds like a hook; beyond that, you can tell that they're trying to wriggle out of what they've been doing in the band's previous phase, but haven't quite figured out what comes next.</p>
<p>In particular, they keep sidling up to the kind of heavy rock that's been their secret weapon in the past, then bolting away from it. Deerhoof have always had a difficult relationship with great big stomps and riffs, but in the past their clever self-sabotage has often let a cracked-but-intact rock song sneak through-- <i>Friend Opportunity's</i> ""+81"", <i>Apple O'</i>'s ""Dummy Discards a Heart"", <i>Offend Maggie</i>'s ""The Tears and Music of Love"".</p>
<p>There's nothing anywhere near as direct as those songs here. Instead, we get the likes of ""The Merry Barracks"": A handful of rhythmically lopsided loops that eventually synch up with Saunier murmuring ""Hello hello hello/ Atomic bombs are going to explode,"" then a passage where Matsuzaki's clear-voiced, unemphatic simper alternates with the band going WHAM WHAM WHAM, 15 seconds of the whole group doing their best imitation of '92 shoegaze, a free-noise guitar solo, and so on. It's also the first of two different songs that include the line ""everyone, everyone, sing!"" (The Saunier-sung closer, ""Almost Everyone, Almost Always"", begins with a variation: ""Everyone, everyone, in a bow tie."")</p>
<p>What keeps Deerhoof entertaining even at their most distracted is that they actually mean that ""everyone sing"" bit: they're as open-hearted and goofy as egghead experimentalists get. ""No One Asked to Dance"", one of the prettiest songs they've ever recorded, could be incidental music from a late-60s European art movie; ""Let's Dance the Jet"" actually is a cover of a Mikis Theodorakis piece from a 1967 film, <i>The Day the Fish Came Out</i>-- a drone-plus-freaky-rhythm instrumental that's a welcome reminder that Deerhoof didn't invent this stuff.</p>
<p>Saunier indicated in a <a href=""http://www.popnography.com/2011/01/catching-up-with-deerhoof.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent Popnography interview</a> that all four members of Deerhoof individually write songs, which the other members then alter until everyone's satisfied with them. Sometimes that works out nicely: ""Must Fight Current"", a duet between Matsuzaki and guitarist John Dieterich, adopts the old Sleater-Kinney effect of two different songs that just happen to work when they're superimposed, then dials it down to a prickly, dissonant samba. Often, though, what's left of these songs is too much or too little.

They approach classic melody in miniature, chipping nuggets off of <i>Nuggets</i>, and they never go far without an inviting little hook. But they don't let those hooks last long either. Their songs are spare and distant, reveling in negative space and moving with a deliberate, lopsided gait. This sonic personality is best encapsulated in Mike Donovan's singing, which is awkward and endearing. It sounds like he loves hooks but doesn't want to chase them, meditating on melodies rather than working himself up enough to hit the ""right"" notes.</p>
<p>All of which is why, despite the fact that they've ripped out some pretty great singles, Sic Alps make music that's best absorbed on full-length albums. As their odd tics, off notes, and bevy of stops and starts build up, the logic of their approach becomes clearer and more addictive. In that sense <i>Napa Asylum</i>, with 22 songs stretched over 45 minutes, is probably the best Sic Alps full-length so far. Two-chord ditties bump up against noisy distortion, quiet sketches draw out multi-voice harmonies, short lyrics snake through twangy jaunts. And it's all presented in a style that's less lo-fi than old-fi, as if Sic Alps were huddled around a single beat-up mic in a dusty 1950's studio.</p>
<p>The result is creativity doled out in rangy bursts. Take a three-strong stretch about halfway through <i>Napa Asylum</i>-- the slow, distorted, Royal Trux-like ""Trip Train"" slips into the bouncy, Beatles-esque ""Ball of Fame"", then into the sparse ""Ranger"", which mines tons of mood from basically two notes. Because they're all drenched in the trademark Sic Alps atmosphere-- never rushed, over-polished, or abrupt-- these stylistic shifts sound natural and uncontrived.</p>
<p>In fact, <i>Napa Asylum </i>is so rich, its peaks can be easy to miss. One particular highlight deserves isolation-- on ""The First White Man to Touch California Soil"", Donovan portrays California with what could be a celebration of his band's own outlook. ""Now we're in this country living free/ And we got that same mentality/ How the Colorado used to flow/ Now your neighbor's greener grasses grow."" It's the album's biggest, boldest track, buttressed by new member Noel Von Harmonson, bringing his knack for noise over from Comets on Fire. It's easy to imagine the other 21 songs here<i> </i>being that fleshed out, with instruments and textures added and verses and choruses repeated more than a few times. Sic Alps could probably do that version of themselves well, but their essential shaggy-dog personality might get obscured by so much activity. On <i>Napa Asylum </i>they've wisely stuck to their patient, understated approach-- and pretty much perfected it.</p></div>"|14995.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14995-napa-asylum/|8.0|Marc Masters

The Texas-born Premier perfected and codified a distinctly New York form of beatmaking, a crisp crackle that gained much of its power through tiny ruptures in its own infinite repetition. Premier's preferred tools were and are simple: a tooth-rattle snare, a perfectly-timed needle-slice, an unidentifiable and cannily selected shard of someone else's record. But he blurred all these things together with the grace and precision of a true artist. And like a great film director, he knew just when to disappear, ceding the spotlight to the rappers' voices on his tracks. When Premier's longtime Gang Starr partner Guru died last year, many of the tributes took care to dance around Guru's greatest strength as a rapper: With his unflappable monotone, he made a great foil to Premier's alchemy. It was never the other way around.</p>
<p>But here's the thing about living legends: They continue to live and, in most cases, to work. And in all but a handful of cases, their late-in-life work just serves to remind you how great they were when they were young and hungry and had the world's collective ear. That's absolutely the case with late-period Preemo, who's content to crank out bare-bones headknocks for craggy old N.Y. buddies and asskissy tribute-payers. Superstar former collaborators like Jay-Z aren't exactly knocking down his door for beats anymore, and Preemo's own rudimentary stylistic tics have come to largely overwhelm the indefinable vision he once applied to them. That's what's going on in <i>Get Used to Us</i>, a compilation that exists to highlight the roster of Preemo's new imprint Year Round Records. It's an hour of new DJ Premier beats, a happy occasion even at this late date. But the lack of star-power on that roster just glares. As an instrumental album, this would probably be pretty boring, but it wouldn't be more boring than what we got.</p>
<p>The best moments on <i>Get Used to Us</i> all come from old Premier buddies, grizzled and semi-anonymous hardheads like Blaq Poet and NYGz, whose voices have the sort of lived-in rasp that these tracks demand. On ""Rappin Exercise"", NYGz member Panchi adapts a loping singsong, which makes him the only guy on the whole album to have any fun with his delivery. The worst come from unctuous starstruck open-mic-night herb Nick Javas, whose syntax is truly tortured and who can't stop letting us know how honored he is to be on a Premier track. ""Opportunity Knoccs"", his first showcase, is a skit blown out to song length, and it actually derives its beat from Javas knocking on Premier's studio door to beg for an audition. (The second Javas track, ""Not a Game"", is made up entirely of clumsy sports metaphors, since every song obviously has to have some halfassed unifying concept.) Another relative newcomer is Young Maylay, best known as the voice of lead character CJ in <i>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</i>. He's an OK rapper, but once you hear the CJ in his voice, you can't unhear it; it causes an immediate sense-memory flashback to all those times you accidentally drove into the fucking ocean again.</p>
<p>The biggest names on the album are guys like KRS-One and MC Eiht, people who peaked 15 or 20 years ago and who have audibly deteriorated in the years since. Eiht is a particular disappointment. The Compton's Most Wanted veteran is supposedly working on a full-length with Premier, an exciting idea until you hear the tracks that actually come out of it. Eiht thrives over slow-crawling cinematic beats, and you'd think Premier would put a dip in his usual boom-bap to accommodate the man. But he doesn't, and Eiht sounds lost. As recently as the last decade, Premier was capable of smooth left-turns like Devin the Dude's ""Doobie Ashtray"" or Cee-Lo's ""Evening News"". But <i>Get Used to Us</i> shows a brilliant mind trapped in his own wheelhouse, unwilling or unable to do anything but crank out lesser versions of the sound that built his legend.</p></div>"|15023.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15023-dj-premier-presents-year-round-records-get-used-to-us/|5.5|Tom Breihan

She's stepped up a notch or two since, inking a deal with indie-rock behemoths Jagjaguwar and recruiting Justin Vernon to provide a guest vocal turn on this album's second track, ""Daphne"". There's also a more pliable approach this time around, with Ices subtly contorting her core sound, taciturn balladry, to fold in meatier bursts of guitar and percussion. The key asset on <i>Grown Unknown</i> is her impressively supple voice, which can spiral up into a giddy falsetto and fall crashing to the floor in dolorous rumination within a heartbeat-- although it's occasionally hampered by the uneven backing that Ices latches onto her vocal hankering.</p>
<p>The salient difference between this album and the last is bound up in that vocal zigzagging, which sounds less stiff and more relaxed than before, with Ices mostly eschewing the Tori Amos/Joanna Newsom territory of her earlier recordings for a distinct tone of her own. The instrumentation ticks over at a funeral-paced cadence throughout, but <i>Grown Unknown</i> never settles into a distinct pattern otherwise, often making great stylistic leaps within single songs.</p>
<p>When Ices indulges her avant leanings, the material provides a more suitable foil for her voice. A mixture of finger snaps, glinting piano, and subdued organ provides a suitably artful backbone over which she hangs a touchingly forlorn vocal turn on ""Little Marriage"", and there's a deft marrying of chamber music sadness and welts of distorted guitar on ""Bag of Wind"". But it's the standout title track that provides the most successful conduit for Ices' eclectic whims, with a militaristic handclap and acoustic picking alongside feather-light string parts. Here Ices sounds relaxed, locating a natural meeting point for her disparate sounds and easing into a vocal that effortlessly intertwines with the arrangement.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the album continues in its asymmetrical way, rarely gelling as a whole but intermittently spilling over with intriguing embellishments. A few tracks strain under the weight of their own influences-- ""After Is Always Before"" could be a female-fronted Grizzly Bear circa <i>Yellow House</i>, while ""Ice Wine"" veers closely to a Cat Power vocal performance. ""Lilac"" heralds a possible way forward, beginning with the kind of deathly muted backing reminiscent of Mark Hollis' lone solo venture outside of Talk Talk, then emerging into the half-light with a slow-burn patter of drums. That kind of less-is-more approach, where all the clutter is shaved down to a paper-thin framework, is where Ices produces her most affecting material, potentially sketching out a new strain of inspiration for her to follow next time out.</p></div>"|15001.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15001-grown-unknown/|7.2|Nick Neyland

Donations are encouraged, but not required. There is no record label advance funding the project. A friendly-looking smiley-faced ying-yang symbol sits to the side of the screen, surrounded by the words, ""Be cool. You make it worth our while."" It's one thing to throw fortune to the digital winds if you're a well-established arena-rocking band like, say, Radiohead. For Celebration-- who have a much more modest following-- financial and business incentives are less obvious. But listening to the completed <i>Hello Paradise</i>, the creative payoff is clear.</p>
<p>They tried it the traditional way first. Celebration released two albums-- 2005's <i>Celebration</i> and 2007's <i>The Modern Tribe</i>-- on major-indie 4AD. But four years of grinding tours, press cycles, and sales expectations withered Celebration's zeal. ""They offered a contract re-negotiation and we declined,"" frontwoman Katrina Ford <a href=""http://rockinthestove.com/2010/12/12/katrina-ford-of-celebration-recording-touring-cooking-on-the-road-2/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">told the website Rockin' the Stove</a> last December, explaining the band's decision to leave label's roster. ""For us, in the end, the benefits did not outweigh the cost. The whole business bummed me out."" Stepping off of the music biz treadmill-- and giving up the exposure it  promises-- gave Celebration the space to become a better band, distribute their music on their own, and to take their time doing it.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, <i>Hello Paradise </i>is Celebration's most laid-back work to date. Songs unfurl at a measured pace, riding head-bobbing rhythms and bluesy riffs through a low psychedelic haze. Their last record, <i>The Modern Tribe,</i> was soaked in trippy textures. Producer Dave Sitek (TV on the Radio)-- brought forth headshop vibes by the bucketful. In every empty nook and cranny, a set of wind chimes tinkled. As a result Celebration-- a herky-jerky and energetic live band-- came off flat and one-dimensional.</p>
<p>Largely recorded and produced by the band itself, <i>Hello Paradise</i> dials in the sonic soup at the right time, rather than all the time. ""Battles"" uses a sparse intro to springboard into explosive, Zeppelin-worthy, Eastern-tinged riffage. ""Shelter"" builds from a stripped-down ballad into a wave of cheapo-synth-string romance. The anxious pummeling of the group's self-titled debut is long gone. Organist/guitarist Sean Antanaitis and drummer David Bergander play looser but more methodically, throwing themselves fully into the record's reverb-drenched crescendos.</p>
<p>But Ford makes the greatest breakthrough on <i>Hello Paradise</i>. Ten years ago, fronting Love Life-- her former band with Antanaitis-- she was a brutish stage presence, dressed in giant black boots, grunting like a linebacker with a zeal for Nick Cave. On <i>Hello Paradise</i> Ford is, undeniably, a singer-- pushing the music forward, using melodic embellishments to amp up the drama. On ""Junky"" she howls and warps words into strange shapes. But she's also gained confidence at conveying tender, guarded emotions. Ford can be forceful and delicate, frequently within the space of the same song.</p>
<p>And it doesn't hurt that she sounds more defiant. ""I won't lay down and I won't play this harp anymore/ Odds are stacked/ Some love can bring you back/ If you choose,"" sings Ford on ""I Will Not Fall"". With little hope of prolonging their career through traditional means, Celebration had nobody but themselves to please with <i>Hello Paradise</i>. And, somehow, that seems to have set the bar higher.</p></div>"|15038.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15038-hello-paradise/|7.4|Aaron Leitko

I know that as far as conscious-skewing MCs go, Talib Kweli's had his share of detractors-- mostly people who consider him too reliant on pop-culture metaphors or just plain don't like his voice-- but he's never managed to stumble his way into alienating the audience he already has. And while he hasn't always been quite as breathlessly venerated as peers like Common or Mos Def, he's also never dropped a <i>Universal Mind Control </i>or a <i>True Magic</i>, a fanbase-disillusioning pratfall that lacks everything the faithful like about him. (At least, not too prominently-- his one big detour, the electro-damaged pastel-stripe-rap side project Idle Warship, got one of those quietly promoted free-download releases in 2009, the equivalent of a big-budget action movie released in mid-January.) If that means Talib Kweli has spent his solo career playing it safe, it also means he's as close as there is to a sure bet in indie rap: He's even less likely to disappoint fans than he is to shake up their preconceptions.</p>
<p>His latest release, <i>Gutter Rainbows</i>, is one of those artistically self-sufficient, post-Internet records that's been created, assembled, and channeled through means completely independent of the mainstream record industry, and yet it doesn't demonstrate a drastic change in Kweli's style at all. That probably says more about the relative freedom Kweli's had throughout his career than anything; when a solitary (and actually pretty good) will.i.am beat on <i>Eardrum </i>is the closest he's ever come to quote-unquote selling out, creative control has never really seemed like an issue. And while there's an album in the works that Kweli has claimed will be a major departure from his usual lyrical persona-- the tellingly titled <i>Prisoner of Consciousness</i>--Â <i>Gutter Rainbows </i>doesn't sound like a jaded effort from an artist who's dissatisfied with his normal routine.</p>
<p>In short, it's familiar without feeling rote. Kweli still takes criminal entrepreneurs and gun-clap talk to task with flippant punchline dismissals on the where-I'm-from title track, still holds fast to his roots with a humble gratitude on ""Friends &amp; Family"", and still consistently makes being scholarly sound like a good way to throw your weight around. His learned, nice-guy approach can switch over into good-natured ego-tripping when he wants to, but it doesn't eclipse the sentimentality at his core. Sure,Â KweliÂ brags about racking up frequent-flyer miles in Virgin Atlantic first class (""Mr. International""), but it's only so he can go overseas to connect with fans across the world. And even when he big-ups himself for his cocksmanship (""Ain't Waiting""), he can't help but put it in fairy-tale romantic terms that invoke <i>Peter Pan </i>and <i>The Princess Bride</i>. Yeah, I know-- at least it's not in hashtag form.</p>
<p>And besides, everyone who hasn't been put off by Kweli's brushes with cue-the-rimshot corniness by now should recognize that he's had one of the more impressive lyrical-rapper flows going. If his metaphor/simile lyrics can be a mixed bag, the way he unfolds them against the backing tracks-- throwing his bars off-kilter, switching from casually conversational to elaborately virtuosic, and tweaking his emphases mid-line-- is worth hearing just for the way he plays both with and against the rhythm, a soloist where other voices are content to just riff.</p>
<p>The beats on <i>Gutter Rainbows </i>are tight-enough neo-soul by committee-- 13 producers handle 14 tracks -- and most of it sounds like faintly modernized versions of Rawkus-circa-2002 boom-bap, with the occasional outlier in the form of a post-""Hello Brooklyn"" old-school banger (Khrysis' ""I'm on One"") or atmospheric synthesizer dirge (Blaq Toven's ""How You Love Me""). But isolating the beats from the rapper seems futile; this is Kweli's most comfortable turf, and he clicks with it as an MC who works like an ensemble cast member. When it hits on all cylinders-- the Ski Beatz-produced gospel-soul piano avalanche of ""Cold Rain"" being the best of several highlights-- it's hard to blame him for sticking to what he knows.</p></div>"|15007.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15007-gutter-rainbows/|7.4|Nate Patrin

But rather than undermine Gang of Four's ideological integrity, the recent use of the song quoted above (""Natural's Not in It"") in a Microsoft gaming-console commercial marked a logical extension of it. Despite their Maoist fascinations and anger-is-an-energy fervor, Gang of Four were always less interested in smashing storefronts than in exploring the anxiety of consumerism-- how a culture obsessed with status and acquisition reduces personal interaction to a transactional experience. And they did so not out of scorn for those who fuel the capitalist machine, but to acknowledge their own complicity in it.</p>
<p>So the seeming contradiction of Gang of Four hocking video games in 2011 is actually the perfect preamble to the unease and self-doubt expressed throughout <i>Content</i>, the very title of which alludes to the process by which creativity is depersonalized into commodity. <i>Content</i> is the group's first album of new material since the <i>Entertainment!</i>-era band reunited in 2004 at the height of the post-millennial post-punk uprising, and used the occasion to re-record their classic songs (on 2005 release <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3390-return-the-gift/"" target=""_blank""><i>Return the Gift</i></a>) as a strategy of diverting royalties away from their former label EMI.  But even with founding bassist Dave Allen and drummer Hugo Burnham stepping aside in recent years (replaced by Thomas McNeice and Mark Heaney, respectively), Gang of Four have ironically remained more active than many of the post-punk progeny (the Rapture, Radio 4, Bloc Party) who brought them back into vogue.</p>
<p>If Gang of Four's 2005 reformation proved they could more than hold their own against the upstarts, then <i>Content</i> shows that their chief concerns-- the financial and psychological toll of keeping up with the Joneses-- resonate all the more loudly in an Internet-accelerated era where even those on the vanguard can feel behind the times, and where the lawless, anonymous nature of online exchange threatens to overwhelm our identities. It's thus fitting that the album's most exuberant moment-- the muscular Motown stomp ""Who Am I?""-- is used to soundtrack a modern-day anarchist's existential crisis: ""You can't steal when everything is free.""</p>
<p>After spending the past few years performing only songs from the band's original 1979-82 catalog, it's no surprise the new iteration of Gang of Four comes much closer to capturing that scabrous spirit-- mostly thanks to Andy Gill's still-potent guitar spasms-- than any other Go4 effort without Allen or Burnham (1983's <i>Hard</i>, 1991's <i>Mall</i>, 1995's <i>Shrinkwrapped</i>). ""You Don't Have to Be Mad"" is essentially an aged update of ""Natural's Not in It"", complete with a similar desperately-seeking-leisure theme and a mid-song breakdown where the rhythm section drops out and King and Gill engage in call-and-response warfare; ""I Party All the Time"" strips ""I Love a Man in Uniform"" of its <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLnIf0JjszY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">80s production gloss</a> but keeps the female back-up singers and sardonic humor.</p>
<p>But the band that brought the funk to punk isn't in much of a dancing mood here. Where the early Gang of Four were defined by the oppositional tension between Gill's messy bent-string squiggles and the air-tight, authoritative rhythm section, McNeice and Heaney play a mostly subservient role to Gill, matching the guitarist's Morse-code communiquÃ©s with clipped, off-kilter accents. As such, there's a pervading feel of restraint to the album-- especially compared to the ferocity on display during those 2005-2006 tours. It's as if the defeatism running through King's lyric sheet has infected the performances, while the vocoderized spoken-word set piece ""It Was Never Gonna Turn Out Too Good"" threatens to completely kill the momentum on album that only sporadically accrues it. King and Gill's spirited interplay and their obvious commitment to the Gang of Four cause keep <i>Content</i> from becoming the assembly-line product its title signifies, but for all its jagged edges, <i>Content</i> too rarely goes for the jugular.</p></div>"|15032.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15032-content/|6.8|Stuart Berman

After the success of their ubiquitous first big single ""Hang Me Up to Dry"" five years ago, it wasn't long before they had been lumped in with indie mainstays like the Black Keys. Perhaps buoyed by Black Keys' deserved success,Â <i>Mine Is Yours</i> finds Cold War Kids aiming for a decidedly more arena-friendly style, going so far as to enlist the help of Jacquire King, the producer who helped push fellow cheese-merchants Kings of Leon in a similar direction over the course of their previous two breakthrough records.</p>
<p>So, good for them, Cold War Kids are clearly making a bid for that kind of mainstream acceptance here, infusing their wishy-washy, blue-lit sound with a schmaltzy bigness that matches the heft of the religious and romantic in their music. More streamlined than their older music,Â <i>Mine Is Yours</i>' relative simplicity allows its songs to more transparently deal with love lost and found. Alas, the presentation couldn't be any more comically bombastic and melodramatic, and the idea of these guys splitting a bill with Coldplay or Kings of Leon would still seem like a bit of reach; maybe Train.</p>
<p>Most of the material here can be pretty easily tied-in with the goofy, love-and-life-affirming modern rock radio staples that share more with the likes of James Blunt or Lifehouse than the indie heavy-hitters they once found themselves awkwardly rubbing shoulders with. Even though songs like ""Finally Begin"" and ""Louder Than Ever"" are likely to inspire generic, arms-wide-open sing-alongs, Cold War Kids still find themselves trying to conjure the spirits of their former would-be contemporaries. ""Sensitive Kid"" amateurishly toys with Spoon's fractured stabs of piano, electronic percussion, and obtuse grooves; ""Out of the Wilderness"" attempts to replicate the majestic epicness of<i> Funeral</i>-era Arcade Fire, but instead lurches about uncomfortably like a tangled marionette.</p>
<p>One important thing to note is that Cold War Kids certainly haven't made a boring record. Where their previous two just sort of poked about, <i>Mine Is Yours</i> thrives on mishandled, overwrought emotional extremes. ""Skip the Charades"" confidently runs with a metaphor so face-palmingly silly, you'll be able to forgive just about anything. And even though frontman Nathan Willett has clearly taken strides to even out his voice, he's adopted an unlikable, smirky croon, made even more painfully noticeable when he's spouting out gems like, ""It's a slippery slope, like that Mouse Trap game"".</p>
<p>Only on ""Cold Toes on the Cold Floor"" can we recant the ragtag jubilation of something like ""Hang Me Up to Dry"", but it too is a false alarm. Trying to impart a little spontaneity into an otherwise coldly calculated effort, Willett calls for ""One more!"" round of the chorus.

A consummate refusenik, Thirlwell chafed against the one scene, industrial, that would have him as a member. Thirty years later, with <i>Hide</i>, Thirlwell's music is still impossible to place. Mixing astringent 21st-century composition with the nauseous beauty of psychedelia at its least smiley-faced, <i>Hide</i>'s got no real kin in the current indie ferment of stripped-down 1990s revivalism and sunny indie pop. But though <i>Hide</i> is less hideous and more sumptuous than the records which made Foetus' reputation, it remains a unpredictable, horrific, and beautiful mix.</p>
<p>Early Foetus records, like 1984's blackly hilarious <i>Hole</i>, shared the industrial bands' love for queasy electronic textures and clattering metallic percussion. But while he was equal friends and fellow travellers Einsturzende Neubauten in intensity and harshness, the furor of punk meets the ugly whine and scrape of broken power tools, Thirlwell was also something of a one-man studio genius. His records were never crude assaults; they were masterfully multi-layered artifacts put together with a perverted pop instinct for actual hooks. <i>Hide</i> is proof that Thirlwell's never lost that skill, that if anything his abilities as an arranger and producer have grown even more assured, but sonically it goes to some very different places.</p>
<p>The sound of <i>Hide</i> is ""classical music"" broken and rearranged and then pounded or finessed into songs by a very odd man: The <i>sturm-und-drang</i> of the composers who slaved on high Hollywood melodramas, snippets of opera warped by technology, outright gorgeous writing for piano and Stravinsky-ish strings, austere choral arrangements, and hideous brass fanfares. Again and again, Thirlwell flits between the tender and the terrifying, never letting you enjoy his ravishments for more than one track a time. Fragile melodies from a music box give way to stark musique concrÃ¨te misery that sounds like a duet between a struck oil drum and the squeaking of a birthday balloon. Like all the best psychedelic artists, Thirlwell wants to disorient you, just with twisted concert hall music instead of endless sloppy guitar fuzz freakouts.</p>
<p>Thirlwell certainly found common ground with the bleakness of industrial's worldview. But as a frontman, he had a sick, funny swagger that couldn't have been further from gaunt moaners of industrial's second and third tiers. There was plenty of glam seduction in his performances, but also the piss-taking charm of a standup comedian at a third-rate casino, telling obscenely off-color jokes about Hitler and Stalin. Much of that attitude and attack seems dampened on <i>Hide</i>, perhaps due to age or shifting priorities, but Thirlwell's restraint actually makes the music all the more uncomfortable. Again, it's a matter of unstable contrasts, Thirlwell's pained, pallid piano bar balladeering set against the Carl Stalling zaniness of <i>Hide</i>'s more operatic vocal work.</p>
<p>Listening to <i>Hide</i>, comparing it to the glut of forgettable improvised noise that currently claims to be inspired by old-school industrial, it's hard not to admire the perversity of someone lavishing this much care on such an unrepentantly ugly record in 2010. But <i>Hide</i> confirms, like all of Foetus's output so far, that careful craft, far from resulting in a too-polished end product, can be just another route to delirium.</p></div>"|15024.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15024-hide/|7.0|Jess Harvell

They basically play soft-rock-- not the stylish brand of Phoenix, the psychedelic kind of Gayngs, the hazy Washed Out type, or the sly and subtle version favored by Destroyer. No, this is the broad and eclectic sort of soft-rock that might fall under the tastefully patterned umbrella of ""adult-contemporary,"" a radio format mostly defined by what it isn't: punk, metal, hard rock, rap, and so on. It's played on rock-based instruments with a strong vocal presence, a keen ear for arrangement and texture, and a knack for homogenized exotica. Otherwise, it lacks defining characteristics, meaning an aura of rebellion or the dominant influence of any single subculture.</p>
<p>Molly Shea and Jason Klauber are the duo at the heart of Acrylics, though they expand to a quintet live. Grizzly Bear's Chris Taylor produced and released their 2009 EP, <i>All of the Fire</i>. They move to the Hot Sands label for debut LP <i>Lives and Treasure</i>, which showcases a sound malleable enough to assimilate new wave, country, lite-funk, art-pop, and more. ""Sparrow Song"" is an ingenuous ode to Kate Bush's spacey electronic pop. The chilly disco-rock of ""Nightwatch"" has a sultry, hooky vocal that recalls Suzanne Vega's ""Tom's Diner"". Shades of Sinead O'Connor, Fleetwood Mac, Natalie Merchant, and American Music Club loom large. But traces of modern big-tent indie can be found as well. ""The Window"", with its woolly vocals and webbed acoustic arpeggios, splits the difference between Bright Eyes and Elliot Smith, while ""Asian Pear"" develops from dreamy beginnings into a lean tremolo-guitar anthem with the barking grandeur of Wolf Parade.</p>
<p>Acrylics avoid fashionable chaos. Their interest is in getting a guitar's delay interval or flanger profile just right; in dropping the fill in the perfect spot. There are only a few mild solos, and more often, the guitar lays back as a glinting under-texture for big synths and voices. Shea is the better singer, with ironclad pitch and an interesting tang in her voice. Klauber's singing is a homelier mumble, though it grows on you. When their voices come together, things really click. The lyrics tend toward extremes, either abstrusely mystical (hers) or blurry and out-of-the-way (his). Shea flirts with something satirically new-agey at times, and between her soaring over the ""planets and skies and fields of a future time"" and Klauber's earthier ruminations, the emotional and conceptual centers feel vague.</p>
<p>The best songs-- ""Counting Sheep"", ""Molly's Vertigo"", and ""Asian Pear""-- feature strong structural definition and crisp, surprising dynamic shifts. A handful of genre-based set pieces fare less well, like the wordy, meandering folk of ""It's Cool Here"". Dylanesque isn't the right look for Acrylics, who are better at carefully pruned exteriors than core songs. But even here, there are striking details to admire: Eerily diminished chords and harmonies drift like alien breezes through the slow, sentimental tune. Lacking what we call ""edge"" or any hint of outsider pretension, <i>Lives and Treasure</i> is not, by and large, designed to stir great passions-- it's soothing, controlled, and slightly superficial. The exceptions-- ""Asian Pear"" is a song with something on the line-- reinforce the rule. While the taste level occasionally falters, this is a fine and detail-oriented album that should be taken with a grain of salt by fans for whom music must always, at some level, be a site of iconoclasm.</p></div>"|15008.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15008-lives-and-treasure/|6.9|Brian Howe

It's tempting to think that the hard work was done there-- Beam established a new approach and made a great album in the process-- but <i>Kiss Each Other Clean</i>, the full-band follow-up, is in some ways even more ambitious than its predecessor. He's reaching in a few new directions here, pushing himself hard as a singer, and taking risks, some of which pan out and a few of which don't.</p>
<p>Broadly, Beam at this point is writing by far the most assertive melodies of his career. Not the best, necessarily, but the boldest and most forcefully phrased. Even the song that most clearly ties back to <i>The Shepherd's Dog</i>, album centerpiece ""Rabbit Will Run"", has a melody that's quite different from anything he's done before. ""Rabbit Will Run"" is an easy highlight-- the arrangement is fantastically detailed, driven by a heavily layered rhythm track that bubbles with hypnotic thumb piano, and balanced by sections where the rhythm drops out, leaving Beam's voice hovering over a strange mix of sounds that might be a chopped-up pan flute arranged into a loop. The guitar sounds like an old-fashioned modem. It's a weirdly intoxicating mix that exemplifies the imagination Beam brings to bear on his fuller sound-- he's not just putting some drums and bass behind his guitar and voice.</p>
<p>Some of his bolder decisions carry mixed results. Beam brings in a horn section on ""Big Burned Hand"" and ""Your Fake Name Is Good Enough For Me"", and it works well on the latter, the album's seven-minute closer. The horns are arranged loosely, responding a bit to the Tinariwen-ish guitar phrase that opens the song and pulling it into territory somewhere near Charles Mingus' ""Haitian Fight Song"". The horn scrum is nicely offset by Beam's layered, tight self-harmonies on the chorus, and it's also complemented by the ragged lead guitar part. On ""Big Burned Hand"", though, the honking sax is used as a device to try and make the song funky, and it's not a look Beam's really figured out yet-- it lumbers along for four minutes and is the one song where Beam's risks yield no reward.</p>
<p>The more elemental and important change, though, is how Beam sings these songs. On ""Glad Man Singing"", his voice is still a soft instrument, but he's really projecting, both on the lead and the backing harmonies he layers in behind himself. On ""Me and Lazarus"", he reverts to the unique whisper-plus-falsetto layering technique he perfected on <i>The Shepherd's Dog</i> and ""Woman King"", and as signature sounds go, it's a good one that sounds even more distinct when he contrasts it with the other approaches. There are places on the album where the mix of rhythm and electric piano reminds me of <i>Still Crazy After All These Years</i>-era Paul Simon, a writer whose scope is reminiscent of what Beam is now trying to bring to his work.</p>
<p><i>Kiss Each Other Clean </i>isn't quite on the level of <i>The Shepherd's Dog</i> in terms of overall unity of vision. Oddly, even with Beam's generally bolder singing, it's also not quite as immediately striking. These songs are generally not the type to grab you right away, but there's enough mystery and melody there to call you back. It's an album that takes its time seeping in, and it's ultimately worth putting in the close listening that reveals its many details and delights.</p></div>"|15033.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15033-kiss-each-other-clean/|7.7|Joe Tangari

While both  shared remarkably strong songwriting, said single was recorded  without much of the fuzz and distortion that enveloped his work up  until that point. The difference was huge. Baldi's home-recorded hooks  had never been hard to hear, but out in the open, free of that lo-fi  asterisk, they thrived. Breaks were crisp, turnarounds hit like  boomerangs, and every sweet, tightly coiled melody could be savored in  full. In the lead-up to this, his first full-length in wide-release,  Baldi hinted that he'd continue to clarify his recordings. He stuck to  his guns.</p>
<p>The result is another fantastic step forward, though  not without some growing pains. In the transition from basement to studio, one  component has yet to come into full focus: Baldi's voice. The gap  between those sounds coming from his hands and those from his mouth is  noticeable. The opening five-song blast, as exhilarating an assemblage  of tracks as he's ever strung together, provides a useful chart of his  comfort level now that his voice is completely uncovered. Within the  insanely hummable, sometimes gummy verses of opener ""Understand At All"",  you can hear Baldi's voice originate just at his throat, where the screams of ""Not  Important"" hail. And while the latter motions toward the  skittering Midwestern pop-punk of the Promise Ring and recently reunited  Get Up Kids as much as Buzzcocks, its final gasp echoes (as though  in tribute) that of Wavves' Nathan Williams, another former lo-fi kid  who's made impressive use of the studio. ""Should Have""  opts however for the suburbs instead of the beach and the unabashed  melodicism of Gin Blossoms over Nirvana, Baldi's voice moving even  lower. Once ""Forget You All the Time"" arrives, he sounds as strong and confident behind the mic as he does unspooling all those gorgeous strands of guitar.</p>
<p>That  quick trip downward from mouth to core doesn't speak directly to the  quality of each song, but it does their overall delivery. When  ""Nothing's Wrong"" and its torrent of sugars and stutters begins just  seconds after, the shift in pitch and pace can be jarring. That feeling  isn't unusual throughout. Cloud Nothings' pop has become deceptively  dense-- there is literally (and paradoxically) so much hook to be found  here from corner to corner that, unlike similarly, ostensibly simple  records, multiple listens are required to appreciate the taste of all  its herks and jerks. In the late sear of ""Been Through"", Baldi hits a  lasting sweet spot. It's a song that moves swiftly and forcefully, the  calm vocal at its center not just its equal, but also the sort you hear when you first wake up any number of mornings thereafter.</p></div>"|15031.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15031-cloud-nothings/|7.9|David Bevan

So it's appropriate that his debut solo record serves as a sort of tribute to Conny Plank, the legendary German producer who had a hand in refining both the combustible grooves of Neu! and Can and more free-floating approach of Cluster and early Kraftwerk.</p>
<p>Those influences are keenly felt within the first 30 seconds of <i>Life Coach</i>'s opening track, ""FT2 Theme"", which knots a spidery Michael Rother-inspired guitar line to a plodding electro groove and vast sheets of vintage synth sounds. It's similar to the kind of retro-futurist feel that Trans Am have mastered over their expansive career. The difference is that the joints are a little more exposed here, with Manley delving into outright homage instead of using his influences as a touchstone from which he can spin off onto his own unique path. As such, aficionados of <i>Life Coach</i>'s most obvious inspirations will likely get a kick out of playing a game of spot the influence, whether it's drawn from the cyclical bliss of Manuel GÃ¶ttsching's <i>E2-E4</i> (on ""Night Visions""), or the nuanced ambient passages that unfurl on Harmonia's 1976 opus <i>Tracks &amp; Traces</i> (on ""Forest Opening Theme"").</p>
<p>So, there isn't a great degree of originality at work here, and Manley is certainly backward-looking in his approach. But it's a testament to his abilities that he is able to eke out compelling riffs and affecting spells of creativity from music that is perilously close to being over saturated as source material. The listless acoustic riff that coils throughout ""Lawrence, KS"" is one such moment, where Manley shifts his attention forward a few decades and hits on the kind of unshakable ennui David Pajo bled into Papa M's <i>Live From a Shark Cage</i>. Similarly, ""Work It Out"" is built around a towering expanse of guitar noise that veers close to Neil Young's <i>Arc</i> experiments, where form and function acquiesce to a kind of primitive, guttural euphoria.</p>
<p>The only vocal turn here is on ""Gay Bathers"", a brief freak-folk-inspired cut that works as a prelude to the ceaseless loops of ""Night Visions"", which in turn gives way to a closing title track that neatly bookends the album by returning to a similar well of inspiration (a bubbling synth spine layered with treated guitars) as its opening song. <i>Life Coach</i> is likely to be a small footnote in Manley's career, albeit one that allowed him to exorcise a few krautrock demons. It's to his credit that he never seems too in awe of his most obvious antecedents, instead simply choosing to flex his own capabilities within the tight constraints that musicians like Rother, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, and Dieter Moebius have operated within for decades. Still, it's a shame Manley didn't choose to filter more of his own ideas into the myriad eulogies on offer here.</p></div>"|14990.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14990-life-coach/|6.5|Nick Neyland

And I mean often literally <i>raw</i> chunks of sound. Unlike many of their once ultra-skronky underground peers who've since smartened up their sound, Zs music has grown expansive while retaining its harder-than-the-rest harshness.</p>
<p>Zs' play no wave with most of the remaining rock dynamited away, avant-classical delivered with noise-punk's fuck-you-all force, drone with a rusty eardrum-slicing edge. Even the calm moments of Zs' albums are more eye-of-the-storm than actual respites. So what's surprising about these remixes, jumping off from 2010's <i>New Slaves</i>, the band's most varied album yet, is how many of them reshape Zs' gales of blare into music that might appeal to those who look for more <i>music</i> in their music.</p>
<p>Not to say it's <i>all</i> suddenly accessible. Weasel Walter's typically skin-peeling screech and blat sounds like he's once again unleashed the free jazz hounds of hell. Thee Majesty's take on ""Concert Black"" is like an old computer on its last legs, motor whining on and off as it hacks up pitiful little data-farts. Of course that's what you'd expect from a Zs' remix album, which doesn't make it any less enjoyable. If you're buying <i>New Slaves Part II</i>, you're probably wanting a little horribleness in your day. But more than one of these remixers take a more beautiful (like Ecstatic Sunshine's slow-burning, almost Tortoise-ish post-rock guitar treatment) or beat-centric approach, sometimes straying into outright dance music.</p>
<p>Ragged rhythms occasionally surface in Zs' music, like the claustrophobic scrapyard gamelan on the original ""Acres of Skin"" from <i>New Slaves</i>,  but their music wouldn't fit even the broadest definition of ""house."" The comforting, body-friendly pulse of pop is always under attack in Zs' world, always ready to shatter into arrhythmia. Yet here's Gabe Andruzzi fashioning the textural elements (always a Zs' strong suit) of ""Acres"" into a humid techno track more Tresor club hit than <i>No New York</i>. These total overhauls won't give newbies much of a sense of what Zs' are all about, but then are remix comps ever really for newbies? For those who've found joy in the pain of Zs' forbidding industrial sprawl, consider the more radical rewrites on <i>New Slaves Part II</i> a little peek into what a more traditionally pleasure-centric, alternate-universe version of the band might be like.</p></div>"|15027.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15027-new-slaves-part-ii-essence-implosion/|6.8|Jess Harvell

But casual listeners probably won't find this story very obvious or especially compelling: On its surface, <i>Return of the Century </i>plays less like a biographical concept album and more like a series of tough-minded break-up songs that paint their vocalists as emotionally and sexually candid, if not occasionally even callous. ""If life was lonely then I'd be blessed,"" sings Jeanine O'Toole on ""Lay a Ghost"", ""if that was all I missed."" These aren't life-changing relationships they're singing about. In fact, they're barely worth the time, save the songs that came out of them.</p>
<p>In that regard, the 1900s recall another musician who many say has been missing for years: Liz Phair, whose <i>Exile in Guyville</i> was full of similar postcoital postmortems set in Chicago. She was, of course, much more explicit than the 1900s, whose lyrics are veiled and often playfully obscure, with songwriter Edward Anderson constructing knots of words for the listener to untie. Trading off vocals with O'Toole, he smartly leaves these songs coyly open-ended, so they could pertain to McKechnie's biography or to some Fleetwood Mac-style romantic pyrotechnics. But they have too much wit and too many layers of insight to be anonymous. Standout ""Tucson"" recalls a road trip through the Southwest and its fallout: ""I'm not so sorry that I took you along, you only saw me naked once,"" O'Toole sings, her voice steeled yet wistful. There's a lot to unpack in those lines, which sound like both a consolation and a kiss-off.</p>
<p>If the sentiments are tough, the music itself is tender, borrowing from Belle &amp; Sebastian and Brill Building pop to create a sound that is both pastoral and urbane, straightforward yet sophisticated. Anderson's hooks arise from unexpected turns of melodic phrase, and verses give way to rousing instrumental passages like the bridge of ""Lion's Fur"" and the galloping disco-breakdown on ""Babies"". <i>Return of the Century</i> is enticingly spare compared to the band's 2007 full-length debut, <i>Cold &amp; Kind</i> (whose title still applies), as if the sextet were still learning how to deploy their extensive roster. Andra Kulans' strings slice through ""Jean Demon"", alternately underscoring and undercutting O'Toole's pleas, and on ""Bmore"" they all click into a tight showtune groove anchored by Charlie Ransford's bass. ""Overreactin'"" opens with heavy breathing and chintzy boudoir beats, which ought to be either too hokey or too obvious but actually provide an apt introduction to a song about sexual compulsion. Whatever their inspiration may have been, the 1900s have turned their romantic misgivings into confident, catchy, and deceptively cheery pop.</p></div>"|15029.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15029-return-of-the-century/|7.5|Stephen M.

When considering this, it can be easy to forget that the sound developed as a way to express something. Music heard as kitsch years later was once put forth with complete sincerity. I mention this in connection with <i>Kaputt</i>, the new record from Dan Bejar's Destroyer, because the first thing that strikes you about the album is its unusual sound, one for which we've all developed a cluster of associations. The production and arrangements evoke a narrow window of time-- sometime between, say, 1977 and 1984, or between Chuck Mangione's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7dg8vRDM68"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Feels So Good""</a> and Sade's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNppzHXcuCs"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Diamond Life</i></a> with stops along the way for Roxy Music's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D6EiQs5KsY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Avalon</i></a> and Steely Dan's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0eBurafADk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Gaucho</i></a>. It slides between soft rock, smooth jazz, and new romantic pop. The bass is fretless; the synths have the blocky contrast of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Nagel"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nagel painting</a>; there are heavily reverbed trumpets and saxophones that almost serve as a Greek chorus, trilling away at the end of every line to enforce the beautiful plasticity of these songs. For Destroyer, this sound is new, and it's there for a reason.</p>
<p>The sound casts Bejar's songs in a very particular light, and reinforces the feeling of the singer as persona. Bejar has always come across this way to varying degrees, sure, and his albums all have their own unique feel-- the rootsy art-pop of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8970-destroyers-rubies/"" target=""_blank""><i>Destroyer's Rubies</i></a>, the MIDI experiments of <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2293-your-blues/"" target=""_blank""><i>Your Blues</i></a>, and so on. But here the persona seems even more sharply defined. Singing these songs, Bejar comes over as the wizened ex-playboy; he's indulged every vice, come through the other side, and now looks on amused. The <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c8/Death_of_a_Ladies_Man.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cover of Leonard Cohen's <i>Death of a Ladies' Man</i></a>, a record that seems to serve as a spiritual (though not sonic) father to this one, shows this figure in its quintessential form. On that sleeve, we see a man in sharp but slightly disheveled dress, a cigarette dangling from a couple of fingers; beautiful people are seated at the nightclub table, ready for another night of glamor and pleasure.</p>
<p>Leonard Cohen in that image has a sense of swagger, and you want to pull up a chair, have a drink, and hear him hold forth on the topic of his choice. The figure inside the songs of <i>Kaputt</i> understands the allure of this life while understanding equally its futility. On early listens, a couple of lines from the <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/12075-kaputt/"" target=""_blank"">title track</a> jump out and seem to serve as a thesis for the record as a whole. ""Wasting your days chasing some girls, alright/ Chasing cocaine through the backrooms of the world all night,"" Bejar sings, as horns twist around in a bath of reverb. He sounds bemused, but not necessarily judgmental, holding two feelings in mind at once: our reflex to indulge ourselves, and the knowledge that it's killing us.</p>
<p>But this happens on just one level, which is what makes <i>Kaputt</i> so fantastic. It goes as deep as you want to go. People can miss that Dan Bejar is funny as hell-- he seeds his music with lyrical and musical in-jokes, and everyone has their own favorite lines to pluck out of his songs and admire for their concise wit. He likes surprises-- few lyric sheets have as many exclamation points. But the essential quality of all his records is complexity. They are doing a lot of things at once. <i>Kaputt</i> feels rich.</p>
<p>For one, there is the surface beauty of the sound. Some less inclined to the pleasures of the music from the aforementioned era might have an initial reaction to its essential corniness, but once you've tuned in, it sounds beautiful. The songs seem delicate and glassy and shimmering, and Bejar has toned down his quirky voice and sounds relaxed and focused. So it's easy to enjoy bumping the wet, jazzy pop of ""Chinatown"", which suggests the rainy streets of an old city and new dramas unfolding around every corner. Or wallow in the simple and elegant hook of ""Blue Eyes"", the way Bejar voice works next to Vancouver singer Sibel Thrasher, a regular vocal presence on <i>Kaputt</i> who sort of serves as the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXfROqR_p1A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nicolette Larson</a> to Bejar's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELakJxPiieU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Neil Young</a>. But ""Blue Eyes"" also has sly lyrical references (""your first love's new order,"" ""Mother Nature's Son"") and funny put-downs (""I sent a message in a bottle to the press/ It said, 'Don't be ashamed or disgusted with yourselves'""). More than any other Destroyer record, you can just throw this on and it sounds good, and plenty will do well stopping there. But for those so inclined, there's more to explore.</p>
<p>So the lite-jazz style can seem a little funny, but it can also be sad and sexy and joyous. And the writing is dense with references-- to other songs on the album, songs by other bands, to the music business, art outside the sphere of music. ""Suicide Demo for Kara Walker"" is the most striking example. It's a collaboration with the <a href=""http://learn.walkerart.org/karawalker"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">artist Kara Walker</a>, whose work, among other things, probes the racial history of America. Bejar adapted the words she provided for him on cue cards, and the result is fragmented and dream-like, taking the Destroyer project to a new place. ""Wise, old, black and dead in the snow: My Southern sister..."" isn't the sort of thing we've heard from him before. An early demo of the song reminded Bejar of the band Suicide, <a href=""http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/36747/walker-on-the-wild-side-dan-bejar-on-his-musical-collaboration-with-artist-kara-walker/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hence the title</a>. That's how things work in his world. Laughs are mixed with grim insights.</p>
<p>Two tracks stick out a bit here. The astonishing <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11433-bay-of-pigs/"" target=""_blank"">""Bay of Pigs""</a>, released as a single in 2009, concludes the CD version of this album, and it's the one song that feels out of place. It's longer, proggy, uses different textures, and ultimately seems to be here because it's an amazing song and as many people as possible need to hear it. Fair enough. And the vinyl version of <i>Kaputt</i> also has a side-long, 20-minute ambient track with just a bit of voice called ""The Laziest River"", which is enjoyable and immersive but not essential. Both indulgences are easily forgivable.</p>
<p>Bands can be brands or concepts that can be summed up in a line or two-- which is the power of brands. It's a good thing in proper doses. But Bejar's essential complexity ultimately feels human. It seems absurd to look for genuine wisdom in music in 2011, when we're constantly gorging ourselves on the all-you-can-eat buffet of post-modern web culture. But <i>Kaputt</i> feels wise. Like a mirror that actually points back at something better. Something you can jam and let wash over you, but also something you can use. It feels funny, tragic, artful, and ultimately true.</p></div>"|15034.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15034-kaputt/|8.8|Mark Richardson

No one got it worse than the Get Up Kids, attacked with the vigor of a scene that finally got to pick on someone its own size. Existing somewhere between the Promise Ring and Jimmy Eat World-- but lacking the former's jittery roots and the latter's obvious pop ambitions-- they once worked with Bob Weston (Mission of Burma, Shellac) and chose not to leave Vagrant, and yet somehow an air of dishonesty was projected on them. Considering they were just some guys from Kansas City who wanted to write songs called ""Anne Arbour"" and cover MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e, I'm not sure the churlish punishment fits the crime.</p>
<p><i>There Are Rules </i>isn't a return to form sonically-- neither to the limp, acoustic bowouts of <i>On a Wire </i>or <i>Guilt Show </i>nor to the eager-to-please effervescence of <i>Something to Write Home About</i>-- but a return to results, a just-all-right record from a band that always felt a step behind even in their own genre. The announcement that Weston was brought back in certainly perked some ears, but anyone expecting his gnarly edge to improve much on their material is destined to be disappointed. ""Tithe"" and ""Birmingham"" are the most obvious beneficiaries of Weston's imprimatur, and they snarl more than anything the Get Up Kids have done in the past. But these dudes just can't do menace, in large part because Matthew Pryor's vocals are the literal embodiment of ""snotty,"" emanating almost completely from his nostrils.</p>
<p>What they <i>can </i>do is momentarily remold themselves in the form of borderline-emo go-getters Hot Hot Heat on spasmodic word puzzles ""Automatic"" and ""Pararelevant"", or regain some of their caffeinated buzz on ""Regent's Court"". And though they have dabbled in synth-pop before, ""Shatter Your Lungs"" is a legitimate surprise-- Pryor's vocals soften and let the tumbling melody come to him rather than force it, hinting at the sort of maturity <i>There Are Rules</i> should have aimed for.</p>
<p>The title of the album's closer, ""Rememorable"", proves to be pretty ironic, considering they completely forget what made them popular in the first place: the hooks. <i>There Are Rules</i> drags toward its middle, relying more on repetition than snappy melodies for growth: ""Rally 'Round the Fool"" feigns importance with the sort of vague paranoia and electro dabbling that characterized alt-rock's post-<i>OK Computer </i>obsession, followed by a run of three songs that do little else but allow Rob Pope's grinding bass riffs to drill fruitlessly for paydirt.</p>
<p>Gone are the band's geographic puns and tales of the romantic rigors of college freshman, but they're replaced by a professional anonymity that kinda sums up the problem with <i>There Are Rules</i>: When you spent the prime of your career trying to document the contours of post-teen torment, what happens when you no longer have a first-hand view? Get Up Kids likely don't have an answer because none of their peers did either: Jimmy Eat World soldiered on with drastically diminishing returns, Saves the Day alienated almost their entire fanbase with the surprisingly sophisticated pop of <i>In Reverie</i>, the Promise Ring broke up, Hey Mercedes were dead on arrival post-Braid, and Dashboard Confessional just sort of became something beyond judgment. For those of us who spent the tumult of our teen years with their records, we can hear the Get Up Kids and just think of them kindly.</p></div>"|15010.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15010-there-are-rules/|5.4|Ian Cohen

After all, their previous two records were surprisingly good for a band known more for spectacle than their music, which tends to get lost in all their live chaos. So it seemed possible that they had reached a level where their sound itself could be as noticeable as their shows.</p>
<p>You can tell by now how that worked out. It turns out that <i>Not Yet </i>is an apt title for this collection of unambitious grunge-punk tunes. Monotonix remain beholden to the kind of churning, muscular groove carved out by the Stooges and Mudhoney. There's no doubt they're good disciples-- Singer Ami Shalev's howl rises and falls with guitarist Yonatan Gat's thick riffs and drummer Haggai Fershtman's punching beats. Every song is pretty enjoyable, but none is all that memorable. The grinding riff of ""Before I Pass Away"", the Mudhoney swing of ""Fun Fun Fun"", and the dramatic echoes of ""Late Night"" sound good when they're happening. But I'm more likely to remember the time I saw Shalev jump off a balcony than to hum any of these tunes from memory.</p>
<p>Which points out an odd paradox with Monotonix: If they're so into chaos when performing, why do their records sound so rote? Live, Shalev never lets anything get in the way of whatever crazy physical move leaps into his head. Yet he and his bandmates allow each song to stick to its opening riff and beat, playing so by-the-numbers that surprises are basically non-existent. Monotonix could stand to let go sonically-- take some left turns, mash up conflicting beats, devolve into noise, play something ""wrong."" They certainly have the energy to go a little crazy musically; no one can say Monotonix lack physical effort on <i>Not Yet. </i>But to get people to care as much about listening to them as witnessing their live shows, it's time to work on the muscles of their imagination.</p></div>"|14994.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14994-not-yet/|6.2|Marc Masters

It's a choice of nomenclature that fits indie's recent obsession with childhood and nostalgia, as does the album cover art. Yet when you open the CD edition of <i>Unlearn</i>, you're greeted with the following message printed on the disc: ""You still buy CDs?""</p>
<p>That arch, slightly confrontational humor extended to their performance at the 2010 CMJ showcase hosted by fellow Texan, blogger Gorilla vs. Bear. F&amp;G were in full snark mode, sarcastically toasting the event's sponsors (and the blog conglomerates that love them), jibing at trust-fund Brooklyn man-babies, and (in the case of one member) wearing a ""Free O.J. Simpson"" t-shirt. This sense of dismissal carries over to <i>Unlearn</i>, where the band fires shots at neo-crunch yuppies (""Where the Walls Are Made of Grass""), baby boomers (the appropriately titled ""Baby Boomer/Could You Deliver""), and music critics (""Wanna Know What I Would Do?"").</p>
<p>All in all, they're pretty fucking funny when they want to be, but this isn't so much ""joke music"" as ""music with jokes."" Kelly and Savage claim inspiration from Sparks,  another duo with arch humor and serious chops. While there are precious few glam-rock moves involved with F&amp;G, the connection to the brothers Mael holds some spiritual water. Whereas Sparks tended to shift melodic motifs within songs like a Rube Goldberg contraption, Kelly and Savage refuse to stay stylistically still throughout <i>Unlearn</i>, drawing from doo-wop, British folk, garage rock, and the easy jangle of the Who's less incendiary moments.</p>
<p>If it all sounds like a little much, that's because it kind of is-- don't come to this record expecting cohesion or form; you're not going to find much of it here. It's worth charging through <i>Unlearn</i>'s varied territory, though, for the smoldering strummer ""Forced Aloha"", as well as the closing track, in which vocalist Elyse Shrock testifies in spoken word over a warm, 1950s pop song structure about rebelling against authority and refusing to ""[bow] to their cross."" It's a clever move to couch such countercultural statements within a musical template known for buttoned-up formalism. But its deeper appeal is that it's earwormy enough to take a casual listener multiple go-rounds to pick up on that.</p></div>"|14968.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14968-unlearn/|7.2|Larry Fitzmaurice

Technically, they have-- both are members of the New York outfit GHQ, alongside Pete Nolan of Magik Markers and Marcia Bassett of Double Leopards. But their two-man guitar-drums project has been going only for about a year. In that short time, they've honed a remarkably confident, open sound. They mix touches of folk, psych, raga, and rock into hypnotic pieces that straddle the line between improvisation and songcraft.</p>
<p>None of that should be a surprise to anyone familiar with Gunn, whose 2009 solo album, <i>Boerum Palace</i>, was a masterwork of guitar exploration. Flying through finger-picked blues, country twang, and wiry electric essays, Gunn mined many traditions while adding a new touch to each. It would be tempting to guess that record's diversity was a product of doing it himself, but <i>Sand City </i>shows his wide-ranging style can also mesh tightly with a collaborator. On all four tracks, his string wizardy snakes through and wraps around Truscinski's drumming, as if the two had discovered a secret ability to silently trade thoughts and rhyme ideas.</p>
<p>Calling their conversations telepathic might be overdoing it, but there is a magic, almost psychic quality to these songs. Maybe it's just the way the duo approaches raga, with a loose, intuitive sense that's somewhere between Jack Rose's solo mediations (themselves inspired by John Fahey) and the Sun City Girls' reverent adoptions of Eastern melodies. The best example is the album's longest track, the 13-minute ""Wythe Raag"", which starts like a sunrise over a temple, gradually building to a sonic epiphany. As Gunn's electric guitar climbs up Truscinski's mallet-heavy steps, I'm reminded of John Coltrane and Rashied Ali's intertwining prayers on their 1967 LP, <i>Interstellar Space</i>. It's obviously way too early to put this pair in that class, but the fact that they even bring such reference points to mind is impressive.</p>
<p>Either way, reducing <i>Sand City </i>to comparisons or influences is unfair. Gunn and Truscinki's conversations, like any good musical dialogue, are marked primarily by the unique idiosyncrasies of their particular speech. It will be interesting to see where they take their discussion next-- <i>Sand City </i>is only 31 minutes long, and you get the sense that the pair could make reams more music like this without repeating themselves much, if at all.</p></div>"|15003.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15003-sand-city/|7.4|Marc Masters

Go back 20 years and listen to some of their earliest recordings as a duo. They're very good, a husband and wife singing together, supported only by his guitar. But they give very little hint regarding where they'd find themselves at this point in their career, as fixtures on the international festival circuit and collaborators with Damon Albarn and Manu Chao. Their move from that humble beginning into a transcendent style that embraces music from all over the world has been wholehearted, and the duo's last two albums, <i>Dimanche Ã Bamako</i> and <i>Welcome to Mali</i>, were both excellent examples of the way pop can be transcultural without losing its sense of regional identity.</p>
<p><i>Remixes</i> is, it must be said, not as essential as those two albums, either in terms of overall vision or overall quality. It is, however, interesting and worthwhile in other ways. First, some of the music is quite good, and that's obviously the most important thing. But beyond that, it presents a sort of alternate-reality Amadou &amp; Mariam, where the couple are less borderless pop stars than hosts of a melting-pot dance party. It's not a bad reality. The record starts a little slowly, following a rather straight take on ""Africa"" that pushes guest rapper K'Naan even further to the fore than the version on <i>Welcome to Mali</i> with a couple of tracks that don't quite grasp the rhythmic pulse and inclusive grasp of their source. Like Akon's remix of ""Coulibaly"", which loses all the original's fluency.</p>
<p>Things pick up in the middle, though. It's not surprising that the spare synth-pop song ""Sabali"" is a popular choice for the remixers, appearing three times here. Miike Snow focuses on its cosmic qualities, building it into a space-age pop hymn, while Vitalic blows it out into a sweeping but compact synth-house track. Grey X Sage's move to turn it into a duet between Mariam and Theophilus London is imaginative but a little cluttered. Ashley Beedle's ""Afrikanz on Marz"" remix of ""Coulibaly"" captures the spirit of the original more than Akon's take, essentially retrofitting it as modern disco, which is a popular approach on the disc overall. The best track may be the Mo DJ remix of ""Masiteladi""-- it's built around Amadou's fiery lead guitar work, and its combination of electronic textures and Malian balafon (a type of xylophone) feels natural.</p>
<p>Amadou &amp; Mariam are reported to be working on a new album with a whole new set of partners. In the meantime, <i>Remixes</i> speaks to the strength and flexibility of the music they've already made, even as it often struggles to hit on anything as exciting as its source material.</p></div>"|15017.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15017-remixes/|6.8|Joe Tangari

It opens with ""Mr. Fantastic Must Die"", a kind of Who-does-MotÃ¶rheadÂ ruckus trip; five minutes later there's ""I Wanna Be Your Man in the Moon"", which comes off a bit like <i>Something Else</i>-era Kinks doing a Who cover of their own. At times, <i>Space City Kicks</i> is raucous, borderline rude; at others, it's quite lovely and ornate, the most sonically lush Pollard release in some time. For all its easy charms, it's a puzzler.</p>
<p>And Pollard needed a weird one. Certainly the guy knows what goes into a decent song-- all too well, sometimes. Albums like last fall's dread-suffused <i>Moses on a Snail</i> chug along competently enough, songs formed and played with requisite authority but without much apparent passion. The best Pollard songs have a real life to them, like he couldn't wait to play them for you; certain solo efforts, though, felt more like he couldn't wait to get the record out so he could move onto something else. Maybe that was the case with the tiresome, monochromatic <i>Moses</i>; the slippery, vibrant <i>Space City Kicks</i> seeks to atone for <i>Moses</i>' sins with a serious uptick in eclecticism and energy both. Mostly, though, <i>Space City</i>'s not afraid to goof around, and the playful tone of the album's rockers seems to seep into some of the more straightfaced power-pop.</p>
<p>What gloriously dunderheaded Chevy Astro van fodder the title track is; in another decade, you'd drive around introducing mailboxes to metal bats with this thing jammed in the deck. The rangy, queasy ""Sex She Said"" is this album's ""Hot Freaks""-- an outlier, somewhat unprecedented, more than a little off, and weirdly compelling. As Uncle Bob runs boudoir color commentary, the music churns, all sandpapery guitar and incidental percussion. You might not like it, but you're not likely to forget it. Dirge ""Picture a Star"" is so drenched in reverb, it's hard to imagine anything through the muck; it comes right before ""Something Strawberry"", a bright, sprightly lilter that recalls late-GBV coulda-been-singles like ""The Best of Jill Hives"". After that, it's ""Follow a Loser"", with its mopey verses and redemptive chorus, and ""Children Ships"", which climaxes in what sounds like the strings from Led Zeppelin's ""Kashmir"", only tripled, and played backward. The next song is barely a minute long, and it might just be the catchiest thing here.</p>
<p>So it goes all throughout <i>Space City</i>; Pollard and company seem especially unfiltered when it comes to ideas, yet unusually patient in bringing them to life. I've complained of constant Pollard solo companion Todd Tobias' often staid, workmanlike production in the past, but <i>Space City</i> is a rich, vibrant album, managing everything from the rollicking guitar-bass-drum offset of ""Mr. Fantastic Must Die"" to the nicely unadorned, Pollard-centric ""Woman to Fly"". That one's the true stunner here; drowsy at first, dazzling as it goes, it takes a simple strum and worn-in sounding Pollard melody, cobbles together some imprecise but effortlessly affecting lyrics about ""a woman who's nice,"" sneaks in just the right kind of echo, and makes the thing sound timeless. Weird how he keeps doing that.</p></div>"|15022.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15022-space-city-kicks/|6.8|Paul Thompson

The retrospective celebrating 10 years of Ghostly International's existence runs 30 tracks long, totaling in a little over two and a half hours of music. It's only available digitally, along with it's PDF-formatted <i>The Ghostly Book</i> companion. So, it's a large volume of data, with not much in the way of tangible merchandise-- which, for Ghostly, is fitting. Whether this was label founder Sam Valenti's intention or not, much of the label's output fits right into modern indie's home-recorded electronic pop fascinations from the past few years, its most recent signees-- Gold Panda, Com Truise, Shigeto-- having been plucked from that very movement.</p>
<p>Consider <i>We'll Never Stop Living This Way</i>, then, a well-curated RSS feed, covering everything from techno (Osborne, Lawrence) to instrumental hip-hop (Dabrye, Shigeto) to LCD Soundsystem-indebted dance rock (Matthew Dear) to emotional post-rock (JDSY, Midwest Product), with plenty more gaps filled in along the way. It's stated in <i>The Ghostly Book</i> that electronic artists aren't frequently acknowledged as ""album artists"". In saying so, a truth about Ghostly is unintentionally revealed: They have only about a handful of ""important"" full-lengths in their catalog, most of which have seen release in the last few years.</p>
<p>The isolated-track format, however, suits their repertoire well, showcasing especially their taste in dance-oriented sounds that radiate auras of gray warmth while remaining percolating enough for club consumption. These sounds take up the majority of the comp and do a decent job of masking its difficult-to-digest running time; the run from Tycho's ""Coastal Brake"" to Lawrence's ""Five Leaves"" feels especially like a well-mixed DJ set. That said, Ghostly's taste in straight-rock sounds has never been as refined; cuts from the late perennial electro-rock also-rans the Mobius Band and sad-sack Danish outfit Choir of Young Believers bring the comp's momentum to enough of a screeching, uncomfortable halt that the only justification for their inclusion is mere completism.</p>
<p><i>The Ghostly Book</i> fares slightly less well; for one thing, unless you have a tablet-esque device that makes it an easy read, it's still no fun to read a book in PDF format when the physical alternative remains so tactilely alluring. Furthermore, the information contained within doesn't hold much revelatory weight for non-die-hards; indeed, the most curious thing about it is that its chronological coverage seems to cease around in late 2009-- or, right before the label released two of its most successful full-lengths to date, Gold Panda's fantastic debut album, <i>Lucky Shiner</i>, and Matthew Dear's darkly alluring <i>Black City</i>. The comp itself doesn't seem to reflect these recent riches either, choosing GP's techy ""You"" B-side ""Peaky Caps"" and the opening track from Dear's 2007 LP, <i>Asa Breed</i>, the sensually smothering ""Fleece on Brain"".</p>
<p>Minor outrage could be leveled, too, that Osborne's ""Outta Sight"", from the producer's criminally overlooked self-titled 2008 release, gets an acid-washed Luke Vibert remix that, while neat on its own merits, makes one familiar with the source material long for the untouched original. That the obvious choices from Ghostly's catalog are ignored in favor of deep cuts, however, only reinforces the label's stance as deep-listening curators, rather than heat-seeking hitmakers. When this collection is approached as such, <i>We'll Never Stop Living This Way</i> becomes less of a title and more of a maxim-- one that, hopefully, they continue to do business by.</p></div>"|15019.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15019-well-never-stop-living-this-way-a-ghostly-primer/|7.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

After spending some time as one half of Russian Literature, he opened for Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy as Dark Hand and Lamplight, which involved playing acoustic songs while an artist displayed paintings behind him. Already he's had a storied career, so it's odd to think of his 2008 self-titled album as his debut and even harder to think of <i>Constant Companion</i> as only his second release. Both sound effortless and insightful, full of songs that draw you in with their peaceful, easy surface and then dump a big load of hurt on you.</p>
<p>Country remains Paisley's foundation, providing both a subject (relationships in various states of disrepair) and a musical approach that favors straightforward arrangements and spare instrumentation. But the twang in his voice has softened into a gentle burr that recalls the 1970s heyday of outdoorsy singer-songwriters, without putting too fine a point on the nostalgia. He's neither quite country nor folk anymore, but something in between, something that tends to get dismissed as sonic wallpaper by those who aren't willing to dig beyond the surface of the music. In that regard, <i>Constant Companion </i>exceeds <i>Doug Paisley</i> in terms of both the serenity of the surface and the hard truths lurking just beneath, drawing out more hummable melodies as well as more stinging observations. The pedal steel that helped define his debut's sense of isolation is gone, replaced this time by Garth Hudson on keys. The former Band member's counterintuitive piano and organ riffs enliven ""No One But You"" and ""End of the Day"", alternately taunting and consoling as he acts as a foil for Paisley-- a gremlin in the works. Subtle harmonies by Leslie Feist, Jennifer Castle, and Julie Faught of the Pining alleviate the loneliness only minimally.</p>
<p>Death and departure loom over <i>Constant Companion</i>, infusing even the smallest moments with a sense of loss and dread. ""At the end of the long, long day/ Come go with me in the blue and the gray,"" he sings on ""End of the Day"". It sounds like a warm invitation until his real meaning sinks in: ""There's no up there's no down/ And there's no way around."" Those metaphysics-minded lines don't amount to a suicide pact necessarily, but they do comprise a chilling acknowledgement that every relationship inevitably ends, whether in tears or in death. All you have is yourself, that quietly disturbing album cover attests (seriously, take another look at it). And yet, Paisley's mood isn't woe-is-me dejection, but rather a stoic resignation to the fact that you're ultimately your own constant companion, for better or for worse.</p></div>"|15006.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15006-constant-companion/|7.5|Stephen M.

Their music, a plinky, stripped-down take on swoony synth-pop, is a sort of lovers' rock; hat in hand, frontman Jesse Kivel musters the best chorus on <i>The Heart of the Nightlife</i> when he asks the object of his affection-- that'd be bandmate Zinzi Edmundson-- out for a nice steak dinner, just her and him. Kivel's got no shortage of sweet nothings to direct at Edmundson, and it's no stretch to imagine these two staring right through each other as they churn out their lightly funky new romantic mash notes. The songs on <i>Heart of the Nightlife</i> are simple, fairly easygoing; the sentiments expressed within, perhaps doubly so. But Kisses' lovedrunk geniality and aversion to melodrama keeps the merely cute <i>Heart of the Nightlife</i> from toppling over into the dreaded cutesiness.</p>
<p>Kivel sounds a bit like Bernard Sumner after a good day at the spa, his dusky deadpan a good foil for some of his more gawkily straightfaced lyrics. He's got a good bit of Jens Lekman in there, too, and there's more than a passing similarity to the Swede's homespun Balearic sunshine of some of these arrangements. Kisses mostly lack the dark sense of humor running through both New Order and especially Lekman's music; when Kivel notes ""people can do the most amazing of things,"" he seems to believe it, so you do, too. These are love songs, kissed with a bit of nostalgia, riddled with a bit of doubt, and imbued with a little fantasy. They seem especially innocent, untroubled, still in the throes of first love, not sitting around waiting for the bottom to fall out. Even when, on opener ""Kisses"", Edmundson presumably happens upon ""a couple of girls kissing"" Kivel, you get the feeling they'll work it out.</p>
<p>It's a lightness of tone that's matched by the airy, all-notes-accounted-for music, ranging from the dancefloor electro-burble of ""Midnight Lover"" to the late-afternoon beach-scene wash of ""On the Move"". They're got a real knack for keeping arrangements nimble and uncluttered; the dancier stuff feels expansive enough for the club yet dinky enough to've come from the bedroom, which is where I suspect Kivel and Edmundson would have you end up anyhow. Kivel's voice, whether he's breaking down phrases in ""On the Move"" or finding his way into the pocket of ""Kisses"", always seems to be sliding from note to note, which injects a little movement into even the more staid <i>Heart of the Nightlife</i> tracks. But <i>Heart of the Nightlife</i> mostly gets along on its good nature, its squiggly arrangements, and Kivel's almost quaint devotionals. True, Kisses might come off a bit like that too-perfect couple who drink all night and Farmer's Market all morning, but when they invite you along, saying no kinda makes you the asshole.</p></div>"|15025.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15025-the-heart-of-the-nightlife/|7.0|Paul Thompson

Tennis, we learned, were a married boy-girl duo from Denver, and their earliest circulated mp3s came with an odd story. After finishing college in Colorado, the couple sold their possessions, bought a sailboat, and embarked on an extended trip along the Eastern Seaboard. After returning to land, they began to write and record songs based on their experiences. Their music, as heard here on their full-length debut, touches on tide patterns and shifting winds and sandbars scraping beneath hulls; it also emphasizes the essential romance of the whole adventure-- that they went through it all together. Above all, Tennis strive to evoke an unnamed but certainly more innocent past.</p>
<p>Everything about the project comes to us through a thick, triple-folded blanket of nostalgia. From the band's name (a sport that had its peak popularity in the 1970s and 80s) to the overall sound (girl-group pop is the basic template) to the record's cover to the choice of font, it all seems to yearn for one bygone day or another-- the 60s, the 80s, those seven months they spent on the water. The musical structures are straightforward, led by simple guitar lines and rhythms that are either waltz-time invitations to slow dance or more upbeat numbers with the familiar 1-2-pause-3 beat (think the Shirelles' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbxxkwBQk_o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Will You Love Me Tomorrow""</a>, the Chiffons' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXpk-KNZn1s"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""One Fine Day""</a>, etc.) so evocative of when <a href=""http://www.spectropop.com/hbrill.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brill Building</a> songwriters ruled the airwaves. The muffled recording, on the other hand, might be an attempt to capture the feel of a cheap AM radio spilling out of a bungalow, but it mostly serves to make the music sound distant and indistinct.</p>
<p>Tennis have a good ear for a tune and a solid understanding of how pop songs in this style fit together. The finger-snap-and-voice opening of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S5NZYZae4k"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Marathon""</a> has an appealingly peppy hook, the guitar twang in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDeaCINWV6c"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Long Boat Pass""</a> is of the proper vintage, and the melody on <a href=""http://vimeo.com/13010675"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""South Carolina""</a> has a nice build to the chorus break. Alaina Moore sings lead and has a likable voice, though her way of stretching vowels, when combined with the dull recording, sometimes makes the words hard to follow. Still, in single-song doses, the music on <i>Cape Dory</i> is pleasant, if not particularly memorable or expressive of anything in particular.</p>
<p>The problem comes when the music is taken at album length. Even though these 10 songs clock in at less than 30 minutes, their cumulative effect is weirdly numbing. Part of it is up to the central conceit: An extended getaway on a sloop is nice enough image, but is the allure of this one fantasy enough to sustain a record? Not when there is so little personality emanating from the songs themselves. Say what you will about Jimmy Buffett, an artist most people I know consider to be among the most loathsome of the modern popular era, but his tales of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpsTRbJKoa0"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">island hopping</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mw4xI4xkeyo"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">boat drinks</a> have a sense of humor and an identifiable point of view. Tennis, conversely, seem content to hit their marks, replicate an established style, and let the associations that come with a familiar sound do the emotional work. Bizarrely, considering the detailed and unique backstory, which describes something these two went through and which most of us will never experience even if we wanted to, <i>Cape Dory</i> comes over as a depersonalized exercise. It seems too concerned about transmitting a very specific sound and getting all the nautical details right. So while the record is pretty and intermittently enjoyable, it feels one-note and ultimately flat.</p></div>"|15020.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15020-cape-dory/|6.2|Mark Richardson

In just a few short paragraphs, Henry evokes not so much the music made by the Minneapolis band, but presumably what the music was about: wayward drifters with sad histories who disappeared, hitting the road in search of better times. The Jayhawks were never so down on their luck as their characters, but they were drifters just the same, ostensibly headquartered in the Twin Cities but always traveling to the next show and the next show after that. In the late 1980s and early 90s, they stayed on the road almost constantly, paying their dues and gradually playing to larger and larger audiences. They were alt-country merely by coincidence, gestating in isolation and predating the movement by several years. The band incorporated a wide range of styles and influences into their stately Americana, not just country and certainly not punk, but classic rock, folk, power pop, and lots of feedback from Gary Louris fuzzbox-filtered guitar-- all seemingly absorbed with every mile of road traveled and every city played.</p>
<p>What the Jayhawks never drifted toward was success-- at least not the kind that they and their fans felt the music warranted. Even so, a full 25 years after forming, the Jayhawks don't come across as also-rans, which is itself a minor miracle. <i>Hollywood Town Hall </i>and <i>Tomorrow the Green Grass</i> still live and breathe, and these two new, long-awaited reissues sound like the logical conclusions of a legacy-shaping campaign that began with 2009's career retrospective, <i>Music From the North Country</i>. Neither of these albums was a hit, exactly, but they have endured to become something more impressive. They show the Jayhawks unmoored from any one particular trend or style, devising new ways to combine roots and rock without skimping on either.</p>
<p><i>Hollywood Town Hall </i>is, appropriately, a good road-trip album, moving from pre-dawn departure (""Waiting for the Sun"") to a hard-won destination (""Martin's Song"", with its chorus, ""I've been working all night, I go long into day""). Louris' guitar cuts elegant swathes through these songs, and the new remaster brings out the rich tones in the instruments themselves, especially Benmont Tench's organ on ""Crowded in the Wings"". The songs have a greater live feel, but <i>Hollywood Town Hall </i>remains primarily a vocal album, with the harmonies of Louris and Olson at the center. Their approach is based on old-time country sibling acts like the Louvin and Stanley Brothers, yet those tightly intertwined vocals are reset in a dusty, electrified setting, marking perhaps the Jayhawks' greatest innovation.</p>
<p>The five bonus tracks neither distract from nor add to the original, but they do reveal the tracklist as a model of economic editing and sequencing. Every song sounds ideally and carefully concise, adding to the effect of the whole. Because it is so economic, <i>Hollywood Town Hall </i>becomes the Jayhawks' greatest statement. By contrast, <i>Tomorrow the Green Grass</i> sprawls to 13 tracks, representing a looser, more experimental tack. The band tinkers with some new sounds and ideas-- some of which are revelatory, others not so much. Opener ""Blue"" is the hit that should have been, a rambling lament that soars on the band's most majestic chorus, and ""I'd Run Away"" opens and closes with a string section that revs the song to a fleet gait that underscores, not undermines, the lyrics' loneliness.</p>
<p>As <i>Tomorrow</i> proceeds, the Jayhawks pursue those experiments too doggedly, or they simply don't anchor them to especially compelling songs. ""Miss Williams' Guitar"", a mash note to Olson's future wife, Victoria Williams, is sweet but shrill, and the bar-rock riffing of ""Real Light"" doesn't sound especially believable in this setting. The album's final half sounds particularly scattershot: The abrasive ""Red's Song"" and the sappy ""Ann Jane"" would have sounded better as B-sides at the time and bonus tracks in the future. <i>Tomorrow</i> is one or two tracks too long, a generous gesture that nevertheless lessens its impact, making it an uneven follow-up to <i>Hollywood Town Hall</i>.</p>
<p>Similarly, this <i>Tomorrow</i> reissue sprawls with a second disc of bonus tracks, comprised of what have become known among fans as the Mystery Demos. A collection of acoustic run-throughs whose origins were until recently unknown, they feature Louris and Olson tackling a career's worth of songs on acoustic guitar, with Mike ""Razz"" Russell on fiddle and mandolin. Some, like an especially sadsack version of ""Blue"", are well-known Jayhawks songs; others, like the power-pop ""Won't Be Coming Home"", would show up later as Golden Smog songs. Some were revived for Olson and Louris' reunion album, <i>Ready for the Flood</i>, and still others have never been heard before. While the reissue includes barely half of the entire Mystery Demos collection (which deserves its own release), these eighteen tracks comprise their own Jayhawks retrospective, an alt-universe greatest hits that sums up the group's appeal as persuasively as any of their proper albums. Stripping the band down to its essentials-- just two voices singing ruminatively and forlornly-- these bonus tracks show just how unnecessary everything else was and just how much direction there was in the band's constant drifting.</p></div>"|14940.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14940-hollywood-town-hall-expanded-edition-tomorrow-the-green-grass-legacy-edition/|8.3|Stephen M.

Fuck merely flying-- these guys want to soar, to be godlike observers proudly watching their music soundtrack the biggest moments of your life. One of the tracks here is called <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEANr1ZE2UA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Power and the Glory""</a>, and it sounds exactly like you think it does, i.e., more needlessly grandiose than <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Sl20Yrx6o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">both</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Sl20Yrx6o"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kanye</a> songs combined. Problem is, for the second straight album, they do so with the same exact set of tools as every other band in this sphere. So critiquing <i>Ritual</i> threatens to be a process of listing obvious influences that's just as dull as actually listening to the thing.</p>
<p>I will say that lead singer Harry McVeigh might be just someone incapable of feeling shame rather than someone who has no idea what his own lyrics even mean. Cringe-inducing lines like, ""You were crying on the shoulders of the men in the shadows/ Whoever taught you to sell your sex like that?"" pop up with alarming regularity, but what makes this most confusing of all is its context in the sort of empathy-rock that's supposed to cue Pavlovian handholding and liplocking amongst concertgoers. Which is why I should tip my cap to <i>Ritual</i> highlight ""Streetlights"" which at least is such an obvious rip of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ldyx3KHOFXw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Cars""</a> that you feel thankful they sound like someone other than White Lies for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you've lived through <a href=""http://www.glasvegas.net/the-world-is-yours/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Glasvegas</a> and such, so you should know the drill by now: guitars whoosh and whir to sound exactly like synthesizers while the actual synthesizer goo provides the empty calories required for nearly every track on <i>Ritual</i> to reach its completely arbitrary five-minute length. The constant hi-hats and thrumming bass are meant to imply some sense of urgent momentum, and the inevitable half-time chorus lets McVeigh over-sing even more. Take all these ingredients, mix them together, and voila-- instant UK buzzband. Hey, I don't make the rules.</p>
<p>I mean really, why White Lies? What vacuum did nature abhor that much? Maybe it's the one where the relatively smaller dimensions of the UK make it possible to believe that typical rock bands can become arena-filling gods from their first single. But in the past two decades, the search for the new Radiohead begat the search for the new Coldplay begat the search for the new Libertines begat the search for the new Franz Ferdinand, and now here we are hoping that someone can perhaps fill the gaping void that would occur if Editors decide to pack it up tomorrow.</p></div>"|15009.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15009-ritual/|2.5|Ian Cohen

Not too long ago, Kentucky-born singer-songwriter Daniel Martin Moore rolled through WXVU Radio in Cincinnati to play a studio session and give an interview. Totally routine. But when Moore sat down at the old Steinway piano they kept in-house, his head and heart went wild. Apparently Moore had been thinking of making a gospel record for sometime, an album comprised of new original material as well as standards he remembered hearing and singing while growing up in Cold Spring. That piano, for whatever reason, brought it all home.</p>
<p>Moore did something smart here: Rather than record straight covers of these songs, he tried to arrange and play them impressionistically, as he remembered them and as shaped by his feelings on spirituality now. In addition, he contributed four similarly inspired gospels songs of his own. The result is a very warm, very welcoming entry point for anyone interested in the gospel tradition. Though this album doesn't remain entirely faithful to the original source material's every layer, it does stay true to the feeling behind that music. That's a very special thing.</p>
<p>It also sounds fantastic. Moore enlisted the help of several of his friends to bring the project into being, two of which are My Morning Jacket's Jim James on banjo (credited here as Yim Yames)  and drummer Daniel Joseph Dorff, who took over at the aforementioned, mystical, nine-foot Steinway that set the project in motion. Everything here sounds as though it was recorded live with minimal overdubs, and though the feel is loose, all these players also sound like they've been playing together for years. Moore has an impossibly soothing voice (former lablemate and tourmate Sam Beam is of a similar feather) and the lighter fare, most of which can be found on the record's first half, can take on a coffee shop/Jack Johnson in Appalachia feel at times.</p>
<p>Shuffles like ""In the Garden"" or Moore's take on Jean Ritchie's ""In the Cool of the Day"" are fully reclined and although they've got a great energy, those songs with a bit more shadow stand out the most. And with the exception of the mandolin-and banjo-laced ""Up Above My Head"", the majority of those songs were authored by Moore. One minute opener ""All Ye Tenderhearted"" is a brief acoustic inhale whose beauty is matched again, but only by the piano and hush of Moore's ""O My Soul"". Lyrically he stitches everything up quietly by referencing the titles and themes of other songs found here, the latter's chorus a nod to the same Jean Ritchie track noted above.</p>
<p>In that vein, the arrangements here are also uniformly gorgeous. But the conceptual framework is a much harder sell considering the Christian backdrop. Personally, I didn't grow up in a house where faith or religion played much of a role, save for a reason for Mom and Dad to argue at dinner (she's Catholic, he's Methodist). But religious music was never a hot button issue, and at no point does this, Moore's latest, feel like anything other than an honest expression of love. And, to close like a nerd as much as anything else: this isn't a headphones listen. It's music with which to fill a room or, even better, a home.</p></div>"|15021.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15021-in-the-cool-of-the-day/|7.7|David Bevan

As other parts come into definition over time, whatever hooked your ear first tends to stick out a little. ""The Eye in the Eye of the Storm"" by newcomer Lady Lazarus, a track that we reviewed last February, is a scarcer breed. From the first listen, you can take it in entirely. There's just a patiently elongated voice, a few shifting lyrics, and a C Major scale arcing up over and over. The scale begins at middle C, the eye of the keyboard, but a couple of slowly revolving chords in a lower octave create external pressure. The lyrics address the storm outside as if it were a house, ""so unbearably quiet."" The song's title, instrumentation, and words are all stabilized on a single conceptual base, but stability is undermined by the uneven tempo.</p>
<p>Appropriately for someone named after a poem, Lady Lazarus is all about the essential, a category that has not included a record label, a notable scene, or much of a public presence. I found out about her when her brother emailed me a brief ""RIYL Beach House"" message. I could hear some Beach House in her MySpace demos, though they reminded me more of early Cat Power or a folksier Grouper. I learned that her name was Melissa Ann Sweat; she lived in San Jose (though has since moved to Georgia) and was working on a proper album. The demos were mostly loose refrains played with a lot of feeling, wreathed in reverb and tape hiss. There was something very natural yet cloistered about the music.</p>
<p>I really liked the songs as they were, and worried that the hazy, magical feeling would be lost in ""better"" recordings. Melissa Ann Sweat had the same concern. She started to polish up <i>Mantic</i>, her debut LP, in a San Jose studio but found the results more ""cold and clinical"" than the home recordings, and she went back to her Fostex four-track. It was the right choice. She plays the atmosphere as much as the song, mostly with a reverb-drenched Yamaha electric keyboard on the grand-piano setting. On songs like ""Took in My Diamond Heart"", overtones gather and beat in elusive patterns<span> </span>around several alternating notes, and every part of the music feels responsive to the moment.</p>
<p>Had Sweat gone with a studio version of <i>Mantic</i>, some songs would've worked great. ""Half-Life"" and ""Midnight Music for a Broken Heart Condition"" fare gorgeously on the strength of Eluvium-like melodies, rather than textural accumulation. The same can't be said of ""Immortal Youth"", which seems mostly an excuse to try out the thumb-piano. But it makes sense in this context, where Sweat shrinks the gap between her everyday life and music to a sliver. The songs are full of places and things that were available to her: ""Half-Life"" was played on an upright piano in a backyard shed, ""Twilight on a Steinway"" in her employer's living room. People, though, are conspicuously absent: Sweat played every note. When she asks, ""Who's gonna sing it but me?"" on ""Eye of the Storm"", it doesn't feel like an idle question. <i>Mantic </i>thrives on the sense of being alone with the last voice in the world. Lots of people use music to try and escape their living rooms, but Lady Lazarus seems more interested in inviting us into hers.</p></div>"|14952.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14952-mantic/|7.8|Brian Howe

That's the kind of stuff we need to be talking about if we're going to call Braids ""dream-pop"" as so many others have. The quartet's bracing debut <i>Native Speaker </i>is almost <i>Inception</i>-like in its warping of reality, equally tactile and dissolute, cerebral and surreal and ultimately haunting for its refusal to answer questions the same way twice.</p>
<p>The Montreal group is constructed like your typical indie rock outfit-- keyboards, guitar, bass, drums, all parties contributing vocals-- but each element is employed in a way that embodies the best ideals of post-rock, where each member coaxes sound like they're trying to learn something new about their instruments at each turn. The same exploratory nature applies to structure-- <i>Native Speaker</i>'s seven roomy compositions (ranging from four to over eight minutes) rely heavily on loops and drones, pinwheels of guitar, and clusters of bell tones. There's constant motion, each layer pushing and prodding until they prop each other into something like stasis, its minimalist bent never drawing too much attention to how it's working <i>really hard</i>.</p>
<p>The loop that drives ""Lemonade"" reads like an EKG, dipping and rising steadfastly as the rhythm section builds a limber, athletic pace and introduces Raphaelle Standell-Preston's intriguing and idiosyncratic vocals. She's not without precedent: tonally there's some RÃ©gine Chassage in her higher register, and her knack for knocking the listener off course with well-placed vulgarity recalls prime-era Jenny Lewis. But the loopy, playful interaction of her and the strange, gripping placidity of <i>Native Speaker </i>feels like something all its own. She's demure as ""Lemonade"" begins but gets more and more unhinged as Braids hurtle forward. Despite the bizarre imagery she sets forth, the song is ultimately an impressionistic commentary on suburban romantic prospects-- ""what I've found is that we're all just sleeping around.""</p>
<p>As <i>Native Speaker </i>truly starts to take shape toward its midsection, you can hear them disassembling ""Lemonade"" only to rebuild each aspect of it into longer forms. It's no discredit to the band that it eases into the record's biggest sounding moments, while amidst the catharsis the vocals do the heavy lifting. ""Glass Deers"" plays it as straight as it gets on <i>Native Speaker</i>: the closest they come to typical strumming and clean guitar lines, while Standell-Preston recalls fellow deconstructionist Sue Tompkins (Life Without Buildings), repeating ""I'm fucked up"" for as much of a percussive effect as an emotional one. Coasting on volume swells and whirring sound effects, the title track finds a point where Braids capture a woozy warmth not far removed from a more tactile take on Animal Collective circa <i>Feels</i>. But within what could scan like post-coital calm, the lyrics drop their often coy logic puzzles for about as straightforward of a cry for sexual need and desire as you'll hear in indie rock.</p>
<p>Immediately thereafter, ""Lammicken"" deeply upsets the mood and throws <i>Native Speaker </i>into a stark relief. ""I can't stop it,"" Standell-Preston repeats as she navigates a hall of funhouse mirrors with only that line to comfort her, her vocals warping and rising. <i>Native Speaker </i>tails off slightly thereafter almost out of necessity, yet it reaches a fitting conclusion with the distant drones of instrumental ""Little Hand"". <i>Native Speaker </i>is by nature elliptical, never seeking out a final word even as it converses with itself, almost as if it's meant to be played as a loop, something that can begin as soon as it ends.</p></div>"|15004.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15004-native-speaker/|7.9|Ian Cohen

Rock'n'roll will likely always have both bands that sound like Led Zeppelin and bands that absorbed Led Zeppelin but marched proudly in an unforeseen direction. Country music has chicken grease-and-cheap beer adherents in addition to pop crossover darlings, while rap brims with boom-bap purists and backpacking sonic explorers. These divisions are rarely as evident or amusing as they are in the world of guitar instrumentalists, a realm where either <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/1437-john-fahey/"" target=""_blank"">John Fahey</a> is some sanctified combination of Zeus, Athena, and Poseidon or the brilliant dude who has become annoying because he's the only touchstone most people have. You either fully embrace Fahey-- like, say, the late <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3669-jack-rose/"" target=""_blank"">Jack Rose</a>-- or you run the other way, like Ben Chasny with his work as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3807-six-organs-of-admittance/"" target=""_blank"">Six Organs of Admittance</a>. A middle ground exists, certainly, but it's rarely been claimed with the grace and elocution of <i>Behold the Spirit</i>, the debut from young Nashville guitarist <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/historyismystery"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">William Tyler</a>. Arguably the most vital, energized album by an American solo guitarist in a decade or more, it accepts Fahey's legacy while escaping its shadow. Moreover, it's simply a joy to hear.</p>
<p>You might recognize Tyler's name from his long stint as a multi-instrumentalist in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/2417-lambchop/"" target=""_blank"">Lambchop</a>, or from album credits alongside <a href=""http://charlielouvin.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Charlie Louvin</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/351-bonnie-prince-billy/"" target=""_blank"">Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/3786-silver-jews/"" target=""_blank"">Silver Jews</a>, and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4664-wooden-wand/"" target=""_blank"">Wooden Wand</a>. Lambchop's oeuvre should give you some hint as to what makes Tyler special. Just as Lambchop's pan-American indie incorporates soul, rock, country and outsider music into one weirdly warped mold, Tyler integrates a dozen different approaches. He's as comfortable with an electric as an acoustic, as accomplished conducting a long, coruscated drone as he is gliding through fingerpicked hymns. The English folk of Pentangle and the American hum of Tom Carter are clear references, as are Indian ragas and Appalachian ballads. Unlike the work of fellow polyglot Sir Richard Bishop, though, Tyler engages all of those muses at once, consistently folding them into surprising revelations.</p>
<p><i>Behold the Spirit</i> is a sterling mixture of bravado and dexterity. Tyler could be an ace in any rock band, so crafted are his chops and developed is his taste. During the elegant climber ""Missionary Ridge"", Tyler winds through a complex circuit of melodies and variations with perfect clarity, the low notes resonating and the high ones shimmering resplendently. ""The Green Pastures"" feels like some sort of tantric test of his skill, as Tyler picks the notes from a handful of chords while an ace country band-- pedal steel, then drums, then piano-- threads melodies and tones through the lines of his acoustic. His guitar always prevails. But if technique were enough to recommend an instrumentalist, we could all save a lot of money on records by applying for a job at Guitar Center. Tyler tempers his skills with patience and ease, delivering these winding passages with unimpeachable composure. ""Tears and Saints"" for instance, is a rugged waltz for electric guitar that depends as much on the rests as it does on the notes. Tyler takes his time with the tune, giving each phrase time to radiate.</p>
<p>The nine numbers collected here never, however, feel like expressions of Tyler's skill. Rather, each feels like its own compositional springboard, where Tyler's guitar simply happens to take the lead. Each of these pieces seems to suggest a story, too, whether through the arc of its music or the sound of its instruments. Opener ""Terrace of the Leper King"" admittedly keys on flurries of acoustic guitar notes, but the song peaks when a chorus of horns and fiddle wail between guitar breaks. It sounds like quiet conquest. In ""Oashpe"", a 12-string guitar breaks through the still of field recordings only to create the same atmosphere with a listless but meticulous drift of chords. Tyler takes advantage of that torpor, though, eventually racing ahead, pulling fleet strings of melody from a cloud of overtones. As with the roaring electric drone that follows or the workmanlike acoustic hymn that closes the album, or really like all of <i>Behold the Spirit</i>, both the sounds and the stories they imply are mesmerizing.</p>
<p>Back to the question of icons and iconoclasts among guitar instrumentalists, it's no secret that neither lot courts a very big audience. John Fahey died a legend, sure, but he didn't die a superstar. <i>Behold the Spirit</i> doesn't feel marginal, though; rather, it feels like the sort of album that can achieve crossover success without alienating that core who can hum <a href=""http://www.tompkinssquare.com/max.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Imaginational Anthem""</a> from memory. These spry melodies and generous arrangements are the stuff of pop fantasy, while the reach of Tyler's music offers calling cards for fans of folk and more textural avant garde pieces. <i>Behold the Spirit</i> works as well on a lethargic Sunday afternoon as it does after dark, on headphones in a still space. It's the sort of achievement that acknowledges and challenges the expectations of its form-- and smiles knowingly the whole time. It's iconoclastic, then, just classically so.</p></div>"|14999.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14999-behold-the-spirit/|8.6|Grayson Currin

His autobiographically based program on the FX network, ""Louie"", quickly became a critical and cult hit. The show was renewed for a second season barely a month after its premiere, an especially triumphant verdict for C.K. considering his first starring vehicle,Â ""Lucky Louie"", was cancelled by HBO in 2006 following its freshman campaign. The show's acclaim coincided with increased recognition of C.K.'s stature as a stand-up comedian, the trade he's been plying for over 25 years, culminating in his latest special, <i>Hilarious</i>, becoming the first stand-up comedy film ever accepted into the Sundance Film Festival.</p>
<p>Louis C.K.'s work both onstage and on the small screen is marked by traits common to most great cultural criticism-- an unflinching honesty and an unwillingness to accept society's conventions at face value. On ""Louie"" the show, that fearless deconstructive spirit manifests itself both in the topics C.K. addresses-- homophobia, religious indoctrination, and male violence were just a few issues broached in the first season-- and the structure of the show itself, which eschews traditional sitcom tropes in favor of frequent detours, ruminations, and extended passages that don't even aim for laughs. <i>Hilarious</i>, by contrast, may simply capture C.K. and his microphone, but that doesn't mean his love of needling the status quo has been squelched.</p>
<p>Spotlighting absurdity in the seemingly mundane is a wellspring for comedians, but C.K.'s observations dig deeper than most. Silly asides about the satisfying heft of English pound coins and the varying inflective properties of the word ""Jew"" are goofy fun, but the real meat of <i>Hilarious</i> finds C.K. upbraiding himself and everyone else in America for all of the selfish, deceitful, moronic shit we do every day. C.K. spends a lot of time here excoriating our spoiled, dumbed-down nation-- for its impatience with technology, lazy child-rearing practices, even its overreliance on exaggerated adjectives. These lengthy rants pinpoint some really baffling societal hypocrisies (for instance, that it's considered heinous to hit dogs but not children), yet such generalized grousing doesn't really represent C.K. at his absolute best. His truly brilliant material is always his most deeply personal, the stuff that finds C.K. meticulously exposing his own flaws and failings as a father, husband, and human being, enumerating the world's idiocies and insecurities through a painfully honest account of his own faults.</p>
<p>C.K.'s 2008 stand-up document, <i>Chewed Up</i>, was a masterpiece of wall-to-wall self-deprecation, and <i>Hilarious</i> suffers slightly in comparison only because it's not as relentless with its squirming confessions. Still, there's plenty of hysterical awkwardness here too-- in C.K.'s struggles to meet women now that he's divorced, in his merciless appraisal of his own meager sex appeal, and especially in his affectionately misanthropic attitudes toward his children, culminating on <i>Hilarious</i> in a horrifyingly outrageous scatological scene.</p>
<p>To claim a comedian or other cultural commentator ""says what we're all thinking"" is by now a clichÃ©, yet C.K.'s refusal to shy away from the most awful and destructive thoughts that rattle around in the minds even of decent-hearted people is his greatest strength. What's more, he does it largely without sliding into the bitter smugness that's frequently befallen the likes of Denis Leary, Lewis Black, and David Cross, not to mention he altogether eschews leaning on hip signifiers or knowing pop culture references to help forge an easier connection with his audience, Ã  la Patton Oswalt or Aziz Ansari. C.K. may gripe constantly about his own physical uncomfortableness, but the crown of America's Best Comic fits him perfectly.</p></div>"|15015.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15015-hilarious/|7.8|Joshua Love

With subways, computers, and the Internet, our relationships might become more casual, McCarthy posited, and our encounters less meaningful. But willfully obtuse arrangements and overly intricate tangents often distracted from the themes, however engaging. And really, that's not surprising for a band that shares its multi-instrumentalist Nils Frykdahl (and his stentorian baritone) with mind-trippers Sleepytime Gorilla Museum.</p>
<p>Faun Fables' fifth album, <i>Light of a Vaster Dark</i>, keys on the American prairie tales of writers likes Willa Cather and Laura Ingalls Wilder to explore the role of women in the early American Midwest. That might seem like an unlikely prompt for a band to reinvent itself, but, for Faun Fables, it's just that: <i>Light of a Vaster Dark </i>is as provocative musically as it is thematically, with rhythms and choruses that swell and arrangements that are smart because they stay out of the way. It's a pop reinvention, if you will, for a band whose intentions have often been subsumed by their own ambitions.</p>
<p><i>Light of a Vaster Dark</i> focuses specifically on the annals of women who powered families and generations with their quiet, steadfast labor. ""Keeper of the keys with hidden worth,"" McCarthy sings on the strangely intoxicating ""Housekeeper"". ""A tidy home will inherit the earth."" McCarthy even writes her own old-fashioned work song, ""Hear the Grinder Creak"", a tune that turns the humdrum toil of flour-milling into a sort of survivalist mantra. Listen closely, though, and note the countering undercurrents: Heavily syncopated with handclaps and big drums, the song feels sexually suggestive. But ghastly harmonies and the moaning violin of Meredith Yayanos add a surfeit of foreboding, as though the labor wears on the singer with each cycle of the song.</p>
<p>Indeed, McCarthy's examinations are more intricate than an issue of <i>Good Housekeeping</i>, as she plays on both the passions and perils that such hardscrabble times held for those that lived them. ""Violet"" muses on the seductive powers of Lena Lingard, one of the most intriguing characters in Cather's <i>My Ãntonia</i>, with her deeply colored eyes and her ""laughter, lazy and kind."" The title track, on the other hand, depicts the universe as an eerie, consuming place, where body and soul are eventually surrendered.</p>
<p>During the album's introduction, McCarthy sings a poem she wrote during winter 1998. She treats the invading winter like a new religion, something that changes the fabric of how life is lived. ""It began with the cold/ How it crept up our sleeves,"" she intones, treating each word like drips of water that are nearly too cold to drop. ""Covering the floor/ Making our blankets freeze."" McCarthy uses that same text for ""Hibernation Tales"", the album's closer. In the intro, it's more of a recitative, where the words are sung simply and directly. But during ""Hibernation Tales"", a choir passes each lyric back and forth, repeatedly volleying their wintry realizations. The technique both humanizes and modernizes the esoteric work of Faun Fables. Suddenly, old American tales are pulled into the present.</p>
<p>These long-lost ways of life-- the flour miller, the woman sweeping her dirt floor, the pioneers of open plains-- seem somehow germane. As with <i>The Transit Rider</i>, McCarthy is making a point about our daily life now-- the constant struggle against the elements, our nature, and each other. This time, though, the band at her back gives that point hooks, rhythms, and textures instead, not just tangents. It's a welcome, if obvious, deviation for a band that's finally more than interesting.</p></div>"|15018.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15018-light-of-a-vaster-dark/|7.4|Grayson Currin

When that line is lifted out of its context, it reflects where the Brooklyn-based songwriter is in her career. After spending the entirety of 2010 (and even a sizeable chunk of 2009) building buzz, playing alongside <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27602-real-estate/"" target=""_blank"">Real Estate</a>, and serving as <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/guest-lists/6609-dan-deacon/"" target=""_blank"">Dan Deacon's favorite band</a>, the release of Air Waves' debut serves as a boost to Schneit and her band's already-quick sprint out of the gate.</p>
<p>In context, the lyrics of ""Knock Out"" paint the portrait of love as a boxing match, surveying the opponent (""Can you put all your teeth out/ So we know just how you fight?"") over the vintage bounce of a sock-hop floor-filler. The darker ""Radio"" carves a vignette of the demise of a relationship out of an economy of lyrics, clanging, strummed guitar, and a resilient bassline. Schneit has a weather-beaten alto reminiscent of folk songstresses <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/janahunter"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jana Hunter</a>, <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/bosquebrown"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bosque Brown</a>, and <a href=""http://www.scoutniblett.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Scout Niblett</a>, and her thin but charming voice often strains to hit high notes that are just a hair out of reach.</p>
<p>While ""Humdrum"" takes minimal musical elements and blends them together to create something surprisingly full sounding, ""Sweetness"" succeeds wildly with just two chords. Throughout, <i>Dungeon Dots</i> displays slapdash pop charm; it sometimes feels as though the running times of the songs are the exact length of time it took her to write them, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The rudimentary song structures can get plodding on ""Fort Tilden"", but even then, Schneit manages to add a simplistic-but-infectious element-- in this case, the ""ooh-oohs"" during the chorus-- that carries it over.</p>
<p>There is a sense of melancholy that courses through the fiber of the record, and this is no more apparent than on the two songs that bookend <i>Dungeon Dots</i>. ""Waters"" is a waltz that serves as the highlight of the record, featuring glittery guitar work, sweet spot-hitting harmonies from <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/sharonvanetten"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sharon Van Etten</a>, and some of the album's best lyrics (""Wear your purple shirt, boy/ But blue hangs on your sleeve""). Picking both the saddest and most climactic way to end the record, closer ""Bisous"" starts as a minor-key ballad and turns quickly into a driving climax, evoking a lonely night drive with fog hanging low on the street, while Schneit dejectedly sings, ""We wait for a change, but that change never came."" There is a rawness, both musical and emotional, in the best moments of <i>Dungeon Dots</i>, proving that the simplest ways to communicate feelings are sometimes the most effective.</p></div>"|15011.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15011-dungeon-dots/|6.9|Martin Douglas

Just over a year ago, the Chicago foursome were of the strictly ""lo-fi"" persuasion, stirring up hot, filthy garage-rock candy out of Marc Bolan and Beatles signifiers. It was youthful music in feeling and sound-- their noisy full-length  debut was recorded while they were still in high school-- but the remarkable hooks buried therein were clear enough to land them on the increasingly stacked Fat Possum roster. And suddenly, they had a studio budget the likes of which they definitely hadn't enjoyed before. Though the leap is audibly huge, <i>Dye It Blonde</i>'s many successes aren't wholly the result of its gilded production values and ambition. This band was able to furnish first-class melodies from the beginning. Now they've grown along with their resources.</p>
<p>You can hear the progress right away in ""Imagine, Pt. 3"", a song originally released as part of a split 7"" in April 2010. Sped up here just a touch, it's also been re-outfitted with a far creamier set of synths and guitars. The way the latter seem to clasp hands during the coda is particularly breathtaking, frontman Cullen Omori and guitarist Max Kakacek letting their individual lines mate rather than duel. While the melodic foundation was already sturdy throughout, here, what once sounded ragged in stretches is now plush-upholstered from start to finish. Every single piece of<i> Dye It Blonde</i> is similarly decadent, whether it's the sweet whine of semi-titular closer ""Dye the World"" or the twilight jangle of ""End of the Night"".</p>
<p>In an interview not long after the album's completion, Omori noted that this otherwise new set of songs was influenced by 90s Britpop luminaries like Oasis, Teenage Fanclub, and Suede. All are present sonically and spiritually, be it in brash tones, melodic IQ or the sheer scope of these recordings. Where a Smith Westerns hook may have once sounded like another fuzzy member of the Nuggets family/genus, it now unfolds like crane-shot, mainstage festival fare. ""Still New"" for example floats some phasered guitar interplay before Kakacek rips a hole across the chest of the song with a woozy line so big it essentially serves as a chorus. Like ""Weekend"", whose central, hair-flipping lick also hugs all its parts together perfectly, the song just sounds so <i>drunk</i>-- drunk on love, drunk on heavy petting, drunk on drink, or maybe just drunk on a some combination of the above. In song, it all depends on the lean of Omori's voice and the whip of his chord changes, the curves of his brother Cameron's bass lines.</p>
<p>That moony/beery-eyed feel bleeds through every corridor of this album and in turn forms a crystalline expression of what moves this band. Their use of the studio in augmenting that never goes overboard, though: this music still retains the innately psychedelic, lamplit, tongue-kissed sense of atmosphere that set it apart. There's perhaps no better instance of all that than ""All Die Young"", the album's centerpiece. It's a ballad turned hymn whose grand, tumbling scale and ""Oh Yoko""-indebted outro celebration are peaks on an album rich in them. In its closing moments, Omori sings what sounds like, ""Love is lovely when you are young."" They were convincing before, but now they seem like experts.</p></div>"|15016.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15016-dye-it-blonde/|8.4|David Bevan

Released on Actress' Werk Discs, the record contained a wide range of in-vogue sonic elements: humid Dilla-stepped beats, filmic vocal samples, and the beatific tape-warp wooziness of Boards of Canada. Cutler's creation was a stylistic cousin to Bibio, another BoC acolyte with an ear for Dilla. But it was also rough around the edges and disjointed. <i>Ecstasy</i> was a forward-thinking record, but also one that wasn't fully realized, so it's not too surprising that it didn't really catch on.</p>
<p>Cutler's follow-up, <i>Emerald Fantasy Tracks</i>, doesn't suffer from the same underdeveloped tendencies. Issued on his own Magic Wire Recordings imprint, the record represents a clean break from his past. Were it not for the name on the album cover, you'd be forgiven for thinking it was made by an entirely different artist. The sticky tropical atmosphere and knack for sentimental melodies are still there, but gone are the loping, static-riddled boom-bap beats. Instead, Culter offers jackknifing tempos and clattering 808s that recall 1990s breakbeat techno at its giddiest (think Underground Resistance's <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQv3dCkY2Tk"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Jupiter Jazz""</a>), all of which adds up to an album that is dense but immediately engaging.</p>
<p>You get the feeling that Cutler has inhaled 15 years' worth of dance music in the year since his last full-length. This is no history lesson, though-- the music has too much of an emotional pull for that, as Cutler puts his ear for BoC's pitch-drunk melodies to good use. He has a weird knack for arranging clusters of sound to make them feel slow, unstable, and psychedelic. So the perceived speed of neck-whipped cuts like ""Aquamarine"" and the album's prismatic highlight, ""Petrcane Beach Track"", feel oddly off, even while the BPMs stay firmly in place. It's a trick that he puts to use carefully, and its application is disorienting in the most blissful sense.</p>
<p>It's that care and attention to detail that makes <i>Emerald Fantasy Tracks</i> more of an album and less of a grouping of similar cuts. The pacing is sharp, from the album's percolating, Eastern-influenced midsection to the downtempo, affecting closer ""The Birds Don't Fly This High"". Tech-y enough for beatheads but with a direct melodic sense that will appeal to even the most casual of electronic music observers, <i>Emerald Fantasy Tracks</i> is just as thrilling and sensual as the album title suggests, transcending nostalgia and instead drawing a drum-programmed path straight to the human heart.</p></div>"|14998.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14998-emerald-fantasy-tracks/|8.3|Larry Fitzmaurice

Where their mix of Velvet Underground chug and krautrock groove on 2010 debut <i>Lux</i> was pretty melodic, on <i>Guider</i> they're more interested in being hypnotic. They've embraced repetition, using it as an end of its own rather than a way to find hooks. They do offer lots to latch onto-- memorable riffs abound, and revving tempos propel the tunes like a car stuck in 5th gear. But they sound more into straight lines than catchy arcs, more into the moment than what came before.</p>
<p>The recording details confirm that immediacy. According to Kranky's press release, all but one track is a first take. In fact, Disappears literally erased the past, recording over tapes originally used for the <i>Lux</i> sessions. Still, for an album so in-the-moment and so short-- it lasts only 30 minutes, and half is taken up by closer ""Revisiting""-- <i>Guider</i> doesn't fly by. All the repetition distorts the sense of time, as if each groove had begun before tape rolled and continued to churn past the end.</p>
<p>That aligns Disappears with another band that can turn one riff into an eternal swing, San Francisco's Wooden Shjips. Both also draw openly on classic influences-- Disappears' twitter bio is ""Music for Record Collectors""-- and this time around the common denominator is Spacemen 3. That group's rumbling bass, reflective guitar, and flattened vocals spring up in the quiet/loud drama of ""Not Romantic"", the stair-climbing ""Superstition"", and the shivering riffs of ""Halo"". But Spacemen 3 weren't unique-- they borrowed as much from Suicide and the MC5 as Disappears borrow from them-- and their influence on <i>Guider</i> produces something that can't simply be called a copy.</p>
<p>A more valid criticism would be that heavy influence makes <i>Guider</i> less able to transcend genre than the more openly catchy <i>Lux</i>. For me, the band makes up for that deficit in sheer magnetic energy, which isn't easy to wrangle from such a well-worn style. That energy is plentiful enough that Disappears may yet make a record that captures both true believers and recent converts equally.</p></div>"|14988.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14988-guider/|7.0|Marc Masters

It should have been the album to reverse David Banner's creative slide. But instead of hellfire righteousness over back-to-basics bangers, we got 10 tracks heavy on drippy love raps, dumbly repetitive hooks, and beats suspiciously lacking in thump-value.</p>
<p>Banner made a splash with 2003's <i>Mississippi: The Album</i>, a fascinating mix of amoral thugging and mournful moralizing. After that he mostly ditched the interesting side of his persona-- erudite everyman torn between Southern pride and sorrow over the down-and-out realities of Southern life-- in search of BEP-level hits. This quixotic quest reached an ugly apotheosis with 2008's <i>The Greatest Story Ever Told</i>, where the few moments of politicized rage were smothered and made facile by the icky, half-assed attempts to keep up with the Auto-Tuned Joneses.</p>
<p>In that light, even the title, <i>Death of a Pop Star</i>, seemed promising, a chance for Banner to disavow his attempts to create top-selling ringtones and get back to the fury that once made him one of the quasi-mainstream's most interesting figures. The duo maybe even went into the studio intending to make their <i>Illmatic</i>: a dose of classicist rap intensity, one MC going hard over no-filler beats. What they turned out instead is, like all of Banner's albums since <i>Mississippi</i>, a muddled hybrid of styles that clash more often than they mesh. Many tracks have an awkwardly smooth R&amp;B vibe that diffuses Banner's decidedly non-smooth energy. And Banner's version of ""soul rap,"" his emotionally naked bluesy drawl, was already a hundred times more interesting than the antiseptic pop-soul stabs on <i>Death</i>, tracks like ""Slow Down"" which have as much grit as the Ace of Base tunes the song's hook recalls.</p>
<p>The album as a whole is as overloaded with guest stars as the way longer <i>Greatest Story Ever Told</i>. True, <i>Death of a Pop Star</i> displays better taste in collaborations than Banner's last few albums. But what's the point of snagging Erykah Badu instead of Chris Brown if you're going to task her with a chorus as inane as ""and I get real silly?"" Throughout <i>Death</i> decent singers and rappers keep showing up to drop dashed-off hooks in what feels like a rather desperate attempt to turn these slickly produced loops into honest-to-god songs. And speaking of loops: Though 9th Wonder cements his well-earned rep for spotting the perfect fluttery soul samples to color a track, the actual beats on <i>Death</i> are mostly slight, skittery things, lacking the low-end force that made folks like Pete Rock and Dilla heroes to folks other than crate-diggers.</p>
<p>Lyrically, the album's a mess. Banner's obviously a smart guy, but as soon as he starts kicking game his IQ seems to drop about 40 points. Entry-level come-ons like ""Stutter""-- ""look at your hips, look at your physique, you're so fine from behind girl, I be scared to speak""-- mark him as one of rap's least convincing lotharios. The saddest thing is that ""Stutter"" is Banner's flow at his best on <i>Death</i>, nimble in a way makes you wish he had something meatier to sink his skills into. And the few moments of overt social comment on <i>Death</i> feel like a pastiche of Banner's older, more committed songs. ""They call it the trap because most hoods is just that"" is the kind of water-weak insight you could expect from the most apolitical gangsta, but worse, Banner just doesn't sound as pained, engaged, or enraged as he once did on songs like ""Mississippi"" or ""Fire Falling"".</p>
<p>There are moments throughout <i>Death of a Pop Star</i> that suggest the better album that might have resulted with a little more focus and intensity. You still hope Banner gets there again eventually; he's too odd and talented, too much his own man, to wind up an also-ran in hip-hop history.</p></div>"|15005.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15005-death-of-a-pop-star/|5.8|Jess Harvell

You'd be right to be skeptical of Portishead's Geoff Barrow linking up with another European singer with a deadpan, dramatic voice, but <i>Anika</i> isn't an attempt to capitalize on past glories. Instead, it's a further delving into Barrow's record-nerd fantasies after 2009's krautrock-isms with his band, Beak&gt;. Recorded quickly, and live, <i>Anika</i> preens like high art but eventually reveals itself as a loving and minor pet project.</p>
<p>Barrow and the rest of Beak&gt; back Anika, a Berlin/Bristol-based journalist who stumbles and fusses with a Nico-like charm. She doesn't have a fantastic voice, but she's patient and plays a very specific role-- the emotionally detached European chanteuse-- without ego. That's key too, because this type of muse-pop is usually conducted in the interest of star-making (see: Nico, Brigitte Bardot). Anika and Beak&gt; instead focus on teasing the emotional intricacies out of old songs and styles by pairing them with rougher, niche sonics. The majority of the tracks on <i>Anika</i> are covers, leaning heavily on 1960s pop and folk.</p>
<p>Beak&gt; augment Anika's droll talk/sing with a dubby, beat-driven noir that borrows from minimal wave's chunky rhythms and post-punk's spindly verve. ""Terry"" and ""End of the World"" transform teenage naÃ¯vetÃ© into lingering fear, though the group is better when the strangeness of the material-- Yoko Ono's ""Yang Yang""-- is on par with the music's obscure referents. (An exception: an airy, organ-led rendition of Ray Davies' ""I Go to Sleep"" closes the album on its most tender note.) The group's two original productions-- the paranoid ""No One's There"" and the punky ""Officer Officer""-- are lyrically tenser than their counterparts and not as rewarding, but they allow Beak&gt; to build some noisy, industrial momentum. The group's biggest and most prevalent misstep is a seven-minute cover of Bob Dylan's ""Masters of War"" (never Dylan's most tuneful or clever song), one they repeat with a dub version (this begs the question: do dub-leaning bands really need dub edits?). Beak&gt; turn it into a call-and-response bass epic but can't escape its ham-fisted politics, however fitting they must seem.</p>
<p>It's tempting to accuse Barrow of formalism-- <i>Anika</i> sounds just that familiar-- but he's earned the right, and moreover, the treatments here are clever and well executed. Beak&gt;'s productions will jar and quiver in a good pair of headphones, and Anika presents herself as a faithful cipher rather than a Brand New Talent. <i>Anika</i> is shortsighted in the best way: it's a tribute, an exercise, the charming kind.</p></div>"|15014.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15014-anika/|6.5|Andrew Gaerig

<p>Whether the Decemberists are actually any nerdier than, say, Animal Collective isn't worth arguing-- the ambition is the thing, and the Decemberists reached a gumption apex on 2009's <i>The Hazards of Love</i>, a proggy rock opera based loosely on an EP by the British folk singer Anne Briggs. The record follows the story of a woman who falls in love with a shape-shifting creature she meets in the woods; there's forest-sex, spells, an overbearing queen, and plenty of thick, quasi-metal guitar. As an antidote of sorts, the band comes back with <i>The King Is Dead</i>, a breezy country-folk record with no discernable narrative. The concept here-- wait for it-- is that there is no concept.</p>
<p>Recorded in a converted barn on Oregon's Pendarvis Farm, <i>The King Is Dead</i> eschews the high, mystical wailing of British folk for its North American counterpart. Rustic and roomy, the record nods to Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris, early Wilco, the Band, Neil Young, and especially R.E.M. In places, it almost feels like a disrobing: ""Let the yoke fall from our shoulders,"" frontman Colin Meloy bellows on opener ""Don't Carry It All"", his voice loose and easy, freer than he's sounded in an awfully long time.</p>
<p>Meloy is an established fan of certain strains of Americana music, and he's enlisted a few inimitable guests: R.E.M.'s Peter Buck plays on three tracks, Gillian Welch sings on seven, and Welch's songwriting partner, the guitarist Dave Rawlings, appears every so often as a backing vocalist. There are moments when the record's twang can feel a little overcooked (the Decemberists have never been great at spontaneity, exactly), but there's an interesting tension between the inherent unpretentiousness of country music-- it's rural, it's populist, it's based in universal emotions-- and the Decemberists' literary cartwheeling. So while there's still plenty of fussy wordplay (""Hetty Green/ Queen of supply-side bonhomie bone-drab,"" Meloy bleats in ""Calamity Song"") and at least one <i>Infinite Jest</i> joke, there are also loads of simple, rousing choruses. In the past, Meloy's ability to write a sweet, memorable melody has occasionally gotten lost, but on <i>King</i>, his songwriting shines.</p>
<p>A few tracks feel like homage (""Down By the Water"" is an easy analogue of ""The One I Love"", while ""All Arise!"" seems to repurpose bits of ""Honky Tonk Women""), but mostly they're solid showcases for the band's best features: On the exquisitely pastoral (and guest-free) ""January Hymn"", Meloy sings about time and snow (""April all an ocean away/ Is this the better way to spend the day?"") while Chris Funk adds the tiniest bit of octave guitar to Meloy's acoustic strums.</p>
<p>For all its rural pedigrees,<i> The King Is Dead</i> is still a clean and meticulously crafted album; the production is smooth and the performances are unnervingly error-free. Consequently, it's missing a little vulnerability-- the best Americana records tend to feel a little lawless, but the Decemberists just can't quite relinquish control.</p></div>"|15000.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15000-the-king-is-dead/|7.2|Amanda Petrusich

London trio Klaxons found themselves in the holiday spirit as well, capping off a year that finally saw their long-awaited second album, <i>Surfing the Void</i>, by posting an unreleased EP for free on their website. Recorded in 2008<i>, Landmarks of Lunacy </i>chronicles ""three nocturnal weeks spent at Black Box studio"" following the release of their Mercury Prize-winning debut, <i>Myths of the Near Future</i>. Helmed by <i>Myths </i>producer James Ford,<i> Landmarks of Lunacy </i>sheds light on the daunting process of trying to follow a hot debut album.</p>
<p>Grander in scope and more anthemic than their debut, <i>Surfing the Void</i> was a solid, engaging next step for the band. <i>Landmarks of Lunacy</i> acts as the connecting piece in the attempt to grow and remain relevant. The only problem is that the music itself is watery and wholly unmemorable. As the band struggled to find a new, more mature sound, they clumsily opted for safe routes at nearly every turn.</p>
<p>Klaxons spend most of the EP spinning their wheels, lazily plodding through the motions and failing to conjure any of the colorful imagery that marked their debut. Here was a band that once thrived off a unique, kinetic energy, so to find them aimlessly forcing psych textures and indulging in unfocused Britpop wanderings (presented lethargically and totally unmixed) is a real disappointment. Despite their ambrosial quality, ""The Pale Blue Dot"" and ""Silver Forest"" are simply half-formed, failing to achieve the far-out, cosmic feel they were going for.</p>
<p>The best part about <i>Landmarks of Lunacy</i> is knowing that things would eventually get better for Klaxons, and that a trepidatious toe-dip into the unknown is simply part of the record-making process. So it's ultimately frivolous to beat up on these five songs too much, especially considering the guys were nice enough to just hand these tracks over. In fact, two of them might even be granted an extended stay on your hard drive: ""Wildeflowers"" feels like a smoky, sinister answer to ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", and ""Marble Fields"", which could have been a minor <i>Surfing the Void</i> cut, sways dangerously, both frazzled and silky all at once. <i>Landmarks of Lunacy</i> should be regarded as a souvenir for Klaxons obsessives only. For the rest of us, well, at least the price is right.</p></div>"|14992.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14992-landmarks-of-lunacy-ep/|5.7|Zach Kelly

Starting out as a collaboration spanning almost the entire length of North America (co-principal Jasmine White-Glutz briefly took up residence in Los Angeles, while Laura Lloyd remained in Montreal), the duo sent tracks back and forth, and Mexican Summer eventually picked them up after hearing two songs on their MySpace page. Before long, White-Glutz moved back home, the band was praised by the always-enthusiastic Bethany Cosentino (whose tweet referred to No Joy as, ""the best band ever""), expanded to a quartet, and recorded their debut album, all in less than a year after forming. Whoever says that long-distance relationships never work out should take <i>Ghost Blonde</i> for a spin.</p>
<p>Distance is an ideal that seeps into the pores of every guitar strum and snare hit on the record. Lloyd and White-Glutz's airy vocals are pushed low into the mix, to the point where their voices resemble conversation from a foggy, half-remembered dream. The guitars, loud enough to obliterate everything within 50 yards, create a balmy atmosphere where lacerating riffs and blurry strumming shares face time with ear-piercing feedback. And this noise becomes just as much of a compositional tool as the actual notes summoned from their six-strings.</p>
<p>Filing <i>Ghost Blonde</i> as shoegaze would be reductive, as the reference base is deeper than most of today's bands who work in that template. Lush, My Bloody Valentine, the Breeders, Sonic Youth, and even traces of Hole can be picked up from No Joy's sometimes-melancholy, sometimes-violent sounds. And while the list of references draws heavily from the 90s, the band displays a very uncommon sense of originality. ""You Girls Smoke Cigarettes?"" is a bass-driven tune with an addictive slurry chant during the verses and a chorus that explodes with harmony, followed by a destructive climax, breakdown, and bridge, all in just a little over two minutes. ""Still"" is an 80 MPH push featuring ethereal vocals not even trying to rise above the careening, bleating guitars that ping-pong all over the track. ""Indigo Child"" and ""Pacific Pride"" temper the righteous noise of the aforementioned songs. The former is a glacial stride into sadder territory offset by the low rumbling of noise that eventually reaches a crescendo by the end of the track, and the latter tests the band's sense of dynamics and succeeds wildly.</p>
<p>""Distance"" can be a pejorative term, as if the fact that certain things can't be held at a close range can feel defeating. But while <i>Ghost Blonde</i> can feel like it's keeping the listener at arm's length, further listens reveal a record full of vibrancy, the kind in which you soon find yourself fully immersed.</p></div>"|14929.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14929-ghost-blonde/|7.7|Martin Douglas

A fan can't really ask for much more than that. What started as a Three Mile Pilot side project focused on doleful, monochromatic dirges blossomed into something more substantial, peaking with an excellent pair of albums that expanded the band's approach and conceptual framework: 2002's <i>Amore Del Tropico</i> and 2006's <i>The Spell</i>. There's a degree to which the only thing the band could do after that was consolidate its gains, and that's what <i>Six</i> did in 2009-- it was satisfying, but it was also the first album in the band's career that didn't expand what the Black Heart Procession could be.</p>
<p><i>Blood Bunny / Black Rabbit</i> doesn't do anything to reclaim the band's momentum. It's a textbook placeholder EP: three new songs and a clutch of five remixes that range from inconsequential to annoying. The thing that makes it worth a visit for fans is the fact that two of those new songs are truly excellent. The propulsive, mostly instrumental ""Blank Page"" is a curious inclusion here. With its succession of distinct melodic themes and instrumental textures, it feels like the overture to a conceptual work along the lines of <i>Amore Del Tropico</i>. The band could probably build a good album off of it, actually-- I hope it isn't left to languish here. The other standout is ""Devotion"", one of the band's best songs to date. It builds off a chant-like vocal before dropping into a dark, slippery bass groove, and it balances inherently hyperbolic, melodramatic lyrics like ""you rip out my guts"" with understated instrumental breaks that temper its out-of-control emotional content.</p>
<p>If those two songs were the meat of an album, we'd really have something, but of course that's not the case. ""The Orchid"" is nearly a retreat to the band's early dirge days, and two remixes of <i>Six</i>'s ""Drugs"" by Eluvium and Jamuel Saxon, respectively, add little to the song. One merely makes it a longer, dronier instrumental, while the other adds a beat. They're fine as remixes go but not essential listening. Much more puzzling is the Lee ""Scratch"" Perry psych-dub freakout that follows ""Devotion"". It has its moments of shivering psych appeal, but the opening, in which Perry meows like a cat and mumbles, is irritating, and I say that as someone who likes a lot of Lee Perry's music. Mr. Tube basically just makes ""Heaven Below"" less interesting, while ""Silence"" (also a Mr. Tube joint) comes off like an attempt to recast BHP as Einsturzende Neubauten Jr. Mr. Tube is actually an interesting project (in which Pall Jenkins of BHP sings and produces), but these tracks aren't the best introduction to it.</p>
<p>I generally don't expect a stopgap EP to have any consistency of vision or direction, and this is true to that expectation. Oddly, it's continuously mixed so that all of these incongruous tracks flow seamlessly into one another as though they were conceived together. Let's be honest, though: You can pretty easily grab ""Blank Page"" and ""Devotion"" and leave the rest. And for those two songs alone, <i>Blood Bunny / Black Rabbit</i> is at least a worthwhile entry in the BHP catalog, if not one you'll need to hear all the way through more than once.</p></div>"|15002.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15002-blood-bunny-black-rabbit/|5.9|Joe Tangari

What's more remarkable about Bill Orcutt's stylistic transformation is that it comes after a decade of dormancy. His inimitable electric guitar sound-- a brittle howl akin to knives breaking glass-- was silenced by the late-1990s demise of his notorious noise trio, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/27097-harry-pussy/"">Harry Pussy</a>. But in 2009, after starting a family and a career, he picked up an old acoustic he's owned since college and channeled his muse into raw improvisations equally indebted to blues legends like Lightnin' Hopkins and abstract experimenters like Derek Bailey.</p>
<p>Those might not be the first names that come to mind when you hear the word ""noise."" But on two self-released 2009 records-- a two-song 7"" and a six-song LP, both packaged here by Editions Mego with four unreleased tracks-- Orcutt uses such inspirations to create acoustic cacophony that retains all the trademark rattles and blasts of his electric playing. That's partially due to his instrument, a vintage acoustic so fragile that its four strings have to be wound loose or the neck will break. This gives the guitar a brittle, steely quality that Orcutt mines for all kinds of racket.</p>
<p>But there's also noise inherent in his methods-- his way of attacking and diving into his ideas-- which has been there since he first started playing. As he told me in a recent ""<a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/the-out-door/7858-the-out-door-7/2/"">Out Door"" interview</a>, ""Once I actually have a guitar in my hands, I think I disappear into the same black hole that I was disappearing into when I was 15."" On <i>A New Way to Pay Old Debts</i>, he rips out sharp plucks, strums in blurry bursts, and strangles his strings as if they were a threat. His playing is so urgent and exhaustive, you get the sense that he could coax blare from a feather.</p>
<p>Not that everything here is noise. Orcutt mixes in minimalist repetitions and quieter passages, owing as much to pianists Glenn Gould and Cecil Taylor as to his guitar forefathers. He also adds atmospheric textures (you can hear a phone ring on opener ""Lip Rich"") and wordless singing, similar to Loren Connors' hums and moans on his early acoustic records. When Orcutt barks in time to his buzzing chops on ""My Reckless Parts"" or melds his shriek into ""High Waisted"", he sounds roughly like Connors sped up and set on fire.</p>
<p>Which means this album is a challenging listen, even when it's not noisy. If you're not inclined toward acoustic improvisation or unstructured abstraction, Orcutt won't change your mind. But anyone can admire the raw soul of his playing and the way he shoots out ideas in real-time, reacting so quickly it's as if he's creating a new language as he speaks it. Either way, it's impossible to listen to <i>A New Way to Pay Old Debts </i>without being affected by it.</p></div>"|14989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14989-a-new-way-to-pay-old-debts/|8.0|Marc Masters

The biggest musical export from Huntsville last year, however, was Antoine Dodson and the Gregory Brothers' <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMtZfW2z9dw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Bed Intruder Song""</a>, an embarrassing local news clip turned Internet meme that inexplicably hit the Billboard Hot 100.</p>
<p>On<i> The ONE... COHESIVE</i>, G-Side rapper ST 2 Lettaz, the braying, bold contrast to partner Yung Clova's raspy skepticism, makes two purposefully crude references to Antoine Dodson. ""Never"" features a dismissive aside (""tampons for you Antoines"") and on ""Came Up"", he warns rappers, ""like the Lincoln Park rapist, I'm comin' through your window."" ST's ire stems from Dodson's complicity in presenting Huntsville as another backwoods hood (G-Side calls it <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2010/12/30/132437550/g-side-dreaming-of-a-practical-life"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""a mini Memphis""</a> for good reason). But Dodson's use of the web to make a better life for himself and his family is probably something G-Side can get behind.</p>
<p>These guys rap excitedly about blog love with the same joy they do when they talk about, say, not working at the gas station anymore, or the ""couple thou"" they get for shows these days. This isn't because they're self-satisfied knuckleheads who don't see the bigger picture, but because, as far as they're concerned, right now their doggedly D.I.Y. come-up is all that matters. Tellingly, a highlight from <i>COHESIVE</i> is titled ""Inner Circle"".</p>
<p>And then there are the beats. On <i>Starshipz &amp; Rocketz</i> and <i>Huntsville International</i>, the production from in-house beatmakers the Block Beattaz mixed Southern thump and rave-rap experimentalism. Those records sounded like a logical but bold extension of the Dungeon Family aesthetic of the late 1990s. For <i>COHESIVE</i>, the Block Beattaz and likeminded producers A-Team, Str8 Drop, Clams Casino, the Basmo Family, and DJ Burn One create expansive, next-level compositions as audacious as G-Side's raps are modest. It's a strange combination-- big, lush beats and stories about small victories-- but it turns songs that are celebratory of simple things (a girl sending sexy cell-phone pictures, visiting Paris for the first time) or full of thoughtful sentiments (supporting family, helping community) into something epic.</p>
<p>Each grandiose beat is stuffed full of pained, joyful catharsis like the music scoring one of those big ""Aha!"" moments in a heady sci-fi flick. Seriously, some creative kids with extra time on their hands should set homemade montages to this album and stick them up on YouTube: the Coldplay pianos and spacey drum'n'bass of ""Y U Mad"" to Darren Aronofsky's <i>The Fountain</i>, maybe, or ""Inner Circle""'s stormy bursts of synths and strings to <i>Inception</i>. And there's a steady build-up to these beautiful beats, with every song playing a crucial part in soundtracking ST and Clova's scrappy triumphs: ""Nat Geo"" propels the album forward, ever so slightly, and ""Never"" shoots the album into hyperspace, redirecting its energies for a thoughtful finale.</p>
<p>Despite precious references to the Internet and more than enough mini-myth-making, G-Side remain painfully aware of the blog hype echo chamber. On ""Y U Mad"", ST asks, ""if everyone's a star, then who gonna be the audience?"" and Clova grounds the track with an affecting end-run around competition: ""Niggas jealous? I'm just trying to feed my fam."" ""MoneyInTheSkyII"", a sequel to a song G-Side released for free last spring (and put together while on tour in Norway), finds the group questioning whether they should continue the independent route, get a regular job, or just return to hustling. Even on their most accomplished, comfortable album, G-Side don't forget this rap shit is complicated.</p></div>"|14976.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14976-the-one-cohesive/|8.1|Brandon Soderberg

It's a pale imitation of God's creation of Adam-- close but not quite, because a golem has no free will and can only obey commands. In the most popular version of the myth, a rabbi in Prague creates a golem to protect the city's Jews from persecution, but the monster grows violent and out of control. This golem is a forefather of Frankenstein's monster, a parable about the power and pitfalls of playing god, or really, of any creative endeavor. The things you birth can get away from you; they can take on lives of their own.</p>
<p><i>The Golem: How He Came Into the World</i> is a 1920 silent film version of the popular story (traditionally, golems also can't speak, which makes them an ideal subject for the pre-talkie era). Lately, film festivals and musicians have made a nice sideline of presenting live scores to such movies, and in 2008, prolific Pixes frontman Black Francis composed a soundtrack to <i>The Golem</i> for the San Francisco International Film Festival. That score was released in a limited run of 500 as a 5xCD set comprising the live performance, studio recordings, and a DVD of the film synched to the soundtrack. (Along with the Pixies' retrospective <i>Minotaur</i>, Francis seems to be developing a thing for monsters and box sets.) Now, Francis has boiled the material down to <i>The Golem Rock Album</i>, a relatively lean, hour-long set of 18 songs whose title suggests that we judge the record as a stand-alone entity. No film screening necessary.</p>
<p>And it is a rock album, as far out from the Prague ghetto as you'd expect Francis to take it-- less old-world beer-hall or chamber music than new weird Americana. The album opens with the familiar, spaced-out surf guitar strum of ""Miriam and Florian Theme (Version 2)"" but quickly descends into more raucous territory. This golem doesn't lumber and skulk so much as swagger and be-bop and damn near line-dance. Sure, there are vestigial strings and harpsichord and even a waltz, but they're secondary to guitars that range from acoustic strum to western twang to fried bluesy leads-- and to a saxophone that blows through some songs with Morphine-grade melancholy and rips up others with sputtering free-jazz bleat and squeal.</p>
<p>Then there's Francis' multivalent yet unmistakable voice. On ""Miriam and Florian"", it's that old seductive whine, always just holding back a growl, hiding its teeth. In the final seconds of ""Astaroth"", he lets it loose, grumbling guttural gibberish and capping the song with three quick, strangulated yips. On ""The Maharal"", it's pleasantly weathered and hoarse, and elsewhere, it's a low, emotive croon, richer for its years.</p>
<p>The album's lyrics reference the absent film in ways both obvious and obscure. ""Meet Me at the Ghetto Gates"" is the song that feels most like it was meant for a musical or a rock opera, with its waltz time and its simple, potentially plot-advancing lyrical refrain, although you can just as easily imagine the climactic scene when ""The Conjuring"" hits its shrieking crescendo (""give! to me! the! word!""). But <i>The Golem</i>'s best songs transcend the source material or draw from it themes that weren't originally there. At the album's heart is ""The Obedient Servant"", a twangy, melancholic ballad that recasts the master-and-servant relationship between the golem and his creator as that of a hopelessly devoted romantic love with Bonnie-and-Clyde overtones: ""Hurt he who hurts you/ I will be fervent/ Don't cry, it's they who die.""</p>
<p>One wonders if Francis sees something of the golem in his much revered creation, the Pixies, or at least in the legions of fans who can't help but judge his solo work against that band's godlike standard: a monster he brought to life but can't quite kill or control. (The Prague golem is said to be de-activated and stored in a synagogue there; the Pixies occasionally come back to life for a reunion tour.) Well, to add to that mindless lumbering: no, <i>The Golem</i> is not a Pixies album, but it is a Black Francis record that walks and talks surprisingly well even without the master text of its film.</p></div>"|14983.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14983-the-golem-rock-album/|6.4|Eric Grandy

Recent records from Wild Nothing, Beach Fossils, and Catwalk all have a similar penchant for long, languid melodic lines over gaps of quiet space. You can add to this list the debut LP, <i>By the Hedge</i>, from Boston indie pop outfit Minks. Their first outing has that loose, lovingly warm six-stringed feel all over it, whether it's used to take a song to its end (""Cemetery Rain"") or to fill up an entire track (the dolorous instrumental ""Indian Ocean"").</p>
<p>Minks' first single, ""Funeral Song"", was a love letter to the tinny grandiosity of pre-<i>Disintegration</i> Cure. But despite the appearance of that song and the equally gloomily titled ""Cemetery Rain"", <i>By the Hedge</i> finds the band touching on influences from the indie pop realm. Foremost among these is the Clientele, whose brand of dusty nostalgia has been seeping into new corners in the past few years. Here, Minks adapt the style that the Clientele matured into over their recent full-lengths, which adds a foreboding touch to these love-and-regret-focused songs.</p>
<p>Lead singer/songwriter Sean Kilfoyle also takes stabs at early shoegaze (think the quieter moments of <i>Isn't Anything</i>-era My Bloody Valentine), dark post-punk textures, and Slumberland-style indie pop. This mÃ©lange makes Minks somewhat of an anomaly on their label; while other Captured Tracks artists tend to have a style and stick to it-- Beach Fossils' distanced nostalgia, Wild Nothing's Smiths devotionals, the Jameses' brutal weirdness-- Minks seem more content to play the field. It works to their advantage on <i>By the Hedge</i>. The band's one constant is their lyrics, which deal with familiar pop song tropes-- ""girls with broken hearts,"" sunlight and summertime, teenage doubt. But there's always a place for a skillful young band that draws from its record collection and sings about the problems between boys and girls.</p></div>"|14977.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14977-by-the-hedge/|7.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

Steve Hauschildt, standing stock-straight behind a tidy array of electronic gear, looked like an understudy for Kraftwerk, right down to the red shirt. Guitarist Mark McGuire played an emotive rocker, his hair dangling in his face like Thurston Moore, a hint of Jimi Hendrix in his body language. John Elliott was the headbanger: With his back to the audience and his frame bent over a rack of synthesizers, he paced and flipped his mane, pumping his fist in the air to rhythms that often seemed audible only to him.</p>
<p>So it's ironic that Elliott is also responsible for one of the mellowest, gentlest offerings to come from the musicians' extended catalog. It's not hard to connect this self-titled album from his Imaginary Softwoods alias to Emeralds or any of Elliott's other projects, like Mist (with Sam Goldberg) and Outer Space. All 12 tracks are based on synthesizers, sequencers, and sound-sculpting effects, and they nod to a vast realm of ambient electronic music, from Krautrock's ""kosmische"" contingent to Kevin Drumm and Tim Hecker. But they also sound little like the frenetic burble of Elliott's other work; it's the most measured and contemplative music that I've heard from him.</p>
<p>That outlier status has helped bring the album to the fore in a catalog that's strewn with cassette and CD-R releases, enough to overwhelm all but the most obsessive fan. It was originally released as a triple cassette on Cleveland's Wagon label in 2008; in 2009, Wagon re-issued it in a CD-R edition of 100 and Digitalis snuck out 150 copies on double vinyl. Finally, late last year, Digitalis brought out a more plentiful vinyl edition, remastered by James Plotkin (who also mastered Emeralds' and Oneohtrix Point Never's recent albums for Editions Mego) and cut at Berlin's Dubplates and Mastering Studios.</p>
<p>Two ideas set out the frame of the album: long, shimmering drones that rotate like threaded icicles, and stately melodic pieces almost Baroque in their sensibility. Across 12 tracks, all of them between four-and-a-half and five minutes long, Elliott slides between those two poles almost as though he were moving the crossfader on a mixer. The record opens with a faraway drone that sounds like a wave machine in a wind tunnel; the next track is similar, with a clearer sense of tone and notes that are almost distinguishable as discrete events, but still drowning in the sound of airplanes far overhead. Then, with the third track, we're thrown to the far extreme with a slow, tentative fugue. Instead of the bubbling, chugging maximalism of Emeralds or Outer Space, it makes do with the barest clusters of notes, just one or two at a time, lingering on the woolly nub of colliding overtones.</p>
<p>It's unusually luminous music, with glowing chords and delicate harmonic movement more intuited than heard; in places, it sounds not unlike Kevin Drumm's majestic <i>Imperial Horizon</i>, but with the modulations sped up tenfold, like a filament emitting tiny, uneven pulses of light at a thousand beats per minute. Many of the tracks are versions of one another, sharing sounds and recurring motifs. Tracks five and six are slight variants on the same clusters of chords, with the first filtered to emphasize a basso grumble and the second stripped shiveringly bare; they feel like still-life paintings of a single object whose difference lies mainly in the lighting.</p>
<p>Perhaps most impressive is how subtly Elliott moves from one idea to another. Track eight, the album's center of gravity, begins with a low, hurdy-gurdy drone and blossoms into an all-encompassing shimmer before a regal synthesizer melody slowly rises and escorts us into silence. (It feels almost mythical, like some musical allegory of form assembling itself from chaos.) Drop the needle several times at random, and you might imagine you were hearing bits of three or four different tracks; let it play out from start to finish and it becomes a kind of teleportation machine, dissolving you into a steady, imperceptible ripple of atoms and planting you gently back on the ground, all in under five minutes. It's a hell of a conjuring trick, like a wormhole at the heart of a hall of mirrors.</p>
<p>Whether you listen to it actively or simply as background music, the album has a way of messing with your head, full of sounds you can't decipher and structured in a way that seems to fold back upon itself. As it proceeds, it snakes its way through a succession of spaces that become increasingly difficult to tell apart-- until a new track comes on and you're thrown into an unfamiliar room once again, with dimensions you can't quite make out, but furnished with objects familiar from previous chambers. It's a richly disorienting exercise in dÃ©jÃ  vu. It's easy to get lost in these woods-- and tempting to remain there indefinitely.</p></div>"|14991.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14991-imaginary-softwoods/|7.7|Philip Sherburne

Seemingly dissatisfied with the ""one album every 18 months"" approach of some of his peers, Presley serves asÂ frontman for neo-psych group Darker My Love, guitarist for garage-poppers the Strange Boys, andÂ still found time to release the self-titled debut of his solo project, White Fence, late last year.</p>
<p>All in all, <i>White Fence</i> played like many solo bows: It was a solid-but-sometimes-unfocused tour through the artist's mental Rolodex of influences and flights of fancy. In Presley's case that happens to be the sort of 1960s and 70s folk-rock that emits a vapor trail of psychedelia behind it. <i>Is Growing Faith</i>, the second White Fence album in under a year, finds Presley trimming the fat and applying stringent focus on improving as a songwriter without discarding his dealer's phone number.</p>
<p>While songs like lead single ""Lillian (Won't You Play Drums)"", ""Sticky Fruitman Has Faith"", and ""And By Always"" continue Presley's attachment to bright guitar lines and delightfully meandering guitar solos, <i>Is Growing Faith</i> also finds him in a more exploratory mood. ""Stranger Things Have Happened (To You)"" sneaks a little country twang into the template, while the laconic, bouncy ""Your Last Friend Alive"" leads into a jangly riff that quickly turns into the lead on cacophonous surf-rock tune ""Enthusiasm"". Tracks such as those help this record feel like a more thought-out work rather than a cobbled-together collection.</p>
<p>The most drastic left-turn is ""The Mexican Twins/Life is... Too $hort"", on which Presley trades his psych influence for hip-hop. The first half of the song is a bizarre, keyboard-driven spoken word track, complete with Presley's voice being pitch-shifted to sound eerily similar to Madlib alter-ego Quasimoto; the latter-- named for the classic Bay Area rap album-- mercifully pulls in the reins musically.Â Presley's greatest successes come from putting away the drums, sitting an acoustic guitar on his lap, and showcasing his gratifyingly woozy voice. ""Tumble, Lies &amp; Honesty"" finds him double-tracking his vocals and harmonizing with himself while a wobbly keyboard line sends the humble optimism of the song's lyrics to near-soaring heights.</p>
<p>With all the psychedelic instrumental flourishes on <i>Is Growing Faith</i>, closer ""When There is No Crowd"" follows the advice of its title and is presented completely unadorned. Featuring just Presley's voice and a guitar, the song features some of the strongest songwriting on the album, with an earworm of a melody and lyrics that combine laid-back nostalgia, uncomplicated romance, stream-of-consciousness imagery, and even a little advice: ""You might go to college, and you might go to school/ And you may find religion, but don't be nobody's fool."" Ultimately, ""When There Is No Crowd"" is the most appropriate way to end the record, with the image of Presley seated alone and hunched over a tape recorder, sounding more truly comfortable for the first time in his career. Even with all of the bands he punches the time card for, it's starting to become very clear that, withÂ <i>Is Growing Faith</i>, his solo efforts are the ones that reap the most rewards.</p></div>"|14953.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14953-is-growing-faith/|7.4|Martin Douglas

Their legendary three-album evolutionary run from 1977 to 1979 predicted punk's gradual mutation into synth-pop; their second incarnation (circa 1985-1990), as a textural electro-rock outfit, anticipated the late-80s vogue for industrialized funk and dream-pop. And even their most recent reunion in 2000 was an uncannily prophetic move-- after seeing their currency rise throughout the Britpopped 90s, Wire resurfaced just as indie rock was about to be revitalized by a post-punk craze that eventually also lured first-wave peers like Gang of Four and Public Image Ltd out of retirement.</p>
<p>But if a second Wire reunion was inevitable, its outcome has been refreshingly less predictable: Not only has the band avoided the easy nostalgia trend of playing its classic albums live in their entirety, Wire Mk III have proven to be more prolific and long-lasting than the band's two storied previous phases put together. Sure, founding guitarist Bruce Gilbert checked out of the current campaign back in 2004, but the band's momentum has continued apace. And there's no reason to suggest this won't continue: The new <i>Red Barked Tree</i> shows the band's vigor, melodic prowess, and capacity to surprise remain undiminished.</p>
<p>That album title is the first brow-raiser: Amid a discography filled with cryptic names (<i>154</i>, <i>A Bell Is a Cup... Until It Is Struck</i>, <i>Object 47</i>), <i>Red Barked Tree </i>presents a disarmingly simple image that's reflected in the album's surprisingly relaxed, pastoral turns (acoustic guitars! on three songs!) and a lyrical framework addressing the emotional and environmental costs of modernity run amok. <i>Red Barked Tree</i> is a shrewdly sequenced album, and it has to be, given that its impulsive stylistic shifts-- from mechanized thrash to psychedelic folk to nervy power-pop-- mirror the ""age of fragmentation"" that Colin Newman is railing against. But its 11 songs are more or less positioned along a logical arc, where a sense of ominous unease gives way to violent release before simmering into a peaceful comedown.</p>
<p>With their 2002 <i>Read &amp; Burn</i> EP series, Wire already proved that a band of fiftysomethings could handily out-thrash all of Williamsburg, and on <i>Red Barked Tree</i>, that hot-blooded energy is still in bountiful, if more rationed, supply. But the most remarkable thing about <i>Red Barked Tree </i>is how, 34 years into their career, Wire are still eager to redefine their essence, whether in the form of shimmering, shoegazed sea shanties (""Adapt"") or a campy suave-rocker that sounds like it sauntered in off the first Roxy Music album (Graham Lewis' ""Bad Worn Thing"").</p>
<p>Even when Wire directly invoke their past work, it's subject to savvy recontextualtion: ""Clay"" puts the bouncing synth-bass frequencies of ""I Am the Fly"" to less caustic use, while ""Two Minutes"" applies the full-torque velocity of ""Too Late"" to a disaffected spoken-word commentary about modern necessities and addictions. By the time we reach the slow-burning title-track closer-- a quiet plea for eco-sanity propelled by tense, tightly coiled acoustic strums-- Wire have successfully reinvented themselves once again, this time as wise elder statesmen cautioning against a world where over-reliance on GPS systems has replaced the basic survivalist skill of knowing your map references.</p></div>"|14950.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14950-red-barked-tree/|8.0|Stuart Berman

Their records have come stamped with a frazzled cartoon monkey logo or bearing a fugly Photoshop of the duo as Madonna and child. Videos for tracks like ""Black Block"" and ""Art &amp; Cash"" run on a kind of frantic goofiness (plus: more monkeys). They collaborate with jokey rap crews TTC and Puppetmastaz (actual rapping puppets), and they spike their DJ mixes with Busta Rhymes' ebullience and Henry Rollins' ranting (""I don't know which came first, shitty rave music or the drugs"").</p>
<p>That playfulness extends beyond the gags, into their eclectic, enthusiastic taste as selectors and producers, but it's tempered by a serious-minded approach to sound design and even the occasional moment of emotional weight. It's been an animated balancing act on their two full-length studio albums and DJ mixes, but it's one they don't quite maintain on <i>Modeselektion Vol 01</i>.</p>
<p>The compilation, curated for Modeselektor's own Monkeytown Records, is meant to be a calling card for the duo's recently expanding role as event organizers, and it comes across as coolly businesslike-- despite the rainbow monkey face. The duo told Resident Advisor that ""the main concern in all of this was the idea of defying genres and the usual beef between different camps, i.e., to create without borders and be completely freestyle."" But <i>Modeselektion</i> is probably the most narrowly focused thing they've released this side of the melancholic Apparat collaboration Moderat, sticking to the territory between German techno and UK bass with little in the way of diversion. But at 18 tracks and nearly 80 minutes, it's also a decent survey of those scenes, presenting unreleased tracks from important and rising artists, and displaying Modeselektor's consistently keen ear for quality, low-end-friendly sounds.</p>
<p>2562's ""The Wind Up"" is pleasantly off-kilter, its heavily filtered chords and echoing woodblock floating over a beat that lunges and lurches around its half-step pivot. Cosmin TRG's ""Space Station Love Affair"" is an appropriately weightless interlocking of clean, clacking beats, a slippery filter sweep, and ping-ponging sonar blips. Ikonika and Optimum's ""Hum"" hides a sneaking, hollowed-out bassline amid percussive melodies and string synths. Ramadanman's ""Pitter"" puts gently sqealing synth glissandos over stuttering hi-hats and loping hand-drums.</p>
<p>And it's not like there aren't glimmers of goofiness here in the odd wonky melody or gassy bassline. Longtime Modeselektor favorite Siriusmo starts things off with a line of tipsy synth on the grin-inducing ""Das Geheimnis"", and continues with the wobbly bass and flute-like lead of SBTRKT's ""The Unspoken"". Michigan/Berlin collaborators Tadd Mulinix and Daniel Mateo turn in ""The Good Star"", whose dubby bassline walks like a jolly, fat drunk, bobbing and swaying just slightly too slowly. Robag Wruhme's ""Der Bierholer"" has some Aphex-y fun, slicing, shushing, and slurring a vocal cut-up about the over-proliferation of microphones. Modeselektor's own ""VW Jetta"" bounces between thick kick drum and rubber-banded bass synth with a kind of madcap intensity. Rephlex Records veteran Cylob's ""Pepper Spray (Capsicum Edit)"" closes the album with a characteristic dose of gleefully weird, acid-squirted electro-pop, its vocals pitched up and down all over the place-- girlish one minute, growling the next.</p>
<p>Some of the shorter or less varied tracks here wind up feeling more like Modeselektor DJ tools than stand-alone songs, and in fact a mixed version of <i>Modeselektion</i> could've made for at least a welcome bonus disc. They could have even leavened the mood with a Tipper Gore drop or the Chris Rock bit from ""Blame Game"" or whatever.</p></div>"|14975.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14975-modeselektor-presents-modeselektion-vol-01/|6.6|Eric Grandy

It casts a bleak shadow, like a graying tower block. The record heavily recalls the industrial and goth 1980s, eras of music bathed in blackness, yet beneath the squall and the otherwise monolithic sound poke out some impressive moments of clarity.</p>
<p>The record announces itself on ""Breathe the Fire"" with a Joy Division-like beat and creeping synths, Vasquez's vocal-- as on much of the record-- never rising out of a whisper. When it finally does on the tense single ""Circles"", it's wordless and yelping, sounding more like a pagan chant. That tense song eventually builds to aÂ visceral, satisfyingÂ release of noise; it's a trick repeated a few times on the album, but Vasquez's timing and restraint make it just as gratifying each time.</p>
<p>These fleeting moments of release lend some grounding to a record that-- with its slightly phasing bass lines and watery guitar-- is often hard to pin down, a perception only enhanced by the obscured vocals.Â The icy exterior ofÂ <i>The Soft Moon</i> might make it a little inaccessible, but it's never willfully obtuse, and the sequencing neatly frames one of the albums high points, ""When It's Over""-- a moment of beauty peering through the darkness that surrounds it. It's a natural centerpiece for the record, and Vasquez here allows space to surround the drums for the first time, while a fragile guitar and bass underpin glacial shifts. There's also a rare moment of transparency for the vocals as Vasquez's post-apocalyptic narrative is articulated and given a heart.</p>
<p>That ""When It's Over"" is the sole escape from the claustrophobic drums and frosty static elsewhere makes it seem even bleaker. It's as though the only respite comes for Vasquez when the world is over. While goth was always melodramatic, something about the wordless, faceless dread invoked onÂ <i>The Soft Moon</i> seems distinctly of its time and place, a world in which we're often reminded of our doomed course via out-of-reach financial barons and rogue, nation-less aggressors. That <i>The Soft Moon</i> carries the look so well here does the same trick as many of Goth's best moments-- it makes oblivion seem like an enticing prospect.</p></div>"|14997.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14997-the-soft-moon/|8.1|Hari Ashurst

The label has been releasing these things willy-nilly since about 2006, and if you're still listening at this point, you probably work in an affiliated retail store or are related to one of the artists featured.  Instead <i>KitsunÃ© Maison 10</i> is just another KitsunÃ© Music compilation-- a long one-- that happens to sport a flossier serial number than most.</p>
<p>It's hard to forget that these KitsunÃ© comps are all but destined to fail: They are long-form encapsulations of a style (dance-pop, approximately, but electro-house/blog house if you're nasty) that's usually best heard in a singles format and whose tastemaking impulses are unhidden.  In other words, KitsunÃ© would gladly subject you to 250 Yelle tracks if it meant finding one more Crystal Castles (it's basically their business model, actually).  Recent KitsunÃ© compilations seemed to be cheating in this respect, grabbing tracks from Washed Out and the Drums well after they'd been hyped elsewhere.</p>
<p><i>KitsunÃ© Maison 10</i> does away with the obvious heatseeking and returns to a collection of relative unknowns augmented with KitsunÃ© stand-bys.  Standard fare from Yelle, Two Door Cinema Club, Digitalism, and Black Strobe ensures the KitsunÃ© DNA remains intact.  A collaboration between Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor and Kompakt mainstay Justus KÃ¶hncke provides some of the only recognizeable names to American indie rock audiences.</p>
<p>The collection boasts little in the way of proper house or disco, but mutated strains recalling former KitsunÃ© mainstays Bloc Party (Clock Opera's ""Once and For All""), Cut Copy (Strange Talk's ""Climbing Walls""), and Phoenix (Is Tropical's ""South Pacific"") are in abundance.  BeatauCue's ""Disque Oh!"" adds some bombast to Gold Panda, and the Aikiu's deliriously dramatic ""The Red Kiss"" is a tart delight.  Everything here sounds ""now"" enough to feature in an iTunes commercial or a Sofia Coppola film soundtrack; anyone with knee-jerk reactions to such simple pleasures likely knows to stay well enough away from KitsunÃ© at this point.</p>
<p>If there's anything surprising about <i>KitsunÃ© Maison 10</i>, it's how eminently even the collection is.  There's plenty of terrain between Teeth's glossy electro-hop and the Orange Juice-isms of the Heartbreaks, and KitsunÃ© deserves credit for cultivating an extra-musical aesthetic where beat-driven pop sits unperturbed next to shouty punk and goth-y melodrama, so long as it's all carried out with a certain youthful sparkle.  This aesthetic, unfortunately, doesn't add replay value to the too-long <i>KitsunÃ© Maison 10</i>, and more importantly it doesn't turn Strange Talk into Cut Copy.</p></div>"|14987.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14987-kitsune-maison-10-the-fireworks-issue/|5.5|Andrew Gaerig

That remains the eternal dilemma at the heart of the Philly mainstays' sludgy, slow-burning, obstinately retrograde stoner rock: Can you stick around to watch this thing unfurl, or do you have someplace else you've gotta be? It's the thing that keeps Bardo Pond fans split between the obsessive and the nonexistent; you can bide an awful lot of time waiting for a Bardo Pond track-- hell, sometimes a whole album-- to get to the good part, and not everybody's got that kind of time. Can you spare a minute? How's about 70?</p>
<p>Bardo's latest, their eighth LP, is a self-titled affair, and the choice to go eponymous couples well with the band's stated desire to offer up a sort of distillation of its many strengths. Naturally, this particular bunch of pharma-enthusiasts have a somewhat looser notion of concision and clarity than most, and with its extraterrestrial expanses, floaty flute-drift, gnarled molasses guitars, and average song length landing on the long side of 10 minutes, <i>Bardo Pond</i> never feels particularly reeled in. Yet, for Bardo Pond, throwing everything at the wall makes for a kind of coherence; from their small-run experimental discs to their semi-formal proper LPs, their slowpoke psychonaut scuzz has floated into all sorts of strange places, with a low to match every high. <i>Bardo Pond</i> holds a mirror up to all of that, proving just as casually transcendent-- and frustratingly sputter-prone-- as the band itself.</p>
<p>Take opener ""Just Once"", which starts with kind of a happenstance guitar strum and an equally tentative-seeming Sollenberger vocal. A few more instruments glide into the mix, and Sollenberger's singing starts clinging to a loose structure, but it's quite easy to get three minutes into it before you realize it's kinda kicking your ass. What sounded at first like a half-forgotten Lucinda Williams demo has cracked the sky open with a streak of widescreen post-rock. Gently nudging a half-assed folk song into the clouds like this would be quite a back-breaker for most young bands, but <i>Bardo Pond</i> is just warming up. Sollenberger shrugs off the second coming in the seedy, Sabbath-like ""Don't Know About You""; in just four and a half minutes, it gets in, flips the blacklight on, then bids a hasty retreat. ""The Stars Behind"" might scrape the 13-minute mark, but its dense fog of shoegaze guitars and Sollenberger's pleading, near-wordless vocal feel like they could (and maybe oughta) go on forever. And the extra-sludgy, more traditionally metal ""Cracker Wrist"" finds the  Brothers Gibbons duking it out on a couple of especially irate-sounding  guitars, then allowing the rhythm section chop through the scene with a  machete. Rickety but never rambling, constantly in motion however slow, these four far-flung tunes are the playing up of strengths promised by the LP title.</p>
<p>Then there's the other three. All 37 minutes' worth of them. One can hardly fault a song called ""Sleeping"" for drowsiness-- particularly from this lot-- but boy, is it ever driftless. The monstrous 21-minute ""Undone"" that follows at least has some heft, but it feels lost in its own labyrinth until they shove the track into wall-of-sound mode just about halfway through. It's not that the song's payoff is especially inspired, it's just so well choreographed from the song's first seconds, you wonder why they'd waste so much time dancing around the eventuality. And closer ""Waynes Tune"", an Earth-y mescalized foot-shuffler, limps along. At the end of most any other Bardo Pond LP, it'd prove the fittingly nonchalant capper; here, though, dwarfed as it is by the maelstrom of ""The Stars Behind"", that it just kind of peters out feels like more of a waste than usual. But I suppose it wouldn't be a Bardo Pond album without a few extraneous seconds-- er, minutes-- and some stuff that'd sound better if only that guy from that one party would call you back. So if the sprawling, all-bases-loaded <i>Bardo Pond</i> isn't the band's best LP, it might be their most representative: both the tiresome excess and the lung-blackening reward.</p></div>"|14993.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14993-bardo-pond/|6.5|Paul Thompson

That mostly came to an end after the <i>Microcastle</i> leak turned ugly, when the previously fun back-and-forth between Cox and fans became, for him, a burden or cause of personal anxiety. Can't blame the guy: If you've ever been caught up in Internet drama, you know how shitty it feels. But Cox is still an incredibly prolific musician, and every now and again he logs onto the old site and dumps a whole heap of unreleased tracks for fans to enjoy.</p>
<p>This is one of the great things about Internet-era listening: Instead of waiting around for months for your favorite band to drop another label album, one morning you wake up and you've got two and a half hours' worth of brand-new material to sort through. It can also be overwhelming, of course, because when the new-music faucet never shuts off, you're constantly playing catch-up. This volume of songs from Cox's Atlas Sound guise pretty much typifies that feeling of music overload-- some of it's great, some of it isn't, and you have to show a good amount of patience to sift through it all in order to find the gems.</p>
<p>Recorded over 2010 at Cox's home and in his band's Notown studio in Atlanta, <i>Bedroom Databank</i> is four albums' worth of tossed-off ditties and more fully fleshed-out demos. Sonically, the collection runs from straightforward folk-pop to electronic instrumentals and songs that fall somewhere in between. The folk element is one of the first things that stands out: Generally, we think of Cox as a boundary pusher (and he is), but the more music we hear from him, the more he also comes across like a traditional singer-songwriter who really loves Bob Dylan and Neil Young. About half of this set consists of simple, waltz-time ballads recorded with a harmonica and acoustic guitar.</p>
<p>The cool thing about these country-tinged numbers is that they put Cox's lyrical content right out in the open. He's obscured words in noise and reverb plenty in the past, but he's a better songwriter than he often gets credit for, and here we get a clearer look at that part of his work. Favoring cryptic turns of phrase over straightforward storytelling, he sings about mundane stuff like getting older and more jaded in a way that makes it feel emotionally rich and sometimes very sad. The track ""New Romantic"" is an example: ""Please don't forget your hometown/ You used to see your friends/ You used to have good friends."" Or ""How to Pass the Time"", which has a similar loss-of-innocence theme: ""Your laughter used to ring out so loud/ Why can't you remember that now?""</p>
<p>The rest of the music on <i>Bedroom Databank</i> focuses on Cox's production skill, which is as sharp as ever when he wants it to be. There are Budd/Eno ambient instrumentals and some of the glitchier haze-pop from the previous Atlas Sound LPs. I'm always impressed at how he injects emotion into these things-- a song like ""Heatwave"" is just an airy wisp at first glance, but with atonal touches and looped-over guitars he makes it feel like more, something like the last seconds of a flickering daydream. As for the mixed-genre stuff, he does it better than most any bedroom producer futzing around with post-Panda Bear textures. Something like ""Wild Love"", which was probably recorded in about 15 minutes, makes all the hypnagogic pop in the world sound pretty uninspired by comparison.</p>
<p>But I'm mostly talking highlights here, and there are plenty of songs that are less worthy of your time. It's not one disc or the other, since there's good material scattered throughout, but generally I'd say <i>Volumes</i> <i>2</i> and <i>3</i> are the least essential. This is where Cox is the least focused, laying down woozy song sketches and flimsy instrumentals that seem designed more for his pleasure than his fans'. Tracks like ""Pilot Light"" and ""Crossriver"" you can hear once and comfortably not revisit. But that's the nature of this collection: It's very much a grab bag. The reason it's ultimately worth doing the digging, though, is Cox-- one of indie's most fascinating characters and a guy that just has music pouring out of him.</p></div>"|14996.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14996-bedroom-databank-vols-1-4/|6.4|Joe Colly

<p>Now, irony and winking humor does have a place in this grandiose, heal-the-masses rock music-- just witness Zoo TV-era U2. But British Sea Power <i>are not </i>U2. They're too prickly and esoteric for that. <i>Valhalla</i>'s bristling opener, ""Who's in Control?"", instead recalls the strident politicking and acerbic lyrics of tourmates Manic Street Preachers. It kicks off a promising first third that often recalls why their most pop-friendly album was accurately called <i>Open Season</i>; here, the hooks and melodies of ""Stunde Null"" and ""We Are Sound"" accurately embody the thrill of experiencing the vast expanse of nature. In between, the simmering piano epic ""Georgie Ray"" finds British Sea Power finally figuring out how to sublimate their quirkier sensibilities into arena-level hooks.</p>
<p>But while ""stunde null"" is a German term for the zero hour before a major military operation, ironically, the moment the song of the same title finishes, the chances of making good on that promise end. I don't get the band's personal attachment to ""Mongk II"" (the first in the series appeared on <i>Zeus EP</i>), as its motorik merely drones and buzzes like a handheld power drill, while the shabby Pulp rip of ""Luna"" serves as a bridge to the vaporous hangover of ""Baby"". After that particularly dull run, first single ""Living Is Easy"" gives the record a necessary jolt toward its homestretch. But just as quickly, BSP are neck-deep in the turgid repetition of ""Cleaning Out the Rooms"" ad on the way to 11 numbing minutes of ""One More Now"".</p>
<p>As long as British Sea Power continue to exist on their singular plane, it's easy to admire and probably overrate them for their ambition, and if there were a way to figure out just how ""vintage <i>Playboy</i> magazines, population control, crazy golf, Dadaist artist Kurt Schwitters, hedonism, nature, and 'French Hitchcock' Henri-Georges Clouzot"" supposedly served as the inspirations for <i>Valhalla Dancehall</i>, perhaps it might honor the investment it desperately strives for instead of painting British Sea Power as a band with interesting thoughts that don't make it to the actual music. But I worry that their wit was obvious from the start when they named their debut <i>The Decline of British Sea Power</i>, which is proving its clairvoyant gallows humor with every album.</p></div>"|14981.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14981-valhalla-dancehall/|5.5|Ian Cohen

But in a lot of ways, the two are kindred spirits. As two big dudes with booming voices and theatrical appetites, Ross and White have both taken what should've been limited styles and managed to transcend anyway, just by pushing those styles way beyond excess. White could make arenas ooze just by bellowing the word ""love"" over and over; Ross can emulsify car speakers just by roaring about all the drugs he's almost certainly never sold. And on ""Even Deeper"", a track from his new <i>Ashes to Ashes</i> mixtape, Ross sounds almost as comfortable on the smooth orchestral funk ripples of ""I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More Baby"" as White once did, with White's disembodied voice showing up to egg him on.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Ashes to Ashes</i> comes on the heels of last year's <i>Teflon Don</i> album, the moment when Ross pushed his own zero-subtlety bark to insane levels of charismatic absurdity. Beyond the singles, Ross albums used to be grim trudges, but <i>Teflon Don</i> just about burst with indulgent decadence, Ross sharing million-dollar tracks with A-list guests and slurping up every minute of it. And it also had the identity-bending anthem ""B.M.F. (Blowin' Money Fast)"", rap's song of the summer. <i>Ashes to Ashes</i> is a free mixtape dashed off on Christmas Eve, in anticipation of yet another new album that's supposedly lurking just around the corner, and it's no surprise that nothing on it reaches the facepunch immediacy of ""B.M.F."" or the chiffon luxury of ""Maybach Music III"". But for a dashed-off mixtape, the scope remains pretty epic.</p>
<p><i>Ashes to Ashes </i>has famous guests (T.I., Ludacris) and big producers (Boi-1da, Lex Luger), and its sonic depth and serious mastering job are enough to push it way beyond most mixtapes. But the mixtape's best moments come directly from Ross himself. Here, he continues to conjure hilariously larger-than-life ways to let you know he's spending more money than you are: ""I'm still ballin' like I'm Bo Diddley! I park the Caddy in the living room!"" On ""Retrosuperfuture"", he claims to be ""skateboarding aboard the Pan American,"" and the image of Ross skateboarding anywhere, for any reason, is pretty amazing. Even Ross' dumbest moments are fun. On ""John Doe"", he says he's ""jumping niggas like a chess piece,"" and unless he's talking about the knight, I'm pretty sure he's thinking of checkers. And on the chorus of the very first song, he rhymes ""cell phone"" with ""iPhone""; he's almost certainly the only big rapper currently working who could get away with that.</p>
<p>The tape moves from bangers to slick, more meditative tracks before returning to bangers, and it might work better if it were all bangers, all the time. Ross knows he's onto something with ""B.M.F."", and he sounds more urgent and alive over churning minor-key trunk-slams than over just about everything else. But other than one godawful chorus from the Chester French chump, the whole thing comes off slick and professional-- more than enough to tide the world over in the brief period between Ross albums. And it ends on a deliriously high note: ""Another One"", an early glimpse of Ross' new Bugatti Boyz duo with Diddy, one of the only guys alive who can match Ross in sheer, infectious money-zest. These two sound just awesome together, Diddy inhabiting Ross' flow and Ross relishing his violent punchlines just a little bit more. This guy is just having fun with us now.</p></div>"|14973.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14973-ashes-to-ashes/|7.1|Tom Breihan

Not like dubstep or electroclash or hyphy blew up. Footwork is really more of a lit fuse at this point, and one of those painfully slow, Wile E. Coyote-style fuses at that. Roughly, footwork pits sharp, repetitive samples of soul, hip-hop, and reggae against limping, junkyard-dog 808s. It is music composed, at least theoretically, to encourage a specific kind of dancing, but the strangeness of the tracks suggests the producers have ulterior motives. (The dancing looks a bit like breakdancing, but using your arms is discouraged.) <i>Bangs &amp; Works, Vol. 1</i> is the first widely available compilation of footwork music, released by London-based Planet Mu, whose founder, Mike Paradinas, is relentless in his quest for new sounds.</p>
<p>There is little question why footwork evolved in Chicago: House music birthed the raunchier, uptempo ghetto house (or ""juke""), which in turn led to the stripped-for-parts footwork sound. Like ghetto house, tracks usually settle in around 160 bpm; at 140 you've found yourself a ballad. There are hip-hop roots too: the sound's genesis is rooted in RP Boo's ""Baby Come On"", a track that prominently features an Ol' Dirty Bastard sample (sadly not included here). Other tracks owe a debt to hip-hop's vulgar confidence. Kanye West is said to have been influenced by the scene's early progenitors.</p>
<p>Chicago-based journalist and DJ Dave Quam called footwork ""more or less the gum under the shoe of mainstream electronic music,"" which is a fantastic visual that also speaks to the tuff pliability of the sound. Footwork is not expansive. Unlike, say, house music, which has been refracted into a million directions, <i>Bangs &amp; Works</i> will sound homogenous and alien on first listen (remember back to your first listen to <i>Run the Road</i> or <i>Favela Booty Beats</i>; shit's going to start off a little annoying). Repeated listens will parcel the tracks into three or so basic categories: short, styled dance numbers; novelty tracks; and slyly artful tracks.</p>
<p>Regarding that third category: it's probably fair to say that ghetto house never spawned tracks that sought as obviously to transcend their club context as DJ Elmoe's ""Whea Yo Ghost At, Whea Yo Dead Man"" or DJ Trouble's ""Bangs &amp; Works"". Tracks like DJ Roc's ""One Blood"" and DJ Nate's ""Ima Dog"" remind me of anyone's first experience with a sampler: They invariably mash a single pad, rhythmically restarting the sample again and again.</p>
<p>The core element of footwork appears to be contrast: between the sharp drums and the melodic samples, between art and novelty. ""Ima Dog"" pits its ripping, staccato title sample against what sounds like a new age elegy. RP Boo's ""Eraser"" feigns Armageddon, but its ascendant soul diva exposes it as something more optimistic. DJ Nate's ""He Ain't Bout It"" mixes banal trash talk with soothing chants. ""Jungle Juke"" goofily steals from ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"", and ""Freddy vs. Jason"" is a horror-movie mashup.</p>
<p>Footwork seems like it should be a young man's game, but it's not, really. It's been fermenting in Chicago for at least a decade, if not longer, and many of its principals-- RP Boo, DJ Rashad, DJ Roc, DJ Spinn-- are hardly fresh faces. Footwork reminds me spiritually of the blues that artists like Junior Kimbrough used to play: raunchy, fun music that knowingly sacrificed complexity for rhythm (the ramshackle clubs this music was played in: juke joints). And like some strains of blues, footwork appears to be catching on overseas before it finds larger audiences stateside. Bristol-based dubstep producer Addison Groove's ""Footcrab"", one of the year's dance music smashes, is an obvious homage and would be even if its mantra-like, goofball refrain didn't sound like a G-rated version of DJ Roc's ""Fuck Dat"".</p>
<p>At this point, it's not worth speculating about the future prospects of the footwork scene. If dubstep and house long ago left the club in search of other musical terrains, footwork is only just peeking out the door. The real promise of <i>Bangs &amp; Works</i> isn't an international footwork movement per se, but a generation of resourceful and creative producers-- heretofore ignored-- redefining dance music for themselves. Here's hoping the size of their audience matches their appetites for the goofy, the melancholy, and the left-field.</p></div>"|14985.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14985-bangs-works-vol-1-a-chicago-footwork-compilation/|8.3|Andrew Gaerig

You begin on a flat, white plain, and you watch the landscape go by. It's so unchanging, it's hypnotizing, and you notice changes only when you look away for a second and then refocus. The ground gets rougher, maybe slopes. Something appears on the horizon, mountains in the distance. The angle of the sun changes, and with it the quality of the light. It's actually that last bit that is closest to the experience Dunn provides on his best extended works. If you were to watch the same spot on the ground all day, its appearance would vary greatly over time, but not in such a way that you'd register the changes as distinct moments when something was suddenly different.</p>
<p>It may seem as though I'm comparing listening to his music to watching paint dry (and to some people, that's probably what the glacially shifting 17-minute drone ""Butel"" will seem like), but it really is interesting, involving music for fans of ambient drone. The sound sources for this music are brass, strings, and guitar, plus piano on a couple of short tracks, but it's hard to distinguish which source you're hearing at any given time because Dunn uses a computer to thoroughly distend, reshape, and smear these sounds until they result in new timbres of his own creation.</p>
<p>Four of the 12 pieces on <i>Young Person's Guide</i> originally appeared on the download-only album <i>Fervency</i> (the ""young person's guide"" title of this release seems like a self-conscious joke about our instant-archive culture, and may also be a King Crimson reference), and they're here inserted into a massive, two-hour, 12-song cycle of drones and textures. The eight extra tracks are from the same sessions that produced <i>Fervency</i>, and they are far from padding. I think this actually works better than that album precisely because of its much longer running time, and the shorter, more active pieces on the entirely new second disc help balance the longest, stillest tracks. There is a certain element to this supremely patient music that requires immersion for the listener to really draw maximum satisfaction from it, and positioning these four familiar tracks as a much more expansive work accomplishes that. Think Stars of the Lid's sprawling double-disc albums for a point of comparison.</p>
<p>I don't think Dunn's work here will do much to pull in listeners who haven't enjoyed drone music in the past-- it's too committed to the form and takes stasis too seriously for that-- but for drone fans this stuff is catnip. On the second disc especially, the injection of muted broadcast samples and rougher textures offers a welcome evolution of Dunn's style, one that he's also tentatively explored on the <i>Rural Route No. 2 </i>EP. As an expansion of <i>Fervency</i>, <i>Young Person's Guide </i>fills in what in hindsight was a very incomplete picture of where Dunn was as an artist during the recording, and in the process becomes his definitive statement so far.</p></div>"|14946.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14946-a-young-persons-guide-to-kyle-bobby-dunn/|7.5|Joe Tangari

Among the best bits is Morrison's story of sketching the album's now-famous cover on his computer, then showing it off to skeptical friends. ""People would just stare at me,"" he remembers. ""It's a weird image. I've seen people with tattoos of it in the last few years.""</p>
<p>To a certain segment of indie kids, many now indie adults,Â branding ourselves permanently with that weird sunset scene seems no stranger than an older dude's Black Flag bars or a youngster's <i>Funeral</i> laptop wallpaper. To many, <i>Emergency &amp; I</i>, first released in 1999,Â isÂ <i>that</i> record; breakup balm, to be sure, but also the voice in your head, the thing that seems to say as much about us as we know about ourselves. Though its influence on music at large has been difficult to chart, if we're to gauge a work's import by what it's meant to the people that come across it,Â <i>Emergency &amp; I</i> is one of indie's key LPs. Its songs-- nervy, cacophonous, uncomfortably real-- actually mean something to people, whether they came to the record recently or have been letting it run through their lives for the last decade and change.</p>
<p>The history of <i>Emergency &amp; I</i> isn't contained in the particulars of Eric Axelson's bass tone, or the band's brush-up with Interscope, or how much they liked Brainiac, or what was or wasn't going on in D.C. in the late 1990s. That stuff is just the prelude. Fact is, the history of <i>Emergency &amp; I</i> lies with the people; people who hear too much of themselves in ""The Jitters"", who've vented spleen to the tune of ""What Do You Want Me to Say?"", who've cast off all shackles to the strains of ""Back and Forth"". Morrison claims not to grasp the significance of the album's title, but it's always seemed fairly obvious to me: There's the encroaching chaos of modern life-- the emergency-- and then there's you, standing outside it, yet inextricably linked. <i>Emergency &amp; I</i> is a record about learning how to live with both.</p>
<p>Better than anyone, Morrison captures that awful, driftless, locked-up feeling you back yourself into sometimes; bored at work, unlucky in love, low on friends, lower on prospects. You're unsure where to move, be it another city or into another room, or whether either is worth the effort; that feeling, so perfectly articulated in ""The City"", that ""something seems to happen somewhere else,"" yet for reasons financial and social and geographical alike, you're powerless to do anything about it. Call it self-insult to existential injury: You're so down, you start counting yourself out. That's ""Spider in the Snow"", in which a change of scenery still means the ""same VCR, the same cats""; the same rut. That's ""Memory Machine"", in which eternal life seems little more than an excuse to chain-smoke. That, especially, is ""The Jitters"", in which our sick and sad protagonist can't bring himself to do much more than 10,000 push-ups a day.</p>
<p>ButÂ allowing himself to wallowÂ or pointing fingers at everyone but himself, Morrison assesses the situation, turns over the problems in his head, sorts out what's in his control and what's out of it, and moves along. He sometimes invents elaborate metaphysical devices-- the all-access pass of ""You Are Invited"", the memory machine of ""Memory Machine""-- to explain away what a more rational observation couldn't, but he's a strikingly realistic, austere lyricist, detailing just how dull feeling like crap can be, encouraging action even when he's not so certain he can manage it himself. He's not striving for perfection, just normalcy. That's struggle enough.</p>
<p>All this, Morrison delivers deftly, elastically, switching up cadence to match the mood. In 2011, an indie rock frontman copping to liking rap doesn't merit mention, but Morrison's MC-inspired delivery was and is rather novel; his voice alone is just a few notches above merely okay, yet he's never less than a commanding presence on the mic, able to pull off sharp tone-switches and jutting asides with the unusual clarity of a guy who's picked up just as much from Rakim as Ian MacKaye. Drummer Joe Easley's gifts are immediately apparent, his beefy, hyperkinetic style owing as much to dusty rock royalty as the then-contemporary drum'n'bass the band were clearly keen on. Axelson's basswork is unparalleled in both speed and tone. Jason Caddell's guitar weaves in and out of the tunes; they're a rock band, but not a guitar band per se, and Caddell's reserve is a big reason why they rarely get lumped in with the glut of D.C.'s spazzy post-hardcore contemporaries. And that woozy synth, a frequent presence throughout <i>Emergency</i>, beautifully echoes the weary resolve of Morrison's lyrics. Nearly as much as his voice and their explosive rhythm section, that keyboard smear is the sound of <i>Emergency &amp; I</i>.</p>
<p>The Plan's melodic sense was unusual, borderline dissonant, and their arrangements curiously spare and well-considered. It's a busy record but never cluttered; weird but not altogether alien; lush and constantly transmogrifying. It is a perfectly realized sound-- difficult if not impossible to imitate. Not even the band itself ever quite sounded like this anywhere else.Â As the liners explain, at some point during the sessions, all assembled parties came to the realization that what they were working on was really something special.Â The reissue comes with a smattering of enjoyable singles, but even the best of those-- the barnstorming ""B.O.B."" rewrite ""The Dismemberment Plan Gets Rich""-- feels thin and frenzied next to the vibrant, remarkably self-assured <i>Emergency &amp; I</i> material.</p>
<p>That tension between musical perfection and lyrical uncertainty is the heart of <i>Emergency &amp; I</i>; here you have these incredibly exacting musicians playing this gorgeous, frantic, hyperstylized pop who then let some neurotic chart his insecurities over top. And yet the two disparate sides form an electrifying symbiosis. The music seems to alchemize around Morrison's lyrics, throbbing and melting to match the mood: ""The Jitters"" is the most downtrodden in tone and tempo alike, steady closer ""Back and Forth"" echoes a kind of acceptance with the state of things, frantic Brainiac hat-tip ""Girl O'Clock"" feels like the murderous sexual frustration it depicts. ""8 1/2 Minutes"" is positively apocalyptic, its whirring keyboards and Axelson's humongous bass runs akin to sonic blitzkrieg, and while the world ends around him, all Morrison can talk about is how beautiful it is. It's a survival strategy, the self-obsessive's way of navigating the world, a way to keep the emergency at bay. That's what Morrison seems to be positing throughout <i>Emergency &amp; I</i>, urged along by its crazy rhythms: Retreat is as good as defeat. Bad as it gets, you've gotta keep moving.</p>
<p>I was a teenager when I first heard <i>Emergency &amp; I</i>, still months from college, in a relationship I sensed then was shaky and know now was doomed. Back then, it was a constant. It deepened further for a couple years afterward, after I'd discovered all sorts of instincts I couldn't trust, after I'd found that I too can put myself on pause the way Morrison does in ""The Jitters"". I set it aside for a while in my mid-twenties, convinced I'd juiced the thing of all its meaning; then I lost a job and a best friend in quick succession, and I buried myself in it again, uncovering untold solace in the same old lines. Talking about these songs with others over the past few weeks, arguing over their slippery meanings, there's precious little in the way of consensus; we've all used it for breakups, for family emergencies, for nights when we're feeling low and can't quite settle on the source. But there's so much in these songs, so many situations to which they seem to hold up a mirror, what we take from them seems forever in flux. Their history, like ours, is constantly changing. One thing keeps coming up, though: Everyone I've talked to mentions that they can't imagine getting through their twenties without it. I certainly couldn't have. Bet those guys who made it feel the same way.</p></div>"|14979.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14979-emergency-i-vinyl-reissue/|10.0|Paul Thompson

N.E.R.D. have released only four albums, and after their second one, they switched labels from Virgin to Interscope. So maybe that's why all of this so-called best-of album only includes stuff from those first two albums and completely ignores their post-2004 existence. So that's pretty weird. But even weirder is the very idea of a N.E.R.D. best-of in the first place. As the Neptunes, Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo have had one of the all-time great runs of any pop production team, cranking out dozens of hits for tons of artists across the stylistic spectrum-- usually finding room for their own austere future-funk sensibility in the process. But N.E.R.D. is their vanity project, the one that allows them to push that sensibility toward riskier, proggier areas and removes them, at least in theory, from the pressures of the marketplace. Theoretically then, this is a group that should not have a greatest hits album.</p>
<p>Of course, N.E.R.D. is a way messier project than that suggests, and if these guys didn't care about making hits on their own, they wouldn't have made an awkward car commercial during last year's VMAs. The tracks on <i>Best Of</i> are pop songs that failed in interesting ways, by pushing the Neptunes' Triton click-thuds into punk-rock clatter and spotlighting Pharrell Williams' truly goofy sloganeering. As N.E.R.D., the Neptunes couldn't just make a great strip-club song; they had to force in all these fake-profound lines about how the real strippers are <i>politicians</i> and <i>society</i>. But at its best, this stuff worked anyway because they knew they were being absurd and because they couldn't help but make great pop songs. That strip-club song, ""Lapdance"", is their first single, Pharrell flexing a slithery Curtis Mayfield falsetto over cowbell-heavy strut-funk while never-seen-again white rapper Lee Harvey drops an endearingly ridiculous guest verse that I still quote when I get drunk enough: ""Burnin' a flag, all in the name of white trash!""</p>
<p>When N.E.R.D. worked, that sort of messy collision between good and bad ideas was what made them work. They recorded their debut album, 2002's <i>In Search Of...</i>, twice: once on their own, once with funk-metal crew Spymob backing them up. Alas the Spymob version was the one that eventually saw American release. The Neptunes, totally on fire at the time, seemed smart enough to know that they didn't need a rock band cluttering up their arrangements; they should've been above that sort of Warped Tour pandering. But listening back to those tracks now, it's pretty remarkable how they made their spare sci-fi pop work even though all that fuzz-pedal abuse.</p>
<p>All the best moments on <i>Best Of</i> come from <i>In Search Of...</i> ""Provider"" is the rare drug-trade chronicle that admits to uncertainty and desperation, and its slick, bluesy swagger only adds to its depth. ""Rock Star"" gives us the irresistible spectacle of Pharrell pretending to be a Hot Topic cashier and railing against ""posers"", and its classic Neptunes slink makes even the overcompressed Static-X fuzz assault sound cool enough for Jay-Z to freestyle over it on the great <i>S. Carter Collection</i> mixtape. ""Truth or Dare"" is oozing, sinister dance-funk with just a hint of My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult decadence working for it. <i>In Search Of...</i> is a sloppy and uneven piece of work, but it's a lot of fun hearing these highlights again.</p>
<p>In all, <i>Best Of</i> includes eight of <i>In Search Of...</i>'s 12 tracks, jumbled up and sprinkled with songs from the way-less-inspired follow-up <i>Fly or Die</i>. If you already have <i>In Search Of...</i> in your iTunes, there's no reason to seek out <i>Best Of</i>. If you don't, there's no reason to start with this one instead. The rare tracks here, like the Justice remix of the <i>Fly or Die</i> single ""She Wants to Move"", don't warrant more than a listen or two, and the compilers missed a golden opportunity when they opted not to include the slept-on Native Tongues remix of ""She Wants to Move"", which recruited rap's late-80s art-kid geniuses to rap about butts over Adam Ant-esque burundi drums and somehow made the whole thing work. And on top of that, there's just no way to compile an hour-plus N.E.R.D. comp without tossing in a few clangers, whether or not you include anything from the last two albums. So what we have hear is a fun and sometimes frustrating listen, and one that has absolutely no reason to exist.</p></div>"|14984.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14984-the-best-of-nerd/|4.0|Tom Breihan

Asthmatic Kitty's campaign last year to re-release producer Roberto Carlos Lange's work as Epstein appeared less like a revelation than a gentle reminder of something unintentionally misplaced in the decade's deluge of music. The Brooklyn-by-way-of-Florida beatmaker and sound artist isn't exactly an unknown. He's released albums as Helado Negro, participated in Guillermo Scott Herren's Savath y Savalas project, produced Bear in Heaven's latest album, and collaborated with Juliana Barwick, among other projects. But the spliced-together sections of Epstein compositions on this remix disc make a case for revisiting that particular part of his back catalog, an eclectic one filled with dusty, laid-back beats and the occasional lyricism of jazz, like the trumpet on ""Y Entonces"".</p>
<p>Herren teamed up with Jason ""Jaytram"" Trammell, Yeasayer's drummer as well as a past collaborator on Epstein records, to re-appropriate and reshape Epstein's sound collages. While his band is known for kinetic and multilayered production, Jaytram's contributions often feel suspended, viscous melodies with samples stretched like taffy. ""You Know They Out"" gingerly steps forward, woozy and lightheaded, while ""Haunted Hotel Beat"" starts with a bulbous sample from ""Needed"" before lurching forward with half-speed swagger. The slightly tense ""Joy Me""-- propelled in part by the chopped-up bassline from ""Sin Pueblo"", off 2005's <i>Gente Sin Pueblo--</i> is topped off with the gorgeous vocals of ""A Lost Animal"" provided by Alejandra and Claudia Deheza from the School of Seven Bells.</p>
<p>Herren and Lange's shared history in Savath y Savalas isn't as evident on the Prefuse 73 remixes. Herren leans toward his short-attention-span style rather than his more Iberian, folktronica work, and tracks like the brief ""Mar del Enfermo Abrazos"" seem to corkscrew in on themselves. Granted, Herren could graft together any number of shape-shifting compositions from a handful of random albums, but it's a credit to Lange's range that Herren doesn't seem bored or limited by the source material.</p>
<p>None of the remixes on <i>Prefuse 73/Jaytram/Epstein</i> come off as revelatory, and actually they may make a better case overall for the originals than themselves, especially Jaytram's, which breathe enough to provide clearer glimpses of Epstein's work. It's always telling to see yourself through your friend's eyes, and while the raw material isn't immediately recognizable, it will definitely make some curious.</p></div>"|14982.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14982-prefuse-73jaytramepstein/|6.5|Patrick Sisson

It's difficult to sift through any music content online without stumbling across reams of opaque artists blurring out the world, many of whom were tied together under the ""hypnagogic pop"" banner. Real Estate guitarist Matthew Mondanile is one such musician, principally for his work as Ducktails. Fortunately, and perhaps wisely, considering the glut of soupy material out there, <i>Arcade Dynamics</i> is a step away from the nebulous constructs of Ducktails' last full-length record <i>Landscapes</i>. Instead, it edges closer to the conventional song structures of Mondanile's work in his other band.</p>
<p>Unlike <i>Landscapes</i>, there's a great shaft of light cleaved through this album, a loosening up of the murk that beautifully corroded Mondanile's prior work. Similarly, the harkening back to 1980s video game soundtracks and half-remembered VHS ephemera has been condensed down to a few songs (""The Razor's Edge"", ""Arcade Shift""). Perhaps Mondanile was wary of the current genre clog, or maybe the chance to stretch into bigger venues via the upwardly curved Real Estate touring schedule inspired him to saturate his music with more space. Either way, this is a subtle refraction of the Ducktails aesthetic, where the brittle abstraction and detours down lo-fi cul-de-sacs are siphoned into songs that are breezier, less inward looking, more in thrall to the possibilities of pop.</p>
<p>Album opener ""In the Swing"" signifies the general thrust, with a TropicÃ¡lia-inflected guitar thrum shoved to the fore, and the filmy tape damage less obtrusive than before. Not that this is a vast leap in production values; the drums on ""Hamilton Road"" sound like someone thwacking away on a cardboard box, and ""Sprinter"" is set to a thin slurry of drum machine noise. But the difference in vocal delivery is pronounced, with Mondanile widening his scope, from the deep Elvis Costello drawl of ""Hamilton Road"" to the wistful hankering of ""Sunset Liner"". Similarly, the guitar tones offer a broader range, including country-fied plucking, squelched-out wah-wah dynamics, and the crystal clean jazz-pop inclinations the Sea and Cake veer toward.</p>
<p><i>Arcade Dynamics</i> peaks over two tracks. ""Killin the Vibe"" is driven by Mondanile's milky Hawaiian guitar lilt and a pensive summertime-at-dusk chorus flooded with stacked-up vocal harmonies. Panda Bear appears on an alternate take of this track, further elevating it with bursts of peppy vocalizing, although his contribution simply serves as a saccharine bolster to its perfectly understated pop goodness. The sweetly melancholy ""Art Vandelay"" is the twin highlight here, where the sound is scooped into an irresistibly catchy verse/chorus/verse structure that further blurs the lines between Ducktails and Real Estate, especially as the latter has performed this song. If further proof were needed of Ducktails' malleability, <i>Arcade Dynamics</i> ends with another bend in the road, the 10-minute improv amble through ""Porch Projector"", which severs open another possible world in which Mondanile could reconfigure this ever-evolving project.</p></div>"|14960.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14960-ducktails-iii-arcade-dynamics/|7.4|Nick Neyland

It seems to be about Gelb's romantic life, a woman he loves who loves him back, but the second half of the couplet also works as a model for Giant Sand fandom. Finding the diamond in the band's music is sometimes difficult-- for more than 25 years, Gelb has led various versions of the band on a winding path that began with ragged desert rock and has since mellowed to something that sounds like confessional singer/songwriter music.</p>
<p>Gelb's followers largely know what to expect by this point, but if you're new to Giant Sand and wondering where you might first try to go in their imposing catalog, there are a few things to know. First is that, more than a lot of other music that could reasonably be called rootsy, this stuff requires something of the listener. Gelb's singing voice is not tuneful and never really has been. On <i>Blurry Blue Mountain</i>, you can hear his command of songwriting and melodic vocabulary in the writing, but in the delivery, there's a gap. The voice never quite rises to outline that melody fully, and to some degree you have to bring your own knowledge of what he's implying to complete the picture. It's music that grows on you as you give more of yourself to it, but whereas close reference points like Calexico and American Music Club have a certain immediacy, Gelb's work doesn't.</p>
<p>I think it's worth working with Gelb. The music may not feel accessible right away, but what it reveals with time is rewarding. The backing on <i>Blurry Blue Mountain</i>, provided by a five-piece band of mostly Danish musicians assembled for the project (he's worked with each of them before), is professional and tight, with lots of muted guitar, brushed drums, and steel guitar coloring the edges. For a record recorded mostly in Denmark, it's amazing how strongly it evokes Gelb's Arizona home, specifically the Sonoran Desert. They get it at both times of day, too: ""Monk's Mountain"" captures the chill of the night in seven and a half minutes of ink-black, tense rock, and it's immediately followed by ""Spell Bound"", which is as sunny as anything Gelb's ever done. The band breaks out a little to rock harder on ""Brand New Swamp Thing"" and ""Thin Line Man"", and the twangy guitar and group vocals of ""Ride the Rail"" call to mind a subdued version of Johnny Cash's take on ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"". Just imagine that Cash sang in a raspy whisper.</p>
<p>That raspy whisper provides an odd counterpoint to Gelb's jazz-inflected parlor piano style on ""Time Flies"" and the lovely closer, ""Love a Loser"". The last song is perhaps the starkest demonstration of the incongruous way Gelb's writing fits his voice. The piano carries nearly all the melodic weight, but it's easy to hear the notes he's not getting to and, after a while, fill them in. It's something his fans are used to. It's an adjustment (and for some, too much of an adjustment) for everyone else. If you're willing to make the time, though, <i>Blurry Blue Mountain</i> will repay your attention.</p></div>"|14986.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14986-blurry-blue-mountain/|6.9|Joe Tangari

Determining whether the former justifies or excuses the latter isn't always clear. What I <i>am</i> sure of is that their live show aims for uplift and often gets there. Their singles have been fantastic across the board, and as such, if <i>Live at Ancienne Belgique </i>plays its cards right, it would be the best Yeasayer record to date.</p>
<p>Though <i>Live </i>was released during the holidays for free on Yeasayer's website, they didn't exactly have <i>carte blanche</i>: this is a document of them touring <i>Odd Blood </i>after all, not a real chance to create a Greatest Hits. Still, the first two inclusions from their latest record here feel pretty comprehensive in summing up all angles of Yeasayer. Besides already being a choice cut from <i>Odd Blood</i>, ""Madder Red"" is performed beautifully as the opener, the confident work of a band that's toured themselves into something more purposeful and virtuosic, nailing every contour on the swooping falsetto hook while the vocals ache tenderly. But with ""Rome"", one the few indie rock songs of recent vintage that instantly remind me of Phish, the band barely keeps the arrangement together over its bouncing-ball beat.</p>
<p>Yeah, there's plenty hackysack about Yeasayer, but if <i>Live </i>helps us remember anything, it's that this is a pop band, not a jam band (and besides, there's an aside about their snazzy gray suits to update you on their fashion sense). These songs often pop with big hooks, the drones are more about blissing out than tuning out, and they definitely don't ramble-- while the elastic highlight ""O.N.E"" could conceivably go on as long as they want, they let it stretch out a deserved amount, recognizing it's the point where <i>Odd Blood </i>hit its stride. Otherwise, not much stage banter, no rarities, no soloing.</p>
<p>As a progress report of Yeasayer, the most valuable aspect of <i>Live </i>is the exposure of the connective tissue between two records of highly varying sonic character. <i>All Hour Cymbals </i>felt at home when African influences and Animal Collective were truly starting to lord over Brooklyn in 2007, but it was hindered by sounding like it was produced by Kirby, everything puffy, drifting, and expansive like a floating marshmallow. In its original incarnation, ""Red Cave"" was a bowl-passing hoedown, but here, it's rendered with spacious expanse and clarity. And while <i>Odd Blood </i>took a hard left by embracing a modernized take on 1985's State of the Art pop production, previously wigged out and bogged down numbers like ""Grizelda"" and ""Strange Reunions"" scale back the overzealous Pro Tooling to reveal handcrafted and ultimately penetrable sonic environments.</p>
<p>With these things, armchair quarterbacking is inevitable, but that's part of the point-- ""I Remember"" feels like a pretty egregious exclusion, and a personal choice would've been the doomy dirge of ""Wait for the Wintertime"", just to show they could go out of character.  Then again, some of these songs beg to be replaced-- ""Mondegreen"" is no longer saddled with its soul-clapping gospel aspirations, instead rolling out over clattering mixed percussion; but it's still a moment when their lyrical gregariousness got the best of them. The chopped and screwed vocals on ""The Children"" are amongst the most unpleasant I've heard in some time, and its placement toward the end of <i>Live </i>is further proof that its only proper context as a song, rather than a three-minute sound effect, is as the gauntlet-throwing opener of <i>Odd Blood</i>.</p>
<p>Or, it's at the very least a nod toward the kiddie choir during the coda of closer ""2080"", still a signature song. Like ""Ambling Alp"", it's a most effective group hug because the acknowledgement of dark struggles makes overcoming them with their rousing chants feel earned instead of prefab. Yeasayer undoubtedly shoot for populism, which you don't need cohesive albums for, just great songs that aim directly for a communal effect. <i>Odd Blood </i>was by no means a cohesive album, but for the most part, <i>Live </i>is, and its best tracks should make any fan eager for more.</p></div>"|14974.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14974-live-at-ancienne-belgique/|7.4|Ian Cohen

In 2005, the unknown Minnesota quartet self-released its self-produced, 41-minute indie rock romp, <i>The Loon</i>. A little Pavement, a little Pixes, and a lot of hooks, <i>The Loon</i> was bright-eyed and charming enough to overcome its retread tendencies. Critical buzz built for the band like a brushfire; by the time the record industry convened in Texas for South by Southwest in March 2006, one assumed Tapes 'n Tapes were the next Great American Rock Band.</p>
<p>They did their part in Austin, playing nine shows in four days and earning a record contract. XL Recordings re-released <i>The Loon</i> a few months later and sent the band into the studio with Dave Fridmann, the producer behind successes from Mogwai, Mercury Rev, and the Flaming Lips and, more relevantly, failures by more than a dozen young indie rock bands. The result, <i>Walk It Off</i>, is another Fridmann folly. Hookless, clumsy, and needlessly aggressive, the band's second album met a deluge of critical derision and sold far fewer copies than its predecessor. Tapes 'n Tapes are no longer on XL Recordings.</p>
<p><i>Outside</i>, the band's third album, again finds Tapes 'n Tapes not only self-releasing and self-producing but redoubling their efforts at indie rock homage. The melodies and the influences are more defined, as are the poses; <i>Outside</i> is a fine but ultimately feckless return to form, an attempt to rebuild <i>The Loon</i>'s simple charms. Tapes 'n Tapes have always been a serviceable and studied indie rock band. Technically, they've never been as crisp or as confident as they are on <i>Outside</i>. Frontman Josh Grier is a fine guitarist, as comfortable with blitzing through distorted hazes as he is swiveling through an upbeat swing. He's even broadened his palette as a singer, a chameleon with a big record collection. Drummer Jeremy Hanson is similarly elastic, as capable of the rock wallop of ""Nightfall"" as he is the graceful sway of ""People You Know"". Horns, keys, and bass offer ballast and texture, rounding the band's basic sound
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
with unexpected flourishes.</p>
<p>The trouble with Tapes 'n Tapes is that they sound a little like a lot of bands but never very much like any one band-- namely, themselves. On ""SWM"", for instance, Grier flexes his scruff, intimating Eric Bachmann transitioning from Archers of Loaf to Crooked Fingers with a lighter heart. The elastic rhythm, worldly wanderlust, and expanded vocabulary of ""One in the World"" suggest the spry pop of both Vampire Weekend and Bishop Allen. Above howling organ peals and tormented drum runs on ""The Saddest of All Keys"", Grier does his best Nick Cave sneer, while the measured ""Hidee Ho"" presents him as a sort of sashaying version of the Walkmen's Hamilton Leithauser. Tapes 'n Tapes have floundered for distinction and identity from the start. <i>The Loon</i> got a free pass, and <i>Walk It Off</i> was too unfortunate for any band to claim too long. <i>Outside</i> still feels like the work of a veteran band searching for its sound.</p>
<p>What's worst about <i>Outside</i> is that it leaves Tapes 'n Tapes-- just four years ago, a bunch of snappy, sloppy indie rock bros from the Midwest-- exactly there, on the outside. After an intense sophomore slump for a large label, they retreated to their own imprint and to their own production instincts and, really, to the same indie hero rock that first made them a big deal. This time, though, it sounds stiff and sapped of fun. In 2005, it was surprising-- occasionally, even thrilling-- to hear such indie rock Ã©lan from a new band. The music was youthful and fresh, the sound of a band who seemingly happened to get famous for its wide-eyed, innocent hero worship. This, however, is the sound of a band trying desperately to get back to that exuberance, and failing.</p></div>"|14978.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14978-outside/|5.5|Grayson Currin

He cast a wide net, from the krautrock-ish Emeralds to the haunted sound of post-Burial dubstep. But he also noted that, whatever the subgenre, the vibe of ""much of it [is] specifically rooted in the apocalyptic aesthetics of the mid-80s,"" a time when Cold War horror seemed to leak into even the dance-your-cares-away world of club music.</p>
<p>Perhaps no new act exemplifies this aesthetic as much as sometime Salem associates Gatekeeper. From its cover art (an Atari cartridge meets the <a href=""http://www.fantagraphics.com/index.php?option=com_myblog&amp;show=Portable-Grindhouse-The-Lost-Art-of-the-VHS-Box---Previews-Pre-Order.html&amp;Itemid=113"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Portable Grindhouse</i></a> aesthetic?) to its sound, <i>Giza</i> is a slab of carefully reconstituted 80s synths. Gatekeeper combine elements of mid-period Cabaret Voltaire (the eerie, unintelligible sampled moans and growls), the most sinister stalking-you-down-a-dark-alley strains of Detroit techno (think Suburban Knight more than Derrick May), and the on-the-cheap choral grandeur of every keyboard-owning ""composer"" ever tasked to rip off Vangelis' score for <i>Blade Runner</i>.</p>
<p>Obviously Gatekeeper's members are neck-deep in nostalgia for this era. Not for nothing is <i>Giza</i>'s accompanying video collection being released on VHS. That kind of over-the-top commitment to retro is rare indeed. But still, do we really need another spot-the-reference exercise from a couple of guys who never quite got over the 80s?</p>
<p>We do when it's executed with this kind of audacity and intensity. Sure, <i>Giza</i>'s period detail is exquisitely rendered, with a bright and crisp sound in direct opposition to the digital murk of the witch house crew. But though Gatekeeper clearly know their history, this is miles from the stuffy, deadening world of vintage keyboard connoisseurship. The vibe of <i>Giza</i> is pure suburban hoodrat thrills, over-amped electronic music made for teenage metalheads playing coin-op games in grotty strip mall arcades. And despite Gatekeeper's audible love for Z-grade horror flicks, this isn't really bleak stuff. Gatekeeper realize that there's also lot of kitschy joy to be had with such superficially spooky materials, and at its best <i>Giza</i> offers the same kind of brute adrenaline rush this stuff gave good-natured darkness junkies the first time around.</p></div>"|14980.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14980-giza-ep/|7.7|Jess Harvell

The Baltimore trio was preparing to play unplugged for the first time at a local gallery, and to supplement their live set-up, they enlisted a cellist, drummer, and guitarist. The recordings of these sessions were laid down for broadcast on WYPR's ""The Signal"", then set to vinyl for <i>Undressed</i>, a limited 12"" release. It's a quick but promising listen, the clear, fundamental beauty of every song's construction on full display.</p>
<p>Future Islands' sound is built largely around electronic textures both dense and lush, as well as the stubbled vocals of Samuel Herring. Stripping the former away has made more breathing room for the latter, and the result is compelling. Herring's vocals typically bring to mind Tom Waits, but here, they're all over the map and, thankfully, still over the top. Opener ""In The Fall"" makes good use of every instrument available before Herring makes his entrance, his voice transitioning from reptilian hiss to growl to Antony-like flutter. And all that extra space in a song allows for Herring's grandiosely phrased stories to take even clearer shape.</p>
<p>While none of the arrangements here do any disservice to their counterparts, a couple find a way to channel what made them good starting points.  ""Little Dreamer"", one of Future Islands' finest and a song that's already been remixed along with the added vocals of fellow Baltimore-native Victoria Legrand of Beach House, is the best example. Originally a cavernous, drum machine-based dirge, here it becomes a snaggle-toothed lullaby. The moaning synth is gone, as is the echo, and what's left is a great deal of beauty, both lyrically and musically. <i>Undressed</i> would suggest Future Islands have plenty more in store.</p></div>"|14972.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14972-undressed-ep/|7.1|David Bevan

Their debut was a blend of 1960s rock swagger, infectious melodies, and wry humor, becoming a minor cult hit among the DIY set and receiving both <a href=""http://www.lastplanetojakarta.com/2010/01/a_few_words_about_a_live_clip.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">an enthusiastic rave</a> by John Darnielle and an opening slot for his Mountain Goats on tour in 2010. <i>Stay Home</i> finds the band using the attention they've received as inspiration to clean up their act... a little.</p>
<p>While <i>Spit in the Face</i>-- described by the band as ""a collection of 12 songs about being cool""-- executed the ""cool"" concept right down to its outrageously limited run of 200 physical copies and hand-drawn, Crayola-core cover art, <i>Stay Home</i> is (spoiler alert) ""a collection of 13 new songs about staying home."" ""This ain't paranoia, no it's not,"" sing guitarist Juan Wauters and bassist Jose Garcia in unison on ""Hens &amp; Roosters"", debunking any notion that the album was created by a group of Chicken Littles crouched in fear of the sky crumbling around them. But the record is very much about staying home, whether parking your behind in front of the boob tube (the raucous and charmingly amateurish ""Watching TV""), hanging out with your old man (""Pops N Me""), or doing the same with the person you love (""Your Name Is on My Bones"").</p>
<p>With delivery split between singing and barking, the relative clarity of Garcia and Wauters' voices benefit their songs greatly-- as opposed to the last album, you can <i>almost</i> make out the lyrics. Still, they're buried far enough in the mix that the vocals are just another instrument, equal with all other components of the songs. The near-sneer in songs like ""Dead"" and ""Knock on Wood"" nestle in perfectly with the arcane chord changes, while ""Pops N Me"" features call-and-response vocals that accurately replicate the comedic, exaggerated singing of 60s musicals and sitcoms. Though there have always been plenty of bands mining the same era, with reverbed vocals and drummers that don't sit down, <i>Stay Home</i> captures attitude and devil-may-care confidence better than most of today's bands worth their weight in <i>Nuggets</i> compilations.</p></div>"|14954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14954-stay-home/|7.6|Martin Douglas

As a self-consciously confrontational experiment in all-out agitprop and industrial sonic overload, that recordÂ had snarl and ambition but little of the sassy snap and sidelong force of her first two classics, <i>Arular</i> and <i>Kala</i>. For all her bombs-exploding imagery and global-warchild empathy, M.I.A. always came off like a smart, arty, round-the-way girl who, it happened, had seen some shit; she was concerned about the fate of her homeland and about the text messages on her man's phone, and those concerns coexisted in nervous harmony. <i>/\/\/\Y/\</i> replaced that persona with a near-humorless conspiracy theorist who really seemed to think the government controlled Facebook.</p>
<p>But with her new <i>Vicki Leekx</i> mixtape, M.I.A. buries her 2010 with a single, chaotic, 36-minute track. Released to the Internet on New Year's Eve, <i>Vicki Leekx</i> madly crams around 20 tracks into its runtime and channels <i>/\/\/\Y/\</i>'s furious tumult into something that sometimes slips into sheer dizzy joy.Â <i>Vicki Leekx</i> is also an experiment in steamrolling sonic overdrive. This is a busy piece of work, with noisy interruptions and song excerpts that end as soon as they begin. But it's delivered with heart and vigor and humor, and it reintroduces an M.I.A. who actually sounds like M.I.A. once again.</p>
<p><i>Vicki Leekx </i>is M.I.A.'s first mixtape since she and then-boyfriend Diplo released <i>Piracy Funds Terrorism, Vol. 1</i> more than six years ago, introducing her to the world in a blur of then-current global-pop genre-fusion. <i>Piracy Funds Terrorism</i> chased its moment, and M.I.A. existed beautifully alongside Missy Elliott and baile funk and LL Cool J's ""Headsprung"". Without Diplo playing party controller (though he does contribute some production),<i> Vicki Leekx</i> only rarely sounds specific to an instance in time. Musically, it falls right into M.I.A.'s wheelhouse: fast, cheap, and out of control dance music that pulls a ton from Baltimore club and old-school rave but never settles into anything you could nail down as an actual genre.</p>
<p>A couple ofÂ <i>/\/\/\Y/\</i> tracks show up here in stridently altered form, pushed toward party-anthem status. The tape's itchy beats dissolve into each other with head-whirl speed, and its momentum flags only at the end, when a series of slower tracks force things into the wrong gear. And periodically, a digitized female voice-- the record's title character-- floats in to add Internet-age sloganeering, like an insurrectionist version of the robotic tour guide from A Tribe Called Quest's <i>Midnight Marauders</i>.</p>
<p>But despite its title, <i>Vicki Leekx</i> isn't a blast of political turmoil. Instead, it's M.I.A. tuning back into everyday life and micro-level personal relationships. One song, without any detectable irony, is titled ""Let Me Hump You"", and it's pretty much exactly what you'd expect. Another, ""Super Tight"", finds M.I.A. using sex as a weapon: ""You better be big boy kryptonite because I got my shit down super tight."" ""Gen-N-E-Y"" seems to target old frienemy Diplo. And the harshest blast of bile, ""Marsha/Britney"", is a scathing attack on ""bitches who are fame hoes,"" or, more specifically, a girl who ""wanna be a model for American Apparel"" and ""always claim she's part native Navajo."" Even in a brilliantly petty snarl like this, though, M.I.A. uses politics just to give her taunts a little extra bite: ""Your shoes could feed a village; you should think about that.""</p>
<p>In its brief onslaught of sneery fun, <i>Vicki Leekx</i> only occasionally reaches the dizzy pop heights of <i>Arular</i> and <i>Kala</i>. But it does give us an M.I.A. who, once again, seems to be having a blast doing what she's doing. And it's great to learn this M.I.A. still exists. I'd sigh with relief if the thing hadn't left me breathless.</p></div>"|14970.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14970-vicki-leekx/|7.8|Tom Breihan

Kelly can knock out exquisitely slick, universally appealing hits in his sleep. But there's also no denying that Kelly's a real-deal eccentric, in his art as in his life. If Kelly's seemed to court a geek-show level of appreciation lately, it's sad but understandable. Because embracing those eccentricities, cranking up the outlandishness-- often at the expense of everything else-- has resulted in some really bad records over the past few years.</p>
<p>For some Kelly fans, his excesses of personality are the crux of his appeal. For others, they're something you have to listen past (or suffer through) to enjoy the more everyday pleasures like, oh, killer hooks, effortless funk, some of the best singing in R&amp;B. <i>Love Letter</i> is different in almost every way than the Kelly we've gotten to know over the last decade, good news for those who prefer solid soul records to train wrecks.</p>
<p>All of the forehead-slapping elements of Kelly's more recent work-- the sex metaphors, the seemingly free-associated multi-character narratives, the ego-tripping over the idea that everyone is inherently fascinated with the workings of R. Kelly's weird-ass brain regardless of the quality of the tunes-- have been dialed back considerably. No one will be backhandedly praising <i>Love Letter</i> for its camp. The music itself, a gorgeously rendered tribute to a certain swathe of R&amp;B history, is praiseworthy enough, as is Kelly's frequently ignored voice.</p>
<p>Not to say that Kelly could ever keep from indulging himself a little. By the third track he's already comparing the object of his affection (positively) not only to <i>Avatar</i> but <i>Coming to America</i>. Dumb-assed double-entendres and ""okay, <i>really</i>?"" moments are still strewn throughout <i>Love Letter</i>. But their infrequency makes them feel charmingly silly again, and nowhere does Kelly drop a groaner on the level of ""sexasaurus.""</p>
<p>Perhaps realizing he was alienating his grown-folks base, and how silly he'd sound hopping on one of will.i.am's jumped-up ringtones, Kelly claims here that he wants to ""bring the love songs back to the radio."" And, for Kelly, growing up also means looking back. Once he moved away from the lung-bursting swingbeat come-ons that made his name, his albums have been sometimes ungainly (and often over-long) agglomerations of styles. On <i>Love Letter</i> he sticks tightly to the stuff that shaped the now 43-year-old singer/songwriter/producer as an adolescent and early twentysomething.</p>
<p>I think people have been mislead by the cover art, and Kelly's own pre-release hype, because <i>Love Letter</i> is no way a strict recreation of 60s soul. The time frame that's referenced here is much broader, taking in the classic Motown era (""Radio Message"") but also drawing as much from the smoother-than-smooth pop-soul of the 70s (""Just Like That"") and the pre-new jack swing of the 80s (""Number One Hit""). A few outright and faithful homages to the Marvin/Smokey era aside, Kelly smears these period references-- tremulous Hi Records guitars, popping SOS Band bass, the percussion of Michael Jackson's disco years-- into unexpected combinations. The songs don't feel like 2010, but they're harder to pin to any one decade than Kelly's press might have you believing.Â While it's easier to excite people who might be indifferent (or antagonistic) to Kelly's music by invoking the Four Tops rather than LaVert, <i>Love Letter</i> is much more gliding, quiet-storm retro than ""American Bandstand"" retro.</p>
<div>There are some inexplicably cheapÂ production choices that are obviously intentional, moments when Kelly's bad taste still gets the betterÂ of him. The synthesized faux-opulence of ""When a Woman Loves"" grates hard, especially givenÂ Kelly's Apollo-leveling vocal, the grittiest performance onÂ <i>Love Letter</i>.Â But from the pillow-soft ""Just Like That"" to the sparely deployed orchestral ornament that swells between the warm empty spaces of ""Music Must Be a Lady"",Â <i>Love Letter</i> is mostly poised, polished, and lush beyond belief. And despite being the preeminent R&amp;B thug, there's zilch in the way of hip-hop hardness. That goes double for Kelly's singing, which is a marvel throughout. His vocals are at their best when he's more insinuating than showy, when he remembers the sly, bouncy, conversational come-on works best. OnÂ <i>Love Letter</i>, he's as often whispering in your ear as filling the room.</div>
<p>Even with that amount of craft and care involved, it might be easy to hear <i>Love Letter</i> as a slight project, a work of loving, comfortable pastiche rather than someone pushing himself. It certainly lacks the batshit breadth of his less successful recent work. But given the often ignoble results, maybe R. Kelly has pushed himself enough over the last 10 years. Perhaps this back-to-basics move will remind him of where his true talents lie, that his ""easy"" stuff, the slow jams and the steppers, will endure longer than the half-deranged performance art of ""Trapped in the Closet"" or ""Real Talk"". And even if it's a sugary, one-off trifle, it's a compulsively listenable one all the same.</p></div>"|14967.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14967-love-letter/|8.2|Jess Harvell

With most of dubstep's appeal already fully present in the bass-heavy sonics of its more traditional practitioners, where else is there to go with a dub remix? For dubstep producers, the most memorable remixes are exercises in rhythmic tweaking or deeply altered melodic interplay-- drawing on the lineage of 2-step, hardcore, jungle, and UK funky to fundamentally reconstruct a track's beat. But the great dub producers of the 1970s and 80s worked more closely with the rhythms they already had, opting to further draw out low-end dynamics through engineering tricks and manipulating the space between the beats. When a track already uses those dynamics to start with, how much deeper is there to go?</p>
<p>The spirit of a somewhat redundant ""meta-dub"" is the big Catch-22 with <i>Scientist Launches Dubstep Into Outer Space</i>, and it's a problem that's at least somewhat sidestepped. If you're familiar enough with the likes of <i>Scientist Encounters Pac-Man </i>or <i>Scientist Rids the World of the Evil Curse of the Vampires</i>, it's not hard to imagine the dub producer's aesthetic-- mile-deep bass, cavernous drums, notes split apart and phased across space and time-- applied to the artists on the Tectonic roster. Of course, that's also a prime aesthetic of the Tectonic roster itself, so what Scientist adds to the songs on this collection, if anything, is a subtler alteration. When he gets into the innards of a track, he can use a few well-placed shifts in emphasis to create entirely new moods: Kode9 &amp; Spaceape's ""Abeng"" is twisted inside out into a more tense buildup, and after stripping all the elastic bounce out of Jack Sparrow's ""Red Sand"", he makes it hiss and bristle turbulently. When he sticks to the surface-- well, I'm still trying to find the differences between Guido's ""Korg Back"" and Scientist's dub, aside from a bit more echo somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>That said, this compilation's character is a bit deceptive. Despite the noble, if sporadically executed, attempt to connect dubstep to its roots, the real draw of this collection is the new and unreleased recordings from artists on the Tectonic label. And no complaints on that front-- unearthed tracks from the likes of Shackleton, King Midas Sound, and Roly Vex'd are always welcome. Those three artists alone should give you an idea of the scope Scientist had to work with: The spacious percussive austerity of ""Hackney Marshes"", the lovers-rock shudder of ""U"", and the assaultive wobble of ""The Long Way"" are evidence enough of dubstep's ability to redefine its own parameters. Factor in the aforementioned Guido track's glimmering futurism, the borderline-gothic trip-hop nod of Pinch &amp; Emika's ""2012"", and the muffled, low-slung intensity of long-lost Mala cut ""City Cycle""-- previously available only as a radio rip-- and you've got as wide an outlook of the genre as you can ask for. That a crucial forefather was given the opportunity to tinker with it all? That's a pretty choice bonus.</p></div>"|14963.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14963-scientist-launches-dubstep-into-outer-space/|7.7|Nate Patrin

With Oblivians and especially Reigning Sound, he has documented love's fallout from an inescapably male perspective, painting women as both the perpetrators and victims of emotional violence. Men suffer and inflict just as much pain, which means the genders are pretty well matched in his songs. Yet, aside from a brief dalliance with the Detroit Cobras, we rarely hear from the other parties in his songs or get any other side to his sad stories. The Parting Gifts, however, provide a Loretta to his Conway, a Nancy to his Lee-- namely, Coco from the Ettes.</p>
<p>The band itself is a pick-up group featuring, among others, Cartwright, members of the Ettes and the Greenhornes/Dead Weather, and (at least on record) Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys. But Cartwright (who produced the Ettes' most recent album, <i>Do You Want Power) </i>and Coco are the two mainstays, writing and singing almost everything on the band's debut, <i>Strychnine Dandelion</i>. Coco may not possess the same eloquent despair Cartwright conveys so effortlessly, but she does have a youthful sass and smartass phrasing that contrasts eloquently with his more mature hound-dog burr. On ""Bound to Let Me Down"", they trade verses like jaded lovers, exchanging blame and recrimination with wine-tinged kisses: ""How do you stand so straight when your mind is so crooked?"" they ask each other, before concluding with a mutual kiss-off: ""Walk your crooked mile and think of me.""</p>
<p>That's actually the only song from <i>Strychnine Dandelion</i> to feature vocals from both of them, but it's enough to flesh out all the you's in their songs and to create a he said/she said vibe throughout the album. Cartwright gets more songwriting credits than Coco does, but ultimately it sounds pretty well balanced, with each airing their romantic grievances and subtly pushing the other out of his or her comfort zone. Sounding like a young Tammy Wynette working with a pre-crazy Phil Spector, Coco anchors ""My Mind's Made Up"" and ""Born to Be Blue"" in specific predicaments-- a love triangle, an abrupt departure-- and makes them sound like supercharged Ettes tracks.</p>
<p>Cartwright opens the album with ""Keep Walkin'"", a strident, catchy number that sounds like a refugee from Reigning Sound's last album, but he stretches out as the album progresses, enlivening ""My Baby Tonight"" with an Elvis lip curl and instilling ""Shine"" with the sweet excitement of a secret crush. The Gifts themselves are surprisingly versatile, especially for a pick-up band. They kick out ""Staring"" with the jittery rumble of early Love, then instill the cover of the Stones' ""(Walking Through the) Sleepy City"" with a DIY wall of sound. Stylistically, <i>Strychnine Dandelion</i> is all over the place, but that pan-60s diversity may be one of its most winning traits, as the Gifts make everything sound lively and modern. It's unclear whether the band will end up being a one-off, but even if there's no follow-up, <i>Strychnine Dandelion </i>has already fulfilled its mission by making Cartwright and Coco sound rejuvenated and ready for another round of heartbreaks.</p></div>"|14969.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14969-strychnine-dandelion/|7.5|Stephen M.

The spry indie-poppers-- headed by Beirut associate Paul Collins, with that band's Perrin Cloutier on drums here-- cut their ebullient tunes with snatches of TropicÃ¡lia, mariachi, samba, and Balearic beat. You name it, they dabble in it, but unlike their sometime-boss Zach Condon-- who delves into his disparate source material head on-- Soft Landing let their ex-pat dalliances color the tunes rather than drive them. They move confidently through these bouncy mutlicultural flourishes, liberally draping brassy keyboard fanfares and shimmering dancefloor textures onto their sprightly songs. But their breezy melodies are both outshined and outweighed by their arrangements; the sound's there, but the songs underneath could stand a little more fleshing out.</p>
<p>Collins' voice is warm and sweet, if not the most expressive; he's got much of Condon's sustain but little of his vibrato, and he sings the tunes with a sort of pleasant, everyman ease. A few clever turns aside, his lyrics are similarly serviceable, almost cute; ""Ibiza"" is about a dancefloor, ""Papaya"" a gentleman's surname. In ""Mic Check"", ""this love"" is real, but ""this world"" isn't, and that's just about all you'll learn. The songs-- largely strummy, mid-tempo acoustic things-- flit by amicably enough, but stripped of their window dressing, they're fairly straightforward, unsurprising in their construction. The lightness in tone, the crisp recording, and especially all the judiciously applied instrumental touches give <i>Soft Landing</i> its character; without them, as on the comparatively unadorned ""Pendleton Woolen"", the album slips into competent anonymity.</p>
<p>Still, those arrangements really are something; despite its goofy lyric, ad execs ought be on high alert for the immediately appealing chunky Spanish guitar rave-up of ""Mic Check"", and the recent glut of Balearic-influenced dance tracks doesn't make the faux-naif ""Ibiza"" knock any less. Keyboard gurgles and percussive explosions pop up around nearly all of Collins' melodies; they're not meant to be the focal point, but when the songs themselves don't have much to offer, there's always something else going on.Â But fun's fun, and while at this point Soft Landing's buoyant, uncomplicated tunes aren't much more, they're also rarely anything less.</p></div>"|14961.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14961-soft-landing/|6.7|Paul Thompson

This is the nearest we have got to seeing what I would call a universal machine."" That's British artist David Hockney talking about the iPad. Hockney does sketches on his, using an app called Brushes, and several of his works are already hanging this month in an exhibition at the Pierre BergÃ©-Yves Saint Laurent Foundation in Paris. Hockney is presumably drawn to the novelty as much as to the functionality of Apple's curious device, which is like a big iPhone that won't make calls, or like a small laptop without a keyboard. Rather than render it redundant or limited, those disabilities have made it as universal as Hockney attests, attracting hundreds of thousands of users ranging from my mom to Damon Albarn, who recorded the new Gorillaz album on his iPad.</p>
<p><i>The Fall</i>, released for free on Christmas, is a nice marketing gimmick and the product of Albarn's restlessness on tour. While Hockney's sketches clearly look like they were done on some kind of computer, nothing about Albarn's songs reveals their origins. Instead, <i>The Fall</i> possesses the crisply eccentric production value of a typical Gorillaz album, which may be a testament to the iPad's ability to manipulate and combine sound files with little loss of fidelity or complexity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it doesn't appear to handle hip-hop very well. <i>The Fall</i> contains opens stretches of loping, belching beats that are painstakingly crafted yet often sound like they've been created as backdrops for MC cameos. But there's only one guest, a barely recognizable Bobby Womack on ""Bobby in Phoenix""; otherwise, it's Albarn singing and creating songs, which gives <i>The Fall</i> the feel of a solo album. At times it needs other voices to liven up some of these long stretches. Even so, it's fitting that Albarn has released it under the Gorillaz moniker. For one thing, that band has always had a strong visual component that makes the cartoon/hologram characters seem like they were meant to be up- and downloaded, so it's not hard to imagine them trapped in an iPad like General Zod at the end of <i>Superman II</i>.</p>
<p>Songs like ""Revolving Doors"" and ""Detroit"" have the same hazily martial beats that have marked the Gorillaz' output since ""Clint Eastwood"", which makes <i>The Fall</i> slot neatly into the Gorillaz catalog. It's less a proper album like Demon Days or Plastic Beach-- more an auxiliary item like that live album or that G-Sides comp or that remix album (or, in Albarn's career as a whole, like his lowkey, homemade Democrazy set.) Albarn's mode may be somber and road-weary, but there's not a whole lot of heft here, which means it sounds like a unified outtakes record rather than a major statement. Thematically, it's a tour album, leaving behind the Pacific Ocean trash island of Plastic Beach for the highways of America, evoked in songs named after Phoenix, Aspen, Dallas, Detroit, Seattle, and Amarillo. With its rangey beats and garbled transmission noises, ""The Parish of Space Dust"" imagines a Texas as expansive as the cosmos, but it's just enough to make you wish Albarn had incorporated some southwestern influences the way Plastic Beach used island rhythms to bolster its setting.</p>
<p>Despite the emphasis on atmosphere that pervades the album and that seems like a necessary byproduct of its creative technology, <i>The Fall</i> may be the most earthbound Gorillaz album yet-- and at times, therefore, the most banal. At his best, Albarn manages to create an alien ambience, as if visiting America has made him feel as out-of-place as certain travelers must have felt around Roswell. Still, he's always passing through, never stopping for a visit, and as a result, <i>The Fall</i> is a blur. Whether as an album or as a touring document, it doesn't add up to much of a statement, which means the particulars of its creation will probably always overshadow whatever life this album may find.</p></div>"|14966.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14966-the-fall/|5.8|Stephen M.

In late November, the pop polymaths gave away single ""Let Them"" and promised to leave a free, new mixtape beneath the tree onÂ Christmas Eve. And there it was,  glistening on the Sincerely Yours website when the 24th came: A download  link, well worth the wait. <i>Kills</i> is a true mixtape in both  senses of the word. First, like the American rap tapes they seem to love  (they've toyed with a lot of non-mixtape material as well as R&amp;B  covers in the past), much of this outing finds Elin Kastlander laying  her vaporous vocals over other people's samples. It's all  very tongue-in-cheek but at its core, <i>Kills</i>, which features a version of the ""Let Them"" single re-titled ""Kill Them"", also plays like the kind of  tape one fan/nerd might give as a gift, but with a twist. These are  songs and samples and scraps of melody they clearly loved enough to share.</p>
<p>jj boast a peerless melodic sensibility, and on this tape they're at once disorienting and exhilarating. You may  even LOL every now and then.Â Because there's a lot of fun to be  found in hearing, say, the hydraulicized pluck of Dr. Dre's ""Still  D.R.E."" slice through Kastlander's goofy, weed-heavy, Weezy-saluting  whispers on opener ""Still"". Or in ""Die Tonight"", a Frankenstein of a  track that opens with Kastlander lifting lines from Robyn's ""Hang With  Me"" before vaulting into a dance-pop floor banger sewn together with a  sample from Taio Cruz's ""Dynamite"". Though underrated, stretches of <i>nÂ° 3</i> did sound as though they had been  left incomplete or drained of all the color that made its predecessor so  vibrant. Even when smoked out or slowed down, <i>Kills</i> still teems with  energy and both Kastlander and Joakim Benon, chameleons that they are,  blend into snippets of song just as well as they shift gears between  genres.</p>
<p>A lot of that is due to how well they can identify the  potential for a new song in someone else's. ""Kill
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
You"" for example,  takes M.I.A.'s ""Paper Planes"" and transforms it into a torch-wielding  break-up hymn. Kastlander riffs on the chorus, Benon adds a cushion of  synths that sound like they could part clouds, and wham, you hear a new  interpretation of a song (and its raised gun sample) that could go over  fine in the quiet of a church. On ""New Work"", the duo takes the piano  melody from Jay-Z's ""Empire State of Mind"" and makes it the chassis for a  song about being young and starry-eyed elsewhere. And then there's  ""Angels"", which clips a Biggie Smalls vocal from a Diddy-Dirty Money  track and bookends it with 2Pac's ""Changes"". Thankfully, this sort of  conceptual relief saves the whole affair from being a slew of  stonerizations and Auto-Tuned faux-swagger, which, by the way, still  somehow ends up wreaking of swagger.</p>
<p>But in the end, as  energizing as it tends to be, <i>Kills</i> feels more like a one-off stopgap  between original jj full-lengths, an illuminating detour for  creativity's sake. The album's climax, ""Boom"", stitches together three  distinct pieces of Kanye's latest opus and then boldly tacks on blasts  from Hans Zimmer's <i>Inception</i> score for even more gusto. When that ""can  we get much higher?"" sampling from ""Dark Fantasy"", drifts in, it's not  clear whether jj are referencing weed again or simply commenting on some  music they love. But when Kastlander hums over the last few bars of  ""Runaway"", the two seem one in the same. This is how they sing along.</p></div>"|14971.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14971-kills/|7.6|David Bevan

By neatly riding the tightrope connecting deep house restraint to more straightforward and populist impulses, the Hamburg-based producer hit a winning formula. The track became a hit in a diverse range of clubs and was re-released on the Defected label after its initial run on the more niche-oriented Permanent Vacation. It was even accompanied by a risquÃ© video complete with dancing nymphets. Tensnake's follow-up, this 2xCD mix, ties together several strains of underground house that have achieved considerable currency in the past five years. It serves as a solid summation of the weird place dance music finds itself in 2011 and celebrates the genre's strengths while stubbornly sticking to its weaknesses. So as strong as the selections are, it feels more like Tensnake is in a holding pattern and falls short of suggesting a new direction.</p>
<p>While mainstream dance conquers the pop charts for the first time since the <i>Jock Jams</i> era (the Black Eyed Peas, David Guetta, etc.), the post-dubstep diaspora is challenging underground dance music's hold on its audience from the other direction. In the middle, the international polyglot of dance producers and DJs continues to build upon the trends of the past few years, reviving disco, 1980s boogie, Italo, Balearic beats, Detroit techno, and deep and acid house-- a constellation of sounds laid out in weekly Beats in Space podcasts. Of late, this scene seemed further disconnected from any sense of zeitgeist, which is why ""Coma Cat""'s popular appeal was such a significant victory. It offered this scene a hero who not only played by the rules but also worked like an alchemist to transform varying influences into pop-house anthem gold.</p>
<p>On <i>In the House</i>, Tensnake largely succeeds at outlining an aesthetic that reflects this careful balance between hip references and hedonistic populism. He's a producer with a diverse range of trendy influences, but more importantly, he loves hooks, romantic emotionalism, and the kind of notes that easily pluck heartstrings on a dancefloor. The bulk of the first disc traces through these unabashed pop moves, with a heavy focus on disco. Tensnake's own ""Need Your Lovin'"" is a love-letter to 80s post-disco R&amp;B that appears on the first disc; thankfully, he uses its ""dub mix"" here, as the original version veers close to Chromeo-style pastiche. An easy highlight of the first disc is Prins Thomas' remix of Al Usher's ""Lullaby for Robert"", a gorgeous instrumental that masterfully builds euphoric intensity through repetition. Tensnake also makes a clever connection with Michael Mayer's ""Amanda"" from 2000's Kompakt <i>Total 2</i>, a house edit of 80s Italo track ""Precious Little Diamond"" by Fox the Fox. Mayer's version appears prescient when considering the edits craze that took hold in the latter half of the decade.</p>
<p>The second disc shifts into more muscular territory, relying on the kind of sexualized grooves and trance-inducing repetition that characterized the classic Chicago house sound. Again, disco-infused classics, like Heaven &amp; Earth's ""Prescription Every Night"" and DJ Sneak's filter house reconstruction of Chaka Khan's ""Clouds"" (""In Da Clouds"") make their way into the mix, but this time, it's done in the service of a more aggressive, mechanized dancefloor sound. After the disc's ""Coma Cat"" apex, Tensnake increases the energy by building to an edit of legendary Chicago producer Armando's spiraling acid track ""Don't Take It"" before resolving to the traditional gospel-house of Phase II's ""Reachin"".  The second disc, while not a brave new world for house heads, does capture some novelty in contrasting different approaches to physicality.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, Tensnake's mix suffers because it epitomizes a style that seems calcified, as the trends of the last few years overstay their welcome. Tiger &amp; Woods ""Dr. Burner"" is a solid disco edit, with an emotionally moving core, and it's hard to fault a rarity like Carol Williams ""Can't Get Away (From Your Love)"" or the untouchable Shirley Lites instrumental. Yes, the music is timeless-- ""Heat You Up (Melt You Down)"" is a staple for Chicago house DJs for as long as I can remember-- but those DJs are working in a long-running tradition, rather than mapping out a contemporary scene. <i>In the House</i>, as great as its selection is, feels more like a state-of-the-union celebration a few days into the decline. One possible ""out"" for producers to consider is the one that Classixx, who work in a similar vein of populist underground dance, have moved toward in the past few years-- to engage in a dialog with contemporary pop music. Or consider 2010 dance successes like Deadboy's re-edit of Drake's ""Fireworks"", or Soul Clap's remix of R. Kelly. These data points don't quite feel like a movement at this point, but they do offer a potential direction for house producers focused on the history books.</p></div>"|14965.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14965-in-the-house/|7.9|David Drake

After an underrated 2009 debut LP of mostly instrumental electro-pop, <i>Continent</i>, followed by last year's slightly more scattershot <i>Drifts</i> remix EP, the Montreal producer known as CFCF takes inspiration for his latest from <i>Fitzcarrald</i>o, a 1982 Werner Herzog film about an Irish rubber baron who wants to build an opera in the Peruvian jungle-- but first must haul a riverboat up a small mountain. In keeping with its source, <i>The River</i> EP is cinematic, slow-paced, and more organic-sounding than previous CFCF releases, almost a mini-soundtrack in its own right.</p>
<p>There are still moments of remarkable beauty here, but you have to wade a little bit deeper to find them. <i>The River</i> is at its best when its productions feel most contemporary. See ""Frozen Forest"", with its Fever Ray-frosty synths, JosÃ© GonzÃ¡lez-hued acoustic guitar, and R&amp;B slow-jam breakbeats. Another standout is the six-and-half-minute title track, all panpipe-like synths and urgent tribal pounding until a sudden, exhilarating crescendo that might evoke the image of Fitzcarraldo's vessel finally cresting-- and tumbling-- over the hillside. Elsewhere, the EP's more directly nostalgic tracks, whether the krautrock chorale of ""Upon the Hill"" (which distinctly recalls Popol Vuh's soundtrack for Herzog's film) or the opening and closing ambient synth pieces, are no less elegant and foreboding, though they do tend to drag. For whatever it's worth, you won't find any of the movie's signature Caruso arias.</p>
<p>Like <i>Fitzcarraldo</i> itself, <i>The Rive</i>r EP isn't a perfect, unified statement. The digital bonus version (included with vinyl purchases) swells to more than 50 minutes-- longer than many albums-- and includes two epic ""Frozen Forest"" remixes. Luckily, both Brooklyn producer/DJ Jacques Renault's no-guitars house rework and UK Balearic duo Coyote's elastic scrawl are rewarding enough in isolation. A catchy, concise remix of hypnotic ambient trip ""It Was Never Meant to Be This Way"" by Games, the duo of Oneohtrix Point Never's Daniel Lopatin and Tiger City's Joel Ford, similarly amps up the dancefloor potential. On the other hand, a big part of <i>Fitzcarraldo</i>'s appeal is that its director was as mad as its protagonist, filming his story on location and without special effects. ""It's a land which God, if he exists, has created in anger,"" Herzog would later say.

But rather than strain against one's limitations, the Glasgow sextet displayed rigorous poise on that record. They were playing with heavy stuff-- Can, Beefheart, Waits, to name a few-- but with the help of producer Paul Savage (formerly of the Delgados), they produced a stately, distinctly British, and often impressive record that never let them get ahead of themselves.</p>
<p>Little more than a year later, you can take the title of <i>The Wants </i>as an indication of a hunger for more. While Phantom Band maintained their motorik song structure and instrumental curiosity, these songs are more fluid, polar, and knottier, matching with the hovering environmental dread of Richard Anthony's lyrics. If you're a junkie for production ethics and have high-fived someone due to a really awesome job of stereo panning or a bassoon recorded <i>just right</i>, this thing is a field day. Though mallet percussion plays as integral a role as guitars, <i>The Wants </i>is never cluttered for its own sake, still sounding like a couple of guys jamming out in a room with an inordinate amount of toys. But the richest instrument in their arsenal remains Anthony's vocals-- a wisened Scottish burr that particularly carries gravitas in his preferred lower register.</p>
<p>Anthony's capable of donning a number of seemingly contradictory guises: His near-falsetto shines on the New Romanticism of ""O"", and his bristling vocals save both the otherwise forthright ""Come Away in the Dark"" and the first, adult-contemporary half of ""The None of One"". The singer's versatility ultimately becomes the humanizing and distinguishing characteristic amidst these ornate dioramas, whose construction recalls that of peers like Elbow or the Divine Comedy, bands that tend to their songs almost like museum curators instead of rock bands.</p>
<p>But that's the problem with museums: Only in rare cases are you allowed to interact with them. As impressive as their studio work ethic is, too little of <i>The Wants </i>sticks around once you exit. Take ""Everybody Knows It's True"": The layering and panning of the band's harmonies are an impressive feat of arrangement, but like so much of <i>The Wants</i>, it trudges forward, unable to build momentum through tempo or melody. I think back to These New Puritans' <i>Hidden </i>as a record that also swore off easy hooks; yet that band realized that if you're going to eschew big hooks or direct lyrics, you need some bust-your-shit-open beats or unorthodox textures to make up for it. Phantom Band build patiently, but the too-rare moments of catharsis-- the double-time rave-up after the expertly restrained acoustic section of ""None of One"", the apocalyptic drum clatter that ends ""Goodnight Arrow""-- only stresses how <i>The Wants </i>is an admirable record that could've used a few more fist pumps and fewer golf claps.</p></div>"|14939.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14939-the-wants/|6.5|Ian Cohen

They were  nominated for a Grammy. They returned to ""Saturday Night Live"" and sold out a handful of  dates at Radio City Music Hall on the same New York block a few months  later. They attracted legal ire for their album cover, toured as far from home as Indonesia  and Singapore, and sat pretty on several year-end best-of lists. After  spending a few years as a nascent young band that could spark  conversational firestorms on topics as wide-ranging as boat shoes and  21st century colonialism, they solidified their </span><i>brand</i><span> in  2010 as a band whose willingness to write a big pop song was buttressed  in full by the fact that they could and wanted to do it very  thoughtfully. They've become polished pros, plain and simple. </span></p>
<p><span>Four days before Christmas, they capped their year by quietly releasing  an <i>iTunes Session</i> EP, recorded in September, replete with new,  brass-bolstered arrangements: two covers and four singles, one of which, ""Holiday"", was given a well-humidified rocksteady  treatment. The exclusive iTunes price tag can be a bummer, though given  how much they've grown as a live band, the great appeal here lies in  having high-quality recordings of Vampire Weekend interacting in a room  together, playing songs in ways you wouldn't normally hear.</span></p>
<p><span>That  said, every cut sparkles, especially those pulled from the band's  debut. ""A-Punk"" is a toothsome opener, multi-instrumentalist Rostam  Batmanglij pairing his chorus synths with horns that fit cleanly in an  already/expectedly tidy mix. Chris Baio's bass sounds ripe, Chris  Tomson's drumwork smart. And as one might expect, those horns sound more  stately than brash, the latter quality smartly saved for the madcap  torque of ""Cousins"", where they actually sound as though they had been  there all along. And in its form here, ""Holiday"" takes on a  refreshingly, (almost deceptively) languid quality that's a far cry from  the chug of the original.</span></p>
<p><span>Vampire  Weekend have always boasted a good ear for covers, and the pair included here are worthy individual additions to an  iTunes library. Video and mp3s of the band taking on Bruce  Springsteen's 1984 sleeper ""I'm Going Down"" have circulated online over  the past few months, though this relatively minimal rendition is by far  the strongest. Backed at first by just hushed keys and handclaps, Ezra Koenig's  feathered delivery doesn't bring the boom like the Boss' does, but it  has a soulful, backseat feel that does the song very well.  Same goes for their take on the Honeycombs' jangly ""Have I the Right"", a  serenade from 1964 that finds Koenig belting and Batmanglij getting  cheeky/improvisational on piano, with horns and sax in bloom at their side.  It's not often you hear this band playing off-script, but the result  still pops. </span></p></div>"|14958.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14958-itunes-session-ep/|8.0|David Bevan

The intervening decade of dance music seems shorter than that, though maybe it shouldn't, since ""So Weit Wie Noch Nie"" felt eternal from its first spin. ""Timeless"" sounds fatuous, but this tune seemed to exist almost outside of time, oblivious to the sedimentary accumulation of fashions and techniques that ordinarily define dance music.</p>
<p>In its pert synth-pop and soothing dreaminess (by way of its female schlager vocal), the track feels like Kompakt's quintessential moment: Much of the label's greatness, and certainly most of its distinctiveness in contemporary German techno, can be traced to its privileging of concepts alongside-- and at times above-- sonics. The novelty and inventiveness of many of its greatest records resides more in their articulation of the relationship between pop music and dance music than in pure production values.</p>
<p>By extension you could make a case for the reclusive and decidedly unprolific Paape's being one of Kompakt's most defining producers. Alongside fellow label co-owner Michael Mayer, Paape captures glints of nearly all of Kompakt's pop-minded adventurers: The wistful melancholia of Superpitcher, the utopian dazzle of Rex the Dog, the childlike openness of Justus KÃ¶hncke. Where Paape differs from Mayer is that, while the latter retains the dancefloor as the site where groove and nostalgia intersect, Paape's finest pop creations evoke the sensation of flipping the radio dial and stumbling upon a tune that seems to echo with the spirit of a memory you've forgotten; you can certainly dance to these tunes, but that fact is almost incidental to their powerful charm.</p>
<p>For all that, ""So Weit Wie Noch Nie"" could be Paape's curse, a tune so brilliant that he is doomed never to surpass it. The difficulty of Paape's task-- proving that he is more than just one inspired moment-- hangs over this otherwise fine retrospective of his past work for the label like a small question mark. Which is a shame, because <i>Kompilation</i>, if it was released as an artist's first album, would rightly be hailed as one of Kompakt's finest, an excellent balance of dancefloor functionalism and pop daring that the label has tried many times but usually failed to capture successfully.</p>
<p>Paape's intermittent use of schlager vocals makes it tempting to suggest that his expansive notion of pop-techno is his greatest skill; the evidence against this is the gimmicky oompah-schaffel of ""Ofterschwang"", which has little use except as a taster for an imaginary techno rendition of <i>Peter and the Wolf</i>. Paape's real fundamental skill, the one that inheres in almost all of the productions collected here, is his facility for the architecture of grooves, his simple, pared back and grid-like tech-house arrangements effortlessly attaining a sense of build and sweep that feels inevitable, like a slow rush of blood to your head.</p>
<p>It's for this reason that Paape is particularly well-suited to the straight compilation format: Even the collection's most anonymous moments, such as the brooding electro-house of ""Nord"", deserve to be heard in full. This skill also infects the producer's finest dancefloor cuts with a sense of perpetually building excitement and energy that might surprise the casual fan-- the melancholy, ominous ""Fruity Loops #2"" and the menacing, bleepy ""Take That"" are, if you'll forgive the phrase, dancefloor bombs.</p>
<p>Yet for all this, ""So Weit Wie Noch Nie"" and its two likeminded companions, unofficial sequel ""Mit Dir"" and the stirring, dramatic ""Come Into My Life"", stand out like beacons. These are the times when Paape's diverging talents for pop vision and groove precision snap into accord, their largesse and grandeur so undeniable that Paape's attempts at any other style can start to feel like finely wrought distractions. If <i>Kompilation</i> inspires Paape to take stock at all, hopefully he'll resolve to bite the bullet: Even if lightning doesn't strike twice, his noble failures would be hard to resist.</p></div>"|14957.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14957-kompilation/|7.9|Tim Finney

A man returns to his wife's doorstep after 20 years in an unnamed war, suffering brain damage-- a shadow of his former self. The woman takes this mournful figure in gravely, sorting through her ambivalence, bitterness, and grief by reading to him from Homer's <i>Odyssey</i>. The story's parallels to their lives-- a husband striving heroically over vast distances and years to return to his wife-- become a psychological probe for the woman to sound the depths of her shell-shocked husband's ruined mind. Speaking to him through the poem, she is able to gently coax him back from oblivion.</p>
<p>This eloquent meditation on death, memory, being lost, and homecoming is the work of three women. Playwright and poet Ellen McLaughlin wrote the incisive lyrics; Sarah Kirkland Snider composed the dreamily disquieting score; and Shara Worden, the smoky-voiced contralto of My Brightest Diamond, sings it. Together, they render the titular woman's voice with unsettling clarity.  <i>Penelope</i> is a gorgeous piece of music, but it is more-- it is also a hauntingly vivid psychological portrait, one that explores a dark scenario with a light, almost quizzical touch, finding poetic resonances everywhere.</p>
<p>Snider's score, written for the new-music ensemble Signal, is the work's worried heart. <i>Penelope</i> lives entirely inside the heads of two people who can't communicate, and her music, coursing with mute anxiety, reflects that solitude. The strings hover like low-hanging fog, repeating a few harmonically troubled chords in softly insistent strokes-- the veil of confusion that clouds the man's memories, perhaps, or the heavy silence that settles in between the newly estranged married couple.</p>
<p>This fraught suggestibility between music and theme takes <i>Penelope</i> deep beneath your skin. On ""This Is What You're Like"", Worden's character tries to remind her husband of the man he once was; when she sings the line, ""you are a man who, when the music dies away, you keep on dancing,"" the music stumbles briefly into a few bars of a half-remembered waltz.  The story opens on the woman's house by the sea; a lapping and receding violin
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
figure traces the shore while quiet gull-like cries circle overhead.</p>
<p>Snider's music lives in a netherland between richly orchestrated indie rock and straight chamber music, an increasingly populous inter-genre space that, as of yet, has produced only a few clear, confident voices. Snider is perhaps the most sophisticated of them all: No matter what perspective you bring to this album, it bears profound rewards. Shara Worden's eerily poised singing will raise the hackles of St. Vincent fans, while Snider's ambiguous sense of harmony might put classical listeners in mind of Charles Ives' similarly memory-haunted <i>Three Places in New England</i> or Arvo PÃ¤rt's elegant simplicity. The work doesn't straddle a stylistic crossroads so much as swirl together artistic currents, creating a slipstream where electric guitar, chimes, strings, drum kit, and subtle electronic touches interchange fluidly.</p>
<p>There is an obsessive quality to <i>Penelope</i>'s cellular, repeating mini-melodies, and it is echoed in McLaughlin's mantra-like lyrics. Songs hinge on poetically elusive but piercingly direct turns of phrase-- ""Can't you do that?/ Can't you hide me, God?""; ""The world is never done with you/ The world wants her travelers to stay lost."" Worden sings these words with enigmatic wisdom, investing something as vague as ""I am known for who I am"" with palpable regret. McLaughlin's words speak with wry frankness about the burdens of waiting on, and caring for, men, and this touch makes <i>Penelope</i> a feminist story, a sly reappraisal of a male-centric tale on the order of Jean Rhys'Â <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i>. Like a siren song, it cloaks rocky edges in something soft and lyrical. Beneath the placid surface, you can hear the sound of one woman's thoughts, rendered with such care and intimacy that you can sense her staring out of the record back at you.</p></div>"|14934.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14934-penelope/|8.2|Jayson Greene

If you've never heard of these musicians, then it is helpful to know that they have all played integral roles in sundry underground and mainstream rock acts of varying significance. It is also helpful to know that many musicians from the underground rock scene of the 1980s and 90s have created a second home for themselves in the world of avant-garde improvisation, much of which flourishes in downtown New York City. <i>Floored By Four</i> is such a project.</p>
<p>The album is divided into four tracks, each one named after a single member of the band. One and two are titled ""Nels"" and ""Miss Yuka"", respectively, and each is around 10 minutes long; three is titled ""Watt"", and is about four minutes long-- a pop song by comparison; the last track, ""Dougie"", is nearly 20 minutes long. Aside from ""Miss Yuka"", which has vocals-- though it is skewed to the point of barely even registering as a ""rock song""-- the other pieces are works of instrumental improvisation.</p>
<p>To call these sessions ""works"" is a stretch-- they sound less like the show and more like the soundcheck. Listening to the album, it's difficult to spot any element of inventiveness. While each track has its own identity-- swampy blues on ""Miss Yuka"", Booker T. &amp; the MG's-style swinging on ""Watt""-- the sound itself is relatively anonymous, and the album has no arc or coherence. If you played <i>Floored By Four</i> without knowing who comprised the band, you wouldn't be able to hear any of these musicians' signature styles. This album doesn't sound like inspired jamming, it sounds like directionless and purposeless noodling.</p>
<p>Since all four of these players have exhibited such distinct approaches to their respective instruments in the past, one wonders what their contributions are here. Because as it stands, one thing that is noticeably lacking from <i>Floored By Four</i> is <i>personality</i>. It could be viewed as a neat curio, or a slight peek into a group's beginnings, but little more.</p></div>"|14936.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14936-floored-by-four/|4.6|Tal Rosenberg

The group's members, Nicole Yun and Daniel Cundiff, are both integral players in an artistic collective known as the Magic Twig Community. The last word in that appellation is key, as it speaks to the close-knit, self-sustaining quality of a small unit of people who probably draw more inspiration from each other than they do from outside trends and fads. The term ""scene"" doesn't even begin to apply.</p>
<p>That physical and mental separation from hipper spheres is a very likely factor in the pleasing incongruity of Eternal Summers' sound. On the duo's debut full-length, <i>Silver</i>, Yun and Cundiff display a pretty firm grasp of two quite disparate musical styles-- jangly post-punk and dream-pop-- and only occasionally allow those styles to interact. Were they based in an indie rock hothouse, it's easy to imagine Eternal Summers feeling somewhat pressured to streamline or smooth out their sound in a way that would be more easily describable and digestible. Instead, the duo happily flits back and forth between nervy, combustible raves and languorously pretty head nods without a care for thematic cohesion. The former mode is typified by the arch, driving opener ""Disciplinarian"", the trashily fun ""Pogo"", and the yelping ""Running High"", while the swooning ""Eternal"" and sleepy ""Bully in Disguise"" (utilizing a similar dramatic chug as Coldplay's ""Yellow"", of all things) exemplify the duo's slow-burning preferences.</p>
<p>One thing that does unite the group's polarized tempos and attitudes is a resolute minimalism. The only instruments on <i>Silver</i> are guitar and drums, and Eternal Summers take no pains to mask that fact. A paramount pleasure of listening both to the album's quick sprints and its slow dances is enjoying the clarity of Yun's simple but glittering guitar lines (particularly on the beautifully spacious ""Safe at Home"") and Cundiff's spartan drums (though he does plenty on ""Salty"").</p>
<p>No one's suggesting Yun and Cundiff are doing anything necessarily groundbreaking here. Past tourmates Best Coast and the Dum Dum Girls both wed lo-fi leanings to girl-group laments, while the duo's giddier stuff owes debts to late-70s punks like the Raincoats. Still, it's nice to hear a burgeoning group pursuing a couple of different strands of music simultaneously rather than locking itself into one single niche.</p></div>"|14962.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14962-silver/|6.6|Joshua Love

Their opera about the life of Charles Darwin was many things-- foreboding, incoherent, intermittently brilliant-- but a logical follow-up toÂ <i>Silent Shout</i> it was certainly not. As a display for lunatic high-art ambition, it was kind of breathtaking. As a Knife album, it was bewildering. There were about 25 minutes of revelatory music buried in its back half, but you had to wade through hair-raising atonal mezzo-soprano shrieking and grinding sheets of industrial noise to make it there, not a journey for the faint-hearted.</p>
<p>The project threw the Knife's storyline off balance in ways that have yet to settle, which makes this two-song EP a gentle clarification of where the Swedish duo stands in 2011. ""Seeds"" was <i>Tomorrow, in a Year</i>'s one relatively straightforward club song, a pulsing house-music track that the Knife inverted with bowed-cymbal sounds and odd bursts of opera singing. Along with the 11-minute ""Colouring of Pigeons"" and ""The Height of Summer"", ""Seeds"" hinted at the luminous fusion <i>Tomorrow, in a Year</i> could have been. The two remixes here, from two very different producers, find clever and opposite ways to smuggle the Knife back into the club. Portable and Bodycode are two pseudonyms for the same brainy, restless producer: Alan Abrahams, a South African-born DJ whose music rubs up against the tension between the intellectual and the visceral. Shinedoe, meanwhile, is a deep-house DJ who runs Intacto Records and rubs shoulders with dance titans Richie Hawtin and Ricardo Villalobos.</p>
<p>Shinedoe's aesthetic might read like a mismatch for the Knife's. But her Mediterranean party sensibilities actually work as an advantage here. She lights up the duo's chilly hauteur with sensuous warmth, pouring on glittering synths and soap-bubble drums like so much dancefloor foam. Swedish singer/songwriter Jonathan Johansson's wispy singing-- ""Seeds immersed in/ S
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
alt water/ In a tank of/ Melting snow"" is the only instantly recognizable element.  Abrahams' version is darker and sleeker, with elements from the original-- the mezzo-soprano ""ahs"", the heat-lightning soft bells-- strafing by like rain-smeared headlights past a mist of moody minor-key synth pads. He retains the song's queasy menace, and produces something murmuring and insistent against Shinedoe's cheerfully bludgeoning flash. <i>Seeds</i> is a necessarily slight EP, a small gesture in between larger projects, but for those left unsettled by the uncertainty of <i>Tomorrow, in a Year</i>, it's a welcome little dispatch.</p></div>"|14955.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14955-seeds/|7.3|Jayson Greene

Adams is the patron saint of the prolific, equally beloved and reviled for his never-ending avalanche of releases, and reintroductions aren't necessary: he's never drifted out of earshot for terribly long. A follow-up to <i>Orion</i>, the limited-run, vinyl-only, sci-fi concept record he released last spring, <i>III/IV</i> was culled from the same batch of tracks that produced 2007's <i>Easy Tiger</i>. The sessions were supposedly inspired by ""the 80s, ninjas, cigarettes, sex, and pizza"", a kind of holy pentangle for kids born in the mid-70s. And despite all his bluster-- all the songs and breakdowns and books of poems and oddball interviews-- Adams insists his needs are simple, universal: All he wants, he sings, is ""Someone that loves me the way I love <i>Star Wars</i>."" Well, sure.</p>
<p><i>III/IV</i>'s closest stylistic analogue is probably 2003's bloated <i>Rock N Roll</i>-- there's more dissonance here than twang-- but these songs are controlled, balanced affairs. The Cardinals, who have been backing Adams on and off since 2005, are tight, affable, and fluid. When Adams is at his wildest, they provide a compelling counterpoint, but here, Adams is polite and mostly contained, meaning the entire record has a sheen of professionalism and proficiency that's both welcome (it certainly speaks to Adams' mental and physical health) and a tiny bit cold.</p>
<p>While he's routinely crucified for what plenty see as bumbling over-indulgence (regardless of ego, his compulsion to release records cheapens his entire discography, per the law of averages), Adams is also acutely self-aware. He's not immune to slapping his own wrist, which can make him weirdly sympathetic (""I hate myself a lot,"" he roars in opener ""Breakdown Into the Resolve""). And while his signal-to-noise ratio is permanently skewed, it's almost always worth digging through the filler to find the few indisputably great songs: ""Lovely and Blue"", ""Numbers"", ""Sewers at the Bottom of the Wishing Well"", ""Ultraviolet Light"", and ""P.S."" are all worth multiple spins. In general, Adams is at his best when he's at his most personal (a good thing, since he rarely writes about anything beyond his immediate purview), and there are plenty of confessions here, too: Although they weren't engaged until 2009, it's tempting to do an <i>Us Weekly</i> parsing of ""Dear Candy"", reading it as a frantic apology to his now-wife, Mandy Moore (her ""Candy"", a professional bit of quasi-provocative teen-pop, was a moderate hit in 1999). Over and over again, Adams is nothing if not honest (""Now I'm bored, you don't impress me, and I find you slightly terrifying,"" he crows in ""Wasteland"").</p>
<p>A fervent music fan, Adams' albums often reference his record collection, and he seems happy to pay it homage: <i>III/IV</i> dutifully nods to the Smiths and all their contemporary interpreters, as well as a slew of punk and metal bands, and, on occasion (see the meandering guitar at the end of ""Kill the Lights""), the Grateful Dead. Mostly absent are the heartbreakers-- the melancholic country songs that earned Adams accolades at the start of the decade-- but Adams is a more versatile songwriter than he gets credit for, and fans of his earlier records shouldn't scoff at this stuff. But they shouldn't get too excited, either-- <i>III/IV</i> is a fine collection of outtakes, but chances are Adams' magnum opus is still forthcoming.</p></div>"|14959.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14959-iiiiv/|6.9|Amanda Petrusich

After a disastrous tour, an arrest, a bender, and a handful of raw deals at the hands of record labels, both Toth's career and marriage had fallen apart. <i>Death Seat</i>, as recorded in Murfreesboro, feels like Toth's attempt to regroup and realign. Haunted but healing, it's the sort of LP Nashville's little brother might make. From the professional drum shuffle of ""Tiny Confessions"" to the gentle, restrained harmonies and piano chords of ""Sleepwalking After Midnight"", it shines with a certain casual polish.</p>
<p>Honestly, it's probably the version Toth <i>should</i> have released, at least if he delights in the prospect of commercial success. Generally pretty and plenty pleasant, it's the easier sale than the version Toth eventually recorded under the auspices of Swans mastermind and Young God Records owner Michael Gira. Young God's version is rattled and haunted, with guitars and voices that sound damaged and weary. In Murfreesboro, ""Hotel Bar"" slinked playfully, its rhythm section and guitar sighs suggesting self-parody. The Young God version cans all of that, though, favoring a cheap drum machine and distant vibraphone. Toth sounds mean and prowling here. With its scenes of gunfights and invalids and its staggering, sighing guitars and strangled choir of demons, ""Ms. Mowse"" feels like a dirge for happiness. Altogether more nuanced, the second version of <i>Death Seat</i> is better suited for Toth's dark, smart, and oft-funny sketches of himself and unfortunate characters, commercial prospects be damned.</p>
<p>Even with Gira's more haunted direction, the songs here run the risk of seeming straightforward. Each uses an acoustic guitar as its foundation. But listen closely, and <i>Death Seat</i> unfurls like a large map of Toth's psyche, as full of menacing thoughts as it is good jokes and warm feelings. The writing is an intersection of outlaw country's toughness, Dylan-inspired pith, and Waits-like attentiveness and wit. It's careful and clever without forcing attention to punchlines or motives. ""Bobby"", for instance, portrays an old drunk who's frightened by the world. Toth tenderly encourages him to move on. ""Oh Bobby, oh Bobby/ The meek won't inherit a thing,"" he sings. ""So dismiss this world and fly to God/ And let these northern lights come erase what you are."" The brilliant, winking ""I Wanna Make a Difference"" seems like a prelude to a murder ballad, those age-old hymns from the hills where a lover kills his or her counterpart out of feelings forced into overdrive. ""Through your heart or through your head/ As an enemy or friend/ I wanna make a difference in your life,"" Toth opens, his voice creaking over a patient, acoustic plod. Toth's not sure if his obsession might be helpful or hurtful, but he just wants to be felt, ""Whether in protective custody/ Or on stage, my dear.""</p>
<p>The still-unreleased Murfreesboro version of <i>Death Seat</i> ends with ""Until Wrong Looks Right"", a sentimental number that finds Toth practically crooning over acoustic guitars. The song begins in first-person plural: ""We live alone/ Why do we lock the bathroom door?"" he sings, sweetly pushing for the next step of intimacy and comfort. An organ gently peals in the distance. The Young God take makes a few subtle, smart and revelatory changes, pushing the song forward so that it introduces the last third of <i>Death Seat</i>. A busted guitar wrestles with static and a sharp harmonica, and Toth opens in first person, asking the same questions about bathroom doors, set tables and uncombed hair-- only for himself this time. The change makes Toth seem paranoid and uncomfortable, a creature caged by society and habit. The song ends, though, as the other take starts, proudly in first-person plural. During the intercalary two minutes, Toth has adjusted to allow for someone else. ""I could acquiesce and go easy on the drinking,"" he sings mid-song. ""And run a comb through my hair every morning forevermore."" It's a glimmer of light on an album that's, otherwise, wonderfully faded.</p></div>"|14935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14935-death-seat/|7.4|Grayson Currin

The Brooklyn-by-way-of-New Orleans trio mixes a sort of jazzy folk with snatches of wildly disparate stuff like prog and slowcore, Eastern-flecked drone, gauzy 50s pop, turn-on-a-dime post-punk. It's stark in execution, dazzling in effect. Their songs jut out, double-back, criss-cross themselves, just about anything but what you'd expect them to do. Despite the warmth of guitarist Ryan Seaton's fingerwork and the awesome power of Sara Lucas' vocals, their elliptical unpredictability can make <i>Life of Love</i>, their latest, a bit like a problem to be worked out. But time spent untangling its knots proves unusually well-spent; you might not know it at first, but their sophomore set, <i>Life of Love</i>, proves another rich, rewarding listen from a quietly spectacular ensemble.</p>
<p>Lucas' voice, for good reason the centerpiece of every Callers song, is something to behold. She manages the seemingly impossible feat of sounding entirely different on every track, yet very much herself; smoky notes of Patti Smith and Sandy Denny linger, but she's deft and adaptable, never sounding enough like anybody to invite easy comparisons. Despite the gale force in her throat, Lucas evinces an incredible reserve, saving her big moment for when it really counts, offering subtler shades elsewhere. Ditto Ryan Seaton and newest member Don Godwin's accompaniment; Seaton's playing is smartly unflashy, allowing Lucas ample negative space, occasionally swelling in brilliant bursts of color. Godwin's presence does fill out Callers' sound some, but he hangs back, offering these divergent songs a steady underpinning that keeps even their fanciest flights grounded. They move confidently, nimbly through style after style, weaving in sounds without letting them stand in the way of their serpentine tunes. Recorded on borrowed equipment in fits and spurts over the last several years, <i>Life of Love </i>feels very much of a piece, and that's owed to the
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
band's deeply felt chemistry. That the three have known each other for some time, have relocated several times to keep the band intact, seems especially germane here; more than most, these people truly sound banded together.</p>
<p>Hard pressed to pick a highlight, I'll start where Callers did: The album's built around a cover of Wire's ""Heartbeat"" that also served as the band's first recording after their 2008 effort, <i>Fortune</i>. Though they maintain the song's thrusting rhythm and slightly queasy melody, Lucas' interpretation of the lyric-- more literal, less paranoid than Colin Newman's terse <i>Chairs Missing</i> take-- is argument enough for its inclusion in the jazz standards songbook. Yep, a Wire song. The title track does kind of a <i>Dusty in Memphis</i> meets <i>Veckatimest</i> thing, its chunkily precise arrangement underpinning Lucas' increasingly unconvincing-- if completely arresting-- assertion that she's ""gonna live a life of love."" Thematically, the album's nearly as slippery as its sonics, but Lucas is a seeker, and the yearn in her voice often says more than her words. This would seem to be Callers' stock and trade, making small gestures seem grand, letting a few notes feel like plenty, leaving you to fill in the rest.</p></div>"|14949.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14949-life-of-love/|7.6|Paul Thompson

And yet, now that the album in question, <i>Donnie G</i>,<i> </i>finally arrives it's as his debut on the iconic Def Jam label.</p>
<p><i>Donnie G </i>is a testament to Sheek's resiliency, but over those hard-fought years the rapper hasn't reinvented himself so much as recontextualized-- his emphatic starving-artist bark integrating the requisite hashtag and ad-libs of 2010 with fewer seams than you'd expect. It's allowed him to subsequently sound about right in the galaxy of Kay Slay rap: Ever-grinding NYC mixtape types like Maino, Uncle Murda, and Papoose, dudes whose beefs you can never keep straight, always seem on the verge of a major-label release that never happens, and are long on regional bluster and even longer on face-palm punchlines. Sheek honors the PE-sampling intro ""Rhyme Animal"" by calling himself ""rap's herpes"" with no irony whatsoever (whether ""you don't want to see me"" is a justifiable explanation is up for debate) and then obviously rhyming that with Slurpees and Hercules. Later on, he claims to ""lyrically ejaculate,"" but that's not quite as embarrassing as saying, ""Don Don about to blow up-- grenade!"" And y'all thought he was going to say ""World Trade.""</p>
<p>Unlike Jada, Sheek doesn't bog down <i>Donnie G </i>with ill-fated pop moves, and there isn't the unrelenting grimness of Styles' solo work. As the very rare rapper who brags about how good is he at lifting weights as moving it, <i>Donnie G </i>is at its best when ""bottle service"" means Vitamin Water instead of Nuvo. Statik Selektah's beat on ""Nite Falls"" somehow has sci-fi proggers Planet P Project soundtracking a club riot, and while ""Clip Up (Reloaded)"" and the Black Uhuru-sampling ""Dinner Guest"" aspires to be something of low-budget ""POWER"", it's a reminder of the LOX's potency when they attack a track as a posse cut rather than a concession to Hot 97. Obviously, the attempt at Drake-like pop-rap with DJ Webstar (you know, the ""Chicken Noodle Soup"" dude) doesn't sound like it has much investment from anyone involved; a smooth Jeremih hook makes ""Party After 2"" Sheek's best seduction of both females and radio play.</p>
<p>On ""Dinner Guest"", you finally get some insight into the life of someone who often goes out of his way to portray himself simply as a blank Consummate Thug: While looking back on his decade and a half career, he raps, ""Did deals with everybody, even survived the Puff rape,"" and yet earlier, he boasts that he's ""trying to be like Diddy, put some women in the tub (take that!)."" This isn't new: there've been plenty of references to getting his ""Benjamins"" money back throughout the past few years, but what's weirder is that he's slyly complementary of Diddy as well-- <i>Donnie G </i>is damn near a long-form commercial for Ciroc, and the LOX even reconsidered signing with the guy again. That really goes to the heart of the however-limited appeal of <i>Donnie G</i>: For years, the LOX have been seen as emblematic industry victims, but at his best, Sheek eschews that and realizes the paradoxical ability to sound like a beast and an underdog at the same time.</p></div>"|14945.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14945-donnie-g-don-gorilla/|5.3|Ian Cohen

Though we got some undeniably great music in the process, it felt somewhat ancillary to ""Tush"", ""Back Like That"", the ""Back Like That"" remix, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/7712-ghostface-killah/"" target=""_blank"">bummed out interviews</a>, and hiring Diddy's production team for <i>Big Doe Rehab--</i> all pretty clear actions of someone who takes his poor commercial fortunes very personally and isn't trying to be anyone's idea of a cult act. Of course, none of it worked in the slightest, so even if it was a giant fuck-you to his hardcore contingent, <i>Ghostdini </i>was at least understandable as the culmination of years worth of frustration from someone who felt like he ran out of crossover options. Or, as Ghostface said in <i>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx</i>, ""I'm hanging this shit up if this shit don't work.""</p>
<p>On its face, <i>Apollo Kids </i>is a weirdly deflated concession from both parties: Twelve spartanly named tracks, barely over 40 minutes of music, a ton of guests hailing from Ghost's inner circle, a rehashed album title, and a near total lack of promotion: If Ghostface didn't have a Twitter account, there's a good chance we wouldn't be aware of this thing's existence. But isn't that what we were all clamoring for after the desperate shilling of <i>Ghostdini</i>? At the outset, it would sure seem so. <i>Apollo Kids</i> plays out something like a lower-stakes version of <i>The Pretty Toney Album</i>, no RZA but plenty of that record's time-honored breakbeats, blaxploitatied guitars, and swallowed-whole soul samples.</p>
<p>It's the kind of stuff that his harried intensity always sounds viscerally powerful over, even if the rhymes aren't prime material. He doesn't throw his darts sideways anymore, but without sort of bullshit clutter, he's still an incredibly ostentatious lyricist, just one that's easier to parse. The record's opening trio is evidence enough of that: on ""Purified Thoughts"", Killah Priest and GZA add their typical ballast-heavy musings on metaphysics and crack sales to Ghost's boasting of feeding children in Benin and ""Africans chantin' me on like Coachella."" When matched up with a more comparable style, Busta Rhymes helps turn ""Superstar"" into an Olympic-level track meet of fast-rap, while Ghost and Cappadonna appropriately spaz out for ""Black Tequila"". And while ""Handcuffin' Them Hoes [ft. Jim Jones]""Â is possibly the least promising run of words ever to grace a Ghostface tracklist, there's still an illicit glee in how lines like, ""And I ain't even gotta be dipped/ I pull out my pocket two sloppy joe mitts this thick!"" counter the problem that some of his most locked-in performances as of late come at the expense of tactful gender relations.</p>
<p>While the music and the personnel are all comfort food for Ghostface, <i>Apollo Kids </i>still leaves something of a strange aftertaste. The basically arbitrary sequencing never allows too much momentum to build, and the lack of any sort of organizational principle makes it come off seeming more slapped-together by Def Jam interns than an Event release befitting Ghost's rep. But the larger issue is that <i>Apollo Kids </i>feels like a record that's good because it never dares to be great. Even on Ghostface's more uneven LPs, there are always reasons to think of Ghostface as a victim of his own prolificacy rather than someone who can no longer make a legit claim as one of the greatest rappers ever-- ""Alex (Stolen Script)"", ""Maxine"", ""White Linen Affair"", to name a few. That ""2getha Baby"" and ""How You Like Me Baby"" didn't spark much buzz in advance shouldn't be a surprise, as they feature the kind of clock-punching rhymes (""She look like she get it from her mama/ That's right Michelle I'm Obama"") that Ghostface is supposed to be an alternative to. Those are two of the three songs on <i>Apollo Kids </i>that are solo joints (the other being ""Starkology"", which is so minimal it's barely there), and the most troubling aspect is that <i>Apollo Kids </i>makes a strong claim as Ghost's best LP since <i>Fishscale</i>,Â and he's hardly on it.</p>
<p>You'll never have to question whether foot soldiers like Shawn Wiggs, Trife Da God, and Sheek Louch are going to try and bring whatever constitutes their A-games, but Ghostface should never get outshined by the likes of Joell Ortiz when it comes to criminology. ""In Tha Park"" also is somewhat underwhelming for a song that features two of the best voices in hip-hop on the same track for the first time; yet whereas Black Thought's invocation of fights at the Spectrum and out-of-town ice skaters feels steeped in personal history, Ghost's hip-hop origin story comes off like he's told it dozens of times.</p>
<p>It's hard not to feel conflicted about <i>Apollo Kids</i>. Unlike Ghostface records that presumably get unfairly judged by the standards of his best work, it's tempting to overrate it due a general relief that he didn't try to make <i>Ghostdini </i>again. And even if the initial buzz of simply getting a new LP wears off pretty quickly here, it's not to the point where ""no Ghostface"" is better than ""new Ghostface."" But as with the aforementioned Weezer, Ghostface's weakest output is coming at a point when he's releasing more than ever, and differentiating correlation and causation just gets harder and harder: I realize the days of spiced-out Calvin Coolers are long gone, but it's also been enough time since the relatively earthbound <i>Fishscale </i>that I'm not certain the remedy is just slowing the fuck down.</p></div>"|14942.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14942-apollo-kids/|7.3|Ian Cohen

He does this both personally (shuttering his dubstep-affiliated Skull Disco label, moving to Berlin) and artistically (his intricate, pattering rhythms can take months to program).Â <i>Fabric 55</i> is one step further into the dance world, expanding on the stolid gray sonics of 2009'sÂ <i>Three EP</i>'s for a nightclub/label at the center of the techno community.  But <i>Fabric 55</i>-- a studio-reproduced mix of Shackleton's set at the club featuring plenty of new material-- doesn't see Shackleton cast his hat into the ring of prominent DJs so much as affirm his status as an inspired squatter of whatever scene he inhabits.</p>
<p>In his review of the first Skull Disco compilation, Tim Finney said ""Shackleton's production can seem like statues... waiting for someone to enliven and animate them.""  On <i>Fabric 55</i>, Shackleton plays the animator himself, carefully stitching together his own already careful work.  Like Fabric DJs Omar S and Ricardo Villalobos before him, Shackleton mixes exclusively his own material.  He doesn't necessarily shed new light on his work, but the shorter, more transitory nature of the tracks here releases them-- Shackelton himself enlivens and animates his own productions.</p>
<p>Shackleton all but abandons his Skull Disco tracks, cutting his already tenuous ties to dubstep.  Instead he focuses on bizarro earworms (""Negative Thoughts"") and still more Middle Eastern vocal samples.  Strung together they reveal an alien noir, one whose sound-world is complete enough to divorce you from the feeling of listening to techno.  In a home-listening context, it's often easier to file him alongside Coil and your Edward Gorey prints as Michael Mayer or Skream.  If Shackleton's rhythms previously served primarily to hollow your mind in order to better contemplate Deep Dark Thoughts (see: ""Death Is Not Final"", ""I Am Animal"", etc.), they now highlight his idiosyncrasies, the tilted drum timbres and haunting vocal melodies he seems completely subservient to.</p>
<p>Shackleton's craftsmanship lends his work a resilient delicacy.  His idea of a big build-and-release DJ moment appears to be to ratchet the tension up one half-notch and then sneakily ratchet it back down, before anyone gets too excited.  The two-part ""Man on a String"" suite features furious, jazzy hand drums and a tip-toeing synth line in what amounts to an explosion of activity.  Shackleton has always been kin to minimal techno producers, but <i>Fabric 55</i> isn't spare so much as careful and modest.</p>
<p><i>Fabric 55</i> is world music in the most literal sense: It is a Londoner living in Berlin composing dance music with African rhythms, reggae melodies, and Far Eastern vocals.  Shackleton does this using a computer, and he does it not to educate or out of deep respect for these cultures and traditions; he does it because these are some sounds he's heard and <a href=""http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature.aspx?1263"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he likes them better than other sounds</a>.  I think this augurs well for Shackleton's future, even if <i>Fabric 55</i> sounds like a weird purgatory between the vitality of his early singles and his next true breakthrough or change-up.  This mix lingers and waits; it stirs and then settles again.  Rather than a career retrospective or a greatest hits package, <i>Fabric 55</i> is a thoughtful moment in a singular producer's trajectory.</p></div>"|14947.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14947-fabric-55/|7.7|Andrew Gaerig

However, I'm probably not alone, as Forrest presumably tongue-bathed many a supporter in the mid-aughts while touring on the back of his two wonderfully spastic full-lengths, <i>The Unrelenting Songs of the 1979 Post-Disco Crash</i> and <i>Shamelessly Exciting</i>. At the time, laptop artists warranted notice for out-performing a statue on stage, but Forrest's sugar-rush antics raised the bar for point-and-clickers everywhere, showing that it was possible to create a party atmosphere around a guy playing air guitar to his laptop.</p>
<p>Of course, in the four years since Forrest last released music under his own name, laptop dance parties have become a common sight, with Girl Talk the scene's reigning superstar. Forrest meanwhile hid behind his cheeky breakcore/remixer pseudonym DJ Donna Summer, concentrated on curating his labels, Cock Rock Disco and Nightshifters, and invented an iPhone sampler app. But with the quiet Soundcloud release of this EP and big plans for 2011, Forrest seems poised to reclaim his rightful place in the world of sample abuse.</p>
<p>Put mash-up artists on alert-- where Girl Talk and compadres are content to punch the nostalgia button dead center, Forrest prefers to nibble around the edges with his copyright infringement. Consider ""My 36 Favorite Punk Songs"" from <i>Shamelessly Exciting</i>, which is exactly what it says, but dices each sample down to almost-subliminal length, weaving out of those microfibers new material that is simultaneously punk and punk's mortal enemy, prog. The final product is better than fair use; it's novel use.</p>
<p>But the DJ Donna Summer experiments may have siphoned off some of Forrest's party-rock playfulness, as <i>Utopia</i> suggests his frenetic style has been infected with something resembling maturity. Recognizable samples and skittering drumbeats-- two hallmarks of Forrest's usual style-- are scarce, and the tone of the record's brief 13 minutes is less a danceable prank than a cinematic short. Opener ""Ciccone Youth"" (named for Sonic Youth's classic piece of lawyer chum) is even downright doomy, slowly fading in on anxious backwards strings and ominous buzzings before dropping in martial drumming, simulated heavy breathing, and modem bleeps.</p>
<p>The title track contains Forrest's most familiar rhythmic stutter-step, if sparser than usual, but it's over in less than a minute, bleeding back into another chilling soundscape: ""Infinite Organ"", haunted by guitar drones and horror-flick piano. Only the closing ""Goldbluff"" satisfies one's classic Jason Forrest craving, combining classic rock carpet swatches-- a bit of Garth Hudson organ here, some Chicago Transit Authority horn stabs there-- and crafting a piece of violet, head-bobbing psychedelia that survives a late-term disintegration into bit-core.</p>
<p>But just like that, the enticing glimpse of Forrest's old tricks is over, decaying to field recordings of slot machines. EPs are funny things; some are previews, some are diversions. If <i>Utopia</i> is a teaser of Jason Forrest's post-metamorphosis state, he's leaving behind the face-licking, yielding the floor to the mash-up mashers, and moving into more ponderous territory. But given Forrest's prankster past, I wouldn't bet on it.</p></div>"|14948.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14948-utopia-ep/|6.5|Rob Mitchum

This later transpired to be a joke started by band member Sam Franklin-- also of Ridgewood's Fluffy Lumbers and Ducktails.  The statement poked fun at the increasingly common dramas of so-serious touring bands, and although November was a little late for an April Fools gag, Big Troubles do things on their own time.</p>
<p>The band initially comes across as a retro act. They open their debut album, <i>Worry</i>, with ""Video Rock"", pitching them right back into the early 1990s with the VHS name drop and the four-track recorded guitars on maximum gain. The blown-speakers lo-fi sound gives them an attention-grabbing aesthetic and pulls them close to their forebears, lending the guitars an intensity and warmth that recalls shoegaze's noisiest moments. The most obvious nod to the original dream poppers comes with the drum stutter that ushers in ""Video Rock"", tipping its hat to the first few seconds of Loveless.</p>
<p>Despite this, Big Troubles shouldn't be slotted into the same bracket as the numerous My Bloody Valentine imitators. For one, they seem more intent on sculpting would-be anthems than soundscapes-- most of the songs run under three minutes, and outer-space closer ""Astrology Screen Savers"" seems epic at almost four. Debut single ""Freudian Slips"" covers itself in glory, with a churning beat and huge guitar riff and vocals that slip just beneath its rough surface. While the ragged sound is more crumpled bubblegum wrapper than pop, it doesn't disguise the promise at work. ""Bite Yr Tongue"" is similarly irresistible, with a crooning vocal carried along by fuzzy guitars that add a layer of static that threatens to detune the entire picture.</p>
<p>At first, it's exciting to chase the melodies through all the noisy wormholes, but this ultimately becomes an exhausting pursuit. The brash production tends to keep the album sounding one-dimensional, and what makes the record so alluring at first becomes a honey trap. In less gritty surroundings, the songwriting might shine even brighter, and this nagging frustration isn't helped by frontloaded sequencing that builds a heady momentum only for the record to fall beneath its own weight as it drags in the second half.</p>
<p>The front cover of <i>Worry</i> shows an assortment of dilapidated furniture and electronics, and Big Troubles take care to give off the same detached vibes, from the fake band break-ups to the beyond-the-red guitars.

Their name is a nod to Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky's classic 1972 film, <i>Solaris</i>, about a psychologist who is haunted by what he perceives to be his dead wife aboard a space station. And while it's easy to call up images of oceanic planets while listening to the duo's debut LP,Â <i>She Was Coloured In</i>, conjuring the emotionally complex and ruminative themes at work in a film like <i>Solaris</i> is much more difficult. Solar Bears instead seem to take their inspiration from less sophisticated fare, as much of <i>She Was Coloured In</i> feels like the soundtrack to a cheesy, choose-your-own-ending sci-fi novel you might pick up at a yard sale. But this is no slight, despite a proclivity for epic synth lines and rhythm-driven tracks built for B-movie chase sequences. Solar Bears are able to cleverly balance their nerdier impulses by taking cues from Air's most amorous leanings and shading their music with the dark electronics that mark contemporaries like Matthew Dear and CFCF.</p>
<p>On one end of the spectrum are songs like ""Head Supernova"" and ""The Quiet Planet"", which sound like what people in the 1950s must have assumed the music of 2011 would be like, while ""Solarization"" could have easily stood in as an early ""Nova"" theme song. These cosmically fanciful tracks sometimes threaten to overwhelm the more restrained moments, especially considering the record's clumsy sequencing. But as producers continue to warm to the idea of integrating unhip, dated 80s motifs into their music, it seems frivolous to scold Solar Bears for pushing it a little.</p>
<p>Having a strongly defined sound doesn't mean you aren't allowed to play around, and Solar Bears make the most of these excursions. ""Cub"" features a chilly acoustic guitar at its center, overlapped by a soft, woodwind-like swell. ""Primary Colours at the Back of My Mind"" mirrors Air's ""Playground Love"" so closely it almost borders on plagiarism, all hazed-out on 70s FM slow-burn sexy. But the finishing touches-- melting orchestral flourishes, wah-wah'd porno guitar, some perfectly plain drums-- all showcase Solar Bears' ability to get the details right.</p>
<p>So the very best stuff on <i>She Was Coloured In</i> manages to touch all the bases, using the low-key moments for atmosphere and juicing them up with stylish genre tweaks. ""She Was Coloured In"" pulses with a progged-out, psychedelic energy, while ""Crystalline (Be Again)"" is a delicate club jam that oozes late-era New Order. Highlight ""Dolls"" ambitiously drags bleary, wistful keys and strings through an epically aggressive trip-hop suite, followed by an anthemic final act. In these moments, <i>She Was Coloured</i> really pops; the mysteries of the universe as imagined in a pulp novel seem to come into focus.</p></div>"|14944.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14944-she-was-coloured-in/|6.9|Zach Kelly

It's a score for a Disney franchise  film that cost an estimated $200 million to make. As such, there are  lots of classical-inspired strings and horns played by an 85-strong  orchestra. Most of the soundtrack's 22 pieces don't last more than three  minutes; only a few could be considered actual songs. And while we knew  this was going to be a score since it was first reported nearly two  years ago, it's tough to shake the gloom of blown expectations while  listening to the same ominous theme as it repeats in slightly  mutated forms across the hour-long soundtrack. The French duo's current  move is almost undeniably disappointing, but it's also not a surprise.</p>
<p>Daft Punk aren't the same two guys who made <i>Homework</i> and <i>Discovery</i>. Over the course of the last decade, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter have increasingly relied on images to complement-- and sometimes justify-- their music. Since their last proper LP, 2005's <i>Human After All</i>,  the pair staged the greatest dance music tour of all time-- one that  blasted its audience with enough visual stimuli to leave them blinking  stars for hours. The pyramid, the gleaming helmets, and the lite-bright  leather jackets brought Daft Punk's greatest hits to a holy,  undiscovered realm. Their 2006 art-house indulgence <i>Electroma</i> went even further as it was directed by the twosome yet  featured no new music. Daft Punk haven't even attempted a can't-miss  song in at least five years, and the <i>Tron: Legacy</i> soundtrack keeps that unfortunate streak alive.</p>
<p>The score keeps another trend going, too. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo have flexed their robot obsession for years, but its nature has changed. On <i>Discovery</i> tracks like ""Digital Love"", ""Something About Us"", and ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"", they employed robotic voice effects to bring out the  childlike naÃ¯vetÃ©Â of artificial intelligence. And <i>Discovery</i>'s accompanying animated movie, <i>Interstella 5555</i>,  was a bright and fun technicolor cartoon. But their mechanized  fantasies have gotten continually darker since then-- consider the much  more sinister robo effects on <i>Human After All</i>'s ""The Brainwasher"" and ""Television Rules the Nation"". <i>Electroma</i>'s two metal-machine leads commit harrowing self-destruct suicides. Most of the robot doomsaying  can't compare with their ebullient side; their apocalyptic visions are  hardly Philip K. Dick-worthy, and they're oftentimes a huge bummer to  boot.</p>
<p><i>Tron: Legacy</i> is rated PG and aimed at igniting the imaginations of 10-year-old boys. When I watched it in IMAX 3D  it was easy to revert back to my younger self and just gawk at the  exquisite whiz-bang of it all. That said, it's pretty fucking dark. Most  of the movie takes place in a virtual world that doesn't know  sunlight-- it's like a futuristic version of Tolkien's Mordor. Almost all of the post-Han Solo humor that buoyed the original <i>Tron</i> is replaced by a thunderous seriousness (and blue-black color scheme) more akin to <i>The Dark Knight</i>. And the music follows suit with endless crescendos of pounding timpani drums and monolithic strings. Naturally, the music synchs  a hell of a lot better when you're watching the stunning images it was  made to accompany. Daft Punk's score plays a vital role in making this  poorly scripted mega movie seem bigger and more important than it  actually is.</p>
<p>Even so, it hems frustratingly close to the sweeping classical film music style pioneered by John Williams (<i>Star Wars</i>) and picked up by Howard Shore (<i>The Lord of the Rings</i>) and Hans Zimmer (<i>The Dark Knight</i>). The <i>Tron: Legacy</i> score's supposed innovation is combining an orchestra style with  electronics, but the meshing of the two styles is rare and rudimentary.  More often than not, each piece is either mostly synth-based (including filter-house also-rans ""Derezzed"" and ""Tron Legacy (End Titles)"") or symphonic (""Nocturne"", ""Outlands""). When they pull off the combo-- as on the blistering ""The Game Has Changed""-- it's thrilling even without an IMAX  screen hijacking your senses. And while the classical arrangements mark  a new style for Daft Punk, it's hardly revelatory in the sphere of  movie scores at large.</p>
<p>Watching the movie, I couldn't help but  think that this was Daft Punk's attempt at topping their legendary  pyramid tour. Theoretically, by teaming up with Disney and the most  high-tech cameras and surround-sound systems and recording facilities  known to man, the two could could dive bomb into the minds of millions  of people in one immense opening weekend <i>and</i> stay consistent with their  man vs. machine ideology-- all without leaving the comfort of their own  homes. But the tour was phenomenal because they were the central  characters-- not just a side act-- and because it was delusionally fun. <i>Tron: Legacy</i> has flashes of that sort of brilliance, but it's downright puny compared  to the sheer joy that is ""One More Time"" or ""Around the World"". Daft  Punk used to be a couple of guys hellbent on making genius dance music who  happened to wear goofy robot helmets. Along the way, though, their  priorities seem to have changed.</p></div>"|14938.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14938-tron-legacy-ost/|5.5|Ryan Dombal

That he made his album stand out amidst a formidable number of similar acts was a testament to how well he could extract one recognizable cell from the past and spawn it into something wholly his own, reverential but hardly derivative.</p>
<p><i>Golden Haze </i>initially appears to be the culmination of Wild Nothing's big year, collecting the previously available <i>Evertide EP</i>, aÂ <i>Gemini</i> B-side, and two new tracks. But as a State of Wild Nothing Report, it shows that Tatum is nowhere near done messing with his favorite musical ingredients. While still enamored with 1980s UK indie, like so much of <i>Gemini</i>, the maneuvering here sneaks up on you. The sunny jungle of ""Summer Holiday"" is almost completely forgone for something sleeker and darker, more along the lines of <i>Gemini</i> standouts ""Chinatown"" or ""Bored Games"".</p>
<p>It's a good look for him, considering Tatum's knack for succinct romantic pleas (""beautiful one, I want to go where you are"") and weaving chains of floral guitar notes, both of which propel the gorgeous title track. It's one of Wild Nothing's strongest singles, but it's also where he starts to tweak the arrangements, particularly with drums. The textural mesh of its severely-gated snare and sleigh bells recalls the Cure's ""Just Like Heaven"", and Tatum's portentous and maudlin vocal range invites further comparisons to Robert Smith.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the one selection from <i>Golden Haze </i>EP that would've been the most jarring inclusion on <i>Gemini </i>is actually a B-side from ""Summer Holiday""-- ""Vultures Like Lovers"" is pure, ecstatic texture, a heavily processed guitar ping-ponging with delay, and Tatum's tremolo'd vocals building a cyclone from the ground up. It's the sort of experiment that ends up as a B-side for a reason, but its inclusion is evidence of what I find most charming about Wild Nothing: The combination of decades-old influence with the ability to see a modern prolific talent progress almost in real time.</p></div>"|14937.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14937-golden-haze-ep/|7.7|Ian Cohen

Its cover was going to feature T.I., in front of a stark white background, sunk deep into a wicker throne, a lion standing by his side. <i>King Uncaged</i>, an album we'llÂ nowÂ presumably never hear, was to be Tip's first after he completed almost a year in prison, finishing up a gun sentence that could've sent him away for a whole lot longer. This was supposed to be the final triumphant chapter in Tip's redemption story, and everybody loves shit like that. Instead, life intervened. A Los Angeles traffic stop led to a drug arrest and a parole violation, and now T.I. is headed right back to prison for another 11 months. So<i> No Mercy</i> is a confused muddle, some of the material presumably recorded before the arrest and some of it after. It's called <i>No Mercy </i>presumably because <i>King Recaged </i>wasn't catchy enough, and the album cover seems to be T.I. either wiping away a tear or punching himself in the face. Given how the album turned out, the face-punch is exactly the right gesture.</p>
<p>T.I. sounds best when he's in dominant form, tossing punchlines at inferior rappers from a great height. His best tracks come with a sense of inevitability; you know, from the first moment you hear them, that they're going to boom out of passing cars for months to come. ""What You Know"" worked like that. ""Rubber Band Man"" worked like that. Even ""Whatever You Like"" worked like that. Absolutely nothing on <i>No Mercy</i> works like that. Simply put, introspection does not work for T.I. At this point, he has nothing thought-provoking left to say about his gun arrest or its aftermath, and it's no fun whatsoever to hear him say ""I'm only human"" or ""Apologies to the fans"" for the millionth time. But <i>No Mercy </i>is his third straight album of halfassed introspection. The things that were boring or simplistic about his forced humility have only gotten worse. On <i>No Mercy</i>, he sounds absolutely sapped of energy. And that's rough; nobody plays the ferocious livewire better.</p>
<p>The last time Tip made an album like this, he was just about to head off to prison, and he scored the biggest hit of his career with the maudlin but catchy ""Live Your Life"". Here, he tries to repeat that success, roping in a wide and dazzling cast of collaborators to chase a commercial hit that he sounds too depleted to actually score. <i>No Mercy</i>, I'm almost positive, is the first album to feature contributions from both Swedish pop mastermind Max Martin and Houston rap O.G. Scarface. The assembled list of guests and contributors is just nuts: Kanye West, Eminem, Drake, Christina Aguilera, Dr. Luke, the Neptunes. But too often, this amazing assemblage of talents seems to want to make introspective Flo Rida tracks-- and, worse, they fail at it. ""Big Picture"" has an emaciated synth-rap track so tinny that I can barely believe DJ Toomp produced it. The-Dream has never sounded more like Chester Bennington than he does on the ill-advised crunch-rock title track. And album closer ""Castle Walls"" is downright insulting-- Tip wallowing in his rich-guy sorrows as a wave of gloopy Europop keyboard washes over him. ""Everyone thinks I have it all, but it's so empty living behind these castle walls,"" Christina Aguilera sings on the hook. Yeah, that must be really tough. My sympathies, rich people.</p>
<p>Throughout <i>No Mercy</i>, Tip remains an absolutely impeccable rapper, delivering even his lamest pieces of self-help nothingness in masterful clumps of singsong cadence and slurry double-time bounce. I get the impression that he could still absolutely rip a track to shreds if he could only get himself excited about the prospect. And every so often, <i>No Mercy</i> crackles to life, and we hear flashes of the rap hero Tip could still be. ""Amazing"", for instance, finds the Neptunes taking it back to 2002, delivering the sort of chilly minimalist computer-funk that they <i>never</i> make anymore, and Tip just dives into those chasms of empty space with the assurance of an old pro (Pharrell gets the best punchline, though: ""That dark blue shit? Y'all niggas been had/ My diamonds rainbowed like they registered for GLAAD.""). And ""I Can't Help It"" is a blaring, menacing gangsta-rap crawl that gives Tip a chance to just attack in a way he rarely lets himself anymore. But a quick guest appearance on ""Strip"" highlights everything that's wrong with even the album's best moments. T.I.'s exuberant protege Young Dro careens onto the track with the sort of joyous virtuosity that T.I. used to display. Maybe he'll show it again. Not for at least another 11 months, though.</p></div>"|14923.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14923-no-mercy/|5.5|Tom Breihan

One way to read it is that they're <i>all</i> stars-- corny, I know, but the label's releases have been noticeably consistent (or at least consistently interesting) since they started coming out in January, demonstrating a cross-section of UK dance music whose influences are all over the map: southern U.S. rap, London grime, a little bit of dubstep, Detroit techno, DÃ¢m-Funk-style electro-funk, etc. Throwing proper nouns at this music is fun for genre wonks, but the reality is that the comp works well because it makes all that variety explicit.</p>
<p>Still, the marks that unify <i>Night Slugs</i> are as obvious to my ears as the ones that vary it. Most of the label's productions are colorful and brash, working not only through layers of sound but head-on collisions of them. If the music were generally less imaginative than it is, I'd say that the urgency and pride with which it all foregrounds its glitz borders on tasteless, but Night Slugs know to whom they're appealing, and it's not the folks thoughtfully nodding their heads in the corner. Some of the synths here are noxious enough to peel paint from the walls, and though the futurist crunk of Girl Unit's ""Wut"" is the only song to feature an actual airhorn, airhorns are implied throughout. There is exactly one track that could probably be described as ""laid-back"" here-- Jacques Greene's ""(Baby I Don't Know) What You Want""-- and its runner-up is called ""Booty Slammer"".</p>
<p>Night Slugs' record covers-- all designed by co-founder and label contributor Bok Bok-- are always combinations of black and one or two other colors, presented in various shades. Usually, the image is geometric and semi-architectural (a suspension bridge and car; glowing pistons spelling out words), but presented ag
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
ainst a completely black background in a way that makes them look iconic, like they're without space or landscape. I mention them because they're a strong analogue for the label's musical style: Not only do the bright colors sing in the darkness, but they're given a proper spectrum. In the same way the tracks remind me that there's a lot of range to be extracted from the seemingly monotonous blast of a rave synth, the covers remind me that hot pink can get as close to purple as it can to white-- range in places you might expect to be limited. Listen to this comp more than a few times and you'll probably start to hear chasms between stuff like Bok Bok &amp; Cubic Zirconia's ""Reclash (Dub)"" and Girl Unit's ever-luxurious ""Wut"". The palettes are similar, but the ends to which they're used-- and the moods they evoke-- are different.</p>
<p>People who've followed the label since its inception-- and before that, when it was just a club night-- will diddle around with arguments about what should or shouldn't've made it onto this comp. Those arguments can be fun, like: Two tracks from Lil Silva seems more generous toward Lil Silva than to us as listeners; ""She Wore Velour"" is a more obvious choice for Velour than ""Booty Slammer""; and ""Bust Broke"" as a choice for Kingdom feels willfully evasive when we have ""Fogs"", but they're both good. On the other hand, Bok Bok gives Girl Unit's ""IRL"" a remix, and Jam City's ""Arpjam""-- one of the comp's new tracks-- indicates that regardless of whether Night Slugs are ready to put out <i>Volume 2</i> by 2012, they're not slowing down just yet.</p></div>"|14927.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14927-night-slugs-allstars-volume-1/|8.1|Mike Powell

Between them, stripped-down R&amp;B and arty, slurry, ritualistic avant-pop privilegeÂ a similar kind of guilelessness. Both modes do impressionism well, and both have no problem letting vocals veer into the moans and murmurs one might hear at a sÃ©ance. Differences abound, of course, but so do signs of fruitful communion-- among them Autre Ne Veut. A one-man act from New York (he prefers to keep his identity secret), Autre Ne Veut shares qualities and a scene with acts like How to Dress Well, Games, and, less directly, soul-aspiring indie bands from Bon Iver to Yeasayer. But Autre Ne Veut has something special. For one thing, every song on his self-titled debut is a marvel, each in its own way. For another, the way he steers his voice toward the eccentricities and extremes of R&amp;B sounds disarmingly logical, natural, and heartfelt.</p>
<p>To speak of R&amp;B in this context might just be another way of saying, ""He really sings-- like, he really <i>leans into</i> it."" But it's less his voice than his way with hooks and trills and melody that signals Autre Ne Veut as someone who could transcend the arty underground (if he wanted to, which he may well not). Wherever they find a context, the songs on <i>Autre Ne Veut</i> are packed, concise, abstract pop dynamos. The disarming album opener ""Tell Me"" spins like a pop song in a centrifuge, with Autre Ne Veut singing against himself in overdubbed layers over a backing track that manages to cast harsh, disorienting electronic smears in a comely melodic role. It's seriously out-there stuff, but also, oddly, possessed of a directness and clarity that could work just as well on a lost album by someone like Billy Ocean.</p>
<p>There's also a sort of bravery at play in some of Autre Ne Veut's more unflinching moves. In ""O.M.G."", he lays down his guard with lyrcs directed to a prospective paramour-- ""Oh my god, I can feel it in my body,"" and, ""Everyone says it's the perfect night""-- that are sung as if by someone half-remembering an older cousin's tales of what 1980s pop radio sounded like. But then the song snakes around and finds Autre Ne Veut hesitant to do the deed-- filled with neuroses and empathy for someone he'd rather not hurt, even if by chance. ""I don't want to be your heartbreak,"" he sings. ""I don't want to be the one to make you want to have to work.""</p>
<p>""Wake Up"" is comparatively spare, with Autre Ne Veut urging himself to get out of a relationship in a severe falsetto. Parts of his vocals peal into a sort of demonic mode (like Avey Tare when he pushes past his range), and the subtle, spacious track behind him is rendered by cheap digital gear. But again, there's no overstating how also sturdy and strong it is as a certifiable ""pop"" song in the end. The same goes even more for songs that totally go for it, too. Over a hooky strobe effect and some chintzy, chancy chimes that give everything a sense of grandeur, ""Drama Cum Drama"" lays out a store of great melodic vocal ideas that Autre Ne Veut files through with seemingly very little effort or deliberation. He does the same on other highlights like ""Two Days of Rain"", ""New Depth"", and ""Soldier"". The way really gifted guitarists or keyboardists might attach little arpeggios or counterpoint lines to a melody while just fiddling around? Autre Ne Veut does that with his voice. He jams.</p></div>"|14925.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14925-autre-ne-veut/|8.1|Andy Battaglia

""It was over a long time ago! It's over, okay? Go home! Your cage is clean."" The screen goes black just as Black Flag's ""Nervous Breakdown"" starts up; the vocal is by Keith Morris, Black Flag co-founder and Schloss' longtime boss in the Circle Jerks. It's a funny juxtaposition, considering the recent history of the Circle Jerks; though Morris attempted to keep the Jerks' engine running after yet another failed go, he and Burning Brides frontman Dimitri Coats teamed up, called a couple of buddies, ground out 16 songs. The results would stopÂ in their tracksÂ anybody who'd dare declare punk rock dead. Morris was around for the birth of hardcore, and from the sound of his new band OFF!, they're going to have to drag him away from the stuff, screaming.</p>
<p>For OFF!, Morris and Coats rang up bassist Steven McDonald of the perennially underrated Redd Kross, and Rocket From the Crypt/Earthless drummer Mario ""Ruby Mars"" Rubalcaba. Coats may be OFF!'s least known quantity, but here, as with the stoner rock of his Brides, he's got an adaptable style and ear for detail that are perfect for this recapturing job. McDonald holds down the low end with an uncharacteristic simplicity that suits these airtight tracks to a T. And Ruby Mars couldn't have been a tough call, hell of a drummer that he is; you'd have to be to hold these songs together. These guys might be punks, but after years in the game, they're total pros. And all that backstory melts away in three seconds on this bruiser of a record, one that reignites the hardcore spirit and turn-on-a-dime intensity of Morris' work with Black Flag and early Circle Jerks years without ever coming off like a history lesson.</p>
<p>OFF! is Morris' show, and for all their help getting him back to his roots, the band keeps out of his way, firing off blistering, not-a-second-too-long rumbles that feel shot out of a cannon. But having some new blood in the room lights a raging fire under Morris, and he pounces on these tracks. As ever, he speak-shouts with an unusual clarity, even when he's spraying out a ton of words at once. But it's the adaptability of his voice that's most stunning, the way he'll start out spitting and then swoop down into a scream. Lyrically, the OFF! songs seem to play on Morris' role as an angry young man all grown up; a line like ""you wonder why I'm always screaming?"" would sound fine coming from some 17-year-old with a glue-stuck mohawk, but given Morris' elder statespunk position, the question deepens, the emphasis falls on the ""always."" The young dude declaring ""I've Had It"" three decades back still shouts ""Fuck People"" with equal fervor.</p>
<p><i>First Four EPs</i> crams 16 tracks into just over 17 minutes; the thing's packed so tightly, an extra second here or there could feel like one too many. This is lean, propulsive hardcore, played just as it would've been in L.A. circa 1981. The live-in-a-room recording lets you all but hear the sweat drip on the mic, Morris' hair slapping into Coats' amp. The breathless intensity of Morris' vocals is matched by the one-and-done feel of the musicianship; as Coats told Pitchfork last month, ""the demo is the record,"" and no decision's been overthought. Morris spent a decade and a half trying to get the Circle Jerks together enough to make another album, and this thing sounds like it was made in two days, almost for the hell of it, and those lowered stakes result in a ramped-up fervor.</p>
<p>Even with the short runtime, <i>First Four EPs</i> really takes it out of you; each EP takes you through highs and lows in quick succession, so hearing all four straight through is like being put through a tenderizer. For all their ripchord intensity, I wish they'd made just a little more room for McDonald, whose work with Redd Kross proved him more adept at sneaking intricate bass lines under hardcore rhythms than he's allowed here. But these are, after all, the <i>first</i> four EPs, which assumes there's more to come. You could argue that there's a nasty conservative streak running through these four EPs, that Morris already made better versions of this record with his previous bands. But OFF! feels less like a regression than a regrouping, a shoring up of old strengths with the hopes of recapturing an old feeling. And that much they nail.</p>
<p>In an indie rock landscape that typically values complex  arrangements, subtlety, and good taste, OFF! are not just refreshing, but  totally necessary. It's an economic shithole out there right now-- the  same conditions that led to hardcore in the first place. This music is built  for a climate of frustration and powerlessness, and its bare-knuckled  punch-in-the-face is a long-needed wake-up call to nostalgic escapism.  Get mad instead.</p></div>"|14919.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14919-first-four-eps/|8.5|Paul Thompson

The roster for his Captured Tracks label is a veritable who's-who of any up-and-coming lo-fi indie bands, and his own hyper-prolific recording project, Blank Dogs, is no exception.  While some lo-fi groups have been accused of hiding their musical shortcomings with generous helpings of static, those claims can't be made against Sniper.  His self-avowed ""blown-out Factory Records demos"" are intentionally undercut by Sniper's distorted vocals.  The end result is a friction between vocals and music, akin to This Heat taking on the Joy Division catalog, and it raises Blank Dogs above most of their like-minded peers.</p>
<p>It might come as a shock to long-time fans, then, that<i> Land and Fixed</i> doesn't immediately sound like a Blank Dogs record.  The most obvious difference is the recording quality. The success of both Captured Tracks and Sniper's own music allowed him to purchase better recording equipment, and that's clearly evident from the first few seconds of ""Goes By"". Blank Dogs have always had synthesizers as part of their mix, but they've never been as prominent, or sounded as good as they do here.  It's a bold step forward, but it doesn't come at the expense of the group's innate wanderlust.  If anything, it's helped clarify its eclectic sound.  On previous records, the distended futuristic funk moves of ""Insides"" might have sounded oddly similar to the twee-pop of ""Northern Islands"" or the instrumental space-age voyage taken by ""Elevens"". Here, the quality of the recording lets these various flavors better distinguish themselves from each other, which goes a long way toward making the album an enjoyable listen.</p>
<p>However, the upgrade in fidelity doesn't come without a cost.  While the music on <i> Land and Fixed </i>revels in this newfound clarity, the vocals are still processed and manipulated.  Where that juxtaposition worked on earlier recordings (when the two sides were still on the same playing field), it doesn't coalesce nearly as well here. Tunes like ""Blurred Tonight"" and ""Languages"" could benefit from a more straightforward turn at the mic; they're instead subjected to the same obfuscated singing as other Blank Dogs songs.  Ironically, now that Blank Dogs have seemingly moved beyond the need for low-grade sonics, the band is leaning on that particular crutch more than ever.  Befitting the group's skittishness, the next Blank Dogs record is slated to be a set of instrumentals reminiscent of ""Elevens"", which will remove contending with this issue.  However, the next time Blank Dogs book some studio time to record their next set of vocals, here's hoping they show the same courage there that they've shown musically on <i>Land and Fixed</i>.</p></div>"|14933.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14933-land-and-fixed/|7.3|David Raposa

He and his Mountains partner-in-chime Brendon Anderegg gradually and intermittently layer different instruments-- mostly guitars, but also rattles, melodicas, and wood blocks-- using an array of pedals, eventually retreading into their laptops to wield the resulting chaos into a breathless, engulfing whorl. As a solo artist,Â Holtkamp crafted the most elaborate and varied record in the Mountains discography, 2008'sÂ <i>Field Rituals</i><i>,</i> which found him obfuscating field recordings though erosion and effects, then playing symphonic and folksy guitar and keyboard parts over them.Â <i>Gravity/Bees</i> is no less expansive in sound, but it's a smaller and more specific record.</p>
<p>The album, as its title suggests, is binary: Its two tracks, ""In the Absence of Gravity Please Note the Position of the Sun"" and ""Loosely Based on Bees"", scrape the 15-minute mark.Â Each is an alteration of a performance: The first morphs a live show in Brighton; the second, bees working in a hive.Â Unlike many of the selections on <i>Field Rituals</i>, which pulsated and liquefied, the two works here are horizontal and gaseous. The misty tones and harmonicas that open ""In the Absence of Gravity"" are punctured by the tapping stabs of acoustic guitar strings, imparting a spatial interference that is jarring at first but pleasant with more listens.</p>
<p>""Loosely Based on Bees"" has a more perverse trick up its sleeve: The opening murmur of bees is not the violent buzzing we might expect-- they're soothing and soft. But as instruments are added on, the music becomes more confrontational, as do the buzzing sounds. The implication is that things we find most frightening can often be peaceful, while things we find comforting can also end up frightening.</p>
<p>Like <i>Field Rituals</i>, <i>Gravity/Bees</i> is pleasant in sound but not dull enough to sink into the wallpaper. But unlike <i>Field Rituals</i>, its simultaneous expansion of space and reduction of texture makes it a little less confrontational. It doesn't make it less contemplative, but it's the kind of music that drifts, occasionally distracting yet otherwise hypnotically distant.</p></div>"|14910.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14910-gravitybees/|7.7|Tal Rosenberg

They've toured extensively at home, throughout the EU, and been billed at festivals from ATP to Pukkelpop.</p>
<p>They mostly forgot about the United States, though. While their post-punk peers and countrymen-- Foals, Arctic Monkeys-- have made frequent sojourns to American shores, Ansell and Carter have, for whatever reason, kept primarily in Europe. The band's first wide stateside exposure has come only recently, via the soundtrack to the Michael Cera flick <i>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</i>, which includes their song ""It's Getting Boring By the Sea"". It's too bad it took so long. Blood Red Shoes are an excellent riffs-and-rhythm rock band-- they make classic bash-and-scrape music with a debt to 1990s-era heroes Fugazi, Drive Like Jehu, and Nirvana.</p>
<p>Now word is starting to get around a little more. This fall Blood Red Shoes completed one blink-and-you'll-miss-it U.S. tour, and the band's sophomore effort, <i>Fire Like This</i>, has gotten a worldwide release, though it's iTunes-only in North America.Â It's as good an introduction to the band as any-- Blood Red Shoes haven't altered their sound too much over the years. But Ansell and Carter are clever enough shuffle the familiar elements around. Album opener ""Don't Ask"" hands over the chorus immediately, then falls back to a stop-start verse. They use the same trick on ""Keeping It Close""-- seizing attention with the hookiest, highest volume riff.</p>
<p>Ansell and Carter are relatively young-- 24 and 22 respectively-- but they've been around long enough to know how to avoid clichÃ©s. Ansell in particular is an old hand. He was a founding member ofÂ post-punk outfit Projections and emotional noisemakers Cat on Form, who released a few records on Southern. Both sing here, but Ansell gets most of the good lines. He has a bratty but melodic delivery that keeps the stripped-down verses chugging. Carter isn't bad, either, but she's too often stuck on ballad duty. The best moments come when they play off of one another-- trading off lines and alternating back-up duties, like the interplay on ""One More Empty Chair"".</p>
<p>On <i>Box of Secrets</i>, the pair limited their arrangements to herky-jerky blasts of distortion and drums. On <i>Fire Like This</i>, Blood Red Shoes favor slow builds-- stretching out repetitions for big, noisy crescendos. Those hands-in-the-air moments are not always within their grasp, however. Carter's ""When We Wake"" gets tedious during the three-minute climb toward its inevitable fuzz-box stomp. But ""Colours Fade"" unfolds into head-banging abandon.Â In its best moments, <i>Fire Like This</i> strikes a balance between heartfelt and heavy. Blood Red Shoes may be squat-hall sized, but they are arena-equipped.</p></div>"|14932.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14932-fire-like-this/|7.4|Aaron Leitko

As the frontman of Residual Echoes, he's crafted folk-rock drenched in acid and hung out to drip-dry in the California sun for almost seven years. But there's something about <i>Dead Head</i> that-- despite being Payne's ninth official release-- feels like a debut record.</p>
<p>It could be that this is the first solidified lineup of the band's history (drummer Allen Bleyle and bassist Greg Arnold make up the rhythm section); it could be that this record sounds far more polished than the rough, almost demo-like quality of past albums; but it's mostly because <i>Dead Head</i> has a greater sense of purpose than anything previously bearing the Residual Echoes name. After folky intro ""Warts"", the album goes into warp speed for the rest of its 38-minute run, with incinerating guitar solos shooting sparks all over the place.</p>
<p>More than two-thirds of ""Chopper"" is filled with this blistering six-string work, taking exploratory detours and tossing in a couple of seconds of stark silence before the blistering climax, recalling the nimble (and outrageously loud) fretwork of J Mascis. In fact, about six of the album's nine tracks adhere to this same template: fast tempo, exploratory guitar solo, hell, they're almost all written in the same <i>key</i>. The solos are always interesting, even bordering on remarkable, but the songs suffer from a lack of more diverse songwriting. The album's highlight, ""Fugks"", slows down the tempo and builds around a gorgeously laidback quasi-surf riff before settling into Neil Young-inspired songwriting. Sadly, it's one of the album's rare diversions into stylistic variety.</p>
<p>Essentially, <i>Dead Head</i> actually <i>does</i> play like Residual Echoes' debut release; everything is urgent and high-stakes, but it sounds more like the work of a young band settling into a sound, rather than a seasoned band knowing what works and using it as a springboard to see what else they can do.</p></div>"|14928.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14928-dead-head/|6.0|Martin Douglas

Their aesthetic is unmistakable-- the percussion is crisp and  in-the-pocket, the instrumentation is bone dry, and tight performances  get juxtaposed with moments of off-the-cuff improvisation. Their style  is so distinct that when Britt Daniel and Jim Eno have exported it to  various artists they've produced such as White Rabbits, Anya Marina, and  Sally Crewe, they all end up sounding more than a little bit like  Spoon.</p>
<p>Given  all of this deliberate studio craftsmanship, it's a little bit  surprising that they've made a practice of releasing a steady stream of  demo recordings on their official website. After all, most artists this  particular about their sound tend to shy away from putting out anything  that isn't flawlessly executed. Clearly, Spoon are not hung up about that  sort of thing: The 10 demos and alternate versions on <i>Bonus Tracks  2008-2009</i> present the band at their most sloppy and casual, offering  hardcore fans an intriguing glimpse into the group's creative process  without entirely demystifying what they do.</p>
<p>Aside  from having been initially given away as free mp3s on the Spoon website  between 2008 and 2009, there isn't any particular rhyme or reason to  the selection of recordings in this set. Aside from the non-album tune ""In the Right Place the Right Time"", all the songs are  from <i>Kill the Moonlight</i>, <i>Gimme Fiction</i>, or <i>Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</i>. In come  cases, like ""Rhythm &amp; Soul"" and ""Don't Let It Get You Down"", the  arrangements and performances aren't much different from what ended up  on album, though the recording is a lot more raw and lo-fi. These cuts  aren't particularly interesting or useful. It's more fun to hear them  put a country rock spin on a familiar song like ""You Got Yr. Cherry  Bomb"", or attempt a version of ""Was It You?"" that integrates elements  from electro and Afrobeat.</p>
<p>Only  a couple of tracks offer any sort of clear window on the band's  songwriting process. The version of ""My Mathematical Mind"" here is  especially rough and bare bones, sounding almost as though Daniel is  still writing the song as he plays it while ad libbing silly provisional  lyrics like ""I'm gonna try chicken-fried snake."" He's similarly playful  and loose on the ""writing exercise"" version of ""Eddie's Raga"", which  is about half the length of what appears on <i>Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga</i> though more  or less fully formed.</p>
<p>The  most frustrating thing about <i>Bonus Tracks</i> is that for a compilation of  this nature, it's not nearly complete enough to be satisfying. It's over  and out in less than a half hour, and while that may be perfectly  reasonable in terms of listenability, this small arbitrary collection of  demos only scratches the surface of what ought to be the band's answer  to the Beatles' <i>Anthology</i> or Guided By Voices' <i>Suitcase</i> series. While it's nice that the band apparently  values concision even when it comes to vault-clearing stocking-stuffer  releases, it seems to miss the point of putting this stuff out there in  the first place. If we want to listen to an album, we'll put on one of  the studio records. However, if we're feeling nerdy enough to check out a  band's unfinished demos, it's better to pore over dozens at a time  while attempting to glean some insight into their methods. Maybe that  would be giving too much away, but honestly, if Spoon are going to go  this far with things, they may as well go all the way.</p></div>"|14930.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14930-bonus-tracks-2008-2009/|6.3|Matthew Perpetua

He's written arrangements and orchestrations for Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy, Sam Amidon, Grizzly Bear, and Antony &amp; the Johnsons, among others. It also helps that he worked as an editor, conductor, and keyboardist with Philip Glass, whose eloquent minimalism is already a touchstone for many indie and electronic music fans. But the crucial thing is simply Muhly's compositional voice. His minimal, Neo-Romantic style has a balance of graceful form and emotional generosity that resonates with listeners who are more interested in personal statements than musicology. And his freehanded use of electronics, drones, and fluttering pulses blurs his classicism into accessible shades of post-rock.</p>
<p>Muhly embodies the corroding boundary between classical and popular music, but the two worlds remain distinct in some ways. Classical fans often favor the concert hall, with recorded music as a secondary concern; the reverse is often true in indie and pop. Muhly has proven particularly adept at splitting the difference. He's written lots of music for performance that doesn't appear on any recording. He's also cherry-picked this repertoire to piece together two albums with the kind of modular structure that non-classical music fans are accustomed to, 2007's <i>Speaks Volumes</i> and 2008's <i>Mothertongue</i>. Both of the new albums Muhly released this year are beholden to external forces, so neither is necessarily the pop-friendly artifact you might be waiting for. <i>I Drink the Air Before Me</i>, the score for a dance by choreographer Stephen Petronio, is more esoteric than <i>Mothertongue</i>. <i>A Good Understanding</i>, a choral work written for the Los Angeles Master Chorale, might be ""too classical"" for casual fans. But both have a lot to offer, and taken together, they comprise a fascinating study in adaptability. Appropriately, <i>Drink</i> is as physical as <i>Good</i> is ethereal, though in each case, Muhly's brash, lyrical sensibility shines through.</p>
<p>Working with an ensemble of flute, viola, bassoon, trombone, upright bass, piano, and electronics, Muhly and Petronio made a set of rules for <i>Drink</i>: ""Start small, get big""; begin and end with a children's choir; evoke weather with lots of ""irregular, spiral-shaped music."" The influence of John Adams is palpable in the craggy piano parts. You can hear it on ""Music Under Pressure 2 - Piano"", and on ""Salty Dog"", where corkscrews of sharps and flats trouble an otherwise jaunty woodwind line. ""Music Under Pressure 1 - Flute"", on the other hand, has a Glassian depth and fluidity, with its light flute melody and heavy undercarriage. The overall feeling is neurotic and twitchy, with even the most elegant moments frequently wandering into murkier territory. Throughout, Muhly realizes some magical effects, like transforming string drones into a wilting melody on ""Varied Carols"". At times, though, the thematic content becomes so disjointed it threatens to break down, and also occasionally errs in the other direction. ""Jagged Pulses"" is tight and satisfying, though Muhly making a track called ""Jagged Pulses"" is like Sonic Youth naming one ""Arty Guitar Feedback""-- no surprise.</p>
<p>If <i>Drink</i> sometimes feels a mite incomplete away from its intended use as a dance score, <i>A Good Understanding</i> is remarkably whole. Its mostly-religious songs draw upon traditional Anglican choral music, as well as Muhly's recollections of being a boy chorister. As opposed to the pushy and ostentatious <i>Drink</i>, it's calm and centered. Muhly inscribes his personality onto the antique holiness of the texts and structures with uncommon humility and reverence. His personal stamps-- high contrast timbres, deep bass, hummingbird motifs-- are intact, but subordinated to the crystalline vocals of the Los Angeles Master Chorale. Muhly's keyboard is mixed low, merely glinting through the first part of ""Bright Mass with Canons"", and rippling through the second with Terry Riley-like insistence, coloring the tiered vocal harmonies. The chant-like invocation of the word ""Senex"" at the beginning of ""Senex Puerum Portabat"" retroactively highlights the traditional choral influences lurking behind the high-modern faÃ§ade of the first part of <i>Mothertongue</i>. The infrequent instrumental flourishes Muhly allows himself hit harder than on <i>Drink</i>, which can seem nothing but flourishes at times. For listeners who only get down with the most overt crossover attempts in classical music, it might feel uncomfortably like going to Sunday services. For others, it will show a reticent side of Muhly that adds an intriguing dimension to his character.</p></div>"|14914.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14914-i-drink-the-air-before-me-a-good-understanding/|7.4|Brian Howe

It's actually fitting that the 2xCD <i>Volume On</i> is a European-only release, since Tanlines' blindingly bright synth-pop has more in common with jetsetters like Tough Alliance, Delorean, and Studio-- acts that are influenced by the sounds of the tropics rather than just the idea of them.</p>
<p>You won't get much of an idea of what Tanlines actually sounds like from Cohen and Emm's backgrounds (Professor Murder and Don Caballero, respectively). But what has been carried forward from earlier projects is a lab-rat work ethic that makes <i>Volume On</i> more than a bunch of obvious signifiers. Sure, the kick drum insistently hits on every beat and the percussion tempts Miami Sound Machine jokes, but the songs here are always playful and never pushy. It's dance music if you want it to be, maintaining a Balearic vibe without being wholly tied to it.</p>
<p>It's hard to say if Tanlines' real strength is production or songwriting, but <i>Volume On</i> has its share of highlights where they do both. ""Real Life"", the song that has become Tanlines' signature track, is a regular presence here. In addition to its original version, there three remixes of the song on the second disc, including a smeared-lens rendering by Memory Tapes. The song endures even in the dead of winter in large part because it's the best showcase of Emm's odd melodic charm as a vocalist, and ""You might think I'm still that way... It was a past-life thing"" stands up as a strangely affecting mea culpa.</p>
<p>More prominent here than on this year's <i>Settings</i> EP, Emm's vocals are a strange, sonorous thing that occasionally morph into something Sting-like but also have the go-for-it spirit of the Rapture's Luke Jenner (who appears here on new song ""O Seizing The Day O""). By the same token, his voice doesn't work particularly well in isolation. Like on the acoustic version of ""Real Life"", which is startling any way you slice it. It's a complete sonic anomaly within the confines of <i>Volume On</i>, but Emm's vocal delivery isn't altered one bit and turns out to be entirely at odds with the arrangement.</p>
<p><i>Volume On</i> isn't officially Tanlines' first album, but it doesn't sound like a hastily cobbled-together bid for year-end lists either. In fact, it holds together almost too well. They work within a pretty narrow range of BPM's and the textural sleekness can have a dazing cumulative effect over the span of <i>Volume On</i>'s hour-plus runtime. Nonetheless, the promise is there. Tanlines obviously know how to properly book an island getaway, but it could really be something special if they can learn to diversify the itinerary.</p></div>"|14931.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14931-volume-on/|7.0|Ian Cohen

The husband-and-wife pair run Someone Good, while Lawrence curates sister imprint Room40, a preeminent experimental label that has recently put out records by the ambient-inclined Grouper and Tim Hecker. Someone Good takes a more modest, domestic view of gorgeous textural abstraction, releasing music often by Japan-based artists: avant-twee couple Lullatone, piano minimalist Akira Kosemura, Tenniscoats offshoot Nikasaya. This is simple yet elegant stuff.</p>
<p>As Miko, Tokyo-based Rie Mitsutake assembles vividly mic'd piano, acoustic guitar, and off-kilter percussion-- along with field recordings and her own hushed vocals-- into languidly immersive sound worlds that make the familiar wonderfully strange. Her 2008 debut,Â <i>Parade</i>, successfully introduced the basic elements of Miko's developing aesthetic, but that effort placed a greater emphasis on glimmering electronics and at times used near-shoegaze levels of ear-splitting distortion. Sophomore album <i>Chandelier</i>, like Kosemura's excellentÂ <i>Polaroid Piano</i> from last year, takes a turn toward the organic. The result shapes restrained, homespun instrumentation into something at once quaint and futuristic.</p>
<p>Someone Good is billing Miko's latest as a ""new kind of folk music,"" and that's apt. Bird-like squawks and delicate vocals transcend their potential cutesiness to attain a sort of ascetic grace (""Sea House""); Talk Talk-inclined drums gently splash behind indie pop plinks and plonks (""Kikoeru""); saxophones drift past thrumming acoustic guitar (""New Town""). When Miko sings the word ""America"", on the hypnotic track of the same name, she conjures up a faraway place vastly different from the one I know.Â Compared with traditional folk song, there's certainly more attention paid to what words and sounds sugges

t rather than their literal meanings.

(Apparently Miko chose the title <i>Chandeliers</i> as much for its spoken sound as for its associations with light and warmth). But there's also a sense of intimacy, of basic human connection, on which the old avant-garde might look with disdain. That would be missing the point.</p></div>"|14846.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14846-chandelier/|7.5|Marc Hogan

He developed acute forms of anxiety and agoraphobia, which he worked out, then went to the Himalayas to study Tibetan music, living in a monastery and not speaking for months. Since then, he's integrated himself within the burgeoning underground experimental scene; Daniel Lopatin, aka synth-drone alchemist Oneohtrix Point Never, even brought him and his music to of-the-moment label Hippos in Tanks.</p>
<p>D'eon's personal history and line of study are relatively fascinating; I wish that personal experience would've informed the music on his debut LP, <i>Palinopsia</i>, just a bit more. There's some ephemeral flourishes of Eastern music figures here and there, but the record feels more like a collection of well-executed genre exercises than anything else. ""Well-executed"" is the key adjective, though; untangle the hypnotic knot of synths underneath ""2040"" and you'll find the backing track for a lost 1980s electro-pop cut. ""What We Want to Be"" is a straightforward slice of euphoric piano house, while ""Keep the Faith"" falls in line with the latest fashion of embracing mainstream R&amp;B signifiers. However, the most noteworthy contemporaries in that line of sound (How to Dress Well, Autre Ne Veut) have applied their own skewed vision to that particular genre; here, D'eon basically plays it straight. He does a good job across the board here, but you might be left a little wanting for something more chewy to sink your teeth into.</p>
<p>The other main issue with <i>Palinopsia</i> is D'eon's voice: Not specifically how he sings, which ranges from a meditative croon to a histrionic whine without much room for accessibility in between, but what he's saying. There's a vaguely socio-political vibe to D'eon's music, and its somewhat message-muddled application doesn't always ad

d up. The electronic epilepsy of ""Kill a Man With a Joystick in Your Hand"" does well to convey heat-stroked modern combat in foreign lands, but it's not easy to scan his intent when he sings, ""Everybody want to fuck with the Taliban/ All the way from Kabul to Pakistan"". Conversations in college common rooms are unintentionally evoked in ""Keep the Faith"" (""Why don't you stay with me a little while/ And talk about the things we do to survive""), while the record's ideological nadir, ""Recession Proof ($40 Paycheque)"" goes from complaining about (you guessed it) a $40 paycheck to, uh, this: ""The ocean is a sewer/ The city is a whore/ Money in the toilet/ Oil on the shore."" The imagery is serviceable but clichÃ©d; like the most well-tread parts of <i>Palinopsia</i>, it could use a fresh twist.</p></div>"|14921.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14921-palinopsia/|6.2|Larry Fitzmaurice

In recent years, the bands that have earned the most attention and acclaim have generally used what began as Scandinavian misfit rock to springboard into something epic. Wolves in the Throne Room's atmospheric bombast, then, aligns with Alcest's haunted dreamscapes. Deathspell Omega's mean psychedelic crunch links with the scorched expanses of Horseback and Locrian. Sure, plenty of recalcitrant bands-- Watain, Akitsa, the intractable Immortal-- adhere to decades-old, fast-blasting strictures. But from the keys and strings Emperor used to the sense of grandiosity Mayhem promulgated, orchestral elements and widescreen scope have consistently been part of knotty ol' black metal. On their fourth album, Portland, Ore., quartet Agalloch peerlessly unify both camps. As atmospheric as it is aggressive, as reliant upon old-school bona fides as on imaginative flourishes, <i>Marrow of the Spirit</i> confirms Agalloch's place at the frontier of American metal.</p>
<p><i>Marrow of the Spirit</i> begins, as have each of Agalloch's three previous LPs, with a reflective instrumental. A forlorn cello moans over field recordings of a brisk stream and chattering birds, mixed so that each element feeds into the others. Together, they offer an image of melancholy, energy, and beauty that serves as a prelude in the most proper sense. Agalloch deals in light and dark here, moving beyond simple damnation and apocalypse to consider escape and renewal, too. Through a series of sketches and scenes, frontman John Haughm offers desolation and collapse-- ""I slumber in clouds of ice/ These are my hands... so it is done,"" he groans during the opener. The next hour is a tug of war between retreat and rebirth. ""There are gods in the wake of the very flame,"" he sings at the album's other end, placing his hope in a hopeless void.</p>
<p>The music here mirrors that message, a trait that requires dynamic, diverse, and compelling arrangements. Introduction excepted, <i>Marrow of the Spirit</i>'s five tracks range from 10 to 18 minutes in length, and, more often than not, one marathon simply segues into another. Though the album breaks well past the hour mark, Agalloch couple economy and pacing with imagination and ideas in a way that should make most black metal bands green with envy. The 12-minute ""Into the Painted Grey"", for instance, maneuvers with enough agility that its runtime feels appropriate. It transitions from ascendant guitar solos to relentless, howling stampedes, twisting the two again and again into blissful terror. A barely audible 12-string acoustic guitar laces much of the track, adding ballast to the blast. That guitar serves as the bridge into ""The Watcher's Monolith"", itself a perfect distillation of the breadth that's made Agalloch matter for the last decade. Spider-webbing from folk-rock smolder to mid-tempo thrash, from hair-metal guitar workouts to dirge-like chants, ""The Watcher's Monolith"" plays like an unpredictable, seamless mixtape of Agalloch's strengths.</p>
<p>And that's the key: Many of Agalloch's peers in bending black metal manipulate it one way or another, then simply revisit, retread, and retrench. For Agalloch, though, black metal is just the thread that ties together dozens of different looks, be it the industrial roar and mid-tempo climb that characterize ""Black LakeÂ NiÃ°stÃ¥ng"" or the saturating sustains that spread from one end of closer ""To Drown"" to the other. ""Ghosts of the Midwinter Fires"" sprints and twists like a lost take from Maserati or Mogwai, its chiseled guitar line leading the way through sharp turns. But just as Alcest did on this year's excellent <i>Ãcailles de Lune</i>, Agalloch almost always retain a stylistic placeholder, be it rolling blast beats or Haughm's lacerated exhortations. Black metal, then, becomes a compositional catalyst, not a stylistic restraint.</p>
<p>Agalloch don't tour much, picking and choosing their tour dates and bill-mates based on what they find interesting. In March, they flew to Romania to play two shows with Alcest for free, though they've barely played within their own country at all. The band seldom offers interviews, either. ""We believe in having a spectacular experience rather than touring constantly and making a lot of money,"" Haughm told a Brooklyn Vegan writer who made that trip to Romania, too. ""We're not interested in hype, or all this rock-star bullshit. We're fine if we're at an underground cult base forever."" Similar ideas have cultivated audiences for the formerly hermetic songwriter Jandek and veteran masked emcee DOOM. But black metal itself has started to seep closer to mainstream culture, both through its influence on other artists and in acknowledgment from big media outlets. Agalloch's cult status might not be so safe, then. On <i>Marrow of the Spirit</i>, Agalloch successfully springboard from a foundation of black metal to an intriguing sort of polyglot rock that never seems contrived or forced and always surprises. Very few records sound like this-- yet, anyway.</p></div>"|14920.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14920-marrow-of-the-spirit/|8.5|Grayson Haver Currin

We get it: limiting, it boxes you in.  Dylan wasn't just folk, Pearl Jam weren't merely grunge, and nobody-- <i>nobody</i>-- will cop to being chillwave.  So have a little respect for Horsepower Productions, the decade-old UK production team who don't seem to be in any hurry to discard the dubstep label.  If anyone has a rightful claim to it, it's ringleader Benny Ill and his cohorts, whose dub-heavy early B-sides were, by many accounts, the inspiration for the term.</p>
<p>After a six-year hiatus, <i>Quest for the Sonic Bounty</i> is the second proper Horsepower Productions LP (following 2004's <i>To the Rescue</i>; their landmark debut, <i>In Fine Style</i>, was partly a compilation), arriving at a time when dubstep enjoys fringe mainstream appeal.Â <i>Quest</i> thankfully isn't a transparent attempt to capitalize on reputation, but neither does it sound like a labor of love.  Instead it sounds like plain ol' labor, as if someone spent a lot of time worrying about this music. The album's title is probably a joke, but with a nod to that threadbare line about jokes containing elements of truth.</p>
<p>Benny Ill, the last remaining member of the original HP team, now works with another producer, Jay King, and it sounds as if the duo have internalized dubstep's touchstones.Â They began as true dance producers, making garage and 2-step; they play with dubplates and have collaborated with Lee Perry; their albums feature obscure movie quotes recalling mid-1990s American hip-hop (Wu-Tang are an obvious touchstone).  The album opens with nearly a minute of rain and deeply echoing keyboard chords before a skittering beat kicks in; one minute later, the signature bass wobble and some vaguely rave-y sirens sound.  And there you have it: dubstep. If the genre's other leading names want to be <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14519-outside-the-box/"">pop stars</a>, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14955-limit-to-your-love/"">bards</a>, or <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/"">shut-ins</a>, then HP are content to focus on the music.</p>
<p><i>Quest</i> isn't the type of wretched, bigger/louder/wobblier dubstep that now plagues a lot of clubs and DJ sets.  The album sounds best on a great system where its bass can dominate, but its largess supports the album's general tone and cinematic scope.  The dialogue samples almost seem to suggest a narrative; survival and water are themes.  On the group's remix of Lee ""Scratch"" Perry's ""Exercising"" (on CD for the first time here), it's clear that Benny Ill could more often use a shaman/muse whose natural strangeness augments the HP's concussed worldview.  Still: ""Water"" absolutely explodes; ""Damn It"" is bright, sampledelic reggae.  ""Poison Wine"" takes its Middle Eastern vocal samples and turns them into schizoid house divas.</p>
<p>A search for one of the album's movie quotes-- from 1983's <i>Stryker</i>-- led me to <a href=""http://www.madmaxmovies.com/films/mad-max-imitations/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a page dedicated to movies that ripped off </a><i><a href=""http://www.madmaxmovies.com/films/mad-max-imitations/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mad Max</a></i>.  This is an unkind-- but funny-- metaphor for a genre whose dregs have made a living Xeroxing sonic oblivion.  When I listen to <i>Quest</i>, I miss the relatively weightless stir of <i>In Fine Style</i>; it seems clear that the last decade of UK body music has gotten to Benny Ill.  A new Horsepower Productions album offers the opportunity to reflect on dubstep's past, and <i>Quest</i>, for better and worse, sounds a lot like its blueprint, even if plans have changed drastically in the interim.</p></div>"|14922.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14922-quest-for-the-sonic-bounty/|6.3|Andrew Gaerig

It has no English equivalent, unless there's an obscure English word that means ""putting potatoes on to boil, going fishing, and then preparing the fish with the potatoes."" The uniquely Scandinavian concept suits the uniquely Scandinavian music. Torske's blend of playful austerity and wistful wonderment can also be found in his Smalltown Supersound compatriots, from diskJokke to LindstrÃ¸m to Kim HiorthÃ¸y. The title also evokes the relaxed, patiently simmering quality of the album, which boils down Torske's long-running fixations upon dub, cosmic disco, house, and Balearic sounds into a highly refined personal style. Sophisticatedly minimal, <i>Kokning</i> improves upon 2007's excellent <i>Feil Knapp</i> by retaining yet streamlining Torske's idiosyncrasies.</p>
<p>To create the album, Torske recorded instrumental parts in various places and then edited them together with rhythm tracks. His sensitivity as a producer makes the album, for all the styles it lightly flits through, an organic room-tone odyssey at heart: alive with inventive sounds and warm with feeling. It opens with three wonderful, ultra-mellow cuts that slide you into Torske's sound-world with zero friction. On the title track, liquidly hypnotic phrases for clean electric guitar weave through shining ambiance, with just a couple of alternating plucks coolly marking time. ""Bryggesjau"" is a clip-clopping set piece for acid-bright guitar riffs in taut counterpoint, and ""Gullfjellet"" features rich nylon strings and watery synths, rooted by the calm thump of a kick drum. Besides their appealing sound palettes, the great thing about these tracks is how deliberately they take on definition. By the time the dancier middle run of songs come around, you're deeply immersed.</p>
<p>This middle run is marked by lots of intricate hand percussion, funk progressions, and proggy keyboard swirls, though it retains the light
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
touch and hint of critical distance that characterize the opening tracks. ""Slitte Sko"" is the sort of casual, chiming beat workout that Arthur Russell liked to cook up, and ""Bergensere"" calls Prins Thomas to mind with its arch yet passionate funk. As the album progresses, Torske gets more unleashed, slathering ""Nitten Nitti"" with a goofy-fun vocal synth arpeggio and framing stylized dub reggae with monster-party samples on ""Versjon Wolfenstein"". After the more focused songs preceding it, the 12-minute closing epic ""Furu"" is a bit long-winded for my tastes, but at least it feels earned. It also makes me feel Torske is naturally inclined to stretching out-- even his short pieces here have a sense of endless range-- which makes his restraint elsewhere all the more admirable. His shorter tracks have a diorama-like sense of compact but vivid detail, and the merest gestures make big impacts. Unflashy and muted, Torske gets less props than some of his peers. With any justice, <i>Kokning</i> will correct this slight.</p></div>"|14885.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14885-kokning/|8.0|Brian Howe

The opening bars of <i>Public Service Announcement</i> by Purling Hiss bring to mind such an image, but the album turns out to be a little more complicated than that.</p>
<p>If underground rock music has spent the past couple of years skewing rough and lo-fi, toying with ideas that lean away from actual structure or fully completed pieces, then Purling Hiss (aka Mike Polizze, who also plays in Birds of Maya, a band that kicks around Philadelphia with Kurt Vile) takes the idea to its logical conclusion. Songs bend under warped tape while guitars jam up into upper-register treble. Listen to <i>Public Service Announcement</i> on mediocre headphones, and it can sound like watery background static. But a situation involving staring at a wall and focusing on the record while accepting its controlled mania can be rewarding.</p>
<p>Tracks like ""Porch Dude/Slight Return"" begin with a perfectly normal riff. But then the tape wobbles and the music sounds like an accident that's been reigned in and controlled. The jams are given shape and then ripped apart by recording technique. And these days, when an album sounds this imperfect, you have to assume there's a reason. It's 2010, and recording pristine songs takes little more than a good mic and some pirated editing software. It's up to artists to recreate primitive, raw recordings artificially, and Purling Hiss uses this rawness as a dominant instrument. Without these smudges, <i>Public Service Announcement</i> could play out as an off-kilter, potentially flat version of recycled AM radio gold. With these imperfections, though, it sits comfortably beside other sonic innovators with a vital pop music heart: Ariel Pink, John Maus, and even at times a stony version of Phil Elverum's warm, all encompassing ambient hiss.</p>
<p>But if <i>Public Service Announcement</i> finds its comfort in rambling experimentation, then its main fault is how drawn out it is. It's the risk that comes when you stuff the music with a million ideas that are about halfway there. Nothing sticks around too long-- except, unfortunately, on ""Malice in Wonderland"", when the guitar grind sounds like a propeller plane taking off for about five solid minutes. Beyond that, it's a challenging record in the best way, splitting the difference between easy nostalgia and a windswept take on pop experimentation.</p></div>"|14916.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14916-public-service-announcement/|7.4|Sam Hockley-Smith

Simultaneously defensive and defiant, she seems to rebuke you for seeing her in this state of undress, hips and tattoos exposed. We get other band members' asses, too, but Invie's is front and center, which is only appropriate: The band's songs are cleverly arranged and expressively performed, but Invie's vocals remain the focal point. While it's tempting to suggest she lays herself similarly bare in her lyrics, in truth she is slightly more guarded, writing songs whose meanings must be puzzled out and singing them in a voice that sounds refracted, as if we're hearing her through a mirror.</p>
<p>Invie's an intriguing presence on <i>Wild Go</i>, which traffics in pristine, moody chamber pop that's light on hooks but heavy on stark atmosphere. Working with producer Tom Herbers (Low) in Minneapolis and Duluth, the band itself proves agile and inventive, opening ""In Your Dreams"" at an abrupt gallop, rushing us into the album <i>in medias res</i> as the members provide backing vocals that sound like a Balkan choir practicing next door. There are hints of Beirut in ""Celebrate"", of an artier Hem in ""Daydreaming"", of a less wild Wild Colonials in ""Say the Word"", of chanson on the title track, and perhaps Dark Dark Dark's true accomplishment here is how they mix sounds and influences so effortlessly. They comprise a tight, intuitive unit, especially when the instruments swirl together into an otherworldly eddy of sound. They even know enough to back off the spectral ""Robert"", which is mostly Invie at her piano.</p>
<p>""What do words mean to me now?"" she asks on ""Say the Word"", possibly explaining the cumbersome band name and awkward album title. She never lets on which words she's talking about or what they might have meant in the past; as with the album cover, she knows that the glimpse of a part is more engrossing than a gawk at the whole. Occasionally, the songs threaten to blur together and lose their distinctiveness, yet she makes <i>Wild Go</i> sound tough-minded and questioning. That makes it only more egregious when banjo and clarinet player Marshall LaCount takes over vocals from her on ""Right Path"" and ""Heavy Heart"". He has a thin, slightly reedy voice and a tendency toward overenunciation; it's not unpleasant, but relatively pedestrian. Moreover, in the context of the album it's disruptive, breaking the careful spell of the music. The band works via accumulation, gradually building up to moments of muted drama, yet LaCount's leads wreck that momentum.</p></div>"|14926.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14926-wild-go/|6.7|Stephen M.

The show was a final dress rehearsal at 3 Mills Studios in London, a few weeks before the Sigur RÃ³s frontman's proper debut LP, <i>Go</i>, was released and his theatrical, projection-bolstered live setup would hit the road for much of 2010. There were women donning feathered headdresses, kids with furry earmuffs, and grown men in bear outfits nursing beers. Also amongst the crowd was a camera crew on hand to capture the event, footage of which has been spliced together with backstage scenes and interviews to comprise the visual half of <i>Go Live</i>, a DVD/CD available exclusively on JÃ³nsi's <a href=""http://www.jonsi.com/go_live"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a> (and, apparently, in some Japanese shops). While the live audio recordings here were culled from a later show in Brussels, the relationship between the two halves is close. That scene in London mirrors what's been happening on every stage he took this year, the often playful, always kinetic spirit of <i>Go</i> come to life in more than one way.</p>
<p>Because JÃ³nsi's only got the one record of his own material, he bulked up his setlist with tracks that are seeing release together for the first time here. Songs like the stately, fingerpicked opener ""Stars in Still Water"", forgettable ""New Piano Song"", or his contribution to the <i>How to Train Your Dragon</i> OST, ""Sticks &amp; Stones"", add an extra layer of muscle to his sparse catalogue.</p>
<p>One of the major challenges JÃ³nsi faced when bringing <i>Go</i> to the stage was in figuring out how to translate the indelible studio contributions of composer Nico Muhly and percussionist Samuli Kosminen. Each track here has been reworked terrifically, Muhly's lively flourishes sometimes left behind for ambience's sake, but never far at all. Instead, like in the nearly three-minute intro to ""Tornado"", a similar magic and color is conjured by bells, piano flurries, and xylophonic tapestry. In that vein, ""Boy Lilikoi"" feels warmer and more spritely. JÃ³nsi's band has been able to generate extraordinary levels of texture, the crisp sound of live percussion alone enough to give already strong arrangements new breath.</p>
<p>As compelling as the many visual elements (see the Never Never Land sartorial decisions, atavistic animations, interview snippets, HD everything) on the DVD can be, the Fifty Nine Productions-helmed film is more a document of their concepts than the actual JÃ³nsi live experience. That's why the album itself seems all the more necessary. The sonics are appropriately huge, and there at its center is an instrument that's better recorded than it could ever be filmed: JÃ³nsi's voice. It arches, it splays, it cloys, it still coats everything here with expansive, far-reaching qualities that befit the cinematic nature of his songwriting.</p>
<p>What's particularly special about <i>Go Live</i> is the fact that Jonsi's vocalizing loses the safety netting and sheen it enjoys in a studio. There are moments, like in the early quiet of closer ""Grow Till Tall"", when he goes unimaginably high, his cords unable to hold up as long as he'd like. You can hear him inhale and you can hear his voice give out ever so briefly. Part of the appeal in seeing JÃ³nsi (or Sigur RÃ³s for that matter) in a live setting for the first/any time is being able to attach faces to often-faceless music. When JÃ³nsi's voice cracks, what was alien on record now sounds positively human.</p></div>"|14924.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14924-go-live/|7.9|David Bevan

But 2008's third full-length, <i>Do You Like Rock Music?</i>, took those impulses one step-- make that one thousand steps-- further. That record found the Brighton band attempting to ascend to the life-affirming, million-dollar chorus ranks of stadium-ready rock merchants like U2. It was a gamble, and in retrospect, it paid off thanks to their flair for structure and ear-pleasing melody. Even the most ardent fan, though, had to wonder: What if all this blustering ambition had outstripped the actual songwriting?</p>
<p><i>Zeus</i>, BSP's new EP leading up to their forthcoming LP, <i>Valhalla Dancehall</i>, answers that question. Unfortunately, that's probably the most positive thing you could say about the release. <i>Zeus</i> is bloated in the most indulgent sense, right down to the running time and song lengths (42 minutes for an eight-song release, with three tunes careening well past the seven-minute mark). Unlike their previous rock-oriented releases, there's no unifying theme running throughout the record. Multiple stylistic shifts take place from song to song or, in the case of the overstuffed opening track ""Zeus"", within a single tune. This grab-bag conceit makes it hard to pinpoint what, exactly, went wrong here: is it the Auto-Tuned(!) glam rock of ""kW-h"", or the skronky faux-motorik of ""Mongk"" that directly precedes it? Did the aptly named closer ""Retreat"" need to be nine minutes long? Does the ultra-filtered shouty goof ""Can We Do It?"" need to exist at all? There's very little here in the way of the meaty hooks and melodies that were once the band's trademark.</p>
<p><i>Zeus</i> feels more of a house-cleaning release than anything else, and the promotional materials describe the EP as a ""wild and wunderbar-wonky precursor"" to <i>Valhalla Dancehall</i>. The preview of that record offered here, ""Cleaning Out the Rooms"", is a case in point. The song is as overstuffed as the rest of the EP, but its ethereal build suggests Sigur RÃ³s at their most crushingly beautiful-- even though there's not much to grab on to other than that perpetual swell. There's a new album on the horizon, but <i>Zeus</i> is still disappointing. They've taken time to flex their experimental muscles o good effect, (see: last year's film soundtrack <i>Man of Aran</i>), but the return to big rock and proper songs is unconvincing. If you want to create anthems, you need to get people singing along.</p></div>"|14908.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14908-zeus-ep/|5.0|Larry Fitzmaurice

Gospel Music, the near-impossible-to-Google new project by Jacksonville's Owen Holmes (the bass player in question), is an attempt to erase the memory of the overblown, glossy production and mannered songwriting of Black Kids'Â <i>Partie Traumatic</i> by making music that is its polar opposite: immediate, slightly sloppy, and charmingly casual. And <i>Duettes</i>, the band's maddeningly spelled debut EP, succeeds as a brief-but-likable collection of purposefully lo-fi pop songs that are long on infectious melodies but short on arty pretension.</p>
<p>In fact, if no one told youÂ <i>Duettes</i> had a thing to do with Black Kids, you would never guess. Holmes naturally has the low, gravelly voice and occasional monotone of Calvin Johnson or Adam Green, and he has smartly crafted raw, minimalist songs in the vein of Beat Happening or the Moldy Peaches to fit those vocals. Instead of his other band's synth-driven sound, the keyboard instruments that Holmes plays on this album (like toy piano or vintage organ) are used sparingly as decoration, and the melodies are instead steered by acoustic guitars or rootsy banjos. And the lyrics, which eschew complicated metaphors or grand ideas, are clever and conversational, like something a friend or the drunk on the next barstool has said to you before.</p>
<p>Considering their simple arrangements, these songs are driven forward by Holmes' finely detailed stories. On ""Gamophobia"", Holmes lists all the actions he's willing to take for his beloved if she'll just ""stop asking for a wedding ring."" It's an ""I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That)"" for committed singles. And ""Reinheitsgebot"", which takes its name from a German beer-brewing law, elegantly captures the painful, I'm-doing-fine posturing that follows a breakup. Every verse announces a new, exciting hobby the narrator has taken up, from home-brewing to marathon-running, or a vice that he's quit, like smoking, but the real message of the song lies in its chorus: ""You didn't get the best of me. The best of me came after you. Now it's being wasted on someone new,"" yet listeners can sadly tell that the man doth protest too much.</p>
<p>Holmes smartly sought out a winning team of vocal collaborators for <i>Duettes</i>' five tracks-- hence the album's title. Though he does duet with one man-- Hefner's Darren Hayman on ""Reinheitsgebot""-- his songs sound best when his baritone speak-singing is bolstered by a sweet, girlish voice, allowing listeners to revel in the sound of their opposition. On the bouncy, call-and-response ""Automobile"", that voice comes from Camera Obscura's Tracyanne Campbell; on the Silver Jews-ish ""I Miss the Shit Out of You"" his partner is French singer Soko; and playing up Gospel Music's resemblance to the Magnetic Fields at their most skeletal, that band's Shirley Simms plays the role of the marriage-hungry lover on ""Gamophobia"".</p>
<p>The EP's closing track, ""Are Your Parents Still Together?"", plays like a brief, minute-and-a-half conversation between Holmes and Vivian Girls' Cassie Ramone. Backed by Ramone's gooey ""ooh wah ooh""s, the two singers trade barbs about stereotypically perfect families (""Is your father a professor? Is mom a fiction writer? Do they pledge to public radio, and make their own pasta dough?"") while sussing out whether they will make good partners for each other, vowing at the end of the song to ""do it better"" than their parents did. It is, perhaps, the most nakedly sentimental moment of the album, but it doesn't feel corny, thanks to the song's offhand tone and unfussy production.</p>
<p>The album is brief, and given its messy, tossed-off vibe, it may feel too slapdash or inessential to some listeners. But fans of lo-fi pop would be hard-pressed not to be won over by his lyrical specificity, melodic infectiousness, and vocal collaborators. Considering that we have been waiting for a redemptive follow-up for <i>Partie Traumatic</i> for almost three years, perhaps Holmes' other band should take a cue from their bass player: Don't overthink it. When it comes to pop music, it is often better to be spontaneous than overworked.</p></div>"|14913.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14913-duettes/|7.3|Rebecca Raber

It had moments as relaxing and soothing as a new age record, yet Soft Circle mainman Hisham Bharoocha's work in neo-no-wave acts Lightning Bolt and Black Dice meant <i>Full Bloom</i> occasionally strayed into darker, uglier, and more abrasive terrain.</p>
<p>Like many of his 21st-century contemporaries, Bharoocha suggested that pretty, meditative noise was only a few knob cranks away from becoming fearsome, plug-your-ears noise. That philosophy still drives <i>Shore Obsessed</i>. Take a cursory listen, though, and you might not even think it's the work of the same man who produced <i>Full Bloom</i>. Unlike that long, meandering album, <i>Shore Obsessed</i> is built out of short, tight <i>dance</i> songs.  You can actually shake your stuff to these 10 synth-pop and disco tunes-- while singing along, no less-- which certainly isn't something you could have said about any of Bharoocha's other projects.</p>
<p>Bharoocha first came to my attention as the frighteningly intense drummer behind Black Dice's early singles-- and then as the tribal virtuoso who helped the band stretch out into the glorious Boredoms-esque peaks of <i>Beaches and Canyons</i>-- but often on <i>Full Bloom </i>his drumming was reduced to a pitter-pat running through the background. On <i>Shore Obsessed</i> he shows off the big, bold funk chops that were often hidden in his previous work. For a guy who fractured rhythms into a zillion jagged pieces on Black Dice's <i>Number 3</i>, it's thrilling to hear Bharoocha revel in the bubblegum joy of a Eurodisco pulse on ""Treading Water"". Reading that, of course, you might be groaning: ""Another dance-rock guy content to peddle well-worn disco beats?"" But Bharoocha's clearly done his homework. <i>Shore Obsessed</i> reveals a producer and songwriter who's listened deeply to a wide variety of dance styles, figuring out the rhythmic and melodic ideas that make them tick before trying to put his own stamp on them.</p>
<p>

You can also tell he still enjoys his left-field status-- he's unconstrained by ideas about what a genre ""should"" sound like. His background as a texture-obsessed noise artist allows him to bring in oddly perfect new sounds: Balearic beat that goes beyond late-80s synth presets (""First Time""); a raw take on ""world music""-inflected deep house (""Light Bright""); the blocky riffs of early rave and elements of Depeche Mode (""Nerve of People""); mutant kin to the current wave of 8-bit dub steppers (""Bonzer""). Bharoocha's hit the kind of sweet spot that only truly inventive outsiders manage to reach.</p></div>"|14912.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14912-shore-obsessed/|7.0|Jess Harvell

When we first heard Robyn sing those words, on a single promoting what would become a three-volume set of mini-LPs all bearing the name <i>Body Talk</i>, it was easy to focus on the Swedish pop singer's quirky sense of humor. But on this new full-length edition, ""Fembot"" also reveals itself as a compelling statement of purpose. Playing off contemporary pop's age-old diva-as-robot trope and cautioning that fellow droids who ""burn out"" are ""ready for demolition,"" Robyn is a pop star who first and foremost projects a need for emotional connection.</p>
<p>If that's Robyn's artistic credo, then <i>Body Talk</i> is living, breathing, cybernetic proof. Melding dancehall with bubblegum pop, heartbroken  love songs with hilariously catty weirdness, and euphorically catchy  melodies with propulsive rhythms, <i>Body Talk</i>-- which combines the five-song <i>Body Talk Pt. 3</i> with, outside ofÂ <i>Pt. 1</i>'s uncommonly wise ""Cry When You Get Older"", the highlightsÂ from the first two mini-albums--Â is a deeply affecting pop  record. Robyn may not have released three full albums this  year as first implied, but her first true full-length in five years is one of the year's best.</p>
<p>What sets Robyn apart from her contemporaries is the three-dimensional complexity of her character, and all sides are on display here. There's plenty of don't-fuck-with-me attitude in the icy electro-throb of ""Don't Fucking Tell Me What to Do"", which introduces a shit-talking heroine who may be flawed but won't be anyone's pawn. And with production by Diplo, the mock-outrageous Jamaica homage ""Dancehall Queen"" proves she's not kidding. But she's also sensitive enough that, during one of <i>Body Talk</i>'s most inspired moments-- the soaringly tuneful electro-pop ballad ""Call Your Girlfriend""-- she tells her boyfriend exactly how to break it off with the other woman to inflict the least emotional damage.</p>
<p>However, the highlight from this Year of Robyn remains the gorgeous ""Dancing on My Own"". What's especially remarkable is that there was any room for improvement: The track appears here as an amped-up ""radio remix"" with bonus synths giving the lovelorn chorus an extra wallop. But then again, Robyn is a master of re-invention: ""Indestructible"" and ""Hang With Me"" were first released as emotive acoustic ballads, and later given revved-up Eurodisco overhauls that ramped up the intensity without sacrificing an ounce of their bittersweet charm. Those are the versions included here, and both lend further ammunition to <i>Body Talk</i>'s already military-grade stockpile.</p>
<p>Robyn's willingness to experiment with album conventions may feel like an ingenious gimmick, but there's no artifice to the desire for human connection that underlies her vocal quiver and party-starting kickdrums. She communicates heartbreak so convincingly that some of her most devoted fans actually wonder online about her presumed loneliness.Â She also attacks the charts from the fringes. She explores the fringes from the charts. She should be universal. So why isn't she?<b> </b>With <i>Body Talk</i>, Robyn ups the ante for pop stars across the radio dial and raises her own chances of appearing on yours. And for all her three-album talk, she never forgets that cardinal rule of showmanship: Always leave them wanting more.</p></div>"|14917.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14917-body-talk/|8.7|Marc Hogan

Slug quotes Lifter Puller and Kool G Rap with equal conviction, Fog's Andrew Broder turns turntablism into a vital component of avant rock, and P.O.S fronts a hardcore band, Building Better Bombs, that shares a good-sized fanbase overlap with his b-boy followers. So it shouldn't be a huge surprise that one of Minnesota's most prominent young hip-hop producers has a simultaneous footing in the indie rock world. Aaron Mader was a guitarist/vocalist/songwriter with the smartly Fugazi-indebted Plastic Constellations until their indefinite 2008 hiatus, but as Lazerbeak he's also produced much of the Doomtree crew's best material, including some of the hookiest, hardest-hitting tracks on P.O.S'Â <i>Never Better</i>.</p>
<p>If you think there's some sort of potential contradiction in that career path, his solo debut,Â <i>Legend Recognize Legend</i>, might confuse you before it converts you. That's because Lazerbeak's first full-length draws out a third facet to his style: its pop-song structure and its sample-based construction build an odd-angled, raspy-voiced take on indie pop that doesn't shred or bang as much as it kind of twinkles. It's a bit twee without being all that cloying about it: A synthesis of harps, flutes, acoustic guitars, and chimes flutter over brisk basslines and drums that still have some suppleness in their spines, and all these elements are combined in a way that actually has some groove to it. Where some artists try to approach R&amp;B from a grounding in indie pop, Lazerbeak appears to be taking the opposite route, and even the lightest, most subdued moments here (""Let It Go""; ""Pearly Gates"") have some real rhythmic snap behind them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, dude's too savvy to go Owl City on us-- for one thing, he can actually write lyrics that don't hemorrhage treacle when you pull them apart. Lazerbeak infuses <i>Legend Recognize Legend </i>with a fair amount of North Woods conceptualism that, in its most Minnesotan trait, depicts nature-- and the things it represents, human behavior included-- as something that can turn on you without remorse. There are mentions of the urge to break the claustrophobia of stifling winters (""Cannon Falls""), the difficulty of escaping undertows alone (""Salt and Sea""), and the feeling of being knocked around by forces out of your control (""Tempest""). And this is all delivered in a voice that sounds raw, ragged, frostbitten, and battered, a love-it-or-hate-it rasp that drags its flatness across simple melodies through what sounds like kicking-and-screaming force.</p>
<p>The voice and the tunes don't always match-- the sparser the production, the more intrusive that rasp feels-- but sometimes that dissonance between the rough-edged singing and the fine-hewn production provides a compelling pop thrill, like the resilient, dramatic swells of ""Salt and Sea"" or the mournful intensity in ""Bound"". Disappointed hip-hop fiends might want to find more accommodating solace elsewhere-- for them, I suggest Doomtree cohort Paper Tiger's fine <i>Made Like Us</i>--Â but if you're interested in finding out just what a scene without borders is capable of coming up with, <i>Legend Recognize Legend </i>is worth the initial disorientation.</p></div>"|14911.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14911-legend-recognize-legend/|7.2|Nate Patrin

When Spinner asked the Philadelphia pair to name their vices earlier this year, Everton drew a blank: ""I'm sure if I thought long enough I could come up with something."" Garcia confessed that he's usually too exhausted from his day job as a green engineer to dabble in the devil's work. Not surprising for a couple of avowed health-food nuts and dedicated home recorders. Fortunately their sophomore album, <i>Prism Eyes</i> (following 2009's <i>Mystical Participation</i>), doesn't suffer from its conspicuous absence of rock'n'roll excess.</p>
<p><i>Prism Eyes</i> works within many of the garage-punk tropes championed by Best Coast, Wavves, Dum Dum Girls, and others: hollow-bucket beats, screw-loose guitar rattle, and canyons of reverb. Primitive playing serves runaway trains like ""Underground"" well. In the song's exhilarating one-minute-and-change span, the band locates maybe two chords on the fretboard and stands on tippy toes reaching for vocal counterparts. Musical virtuosos they aren't. But Everton and Garcia have a tight grip on what makes indie pop tick-- sincerity, enthusiasm, and a catchy chorus. The duo alternates between plain unison singing and scrappy, handmade harmonies, which suggests a larger cast of characters and gives the songs a communal ""all together now"" vibe-- kind of like the group-hug feeling of a <i>Glee</i> finale, sans choreography and teen divas.</p>
<p>Hazy, undefined nostalgia is Reading Rainbow's stock-in-trade. And when Everton and Garcia work with rose-colored 1960s pop sounds and feisty punk 'tude, the results are wonderful. Not so when they capitulate to the false imperative to write slow, ballady songs in a vaguely 50s prom mode (what, for the sake of historical diversity?). Soggy duet ""Let's Dream Tonight"" never rises above formal exercise, because it lacks the emotional conviction of the album's brighter, uptempo numbers. But that's a relatively minor demerit, and <i>Prism Eyes</i>' winners far outnumber its skip tracks. Maybe it's the season, or maybe I've grown weary of a musical landscape scorched by twitchy dubstep, witchhouse drones, icy synths, and apocalyptic visions, but comfort and joy sounds awfully appealing right now.</p></div>"|14905.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14905-prism-eyes/|7.7|Amy Granzin

It instead exposes the raw components of his odd career, an improbable, colorful circuit board resembling the wiring to some Rube Goldberg device.</p>
<p>A musical prodigy from a Canadian mining town, Haack was all-encompassing in his approach. He had composed far-out children's music and pop songs, experimented with classical/synthesizer hybrids, and hand-crafted a studio's worth of electronic instruments (including a proto-vocoder, Farad, named after inventor Michael Faraday) by the end of the 60s. Few can claim to have demoed electronic instruments for Fred Rogers and written a song covered by Beck (""Funky Little Song"", not included on this album). But his scattered biography goes a long way toward explaining the playful weirdness and the philosophical underpinnings that made Haack so refreshing. Even on his psychedelic excursions or the stone cold electro funk of ""Stand Up Lazarus"", there's a sense of wonder and play, and he doesn't stay perpetually plugged-in, letting folk and country twang find its way into his music.</p>
<p>The tone of his tracks veered from suspended, bubbly escapes (""Rain of Earth"") and silly sing-alongs (""Maybe This Song"") to a Kraftwerk-worthy electro jam with a pre-Def Jam Russell Simmons (1982's ""Party Machine"") or the Byrds-like tinge of ""National Anthem to the Moon"", one of a handful of tracks on the comp taken from his 1970 album <i>The Electric Lucifer.</i> Haack took to the vocoder like Jim Henson took to felt, imitating a guttural monster on ""Noon Day Sun"" and bending his voice into that of a cheesy lovelorn cyborg on ""Rita"". On the jaunty, ""Electric to Me Turn"", Haack gets philosophical over steam organ synths, declaring, ""Electric to me turn this night/ Reflecting universal light/ All I knew that should be true/ Is reality in you."" Hindsight may render some of these tracks a bit silly or indulgent, but this patchwork of music showcases a true believer and a talent that deserves recognition among his early synthesizer peers.</p></div>"|14918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14918-farad-the-electric-voice/|7.1|Patrick Sisson

Half-Handed Cloud ringleader John Ringhofer has gone about it in the smartest way possible, aligning with artists unafraid to express their spirituality, like Sufjan Stevens (Ringhofer is a long-time member of the Illinoisemakers) and Daniel Smith of Danielson, who helped mix this album, Half-Handed Cloud's fifth full-length. Here, amidst the short, choppy tunes, Ringhofer is even more forthcoming in his concept, assembling an album ""where water serves as a surrogate body for God."" But Ringhofer's anxious, exhaustive approach makes <i>As Stowaways</i> a hard sell.</p>
<p>The music shifts, starts, stops, and shifts again in uncomfortable ways. By packing each minute with a mess of hairpin turns and giddy rhythmic fluctuations, he's made it difficult to form any sort of emotional connection with the material here. By the time you've spent 10 minutes with the album, you feel like you are overdue for a breather. That said, Ringhofer clearly knows what he's doing and has a specific effect in mind. The songs are able to turn on a dime and are crafted with great attention to detail. And the excitement in their creation is palpable. Sometimes, the songs have an appeal reminiscent of a hyper-caffeinated Shins, with the addition of a refined sense of quirkiness that evokes a Mark Mothersbaugh score for a Wes Anderson movie. And the introduction of sweet but fleeting patches of string and horn work is welcome, especially as a respite from Ringhofer's zigzagging songs.</p>
<p>But while it's clear that a lot of love went into <i>As Stowaways</i>, it's ultimately hard to keep up. The songs are jarring and all over the place, which is a real problem, but the focus is lost in other ways, too. Ringhofer often delivers these anecdotes and thoughts in an irritatingly cheeky manner that makes it hard to form any spiritual or emotional connection, and his pinched voice is an acquired taste, to put it mildly. For such a hyperactive record, <i>As Stowaways</i> weirdly becomes a rather passive listening experience, difficult to penetrate beyond its busy surface.</p></div>"|14894.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14894-as-stowaways-in-cabinets-of-surf-we-live-out-in-our-members-a-kind-of-rebirth/|5.2|Zach Kelly

Go back to last year's bloated, all-star sophomore slump <i>Temporary Pleasure</i>, and you're confronted by a production team that sounded like they were squandering their indie-dance crossover cred, scraping together a pop-skewing record that tried to please everybody and disappointed half of them. So what do they do for a follow-up? An album of tech-house instrumentals based around slow builds, minimal melodies, and wide-open, between-beat negative spaces that sounds almost completely alienating outside a dancefloor context-- as well as a second disc of the tracks mixed together. And every song is named after an exotic gastronomical oddity, at least one of which has made Gordon Ramsay throw up. So much for compromise.</p>
<p>That titular premise of <i>Delicacies </i>is by design: The intent was to produce songs that, like the bizarre foodstuffs they were named after, appeal only to a select few with adventurous palates. The main idea at play here seems to be the way they approach the buildup, the moment in dance music that crests to something approaching euphoria-- only in this case, they replace that high with something more evocative of anxiety and dread. The longest track is a near 10-minute controlled spasm of palpitating kicks, itchy snares, rusty bass, and hissing swells; not for nothing is it titled ""Nerve Salad"". Most of the album follows that uneasy path, playing up the sparseness and austerity of the drum sounds and the low end so that any appearance by a non-percussive element feels a bit like uncomfortable jolts. Not that there are a lot of non-percussive elements to start-- melodic hooks, or what pass for them, splinter off into deliberate rhythmic counterpoints or beat-accenting stings more than they actually provide an easy riff to cling to.</p>
<p>And even if some of <i>Delicacies </i>starts to sound a bit samey to ears more attuned to the less minimalistic strains of house, the distinct moments have character to spare. ""HÃ¡karl"", named after the fermented shark dish that defeated Ramsay's gag reflex, sweats out an acid-inflected strain of suspenseful, quick-stepping techno that evokes a sort of nauseous tension, especially during the jaw-clenching drone that seizes the track up at the midway point. Leadoff track ""Aspic"" is maybe the most immediately danceable, shuddering through a deliriously twitchy future funk reminiscent of Juan Atkins' classic Model 500 track ""Off to Battle"". And ""Ortolan"", named after a bird prepared, served, and eaten bones-and-all, stirs up a dueling pair of basslines and lets a synthesized chime tone sink deep into them, congealing into a halfway-Krautrock groove that provides one of the album's few moments of lightness.</p>
<p>Most of <i>Delicacies </i>is collected from a series of singles that debuted on SMD's label of the same name, a sort of field-test project where they'd assemble a track with a limited, self-imposed deadline and a quick turnaround time, then drop it on club crowds to gauge the reception. That they succeeded on these terms says something about how easily they threw themselves into such an adventurous idea. And if the results aren't necessarily the kind of up-front and accessible electro that would appeal to their ""Hustler""-adoring base, it's definitely an interesting shot at regrouping and concocting a few rapidly refined ideas.</p></div>"|14896.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14896-delicacies/|7.4|Nate Patrin

There's nothing about how the band formed, where or how they recorded, or when they tour; instead the entry rounds up the members' current projects. This curiously cursory timeline implies-- in retrospect at least-- that Carissa's Wierd was defunct even before the members played their first notes together back in 1995. And while it took them eight years and a handful of releases before they actually went their separate ways, their bittersweet-- well, mostly bitter-- songs about leaving always hinted at that inevitable end. A sense of insoluble disconnect is reflected in the band's sprawling song structures, in the tension of the plodding drumbeats, in the pinpricks of guitar, and especially in the asymmetry of Mat Brooke's and Jenn Ghetto's overlapping vocals, which resemble a Robert Altman script set to music.</p>
<p>Now, seven years after that final performance, the band sounds best as an obscurity, one of too many Pac NW groups that had a good run to nowhere and made its biggest impact when its members moved on to other projects. Thanks to offshoots like Band of Horses, Grand Archives, S, and Sera Cahoone solo, as well as to the efforts of Seattle's Hardly Art Records, Carissa's Wierd has grown slightly more popular in recent years. Following the career-spanning comp <i>They'll Only Miss You When You Leave: Songs 1996-2003</i> earlier this year, the label is reissuing three of the band's long players on vinyl and digital (skipping CD altogether), lending the band minor retrospective relevance. This rearview-mirror treatment, unsurprisingly, suits the music exceptionally well, as it adds even more gravity to their guarded, emotionally scoured mopefolk. That there are no bonus tracks on any of these reissues actually makes good sense: At this point, pretty much every Carissa's Wierd song plays like a rarity.</p>
<p>Aptly, Carissa's Wierd's first LP was itself a retrospective: <i>Ugly But Honest</i> collects songs from 1996 through 1999, and either by luck or by design, the collection has a clear thematic throughline, which links all these skewed songs into the band's best and boldest statement. Here, the members introduce the elements that would define Carissa's Wierd. The album possesses the shambolic vibe of 90s indie, but the compositional sprawl suggests Built to Spill, while the post-rock abstractions recall Godspeed You! Black Emperor. But these early songs reveal just how immediately and naturally they settled into a unique sound-- <i>Ugly But Honest</i> sounds less a debut by a young band and more like the work of seasoned professionals with too many shows at too many half-filled venues under its belt. ""One Night Stand"" opens with a weightless melody and subtle vocal flourishes from Ghetto, then breaks down self-destructively, as if the band set fire to the tapes as they were recording. It's an odd resolution to the song, suggesting not only an ambition to be more than simply sad-bastard background music but also a compelling desire to deflect emotions too troubling to convey directly.</p>
<p>After such a strong statement on their debut, <i>You Should Be at Home Here</i>, from 2001, sounds tame, a bit too polished and perfected. It's their first proper studio album, and the setting allows them to indulge new ideas without venturing too far from the parameters of <i>Ugly. </i>The sudden, unexpected climax of ""The Color That Your Eyes Changed with the Color of Your Hair"" magnifies minor details of a relationship to majestic purposes, as Brooke and Ghetto trade off vocals so it's impossible to tell who is singing lead. That moment aside, these songs remain mostly muted and restrained, which makes the album a bit tedious. Flipping over the vinyl to get to side two provides a welcome break.</p>
<p><i>Songs About Leaving</i>, from 2002, sounds fascinatingly hesitant, as if by then the band were barely holding together. Recorded with Chris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie, the album simultaneously showcases their full-band sound on ""September Come Take This Heart Away"" and ""They'll Only Miss You When You Leave"" while isolating the instruments slightly, as if to reinforce the loneliest aspects of every part. In general, Bridwell's drums are absent over long passages, but instead of emphasizing the repetitive quality that nearly sunk the previously album, it generates more tension and fragile despair on ""A New Holiday (November 16th)"" and ""The Piano Song"". At times these songs sound more like demos than finished products, which is apt. On ""So You Wanna Be a Superhero"", the overlapping, mismatched guitar licks provide a bed of briars for Ghetto's wounded vocals: ""I might be leaving soon,"" she sings, a statement that grows more ominous with each repetition. <i>Songs About Leaving</i> is all the more devastating for being the band's final act.</p>
<p>Together, these three albums tell a story of arrival, tentative variation, and inevitable collapse, but perhaps what's most remarkable is that you don't need to know the band's history to distinguish that narrative arc. In fact, listening to this loose trilogy makes their 2003 break-up, which came on the heels of a cross-country tour that both exhausted the band and established some early success outside the Pacific Northwest, sound like an act of conviction and commitment.

On ""So You Wanna Be a Superhero"", the overlapping, mismatched guitar licks provide a bed of briars for Ghetto's wounded vocals: ""I might be leaving soon,"" she sings, a statement that grows more ominous with each repetition. <i>Songs About Leaving</i> is all the more devastating for being the band's final act.</p>
<p>Together, these three albums tell a story of arrival, tentative variation, and inevitable collapse, but perhaps what's most remarkable is that you don't need to know the band's history to distinguish that narrative arc. In fact, listening to this loose trilogy makes their 2003 break-up, which came on the heels of a cross-country tour that both exhausted the band and established some early success outside the Pacific Northwest, sound like an act of conviction and commitment. In that stalwartness there is a sense of finality: Where could they possibly go from here except on to other things? The end of Carissa's Wierd was truly its beginning.</p></div>"|14915.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14915-ugly-but-honest-you-should-be-at-home-here-songs-about-leaving/|8.0|Stephen M. Deusner

His most recent position had been a Vice-Governorship of the city of Kinshasa, the capital of his homeland, the Democratic Republic of Congo. Before that he served in the country's transitional parliament and the cabinet of President Laurent Kabila. His public life had begun decades earlier, though, in the 1950s, when he made his singing debut with Rock-A-Mambo, one of the great early Congolese rumba bands. At the time, Congo was still the Belgian Congo, and the rumba music that would become one of its greatest cultural gifts to the world was still coming into its own. Tabou, better known by his school nickname Rochereau, joined the band of Joseph Kabasele, and it was in this band that he cultivated the star power that allowed him to strike out on his own in the mid-60s.</p>
<p>This period was well documented on Sterns' excellent 2xCD <i>The Voice of Lightness 1961-1977</i> compilation three years ago. That set brought the story up to 1977 and cataloged Rochereau's many shifts in direction as he honed his band, Orchestre Afrisa International, and consolidated his position as one of the masters of Congolese music. By 1977, his only real competitor for the title was the great guitarist and leader of OK Jazz, Franco. Vol. 2 of <i>The Voice of Lightness</i> picks up where the last one left off, right after Rochereau's triumphant appearance as the leader of an all-star Congolese band at the World Black and African Festival of Arts &amp; Culture in Lagos, Nigeria. The band he led at FESTAC '77 appears on the first track here, sounding confident and laid back and maybe even a little old-fashioned playing an airy brand of rumba that was at the time being eclipsed by the faster soukous of Zaiko Langa Langa and other relatively young bands.</p>
<p>Rochereau's own band, Afrisa, enters to stay on the second track, though, and throughout the set, they demonstrate a clear mastery of the new, driving pulse the music had taken on, even as the members come and go. Occasionally, Rochereau even addresses the turnover, as he does on ""Ponce Pilate"", where he dryly chastises his defecting band members, singing in Lingal
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
a, ""We're shocked when we see someone injure someone else/ But we laugh when someone injures himself."" Later, on ""Sarah"", he addresses turnover in his personal life, lashing out at his second wife after she divorced him while he was on tour in North America: ""How does a man come to despise the woman he once loved?"" It should be noted that Rochereau wasn't exactly treading on stable ground here-- he was never a one-woman man, and when I say second wife, I mean she was his second wife <i>at the time</i>. Rochereau was a practicing polygamist.</p>
<p>Even when he sang his most bile-filled lines, though, Rochereau's voice remained a light, supple instrument. He had a way of floating through an arrangement without getting a bit of the dust kicked up by the rolling guitars and insistently pulsing percussion on himself. When he's joined by his chorus, which on many of these tracks includes his lover/protege Mbilia Bel, their voices blend sweetly, contrasting sharply with the blasting horn section, led by Rochereau's longtime right-hand man Modero Mekanisi. This period found Rochereau's songs stretching out to accommodate long instrumental passages for dancing, and the tracks on this compilation average somewhere around nine or 10 minutes, giving the various guitarists Rochereau works with plenty of time to stretch their legs and solo.</p>
<p>Two of the greatest Congolese guitarists ever make appearances here. Rochereau had a falling out with Docteur Nico in the late 60s, when the two split from each other to form competing bands, but ""Ohambe"" finds them working brilliantly together once again-- when Rochereau cries out ""Nico, speak!"" Nico obliges with a shimmering, gorgeous solo. The occasion of Joseph Kabasele's death in 1983 brought Rochereau together with his greatest rival, Franco, for ""Kabasele in Memoriam"", which is a highlight in the careers of both men. Rochereau sings beautifully, sometimes in harmony with his old rival, and Franco offers a showcase on both acoustic and electric guitar. Franco was taken by the AIDS epidemic in 1989, and it would have been a shame had the two never recorded together.</p>
<p>As the second disc wears on, a few things become clear: The music was changing around Rochereau, and he had to change with it. This set avoids his Paris studio work with drum machines and synthesizers attempting to stand in for horns, but it still hints at that work in the synths that occasionally drop in for a squiggly solo. More importantly, though, Rochereau spent much of the time covered on the disc living essentially in exile, first in Europe and then in the United States. To his great credit, the singer managed throughout his career to keep more distance between himself and dictator Mobutu Sese Seko than many of his peers, and when living in exile in Paris, he recorded some of his most openly critical songs. The punning title of ""Exil-Ley"" belies a much more serious message-- the song is Rochereau plainly lamenting his nation's descent into graft and economic collapse. ""Le Glas a Sonne"", also recorded in 1993, directly indicts Mobutu's increasingly ruinous regime, listing off the great men of Congo and leaving Mobutu out, in effect likening him to the white colonial rulers the country had thrown out decades before.</p>
<p>Rocehreau's musical career largely petered out during the 90s when he lived in the U.S. As his attentions were drawn more and more to the politics and needs of his homeland. When Mobutu fell in 1997, he went back home to serve in the new government. Even so, his cultural legacy seems likely to loom high over his political legacy when the historical record settles. This compilation and its previous volume are the absolute best place for Westerners to begin exploring that legacy. They're by no means a definitive catalog-- this is, after all, a man who released four or five albums a year during the period covered on this comp-- but they gather much of his best work in one easy-to-digest set, and everyone needs a starting place. With its crisp sound, informative notes and impeccable track selection, this is the intro the great artist deserves.</p></div>"|14907.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14907-the-voice-of-lightness-vol-2/|8.0|Joe Tangari

The song's mantra about being real is effervescent, an instigation to dance amplified by a combination of airy synths, pseudo-rave bullhorns, and precocious rhythms. The clichÃ©d, pure-positive-thinking lyrics aren't as important as the sheer motivational energy captured in the songs. Vocalist Michael Bell-Smith apparently won't settle for any crossed arms or polite head-nods.</p>
<p>The aptly titled <i>Restless People</i> leans heavily on that same amped-up positivity for the duration of its short, 27-minute runtime. An amalgam of members of Tanlines and a few bandmates from Jesse Cohen's other gig, Professor Murder, the group creates a celebratory, synth-heavy blend of world beat sounds, a fusion that brings together the perkier elements of its composite parts. The band has also mentioned groups like Gorilla Biscuits and Operation Ivy as influences, which aren't the outliers they may appear to be-- check out the shout-along section of ""Victimless Crime""-- and put the album's attitude and rapid-fire bursts of energy into perspective. Such a charging-ahead vibe needs plenty of cathartic moments.</p>
<p>Synthetic tribal percussion and horns underlie lyrical musings about changing perspectives on ""Little Sky"", a swirling mid-album high point that recalls the Peter Gabriel influence of contemporaries Yeasayer. ""Practical Magic"" and ""Practical Magic II"", back-to-back songs animated by stomping, crisp rhythms, rubbery bass, and an early-90s dance breakdown, build to the big ending on closer ""Victimless Crime"".</p>
<p>Restless People never sound rudderless, but even during such a brief album, they sound like they're treading (or bouncing) over the same ground a little bit. The template doesn't vary too much, and the lyrics, while just as energizing as any other instrument on the record, don't have quite the depth they could. High-energy dance music doesn't require any excuse or explanation, and <i>Restless People </i>rarely provides one.</p></div>"|14889.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14889-restless-people/|6.3|Patrick Sisson

But <i>Fifteen</i>, the debut from the Melbourne duo, dispenses with all notions of not-so-willful amateurishness, shaky playing, and half-there hooks. Instead, it offers a dozen sing-songy bashers, blasted out with a confidence well beyond their years. With melody to spare and an enviable amount of restraint, Super Wild Horses make <i>Fifteen</i> sound less like the work of a couple of newbies, and more like a pair of old pros who've learned enough to figure out what they can get away with forgetting.</p>
<p><i>Fifteen</i> swings from a punkish thwack to a garage-rock strut, but it's got the feel of a scuzzy alt-rock record, with loose-fitting hooks and craggy guitars. McKee and Franz have a kind of multiplying effect when they start smearing their voices atop each other. The diffuse buzz of the music combined with their push-and-pull on the mic can at times feel so familiar, it's almost familial: Super Wild Horses can and do play like a spinier, far less stoney version of the last couple of Breeders LPs. There's an uncanny beauty that comes when they lock their voices in sync that brings to mind the Deal sisters. And like the Breeders in the last decade, they keep the hooks back, and melodies arrive at intersections rather than announcing themselves out front. Vocal similarities aside, both bands take offhandedness to new heights.</p>
<p><i>Fifteen</i>'s first half is its hookiest. ""Lock &amp; Key"" knocks in the door, but the title track swings roughly, ""Mess Around"" threatens convincingly, and ""Adrian"" pleads with palpable longing. The exuberant vocal back-and-forth has kind of a schoolyard charm to it, but lyrically, they cut some standard teenage themes-- unrequited crushes, small-town escapism-- with a refreshingly flip attitude. And for all their pining, they're not afraid to get weird or abstract or downright blasphemous when the mood strikes. For every diaristic ""is he really going out with her?"" bit, there are a couple more slices of this goofy indignation that suggests a couple of very funny, subversive minds at work. The album reads more like the margins of a notebook-- stray thoughts, decent jokes, the kind of stuff you half-hope somebody sneaks a glance at.</p>
<p>Just short of the halfway mark, <i>Fifteen</i>'s punchier, more garage-indebted side gives way to an alt-rock haze. The garagey stuff's more fun, but these are impressive songs-- impressionistic and a bit lopsided, they manage to make two voices, one drumkit, one guitar, a touch of keyboard, and a stompbox sound like a lot more people doing a lot more work. Things seem to crash into each other just so, leaving shards of melody everywhere. One simply doesn't arrive at such a sound by accident. In 26 short minutes, <i>Fifteen</i> gets a lot done, and has a hell of a time doing it. They may not have been at it for long, but they're already leaving peers in the dust.</p></div>"|14901.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14901-fifteen/|7.6|Paul Thompson

But judging by the <i>Dagger Paths</i> EP, released by Olde English Spelling Bee earlier this year, the results are richer than you might expect. Through dense, mesmerizing atmospheres, which conjure faded memories and dream states, Barnes manages to evoke techno, dub, drone, and even hip-hop and R&amp;B.</p>
<p>In fact, when I <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14397-dagger-paths/"">wrote</a> about the EP back in June, I had a little trouble seeing Barnes' work outside of the fog of buzzy micro-genres like chillwave and witch house. His music's ghostly aura connects to those and other leftfield trends, but really, Barnes has pretty much transcended them all. The more I've listened, the more I've found his hypnotic concoctions to be in a category of their own. Now that UK label No Pain in Pop has re-releasedÂ <i>Dagger Paths</i>, adding two tracks from a recent 7"" and a CD-R with an impressive array of bonus material, the singularity is so clear it's almost blinding.</p>
<p>Most of that bright light comes from the surprisingly integral role of guitar. At first, these songs sound like a slow, sleepy weave of disparate elements-- dubby bass, sparse percussion, distant voices, blurry samples. But eventually, a bold guitar figure crafts a melody that sticks in your head rather than drifting away with all the echo and atmosphere. Barnes' music can rightly be called murky and dream-like, but it's deceptively so. <i>Dagger Paths</i> is much more active and sharp than such descriptions might imply.</p>
<p>The result is that, the further you delve these songs, the catchier each becomes. A few are immediately engaging, like the swinging ""Miarches"" and hip-hop-in-slo-mo ""The Light""
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>

. But other tracks prove just as memorable once they have some time to burrow into your brain. On ""Glory Gongs"", winding guitar chimes return whenever the track threatens to fall apart. And even the reverb-heavy, negative-space cover of Aaliyah's ""If Your Girl Only Knew"" retains the hook of the original. That trend persists as Barnes shifts his sound on two newer tracks-- the sparse, reggae-inflected ""Rattling Cage"", and ""Hjurt"", which wraps guitar in bombed-out drums and distant cries.</p>
<p>No Pain in Pop's bonus CD-R starts with six early Forest Swords tracks, all of which show Barnes' methods to have been pretty well intact from the start (a few are so heavy on fuzzed-out guitar explorations that Forest Swords could be mistaken for an improv rock combo). Also added are remixes of <i>Dagger Paths</i> cuts by other artists, and a 20-minute mix in which Barnes inventively reworks These New Puritans, Burial/Four Tet, and Wild Beasts. Clearly the guy has wide ideas about sound and what it can do, but what impresses most about <i>Dagger Paths </i>is its focus. All the elements and styles that Barnes collects like a magnet quickly align toward one unmistakable musical vision.</p></div>"|14903.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14903-dagger-paths-expanded-edition/|8.4|Marc Masters

When she first started releasing tapes in the late 1990s, she was part of a Berlin scene named <i>Wohnzimmer</i> music, meaning ""living room,"" because the living room is where they played shows. And though she's worked with Thomas Fehlmann and Pole, whose ties to pop forms are theoretical at best, Morgenstern never capitulated to real techno-- even when her songs run long, they're still songs. But her music was also never as friendly as her peers', most of whom are basically turning into footnotes in the Postal Service's bio-- by comparison, Morgenstern sounds reluctant, evasive, never cute enough to cuddle. That she never got the attention she deserved makes sense-- it feels like she never really asked for it.</p>
<p>So while other artists might take a greatest-hits occasion to pile on the makeup and make a case for canonization, <i>Fan No. 2</i>-- which serves as both an early-works compilation and a greatest hits-- is as understated as any of Morgenstern's albums. Despite having six full-lengths and a few EPs to draw on, the greatest-hits portion of this 2CD set has three new tracks, including a cover of the Beatles' ""Blackbird"" (which, in a gesture that proves Morgenstern is more interested in art than idol worship, turns Paul McCartney's folksy schmaltz into club-pop). ""The Operator"", her poppiest track-- the best evidence she could've been better-known if she decided that's what she wanted-- is featured as a ""piano"" version, without the blippy little drum machine that made the original usable on the dancefloor. ""Der Augenblick"" shows up as a previously unreleased remix. ""Das Wort"" was taken from an obscure EP. These are the kinds of choices that'd feel frustrating or self-deprecating in the context of other artists, but with Morgenstern they're expected-- the same kinds of choices that have made her career consistently interesting.</p>
<p>The second disc here collects two early EPs, 1997s <i>Enter the Partyzone</i> and <i>Plastikreport</i>, previously released only on cassette. Lo-fi, minor-key, and lead mostly with cheap-sounding keyboards, they're like a less severe and more tousled version of Young Marble Giants-- the kind of music whose smallness lends it a paradoxical strength and resilience. They're not nearly as sophisticated as the sly, spacious sound she arrived at on 2003's <i>Nichts Muss</i> (my favorite album by her), but they're pretty great examples of her unusual instinct for harmony and melody-- on songs that are mostly between two and three minutes long, it's hard to figure out how she takes all the turns she does without making a mess. Compositionally, she lives at some imagined intersection of 60s spy-movie soundtracks, lounge, and cabaret, the plaintive, mashed-potato familiarity of Anglo indie-rock, and the computerized Euro-folk of Kraftwerk. Like all of her songs, up through ""The Operator"" and the new ones included on the greatest-hits disc, they feel like they're partially obscured or have their back turned-- they're all curve balls.</p>
<p>It's not that Morgenstern's music is alienating or that a listener would have to be that patient to hear what she has to offer, it's that what she has to offer is licorice or a lemon square-- a lot of people just aren't going to like it. Still, the difference between her and other electro-pop artists that nobody namechecks anymore is that she's the <i>only</i> artist who can offer what she offers. At this point, the synthification of indie rock is so familiar to listeners that it's invisible-- it's worth bringing up only if we're talking about historical trajectory. Albums that might've sounded groundbreaking in 2001 or 2002 sound quaint now, or like the building blocks of something better. Barbara Morgenstern never really broke a lot of new ground-- ironically, it's a big part of what makes <i>Fan No. 2 </i>sound interesting today.</p></div>"|14904.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14904-fan-no-2/|7.9|Mike Powell

His status, his profile, and his output all coincided with a late-aughts surge in this new universal club music concept, fusing the commonalities of Southern bounce, classic house, nu-electro, old-school pre-sampling hip-hop, and West Coast g-funk into an all-encompassing new urban dance music. And his patronage of that scene defined it flatteringly-- if you want to remember the late 00s fondly for some reason yet to be understood, A-Trak's first <i>Dirty South Dance </i>and his mix <i>Infinity +1</i> should be enough to make you believe the end of the decade was actually great.</p>
<p>So why does <i>Fool's Gold, Vol. 1, </i>a state-of-the-label comp showcasing the imprint he started with like-minded DJ Nick Catchdubs, feel like a debilitating hangover? As solid as the label's been in its three-plus years of releases, too much of this collection of recent material feels weirdly retrograde and a bit crass, a mushy assemblage of the obvious that feels a lot more backward-looking than the best the label has to offer. It might be too early to go ahead and say that electro-rap is on its way out, but if it is, the synth-pop affectations of Trackademicks' ""The Best Stroke"" and Kid Sister's warmed-over jerk slog ""Don't Stop Movin'"" are hollow epitaphs. There's also a Lil B track, ""Freeze"", that exhibits zero of whatever makes Lil B exciting; I've never heard casual gimme-head misogyny sound so bored. And if you thought CyHi da Prynce's verse on ""So Appalled"" was a work of sabotage, check out A-Trak's ""Ray Ban Vision"", an otherwise-choice piece of engagingly woozy bounce that the rapper ruins by yammering about how he fucks women with his sunglasses on.</p>
<p>Things sharpen up a bit when you get closer to standard house turf-- though you have to wade through a few throwbacks to get there. Some are cringeworthy: the synth-drums from Tears for Fears' ""Mad World"", a Stepford version of Teena Marie, and a vocoder? Try harder, Treasure Fingers featuring Haley Small. And some are crowd-pleasing: Tensnake's always good for some earnestly joyous beardo disco, and even though his remix of Vega's ""No Reasons"" feels like preservationist house Ã Â la 1995, that piano riff is a hell of a reason to consider that a good year to visit. A few tracks are a bit more forward-looking-- Flosstradamus' ""Cape Town Get Down"" and Riton's remix of Congorock's ""Babylon"" incorporate shreds of contemporary South African house and electro into their structures-- but you'll probably be more satisfied if you come in expecting slightly postmodern tweaks on familiar vintage sounds from Detroit (Jokers of the Scene's ""Power Slave"") or Chicago (LA Riots' ""Control Your Tuba"").</p>
<p>Fool's Gold has put out some quality stuff lately-- just this year, we got style-hybridizing advancements like Kingdom's blistering garage/electro crossover ""Mind Reader"", the superior original mix of Congorock's ""Babylon"" firing a 21-laser salute at UK funky, and the manic, equatorial house of Greenmoney's <i>Gold Ru$h </i>EP. That's more than enough to give you a sense of what this label's really capable of, and it feels like a more tenable direction than the nostalgic, somewhat ossified vision of dance music laid out in <i>Vol. 1.</i> File this under When Bad Comps Happen to Good Labels, and keep your fingers crossed.</p></div>"|14888.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14888-fools-gold-vol-1/|5.6|Nate Patrin

The clarinet-violin-piano trio is relatively rare and modern by comparison, probably because of its potential to sound unbalanced without the low-end anchor of the cello. BartÃ³k, Stravinsky, and Ives all tried their hands at it, and it's really picked up steam over the last few decades, during which the Verdehr Trio has commissioned hundreds of new works for it. Victoire, a quintet from Brooklyn, puts a progressive spin on the clarinet-violin-piano trio by adding keyboards, double bass, light IDM-inspired electronics, and the striking compositional voice of pianist Missy Mazzoli. In one fell swoop, the ensemble bypasses the low-end dilemma and breaks with the existing repertoire, in search of music that gives voice to a thoroughly post-classical age.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that Victoire jettison tradition entirely. Their debut LP,Â <i>Cathedral City </i>(which expands upon material from their 2009 eMusic ""Selects"" series EP), compares favorably to a number of eminent touchstones. Philip Glass looms large over its balance of lean, taut pulses and pensive, circling melodies, which conjure feelings of hesitancy and doubt. More contemporaneously, you might hear traces of Julianna Barwick in the digitally ruffled choral vocals that crop up, though Victoire's are much crisper and drier, of a piece with their music's almost fussy personality. There's also an affinity with Nico Muhly's <i>Mothertongue</i>: Low, burly keyboards slide tectonically under nimble yet austere tunes, and quotidian vocal elements (especially the spoken numbers on ""India Whiskey"") sift around like interference. Like Muhly, Victoire evoke a vast interiority-- the composer's multi-tasked mind, rustling and preoccupied. But <i>Mothertongue</i> felt like a mind brashly spilling out, while <i>Cathedral City</i> is more introverted and intimate: an album of private fixations.</p>
<p>Victoire worry at their motifs like difficult knots but ground them in relentless cadences. Within these strict parameters, they pack in an admirable variety of technique and emotional shading, from dawning unease to distressed inspiration. ""A Song for Mick Kelly"" feels at once fretful and poised, with a violin sawing desperately against immovable electric guitar chords courtesy of the National's Bryce Dessner. ""A Door Into the Dark"" is furtive but forceful, its layered motifs pausing, lunging boldly forward, scattering. On ""I Am Coming for My Things"", violin tremolos dart around deep, even figures in the clarinet and crackling radio transmissions. The music settles down when the voices subside, implying a direct link between freedom from encroaching signals and serenity of mind. That's a timely preoccupation if ever one was-- privacy, after all, is also a relatively modern invention; one that is currently under duress. Decisively erratic and turbulently lyrical, Victoire condense moments of focused beauty and quiet conviction from the pandemic distractions of modern life.</p></div>"|14863.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14863-cathedral-city/|7.8|Brian Howe

They spent a few months playing around with instruments and arrangements in a cabin they nicknamed Magic Central, and by naming the album after that structure, they have bestowed on it a certain imaginative power, much like the Black Lodge or Gorilla Manor. The result is, aptly, a collection of decidedly eccentric folk-pop songs with dark emotional subcurrents, one that toggles between light and dark, precocious observations and dark mortal doubts. Yet, for all the sequestered familiarity of that creation narrative (which is reminiscent of Bon Iverâs career-making deep-woods sojourn) and for all its bleak intimations, Breathe Owl Breathe never sound isolated, introverted, or closed off. In fact, <i>Magic Central</i> sounds gregarious and expansive in its idiosyncrasies, which can range from charming to pushy.</p>
<p>As our guide through the peninsular wilderness and as the narrator of so many quirky story-songs, frontman Micah Middaugh possesses a rich tenor that suggests Bill Callahan singing stoned lullabies, but he sounds best when joined by AndrÃ©a Moreno-Beals, whosely ghostly vocals haunt these songs. Perhaps because she plays cello instead of guitar, and perhaps because drummer Trevor Hobbs seems to play various percussion more than kits, their sound is eclectic and sophisticated, less like strummed folk songs than soundtracks for short films. From the whispered chorus of ""Swimming"" to the 1950s-rock piano on ""House of Gold"", they create a wintry, overcast mood that permeates every moment on <i>Magic Central</i>, as if the songs were houses insufficiently insulated from the cold.</p>
<p>Even so, those miniature movies can be aggressive about their whimsy. Middaugh writes about hearts made of papier-mÃ¢chÃ© and monsters with good penmanship, even tagging ""Dragon"" with a spoken-word intro delivered in a cutesy stoner cadence. That's the low point in the album, the moment when you just wish he'd address you like an adult. But Breathe Owl Breathe do manage to wring some grim uncertainties from his folksy fairytales: Opener ""Own Stunts"" exaggerates his heartbreak with comic imagery that would make Shel Silverstein grin approvingly. And on ""Dragon"", Middaugh asks repeatedly, even doggedly: ""How do you stop loving someone?"" That's not a rhetorical question; he really needs to know. In trying to balance whimsy and gravity, Breathe Owl Breathe come across as both confident and uncertain, full of personality and slightly overbearing, which makes <i>Magic Central</i> an intriguing, often grating album.</p></div>"|14816.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14816-magic-central/|6.8|Stephen M.

It's a perfect description of the man's rap style. Curren$y is a great pure rapper, a language addict with a tricky slip-sliding delivery and an ability to keep going for minutes at a time, uninterrupted by choruses. But he's not the type to smash us over the head with his strengths. Instead, his understated punchlines sneakily find ways into your brain and stay there. And after he spent years with hometown powerhouses No Limit and Cash Money, and then on the mixtape circuit, Curren$y finally found his ideal place on the first <i>Pilot Talk</i> album, just a few months old now. Teaming almost exclusively with veteran New York producer Ski Beatz, Curren$y rapped over a luxuriously dazed bed of lava-lamp instrumentals that pulled plenty of sounds from woozy psych-rock. And on the sequel, Curren$y and Ski go even further with that central idea, pushing into sleepy, smooth funk territory that fits Curren$y's rap style perfectly.</p>
<p>My favorite Curren$y track from the past year is ""4 Hours &amp; 20 Minutes (Ride to H-Town)"", a team-up with the blowhard Houston underground fixture Killa Kyleon that hit rap blogs shortly after the release of the first <i>Pilot Talk</i>. That rumbling, bass-heavy track doesn't appear on <i>Pilot Talk II</i>, and its omission is actually a <i>good</i> thing. Both of these <i>Pilot Talk</i> full-lengths work on vibe, and ""4 Hours &amp; 20 Minutes"" would've interrupted the space-out. So instead of the classically thundering Southern rap of that song, we get a milieu that Curren$y himself describes beautifully on ""Montreux"": ""It's that 1980 Marvin Gaye, live at the Montreux/ Stars in the audience, Al Jarreau in the third row."" (That Curren$y considers Al Jarreau a star is the sort of thing that sets him apart from the rest of the rap universe circa 2010.) These aqueous beats come fleshed out with all sorts of beautifully rendered live instrumentation: horns and flutes and pianos and Fender Rhodes and slow-rolling stand-up bass and delicately winding acoustic guitars. I've yet to hear any chillwave quite this chill.</p>
<p>And tracks like these turn out to be perfect for the slick shit that Curren$y talks so well. Spitta's favorite subject is weed, naturally enough, and both the music and his effortlessly calm delivery do great work at conjuring the sticky languor of a satisfying high. But his other lyrical touchstones are classic Southern rap material: girls, cars, money. Curren$y finds artful, sidelong ways of approaching this stuff-- punchlines that can read awkwardly on paper but sound amazing the way he delivers them.</p>
<p>The first <i>Pilot Talk</i> came with some big-name guests: Snoop Dogg, Mos Def, Devin the Dude. But on the sequel, guys like that don't fit; it's all about Curren$y drawing us into his own universe. Other than a nice Raekwon verse on the album-closing remix, everyone comes from Curren$y's own camp, including a great turn from his fellow No Limit veteran, the newly relaxed Fiend. When Jay Electronica showed up on the first installment, he stole the spotlight with a rigorous monster verse. Nothing like that happens here, and the album's sustained zone-out is the better for it.</p>
<p>And though this is mostly a deep-meditative rapping exercise, we do get one song, ""Silence"", that shows that Curren$y's style could work in a pop context if he wanted it to. The song comes with a gorgeously breathy chorus from R&amp;B singer McKenzie Eddy and makes great use of a prettily still piano line. And even though the track sounds like a breakup song, Curren$y's not having any of that: ""High when I stroll, not even leaving footprints in the snow, you know?"" For this guy, anything less wouldn't make sense.</p></div>"|14906.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14906-pilot-talk-ii/|8.2|Tom Breihan

Nearly every song on </span><i>Shleep</i><span> shines in one way or another: It features a couple of his most elegant melodies in ""Was a Friend"" (co-written by his old Soft Machine bandmate Hugh Hopper) and ""Free Will and Testament"", as well as an extended paraphrase of Bob Dylan's ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"" (""Blues in Bob Minor"") and a little instrumental written by Paul Weller.

It's useful as a display of how much his solo work is of a piece, but it's also spotty and incomplete: It'd have been nice for the new edition to include 1992's </span><i>A Short Break</i><span> EP or 2002's </span><i>Airplay</i><span> EP.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Since the 70s, Wyatt has collaborated on and off with jazz outliers Michael Mantler and Carla Bley. 2003's <i>Cuckooland</i><span>-- another bird reference, another reference to exile and absence-- prominently features their daughter Karen Mantler, and features covers of three of her songs. (She also sings A.C. Jobim's ""Insensatez"", aka ""How Insensitive"", as a duet with Wyatt; he plays a ""Karenotron"" programmed with samples of her voice.) The album feels like a messier, slightly less coherent sequel to </span><i>Shleep</i><span>--there's even another sheep song, Mantler's ""Life Is Sheep""-- and the arrangements prominently involve the chintzy synth presets of which Wyatt is inexplicably fond. But his singing makes the most of his voice's cracked, sun-bleached grain, the songwriting pushes victoriously into new territory (""Lullaloop"" ingeniously reworks a sample of another one of the album's songs, ""Lullaby for Hamza""), and a solo piano version of Buddy Holly's ""Raining in My Heart"" is a welcome casual touch. </span></p>

The band is fantastic-- it includes Mongezi Feza, Fred Frith, Nick Mason, and Julie Tippetts, among other luminaries of the British jazz and art-rock scene-- and the set features all of </span><i>Rock Bottom</i><span>, a handful of favorites from Wyatt's Soft Machine days, and an extended jam on ""I'm a Believer"". Regrettably, the sound quality is indifferent, and the performances don't particularly improve on their studio equivalents. It's fun for fans, but shouldn't be anybody's first (or fifth) Wyatt album.</span></p>

Excuse the gag, at least a little, because the label shares some of the band's tendencies to offer streamlined, updated versions of classic sounds-- in this case, late-80s and early-90s house.  Its roster loads up on galloping pianos, squelchy synth patches, and hoarse-throated divas chopped into inspired repetition.   More than being just retro retreads, Permanent Vacation's roster has excellently integrated prevailing subgenres-- Balearic, space disco, italo-- into weightless, endlessly re-playable jams.</p>
<p>The mileage you get out of deciding whether a track is <i>really </i>space disco or Balearic disco will... vary, so suffice it to say that <i>Select Label Works 2</i> features, back to back, Tensnake's ""Coma Cat"" and Azari &amp; III's ""Reckless (With Your Love)"", or two of the most ubiquitous house hits in recent memory.  When they play, concerns about defining exactly what is playing will vanish.   As Permanent Vacation still thrives on vinyl, <i>SLW2</i> isn't a label primer or showcase; it's a compendium of the label's recent singles (and the iron-hot inclusion of 2010's ""Coma Cat""), most of which are seeing a CD for the first time.  The label has been ridiculously productive, with <i>Selected Label Works 2</i> marking the second two-disc comp since 2009 (the label also curated the uneven <i>If This Is House I Want My Money Back</i>).  The mix is split pretty evenly between the  about-to-explode (Azari &amp; III, John Talabot), the exploding (Tensnake) and the exploded (Sally Shapiro).</p>
<div>If <i>SLW2</i> has a defining characteristic it's the ease with which these tracks command a room. Aside from obvious crossovers like Four Tet and Pantha du Prince, much of the year's best electronic music (Shed, Jon McMillion, Scuba) were triumps of nuance that could have been stamped ""not for beginners."" <i>SLW2</i> is different: The hits feel like buckets of water to the face.  The interceding tracks are turned in by solid veterans (Phillip Lauer's note-perfect, piano-driven house anthem ""Delta NRG"") or potent newcomers (Pollyester has two tracks of their swampy boogie remixed; Moonoton cozies up with 1980s R&amp;B).  Label heads  Tom Bioly and Benjamin FrÃ¶hlich, who record as Permanent Vacation as well, turn in the cinematic, ominous ""Zucker Hut"". The inessential material-- you probably don't need two mixes of Woolfy vs. Projections' ""Neeve"", for instance-- serves as a reminder that <i>SLW2</i> is a singles comp, B-side warts and all.</div>
<p><i>Selected Label Works 2</i> is fun without being goofy.  It is music for your treadmill and your pregaming; it is music to which you dance with strangers until they don't seem like strangers.   When I listen to it, I hear music that is unstressed and unconcerned, and whether you hear echoes of Frankie Knuckles or Patrick Cowley or no one you've ever heard at all, its grooves will seem well-trod in the most welcoming of ways.</p></div>"|14900.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14900-permanent-vacation-selected-label-works-vol-2/|8.1|Andrew Gaerig

He was playing a piano piece composed with a new technique in mind, but he wasn't happy with the piano he was provided. It was a Steinway, not a BÃ¶sendorfer. And so it was that Palestine found himself realizing he simply could not-- should not-- soldier on. What's striking there isn't the fact that a musician had issues with his set-up, or the difference between two exalted kinds of world-class pianos. It's that Palestine was <i>two-and-a-half hours</i> into a single piece when he decided that things just weren't adding up.</p>
<p>The three compositions that make up <i>Strumming </i>are all about the ways that sounds can exhibit spectral effects when pushed beyond their bounds or left alone, or both. Palestine's ""strumming"" technique can be summed up as a method of repeating, repeating, and repeating again. But unlike certain kinds of repetition that lie back and lure a listener into divining effects that may or may not actually exist, Palestine's strumming pieces convey a sense of the composer himself leaning in and muscling such effects into being.</p>
<p>Disc One features ""Strumming forÂ BÃ¶sendorferÂ Piano"", performed by Palestine in 1974. It starts out gently, with a little innocuous tinkling, but over the course of 52 minutes locks into a flurry of reiterated notes and chords that churn out different kinds of overtones. The sounds of those overtones are ethereal, ineffable. But overtones are concrete and real, and Palestine starts to play in reaction to them-- creating still more overtones, until the effect turns into a kind of natural acoustic feedback loop. There's nothing dainty or implicit about it. Palestine is a notably physical presence whose way of playing-- of coaxing by way of banging-- invokes the piano's status as a fundamentally percussive instrument. But there's something innately ghostly about the sounds that surface, like bleary trumpets in a dream or whirring test-tones heard from a distance.</p>
<p>The effects are less striking in the other two pieces. ""Strumming for Harpsichord"", performed by Betsy Freeman in 1977, transpires in a similar fashion, but mostly in an upper register on an instrument less roundly resonant than a piano. On Disc Three, ""Strumming for Strings"" is more of a drone, developing slowly and without a manic sense of rhythm in the foreground. Neither is as magisterial as the one for piano, but both are hypnotic and transporting in their own way. Taken all together, the music of <i>Strumming</i> and its effects sound somehow both discovered and designed. It's like the glints and refractions that figured into early days of spirit photography, when people saw ghosts and metaphysics in what could have just as easily been explained away as a scratch in glass. But what, in the case of music, is the glass?</p></div>"|14902.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14902-strumming-music-for-piano-harpsichord-and-string-ensemble/|7.3|Andy Battaglia

The brainchild of Joe Haege and Corrina Repp, the band has little in common with either the sprained indie rock of his longtime group 31Knots or the muted folk excursions of her solo output. These two Portlanders have, however, lent their talents to each other's records in the past, and Tu Fawning grew out of Haege backing Repp on a European tour a few years ago before it expanded into a quartet of busy multi-instrumentalists. The most outstanding aspect of their debut full-length, <i>Hearts on Hold</i>, is how different this new act is from anything they've ever done. Guitar is only a walk-on; these songs are built on a foundation of droning horns, ambient sounds, and rumbling drums (mostly courtesy of percussionist Toussaint Perrault). Repp sings more forcefully and brazenly in this setting, drawing out her syllables languidly and paring down the lyrics to their barest syllables.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>So, Tu Fawning is a means to indulge all the impulses that don't fit with their day-job acts-- an opportunity to start anew with a different set of rules, influences, and possibilities. <i>Hearts on Hold</i> certainly bears that out; its title is the only mundane thing about it. These songs are crammed with ideas and sounds, inventive and fluid as they bend and change shape. A baleful trumpet loop anchors opener ""Multiply a House"", forming an eerie backdrop whose simplicity reinforces its trip-hop potency. That horn will appear throughout the album, nodding alternately to Haege and Repp's love of early twentieth-century jazz and to cheesy neo-noir soundtracks (remember ""The Salton Sea""?). Such associations are tempered by the percussion, which strictly regiments most of these songs. The simple time-keeping tap of ""Lonely Nights"" suggests the regular thrust of a pickaxe or shovel, which, along with the ominous call-and-response, evokes a field holler or prison work song.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Anchored to prominent drums and gloomy airs, Tu Fawning make a noise that might be best described as organic industrial. Yet, in this context the rigid rhythms of that genre sound stiff, convoluted, and-- perhaps most damningly-- premeditated. The musicians are so intent on creating and sustaining such dark moods that they dampen the songs rather than free them. ""Just Too Much"" struggles to live up to its title, to go off the rail and lead them into danger. Even as they build to a promised payoff, Tu Fawning rein everything in, creating a sense of timidity and truncation. It's a missed opportunity-- and not the only one on <i>Hearts on Hold</i>.</span> The moody atmosphere is an end in itself for the band, but it would make a better starting point.</p>

This is why people talk about Gregg Gillis with a tinge of envy; as Pitchfork's Ryan Dombal has said, Gillis has figured out exactly what he was put on this earth to do--transforming five decades of pop music into seamless, well-paced mixes, and then, live, turning those mixes into a sweaty, tribal celebration of pop music itself.  But while 2008's <i>Feed the Animals </i>proved his staying power and solidified his aesthetic, there was a creeping worry that as long as Gillis stuck with this maximalist mashup thing, we'd be stuck having the same arguments for and against him over and over again. So, the question with his fifth album,<i>All Day: </i> In 2010, is a newly minted Girl Talk fan someone who just simply hasn't heard of him before? Or is Gillis capable of converting those still on the fence?</p>
<p>If there are still holdouts, the arguments against Girl Talk are getting slimmer.<i>All Day</i> is a reminder that, despite the number of party DJs and bedroom mashup artists, nobody does it better than Gillis; here he makes the strongest argument yet for himself as a master of his craft. Initially, Gillis comes off like he's baiting his detractors: his ""legitimacy"" as a DJ has been brought into question on account of having the cleanest hands of any cratedigger, but Gillis<i> </i>goes even <i>more</i> mainstream with his source material (we're talking John Lennon, the Rolling Stones, the Jackson 5...). Compared to <i>All Day</i>, Girl Talk's calling-card LP<i>Night Ripper </i>might as well be <i>Endtroducing...</i> And even those who've enjoyed his work will admit that it's a hell of a lot to take for extended periods of time, yet <i>All Day </i>clocks in at a titanic 71 minutes, almost 20 minutes longer than <i>Animals.</i></p>
<p>Against those odds, Gillis turns these perceived weaknesses into strengths; as his most fussed-over and carefully plotted album, <i>All Day</i> paradoxically sounds like his most effortless. He's still operating within a ""if it's not fun, why do it?"" ethos, but fortunately, it doesn't have the same relentless pacing of his prior work, offering a couple of cooldown moments to collect yourself before spazzing out again (the most notable is the ""Imagine""/ ""One Day"" comedown that closes out <i>All Day</i>). Which is crucial, since <i>All Day </i>is meant to be listened to as a whole. (Gillis admits that the seemingly arbitrary track breakdown is solely for ease of navigation.)</p>
<p>But if I need a five-minute fix, ""Get It Get It"" is the best illustration of how the roomier confines of these songs allow the samples to breathe, evolve, and take on a life of their own without wearing out their welcome. Scoff at the supposed ""wackiness"" of matching ""Pretty Boy Swag"" with ""Windowlicker"" and you'll miss what is arguably Gillis' most inspired musical arrangement. It's not great because of novelty, it's great because it totally makes sense-- it's almost eerie how perfectly Soulja Boy's halting cadences match Aphex Twin's fidgety programming, amplifying the implicit weirdness of the former and the skewed pop instincts of the latter. If M.I.A. realized that agit-pop is greatly enhanced with kickass guitar riffs, she might realize how perfectly tailored Rage Against the Machine's ""Killing in the Name"" is for her protÃ©gÃ© Rye Rye. Later in the track, Gillis pairs up the hyper machismo of Pitbull's ""Hotel Room Service"" with Depeche Mode's ""Just Can't Get Enough"" as a musical illustration of Girl Talk's general outlook, a unity borne of the search for hedonistic pleasure.</p>
<p>Befitting the party-starting functionality of <i>All Day</i>,<i> </i>it doesn't ever go into the chin-stroking appeal of obvious precedent <i>Plunderphonics</i>, and the samples aren't given new contexts so much as new purposes. It's pretty much impossible for ""Sunshine of Your Love"" to <i>sound </i>new, but it's a blast to drop the flower-power lyrics and have Biggie's ""Nasty Boy"" bring out the lurid appeal of the riffs (lolz at Eric Clapton's soloing beginning with the line ""then I whipped it out""). And of course, there's the Easter eggs, the knowing winks and the in-jokes-- an instantly recognizable clip from ""One More Time"" sneaks in for a split second, but Daft Punk lay low for a minute or two before resurfacing for ""Digital Love"". Or chopping up Big Boi's ""Shutterbug"" to stress the line ""I'm double-fisting/ If you're empty you can grab a cup."" Personally, I think the funniest moment is intentionally using the commonly misheard chorus of ""1901"" (it's not ""falling,"" people!) as a punctuation to Ludacris saying ""how low can you go?"" And the instrumental from ""Mr. Big Stuff"" allows the listener to clown Wale's noxious ""Pretty Girls"" hook without saying a word.</p>
<p>Yes, the headslap moments aren't completely eliminated, just far less frequent (""Jane Says""/""Teach Me How to Dougie"" sticks out the most), but even the perceived ""mistakes"" have a plan-- at first, the indelible drum sound from ""Idioteque"" sounds horribly beatmatched with the Isley Brothers' ""Shout"", but that's just the second-long windup before hurtling into a crazed strip-club banger.  And while some might see the use of the piano coda from ""Layla"" backing B.o.B.'s ""Haterz Everywhere"" as sacrilege, the two achieve a bizarre, complex harmony with each other. As far as what the use of Fugazi's ""Waiting Room"" as the foundation for a ""Rude Boy"" mashup is supposed to ""mean""? I'll allow that Gillis is fucking with us sometimes.</p>
<p>When Girl Talk broke through in 2006 with <i>Night Ripper</i>, the album was often credited for reflecting the new listening habits afforded by the Internet, where long-held grudges were dropped and pop, indie rock, classic AOR, and mainstream rap were on equal playing fields. If only that were true; it's easier than ever to wall yourself off from music you dismiss on principle alone, and if we're living in a time when Arcade Fire fans don't want to have their sincerity questioned when they ride for the cause of Waka Flocka Flame or Birdman (""Wake Up"" bridges the gap here between ""Hard in Da Paint"" and ""Money to Blow""), I must've missed it.</p>
<p>What <i>All Day </i>and Girl Talk himself are nostalgic for is not a specific sound or even a specific period of time, even though Gillis' sweet spot is alt-rock and pop-rap from the 90s. It's not ""hey, remember 'Thunder Kiss '65'"" or, ""whoa, what happened to Skee-Lo,"" but rather nostalgia for a time when MTV and radio were the primary methods of conveyance. They weren't perfect, but there was a certain thrill to being something of a captive audience, of letting yourself go and being impressionable for just once, finding out that ""Possum Kingdom"" was pretty rad while waiting for a new Beck single, that both ""Flava in Ya Ear"" and ""Liquid Swords"" were great in their own way and that your parents liked some cool shit after all once you discovered the classic rock station. It's fitting that Gillis went old-school and ""released"" <i>All Day </i>so that everyone could have it at the same time: He wants nothing more than to recapture the thrill of a true communal pop experience.</p></div>"|14899.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14899-all-day/|8.3|Ian Cohen

Cole|['Rap']|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Roc Nation']|2010-11-29 00:00:00|2010|2016-06-11 17:36:27.995534|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".tgxwtebr40.1.6:0.1.0.$14883/=1$14883.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>It should've been J. Cole's big night: the long-awaited release of the Jay-Z protÃ©gÃ©'s <i>Friday Night Lights </i>mixtape on November 12. Instead, the spotlight fell to another Jay: Jay Electronica, who joined Cole on Jay-Z's Roc Nation imprint that night, being introduced by Hova himself at a media-heavy Manhattan gathering, in front of a bunch of writers who would've otherwise been home downloading Cole's mixtape. ""This 'posed to be a moment,"" Cole yells on the tape's intro, as if protesting preemptively.</p>
<p>Beyond their first initial, Cole and Electronica have a lot in common. They're both Southerners who specialize in conscientious, Nas-Style New York rap, and devote their grainy drawls to complex rhyme patterns and even more complex introspection. But Jay Elec is an effortless enigma, a guy who can (and will) rattle off absolute nonsense and make it sound like the deepest thing you ever heard. Cole, in contrast, is the honor student who overthinks everything: Each boast or proposition comes with some sort of tortured justification. It's not enough for him to enjoy the spoils of his success; he has to spell out to us that he's doing it for everyone else who grew up poor in Fayetteville, North Carolina. He's a striver, and he sounds like one.</p>
<p><i>Friday Night Lights</i> is almost entirely a self-produced affair, and it's to Cole's credit that he knows what makes him sound good, even if he does lean too hard on the tinkly piano sound he loves. On the great summer single ""Who Dat"", Cole came off tense and purposeful, as if he were trying to elbow his way onto radio playlists through sheer force of will. <i>Friday Night Lights</i> finds him in a more expansive mode, getting into the minutiae of his own personal story over exclusively midtempo beats. At its best, the tape has an organic warmth that lends it an immediate approachability. At its worst-- the inevitable dragging moments that come with any hour-plus mix focusing mostly on one voice-- that organic pose fades into an all-surface gleam that doesn't really suit Cole at all. When he raps over the rippling lilt of Erykah Badu's ""Didn't Cha Know"", it's perfect. When he raps over Missy Elliott and Aaliyah's gorgeously still ""Best Friends"", it isn't. But Cole is, in the grand scheme, new to this, and there's a good chance he'll figure this stuff out.</p>
<p>Like the TV show that shares its name, <i>Friday Night Lights</i> is an affecting tale of small-town people trying to figure out their paths in life. Cole, who left Fayetteville for college in New York City, explores bits of his own story that little rap music has found space to address-- like being the one college kid who made it out, then returning home to realize that many of his old friends are in prison or Iraq. Or digging into the fluidity of class, and the weird effects it can have on a kid's psyche: ""Me, I lived it all, from dirt poor in a trailer/ Worried about my mother and never trusting my neighbors/ To middle class with a backyard and my own room/ To being the only black kid in my homeroom."" In one painfully vivid moment, he finds himself jealous of the white kids whose parents sent them to school with Lunchables. In another, he wonders whether college was really the best way out: ""One year cost 'bout the same as a Mercedes/ Four years cost wife, crib, and a baby.""</p>
<p>But those sharp moments don't make up the whole of <i>Friday Night Lights</i>, and Cole wanders into less convincing territory when he rants that people never buy music anymore (though he himself has barely released any music that you can actually buy) or when he talks to the ladies. Loverman songs on mixtapes rarely work, but one exception to the rule is Drake, who shows up here to breeze through ""In the Morning"", absolutely schooling Cole on his own track. Cole tries to get clever with this stuff, and it almost always turns out badly; he actually rhymes ""Rihanna"" with ""vee-gina.""</p>
<p>Cole's restless intelligence works against him almost as much as it helps him; you end up wishing he'd just take some delight in a new car or some nice clothes without reminding us, again and again, that he used to be poor. While it's a major theme in rap-- if not <i>the</i> major theme in rap-- that up-from-nothing rise is implicit for most rappers, something to be touched on, not to continually fall back on.</p></div>"|14883.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14883-friday-night-lights/|7.3|Tom Breihan

That's exactly what happens on Bundick's solo side project, Les Sins. His first outing under the name, <i>Lina</i>, is a 12"" double-sided single that sounds like Toro Y Moi on club DJ duty, grafting Italo disco, house, and retrofitted roller boogie elements into his already pop-edified palette. The resulting nine minutes of music explore Bundick's dance-friendly impulses in ways both enjoyable and grating.</p>
<p>A-side ""Lina"" is the real keeper. Bundick establishes a steady groove with a female vocal hook, funked-out bass, and string loops. It's propulsive and clean, even when Bundick starts to deconstruct and chop away at all the details. The first minute or so feels rarefied-- fans of Daft Punk and Avalanches will easily find something to latch onto-- it seems a little pointless to just drop everything into the Cuisinart. But since Bundick is able to shape and re-wrap these elements back into the groove so precisely, all the refitting feels ambitious. ""Lina"" shimmers on the surface and pulsates steadily underneath, making it a perfect fit for some cavernous warehouse space that's packed with bodies and hasn't been hit with a noise violation yet.</p>
<p>""Youth Gone"" is very much the leftfield, exploratory B-side, and despite featuring a similar level of energy, it lacks ""Lina""'s warm, delirious throb. In fact, it's actually a little irritating. A too-short, horn-guided sample leads the first half of the track, imparting a nauseating feeling that awkwardly amplifies some of the skittery leanings of Toro Y Moi proper. Labored and repetitive, ""Youth Gone"" never eases up, even when a more concrete two-step beat is laid down. As a whole, <i>Lina</i> kind of knocks the wind out of you, in ways that feel both pleasurable and disorienting. Still, Les Sins is just the kind of thing you'd want to hear on the side from someone like Bundick-- a brief, intriguing flight of fancy.</p></div>"|14886.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14886-lina/|6.8|Zach Kelly

Take ""Callin' Out"", the first single from his 2003 solo debut,Â <i>Later That Day...</i>, which introduced the MC (real name Tom Shimura) to an audience that might not have been up on his work with Lateef the Truthspeaker as half of Latyrx. Despite his dexterous, lyrically agile performance, ""Callin' Out"" stuck in your head as a body-rocker, with its rubbery knock overshadowing just about everything else. Over the course of three albums now, Lyrics Born has been refining that bounce, searching for a hip-hop future that remains deeply rooted in the funk, disco, and soul of the past. His latest, <i>As U Were</i>, brings all of this to a head, adding current pop and R&amp;B elements to form an ebullient, commercially viable hip-hop record. But despite its ambitions, it feels less like a backpacker's idea of pulling a <i>Love Below</i>, and more like the natural next step from a guy who digs Chic as much as Jurassic 5.</p>
<p>Coming from an underground MC who made his name alongside the likes of Blackalicious and DJ Shadow, <i>As U Were</i>'s mainstream pop lean is downright shocking. Take ""We Live By the Beat"", which works soul-driven horns and a strobe-lit Euro-house hook (complete with Euro-house chanteuse) into a hometown hyphy track. What looks like a mess on paper meshes convincingly on the floor. And even when these amalgamations falter, you still have to admire the ambition. One near miss is the single ""Lies X 3"", which has less impact than it hopes for, sounding like a Hall &amp; Oates tune all jacked-up on Bob Fosse swagger. And maybe the Timbaland move on ""I Wanna B W/U"" feels a little discount, and the sci-fi prog-rock posturing on ""I'm the Best (Funky Fresh in the Flesh)"" a little soggy. But that still can't cloud Shimura's giddy energy. Though most of <i>As U Were</i> shows little interest in staying true to any one form for too long, it's easy to understand why Shimura doesn't consider ""crowd-pleasing"" to be a dirty phrase. He seems happy to find himself in the company of forward-thinking artists with retro-minded fundamentals, Ã Â la Janelle MonÃ¡e.</p>
<p>Ironically, if there is one thing holding these songs back, it's Lyrics Born himself. Shimura spits sparingly, often just to shake a little life into the imaginary crowd once the groove settles. Sometimes, you barely notice whether he's rapping or singing or kind of hanging out somewhere in between. But the more lyrically-minded endeavors lack the pop magnetism that <i>As U Were</i> is all about, so even the more focused head-knock stuff like ""Block Bots"" (boasting a nimble ""B.O.B."" vibe with a few goofed-out James Brown breaks thrown in for good measure) pales in comparison. Stir in some troublingly dull subject matter-- from the sluggish temptation cautionary tale ""I've Lost Myself"" to blandly branding pharmaceutical companies as the true pusher men of today-- and <i>As U Were</i>'s wheels begin to spin. But then, just often enough, you'll stumble on something that sounds like Prince jamming out in a haunted house (""Pushed Aside/Pulled Apart""), or Funkadelic working out to some heavy chiptune synths (""Something Better""). And before you know it, the bounce is back.</p></div>"|14858.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14858-as-u-were/|6.8|Zach Kelly

There were some sugary power-pop gems on that record, but they were outnumbered by alt-rock with tempos that ranged from a mid-paced walk to outright foot-dragging. Perhaps that's why it's a little surprising when one is reminded that Lerner's a part of Merge's stable; his songwriting style uncannily resembles that of the bands featured on Death Cab for Cutie's pre-major label home, Barsuk-- for better and for worse.</p>
<p>Maybe Lerner agrees: Telekinesis' new EP, <i>Parallel Seismic Conspiracies</i>, suggests as much. The five-track release-- a sort of teaser-holdover until the project's forthcoming sophomore full-length, <i>12 Desperate Straight Lines--</i> embraces a scruffy, home-recorded sound absent from the debut. The jump to lo-fi could be cynically seen as trend-jumping at a point where a great deal of new bands are setting up studios in their parents' basements, but it turns out to be a good look for Lerner, adding a sense of rough-around-the-edges charm that suits his songwriting talents well. Not a single song on the EP-- which itself just pushes a 10-minute running time-- goes over three minutes, which makes the immediacy of new songs ""Dirty Thing"" and ""Non-Toxic"" more potent.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, ""Calling All Doctors"", a somewhat grating piano-led lowlight from <i>Telekinesis!</i>, gets a much-needed facelift, as spiky guitar lines and a driving beat turns the previously sad-sack ballad into an enjoyably neurotic earworm. The sprightly rework highlights a new confidence evident on <i>Parallel Seismic Conspiracies</i>, one that perhaps led to a pair of ill-advised covers: Guided by Voices' ""Game of Pricks"" and pre-Joy Division outfit Warsaw's ""The Drawback"". There's nothing specifically wrong with Lerner's take on the former-- if anything, that's the problem. It's merely competent and feels unnecessary. The latter, on the other hand, showcases Lerner's technically impressive drum skills with faster-than-fast fills, but his at times wide-eyed voice sounds ill-fitting when wrapped around the original's wordy, political lyrics (""I find a promise in confessions of true faith/ And hypocrisy that always lies within"").  Lesson to learn: It's okay to stray from your comfort zone-- just don't go, you know, too far.</p></div>"|14893.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14893-parallel-seismic-conspiracies-ep/|6.8|Larry Fitzmaurice

While he was in there, he desperately wanted one of his tapes, and that tape was <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i>, an album already a few years old at that point. Rather than bringing it to him, my dad decided to listen to it, making it about 90 seconds in-- to the first ""Bow down before the one you serve/ You're going to get what you deserve"" bit on ""Head Like a Hole""-- before deciding the album was Satanic and throwing it in the trash. I tried arguing the point with him (""<i>No</i>, dad, he's talking about <i>money</i>! <i>Listen</i> to it!""), but he didn't budge. For much of the 1990s, <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i> was that type of album: One that could inspire fervent, devotional <i>need</i> and absolute revulsion, largely depending on the age of the person hearing it. And that's even more impressive when you consider that it's basically a <i>synth-pop</i> album.</p>
<p>The greatest trick Trent Reznor ever pulled was convincing the world he was the devil. With his biblical-phallic band name, his reportedly furious early live shows, his fishnets worn as sleeves, Reznor staked out a position for himself on the Alice Cooper shock-rock continuum. Reznor certainly talked a big game about his industrial influences, even taking part in the Wax Trax! collective Pigface, but it wasn't the punishing megaphone-addled arm of industrial that most informed Reznor's debut album; it was the genre's nascent new-wave period. Scene kings Ministry, after all, started out as floppy-haired New Romantics. And so, for that matter, did Reznor himself; Google <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJYBx5NJULY"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Exotic Birds"">Exotic Birds</a> sometime.</p>
<p>Reznor would progress further into scraping roar not long later; 1992's ""Wish"" was certainly no Depeche Mode song. But <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i> is haunted, synthetic dance-pop through and through. The beats have muscle, but it's not metal muscle or pigfuck muscle or even post-punk muscle.Â ""Head Like a Hole"", the big hit, is probably the most rock thing on the whole album, but even that song opens with ""Heart of Glass""-esque percussion ripples before the drum machine thunder and weird hooting noises come in. ""Terrible Lie"" is built on synth-scrapes that, in less distorted form, could've shown up on a New Order single, and ""Sin"" likewise has a whole lot of ""Blue Monday"" in its DNA. Whenever a verse ends during ""Kinda I Want To"", we get a quick little reptilian disco synth-fight. Glacial new-age keyboard tones abound, and big nasty guitars really don't. And Reznor knew how to mine this form for all the emotional catharsis it was worth, which was a lot.</p>
<p>But Reznor still stood out as a rock star, maybe <i>the</i> rock star of the time. Largely, that's a credit to his absolutely magnificent rock-star voice, one of the finest of his generation. On <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i>, Reznor sounds tough but also strained and vulnerable. There's a huge, frustrated mall-kid aspect to his voice, to the way it goes from defeated mutter to impotent yowl in no time flat. It's like he knows how petty he can sound, but he can't help himself. There's plenty of rancor on <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i>, too, much of it directed at some unspecific ""you"" that made his frustration all the more relatable: ""I gave you my purity, and my purity you stole."" On ""Terrible Lie"", he never bothers to specify what the lie in question is; does it matter? ""Why am I seething with this animosity?"" he asks, like even he doesn't know and can't justify it.</p>
<p>Much of <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i> concerns a simple scenario: Being young but feeling that your life is already over, that your best days are already behind you. On ""Down in It"": ""I used to be somebody."" On ""That's What I Get"": ""How can you turn me into this/ After you just taught me how to kiss... you?"" (On that extended pause, Reznor sounds like he's 12, like that ""you"" will never arrive and he's just admitted that he never made out with anyone before.) And on the time-stopping album centerpiece ""Something I Can Never Have"": ""Everywhere I look, you're all I see/ Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be."" ""Something I Can Never Have"" is where Reznor's vulnerability really becomes his greatest asset. His scream gone, his voice turns to pure bottomless dejection. He's carefully considered every aspect of his life, and nothing looks good. In the words of decade-later imitators Linkin Park, he sounds like he's about to break. Or like he's already broken.</p>
<p>""Something I Can Never Have"" also shows an absolute mastery which would blossom soon after into something like genius, and which was already pretty far along in 1989. Starting with nothing but a haunted, minimal piano figure and a few hushed synth tones, the track slowly lets in sputtering static, faraway door-slam drums, and quiet little counter-melodies. Guitar never shows up; it'd break the spell. When NIN would do this track live, you could practically hear the collective intake of breath at those first piano notes. As far as I'm concerned, it's probably the single finest song Reznor ever wrote.</p>
<p>In later years, Reznor would push all the ideas on <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i> even further-- into a sputtering maelstrom, depressive stillness, zoned-out trance-states, and terrible beauty. But the ideas are all there already, contained in a 10-song capsule that ends quickly enough that everything lingers. Most of the songs on <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i> are fairly long, but no time is wasted. This new reissue doesn't much alter that original experience. The remaster job doesn't sound much different from the original article, and the sole bonus track, a sexed-up B-side cover of Queen's ""Get Down Make Love"", sort of misses the point; this was, in a lot of ways, an album about <i>not</i> getting laid. So the real reason to revisit the album is the album itself, nothing else. Now that Reznor has retired the NIN touring institution and become a sort of Internet-friendly cool-uncle figure, it's pretty striking to go back to that seismic first strike and re-feel all the stuff we first felt hearing this thing.</p></div>"|14890.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14890-pretty-hate-machine/|9.5|Tom Breihan

If she's not spilling milk with Drake in a  (impressively spotless) bodega in her ""What's My Name?"" video, she's  playfully grabbing Nicki Minaj's ass at the American Music Awards or  living out millions of karaoke dreams by singing ""Livin' on a Prayer""  with Bon Jovi during a recent show in Madrid. All the while whipping her  neon-stop-sign hair and smiling and throwing up ridiculous devil's  horns. All this just a year after <i>Rated R</i>, her spiked-out  reaction to staggering emotional and physical trauma. And while that  cathartic album provided an outlet for her frustrations and allowed her  to claim some artistic bona fides, the actual songs were often plodding  and weighed down by overwrought melodrama. Not so on <i>Loud</i>, which has the 22-year-old Barbados-born star picking up where 2007's <i>Good Girl Gone Bad</i> left off, doling out effervescent pop like it was her birthright.</p>
<p>""Life's  too short to be sittin' around miserable,"" sings Rihanna with a shrug  on future 2 a.m. staple ""Cheers (Drink to That)"". ""People are gonna talk  whether you're doin' bad or good."" The lines sum up the general  sentiment of <i>Loud</i> nicely. There's no grand statement here, no tabloid back story. And while Rihanna had a hand in writing most of the songs on <i>Rated R</i>,  she's not credited with writing anything here. But she's more  experienced, and unlike some of her early material, you feel like she's  actually connecting with these tunes on more than a purely melodic  level. In his review of <i>Good Girl</i>, Pitchfork's Tom Breihan wrote that  Rihanna ""comes off sounding like a robot programmed to impersonate  Alanis Morissette."" And the acoustic strums and mid-tempo drum beat--  not to mention the vocal sample of Avril Lavigne's ""I'm With You""-- on  ""Cheers"" are particularly Alanis-esque. But now Rihanna is capable of  adding her own West Indian lilt and charisma to the tipsy track-- you  can almost hear her smirk as she brings hashtag rap to pop&amp;B: ""It's  gettin' Coyote Ugly up in here/ No Tyra!""</p>
<p>After releasing five  albums in as many years, the singer is closer than ever to becoming the  complete pop package Jay-Z envisioned when he signed her the same day  she walked into Def Jam during his tenure as president. Though gifted  with runway-ready looks, Rihanna has improved in other areas through  sheer perseverance. Her voice-- once fragile and shrill-- is now robust  enough to take on songs like the delightfully Eurotrash pounder ""Only  Girl (In the World)"" not only on record but at high profile awards-show  performances. Her semi-scripted dance moves are sultry and spontaneous.  She can be kinda funny (or at least genuinely excitable) in interviews.  She'll never be as boldly talented asÂ BeyoncÃ©Â or freakishly engaging as  Gaga, but there's still charm to be found in her (relatively) everyday  affability. She recently said <i>Loud</i> was the first album she wasn't nervous about releasing, which makes a lot of sense. She's worked hard to get to this point.</p>
<p>If  anything, the record sounds too easy at times. ""California King Bed"" is  a ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing""-type power ballad genetically engineered  to soundtrack a bi-coastal Kate Hudson rom-com. ""Raining Men"" is a  shameless BeyoncÃ©Â rip-off that would be quickly dismissed if not for the  fact that it's a pretty-damn-good BeyoncÃ© rip off with a  characteristically scene-stealing guest verse from Nicki Minaj.  Meanwhile, ""Fading"" copies Rihanna's own lightweight R&amp;B formula so much  it's redundant.</p>
<p>On the flip, ""Man Down"" takes her violent side to its  logical conclusion as it finds her on the run after killing a poor guy  dead, its reggae bounce matching perfectly with Rihanna's mesmerizing  cadence. And ""Skin"" is her sexiest song yet, a haunted, near-dubstep  stunner that wouldn't sound totally out of place on Massive Attack's <i>Mezzanine</i>. Her laissez-faire attitude toward hit-making on <i>Loud</i> can result in too-safe moves or semi-experiments that come off  surprisingly great, but, at this rate, by the time she runs out of  singles from this record there will be another one ready to go. More  than a stocking stuffer but less than an idol, Rihanna has grown into one of  the most reliable pop stars we've got.</p></div>"|14897.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14897-loud/|7.6|Ryan Dombal

She's delivered a stream of song-stealing or song-saving guest verses, one dynamite mixtape (<i>Beam Me Up Scotty</i>) and another, as good, unofficial one (<i>Barbie World</i>), and generally displayed a swagger, unpredictability, and ferocity not heard from a female MC in years. Little of that, however, is on her long-awaited debut album, <i>Pink Friday</i>.</p>
<p>Minaj turned a lot of heads by coming out of the gate as a supremely confident, powerful MC in any one of the many guises she has chosen to inhabit. She's been most often bracketed with Lil' Kim, but those comparisons are more about image and sexuality than her music; at her best, Minaj on the mic is far closer to the free-spirited, without-a-net work of Missy Elliott. She displays a wide range of talents, stuffing her verses with complex internal rhymes, agile shifts in character and voice, and twisted, offbeat wordplay. Avoiding easy categorization on her mixtapes and guest verses, Minaj has played the coquette, the powerhouse, the lady, the diva, the rapper's rapper, the fembot, and the comedian. She's posed as Rihanna on the batshit awesome ""Saxon"", played the harajuku Barbie on ""Beam Me Up Scotty"", and shapeshifted into battle rapper mode on ""Itty Bitty Piggy"". And while she plays fast and loose with her past, her inclination to slip into a number of characters is the work of a creative former theater kid rather than a myth-making rapper.</p>
<p>And then her debut mainstream single, the rhythmically militaristic ""Massive Attack"", stiffed-- failing to chart on either the U.S. pop or rap charts. A few months later, the Annie Lennox-sampling hip-hop ballad ""Your Love""-- a track she recorded a couple of years ago, most likely as a demo-- became an accidental hit, rising from an online leak to radio. And so now the woman who stole Kanye West's ""Monster"" from her all-star cohorts spends the bulk of her solo debut singing instead of rapping, leaning on recognizable and often corny 1980s/90s samples, and fronting a series of midtempo songs that inevitably lean into the string-led chorus so popular in R&amp;B these days. In short: The most unpredictable voice in hip-hop decided she wanted to be like everyone else. Fortunately, even when she's aiming down the middle of the road, she's at least better than almost anyone else.</p>
<p>Minaj will get praise for her depth of skills, but this album isn't about showing off a range of talents-- it's about leaning on the ones that have worked in the marketplace. Oddly, she comes out of the gate with the album's most aggressive and most successful run of tracks, so livening up the clattering Swizz Beatz production ""Roman's Revenge"" that you're tempted to try to repeatedly get through it, even knowing that it contains Eminem recycling his Shady-circa-99 persona. The Bangladesh production ""Did It on 'Em"" is the record's best track, one of the few times Minaj goes to toe-to-toe with a huge beat.Â Minaj is upstaged by Drake and Kanye West on ""Moment 4 Life"" and ""Blazin'"", respectively, but these tracks-- plus the Rihanna collaboration ""Fly"" and the solo ballad ""Save Me""-- are the best examples of what <i>Pink Friday</i> is rather than what many of us wanted it to be. That quartet of songs is proof that, even with commercial concessions, Minaj could have knocked out a great pop record, though one with anemic singles like ""Check It Out"" and ""Right Thru Me"" was never going to be it.</p>
<p>The gulf between Minaj's public persona and her music here reminds me of the criticism laid at the feet of Lady Gaga-- that for all of her high-culture namedropping, wearable art, and big event videos, Gaga's music rarely reflects the full range of her conceptual constructions. Gaga's emergence has certainly stylistically loosed up America's top female stars. Alongside the emergence of Minaj and Ke$ha, Rihanna, Katy Perry, and even the often conservative BeyoncÃ© have enjoyed the license to be more flamboyant and delightfully cartoonish. In most cases, however, their music is in line with current fashion rather than setting it. (That said, the artist here closest in line with the the sound of today's top 40, Rihanna, is also the most consistently excellent; while it's Ke$ha, the one most forging her own path, who is irredeemably awful.) It's almost as if this generation of pop starlets is content to play outsized personalities at awards shows, photo shoots, and videos, yet stay within a sleepy comfort zone on record. Seeing Minaj fall into this rut is particularly disappointing.</p>
<p>The inclination here is to blame the label, but a song like ""Dear Old Nicki"" reads almost as a defense of what she's done on this album, and that's more disappointing than the actual record. (Perhaps not surprisingly, all four of the bonus tracks spread across different versions of the LP are rap songs; two of them-- ""Blow Ya Mind"" and ""Muny""-- are among the best songs on the record.) A letter to her ""old,"" unhinged, more restless persona, Minaj excuses the decisions she's made on this record because of the money she stands to make from it. ""You was underground, and I was mainstream/ I live the life now, that we would daydream,"" Minaj the R&amp;B star tells her more creative self. It's a deflating song on what, despite being a good modern pop album, is a depressing Nicki Minaj album.</p></div>"|14898.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14898-pink-friday/|6.5|Scott Plagenhoef

Sprawling and arid, you often found yourself transported to unfamiliar, awesome terrains, rendered even more fascinating because of their organic qualities. With <i>Off Duty</i>, the follow up three-track 12"" (coupled with the two songs that comprise <i>Boat Trip on</i> the CD EP version), Sun Araw is once again creating a group of richly detailed songs that capture <i>On Patrol</i>'s panoramic scope. <i>Off Duty</i> also feels like a walkabout of sorts, but most of the exploration takes place in the ruins.</p>
<p>One of Sun Araw's greatest assets is his ability to afford these parched, post-apocalyptic pieces a proper cinematic quality. ""Last Chants"" is enveloped by a hot wind that carries through even as Sun Araw introduces spring-loaded synths and an aquatic dub that ends up shaping the song. It's like stepping out of <i>The Terminator</i> and into the paranoid daze of a <i>Mad Max</i> movie. Another great accomplishment of Sun Araw's music is the simple yet magnetic use of loping rhythms, used here to suck even the prickliest of textures into the swirling, discombobulated funk.</p>
<p>""Deep Temple"" goes a step further, stretching these principles to their monolithic maximums, using strangled guitars and synths to balance out some of the noisier peaks.Â Remaining track ""Midnight Locker"", as well as the two tracks featured on <i>Boat Trip</i>, chronicle Sun Araw's commitment to gooey experimentalism. Though the most prominent psychedelic features aren't as immediately recognizable here, the drone-stained details make up for the lack of inertia. ""In the Trees"" is spacious, surreal, and deeply invested in blending futuristic, industrial bits in with elements that sound both decades- (blacklit guitar noodlings) and centuries-old (primordial chant suites). Like <i>Off Duty</i> and <i>Boat Trip</i> on the whole, it's further proof that few are doing this stuff quite as well as Sun Araw is these days.</p></div>"|14873.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14873-off-duty-ep/|7.7|Zach Kelly

Either way, it has quite a track record of contributing to the Brooklyn music scene (see: MGMT, Amazing Baby, and the other band of Das Racist's Victor Vazquez, Boy Crisis). And now, following the success of MGMT, Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden's former classmates and opening act Bear Hands have thrown their hat into the ring too, finally releasing their full-length debut three years after issuing theÂ <i>Golden </i>EP.</p>
<p>What sets Bear Hands apart from not only their former school friends but also the rest of those outer-borough inhabitants enamored of reverb pedals, ramshackle rhythms, and throbbing bass, is their quirky sense of humor. Frontman Dylan Rau, who has both the unhinged bark of Isaac Brock and the reedy, sinewy whine of MGMT's VanWyngarden, sings about eating cats or Julien Donkey-Boy, the title character in Harmony Korine's bizarre Dogme 95 film. And despite its markedly slower pace and haunting arrangement, ""Wicksey Boxing"" has its own inherent wit, given that it takes its name from a slurred-drunk pronunciation of ""whiskey boxing,"" a sport best to avoid.</p>
<p>But amid such punning-- and other, more abstract lyrical turns-- Bear Hands have a softer, more earnest side, too. On ""Belongings"", Rau sings, ""At the gentle age of nine, I bought my first 45/ And then I drink, yeah, I drink, yeah... I smoke a little weed."" It's a song that's suffused with the excitement of first falling in love with music and a nostalgia for the innocence and excitement of youth.Â If anything, though, it is <i>Burning Bush Supper Club</i>'s musically softer moments that are its weakest.</p>
<p>Bear Hands excel at crafting songs that chug manically under a cloud of reverb or coax wallflowers out onto the dancefloor with an infectious marriage of musical precision and experimental messiness. But after seven straight tracks of upbeat psych-rock, ""Wicksey Boxing"" kicks off an album-ending run of mostly plodding, mid-tempo tunes. Though Bear Hands get the atmosphere right on these slower tracks, layering echoing effects over sparse riffs, starburst synth crescendos, and Rau's most vulnerable warble, these more muted, intimate songs feel lacking next to the passionate drive and playful spirit of the rest of the album. Overall though, <i>Burning Bush Supper Club</i> is the album <i>Congratulations</i> should have been: one that sharpens the lush, hedonistic surrealism of reverb-laden psych-rock into tightly focused anthems that are just anarchic enough as to be unpredictable.</p></div>"|14879.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14879-burning-bush-supper-club/|7.1|Rebecca Raber

Nothing to see here. This collection, the first proper North American best-of in Jay-Z's career, is what it says it is: a compendium of his most successful songs. Or, it seems that way at first. There's some mixed messaging. Of the 14 songs here, six were recorded post-retirement. Only two were released before 2000: 1998's ""Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)"" and 1999's ""Big Pimpin'"". Jay's first two albums, 1996's crucial <i>Reasonable Doubt</i> and its 1997 follow-up, <i>In My Lifetime, Vol. 1</i>, are not represented. Three songs included here failed to reach the top quarter of <i>Billboard</i>'s Hot 100 chart (""Public Service Announcement [Interlude]"", ""Encore"", and surprisingly, ""99 Problems""), each of which originated with 2003's faux swan song, <i>The Black Album</i>. Though they're recognized fan favorites that feature emblematic moments in Jay's career, there have been bigger hits.</p>
<p>""Change Clothes"", ""Girls, Girls, Girls"", ""Excuse Me Miss"", and the recent ""Young Forever""-- all of which charted higher than the above and 2009's ""D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)"", also included-- are absent. ""'03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde"", by most reasonable metrics, is a worse song than ""Girls, Girls, Girls"". But ""'03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde"" went all the way to #4, so that couldn't go. But then, none of this logic matters. Last year, when Jay-Z's ""Empire State of Mind"" became his first #1 single, he finally qualified for a hits package like this-- one that skews toward casual fans more than completists.</p>
<p>It's fitting, because these days Jay-Z is expanding, more than usual, by opening his world to the casual fan. The recent release of his memoir/lyric anthology, <i>Decoded</i>, prompted several high-profile interviews, including trips to NPR's ""Fresh Air"",Â ""The Daily Show"", ""Oprah"", ""Charlie Rose"", and a formal conversation with Cornel West at the New York Public Library. During these interviews, he was repeatedly asked about things the book explains that longtime followers already know: his youth in the Marcy projects, the art of hustling, his complicated relationship to misogyny, President Obama. Just last week, I listened to him explain the punning kicker on the second verse of ""99 Problems"" at least five times.</p>
<p>Jay was savvy and wry as ever, but these were mostly facile conversations-- though hearing ""Fresh Air""'s Terry Gross press him on whether or not he stabbed alleged bootlegger and former friend Lance ""Un"" Rivera, a topic long danced around by music journalists, was genuinely thrilling. But they were necessary trips through yet another turnstile for Jay-Z, into the homes of more people who only vaguely understood his craft. Now, hundreds, maybe thousands of housewives, know what ""the work"" is to a drug dealer. And now Jay-Z carries a literary badge, continuing to deftly legitimize his art to the unsuspecting. Rap has been big business for nearly two decades, but the genre's rise to respectability has been slower and more arduous. The <i>Decoded</i> media tour has done much to advance rap in theory, while quietly boring ardent followers.</p>
<p><i>Hits Collection</i> is no different. Regardless of the methodology between the song selections, many will scoff at <i>Kingdom Come</i>'s ""Show Me What Ya Got"", best remembered as a beer commercial, and the three additions from last year's <i>The Blueprint 3</i>. That album was dismissed as harshly by loyalists as it was embraced by moderates-- neither were right, but the inclusion of ""D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)"", ""Empire"", and the event-like but mediocre ""Run This Town"" instead of ""Can't Knock the Hustle"" or ""Ain't No Nigga"" feels like a case of selective memory. Those songs don't happen without what came first; sometimes Hits aren't the same as hits. One trip to a Jay-Z concert proves as much-- there's no sure bet that ""'03 Bonnie and Clyde"" will performed, but you can almost always count on ""Where I'm From"", a fierce longtime live staple from <i>Vol. 1</i>. It didn't chart, and it's not included.</p>
<p>There is a carrot for hardcore fans. A press release for<i> Hits Collection</i> calls the five songs included on the Deluxe Edition's bonus disc ""impossible-to-find,"" which is only true if you've never heard of Mediafire. The extras are interestingly curated, though. A freestyle over onetime consort Big Daddy Kane's ""Young, Gifted and Black"" marks a nod to the past-- it first appeared on the excellent <i>S. Carter</i> <i>Collection Mixtape</i>, released as a promotional bonus when Jay's Reebok sneaker was issued. From that same mixtape comes ""Pump It Up (Freestyle)"", a self-mythologizing flurry that effectively ended Joe Budden's chance at big-time rap stardom in 117 seconds. ""My President is Black (Remix)"" is a nod to Progressive Hov,Â visitor of White Houses and Bono hobnobber. DJ Khaled's ""Go Hard (Remix)"" is the strangest choice: It's a virtuosic verse on a titanic song, but lacks meaning. The final song is the underrated and little-heard ""This Life Forever"", first released on the soundtrack for the film adaptation of Donald Goines' crime saga <i>Black Gangster</i>. The movie was actually never made, but the song has become the Ark of the Covenant for Jay-Z diehards-- Jay also annotates it in <i>Decoded</i>, despite its low profile.</p>
<p>That last track especially feels a concession to those who waded through the hits, and a revealing entry point for casual fans approaching the bonus disc. Still, where Jay-Z's albums are typically shaded and complex works buttressed by commercial extravagance, this collection is something of an inversion. Opening with ""P.S.A."" and closing with ""This Life Forever"" is a subtle but resonant message: Are you still down?</p></div>"|14892.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14892-the-hits-collection-vol-one/|7.5|Sean Fennessey

We do know that it's the alias of Los Angeles-via-Michigan songwriter Ben Schneider, and although they're a full band live, everything on the EPs was performed by Schneider alone. That's about it. Predictably, much of the empty space has been filled with ""RIYL"" namedrops that haven't done anyone any favors. Not only is it the most reductive form of critique, but the things that stick out on a casual listen-- the Afro-Caribbean percussion, the luminous, ascendant harmonies, the blown-out reverb-- makeÂ <i>Mighty</i> come off like it's yet another bloggy bedroom product utilizing indie rock's most played-out resources. And yet, trying to box in <i>Mighty</i> only highlights what makes it an invigorating listen. It's something like a stylistic superball, bouncing off any wall you put around it.</p>
<p>The title track fades in from watery echo, morphing into a blur of assorted percussion, steel drums, and something almost sitar-like as Schneider's whooping melodies carry ""Mighty"" ever upward. The Panda Bear comparisons are inevitable and understandable, but there's more propulsion, more stately purpose, and the lyrics espouse tapping into one's own primitivism, which ironically is a topic that Animal Collective stopped writing about years ago. But immediately thereafter, <i>Mighty</i> reveals itself as not really being of the zeitgeist at all. It's likely a result of Schneider's high lonesome twang recalling My Morning Jacket's Jim James, but the phrase I keep thinking of in regards to <i>Mighty</i> is ""Bermuda Highway""-- the tropical trimmings are crucial to establishing the hurtling momentum of what are rangy road songs at their core.</p>
<p>This is especially true of ""Son of a Gun"", which explores both wanderlust and plain old lust over a swaying waltz. The earlier <i>Into the Sun</i> EP showed that Schneider has a way with hot-blooded confrontation that's pleasantly jarring within the billowy production, and that certainly holds true here, as he relates how infatuation eventually evolves into a cold-blooded vengeance in a woman wronged by that same man. That it's all under the same fever dream emphasizes how both feelings are merely points on the same continuum. The sonic dichotomy is most pronounced on ""The Stranger"", where American roots instrumentation (pedal steel, mandolin) are smeared together with bongos and shakers into a hypnotic gallop, bringing to the fore the biggest flaw in the ongoing criticism of white boys copping international rhythmic influence: With so many sonic possibilities available to us, what, exactly, is admirable about strictly adhering to a codified American indie template?</p>
<p><i>Mighty</i> ends on a somber note with ""When Will I See You Again?"", the one time where Lord Huron really feels like the solo project it is. Schneider's lyrics run alternately spiteful and accepting before the last thing you hear is him repeating the title, holding on to some glimmer of hope for reconciliation. It's here that the ties to pre-<i>Z</i> My Morning Jacket really start to show: Instead of obscuring Schneider's voice, the grain silos full of reverb make it superhumanly expansive. But more importantly, no matter how far into the clouds he gets, beneath it all is gut-level, emotive songwriting that hits directly and honestly.</p></div>"|14887.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14887-mighty-ep/|8.0|Ian Cohen

The material's still a little shocking 26 years later, if only because there's very little else that sounds like it. Pounding on scrap metal and playing with power tools, the early Neubauten made a feral and highly rhythmic brand of punk noise. A large number of Neubauten imitators sprang up in the 1980s, banging away on oil drums and shopping carts, but none of the copycats played with the intensity of the originators. Its some of the only music out there that sounds like it was actually painful to make.</p>
<p>The band captured on <i>Strategies Against Architecture, Vol. 4</i>, which collects material from 2002 to 2010, is obviously not the same band, even if it shares many of the same members. Neubauten were able to wring a surprising amount of drama and invention from their original, abrasive toolkit, but even still, by the mid 80s they'd taken that harsh, stark clanging about as far as it could go. If the original <i>SAA</i> had a frighteningly single-minded sound, <i>SAA4</i> is all over the map, a good one-stop introduction to the varied ways the band's tried to move beyond its scorched-earth beginnings over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>Neubauten once made a virtue of destruction; their name translates to ""Collapsing New Buildings,"" a phrase which captures the girder-snapping intensity of those early records very well. Neubauten almost had to lighten up a little, both physically and artistically, to survive three decades. So while Neubauten's still more likely to make music by taking jackhammers to the Brill Building, they're no longer opposed to concepts like melody, quiet, and nuance. Some of <i>SAA4</i>'s most affecting moments-- the buzzing, transfixing drone on ""Insomnia""; the mix of gamelan-style percussion and music-box IDM on ""Jeder Satz mit ihr Hallt Nach"" and ""Weil Weil WeilÂ (Freie Radikale in der Warteschleife)""-- are its most restrained.</p>
<p>But Neubauten haven't exactly mellowed over the last 20 years either. Right from the very first song, ""Perpetuum Mobile"", there are constant reminders of the style that made the band famous, but with a thicker, richer, layered sound. If albums like <i>SAA</i> and 1981'sÂ <i>Kollaps</i> sound like shrill field recordings from a particularly gruesome factory mishap, even the brutalist Neubauten of the 21st century has a psychedelic lushness, the tribal end of Krautrock meets the immersive sound-wash of experimental electronica. So dark as things can get, this is still a supremely listenable set, and that's what will be most surprising for those who know Neubauten by early reputation alone. Playful and menacing, gentle and ugly, <i>SAA4</i> has a range that no one, probably even the band itself, would have thought possible back in 1984.</p></div>"|14891.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14891-strategies-against-architecture-vol-4/|7.0|Jess Harvell

So screamed the headline of the December 16, 2000 edition of theÂ <i>NME</i>. The words appeared atop a photo of a grinning Damon Gough, who wasn't just smiling over the Flavor Flav-style clock strapped to his neck: his universally acclaimed full-length debut, <i>The Hour of Bewilderbeast </i>had snagged the UK Mercury Prize for best album of the year. Upon arrival, Gough was a hyper-prolific songwriter who could pull charmingly ramshackle soft-rock lullabies out of his toque as easily as getting water from a tap, but little did we realize how literal the <i>NME</i>'s definition of ""now"" would prove to be. Rather than rise to the echelons of the songwriters who so clearly inspired him-- John Lennon, Bruce Springsteen, Nick Drake-- Gough spent the rest of the decade weathering the familiar fate of former next-big-things, watching his critical and commercial stock decline over a series of lukewarmly received releases, and switching labels album to album in an effort to reignite his career.</p>
<p>Of course, Badly Drawn Boy is hardly the first artist to peak on his first album, but as Gough's latest release attests, so few are willing to use that lingering sense of disappointment and wasted potential as the conceptual framework for a trilogy of albums. Recorded during a reported surge of inspiration that carried over from last year's <i>Is There Nothing We Could Do?</i>-- a soundtrack companion to the UK telefilm <i>The Fattest Man in Britain</i>--Â the hastily conceived and recorded <i>It's What I'm Thinking (</i>to be released over the next year in three parts, Robyn-style) sees Gough reunite with <i>Bewilderbeast</i> co-conspirator Andy Votel and considerably tone down the eager-to-please ostentation that marred 2004's <i>One Plus One Is One</i> and 2006's <i>Born in the U.K.</i> The songs on this first installment, <i>Photographic Snowflakes</i>, are ostensibly about making amends and starting over, but not so much in the context of a stagnant relationship as that of a career at the crossroads: ""I'mÂ ready to be in love again,"" Gough sings optimistically amid the Spectorized sleigh-bell strut of ""Too Many Miracles"", an address that seems directed less at an old flame than his old fans.</p>
<p>At the outset at least, <i>Photographing Snowflakes</i> carries the promise of rekindled romance: opener ""In Safe Hands"" bears a spare, spectral quality largely unheard in Gough's work since <i>Bewilderbeast</i>, while the album's most captivating track, ""The Order of Things"", sees Gough lay out all his doubts and insecurities over a tick-tock drum-machine track, while triggered snare rolls, synth textures and radio frequencies gently amplify the feeling of hermetic, fever-dream psychosis. (At one point, he even casts blame for his creative inertia to the ""birds in the sky"" who ""steal my melodies."") But for all its surface similarities to Gough's definitive debut-- ""A Pure Accident"" even directly references signature song ""Magic in the Air""-- <i>Photographing Snowflakes</i> is ultimately more an echo of <i>Bewilderbeast</i> than an answer to its challenge, mostly because Gough used to be a far more playful and expressive vocalist, whereas his unaffected, plain-spoken performances here serve only to magnify the repetitious quality of his songwriting. Whether you feel <i>Photographing Snowflakes</i> is a true return to form will depend on your reception of its six-minute title track centerpiece, on which Gough drowsily monotones his way through 10 increasingly whimsical verses with no chorus in sight; you'll either find its slow-motion, pedal-steeled sway charmingly wistful or tediously self-satisfied. Then again, when your time is no longer now, what's the point of watching the clock?</p></div>"|14884.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14884-its-what-im-thinking-part-one-photographing-snowflakes/|6.5|Stuart Berman

They chose the business route, launching a suite of enterprises collectively called Apple Corps, most of which were boondoggles. Apple Electronics was a disaster; Apple Studio was a joke; the Apple Boutique lasted seven months before they gave up and announced that they were simply giving away the rest of their stock. Apple Records might have been a similarly dubious idea-- the Beatles weren't short of hangers-on, and the label's roster was heavily populated by longtime pals of the group and curiosities they decided to release on a whim. But if the Beatles knew how to do one thing, it was make records, and almost everything in the Apple discography is somewhere between ""interesting"" and ""superb.""</p>
<p>This one-disc singles compilation, spanning 1968-1972, isn't quite what its title promises: The Beatles' post-""Hey Jude"" records, and their early solo records, aren't on here. (It's being released alongside reissues of most of Apple's not-Beatles-or-Yoko album catalogue.) Still, they're all over it. Paul McCartney wrote the winning oompah instrumental ""Thingumybob"" for the Black Dyke Mills Band and ""Goodbye"" for Mary Hopkin, and he told Badfinger they could have his new song ""Come and Get It"" if they played it note-for-note like his demo. George Harrison wrote ""Try Some, Buy Some"" for ex-Ronette Ronnie Spector and the explosive rocker ""Sour Milk Sea"" for his old Liverpool pal Jackie Lomax. (The backing band on the latter includes George, Paul, Ringo Starr, and Eric Clapton; recorded during the White Album sessions, it would've been one of the best songs on that record if George had kept it for himself.)</p>
<p>The Beatles were canny judges of popular taste, too, and this set includes a handful of hits that have been out of circulation for years, thanks to the Apple catalogue's being in limbo. Mary Hopkin's ""Those Were the Days
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
"" was No. 2 in the U.S. (and bumped ""Hey Jude"" off the top
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
of the British charts); Billy Preston's ""That's the Way God Planned It"" and ""My Sweet Lord"" (recorded before Harrison's own version), Chris Hodge's glam-rock boogie ""We're on Our Way"", and Badfinger's ""Come and Get It"" and ""Day After Day"" all made the charts in America.</p>
<p>What makes <i>Come and Get It </i>really fun, though, is the same thing that made the Beatles' own Apple releases particularly entertaining: their willingness to go to bat for totally uncommercial ideas. George managed to get the Radha Krishna Temple on ""Top of the Pops"", released a single by the Cajun band the Sundown Playboys just because he liked it, and made a nifty album with then-forgotten American soul singer Doris Troy (represented here by the single ""Ain't That Cute""). Paul played bass on the debut single by then-unknown folk singer James Taylor. John Lennon (and Yoko Ono) wrote a benefit single for the underground newspaper <i>Oz</i>, ""God Save Us"", released by Bill Elliot and the Elastic Oz Band (aka John, Ringo, and Klaus Voorman).</p>
<p>There are a couple of outright duds here, especially Brute Force's one-joke ""King of Fuh""-- which George had pressed up with an Apple label despite (or maybe because of) the fact that no store would dare to carry it in 1969-- and a cranky reggae cover of ""Give Peace a Chance"" by Hot Chocolate Band (who'd do much better once they dropped the last word from their name). Still, this is a fascinating document of one of the most adventurous labels of its era, built around a group so creatively fertile that they could pass their own mojo on to almost everyone they worked with.</p></div>"|14810.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14810-come-and-get-it-the-best-of-apple-records/|8.5|Douglas Wolk

Fireworks flash while red hoods march through a field. At the center of the spectacle is a huge, pale, cartoonish rendering of Michael Jackson's head.Â <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i>'s gargantuan ""All of the Lights"" soundtracks the procession, with Kanye pleading, ""Something wrong, I hold my head/ MJ gone, our nigga dead."" The tribute marks another chapter in West's ongoing obsession with the King of Pop.</p>
<p>West's discography contains innumerable references and allusions to Jackson. His first hit as a producer, Jay-Z's ""Izzo (H.O.V.A.)"", sampled the Jackson 5's ""I Want You Back"". For many, his first memorable lines as a rapper came during 2003's ""Slow Jamz"": ""She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson/ Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson."" And when West's recent interview with Matt Lauer on the ""Today"" show went awry, he took to Twitter, writing, ""I wish Michael Jackson had twitter!!!!!! Maybe Mike could have explained how the media tried to set him up!!! It's all a fucking set up!!!!"" Like most everything else, Kanye may exaggerate the kinship, but it's real. And it's never more apparent than onÂ <i>Twisted Fantasy</i>, a blast of surreal pop excess that few artists are capable of creating, or even willing to attempt.<br/><br/>To be clear, Kanye West isÂ <i>not</i> Michael Jackson. As he told MTV last month, ""I do have a goal in this lifetime to be the greatest artist of all time, [but] that's very difficult being that I can't dance or sing."" He ended the thought with a laugh, but you get the impression he's not kidding. Unlike Michael, he's not interested in scrubbing away bits of himself-- his blackness, his candidness-- to appease the masses. And while Jackson's own twisted fantasies of paranoia and betrayal eventually consumed him whole, West is still aware of his illusions, though that mindfulness becomes increasingly unmoored with each newspaper-splashing controversy. The balance is tenuous, but right now it's working to his advantage. OnÂ <i>Twisted Fantasy</i>, Kanye is crazy enough to truly believe he's the greatest out there. And, about a decade into his career, the hardworking perfectionist has gained the talent on the mic and in the control room to make a startlingly strong case for just that.<br/><br/>Kanye's last album, 2008'sÂ <i>808s and Heartbreak</i>, was heavy on the Auto-Tune and stark synths, but relatively light on grandiose ideas. It was a necessary detour that expanded his emotional palette; a bloodletting after a harsh breakup and the passing of his mother that manifests itself inÂ <i>Twisted Fantasy</i>'s harshest lows. But musically, the new album largely continues where 2007'sÂ <i>Graduation</i> left off in its maximalist hip-hop bent, with flashes ofÂ <i>The College Dropout</i>'s comfort-food sampling andÂ <i>Late Registration</i>'s baroque instrumentation weaved in seamlessly. As a result, the record comes off like a culmination and an instant greatest hits, the ultimate realization of his strongest talents and divisive public persona. And since the nerd-superstar rap archetype he popularized has now become commonplace, he leaves it in the dust, taking his style and drama to previously uncharted locales, far away from typical civilization.<br/><br/>He's got a lot on his mind, too. After exiling himself for months following last year's infamous Taylor Swift stage bomb, the rapper made some of his first comeback appearances at the headquarters of Facebook and Twitter in late July. Videos of West standing on a table in tailored <i>GQ</i> duds while gesticulating through new rhymes (sans musical accompaniment) quickly made the rounds. The Silicon Valley visits seemed like a stunt, but they were prophetic. Forever an over-sharer, Kanye was looking for an outlet for his latest mirror-born musings. He found that platform with Twitter, and proceeded to dictate his own narrative in 140 character hits. Whether showing off exotic purchases, defending himself against the press, or going on stream-of-consciousness rants, Kanye finally had the middleman-free, instant-gratification platform he'd always wanted.<br/><br/>Juiced on the direct connection, he began releasing weekly songs for free online, the generosity of which would be moot if the songs didn't deliver. But they did, over and over, eventually building up the same type of superstar goodwill Radiohead pulled off with their pay-what-you-wantÂ <i>In Rainbows</i> release plan and Lil Wayne's free mixtape barrage leading up to 2008'sÂ <i>Tha Carter III</i>. So while Kanye can't sing or dance like Michael, he's making meaningful connections in a fresh, oftentimes (ahem) naked way. ""When I used to finish an album I would be so excited for my mom to hear the final - final!"" he wrote on November 11. ""The final - final is what we used to call the... completed album with all the skits!!! I made songs to please one person... MY MOM!!! I would think... would my my Mom like this song!""<br/><br/>I'm not sure which song he's talking about. Because, between July and November, West seemingly decided to makeÂ <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i> less mom-friendly and more of a hedonistic exploration into a rich and famous American id. At Facebook, he rapped the first verse of what would become album closer ""Lost in the World"", at one point changing Michael Jackson's ""Wanna Be Startin' Something"" refrain to, ""Mama-say mama-sah Mama Donda's son,"" referring to his late mother. The familial allusion was left off the album. Another Facebook tune-- a brutally oedipal account called ""Mama's Boyfriend""-- was also deleted, along with the vintage-Kanye-sounding ""See Me Now"". Such exclusions speak to the album's sharp focus-- to move everything forward while constantly tipping on the brink of frantic instability.</p>
<p>This isn't the same resourceful prodigy who madeÂ <i>The College Dropout</i> or even the wounded soul behindÂ <i>808s and Heartbreak</i>. Instead, Kanye'sÂ <i>Twisted Fantasy</i> incarnation cherry-picks little things from his previous work and blows them up into something less than sane. The expansive, all-encompassing nature of the album is borne out in its staggering guest list which includes mentors Jay-Z, RZA, and No ID, along with new charges like Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross, Kid Cudi, and Bon Iver's Justin Vernon. The inclusion of Minaj (who contributes the schizoid verse of her life on ""Monster""), Ross (a guy known for making up his own reality as he goes), and Cudi (who's probably even more wildly self-destructive than Kanye) especially adds to the hallucinatory tone. By the time Chris Rock shows up to provide comic relief during one of the album's bleakest moments, it begins to feel as if Kanye is stage-managing his own award show with enough starpower, shock, and dynamism to flatten the Grammys, the VMAs, and the rest all at once.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, Kanye has intermittently tried to flush away his rep as a boorish egoist in interviews and on Twitter, which is, fortunately, impossible. Because without his exploding self-worth-- itself a cyclical reaction to the self-doubt so much of his music explores-- there would be noÂ <i>Twisted Fantasy</i>. ""Every superhero needs his theme music,"" he says on ""POWER"", and though he's far from the virtuous paragons of comic book lore, he's no less complex. In his public life, he exhibits vulnerability and invincibility in equal measure, but he's just as apt at villainy-- especially here.</p>
<p>With ""Runaway"", he rousingly highlights his own douchebaggery, turning it into a rallying cry for all humanity. Like many of his greatest songs, it's funny, sad, and perversely relatable. And while the royal horns and martial drums of ""All of the Lights"" make it sound like the ideal outlet for the most over-the-top boasts imaginable, West instead inhabits the role of an abusive deadbeat desperate to make good on a million blown promises. ""Hell of a Life"" attempts to bend its central credo-- ""no more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need""-- into a noble pursuit. As a woofer-mulching synth line lurks, Kanye justifies his dreams of not sleeping with butÂ <i>marrying</i> a porn star, peaking with the combative taunt, ""How can you say they live they life wrong/ When you never fuck with the lights on."" Inspired by his two-year relationship with salacious model Amber Rose, the song blurs the line between fantasy and reality, sex and romance, love and religion, until no lines exist at all. It's a zonked nirvana with demons underneath; a fragile state that can't help but break apart on the very next song.</p>
<p>The haunted, Aphex Twin-sampling ""Blame Game"" bottoms out with a verse in which Kanye's voice is sped up, slowed down and stretched out. The effect is almost psychotic, suggesting three or four inner monologues fighting over smashed emotions. It's one of many moments on the record where West manipulates his vocals. Whether funneling some of his best-ever rhymes through a tinny, Strokes-like filter on ""Gorgeous"" or making himself wail like a dying cyborg in the final minutes of ""Runaway"", he uses studio wizardry to draw out his multitudes. Tellingly, though, he doesn't get the last word on the album. That distinction goes to the sobering tones of Gil Scott-Heron's 1970 spoken-word piece ""Comment #1"", a stark take on the American fable. ""All I want is a good home and a wife and children and some food to feed them every night,"" says Scott-Heron, bringing the fantasy to a close.</p>
<p>On ""POWER"", Kanye raps, ""My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts/ Reality is catching up with me, taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody."" The lines nail another commonality between the rapper and his hero. Like Michael, Kanye's behavior-- from the poorly planned outbursts to the musical brilliance-- is wide-eyed in a way that most 33 year olds have long left behind. That naivety is routinely battered onÂ <i>Twisted Fantasy</i>, yet it survives, better for the wear. With his music and persona both marked by a flawed honesty, Kanye's man-myth dichotomy is at once modern and truly classic. ""I can't be everybody's hero and villain, savior and sinner, Christian and anti Christ!"" he wrote earlier this month. That may be true, but he's more willing than anyone else to try.</p></div>"|14880.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14880-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy/|10.0|Ryan Dombal

Five years separated <i>Mezzanine</i> from <i>100th Window</i>, and then another seven elapsed before this year'sÂ <i>Heligoland</i>. They filled the gaps with soundtrack work, but when it comes to Massive Attack the pop group, their albums are still infrequent enough to be sold as events, built up by singles featuring remixes by artists that let the band add the flavor of the current moment, whether that's micro-house circa <i>100th Window</i> or spacey electronic disco circa now.</p>
<p>The problem is that, as events, these albums have fallen flat.  The remixes on the singles are usually more exciting, and certainly fresher, than the music Massive themselves have released in the 21st century. The band seems stuck in a holding pattern-- not quite as glibly self-parodic as Tricky but afraid to fully make themselves over like Portishead-- that's led to albums that sound just enough like Massive's classics not to feel totally burned and not quite different enough to justify listening to them over <i>Protection</i>. The sense of adventure is gone, the feeling that Massive not only could but <i>must</i> take their own music somewhere new. Best leave it to the younger, less resigned-to-their-sound artists to fill that feeling back in, as with the remix EP that added some unexpected angles to <i>Heligoland</i> earlier this year.</p>
<p>The <i>Atlas Air</i> EP doesn't feel quite as essential as that, but then the shtick-like ""Massive-style"" dread of <i>Heligoland</i> was often so bland that any little spark of invention felt like an improvement. Though there's a charity slant to this EP, it still feels like something snuck out near the end of the year to extend the album's life a bit. Even if the intentions were that crass, and I'm not saying they are, these remixes improve on the original ""Atlas Air"", which pulsed along soporifically on a slow-mo disco beat so by-the-numbers it was almost shameful. Tim Goldsworthy's rework turns it into truly cosmic dance music and Jneiro Jarel's makeover drops the tempo into a FlyLo/Brainfeeder trip-hop lurch, both filling in the clichÃ©d ""dark"" negative space of the original with bright waves of almost kraut-ish synth dissonance. They're actually eerie but also lovely, where the original felt like it was trying for both but not very hard.</p>
<p>In all cases, the remixers seem to have a better grasp on giving shape and drama to tracks via electronic texture than their benefactors do these days. That's doubly a shame considering Massive were once masters at the very same thing; even their instrumentals were memorable, thick and richly detailed and gorgeously skirting the line between dreamy and abrasive. None of the remixes on <i>Atlas Air</i> is mind-blowing-- they're passable-to-good by the standards the producers have set-- but they're definite improvements on the bare-bones original. Which probably proves little but how sadly comfortable Massive are now with just getting by, with letting their followers do the heavy lifting.</p></div>"|14881.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14881-atlas-air-ep/|5.0|Jess Harvell

Sledgehammer drums, cavernous bass, strangled guitar, and caged-animal cries fire up opener ""Teaching to Suffer"", then spend the next 24 grueling minutes wrestling for sonic space. Three albums in, AIDS Wolf's monastic commitment to brutal prog-punk and strident no wave has hardened their music from a rough lump of coal into a jagged diamond. In fact it's gotten so hard that few surprises can permeate it, but that shouldn't matter much to anyone already on their side.</p>
<p>Such unrelenting devotion gives the Montreal group a lot in common with the also-bludgeoning, also-questionably-named Brooklyn three-piece <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14216-cut-and-run/"">Child Abuse</a>. Both rely on non-stop effort and sonic demolition that steamrolls over indecision or subtlety. But I'll give a slight edge to AIDS Wolf because they've immersed themselves more completely into the form, like method actors sunk so far into roles that their craft is hard to detect. Prog-punk can often come off like an exercise-- musical weight-lifting that's more about dogmatic execution than listener engagement-- but here it sounds more inspired than clinical, less a stylistic choice than a calling.</p>
<p>Still, with their hammering beats and workman-like repetitions, AIDS Wolf can sound more like lumberjacks hacking at trees than musicians playing songs. What saves <i>March to the Sea</i> from being just a workout-- and distinguishes it from forefathers like Flying Luttenbachers (whose Weasel Walter mastered the album)-- is Chloe Lum's singing. A desperate scream mixed with a lunatic warble, her style could easily sound contrived. But she infuses it with a convincing humanity, much in the way Lydia Lunch fuses snotty put-on with harrowing emotion, or how John Brannon makes atonal howls feel melodic. Which is not to say Lum sounds like either of those singers. Her voice is unique, and at points-- like when she moans over Alex Moskos' neck-running riffs on ""Wet Winds""-- she turns lonely dismay into something oddly universal.</p>
<p>That track, like most of <i>March to the Sea</i>,<i> </i>is a sprint. But the album<i> </i>closes with a marathon-- a 10-minute cover of Throbbing Gristle's ""Very Friendly"". You might expect a change of pace here, but AIDS Wolf turn the original's detached sÃ©ance into a microcosm of the rest of the album. Apparently anything fed into their sonic blender comes out as the same grisly stew. For lots of groups that would be a shortcoming, but with AIDS Wolf the words ""monolithic"" and ""powerful"" are two sides of a coin-- one that they're getting better at endlessly flipping.</p></div>"|14876.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14876-march-to-the-sea/|6.9|Marc Masters

The charms of the genre coalesce once you adjust your frame of reference and recognize the value of its precarious yet carefree balancing act. Skeptics are frustrated by funky because it foils any attempt to define its development: Its aggressively percussive rhythmic experimentation never fully severs its ties with the comforting familiarity of house, and its MCs and divas refuse to entirely get out of the way and let the music do the work. They're also unwilling to replace their enthusiastic amateurism with the studied professionalism of the R&amp;B and rap whose blueprint they deface, leaving funky hesitant to join the ranks of grown-up genres.</p>
<p>But this immaturity is the music's greatest strength, placing it in a frozen moment before a series of ruinously limiting choices it might otherwise be required to make. So it sits between macho aggression and brazen seduction, between the accomplished and the gratifyingly disposable, between the firmly established provinces of the many genres (house, grime, dancehall, soca, broken beat, R&amp;B) it floats amongst and apart from. It's in keeping with this constant state of musical pre-pubescence that funky's appeals are shallowest on a track-by-track basis. Its magic emerges properly only in the context of the club or radio set, where the dueling interplay between one syncopated rhythm and the next, mediated through the MC, acts like two pens tracing a complex double-spirogram around the absent centre of the house groove, in a spontaneous balance of intricacy and symmetry.</p>
<p>To date, official mix compilations have failed fully to capture this vibe, in part due to the absence of MCs, but more generally by lacking the vibrant spontaneity that is so large a part of funky's appeal. Rinse's hedge-betting double-disc scene overview,Â <i>I Love Funky</i>, mixed by scene stalwarts Supa D and DJ MA1, certainly is no exception. But in its mostly successful rendering of funky's rhythmic adventurousness and stylistic range, it remains 2010's next best thing for curious listeners.</p>
<p>DJ MA1's disc relies heavily on over-compiled tracks from several years ago, and overall gives the impression of funky as little more than a local variant of an international house sound. The inclusion of funky's archetypal ""hard"" grime-influenced tune, Lil Silva's similarly aged ""Seasons"", is something of a too-blunt protest to the contrary. In his productions and radio sets, MA1 often seems disappointed that funky ever shifted away from its original polite adherence to the house template, and this air of future-fear hangs heavily over the mix, notwithstanding the high standard of most of the individual tracks. A shame, but if nothing else it provides a handy overview for the uninitiated.</p>
<p>By contrast, Supa D's strong (albeit predictable) track selection on his disc covers a satisfyingly broad and reasonably contemporary range of sounds and approaches. It moves from hi-tech syncopated pop (Funkystepz's ""For U"") to aggressive steroid-assisted dancehall (Geeneus and Ms. Dynamite's tense ""Get Low"") to stark, disorienting percussive works (DJ Naughty's ""Rhythm Dance""). Much of the fun lies in the journey from one state to the next, especially the regrettably brief periods in which the grooves coincide in messy, multi-tentacle clashes.</p>
<p>Funky's immaturity isn't facile: duo Ill Blu in particular have spent the last two years positioning themselves as perhaps the most expansive, forward-thinking producers currently operating in dance-pop. On their remix of Shystie's ""Pull It"", the bittersweet anthemism of the synth-horn and harpsichord arrangement belies a furious groove that seems to stagger and stumble like a galloping animal overcome by its own velocity. Still, the disc's most vibe-laden moment is also its simplest, with the Devine Collective's Mad One offering a pared down statement of funky's core principles on ""Housegirls Part 1"", barely more than a ratatat snare pattern, a ceaseless bass throb, and a delightful time-stretched ragga vocal ripped straight from jungle. In its gradual, relentless build of sensual friction from the sparest elements, it captures funky's appeal at its most elusive yet hard-hitting, not just an anthem but a frame of reference, a way of life.</p></div>"|14800.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14800-i-love-funky/|7.6|Tim Finney

Their first home, Postcard Records, had come and gone and left the band in the unfortunate position of having a stellar reputation based on material few could now hear. Everything they subsequently did was judged against those initial releases-- four lost singles which defined lovelorn, literate indie pop. Combined with their sputtering commercial fortunes, it gave Orange Juice an air of underachievement. Come the CD age and those first blasts of inspiration were well served-- compiled and recompiled, most recently on 2005's <i>The Glasgow School</i>. For most of the last decade it's been the group's later career that's fallen into shadow.</p>
<p>This is a band long defined by unavailability. But no more: New box set<i> Coals to Newcastle</i> isn't just a lavish retrospective, it's the complete Orange Juice. More complete than complete, in fact: As well as <i>The Glasgow School</i>, a radio sessions CD, and a DVD, each of the group's four albums gets an expanded disc to itself, which means the six-song <i>Texas Fever</i> is saddled with barely different alternate mixes. But most of the wealth of extra material is worth a play-- Orange Juice were never shy of throwing experiments onto B-sides, and tracks like ""Tongues Begin to Wag"" are droll sketches of their working process. The most treasurable rarity here, from a 1981 John Peel session, is ""Blokes On 45"", a medley of those early singles set to a faux-disco backbeat and a vision of proto-indie as an oldies' circuit variety turn.</p>
<p>That was the essence of Orange Juice: They were always self-conscious, and they were usually very funny. The former came with the post-punk territory-- at the end of the box set there's a radio interview where Edwyn Collins talks about being ""into"" something then chastises himself for sounding like a hippie. The latter was more unusual, but wit and self-deprecation are what links the jangle and rush of their first releases with the louche pop-soul precision of their final ones. That and Collins' immediately recognisable voice-- a plummy, permanently amused croon.</p>
<p>Collins was very cautious of pigeonholing-- he'd emerged talking about fusing pop and soul and then ended up sitting on the sidelines while the s-word became the era's most overused. He resisted the idea that Orange Juice's career was a steady progression towards slickness. But that's unavoidably what it sounds like. <i>You Can't Hide</i> and second album <i>Rip It Up</i> are full of spashy, amateurish collisions of pop, funk, indie, and latterly African sounds which somehow resolve into joy. But by the final, self-titled LP there's a muscle and poise on tracks like ""What Presence?!"" and ""Salmon Fishing in New York"" that's completely absent from the band's earlier work.</p>
<p>Collins' persona, and his love of melody and language, is what makes the contrast seem like a complement, not a trade-off. His killer lines are best discovered for yourself, but a common thread is his talent for picking up on the odd little idioms of everyday speech: ""Here's some mud in your pretty eye,"" ""Poor old soul."" It makes the songs at once more conversational and more articifial: At the end of ""Tenterhook"", his most smouldering song, he sings ""you tell me don't make any bones about it,"" and in the slow-burning context it sounds deliciously odd and curiously moving.</p>
<p><i>Coals to Newcastle</i> is studded with such moments-- the real test of the indie soulboy was how they managed at ballads, and like Scritti Politti's Green Gartside, Collins passed it. The slow numbers help to offset the non-stop wryness, but the indended audience for this box wouldn't have a problem with it in the first place. This isn't an introduction: If you're not sure about Orange Juice, pick up a compilation first. If you've acquired the taste, you'll adore this, and welcome the opportunity to rediscover the group's less influential but often delightful latter days.</p></div>"|14878.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14878-coals-to-newcastle/|8.6|Tom Ewing

The genre of course takes inspiration from dub and dancehall, but Martin highlights this more than his contemporaries, putting reggae elements up against low-end grime and the echoes of desolate urban soundscapes. His still-thrilling <i>London Zoo</i> from 2008 is the best example of this fusion and one of the defining LPs of dubstep's ascendancy. It's been a while since we've heard Martin in Bug form, though, and the genre has changed drastically since, splintering off into dozens of microgenres and regionally focused styles.</p>
<p>To reintroduce the project, Martin presents <i>Infected</i>, a double 12"" (basically an EP) that features two new cuts and two pretty high-profile remixes. The EP is intended as a bridge between <i>London Zoo</i> and his next full-length, which is being described as a ""dub battle"" between him and producer Adrian Sherwood, who's known for working with Lee ""Scratch"" Perry and early industrial acts like Cabaret Voltaire and Ministry. The two new songs here are both solid. ""Catch a Fire"", which features King Midas contributor Hitomi, is nice and woozy but essentially an extension of the blown-out downtempo shuffle already explored on KMS' <i>Waiting for You</i>.</p>
<p>""Tune In"", though, a collaboration with ragga-leaning rapper Roots Manuva, is a totally natural fit. The two are clearly kindred spirits, and Manuva's lithe toasting provides just the right contrast to Martin's grinding synth work. For the remixes, Martin makes some intriguing picks. Impressed by their epic 12-hour podcast earlier this year, he brought in out-techno OGs Autechre to redo ""Skeng"". A cool choice, but their brand of techy minimalism kind of saps the power out of the original. Hyperdub-affiliated newcomer Scratcha DVA, who turned heads with his wild ""<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VIn-1Kw1w4"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Natty</a>/Ganja"" 12"", gives ""Poison Dart"" a UK funky overhaul, adding in the quick stabs of hollow bass that are inherent to the genre.</p>
<p>Both of these remixes work more as interesting genre overlaps than dancefloor jams, and as for the latter, the jury's still out on whether funky will ever make a significant impact stateside. (If the Fives' should-be megahit <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOcefsTgbhE"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""It's What You Do""</a> doesn't do it, it kind of seems like nothing will.) It's also tough to gauge the impact of a release this short-- if anything it serves as a good reminder of the Bug's presence and reason to keep eyes on his next big release. These original tracks and reworks do suggest, though, that Martin is still very deep into his own thing. In dubstep, where the trend cycle produces so much stylistic crossover, that's a very valuable characteristic.</p></div>"|14877.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14877-infected-ep/|6.2|Joe Colly

Despite their difference in age, Nate and Roc's full-lengths share a few similarities: Both excel when working in juke's sonic braggadocio (Nate's ""Footwurk Homicide"", Roc's ""They Can't Fuck Wit Me"") and downtempo mood-setters (Roc's mesmerizing rework of Robin Thicke's ""Lost Without U"").

Roberts wasn't just dropping house music layups like piano chords and dubby textures; he was performing all manner of subtle and difficult moves, like budding noir atmosphere, pitch-shifted vocals-as-percussion, tension-massing tweaks. Roberts' productions are spellbindingly clear, crystal in their intent and focus.</p>
<p>There is something, then, almost inevitable about <i>Glass Eights</i>, Roberts' debut album for his Dial records. It opens with a shattered piano note and a pattering drum; one minute later, when a tiny vocal sample and electric keyboards drop ""Lesser"" into a well-paced groove, Roberts provides that rare moment in which both bobbing your head and shrugging your shoulders are appropriate reactions.  Simultaneously: ""This is excellent,"" and, ""We knew he could do this.""  Roberts chose to emphasize his compositional skills on <i>Glass Eights</i>. Pianos, violins, and lithe beats rule the tracks, which never seem to stir with overeager rhythms or combust into white noise. There are times when the whole can seem less than the sum of its parts. ""Porcelain"" features bright, ordered drum patterns, a funny little modular synth melody, and an out-of-nowhere steel drum interlude; the total is passable techno. Six minutes of it.</p>
<p>Still, there are only a handful of producers capable of <i>Glass Eights</i>. Sometimes Roberts seems like he's trying to stimulate his tracks solely via the overtones of his chords; call it harmonic house. On cuts like ""Pruned"" and ""Ever or Not"" he searches for the midway point between Carl Craig and Philip Glass, the variety provided by listening to determine on which side he errs. Elsewhere he delights in dispensing with one of deep house's go-to signifers-- ""warm""-- and sends his tracks out to shiver until they seem austere (""Interlude [Telephone]"" and ""Navy Blue"").</p>
<p>Dance music enthusiasts are really good at asking one question (""Can [hot artist X] possibly keep this up?!"") but predictably poor at asking another: ""What will it mean if he does?"" <i>Glass Eights</i> shyly defers by focusing on a slightly more musically nuanced type of electronic music than Roberts' previous work. It is impossible to call a failure and equally difficult to pinpoint its vigor.</p></div>"|14861.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14861-glass-eights/|7.2|Andrew Gaerig

Virtually every song wedded woozy or bouncy maximalist synth lines to bashy, blown-out drumbeats. Within this bargain-store pomp, Hart would paradoxically bury his most painstaking and precise creations, his lyrics, which were filled with enough complex and internal rhymes to make Cole Porter proud.</p>
<p>You'd be forgiven for wishing that Hart would at least slightly broaden his scope, but then again his albums each take up little more than 30 minutes-- long enough to enjoy his distinctive approach without growing sick of its rigidity. Perhaps he also thought a nice long break <i>between</i> Russian Futurists full-lengths would engender goodwill as well, and so after five years without a proper studio effort, Hart returns with <i>The Weight's on the Wheels</i>. And... not a whole lot has changed. It's hard to fault Hart, as <i>Wheels</i> is another thoroughly pleasurable album that proves his skills as a popsmith haven't rusted.</p>
<p>Though it doesn't affect the quality of the songs, there is one major difference between this Russian Futurists record and preceding releases: Hart has deigned to push his vocals much further up in the mix this time around, so you don't need a lyric sheet to make out his cleverly knotty, densely alliterative rhymes. As always, the dominant subject is romantic struggle and dissatisfaction, and Hart maintains his tendency to prize sound over sense in a way that might be irritating if he weren't so damn good at it. ""Let's serve this nervousness on a plate/ Let's curb our words for impervious debates,"" goes an entirely representative couplet. That's not to say Hart can't be relatably affecting-- ""Golden Years"" finds him musing, ""Drank my way through my twenties... Slept my way through my thirties,"" while ""To Be Honest""
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
hinges on the slippery, shifting meanings of the refrain, ""I don't even know what it's like/ To be honest.""</p>
<p>Hart does manage to tweak his tried-and-true formula, albeit slightly, to help keep things interesting. ""One Night, One Kiss"", a duet with Heavy Blinkers vocalist Ruth Minnikin, treats sex with a frankness and joy that's always welcome in indie's less-than-lubricious environs. Meanwhile, the back-to-back pair ""Register My Firearms? No Way!"" and ""100 Shopping Days 'Til Christmas"" both subtly inject R&amp;B touches, the former by way of a sample, the latter with a hook reminiscent of the Junior Boys. <i>Wheels</i> starts to lose a bit of steam toward its end, but as with previous Russian Futurists albums, it's over well before Hart's shtick turns monotonous.</p></div>"|14867.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14867-the-weights-on-the-wheels/|7.5|Joshua Love

On stationery flipped upside down, Owens scribbled enthusiastically that this EP was their (timely) way of giving thanks to listeners who've showered the San Francisco duo with love and support since <i>Album</i>, their lemons-to-lemonade debut, which arrived last September. While insisting that his band's latest isn't the sound of them ""all grown up,"" he described the six songs enclosed as a ""LETTER OF INTENT,"" a ""SNAPSHOT OF THE HORIZON,"" and a ""step up"" from its stunning predecessor.</p>
<p>Girls have grown a lot in the past year. All that time on the road together has provided them with ample opportunity to develop into a tight, fire-breathing <i>band</i>.Â That's exactly how they sound here: serious and totally devoted to their craft, despite their image as drug-addled scabs.Â <i>Album</i>'s handmade production values were often overlooked-- bloodshot at just the right moments, polished thoughtfully in others, haunting at every turn. But this time out, bassist/producer Chet ""JR"" WhiteÂ <i>really</i> goes for it, letting every flourish and lick sing without sacrificing any of the strung out, open-armed spirit with which he and Owens take to updating American rock'n'roll standards. Whether it's the whammy bar ripples on its title track, the hot flare of horns in the opener, or even the stereo panning on ""Heartbreaker"", White's work here frames and accentuates the curves of these songs in ways that elevate them all.Â Those, too, continue to devastate.</p>
<p>We know from interviews and reviews alike that Owens' back story is big enough to swallow just about any young band. But because of the connective strength of his songwriting, it never did. Singles like ""Lust for Life"" and ""Hellhole Ratrace"" transcended and outlasted that initial ruckus: The celebration Owens spun from the sadness in them was something that could be shared, even if his past could put him at an almost alien distance. He has a natural command of his hooks and confessionals, a gift that's only acquired more compelling shades with time. Take the clarity in his promise of ""rock'n'roll, out of control"" on ""Substance"" as just one example, or seconds later, as he coolly announces a guitar solo just before it's set loose. They're simple enough, but both jump right off the recording.  Elsewhere, lines like those of the aforementioned title track still cut straight to marrow. Over lonesome chords and a few distant strips of pedal steel, Owens hangs his head, ""I know you feel like I did, too/ And even though I'm close to you/ I can't be what you need/ Because, you're just as lost as me."" As a frontman, Owens has discovered a swagger that matches the deep reserves of melancholy in his voice.</p>
<p>This is still undeniably sad, unsettling music. On flirty opener ""Thee Oh So Protective One"", Owens serenades the insecurities of a teenage girl. ""He'll never know about the times that you cried in your bedroom,"" he croons. ""About the times that you cried in your classroom/ About your mother or your father or the way you got your broken heart."" It's one of several hearts breaking here, though ""Heartbreaker"" showcases the improvement in songwriting best, Owens and White continuing to take the love song template they adore and skew it to their liking. Everything just clicks: its simple, elegant construction, its velvety feel, the way its hopelessly lonesome vocal hook washes over Owens' friendly chord progression. Girls may be only a few releases deep, but those chords sound like theirs alone.</p>
<p>And yet, as much as <i>Broken Dreams Club</i> feels like an improvement upon <i>Album</i> both in songwriting and production, this release is clearly about looking forward. The psychedelic haze of ""Carolina"" is the closest they've come to sonically uncapping the pills they've been known to romanticize. It's a wild hybrid of a song that's intent on stretching out, its opening layer of evil, crying guitar taking on heaps of gauze before ultimately vaulting into a rowdy, bar-band outro at about the six-and-a-half minute mark.Â In that same letter that promised growth and focus, Owens also said something quite striking in thanks. ""All of us have something to say and give and this is what happens when we show a little interest and support in others."" If <i>Broken Dreams Club</i> is indeed an honest glimpse of what's ahead, it sounds as though Girls have much more to give.</p></div>"|14870.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14870-broken-dreams-club-ep/|8.7|David Bevan

CyHi Da Prince excepted, West's taste in musicians is usually sound, and CuDi is talented. His taste for forlorn melody, chilly electronics, and empty space basically brought <i>808s and Heartbreak</i> into existence, and his fingerprints are visible all over Kanye's upcoming <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.</i> As a member of Kanye's revolving door of creative inspiration, he has proven himself to be indispensable.</p>
<p>As a solo artist, well... his second full-length, <i>Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager</i> manages to render the jury still out. His 2009 debut, <i>Man on the Moon: The End of the Day</i>, was a modest commercial success but a mortifying creative face-plant,  a compilation of the most two-dimensional art-school-kid clichÃ©s (I'm sad, I'm stoned, I'm <i>deep</i>) imaginable, over unrelievedly monotonous electro tracks.  It was hard to find a more self-satisfied and less likable pop record that year. <i>Man on the Moon II</i>, the sequel, is still a bumpy listen, but it tweaks his formula enough to at least hint at the massive promise Kanye sees in him.</p>
<p>First, and most crucially, he perks up the tempo a little. After <i>Man on the Moon</i> came out, CuDi told MTV.com that his next album was ""gonna be the complete opposite of what <i>Man on the Moon</i> was. <i>Man on the Moon</i> was so serious. This one is gonna be more playful and fun. It's about having a good time."" It's not, really, unless he's referring to all his dead-eyed bragging about how fucked-up he's capable of getting. But the music is brighter: ""Erase Me"" is a chugging guitar-rock song with a big, slick chorus that could have sat comfortably on late-90s alt-rock radio. (It also features a Kanye verse that ends with a ridiculous ""diarrhea"" pun.) On ""REVOFEV"", he dispenses aw-shucks big-brother wisdom like, ""Things might get tough/ No need to stress,"" over a tumble of piano chords and acid-rock guitar.</p>
<p>Even his trademark sadface stuff, though, is more fully realized. ""Don't Play This Song"" starts with a somber, harmonically rich string quartet and adds a throbbing pulse and a wailing Mary J. Blige; the track's elements shift slowly and subtly, giving the groove a fluid and hypnotic feel that Cudi echoes with his stuttering ""ra-ra-ra-ra-right"" delivery.Â CuDi's lyrics, though, still carry a wince-inducing ""Bill and Ted"" ring to them. The chorus of ""Don't Play This Song"" goes: ""Wanna know what I sound like when I'm not on drugs?/ Please, please don't play this song,"" which I would feel comfortable interpreting as pure comedy if he didn't say, ""I love the dark, maybe we can make it darker/ Give me a marker,"" in dead earnest on ""Maniac"", a song that gathers a St. Vincent sample, CuDi, and emo-rapper Cage in the same room for probably the first and last time.</p>
<p>Thematically, <i>Mr. Rager</i> is most compelling when it leaves behind moping alone in your room for moping while you're out on the town-- being a coked-up asshole. CuDi's blank, artless affect makes a more interesting vehicle for these semi-poisonous sentiments: ""Hide the pain with some pussy and mimosas,"" he mutters on ""Wild'N Cuz I'm Young"". The only true biographical detail we get on <i>Mr. Rager</i> hints at his troubled family-- ""I wish I could tell my brother/ Something for motivation to get him out that gutter/ He's leaving behind a family and a mother"" (""Mojo So Dope"")-- and also provides a glimpse of what CuDi's music might sound like if he provided actual emotional content instead of just gesturing repeatedly towards it.</p></div>"|14875.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14875-man-on-the-moon-ii-the-legend-of-mr-rager/|6.7|Jayson Greene

A very good singer, a pretty good guitar player, a fine songwriter, a canny reader of the zeitgeist, he was a fixture on the Chicago soul scene on and off for decades. He made the R&amp;B charts 19 times over the years, but never really broke through to a pop audience. His records are mostly out of print, his big numbers all but forgotten-- although he did apparently make a killing from all the hip-hop records that sampled Morris Jennings' breakbeat and Minnie Riperton's giggle from his 1967 single ""Different Strokes"".</p>
<p>So the Numero Group's comprehensive box set of Johnson's 1959-1971 material is a labor of love-- four CDs, packaged with six LPs of the same material and an extensive booklet, drawn from releases on half dozen or so labels and encompassing a bit of unreleased material, too. This isn't even the full career survey its title implies; more than half of his 19 R&amp;B hits happened after the period documented here, the bulk of them on Hi Records, where he was effectively the second-tier Al Green. (His only Top-10 R&amp;B hit was a cover of Green's ""Take Me to the River"".) It's a tribute to a local guy who really made good only long after the fact.</p>
<p>""Something is holding me back"", Johnson sang on one of his most potent songs. ""Is it because I'm black?"" Well, of course-- and he addressed racism pretty directly on some of his 1969-1970 recordings. But that wasn't what was holding him back within the R&amp;B context, at least not directly. He spent most of the era covered here on tiny Chicago independent labels that didn't have any other big acts, most famously Twilight, aka Twinight, in which he was a shareholder. A lot of his mid-60s material was indifferently recorded at best. He didn't have a consistent band on record the way most hitmakers of his era did, although he did work with some good ones. (He recorded a handful of these songs in Memphis with the first-rate band who'd later back him up at Hi, including the hit ""Dresses Too Short"", whose attitude
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
is very much of its time: ""Just because I whistle at you/ You say that I'm doin' you wrong/ Why do you blame me, baby?/ I didn't tell you to put it on."")</p>
<p>The broader problem, though, was that he was a totally solid talent in an era of greatness, a deft trendspotter in a period of nonstop innovation. He was a hard shouter, but not quite as hard as Wilson Pickett or James Brown; he was funny, but not as funny as Joe Tex, whose ""Skinny Legs and All"" he answered with ""I'll Take Those Skinny Legs"". Despite the liner notes' questionable argument that 1970's <i>Is It Because I'm Black</i> was ""the first black concept album,"" he wasn't a conceptualist-- he was a hit-chaser.</p>
<p>And sometimes he got there: ""Come on Sock it to Me"", ""Concrete Reservation"", the Donny Hathaway-arranged ""One Way Ticket to Nowhere"". The market actually did lift up his best material. (The only really essential non-hit here is a long, spark-spitting funk workout, ""Right On"", in which he shouts out the Pieces of Peace, the best Chicago band he got to work with.) If you're looking for an introduction to Johnson's pre-Hi era, the single-disc <i>Chicago Twinight Soul</i> is a lot more compact, and hits almost all of the peaks. What's most interesting about <i>Complete Mythology</i>, though, is the distance between the best stuff and everything else-- the context that shows what it took for a hard-working, deeply independent-minded R&amp;B singer to try to break through at a time when a hit could come from anywhere.</p></div>"|14822.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14822-complete-mythology/|6.8|Douglas Wolk

The title is very appropriate. The piece sounds frigid and remote, with layers of grim synthesizer tones implying some impossibly dark, endless frozen landscape. When the vocals come in, they're warmly human and overtly sexy. The two members of the group, Giorgia Angiuli and Piero Fragola, alternate their parts-- he's breathy and intense, she's assertive but serene. They never overlap, but they sound as if they could be tangled together, and face to face. The intimacy of their performance is exaggerated by its contrast with the chilly electronic tones of the track. If you can imagine Ladytron mimicking the sexual tension and minimalism of the xx, you're more than halfway there. It's a very evocative and impressive song.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the rest of the album isn't quite so profound. The Italian duo doesn't stray too far from the tone established by ""Ice Lips"", but their songs are hit-or-miss. Their best compositions are sexy and catchy, albeit in rather understated and introverted ways. ""Even If"", one of the album's highlights, sets a simple, repetitive sing-song melody against a moody guitar figure that wouldn't sound out of place on an Interpol record, resulting in a stealthy earworm of a hook. ""Escape Destination"" and ""No Train No Plane"" are similarly subtle, burying reasonably strong melodic motifs in atmosphere and ambience. They fall short when they lean too hard on setting a mood. Much of the album is indistinct and forgettable, drifting by in a haze of plinking beats and bleeping keyboard notes. The mood being evoked is nondescript and typical of a lot of good-not-great 00s electronica-- vaguely melancholy, sorta uptight, overly serious. The tracks that go too far in this direction, like ""Cruise Control"" and ""White March"", are the flip side of ""Ice Lips"". Instead of sounding intimate and specific, they are aloof and abstract.</p>
<p>It should be noted that a significant part of We Love's project involves fashion, and performances in which the two dress up in futuristic costumes. Of course, this aspect of their art is totally lost on record. Without having witnessed one of these performances, it's hard to say whether or not this adds anything to the music. However, just looking at photographs of the costumes, it's obvious that they are doing something sort of interesting. The suits have a familiar style derived from sci-fi movies and comic books, but intriguingly, everything you would expect to appear hard and rigid looks soft and flowing. Patterns appear where you would expect blank space. Cozy, pajama-esque fabric is contrasted with what appears to be pleather or latex. In some ways, their approach to visual presentation is the opposite of their approach to music. Whereas they go against convention in their costumes, their songs tend to be fairly generic electronic music, pretty much exactly what you would expect from something put out by Bpitch Control. They certainly have the skill to rise above unchallenging aural wallpaper; they do it at least four times on this record. It's just too bad they couldn't have been more consistent on this album.</p></div>"|14872.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14872-we-love/|5.6|Matthew Perpetua

While invoking the names of both a long-running, well-respected, uncompromising underground group and an up-and-coming performer is a great way to sell prospective listeners on an unknown project, it's not really accurate as far as what Former Ghosts is. The best way to think of Former Ghosts is as the newest work from the man previously known as This Song Is a Mess But So Am I, a one-man group created by Ruppert as a coping mechanism for the untimely death of his mother. As A Mess, Ruppert offered listeners a Casio-tonic take on Xiu Xiu's caustic and restless aggression, coupled with vocals that either paid slavish homage to Ian Curtis or adopted the fragile quiver found in Conor Oberst's more vulnerable moments. For better or worse, the music made as A Mess often lived up to the name of the project, coming off like a primal scream therapy session set to noise. Clearly Ruppert wasn't interested in creating music listeners could enjoy as innocuous background noise; he aimed to be a provocateur, creating sonics that matched his own inner turmoil.</p>
<p>Former Ghosts started in part as an excuse for Ruppert and Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart to hang out and make synth-pop together; Nika Roza Danilova (aka Zola Jesus), whose work Ruppert admired (and vice versa) entered the fold soon thereafter. There's a definite edge to <i>New Love</i> that feels distinctive; the drum machine hits and synth stabs have a five o'clock shadow showing beneath their New Romantic veneer. The less-than-flattering fidelity helps in that regard as well, presenting the image of new wave as conducted through the Tesla coils and Van de Graaff generators in a mad scientist's laboratory. In the hands of his charismatic guest vocalists-- for <i>New Love</i>, Danilova and Tearist's Yasmine Kittles-- these backing tracks come to life (when Jamie Stewart sings, it's in a back-up role). On her two turns at the mic, Danilova doesn't sing so much as dominate, her forceful vocals laying waste to whatever's in their path. Kittles, a type of singerÂ decidedly differentÂ from Danilova, takes another approach on her two tracks: She emits intermittent whispers and hisses like a subjugated trip-hop diva, instead letting the music take precedence.</p>
<p>Given Ruppert's past predilection for dramatic singing, one would think his vocals would be a perfect match for these backing tracks. Unfortunately, he often doesn't rise to the challenge. The duet he performs with Kittles on ""Winter's Year"" bears this out; where she sounds at ease and at home, Ruppert seems to be fighting against himself to get the words out. On aggressive tracks like ""The Days Will Get Long Again"", his Oberst-esque warbling gets subsumed by the hum and spark of the backing track. During more contemplative sections (like the beginning of ""Winter's Year""), his singing smothers any prettiness in the instrumentals. Unabashed pop tunes like ""And When You Kiss Me"" and ""Right Here"" need a gentler touch than Ruppert's tin-can singing can provide, while dirges (such as the appropriately titled ""Bare Bones"") are actually undercut by his tendency to overemote.</p>
<p>It seems crass to suggest that Ruppert is a better singer when his songs aren't very song-like, or when he's more interested in screaming than singing. But with two albums as Former Ghosts complete, he hasn't yet hit on tracks that mesh well with his vocal style. Given the success he's had when other people take over vocal duties, it'd be interesting to see what would happen if he invited other like-minded (or oppositely-minded) people to sing his songs across an entire album, Ã Â la Stephin Merritt's the 6ths. Unfortunately, as things stand, the errors of omission in most Former Ghosts news stories are appropriate: Freddy Ruppert is the frontman of a group better served when someone else is center stage.</p></div>"|14851.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14851-new-love/|5.3|David Raposa

There's a 2xCD, 3xLP set that contains 22 unreleased songs from the period, and then there's a deluxe box set that augments the unreleased material with a remastered version of <i>Darkness</i> and three DVDs. And the latter is housed in a faux spiral-bound notebook with facsimiles of Springsteen's handwritten studio notes from the time. Taken all together, we're talking 10 hours plus of video and audio, along with the booklet. So calling this a reissue of <i>Darkness on the Edge of Town</i> is not accurate. This is a trove, a vast clearinghouse from a fertile period, the product of which turned out to be one terrific album. And in addition to containing its share of treasure, <i>The Promise</i> ultimately confirms that Springsteen is a brilliant editor of his own material.</p>
<p>That much is clear when listening to the album itself, which is in danger of being overshadowed by everything released around it. Where the <i>Born to Run</i> box from 2005 looked intently at the album proper (there were few outtakes from those sessions anyway) and portrayed what resulted as a landmark, <i>The Promise</i> focuses on a period of time that produced one memorable album but could have produced others. Much of the material was written when Springsteen was embroiled in a lawsuit with his former manager, and a lot has been made of the impact the legal proceedings were said to have on Springsteen's muse. He made a bleak and bombed-out album, the story goes, because he was feeling lost in the world himself, fearful that he was losing control of his career. And since the lawsuit kept him out of the studio when he wanted so badly to record, he kept piling up songs while he waited for the smoke to clear.</p>
<p>Even more than the lawsuit, <i>Darkness</i> seems like Springsteen's instinctive recoil from the <i>Born to Run</i> hype. That's partly why he burned to cut another record-- to ""find out what he's got,"" to quote a line from ""Badlands"" that particularly appealed to him. <i>The Promise</i> documentary included with the box, which combines black-and-white video footage taken in the studio while the album was recorded with recent interviews, makes clear that he wanted to make an ""honest"" record that people would take seriously. He was embarrassed by the hype that had put him on the cover of <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> simultaneously in 1975, and he didn't want to be the ""next big thing.""</p>
<p>Indeed, it's striking just how different <i>Darkness</i> is from its predecessor in tone and theme. Where <i>Born to Run</i> was about drama, with a sense of bombast that pushed past cinematic and wound up somewhere closer to Broadway, <i>Darkness</i>, despite its share of rockers, is about grim acceptance and pressing on in the face of doubt. In ""Racing in the Street"", the bittersweet ballad that ranks with the best songs Springsteen has ever written, the narrator's girlfriend ""Stares off alone into the night/ With the eyes of one who hates for just being born."" But she's not going anywhere. The darkness that envelops the town keeps the characters in and the rest of the world out. Where the characters in <i>Born to Run</i> were racing against death, the characters here are cursed with the burden of survival. So like all Springsteen records in the early part of his career, there are many songs about cars and driving, but these people seem to be going in circles, idly moving from one place to the next. ""You can ride this road 'til dawn, without another human being in sight,"" goes a line in the richly emotional mid-tempo rocker ""Something in the Night"". With no chance of escape, you have to figure out how to deal with what's in front of you.</p>
<p>The stark reality of the songs is reinforced by the album's production. <i>Darkness</i> is in its own way as sonically consistent and coherent as <i>Born to Run</i>; but where that album drew inspiration from Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, <i>Darkness</i> tries to do as much as possible with a minimum of embellishment. A few tracks break from this dry and barren template. ""Candy's Room"" and ""Something in the Night"" have the tinkling piano and glockenspiel that might have helped them to fit on <i>Born to Run</i>, while ""Racing in the Street"" has a very particular and hugely effective atmosphere, with just the right touches of reverb and backing vocals to make it sound like an elegy. As for the remastering, I'm not hearing a lot of difference here, but <i>Darkness</i> always sounded good. From the opening drum fill of ""Badlands"" to the grim fade of the title track, there's not a weak song on the album and it deservedly ranks with Springsteen's classics. Which means that it ranks with rock's classic albums, full stop.</p>
<p>And it took a long time to get it that way. The music on the 2xCD set <i>The Promise</i>, which was written during the <i>Darkness</i> sessions, shows what Springsteen had to leave behind to get the record that he wanted. That meant no big pop songs. There's ""Because the Night"", given to Patti Smith before being completed, which she then improved and turned into her biggest hit. And then ""Fire"", which Springsteen gave to the Pointer Sisters, and which went to No. 2 on Billboard. It also means no songs about easy times, hope, and escape. So ""Gotta Get That Feeling"", an appealing mid-tempo track with horns and sweet backing vocals and lines like ""We ain't got no money but we don't care"" was shelved. (In <i>Darkness</i>, people have no money but they do care, <i>a lot</i>.) And ""Save My Love"", a catchy piano-led tune, isn't going to make <i>Darkness</i> with lines like ""If we open up our hearts/ Love won't forsake us."" Tell that to the couple in ""Racing in the Street"".</p>
<p><i>The Promise</i> is also a good demonstration of how Springsteen mines his unused songs for material, and shows how many ways he tried to record things before figuring out how they worked best. The set kicks off with ""Racing in the Street ('78)"", a version that begins as an austere ballad but builds into a rock song. It's nowhere near as effective as what came to be on the record, but it is riveting, showing just how elastic Springsteen's melodic and thematic ideas could be. An early version of ""Candy's Room"" is here, too, and it's called ""Candy's Boy""; instead of the original's dark and explosive sensuality, here it's a clean, shuffling guitar-pop tune, charming but without a lot at stake.</p>
<p>The tracks on <i>The Promise</i> CD aren't left out just because of subject matter or tone-- they also sound different. As with some songs on <i>Tracks</i>, some of these songs had parts added later. ""Where needed, I worked on them to bring them to fruition,"" Springsteen writes in the notes. ""Many stand as they were recorded all those years ago."" The re-touching is at its most extreme on ""Save My Love"", which was written in the 70s but cut in 2010. In other places, the vocals and music sound fundamentally different from the recordings of the era. Certainly, the arrangements are thicker than what wound up on <i>Darkness</i>, which makes sense since some of the songs left behind were R&amp;B-based bar-band songs and swooning songs of love and lust. Still, despite the lack of consistency, the 22 new songs (there are 21 tracks, but ""The Way"" is a hidden bonus track at the end) are mostly very good and occasionally great. None feel like they should have been on <i>Darkness</i>, but almost all of them hold up to repeat plays and stand on their own as very good Springsteen-- easily on the level of mid-level stuff on <i>The River</i>, say.</p>
<p>On the visual side, one DVD has a bizarre recording of Springsteen and the E Street Band playing <i>Darkness on the Edge of Town </i>straight through in an empty theater in Asbury Park in December 2009. I suspect that this decision was inspired in part by the notion that the album is about loneliness and open spaces, but there's something off about seeing this band, known so well for its deep connection to its audience, playing by themselves in a large room without people.</p>
<p>More interesting on the same disc are the live odds-and-ends from rehearsals at Springsteen's rented Jersey home in the 70s. The band is packed into what looks like a small bedroom, Springsteen is shirtless, with the familiar guitar around his neck, standing before a microphone taped to a stand. And the band is running through a couple new songs in an intimate space with no sense at all of posterity. (They are so casual, Steve Van Zant isn't even wearing a hat!) Also on this disc are songs from a 1978 show in Phoenix, including the famous clip for ""Rosalita"" that got some play in the early days of MTV.  These Phoenix performances are generally superior to the three-hour set from a 1978 show in Houston included on a separate DVD. The video comes from the arena's video feed and, given the quality of video in 1978, quality could be better. But it is a multi-camera shoot with good coverage and Springsteen and the E Street band were in amazing form throughout that year. So no complaints about more live Springsteen.</p>
<p>Which leaves the documentary, which in one sense serves as the centerpiece of the project. As with the film included with the <i>Born to Run</i> box, there are interesting details about the technical aspects of the album. Chuck Plotkin's theory behind his approach to mixing vocals is fascinating, and explains why this album feels so balanced. We see fragments of songs, lots of exhaustion and sitting around, and get a look at how Springsteen works as a bandleader. There's a moment in the first scene where he looks tired and frustrated and a little pissed off and you realize that it would be scary to have him mad at you. He's not always an easy guy to work for. It's refreshing to see such a simple display of humanity when the documentary obviously has very specific points that it wants to hit.</p>
<p>Still, there's something odd about these ""making of"" documentaries about albums coming from the artist themselves. In part because they seem so intent on directing how the music is heard. Sets like this and Neil Young's <i>Archives</i> reflect a desire for artists to take control of their legacy and shape the narrative of their careers. It's easy to understand this impulse, and doubly so when you are talking about people as controlling as Springsteen or Neil Young. And yet it's also futile. As listeners, our stories are what will ultimately matter, and by having the music in our lives, we give it significance and form. <i>Darkness</i> is the kind of record you sink into, an album of power and dignity and loss and just a hint at the possibility of transcendence, which is something Springsteen's fans have known all along, even without hearing a single detail of how it is made. We'll take it all and have loads of fun exploring all the ephemera, but Springsteen carved through all this-- the pile of songs, the legal bullshit, the media image he wasn't comfortable with-- to make that one magical record, which is the most impressive part of it all.</p></div>"|14869.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14869-the-promise-the-darkness-on-the-edge-of-town-story-the-promise/|9.5|Mark Richardson

There's a 2xCD, 3xLP set that contains 22 unreleased songs from the period, and then there's a deluxe box set that augments the unreleased material with a remastered version of <i>Darkness</i> and three DVDs. And the latter is housed in a faux spiral-bound notebook with facsimiles of Springsteen's handwritten studio notes from the time. Taken all together, we're talking 10 hours plus of video and audio, along with the booklet. So calling this a reissue of <i>Darkness on the Edge of Town</i> is not accurate. This is a trove, a vast clearinghouse from a fertile period, the product of which turned out to be one terrific album. And in addition to containing its share of treasure, <i>The Promise</i> ultimately confirms that Springsteen is a brilliant editor of his own material.</p>
<p>That much is clear when listening to the album itself, which is in danger of being overshadowed by everything released around it. Where the <i>Born to Run</i> box from 2005 looked intently at the album proper (there were few outtakes from those sessions anyway) and portrayed what resulted as a landmark, <i>The Promise</i> focuses on a period of time that produced one memorable album but could have produced others. Much of the material was written when Springsteen was embroiled in a lawsuit with his former manager, and a lot has been made of the impact the legal proceedings were said to have on Springsteen's muse. He made a bleak and bombed-out album, the story goes, because he was feeling lost in the world himself, fearful that he was losing control of his career. And since the lawsuit kept him out of the studio when he wanted so badly to record, he kept piling up songs while he waited for the smoke to clear.</p>

For one thing, it's just seemed inevitable, as many indie bands would at some point ditch dance-punk for neo-grunge. But also we're just plain greedy to re-own some hard-to-find tunes from the era when sampling and Roland synthesizers changed the sound of radio almost overnight.</p>
<p>And in the last few years, newer acts, from Scandinavian indie pop bands to UK house producers, many of whom were kids at the time have begun to pay homage to early rave in earnest. <i>Impossible Oddities</i> collects the psychedelic pop-dance singles the Orb and their sampladelic friends released on the duo's W.A.U!. Mr Modo label as the UK's late-80s ""Summer of Love"" gave way to the worldwide rave boom of the early 90s. If dubstep has recently picked up on early breakbeat hardcore's manic roughness, this is stuff you can hear referenced in the trippy-but-cuddly rave recreations of the Tough Alliance axis.</p>
<p>Elements of R&amp;B (Johnson Dean's chintzy, cheesy, pretty great ""Somebody Somewhere"") and reggae (Indica All Stars' ""Open Our Eyes"") and prog-rock (the nature-sounds overload heard on an early demo mix of the Orb's ""Little Fluffy Clouds"") crop up throughout. But mostly these producers were working in idioms that were, for a few years anyway, totally new: Chicago acid, the sample-heavy party records of early instrumental hip-hop, Detroit techno. To these import sounds, theÂ W.A.U!. Mr ModoÂ artists brought a very UKÂ neo-hippie vibe. The track titles and producer monikers alone should give you give you an idea of the angle many of these artists (especially the Orb, informing the whole project) were working: ""Ashram House"", ""Tripping on Sunshine"", Sun Electric, Indica All Stars.</p>
<p>Not quite right for one of Orb mainman Dr. Alex Paterson's legendary chill-out nights, but usually too whimsical for a frenzied warehouse rave, these artists operated during a brief time when it was still possible to exist somewhere in the middle. It's stoner music with a funky pulse and none of the bad-trip vibes of the harder, faster music of just a few years (or months) later. Compared to the crassest pop-dance stuff of the time-- think the huge riffs and learn-in-a-minute raps of Technotronic-- they practically have the grownup restraint of deep house. But there's still an appealing rave-minded roughness and lack of pretension to the tracks on <i>Impossible Oddities</i>.</p>
<p>Not all of it's essential; there are a few too many interchangeable break-plus-synth tunes that were probably little more than DJ fodder even at the time. That's to be expected since this is a specific snapshot of one label's output. But if you've been digging the way the neo-Balearic boom has been getting rave-ier recently-- think artists like Azari &amp; III and Tensnake-- here's a nice, unexpected opportunity to catch the original vibe without resorting to lo-fi YouTube rips.</p></div>"|14866.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14866-impossible-oddities/|6.0|Jess Harvell

Considering the blown-out beatmaker's visual fetish for pornography and disturbing images, that might seem faulty, but this isn't music you reach out and touch-- it practically swarms your senses, and you don't get much of a chance to get out of its way. Tobacco's main outfit, Black Moth Super Rainbow, laid the template for this synth-smothered sound on their breakout full-length, <i>Dandelion Gum</i>. While that record was like a broken dam of warm liquid, Tobacco's latest solo effort, this year's <i>Maniac Meat</i>, was more like a half-functioning spigot of scalding water: Melodies came in sharp, hard-hitting bursts that attempted to burn your brain.</p>
<p><i>Maniac Meat</i> was more straightforward than anything put out by the BMSR crew-- but listening to it front-to-back still induced a sensory overload at points. Tobacco's companion EP,Â <i>LA UTI</i>, takes some measures to correct that. The concept-- rappers laying verses over <i>Maniac Meat</i> cuts, as well as a few new jams-- isn't novel in this endlessly reusable age, but the execution is surprisingly effective. A steady presence is exactly what this music needs in terms of an anchor, as the sheer anthemic nature of cuts like ""Lick the Witch"" and ""Sweatmother"" emerges from the mud-soaked ether it was previously lurking behind.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the function of the rapping greatly outstrips the actual quality. While it's enjoyable to hear the recently reunited Anti-Pop Consortium have fun over ""TV All Greasy"", they also struggle to keep up rhythmically, occasionally slipping from their internal rhythms while delivering stale, uninventive lines. Avant-rap mainstay Doseone somehow becomes another functional cog in the twinkling crunch of new track ""The Injury"", and not much more; Chicago MC Serengeti, on the other hand, failingly attempts to match the sleazy drip of ""2 Thick Scoops"" in delivery. It seems like a lot of the guests here are trying to out-weird the material they're delivering over, which is precisely why Rob Sonic's appearance on ""Lick the Witch"" works so well. Sonic rides the track's asthmatic gasps tightly, delivering surrealist details (""A benchwarmer groom for greeting Marine Corps"") with a hardhead's conviction. Instead of getting smothered, you're basically getting punched in the face; Tobacco could stand to be this violent a little more often.</p></div>"|14871.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14871-la-uti-ep/|6.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

Refreshingly, the all-female quartet the Suzan are neither. On their debut, <i>Golden Week for the Poco Poco Beat</i>, the all-girl Suzan mine garage-rock, pop, new wave, surf-rock, riot-grrrl, and even gypsy-folk for inspiration. This makes for a collection that isn't unified in sound but has an omnivorous attitude that permeates throughout. While some may find the lack of stylistic cohesion to be a drawback, <i>Poco Poco Beat</i> doesn't sound scattered. Rather than coming off as an overstuffed collection by a group who couldn't stick to (or make) one singular aesthetic choice, the album feels like it's burning through a history of girl groups from the Shangri-Las to the Raincoats and the Go-Go's.</p>
<p>Despite that fact, there are a few stylistic markers that act as glue for this willfully disjointed collection. One is the charming vocals of frontwoman Saori Suzuki: Eschewing any of the cloying girlish notes of her versatile voice, she sounds self-assured and womanly, whether she's cooing, scat-singing, or snarling. Another is the band's facility with creating ambiance. They're as adept at creating a sense of creeping dread as they are at summoning celebratory cacophonies. On an album this varied, the Suzan have room to show off all their different sides, and the fact that they sound perfectly natural in both pub-punk screamer mode (""London Tonight"") <i>and</i> in a more soulful 60s pop style (""Ha Ha Ha"") is a testament to their musicality. Perhaps their most essential skill is their ability to temper their most sugary, most melodic impulses with enough tough, raw, or sparse ones to keep things from becoming too precious. For example, despite the almost sickly sweet xylophone that kicks off album opener ""Home"", the song smartly builds an ESG-worthy groove with its rhythmically chanted vocals and tom-heavy drive to become the LP's best track.</p>
<p>As you may have already heard, the Suzan were ""discovered"" on MySpace by BjÃ¶rn Yttling (of Peter Bjorn and John), pulled out of the vast, overwhelming Internet-music morass by a producer with a proven track record. Then they became the first traditional rock band (although the term ""traditional"" here is a slight stretch) signed to A-Trak and Nick Catchdub's Fool's Gold label. It isn't hard to see why these independent music heavies were won over by this developing-but-driven group from half a world away. The Suzan have an infectious energy, and the ambitious scope of their debut is impressive (if, admittedly, exhausting). Would the band have been better served if they'd tightened their musical scope and not made such a genre-hopping collection?

From the time of their debut single, ""Tally Ho!"", in 1981, the trio has since been cited as a massive inspiration to everyone from indie rock's Old Guard (Pavement, Yo La Tengo) to some of today's most exciting underground bands (Times New Viking, Crystal Stilts, the late Jay Reatard). With the Clean's reputation seemingly at an all-time high, one has to wonder how mighty a shadow the band has cast over its native land. With their debut record,Â <i>Confusion</i>, Surf Friends-- a young duo from Auckland-- attempt to wriggle their way out from under the Clean's heavy influence.</p>
<p>On parts of the record, it proves to be a struggle. Throughout the band swipes moves from the playbook of their forebears-- a few jangly guitars here, a few Farfisa organs there. A song like ""Human"" carries all of the hallmarks of a Clean tune, aside from unspectacular vocals being pushed high in the mix. Surf Friends' love for the band doesn't always serve as an albatross, however; the driving, catchy, and sun-drenched ""Late Night"" and ""Enjoy the Show"" are picture-perfect homages to the auspicious first decade of the the Clean, while ""You're on My Mind"" is an earworm that captures their off-the-cuff brilliance. ""I Tried"" adds something new to the template, starting out with a chiming guitar figure and building the entire song over a blissfully woozy undercurrent, even at one point sampling a percussive, synthesized horn blast eerily reminiscent of the opening to Bell Biv Devoe's ""Poison"".</p>
<p>When the band is making a clear effort to stand apart from the Flying Nun label, it proves to be a mixed bag. The intro of ""No Oil"" finds them restlessly experimenting with ambient loops before locking into a sulking, bass-driven groove and then devolving into meandering aimlessness. On the other hand, closing out with the album's title track, they focus on droning, blurry guitars and a bubbling, hypnotic bassline while providing many exploratory detours and even a couple of sharp tempo changes throughout the song's 10 minutes. While the template they've set for themselves can prove to be rigid at points, <i>Confusion</i> is a record that proves Surf Friends are capable of expanding upon it and even abandoning it completely. But in order for them to truly set their own path, they'll have to learn to do such a thing a little more often.</p></div>"|14826.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14826-confusion/|6.1|Martin Douglas

Laetitia Sadier described it as having ""31 songs, which are split into two halves. One is the day side,  and one is the nighttime side.""</p>
<p>Over the past year and a half, <i>Not Music</i> was pared back considerably: The final version features 13 songs, including two extended remixes of <i>Chemical Chords</i> songs by the Emperor Machine and Atlas Sound. This turns out to have been an effective approach. The careful song selection and sequencing of this mix is intended to play like a proper studio album, and mostly, it does, even with the 8-minute-plus remixes acting as centerpieces. And while obviously similar in sound to <i>Chemical Chords</i>, the record is suffused with as much joyous synth experimentation, astral effects and flourishes, and buzzy motorik rhythms as Stereolab's mid-career efforts.</p>
<p>Needless to say, if you're hoping for a career-defining endcap, this is not that record. The new, non-remix tracks on <i>Not Music</i> ignore much of Stereolab's omnivorous career-- there's no space-age bachelor pad music, no bossa nova flourishes, and no sign of the rawer avant-garde leanings that shaped their earliest records. Instead, the set continues in the taut, propulsive pop vein of their more recent releases.</p>
<p>Album opener ""Everybody's Weird Except Me"" is sweet yet dry, using the richness of Laetitia Sadier's nonchalant alto to cut the cuteness of the melody. The track plays off the dichotomies Stereolab have come to love-- old-fashioned pop tropes delivered by whirring, futuristic instruments, with cold detachment rubbing up against whimsical lushness and cerebral orchestrations played with charm. ""Sun Demon"" opens by deconstructing a garage-rock melody (there's a trace of the Castaways' ""Liar, Liar"" organ line in there) with splashes of videogame bleeps, then throws its back into an unrelenting rhythmic chug. And ""Two Finger Symphony"" explicitly answers the last record's ""One Finger Symphony"" with its slightly altered repetitive keyboard vamp.</p>
<p>Stereolab's last effort was among the most concise and tightly focused of the band's career, distilling their baroque, buzzing aesthetic into breathless, three-minute pop songs. <i>Not Music</i> mostly echoes that change, but also sprawls like vintage Stereolab when it needs to, as on the 10-plus-minute centerpiece ""Silver Sands [Emperor Machine Mix]"", which turns the xylophone melody of the <i>Chemical Chords</i> original into a sparse, mechanized krautrock throb.</p>
<p>The Stereolab story for the last five years has been, ""Yep, they still sound like Stereolab."" And if we're disappointed that the band's ever-experimental drive feels stifled by the brevity of this newer material, perhaps this hiatus is well-timed. While we learn to finally miss the quirky, stylish synth-pop that we've begun to take for granted, we'll have to content ourselves with <i>Not Music</i> as the band's final hurrah-- at least for now. I suspect it won't be long before we realize that the leftovers of a band like Stereolab are still better than main dishes offered up by many of their peers. And maybe by then, they'll be back to recording.</p></div>"|14838.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14838-not-music/|7.5|Rebecca Raber

There's something in the onomatopoeia of it, and even more in the way it invokes feelings of being hit, slapped, pummeled, giddy, bruised. Imagine getting beaten up a little and drifting into a woozy, dizzy state, with cartoon-like birdies and stars circling overhead: That's the kind of dubstep favored most by Punch Drunk, a label that helped make Bristol, England one of the style's main flashpoint locales.</p>
<p><i>Worth the Weight: Bristol Dubstep Classics--</i> a 2xCD set with 26 tracks-- surveys the sound of the city more than Punch Drunk per se. And more power to it. (A call-out in the liner notes even casts Bristol as ""dubstep's second city,"" behind London, as it were.) The sound of Bristol as compiled here tends toward the generally dark and ruff and tumble, as is made clear from the first lurches and stabs of Pinch's ""Midnight Oil"". A pointed opener, it traffics in what sounds like Pinch's having decided, on a whim, to follow every kick of the bass with the beat of a snare drum placed everywhere it might sound slightly ""off,"" just to see what would happen. Heard the first time, it plays almost like the result of a game. But then it starts to reveal a pattern as it stretches out, a real organizing structure to a new sort of rhythm that proves to be less haphazard than it initially sounds.</p>
<p>That kind of surprise and subsequent rush of new understanding is what makes dubstep, at its best, exciting. And there's a lot of it here, enlisted in different ways by the likes of Peverelist, Appleblim, Headhunter, Joker, Guido, and more. There's much to be gleaned from the difference between Pinch's brutish opening salvo and the second track, Peverelist's ""The Grind"", which floats and glides in all the places where Pinch trips himself up. And then from there to where Gatekeeper, in ""Tense Past"", bears down and simply stomps.</p>
<p>Those first three tracks alone signal <i>Worth the Weight</i>'s focus on the more rhythmic, low-end, and sober extremes of dubstep. The style's recent trends toward weird weightless smearing and especially soulful vocal pastiche don't get much play. Instead, for better and worse, <i>Worth the Weight</i> sounds almost fixated on the formidable. It's ""better"" in that none of the tracks is ever less than strong. But it's ""worse"" in the way that one can grow weary of hearing such shows of relentless strength in succession, without at least a little reprieve. Dubstep, in a club context, thrives on strange intra-set swerves and spells of deep breathing. That's not to say there's no variety here between grim, haunting, decimated-planet anthems like Appleblim &amp; Peverelist's ""Circling"" and Joker's playfully wobbly video-game ooze. But everything on <i>Worth the Weight</i> is, in ways that can't be escaped, very heavy indeed.</p></div>"|14865.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14865-worth-the-weight-bristol-dubstep-classics/|6.9|Andy Battaglia

In America they did it via <i>Pretty in Pink</i> with a less art-rock and more palatably pop version of the sound that is popular now-- the sound that made them stars in the UK. You might think it's the perfect time for the band to stage an improbable comeback, to once again take their original synth-disco sound all the way. Hey, if 43-year-old house producer David Guetta can transform himself into a <i>Billboard</i> star, anything's possible, right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately <i>History of Modern</i> won't be conquering anything except maybe the already primed nostalgia circuit. After a long layoff, OMD have made the kind of the just-okay, just-what-you'd expect album that's always snagged by the handful of folks hungry for anything new by their Big 1980s faves. Think of all those middling Tears for Fears and Erasure ""reunion"" albums that feel mostly like announcements that their creators aren't quite dead yet: Someone's got to be buying them, despite the fact that they rarely match (let alone top) the originals. So it goes with <i>History of Modern</i>.</p>
<p>Not that delivering what your aging audience expects is such a bad thing, especially when your attempts to move beyond those expectations can be kind of embarrassing. No one's ""rock"" should <i>try</i> to imitate the cranky, grit-less late Jesus and Mary Chain or Primal Scream's limpest electro-sleaze, though ""New Babies; New Toys"" sounds like OMD thinks both bands were onto something. And while their dance-pop songs, like ""The Future, the Past, and Forever After"", might yet make it onto the playlists of your less-discerning gay clubs, their thin Hi-NRG pastiches would be eaten alive on the radio, where today's meat-wearing bad romancers have made big beats and instant-earworm choruses a requirement. If your kids abuse you with <i>The Fame Monster</i> on the way to school, don't think counter-programming <i>History of Modern</i> is going to help you seem down.</p>
<p>At its best, <i>HOM</i> sticks to the sound that made OMD stars-- lush, romantic 80s-style electronic music, Andy McCluskey still shamelessly manhandling the melodramatic romantic metaphor, perfect for your high school reunion or remembering prom night-- while mostly ignoring the pre-America ""difficult"" stuff that made them interesting. This is definitely not an album aimed at young post-punk fans who just connected with the ambitious, avant-leaning, and recently reissued <i>Dazzle Ships</i>, OMD's last stab at proggy pomp before they became more reliable (and less winningly weird) hit-makers. But when they want to, OMD can still hit that peak of corny slow-dance grandeur, as on the second part of the title track. So if getting ripped on a box of white wine and bringing on VH1 Classic is how you fill up your weeknights, here's a way to recreate the feeling at your cubicle the next day while still nominally listening to something new.</p></div>"|14856.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14856-history-of-modern/|5.0|Jess Harvell

But with his new solo effort, WOD bassist Dave Hartley takes a more sincere approach to the name game-- Nightlands is quite literally a bedroom recording experiment, in which Hartley attempts to translate hazy, morning-after remembrances of last night's dreams into songs that try to recapture their feeling, if not their meaning. With its reliance on analog synths, drum machines, angelic harmonies, and shape-shifting structures, the music of Nightlands bears almost no relation to the music of Hartley's better-known day gig, or the open-road reveries of fellow WOD member Kurt Vile-- <i>Forget the Mantra</i> is less War on Drugs than simply brain-on-drugs.</p>
<p>""Dreamy"" is often used in a rock-crit context as a synonym for serenity and ecstasy, an interpretation that belies the fact that our dreams are often confusing, disturbing experiences comprised of inexplicable imagery and occurrences. It's this ambiguous sensation-- hovering in that netherworld between the foreign and the familiar, the comforting and the haunting-- that Hartley successfully conjures on <i>Forget the Mantra</i>. On the surface, the album sounds less like a document of Hartley's deep-sleep exploration than a gauge of how Brian Wilson's influence on indie-rock has mutated and manifested itself over the past 15 years, recalling at various times the space-age soft-rock of the High Llamas, the choral pastorales of Fleet Foxes, and the phantasmagoric psych-pop of Panda Bear. But Hartley proves himself adept at putting these customary melodic and harmonic devices to devious use, whether setting the hypnotic, repeated refrain of the opening title track to a jarring, jack-hammered drum break, or shattering the bucolic bliss of ""God What Have I"" with an anodyne chorus of voices asking the ominous question, ""oh my, oh my god, what have I done?""</p>
<p>In keeping with the dream concept, <i>Forget the Mantra</i> turns stranger and more inscrutable the deeper you venture into it. The album's back half is given over to more amorphous, lengthier pieces that interlace found spoken-word recordings with wordless harmonies, hypnotic folkie finger-picking, and manipulated string and synth textures. Though never quite degenerating into ""Revolution 9""-style sound-collage splatter-- Hartley carefully layers the myriad elements onto purposeful, dramatic arcs, particularly on the eerily compelling ""Longways Homebound, 2010""-- <i>Forget the Mantra</i>'s enigmatic second act tends to blur the line between music that's meant to evoke a dream state and music that lulls you into one. But, ponderous lapses aside, Nightlands' psychic terrain is still a nice place to visit, even if you wouldn't want to spend the whole night there.</p></div>"|14859.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14859-forget-the-mantra/|7.0|Stuart Berman

It's the perfect moment in which to launch an assault on the charts: liberated from any drive for formal innovation, and whittled down to a simple and recognizable repetitive groove formula, dubstep can now inhabit a variety of pop guises while avoiding the identity crisis such moves would have provoked five years ago.</p>
<p>Enter Magnetic Man, which appropriately enough is something of a dubstep supergroup comprising Benga and Skream (perhaps the scene's two most broadly popular producers), together with Artwork, who've been largely silent since their trend-setting 2002 EP <i>Red</i>. Notwithstanding the aggregated pedigree, Magnetic Man feels like a Benga-helmed affair, and most of the group's eponymous album comes on like a fleshed-out, glossy take on Benga's 2008 album,Â <i>Diary of an Afro Warrior. </i>The good news for dubstep fans is that this self-consciously sleek and glossy makeover doesn't really depart from the template that album established. The bad news is, well, that <i>is </i>the bad news: Benga's honed brand of lurching, constipated grooves represents dubstep at its most enervated and unappealing; the widely held conviction that this template represents dubstep at its most crossover-friendly is simply further evidence that audiences are unhealthily enamored with buzzing ugliness right now (file it all next to David Guetta-produced R&amp;B).</p>
<p>If <i>Magnetic Man </i>remains a substantially better album than <i>Diary of Afro Warrior</i>, it's because there's more going on than just Benga's boring beatwork. Having abandoned any pretense at rhythmic tension or novelty, the group instead focuses on constructing trebly, fleshy synthesizer melodies cribbed from mid-00s electro-house (and, by extension, trance). The results vaguely recall the lush but metallic pop-techno of Ellen Allien &amp; Apparat's <i>Orchestra of Bubbles</i>. This is a sensible direction for populist dubstep, and Magnetic Man concoct appropriately weedy synth arpeggios and moody atmospherics, though the psuedo-classical motifs on ""Flying Into Tokyo"" and ""Karma Crazy"" trip into hamfisted territory. Ultimately, though, these attempts at melodic levity remain constrained by leaden beats and the boom/bust dynamics of the arrangements, whose cyclical predictability results in most of the tunes' exhausting their welcome within minutes.</p>
<p>Things go better on the vocal tracks, where that same predictable structure usefully frames verses and choruses, in the process receiving a revitalized sense of purpose. The excellent ""Crossover"" pits the wearying grind of the bass-driven groove against Katy B's soft, nurturing vocals, capturing musically the suggestion of temporary sanctuary from endless struggle that Katy paints lyrically. This is the sort of songwork that dubstep facilitates best-- unless it's the cocksure swagger of Rihanna's dubstep-influenced ""Wait Your Turn"", here represented by the grim ""Fire"" featuring Ms. Dynamite providing stern ragga chat. Consistent with dubstep's preferred range of emotions, the songs on <i>Magnetic Man </i>are all variations on a military march, choosing dogged determination, smouldering aggression, or vexed frustration over love or lust.</p>
<p>Maybe it's not romance that dubstep has difficulty accommodating so much as release-- the ecstatic affirmation that is dance-pop's <i>raison d'etre</i>. The exception that proves the rule on both counts is the vibrant ""Perfect Stranger"", a heady collision of moody halfstep R&amp;B verses and breakbeat-driven old-skool rave choruses, with Katy B again handling vocal duties with airy grace. ""Perfect Stranger"" may depart from dubstep's formal sonic signposts, but its explosive releases of rhythmic vitality capture perfectly the appeal of uptempo dubstep at its best, while underscoring the frustrating limitations and contradictions of the rest of the album. Magnetic Man's arrangements may proudly flaunt dance-pop's most universal qualities, but their efforts remain mere gestures so long as their beats continue to stare so resentfully in the opposite direction.</p></div>"|14799.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14799-magnetic-man/|5.9|Tim Finney

In fact, they do just about everything a great live band-- especially a great live <i>dance</i> band-- should do. Known to stretch their songs out to ""special disco version"" lengths, they're able to bring audiences from simmering anticipation to hands-up screaming release in the span of a song, and then do it again. And then again. Like <i>Remain in Light</i>-era Talking Heads, the closest comparison to LCD at their current ""locked-in but loose"" onstage peak, they could release a live album that might offer equal thrills to their studio discs.</p>
<p>But <i>London Sessions</i> is not LCD's <i>The Name of This Band is Talking Heads</i>, and at least one reason why not is because live in-studio sessions like this one tend to capture artists in a slightly different mode than during a full-on concert, where a band can feed off the energy of thousands of sweat-soaked fans. The band mentions iconic BBC radio host John Peel's legendary program when talking about the album for a reason: Like those old Peel sessions, this set finds the band offering tighter, cleaner, more focused versions of their live staples, running through all nine songs with an electrifying, stripped-down effortlessness.</p>
<p>Here, James Murphy proves that even without the thick, enveloping sound his production chops lent <i>This Is Happening</i>, he can match his heroes' delivery: His rare ability to snap from mordant humor to affecting pathos comes through loud and clear with back-to-back takes on ""Daft Punk Is Playing at My House"" and ""All My Friends"". But as great of a frontman as he is, LCD's shit-hot rhythm section, anchored by drummer Pat Mahoney and ex-!!! member Tyler Pope, nearly steals the spotlight. Their interplay is as mesmerizing to listen to here (especially those perfectly timed keyboard jolts that spike the intensity of ""Get Innocuous"" just a little higher each time) as it is to watch in person. And for a kinda-sorta disco band, they tear the roof off in a live-and-loud way. The sense of possible frenzy that lurks behind the slightly-too-hot ""metronomic"" groove of ""Us V Them"" builds to an edge-of-control climax that's even more thrilling than if the band had actually spun into a freakout.</p>
<p>Of course, since these tracks aren't exactly radical live reconstructions, there aren't a ton of surprises on <i>London Sessions</i>. But it's still a wonder to hear a band this committed, this on its game, without the studio tweaks. Plus, you've got to consider what a debased format LCD is working with here. The number of actually transcendent live records-- whether recorded at a radio station or in an arena-- is almost laughably small considering how many exist. This one's a gift, the second LCD's given us this year.</p></div>"|14864.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14864-london-sessions/|8.2|Jess Harvell

It established a precedent for the Berlin-based electronic label's series: at their best, these compilations serve as both a living document of the artist's inspirations and the progression of their sound, as well as a testament to their tastemaking abilities.</p>
<p>Milo Cordell, one half of the post-Britpop duo the Big Pink, uses this second entry in the <i>Tapes</i> series as an introduction to the sounds gathered under the loose banner of witch house. Showcasing bands like Salem, GRâ LL GRâ LL, oOoOO, and Balam Acab, Cordell mostly proves just how hard he's pressed his ear to the ground in 2010. For the most part, he picks some of the juiciest bits of the syrupy, spooked-out electronic movement: From Balam Acab's gorgeous, ethereal ""See Birds (Moon)"" to the monstrous, chillingly drab early Salem cut ""Dirt"", it's clear that Cordell is no casual listener, able to prudently pluck from several sides of the sound's spectrum. When he's at his best, his curatorial skills may even provoke a bit of second-guessing from the genre's naysayers-- the appeal of this music is easy to understand.</p>
<p>The problem is, the music is presented with a blend of other styles; it's too haphazard to define a clear statement. Cordell himself admits that much of this music ""has never been released on a CD, it's just out there on the Internet."" And yet he fails to grasp the irony of combining such diverse elements here: This is not music crafted for a DJ-style mix; its chilly sound is simply better suited to floating in the cold, crystalizing ethers of cyberspace. By haphazardly lumping it in with material that has nothing to do with witch house per se, a lot of its impact is lost.</p>
<p>Cordell includes choice bits of dubstep (Joker's bounce epic ""Snake Eater""), minimalist electro (Actress' ""Hubble""), and a few oddball tracks that, even at their most ridiculously lame (Sewn Leather's glue-huffing-comedown jam ""Smoke Ov the Pvnk""), feel entertaining. But aside from the inclusion of like-minded artists the xx and Gang Gang Dance (their excellent remix of the Big Pink's ""Velvet"" makes an appearance), it's anyone's guess as to why the the Big Pink moniker is on the front of this thing-- there's no consistency to tie it to a single group's sound. Instead, this installment of <i>Tapes</i> feels like the decent mix of a guy with good taste, a broadband connection, and a little experience with the crossfade knob.</p></div>"|14834.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14834-tapes/|5.8|Zach Kelly

Accidental's very first recording, an answering machine sketch-turned-jam that he and longtime bandmate Charles Spearin slyly called ""Kev's Message For Charlie"". That was back in 1996. Drew began to play a very simple, one-finger keyboard melody, and Spearin added additional instrumentation. A bass figure there, a few liquid guitar chords here, a bit of brushed snare drum, and wham-- a song was born in such an unexpected, accidental way that it prompted Drew and Spearin to continue recording together. The whole thing lasts only two-and-half minutes, but it's magic: You can hear the bedrock of what would become Broken Social Scene as it began to form.</p>
<p>""Kev's Message For Charlie"" was one part of K.C. Accidental's first album, <i>Captured Anthems For an Empty Bathtub</i>. That six-song, self-released record has been paired with the follow-up LP, <i>Anthems For the Could've Bin Pills</i>, and is being given a deluxe wide release via Drew's Arts &amp; Crafts imprint. <i>Empty Bathtub</i> was recorded by Spearin and Drew in the latter's childhood bedroom over the course of five days. It's by far the moodier and less focused of the two efforts, though again, in the overdriven guitar charge of opener ""Nancy and the Girdle Boy"" or loose, funereal feel of ""Save the Last Breath for Me"", a great deal of early chemistry between Drew and Spearin can be heard on tape. That's not so much the case in the jazz strokes of ""Something For Chicago"" or trance-y ""Anorexic He-Man"", two other experiments that never really take hold or display much synergy.</p>
<p>For <i>Could've Bin Pill</i>, the two upgraded their studio setup and hunkered down in a friend's living room. Rather than play all the instruments themselves (save for the trumpet work of BSS's Jimmy Shaw), they added further layers from future BSS members Justin Peroff, Emily Haines, and Jason Collett. Haines actually provides vocals in a duet with Drew on ""Them (Pop Song #3333)"", his very first recording as a vocalist. The additions make for a more muscular unit, one whose expanse you can hear stretch and congeal nicely across every cut. As a whole, that approach provides a listenable, clear bridge to <i>You Forgot It in People</i> and onward. ""Instrumental Died in the Bathtub and Took the Daydreams With It"" builds naturally and beautifully, its guitar and violin parts constantly on the climb. And ""Silverfish Eyelashes"" swaps those guitars for washed-out synths, daisy chaining them with sad-eyed string flourishes to elegant, pre-Postal Service effect. Though the improvisational feel is still present here throughout, the focus that galvanizes every second more or less belies the original, ""accidental"" nature from which they took their name. Full-bodied, completely immersive songs like the gauzy ""Ruined in 84"" don't so much capture an impromptu experiment as they capture a <i>band</i> at work.</p></div>"|14855.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14855-captured-anthems-for-an-empty-bathtub-anthems-for-the-couldve-bin-pills/|7.4|David Bevan

Whether playing live or recording a new entry in their numbered series of albums for Rune Grammofon/ECM, they don't rehearse or make plans. Instead, they convene and explore, following their collective muse into sound-worlds that seldom fail to seem conceptually centered, despite their spontaneous nature. And in general, I'm game to follow them wherever they go. But they lost me for a minute with <i>Supersilent 9</i>, which sounded like someone had fallen asleep on the keys of a Hammond organ. To be fair, the quartet had recently become a trio with the departure of drummer Jarle Vespestad, and perhaps they were adjusting to the new line-up. Happily, they've bounced back strong for <i>10</i> and <i>11</i>. The latter is a mite uneven, collecting leftovers from the sessions for <i>Supersilent 8</i> in a vinyl-only format. The former is arguably the finest and most coherent piece of music they've ever recorded.</p>
<p>After 12 years together, it seemed as if Supersilent had tried everything under the sun, from the spattering noise of their early issues to the ambient-inclined <i>5</i> to the daunting electro-acoustic jazz of <i>8</i>. But on <i>10</i>, they reveal a new direction that would be obvious for anyone else but is counterintuitive for them: a more acoustic, lyrical, almost traditional approach. As much as I admire their more ""difficult"" works, <i>10</i> is not only their most listenable record, but their bravest, clearing away the usual thickets of disturbance to let the technical skill and emotional acuity of the players shine through. The elegant interplay between StÃ¥le StorlÃ¸kken's often-chromatic Steinway piano and Arve Henriksen's talkative trumpet, with its inimitably airy yet ragged timbre, is front and center. As if in recognition of something special happening, producer Deathprod keeps a low profile, subtly coloring the music with quietly cosmic keyboards and hushed ambiance. The result is more similar to Henriksen's beautiful album <i>Cartography</i> than anything in the Supersilent catalog, with the same cold, thin air and heart-wrenching, effortlessly modulated motifs. Minimal ambient and noise passages knit together moving set pieces like the eerie ""10.3"", the pliant ""10.6"", and the penetratingly wistful ""10.8"".</p>
<p>But lest anyone think that Supersilent have gone soft, <i>11 </i>opens with a long and seemingly breakbeat-inspired passage of electronic mayhem. This is one of the aforementioned disturbances they favor, and it seems a right mess when compared to the impeccable poise of <i>10</i>. But if you persevere through this nerve-jangling start, you'll be treated to a slow and expressive solo from Henriksen that carries into a more satisfying section of power electronics and fractured beats. Shades of postmodern lounge and rock music ensue, and the album manages to achieve an undeniable if broken throughline despite the disparate nature of its parts. If it feels a bit forced, it also represents the sort of challenging music for which many listeners value Supersilent. But it's <i>10</i> that represents a new chapter for the group, without longtime collaborator Vespestad, and so it's the ideal moment to ask: What are all these numbers adding up to? So far, the answer is a body of work that can be difficult or forthcoming, beautiful or ugly, but never anything short of fully committed. And the sequence isn't finished yet. <i>Supersilent 12</i> has already been announced, and after the re-centering maneuvers of <i>9</i>, <i>10</i>, and <i>11</i>, who knows where they'll end up next.</p></div>"|14818.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14818-10-11/|8.4|Brian Howe

So what's with the <i>BleachÂ­</i>-like cover of <i>Quarters</i>? Is the Seattle quartet trying to cement its place in the city's musical legacy, or, gasp! trying to present themselves as ""serious artists?"" Of course, a closer look at the grayscale image shows the group amidst a gang of empty liquor bottles, skateboards, and assorted video game equipment.</p>
<p>In fact, <i>Quarters </i>might be even more of a straight-up party record than its predecessor, a welcome relief that Truckasauras aren't trying to overcompensate for working within a niche that's almost entirely defined by its novelty. While ""instrumental hip-hop"" often brings to mind Dilla heads or the bugged-out experimentalism of the Brainfeeder scene, Truckasauras have always put themselves forth unironically as ""crunk."" It's not the most accurate description, but they do share a sort of kinship with more slithery but no less hedonistic Atlanta sounds, as tracks like ""Dom P on Your Backneck"" and ""Show These People Who's Springstein (Yes We Can)"" boast enough 808 and B-A-S-S bass to soundtrack a night cruise to Magic City.</p>
<p><i>Tea Parties </i>turned out to be enduring even after you got past the <i>Contra</i> and Ultimate Warrior jokes, in large part because its sonics explored a fragile, low-grade beauty. That aspect is still on <i>Quarters</i>, though they arrive at it differently, locating more placid drones while maintaining a rhythmic force. If the prickly, pinwheeling beeps at the outset of ""No More Nerds, Comanche Brancho"" were to simply repeat throughout, it would likely drive you batshit, but it becomes something more like a percussive effect under the quacking bass-- it's not far off from <i>Discovery</i>'s side B or even DÃ¢m-Funk for its honest appropriation of roller rink chintz.</p>
<p>While <i>Quarters </i>is ultimately a refinement of Truckasauras' sound, it's possible that some might be mildly let down as they focus more on craftsmanship than showmanship-- once again, the overall packaging of this stuff is important, and the inherent humor sometimes only manifests itself in the song titles, instead of in the wow factor of recognizing a sample from <i>Operation Wolf</i>. But if the primary battle that Truckasauras face is avoiding redundancy while still being a genre of one, credit them for having the upper hand on <i>Quarters.</i></p></div>"|14847.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14847-quarters/|7.6|Ian Cohen

Think about the shitty poems you wrote when you were young (I have one that plagiarizes Green Day's ""Longview""!) and then listen to the splintered and elusive songs collected on this Modest Mouse release. Clearly, Brock had a head start on seeing things differently from the rest of us.</p>
<p>That is one of the more profound takeaways from the so-called Great Lost Modest Mouse album, a 24-track collection of occasionally brilliant odds and ends that was spared the fate of being the band's introduction to the world. Delays forced them to move on and record <i>This Is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing to Think About</i> before <i>Sad Sappy Sucker</i> could be released.  From a historical vantage point, they lucked out-- <i>Sucker</i> has its moments, but they would take a quantum leap from here to <i>This Is a Long Drive</i>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a few facets of Modest Mouse's unmistakable sound glint through on these songs, recorded with Calvin Johnson for K Records. There are those eerily pinging bent guitar harmonics, for one, a noise that sounded entirely alien at the time, as well as the way the guitar and bass circled warily around each other without locking, two halves of an endlessly spiraling argument. Jeremiah Green was already an astoundingly talented drummer, one who could fill every inch of available space without overwhelming Brock's harmonically simple songs.</p>
<p>And Brock-- well, first of all, he sounds astoundingly <i>young</i>. His lisp, which would grow a little less noticeable over time, is almost painfully pronounced on <i>Sad Sappy Sucker</i>-- ""Mice Eat Cheese""'s title is rendered ""mithe eat cheethe."" His singing is frail and nervous, and the words are often obscured by mumbling. The lyrics that do surface are like little placeholders for all of Brock's future lyrical obsessions-- ""you can see that birds and worms don't get along,"" in ""Worms Vs. Birds""; ""Looks like accounting's not accountable for anything or anyone at all/ Jonny took the fall,"" he yelps in ""Race Car Grin You Ain't No Landmark"". The ringing opening guitar figure for ""It Always Rains on a Picnic"" would pop up almost unchanged on<i> Long Drive'</i>s ""Talking Shit About a Pretty Sunset""-- in fact, the former song sounds like a dry run for the latter. It's absorbing listening, but hardly consequential.</p>
<p>When <i>Sad Sappy Sucker</i> first saw release in 2001, on the heels of the monumental <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i>, it felt more like a yellowing sketchbook of curiosities bequeathed to diehard fans than a proper album. Nine years later, now on Brock's Glacial Pace label, it still feels that way. It's being reissued at the same time as the 1997 EP <i>The Fruit That Ate Itself</i>, and taken together, you get a pleasantly bracing aerial view of a young band's gradual development. <i>The Fruit That Ate Itself</i> has some of the band's most abrasive moments-- the title track, in particular, is harrowing, just a descending bassline and Brock's screaming his unhinged napkin poetry (""Take a drive in the wrong hand lane/ Got bad breath talking about fresh rain"") until he's hoarse. But it also had the first hints of the band's fascination with sound effects and overdubs-- the skirling backwards guitars that show up repeatedly point to the frozen-tundra ambience of their later works.</p>
<p>Brock and his bandmates didn't alter a thing for these reissues; there are no bonus tracks, no new songs. Neither of them is an essential Modest Mouse release, but if they provide anything new to us in 2010, it's a useful window back into the pre-Internet era of indie rock. The songs on <i>Sad Sappy Sucker</i> dribbled their way out into the world on 7""s and compilations-- 500 or 1,000 people bought them, and that was exactly the right audience for the music. Modest Mouse then moved on to the next project, honing their voice. In the Internet hothouse, improving your way into a larger audience is a more fitful, lurching affair, one that often happens in combustible bursts. For a young, unsteady group like Modest Mouse, being able to kick around the Pacific Northwest while working on their songwriting feels crucial to their development-- they had a long way to go from <i>Sad Sappy Sucker</i> to  <i>The Lonesome Crowded West</i> and <i>The Moon &amp; Antarctica</i>, and it's hard to imagine they would have gotten there the same way today.  Obscurity smarts, but sometimes it can be a useful cocoon.</p></div>"|14862.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14862-sad-sappy-sucker-the-fruit-that-ate-itself-ep/|7.2|Jayson Greene

We've heard thousands of drug-dealing tall tales, bloody murder threats, and clinically minded sex propositions, and these days that stuff just breezes past. If anything, the Young Jeezys of the world are less precise and less disquieting than the Spice 1s of old. So when L.A.'s teenage Odd Future crew snarled its way into the public consciousness earlier this year, the effect was truly jarring-- in part because it was so unfamiliar. Here are 19-year-old kids talking about sniffing coke and giggling about rape-- rec-room shit-talk that stings like a slap to the face. Crew leader Tyler, the Creator gargles kidnapping threats in a burned-out rasp way beyond his 19 years. Earl Sweatshirt, the crew's missing-in-action 16-year-old cult hero, tells you all about the chopped-up girl and cop locked up in the trunk of the car he doesn't have a learner's permit to drive. So when the OF duoÂ MellowHype open their new full-length with a story about blowing off a final exam, it's a relief in a full-body sigh sort of way. Compared to their crewmates, these kids are downright <i>cuddly</i>.</p>
<p>Hodgy Beats, the rapping half of MellowHype, is a Wiz Khalifa stoner-rap type who raps in a high, spaced-out mutter that still makes him sound way more alive than the crew's other resident stoner, the somnolent Domo Genesis. He's not soft-- ""ligaments will dissolve"" is a typical threat, and he has no problems rapping over gun sounds on a track called ""Gun Sounds"". On ""Loco"", heÂ namechecks 1960s Black Panthers with authority. But compared to a nutcase like Tyler, he's actually <i>humane</i>. Tyler makes two appearances on <i>BLACKENEDWHITE</i>. On the first, he leaves six cops dead. On the second, he offers up this: ""Fingers in the middle of bitches'Â bodaciousÂ buttcracks/ Enough fuckin' atheist rappers to get a nun slapped."" This is Tyler on his best behavior, but these are still the two gnarliest moments on the full-length. They're also the two most immediately arresting. With his laid-back approach, Hodgy can be a weird fit for Odd Future-- a technically sound rapper who can adapt to a lot of different styles but who never sounds like a paradigm-shifter. He's a strong supporting player but not much of a lead. So it's a good thing Left Brain, the other half of the group, is around.</p>
<p>Left Brain, who doesn't rap, is every bit the lo-fi beat experimentalist that Tyler is. The two-minute album opener ""Primo"" has great little keyboard plinks interrupting smeary synth wooze before everything slows down into a glitched-out, screwed-up crawl. That's a whole lot of movement for a two-minute introductory track, but it's typical of the whole record. Left Brain's tracks always mesmerize, but they never sit still. ""Gun Sounds"", ""Dead Deputy"", and ""Fuck the Police"" all work as muffled, homemade versions of the apocalyptic crunk bangers that Lex Luger makes for Waka Flocka Flame. ""Brain"" and ""Chordaroy"" are damaged, decayed takes on the lush, string-drenched yacht rap that the Neptunes have been making for a few years. ""Loaded"" is frankly jaw-dropping, an evil blaring creep that sounds like what might happen if an ominous synth-drone type like Oneohtrix Point Never tried making rap beats. (Note to Oneohtrix Point Never: Try making rap beats.)</p>
<p>Parts ofÂ <i>BLACKENEDWHITE</i> point toward what might happen when the Odd Future kids leave their terrifying self-created universe and engage with the world at large-- something that's almost inevitable now that major labels are knocking down their doors. ""Hell"" has a beat that's made partially out of someone muttering ""what the hell"" on a loop, but it also has an honest-to-god R&amp;B chorus, the first I've heard from these guys. After the crew has killed god knows how many women on tracks, bonus track ""Based"" features C. Renee, the first female rapper I've heard on an Odd Future song. (The R&amp;B chorus doesn't really work; the C. Renee verse absolutely does.)</p>
<p>But even as it nods toward accessibility,Â <i>BLACKENEDWHITE</i> works as yet another fascinating, bizarre, expectation-defying piece of work from a group of young artists who don't make anything else. And unlike the others, this one features zero rape threats. For neophytes, Tyler's <i>Bastard</i> is still the place to start; he's the group's figurehead and most talented member, and you really have to confront how fucked up these kids are if you have any interest in engaging them. ButÂ <i>BLACKENEDWHITE</i> pushes them closer to humanity without sacrificing the weirdness that's so central to their appeal. They're not out of surprises yet, and they probably won't be for a long time.</p></div>"|14850.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14850-blackenedwhite/|8.1|Tom Breihan

As OPN, Lopatin makes pretty serious, open-ended synth drones, and tracks like ""Planet Party"" felt a little too quirky to be his. But as time went on and we found out that Games was in fact a collaboration between Lopatin and longtime buddy Joel Ford of Tigercity, the project started to make more sense. Games are still about evocative synth music, but this time they're focused on nostalgia and recreating forgotten 80s production techniques.</p>
<p>The vibe they're after isn't easy to pinpoint, but you know it when you hear it. It's that 80s sound-- the cheesy mechanical pop that lived in commercials, movie soundtracks, and arcades. It's laser tag music, <i>Revenge of the Nerds</i> music. Games cop that style and make glitchy electro jams from it, and the appealing thing about these guys is how thoroughly they inhabit the sound. Partly it's equipment. They've got an arsenal of analog synths, and are able to make these instruments feel not just vintage but almost aged, like something you'd hear on a record found deep in the used bin.</p>
<p>The individual tracks that comprise <i>That We Can Play</i> are all pretty solid, and if you've followed the band you probably already know some of them. To me, the standout is still ""Planet Party"", just an unapologetic slice of Apple IIe funk. Over a clipped backing beat and chopped vocal samples, Games bend their synths as if using wah-wah pedals, giving the track this great wobbly whine. Newer cut ""Strawberry Skies"", featuring Brooklyn singer/producer Laurel Halo on vocals, is also very good, a super-bouncy new age workout that brings to mind Bananarama's ""Cruel Summer"". Gatekeeper's remix on the backend nicely ups the darkness, slowing the song down and adding ominous horror synths.</p>
<p>A few of the other tracks here, like the mostly instrumental ""Midi Drift"" and ""Shadows in Bloom"" aren't as melodically strong but do fit within the larger scheme. The EP's a little on the short side and Games do have more tracks than are included here; it might've been nice had they rounded it out with <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11979-everything-is-working/"" target=""_blank"">""Everything Is Working""</a> and <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/forkcast/14757-heartlands/"" target=""_blank"">""Heartlands""</a>. That's a minor complaint, though, and ultimately the record is a quirky and technical treat. Back in August, Games <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/39680-rising-games/"" target=""_blank"">told us</a> an inspiration for the project was ""anything that reminds us of our dads working."" Silly, but it sounds like they had fun making it. That carries over to the listening experience.</p></div>"|14840.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14840-that-we-can-play-ep/|7.6|Joe Colly

In a world suddenly crowded with dying malls, half-built condos, and underwater McMansions, the Detroit basement-punks' wobbly songwriting sounded weirdly poignant. And the name-- copped from the ubiquitous polyethylene house-wrap-- didn't hurt either.Â But unlike the Midwestern punks that came before them-- the Stooges, the Electric Eels, Negative Approach, to name a few-- Tyvek never seemed particularly cheesed-off about their surroundings. The rotating cast of collaborators fronted by guitarist/singer Kevin Boyer was agitated and noisy, but never aggressive.Â Something must be getting to them, though; on <i>Nothing Fits</i>, Tyvek are pissed-off.</p>
<p>The band's new full-length is tight, snotty, and pogo-worthy. The mellow instrumental snippets that padded the last LP are long gone. Now there's only the clacking of drumsticks to signal the next onslaught of distortion and motor-mouthed shouting. At some point in the past year, Tyvek decided to go hardcore.Â As a result, they nail the burnt-out 'burbs imagery better than ever. ""Underwater institution/ Silent hallways vacant always endless yards of paper trails/ Medications healthy systems baby doctors cut their tails,"" shouts Boyer over chunky power chords on ""Underwater 1"", ticking off his list of gripes. In the refrain, he boils it all down to one perfect image of a ""Safeway bag now sticking to my shoe."" ""Frustration Rock"", the band's original aggro anthem, sounds kind of nerdy in comparison.</p>
<p>Tyvek's first full-length was cobbled together from a smorgasbord of the bands favorite tapes-- practice takes and basement jams full of lo-fi gristle. This time around, Tyvek spent some money. <i>Nothing Fits</i> is the band's first release to be recorded in an actual studio, and the result is a shorter, more focused record, but hardly a cleaner one. The vocals are strangled, the guitars awash in amplifier buzz. On the title track-- with its unrelenting snare cracks and blizzard of treble-cranked guitars-- Tyvek come off like the Motor City's answer to Huggy Bear. It's mosh-worthy, but not to an ugly, macho extreme. Deep down, Tyvek will always be a little bit art-school.</p>
<p>But like the best old-time hardcore, there's an element of audience participation built in via shout-along refrains. Those lyrics are clear enough:Â ""People in the passing lane, just pricks in a car,"" sings Boyer. ""Fuck off!"" responds an overdubbed chorus.Â And burried down in the din, there's a tried and true posi-punk message. ""Underwater 2"" delivers the counter-arguement to Pt. 1's bleak, dumpster-diving worldview: ""Want to make it something out of nothing at all/ So we've gotta pull together/ Now we gotta just start small,"" sings Boyer. ""It's all right/ just do what you want."" Tyvek are slackers no more.</p></div>"|14860.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14860-nothing-fits/|7.8|Aaron Leitko

It was the very tail end of the bootleg era, and <i>Careful Clit Clit </i>felt like a seriously tardy but totally pleasurable contribution to the mash-up thing, mixing the brief vogue for snap rap with grime, techno, R&amp;B, Baltimore club, and a little rock. But apparently Radioclit also got bored with the mid-decade eclectic-or-die DJing style. When they truly made their name a few years later, it was with a seemingly new but heartfelt devotion to African music, first with the Very Best project and also by hawking various forms of African dance and pop and traditional music at their club nights.</p>
<p><i>The Sound of Club Secousse</i> documents this obsession. I've got only some idea of the tracks' local appeal, or how they fit together on the air or in the clubs of their native lands. But as played by Radioclit they're capable of sating modern club audiences in the Americas, Europe, anywhere that post-rave culture took hold. These are thin, jittery, speedy beats that skip, gallop, and clomp around, super-syncopated rhythms that feel closer to Caribbean-inflected post-rap pop, the early 2000s hard-firing soca-era of UK garage in particular. And like an ultra-poppy UK garage mix, everything about the set is fast, fast, fast. Sometimes deliriously so: Even the few melodic elements-- if you can even call these shrill bleep riffs, synth curlicues, and tinny little digi-highlife runs ""melodies""-- are hard to grab onto, more like being pleasantly bombarded with candy-colored sound effects. ""African Air Horn Dance"" by Jusa Dementor takes the kind of chintzy air horn noises that have been blaring through rap, dancehall, and rave mixes for decades and uses them like synth stabs, a continuous manic blare that runs through whole track. The even chintzier ice rink organ on Naty Kid's ""Sereia"" is pitched up to such an absurd degree that it sounds like Ray Manzarek cutting a happy hardcore single.</p>
<p>When the <i>Shangaan Electro: New Wave Dance Music from South Africa</i> compilation came out earlier this year, most pointed out its similarities (often inferred) to modern European dance music, which of course came as much from the music of Africa as it did from a Euro tradition. When it comes to modern club music, the lineage is (awesomely) all jumbled up, and impossible to untangle. Music from Africa can have just as strong an influence from imports shipped down from the European mainland or up from Jamaica, though certain site-specific stylistic touches usually shine through. So the real difference between <i>Club Secousse</i> and your average cheap pop techno record-- and it's a huge, rainbow-tinted difference-- is the voices, several decades worth of African singing styles squeezed onto a single disc. Those voices also create a vibe about as far from the human-free instrumental blandness of much ""serious"" dance music as you can get. Shouting, exhorting, crooning, and joking, these singers are what make <i>Club Secousse</i> a lovable party record, one made by the kind of people who sound less interested in ""innovating"" than actually delivering on dance music's eternal promise of a plain ol' good time. Tempos cranked high, hooks and beats made to catch ears and feet immediately, voices making the whole thing pop (in both sense of the word): If your standard house, techno, and dubstep collections have been feeling a little dry, Radioclit offers more evidence that the brightest, most functionally inventive, and most plain fun dance music may just be coming out of Africa right now.</p></div>"|14845.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14845-radioclit-presents-the-sound-of-club-secousse/|7.3|Jess Harvell

Is the Soul Machine</i> declared his 2004 follow-up. And if there was still any doubt that Cee-Lo loved high concepts, next came his Danger Mouse collaboration, Gnarls Barkley, and all of its costumed glory.Â Cee-Lo's third solo album is simply called <i>The Lady Killer</i>, but given his track record it's pretty obvious who that lady killer is meant to be. Admittedly, releasing a kiss-off single called ""Fuck You"" is not the usual MO of your typical ladies man, but then, there's nothing typical about Cee-Lo, a self-styled eccentric at once rooted in the formalism of classic soul but happily subverting the rules when the mood strikes. Motown, Stax, Philadelphia International-- all those familiar templates are on the table, but no one would ever confuse Cee-Lo's updates of revivalism or pastiche.</p>
<p>""Fuck You"" is such a gleefully profane, giddily catchy song that frankly it didn't need a corresponding album. Still, as conspicuous an anchor as ""Fuck You"" may be, it's not the only thing the album has going for it. With a bevy of soul-digging producers at his beck and call (including Salaam Remi and Brit synthesizers Fraser T. Smith and Paul Epworth; Bruno Mars' crew the Smeezingtons did ""Fuck You""), Cee-Lo has a blast role-playing the old-school soul man. Never mind the fact that his non-traditional voice isn't always the right fit for the material, the man's got more than enough personality to make his sideways take on mellow R&amp;B soar.</p>
<p>Throughout, Cee-Lo manages to avoid being both too rough or too smooth; that means we get not only the buoyant Motown homage ""It's OK"", but also the quiet storm seduction of ""Bodies"". He goes slinking 80s synth on ""Bright Lights Bigger City"", its stalking bass line consciously echoing ""Billie Jean"", but he's equally at ease transforming Band of Horses' ""No One's Gonna Love You"" into a slow jam. He cedes much of the spotlight to Paradiso Girl Lauren Bennett on ""Love Gun"" and happily shares it with Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's Philip Bailey on ""Fool For You"". The aptly named ""Old Fashioned"" is the most overtly old-school production on the disc, its call-and-response backing vocals and swooning strings relics of another time, but in the context of the disc it's less a flashback than a reverential reference point.</p>
<p>If the <i>de rigueur</i> synthetic frills keep <i>The Lady Killer</i> from the visceral, tactile highs of the current soul revival, they do remind that artifice can often be its own reward. That is, no one will put on <i>The Lady Killer</i> when they want to hear soul music. They'll put it on when they want to hear Cee-Lo's contemporary, confident conception of soul music, which isn't inherently inferior, just different-- and at its best, infectious. If he's not always lethal, that doesn't make him any less of an expert marksman.</p></div>"|14852.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14852-the-lady-killer/|7.3|Joshua Klein

By the time Britpop became an actual going concern, Suede were simply grandfathered in; and when the whole thing spittered to its post-Oasis peak, Suede were considered washed up. But in 1993, they were the creators of the fastest-selling debut LP in UK history and had been anointed as saviors of British indie before their debut single, ""The Drowners"", even hit the shops. This made them a natural for the British press to create ideas around, and so when <i>Select</i> argued for a return to wit, artifice, glamor, and British art school traditions, Suede were easy avatars for those hopes.</p>
<p>Wit, artifice, and glamor may have been foreign to bands like Oasis or Cast or Ocean Colour Scene, but for many in 1993 they were welcome respites from a hangover of faceless, egoless electronic producers and gruff, dour American arena rock. On the relative margins of UK music, Tricky and PJ Harvey and the Tindersticks lurked-- and the Aueturs and Saint Etienne were also considered prototypical British hopes-- but Suede could articulate the desires of the outsider while broadcasting over Radio 1. Like Pulp, although perhaps neither band would be into the comparison, Suede were a more acceptable and easy to grasp Big New Thing. And, also like Pulp, they were comfortable creating complex pop songs about human relationships-- fluid with notions of sexuality and openly pursuant of lust and animal drives in an demure indie world that favors flowers and letters. Try to imagine, for example, Jarvis Cocker or Brett Anderson wooing someone by making them a mixtape?</p>
<p>Unusually, however, they were introspective about the whole thing too. While American glam revivalists like the Dandy Warhols wallowed in a clichÃ©Â of leather jackets and rock'n'roll decadence, Suede inhabited those worlds at night and seemed to be able make some sense of the consequences and their motivations in the light of day. They did epic and visceral but they also did delicate and tortured. These twin poles-- crunchy glam rock and fragile balladeering-- found them at their best. They slipped when they lived between those worlds, aiming for the midtempo and MOR. As a result, there's a lot to admire about Suede, and a lot to ridicule, and they typically go hand in hand. In the end, Suede had no tribal allegiances, and few nationalistic desires; they were essentially fueled by youth, low-rent glamor, available drugs, cheap thrills, and the hangover and harm one gets from their pursuit. If they romanticized anything, it was being young and bored and free. Ordinariness was the enemy.</p>
<p>The group was undoubtedly at its best during its first few years, when guitarist Bernard Butler was still acting as ambitious musical foil to singer Brett Anderson's anguished, romantic lyricist, and this is reflected on the new 2xCD collection <i>The Best of Suede</i>. The first disc of the set is essentially a replay of their singles collection, dropping a few late inessentials; the second is a very well-chosen selection of album tracks and B-sides from throughout their career, but mostly from the era surrounding the band's 1993 self-titled debut and 1994's <i>Dog Man Star</i>, which was finished without Butler after a walkout over creative differences.</p>
<p>On the whole then, this provides a pretty complete, accurate picture of who Suede were, something that would have been incomplete without that second disc. The group's singles tend to fall into the glam-rock half of their work; it's disc two that elevates this set into something special, and into all the Suede that most people will ever need. In hindsight, it's striking how little the band fit into the landscape that coalesced around it. The band's first five singles-- ""The Drowners"", ""Metal Mickey"", ""Animal Nitrate"", ""So Young"", and ""Stay Together""-- and their B-sides (five of which are here) foisted a charismatic, direct group onto the UK's shoegaze- and Madchester-soaked indie scene of the years prior.</p>
<p>In the end, Britpop soon became about a desperate need to fit in; Suede made great pains, for a time, to stand out. The protracted <i>Dog Man Star</i> sessions left the band in a few pieces, but the sheer scale and willingness to work without a net was at odds with most of their peers. The resulting record is full of pomp or pomposity depending on whom you ask, and there are no apologies for it here: The band wisely include the full, widescreen 20-minute run of ""The 2 of Us"", ""The Asphalt World"", and ""Still Life"" on this compilation.</p>
<p>After the departure of Butler, Suede again kicked against fashion: Unlike their pioneering peers, however-- Blur looked west for their self-titled 1997 album; Pulp made a hangover record-- they eased into the second phase of their career by retreating to their past. When guitarist Bernard Butler split to put together one great single with David McAlmont, and little else, Suede hired Richard Oakes, a 17-year-old Bulter acolyte located through their fanclub. Oakes did his best Butler-circa-<i>Suede</i> impersonation on their comeback LP <i>Coming Up</i>, and Anderson shifted into self-parody on a few of his lyrics. The band got by on hooks and gumption, and oddly became a bigger success than ever, enjoying five Top 10 singles in the UK and taking off throughout the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>Retracing their steps was naturally a sloppy affair creatively, however, with second-hand retreads and just plain gaffes. Another weak album later, and a comeback that few remember, filled out the rest of the group's career, and although the cherry-picked songs from those sessions sound better here in retrospect, nobody was going to break sales records or receive early hype based on the strength of something like ""Everything Will Flow"". These few songs are here to make up the numbers and provide a complete picture. And this is a complete picture: This is one of the most warts-and-all bands of our time-- their risk/reward divide was off the charts. In today's more timid climate, it would be almost unthinkable.</p></div>"|14853.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14853-the-best-of-suede/|8.7|Scott Plagenhoef

Although there were dollops of feedback to be found in 2008's ""Lo-Fi Boom"" (Vivian Girls, Times New Viking, Eat Skull), these days the term more often defines the recent (and, seemingly, never-ending) crop of Brooklyn and New Jersey-based bands whose fey, slackened guitar rock sounds distanced from where the listener is at that very moment. This has a good deal to do with the bands' basement recording techniques, as well as the liberal use of reverb and echo whenever possible. The music's prepared to sound dusty and sepia-toned, even if it's fresh off the mastering boards, and it's an approach that's losing its charm fast.</p>
<p>Weekend, then, are arriving at just the right time. Although no one's going to mistake the San Francisco noise-pop trio's Slumberland debut, <i>Sports</i>, for an album produced at Abbey Road, the record is everything that a lot of modern indie rock is frequently failing to be in 2010: loud, immediate, and engaging, with a strong melodic sense of songwriting to tie it all together. That last facet could just as easily be applied to a number of bands in San Francisco, a location that's quickly threatening to eclipse Brooklyn in the ranks of regional talent. There are a few bands that certainly share similar sonic elements (the Fresh &amp; Onlys, Ty Segall, Girls, and a good deal of the Castle Face garage-rock scene), but many of these bands otherwise possess their own distinctive brand of sound and songcraft.</p>
<p>Weekend's cited influences are relatively straightforward and unsurprising once you're familiar with their sound: <i>Loveless</i>, <i>Unknown Pleasures</i>, <i>Disintegration</i>, <i>Psychocandy</i>. Sometimes, those influences quite literally rear their head on <i>Sports</i>-- the Joy Division-recalling misery of ""Landscape"", the JAMC dirty-needle noise bursts of ""Youth Haunts""-- but mostly, the band's innate compositional skills and excellent melodic ears are a testament to their love for the accessible ""canon"" albums like the ones mentioned within the genre the band's devoted to.</p>
<p>This <i>is</i> a Slumberland release, so there's a good deal of fuzz-pop here, too; however, moments that recall that still in-vogue sound aren't presented as-is-- rather, they're recontextualized to fit Weekend's dense, screeching sonic swirl. In case you haven't gotten it yet, <i>Sports</i> is loud as all hell, as even the sweetest melodies (the doe-eyed blare of ""End Times"", especially) are surrounded with a maelstrom of negative sonic waves, which can be attributed to the band's focus on the lower end of things.</p>
<p>Despite its dark, static-charged sound, <i>Sports</i> carries a sense of longing and sad-eyed struggle as well. This is expressed through Shaun Durkan's droning flail of a voice, which remains unintelligible for a good deal of the record but revs up with clarity at key phrases: ""I awoke from a coma summer,"" ""Something deep inside of me turned on"" Underneath it all, the melodies sound wistful, and at times, nostalgic. The latter word's earned a negative connotation over the past 18 months or so, as much of indie's fixations have turned to unearned remembrances of past times, like old photographs picked up at a garage sale. Think of <i>Sports</i>, then, as a freshly taken Polaroid with a lit cigarette stuck straight in the middle of it-- a burning hole bridging the distance between then and right now.</p></div>"|14837.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14837-sports/|8.2|Larry Fitzmaurice

But while the sun-dappled synths, warm guitar tones, and smeared vocals of Nic Zwart's latest project are familiar building blocks, the sum total of this self-titled debut is more than mere pastiche.</p>
<p>Zwart is best known as the frontman for the recently disbanded Desolation Wilderness, which had an unhurried, Galaxie 500-inspired delivery. Both of that group's main albums, <i>New Universe </i>and <i>White Light Strobing</i>, were tranquil with suggestions of more exuberant, poppy songwriting either outright or under the surface. Zwart takes steps into more energetic and engaging territory on <i>Electric Sunset</i>, dialing up tempos and introducing driving interplay between stripped-down guitar melodies and synths. You can hear his musical progression on ""Morning City"", with passages of echoing  vocals setting up gentle peaks with crosscurrents of guitar. He still knows how to linger on a note, like the organ-like tones and bass hum of the slow burning ""Soda"", but there's more lift and propulsion with his solo project, airy instead of just misty.</p>
<p>It's soft-focus psychedelic pop that can feel suspended as it gets blissed-out, since Zwart's simple and gradual rhythms don't offer many surprises, and his voice, placed a bit back in the mix, could be more engaging. For every track that develops forward momentum-- ""Palace"" recalls the bubbly sheen and exuberance of Atlas Sound's ""Walkabout"", and ""Future Dream"" also achieves a Bradford Cox vibe-- there are parts that feel a bit restrained. Zwart's melodies often settle into a slow-motion beauty, but as a whole they'd benefit from a bit more kick, a few explosions instead of just the big crescendos. The album's nine songs clock in at a concise 32 minutes, but the impression they leave is more general.</p>
<p>Created as Zwart moved from the northwest to San Francisco, <i>Electric Sunset</i> channels that optimistic feeling of the newly arrived, wistful for the past but relishing the blank slate. When he sings, ""Lose myself in the cities/ Alone among many,"" on ""Prayer"", it doesn't sound like a lament. But as peaceful as he comes across, it also doesn't sound like he's fully settled into his routine or his new sound.</p></div>"|14839.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14839-electric-sunset/|6.7|Patrick Sisson

In many ways, this is a good thing, wonderful as Neu! were.  Bands who name themselves after songs by other bands already often have a tendency to be glorified cover acts. Not so much with Seeland, whose two members (Tim Felton and Mike ""Billy"" Bainbridge) come from long-running bands (Broadcast and Plone) with distinct signatures of their own, and so their combined efforts bring together a number of sounds from roughly the same <i>era</i> as their namesake (early synth adventures, psychedelic rock, experimental electronic film and TV scores), making records where you can name the influences without necessarily using the word ""homage"" unflatteringly.</p>
<p>Seeland actually trot out Neu!'s motorik beat once, on ""Black Dot, White Spider"", the first song on <i>How to Live</i>, but most of the band's second album is much harder to pin down, its nostalgic sci-fi pop references more cleverly combined, thanks to Felton and Bainbridge's seemingly effortless ability to meld sounds from different musical spheres into catchy little wholes. Is it folk music if beat coffee shops had been bumping to the <i>Forbidden Planet</i> soundtrack? The British Invasion if Joe Meek had been as big an influence as Muddy Waters? The Beta Band with all the wooly psychedelic edges and bad jokes removed, leaving only a sleek but sorta anonymous retro tunefulness? Plone and Broadcast minus the disquieting touches that made their ""childlike"" music hover beguilingly on the edge of creepiness?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that uniform cuddliness is actually one of the album's two big weaknesses. It's all very pretty, very lush, and exceedingly well executed on its own terms. But Seeland's songs are also so unflaggingly adorable and friendly and tightly constructed that you wind up longing for just a moment of abrasion or eeriness or chaos. They do one mood, gentle wide-eyed wonder set to slightly kitschy ""futuristic"" music, very well. But that one mood also wears you out in far less time than the album's 34 minutes. It also all sounds a hell of a lot like Seeland's <i>first</i> album <i>Tomorrow Today</i>, released just last year, which is wonderful for people completely charmed by this stuff and a bit of a ""so what?"" proposition for those who already got their fix a year ago.</p>
<p>The band's other, related stumbling block is that Tim Felton is pretty monochrome behind the mic, to the point where you wonder if an instrumental album might not have been a better showcase of the duo's skills. (At least <i>How to Live</i> wouldn't sound <i>so</i> much likeÂ <i>Tomorrow Today</i> then.) As a singer, Felton delivers great melodies with the same off-the-rack indie wistfulness on each of the album's 10 tracks, the vocal equivalent to the music's constant happy-sad vibe. His voice is acceptably pretty but not much more, and seriously lacking for dynamics, making <i>How to Live</i> feel repetitive despite the sparkling, slippery variety of backing tracks. Seeland's sound, full of bright and perfectly recreated period touches, has plenty of personality on its own. But if they're committed to writing songs, they still need to find a singer to match.</p></div>"|14854.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14854-how-to-live/|5.5|Jess Harvell

It was a set of four half-hour performances by four different bands, recorded in Kinshasa, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), in 1978. It was the first time Kinshasa street music ever made it out of Africa, but the timing wasn't quite right; pre-Internet, word of mouth could only spread this music so far. And it was up against a mainstream world music industry that didn't prize rawness or real African soundworlds. It went out of print, but if you can find it, it is very worth hearing.</p>
<p>But that music couldn't stay hidden forever. In 2004, producer Vincent Kenis curated an album by one of those street bands that had been recorded in 1978, Konono NÂº1, for Crammed Discs (they also recorded a live LP for Terp that year). Konono in 2004 sounded almost exactly like Konono in 1978-- a bracing mix of headlong rhythm and interesting texture, created by found-object percussion and crudely electrified likembe thumb pianos. This time, the timing (and let's be honest, the marketing) were much more fortuitous. KononoÂ NÂº1Â crash-landed in the Western indie rock and avant garde worlds and were embraced wholeheartedly, and Crammed embarked on a series of ""Congotronics"" releases aimed at building a broader picture of Kinshasa's vibrant street music scene, which is comprised of bands from ethnic groups around Congo who amplify their traditional music to be heard over the urban din.</p>
<p>Their latest Congotronics project takes a different tack. There's no doubt that <i>Congotronics</i> has had an impact in the West, and Crammed's Marc Hollander (who long ago was Kenis' partner in the band Aksak Maboul) asked 26 artists to contribute their own personal takes on Congotronics, and contributed one himself under his old Aksak Maboul banner. These artists took a variety of approaches: some wrote original music, some covered actual Congotronics songs or used parts of them as raw musical material, some sampled the source material, and others wrote music modeled on a specific piece. Each song is credited to the artist ""vs"" the Congotronics act that inspired the song (usually Konono or Kasai Allstars), and it's a hugely diverse, double-disc grab-bag by a group of contributors from Europe, the U.S., and Japan.</p>
<p>Some tracks are related to their inspiration more in spirit than anything else. A good example is Tussle's spectacular funk workout ""Soft Crush"", which has a very loose relationship to KononoÂ NÂº1, dropping ethereal thumb piano patterns into its otherwise relentless stomp. Bear Bones and Lay Low's ""Kuletronics"" is like Congotronics via the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, directly quoting KononoÂ NÂº1's ""Kule Kule"", but transposing the likembe groove to odd, throbbing bass sounds and sprinkling the mix liberally with pinging sound effects and filtered, echoing noises. It's interesting to hear the inherent similarities between things that seem as disparate as, say, Konono and Andrew Bird. Bird's pizzicato violin loops on ""Ohnono/Kiwembo"" are nothing too out of the ordinary for him, but it's amazing how well the interlocking patterns he creates reflect an affinity with the band's likembe patterns.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other highlights, from Shackleton's 10-minute, spaced-out ""Mukuba Special"", which features vocal interjections sampled from KasaÃ¯Â Allstars, to Jherek Bischoff's very literal, amazingly heavy orchestral arrangement of ""Kule Kule"". AU's ""Two Labors"" is a crazy pile-up of as many likembe rhythm patterns as possible playing at breakneck speed, while Oneida sucks the music into its own noisy psychedelic world. Juana Molina is one of several who adds vocals and lyrics of her own, bouncing her own melody off the patterns of KasaÃ¯Â Allstars, whose call and response chants she samples into her own composition.</p>
<p>Hollander has afforded each artist the chance to talk a little bit about his or her contribution, and reading the range of thoughts behind the tracks here makes for an interesting companion activity to listening. There are certainly ways a project like this could have gone wrong-- everybody avoids the biggest one, which would have been for a Western artist to try and perform the chants in the original music-- but the artists involved were given enough free reign and seem to have enough genuine appreciation for the music that the final result is a very pleasing listen that captures some of the spirit of the music without outright imitating or caricaturing it.</p></div>"|14841.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14841-tradi-mods-vs-rockers-alternative-takes-on-congotronics/|8.1|Joe Tangari

<p>At its best <i>Good Humor</i> capably splits the difference between old Etienne and new, embracing the 1960s as fervently as ever on ""Split Screen"" and ""The Bad Photographer"" while adopting that era's studio vernacular-- brass, vibes, electric piano. It also maintains the band's trademark melancholy streak with songs like ""Mr. Donut"", ""Postman"", and ""Lose That Girl"".

<p>Over the course of its next few releases, Saint Etienne gradually returned to form, in a literal sense, bringing back the synths and drum machines to bolster its vision of the sad side of the swinging 60s and returning to London as its inspirational wellspring, a shift culminating with 2005's <i>Tales From Turnpike House</i>, the most recent new Saint Etienne album to date. Pairing the <i>Tales </i>reissue withÂ <i>Good Humor</i> is slightly ironic: The latter album finds the band looking beyond its base, but the former is possibly the most ""British"" thing the band has done, a concept album set in an Islington high-rise flat whose fictional residents provide song-fodder that ranges from the kitchen-sink quotidian to the whimsical.</p>
<p>This deluxe edition features the original UK tracklist-- in the words of Nitsuh Abebe's review, ""one smooth, seamless thing"" that remains as strong an entry into Saint Etienne's world as just about anything in its portfolio (and not just because the chart-minded British production team Xenomania had a hand in a couple of its tracks). Unlike the clearinghouse-minded bonus disc ofÂ <i>Good Humor</i>, the second disc of <i>Tales From Turnpike House</i> includes several unreleased songs. Sadly, it's missing the album's attendant EP of would-be children's music <i>Up the Wooden Hills</i> as well as some other esoterica.

<p>It's helpful that these deluxe editions and their dusted off studio discoveries should arrive now, with the band relatively inactive, as there's a whole lot of worthwhile music to be absorbed and reassessed.

While there have been some personnel shifts-- the rhythm section on <i>Pyramid of the Sun</i> isn't the same one the group had eight years ago-- that only scratches the surface in what's changed with the group. It takes more than just plugging in a new guitarist and drummer to go from making serviceable instrumental music in a mathematical vein to talk-boxed space-bound synth-prog. The latter sound is more in line with what instrumental duo Zombi coax from their Moogs, and Zombi's Steve Moore does indeed make a few appearances on <i>Pyramid</i>. And even though Zombi and Maserati did share some wax last year on a split EP, that Maserati would go so far as to emulate Zombi's sounds-- more specifically, the sounds that Zombi themselves emulate-- probably wasn't a move most would have expected.</p>
<p><i>Pyramid</i> covers a fair amount of ground over the course of its eight tracks, from the Jan Hammer moves on the Moore-abetted ""Oaxaca"" to the more familiar rock-based grooves laid down for ""We Got the System to Fight the System"". The man who makes Maserati most able to cover this wide swath of territory is the late Jerry Fuchs. When Fuchs joined the band on the drums for 2007's <i>Inventions for the New Season</i>, his impact was felt immediately. His playing, powerful and precise while also exhibiting a little looseness, provided a solid foundation that gave the rest of the group the space to explore and expand their horizons. On <i>Pyramid</i>, that solid base takes on a more motorik feel. On something scuzzy like the short and sweet ""Ruins"", it creates an air that harkens back to early Trans Am (specifically <i>The Surveillance</i>). On a shinier tune like ""They'll No More Suffer From Thirst"", Fuchs' machine-like accuracy fits in perfectly with the pastel-colored synths and scratchy guitar. Throughout the album, Fuchs' playing is exemplary, but not in a showy or needlessly florid manner; he simply gets to work and gets the job done, content with being just one part of a greater whole.</p>
<p>Fittingly, Fuchs' finest moment on <i>Pyramid</i>, ""Bye M'Friend, Goodbye"", is also his most workman-like. At first, the track has a hymn-like feel, with wordless sonorous moaning happening in front of an arpeggiating synthesizer and a slowly shaken tambourine. Soon guitars enter the fray, offering polite yet cheerful counterpoint to the track's solemnity. Finally, fading in from the background, is Fuchs; his slowly approaching beat opens up the song, transforming the song's processional gait into a joyous and exuberant sprint. And while his bandmates cavort and canter with glee, there's Fuchs, doing his job, making it all possible. This song is as fine a tribute and send-off as one could hope for, and is an equally appropriate way to draw the curtain on this phase of Maserati's career.</p></div>"|14842.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14842-pyramid-of-the-sun/|7.4|David Raposa

Bay Area trio Royal Baths have an affinity for that decade, too-- only a different, darker part of it. Their debut full-length, <i>Litanies</i>, draws from the noisier, more freaked-out side of early garage rock. It also takes cues from Neil Young's lightning-struck guitar sermons and the Velvet Underground's creeping paranoia. The band's singers, Jeremy Cox and Jigmae Baer, favor a dual-voiced delivery that sounds likeÂ the VU's multi-narrative sonic puzzle ""The Murder Mystery"".</p>
<p>But for all the backward-looking signifiers, there are some strangely coincidental present-day similarities, too: Cox and Baer's pitched voices and cracked delivery recall Woods' Jeremy Earl, whose Woodsist label is issuing <i>Litanies</i>. And the album'sÂ psych-damaged sound brings to mind yet another Woodsist band-- the skronk-loving Moon Duo. Unlike that group, however, Royal Baths let their melodies shine through the muck, instead of burying them in swampy riffage. Before it folds into a deadened dirge, ""Nikki Don't"" is sprightly, with lightly delivered ""ba ba ba""s and a touch of bells. Those ""ba ba ba""s emerge again in one of <i>Litanies</i>' highlights, ""I Detest"", and they cut through that song's doomy chords with sharpness. <i>Litanies</i>' melodies don't struggle with the darker moments; instead, they work within and alongside them.</p>
<p>Still much of <i>Litanies</i> sounds blackened both by the distancing effects of the production quality and by the sheer maelstrom of Cox and Baer's guitar fuzz. Their lyrics often contribute to this shadowed atmosphere: ""Sitting in My Room"" starts off as a promise (""In the morning/ The morning will be there/ And we're not there yet/ But we'll get there"") that turns into a plea, ""Here I am/ I am high/ And I'm too high to/ Go to bed.""Â Even the innocuously titled ""Pleasant Feeling"" seems to be about the inward effects of heroin use, with the post-injection entreaty to ""Close the doors/ The light's too bright."" The darkness suits these folks better anyway.</p></div>"|14843.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14843-litanies/|7.5|Larry Fitzmaurice

Bluegrass grows more in the foothills, folk is too broad, string-band too restrictive, and old-timey implies a deep disconnection from the present. In the extensive liner notes to their second album, the Black Twig Pickers wisely avoid any of these terms. The music is simply music, as much a part of the here-and-now as anything else in Virginia and West Virginia. The band, who backed Jack Rose on an album last year, remain academic-minded, proudly apprenticing themselves to older musicians from the region. In those liners, band member Mike Gangloff recounts the provenance of some of the old songs they play as well as the geneses of their two originals, hinting that the past hangs over the band just by virtue of the style of music they play.</p>
<p>Yet, for the Black Twig Pickers steeping themselves in history doesn't dampen the impact of the music-- it magnifies it. <i>Ironto Special</i> is no dry, studious affair: Named after a mountain town in southwest Virginia, the album is raw and boisterous, sometimes showy and sometimes restrained but always spirited in its execution. The trio may not be the most dexterous pickers, but they wisely emphasize energy over exactness, whether they're playing a barnburner like ""Don't Drink Nothing But Corn"" or a slower number like ""Smoker Wedding March"". If you listen carefully, you might hear a flub or two, but that only contributes to the ramshackle vibe of the album.</p>
<p>From the almost spry bounce of ""Pickin' Out the Devil's Eyes"" to the military processional of ""Rockin' in a Weary Land"", the Pickers play a range of settings, showing how diverse the region and its traditions can be. Then they add a few touches of their own: Nathan Bowles plays the bones on ""Dead Man's Piece"", and the simple rhythms offsets the froggy harmonica and spare banjo, as if ticking off the minutes of a life. That, Gangloff writes in the liners, is a funeral song, and it's followed by a wedding march, creating the album's best sequence. While he bows a springtime reel on ""Smoker Wedding March"", Bowles drums on the fiddle strings with chopsticks.</p>
<p>Much of <i>Ironto Special</i> is instrumental, highlighting the close interplay between the guitars, banjos, washboards, and mouth harps. Oddly, the only instrument that doesn't seem to belong is the human voice. The Pickers trade off vocals on just a few songs and whoop and holler on others. Isak Howell fares best on ""Lay Ten Dollars Down"", his phrasing suggestive of a drunken stagger, but in general, they all sound like they're straining toward some tumbledown genre ideal rather than letting it come as naturally as the rest of the music. In general, though, the Pickers show a firm and confident grasp of the traditions they're participating in and-- more importantly-- of the relevance of this unnamed genre to the present-day.</p></div>"|14820.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14820-ironto-special/|7.2|Stephen M.

However, it's rare that these solo sojourns wind up eclipsing the work of the mothership act, and even rarer when they reveal the singer-dude's fondness for lipstick and eyeliner, facility with choreographed dance routines, and eagerness to call his sexuality into question. For those who aren't familiar with John O'Regan's workmanlike post-punk outfit the D'Urbervilles-- and, lamentably, few people outside the Toronto-Montreal indie-rock corridor are-- the magnitude of his transformation into lo-fi glitter god Diamond Rings can be quantified as such: imagine Britt Daniel decided one day that he really wanted to be Lady Gaga.</p>
<p>Alas, the Diamond Rings story has decidedly unglamorous origins-- the concept was born in a Toronto hospital bed, where O'Regan spent summer 2008 battling a sudden, severe onset of Crohn's disease, using the recovery time to write new songs on guitar and keyboards. Many people who've endured invasive medical procedures often feel the desire to reclaim control of their bodies by marking them with tattoos or piercings; it's thus instructive to view O'Regan's metamorphosis from indie-rock everyman into the flamboyant Diamond Rings not as some premeditated, shock-value provocation, but as a process of trading in his scarred, sickly body for a more physically pristine one.</p>
<p>The heavily YouTubed 2009 single ""All Yr Songs"" was Diamond Rings' proverbial coming-out party, showcasing O'Regan's newly mascaraed visage and a sweet boombox serenade several degrees warmer and more affectionate than the D'Urbervilles' spiky new wave. But on his long-gestating full-length debut, <i>Special Affections</i>, O'Regan is less interested in blurring gender lines as toying with extreme contrasts of masculinity and femininity, pitting his authoritative baritone, aggressive electric-guitar strums, and bald, cutting sentiments against silken slow-jam arrangements, radiant synth lines, and twinkling tinker-toy beats.</p>
<p>Pretty much every line on <i>Special Affections</i> can be read as O'Regan's coming to terms with his new persona-- whether he's ""covering [his] conscience with a new disguise"" on the austere, piano-laced opener ""Play by Heart"", or declaring his intent to ""write my own story, make it all up as I go"" on the crunk&amp;B crunch of ""You Oughta Know"". But unlike other artists who've crafted album-length narratives around a new guise-- from Bowie to BeyoncÃ©-- Diamond Rings is a vehicle through which O'Regan can more candidly address the sensitive matters in his own personal life, effectively equating the awkward feeling of wearing make-up in public for the first time to other intimately discomfiting scenarios, be it the painful realization that a relationship is over (""Pre-Owned Heart"") or the fear of acting on suppressed lust (""Give It Up""). When O'Regan sings, ""I'm feeling like a bit-part actor"" on the click-tracked fuzz-pop of ""Wait &amp; See"", you can tell he's got matters on his mind far weightier than how his rainbow face-paint looks.</p>
<p>But as fascinating as it is to hear an indie rock artist step outside of his comfort zone, both musically and emotionally, <i>Special Affections</i>' skeletal electro-pop sketches routinely fortify into full-blooded anthemic choruses that make O'Regan's liberation your own. (The fact that O'Regan never lets on whether he's singing to a boy or a girl further emphasizes its universal applications.) In rock music, the traditional litmus test of a song's strength is whether it holds up to an acoustic-guitar reading; with <i>Special Affections</i>, O'Regan-- who claims he's still committed to keeping the D'Urbervilles a going concern-- simply applies the same logic to his GarageBand presets. And on an album full of sturdy sing-alongs, none stands taller than ""Something Else"", a scrappy power-pop triumph that plays like a more natural, better executed version of the synthed-up Strokes experiment that Julian Casablancas attempted on <i>Phrazes for the Young</i>.</p>
<p>Not one to forget who brought him to the dance, O'Regan drops ""All Yr Songs"" into the final-song slot. But after the preceding nine tracks documenting difficult break-ups and tawdry hook-ups, the gesture feels less like a case of saving the hit for last and more of a time-capsule farewell to Diamond Rings' more innocent origins. And since early versions of <i>Special Affections</i> started circulating as far back as last March, O'Regan has pomped up even further with the big-room Euro-house flourishes and Britney-ized bump'n'grind of recent, non-album single ""Show Me Your Stuff"". But even if Diamond Rings' rapidly evolving aesthetic has already moved beyond <i>Special Affections</i>' bedsit R&amp;B, the album still stands as an exemplary model of how one can live out blinged-out fantasies on a cubic zirconia budget.</p></div>"|14829.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14829-special-affections/|8.2|Stuart Berman

Name recognition will ensure a certain number of people will pay attention to your new music and come out to shows. Hell, some bands, such as Pink Floyd and Genesis, became only more successful after their charismatic original singer left the group. So there's that. Mostly, however, it's a terrible idea. You run the risk of alienating your audience and tarnishing your legacy. Your new music never gets a fair chance, since it's always going to be compared unfavorably to your past glories. It's hard to grasp why the remaining members of the Concretes ever made this foolish gamble.</p>
<p><i>WYWH</i> is the second Concretes album without singer Victoria Bergsman, who left to follow her own muse with Taken By Trees. Though the Concretes were always a large band, and current singers Lisa Milberg and Maria Eriksson have been in the group all along, there is no getting around the reality that Bergsman's unmistakable voice was the most attractive and interesting thing about their music. On their brilliant self-titled debut, her heavily accented, painfully introverted presence clicked with the band's Velvet Underground-meets-Motown sound in a way that was unique and magical. Without Bergsman as an anchor, the Concretes have no particular identity. Milberg and Eriksson are good vocalists but are lacking in character, and the songwriting has become rather generic, at least in terms of icy Scandinavian indie music. It may be mostly the same musicians, but it's just not the same band that produced gems like ""You Can't Hurry Love"" and ""Diana Ross"". Carrying on as the Concretes is at least somewhat dishonest, like an artistic bait-and-switch.</p>
<p>In an alternate reality in which <i>WYWH</i> was released under a band name other than the Concretes, it would still be a mediocre effort, but it would at least be easier to appreciate it on its own terms. The group's attempts at a more danceable sound on ""Good Evening"" and ""All Day"" are modestly successful and flatter Milberg's understated vocal style. Despite solid musicianship, however, their grooves are often rather limp, and many of their disco moves are only theoretically conducive to actual dancing. The album maintains a pleasing and mellow atmosphere, but the tone isn't very evocative. Whereas their earliest work brought to mind a surreal winter wonderland, this music seems oddly blank. It feels like being nowhere, and not in an interesting sort of way. The problem here isn't to do with craft-- these are reasonably okay compositions performed by a band of talented professionals-- but it could be a matter of passion and commitment. There's no sense of emotional stakes on the album, and there isn't any strong feeling to connect with either way. To some extent, <i>WYWH</i> can get by on vibe, but really, a listener can do much better, even without going further back into the Concretes catalog.</p></div>"|14832.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14832-wywh/|4.1|Matthew Perpetua

He's a visual artist turned musician, he shared an apartment building with mentors Flying Lotus and Samiyam, and he put together his first Brainfeeder release, <i>Ardour</i>, over a two-year stretch that saw his father pass away. Run in certain beat-geek circles, and you might start getting an idea of what his deal is just from those details. But who Teebs knows, how he came up, the creation process, what scenes he's echoing off and adding to-- well, it's important, but there's something about <i>Ardour</i> that makes it feel like it has no manmade origin. Think of a building that's been left unattended for 100 years, and all of the foliage that pushes up through it and engulfs its crumbling foundations. For all the artisanal care that went into this album's creation, it sounds like decaying beats being split apart by deceptively fragile yet resilient melodies, post-hip-hop production as a simulation of nature reclaiming concrete.</p>
<p>Here's what I mean: try and focus on a specific instrument when you listen to an individual track, and you'll discover that Teebs' manipulation has rendered it into something unexpected. That's a wobbly harp on ""Double Fifths"", though in the first few seconds of the loop getting spooled up, it sounds like an out-of-tune ukulele, and over the course of the song its off-time loops start to come across as precipitation rather than a set of strings. There's a trilling piano glissando on ""Moments"", tweaked at points-- drenched in reverb, distorted, subsumed under layers of percussion and hiss-- to halfway convince you into thinking it might not actually be a piano at all. Percussive elements are built in a way that puts kicks and snares front and center, but lets just enough supplemental backbeat elements like backspun loops, flowing chimes, and sparking electronic synapses bubble under the surface so that even the most minimalist rhythms sound mystifyingly busy. Such elements make songs like ""My Whole Life"" and ""Wind Loop"" into drum-rich tracks that sinuously trickle instead of straight-up banging.</p>
<p>A lot of ink and pixels have been thrown around trying to make a case for the idea of electronic music's organic possibilities, but <i>Ardour</i> actually captures the sonic equivalent of watching biological life expand in sped-up time-lapse. And no, that's not to say that <i>Ardour</i> is about as interesting as watching grass grow. Its methodology is subtle, but its mood is immediate. Maybe the best way I can think of to describe that tone is one of disorienting joy: It's wispy and gentle and a bit cheerful on the surface, but giving it a deep listen will bring forth some of the more complex and abrasive elements to the forefront. This music can be flat-out beautiful while still giving your head a jostle: The romantic soundtrack strings of ""Humming Birds"", the icy bells of ""Arthur's Birds"", and the digital bird-chirps of ""Autumn Antique"" are undercut by clicking snap-beats and bass throbs that sound like they're coming from a loose, twitching high-voltage power line. That juxtaposition of gentleness and heat makes <i>Ardour</i> a pleasant exercise in loop-chopping naturalism-- but even through all the foliage, you can still nod your head to it.</p></div>"|14798.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14798-ardour/|8.0|Nate Patrin

Something about their churning, groaning drone seems to settle over time: The off-kilter rhythms find their bearings, the jokes get funnier, your brain adjusts to their crazy. This winter's sprawling, unusually solid 2xCDÂ <i>Presidence</i> underscored this; the further they dug in, the more fertile their excursions. <i>LATE</i>, their latest, is a series of shorter textural explorations, light on any perceivable comedy (at this point, perhaps the other Excepter mainstay). But <i>LATE</i>'s relative brevity proves its undoing; every time Excepter seem poised to hit on something, it's all over.</p>
<p>Opener ""OBOH"" is a nightmare trip of whirrs and howls, an undulating three-second convulsion repeated over and over. It's wonderfully nauseating, caustic, and rife with unease, but there's something almost mechanical about the performance; we seem to be plopped down into the middle of a fairly successful, locked-in improvisation, which turns over in much the same way every time its very brief theme is repeated. The best bits come when the elements appear just slightly askew, but those are all too rare, and minute two ends up sounding an awful lot like minute five. There's barely any build, so when the track ends abruptly to make way for ""LAL8"", it's jarring, but almost mercifully so.</p>
<p>""LAL8"" begins and ends with a thin synthetic pulse, an irregular heartbeat that gives the track its forward motion. A buzzy elephant graveyard synth smears through the backdrop as the rhythm intensifies, and the two seem to find each other around minute three, building to a slow but satisfying climax. Whereas ""OBOH"" felt excerpted from something larger, ""LAL8"" is given time and space to stretch out, and its fervid conclusion provides <i>LATE</i> with its peak. This is Excepter at their best, allowing their oddness to come to fruition, to reach its eventual endpoint. No point in being this bizarre if you're not gonna see it all the way through.</p>
<p>""Anastasia"" might be the most disarming thing here; though they've more than dabbled with ghostly dancefloor rhythms before, walk away from ""Anastasia"" a couple minutes in and you could very well convince yourself they've penned their first legit banger. Naturally, things are a little more complicated than that; any notion of cutting a rug turns quickly to cutting up a body, as the track grows busier and far more unsettling as it goes. The song's stutter-shout eventually subsides, giving way to a swaying drone; it's a premature comedown for a novel groove that would've benefitted from a little more stretching out. Closer ""Cat Piss and Licorice"" starts out eerie and diffuse before arriving at an unusually delicate keyboard plink. The track, it seems, is a sort of anti-homage to conversation-ending Internet meme Keyboard Cat; ""the cat piano was cute at first,"" someone moans at one point, ""but now it's on my nerves."" Ditto the joyless ""Cat Piss"", which devolves quickly into mumbling.</p>
<p><i>LATE</i>'s textures are alluringly dingy, its sense of dread palpable, its refusal to sit still a boon. But there's a real unfinished quality to these songs, whether they end too early like ""OBOH"" or simply don't have much going on like ""Cat Piss"". They're certainly capable of working well in miniature-- see the wildly successful <i>Sunbomber</i> EP-- but one can't help but escape the feeling that these are good ideas that simply weren't given enough time to hash themselves out. <i>LATE</i> will find fans among the Excepter loyal, and surely the seed of something biggerÂ has been planted here. Amidst <i>LATE</i>'s many sharp dropoffs and dead ends, however, it's tough to tell just what that might be.</p></div>"|14844.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14844-late-ep/|6.0|Paul Thompson

(Multi-instrumentalists Richard and Alan Bishop did one final tour in 2008 as the Brothers Unconnected, playing material from the SCG songbook, then called it quits.) They made a career out of being unpredictable: If you'd heard the miraculous pancultural freakout of <i>Torch of the Mystics</i> (everyone's favorite SCG album, unforgivably long out of print) and then picked up the sluggish comedy record <i>Jacks Creek</i>, or discovered them through the Fugs-ian ranty-shanties of <i>Horse Cock Phepner</i> and followed that with the space-drone of <i>Bright Surroundings Dark Beginnings</i>, you might have wondered if there were a bunch of <i>different</i> bands calling themselves Sun City Girls. (I'd point neophytes toward the albums that displayed multiple sides of the band, like <i>Kaliflower</i> or <i>Carnival Folklore Resurrection Radio</i>, but those are long-gone too.)</p>
<p>So for their final bow, it's fitting that they took another left turn, this time into overt prettiness. In some ways, <i>Funeral Mariachi</i> is a return to a couple of the modes where they seemed most comfortable-- and this was a band that was usually much more interested in discomfort, even their own. One is pastiches of non-Anglophone folk forms, with singing in made-up languages (sort of an extension of Can's ""Ethnological Forgery Series""); ""The Imam"" and ""Black Orchid"" would've fit right in on <i>Torch of the Mystics</i>. The other is film music, specifically in the tradition of Ennio Morricone. ""Come Maddalena"" is a Morricone cover, and ""Blue West"" and ""Mineral Wells"" might as well be.</p>
<p>Sun City Girls recorded a bunch of ""soundtracks"" over the years--Â <i>Juggernaut</i>, <i>Dulce</i>, <i>Piasa... Devourer of Men</i>-- although <i>Mister Lonely</i> is the only movie they scored that demonstrably exists any place other than their record sleeves. But <i>Funeral Mariachi</i> doesn't need a framing device to evoke an imaginary Jodorowsky movie. Unidentifiable instruments slither in and out of the mix; rhythms trudge like mules along a dirt road. Anything you think you hear might be a lie or an illusion. ""When I was dead I looked exactly like you/ Now I'm alive where nothing is true,"" the Bishops purr on ""This Is My Name"", one of only a couple of songs with much in the way of English lyrics.</p>
<p>The Girls boys always had a very weird sense of humor, and there are a few odd little jokes here: ""Bens Radio"" begins and ends with a terrific bit of studio trickery, volleying snippets of voices across the stereo field, as if channel-surfing, and the unutterably lovely ""El Solo"" alternates Morricone-esque vocalese with halting phrases from a loud, old piano. Mostly, though, the shock of <i>Funeral Mariachi</i> is that it's the friendliest record in their catalogue. It doesn't have the twitching intensity of a lot of their other work-- that's both an asset and a deficit-- but they couldn't have made a sweeter farewell.</p></div>"|14836.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14836-funeral-mariachi/|7.4|Douglas Wolk

The relentless studio tinkerer leaves a lot of process in his music, and his songs have an appealingly imperfect quality. It's not that Caribou tracks feel unfinished; they're more like breathing compositions than polished, flawless objects. This gives remixers a lot of room to maneuver-- they can pick apart individual pieces of songs, expand on one especially interesting element, or even deconstruct the whole thing and start from scratch. And <i>Swim</i> is particularly ripe for reworking because it's easily his clubbiest material to date.</p>
<p>Snaith has never been beholden to one genre and this set honors the exploratory nature of his work. All the artists included are beat-minded in some way, but they vary pretty wildly across the electronic music spectrum. There's indie dance-pop (Walls, Nite Jewel), dubstep/funky (Ikonika), minimal techno (DJ Koze), experimental electronica (James Holden), and more. This healthy cross-section makes the album feel more relevant than similar remix comps, but also makes it a bit clunky. There are a ton of different ideas to internalize, and at 90 minutes, it's just a lot of music to wade through.</p>
<p>Some of the best material comes from unlikely sources. Tucson unknown Altrice made his way onto the record by winning a remix competition, and his ""Only What You Gave Me"" mix of ""Sun"" is easily one of the best cuts. He flips the whole vibe of the track, taking it from skyward psych to a dark head-knodder riding over hip-hop breaks and distorted synths. Fuck Buttons, who took a step toward the floor last year with their monster <i>Tarot Sport</i>, continue in that direction by turning ""Kaili"" into pulsing house. Without even a hint of noise, the track doesn't resemble much of their other work.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Junior Boys knock out the best ""Odessa"" mix, and it's great to hear them back in crisp, electro-funk form. Gold Panda does his tech-y, Eastern-tinged thing on ""Jamelia"", and the UK's Patten live up to their noise-dance hype with their ""Sun"" remix. Somewhere along the line, though, the record loses focus. Dudes you expect to deliver, like Holden and Koze, sprawl way too far out, and at least three other songs just feel unnecessary. With so much material, you almost start to forget about Caribou altogether, and the record becomes more valuable as a dance-cut grab bag than a reflection of the source material. That's neither compliment nor criticism, just what happens when nothing gets edited out.</p></div>"|14824.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14824-swim-remixes/|6.8|Joe Colly

Paul Smith makes it an official trend with <i>Margins</i>; while his band, MaxÃ¯mo Park, didn't quite reach the same level of notoriety, <i>A Certain Trigger </i>is certainly amongst the best of last decade's post-punk revival records. But while Flowers and Kele were able to use their albums as a logical continuation of their band's increasingly flamboyant tendencies,Â MaxÃ¯mo Park have beenÂ leaking momentum for years; by their third album, the songwriting digressed to the point where Smith's bowler hat was the band's most interesting feature.</p>
<p>But even with lower expectations, it's difficult to reconcile the past withÂ <i>Margins</i>. The first two songs ease us in, reminiscent of the underrated ""ballads"" from <i>Our Earthly Pleasures </i>or the melodically cresting, heart-on-sleeve emoting of Frightened Rabbit. From there on out what's most striking is just how much of a <i>solo </i>album this is. The drums are lightly brushed, not pounded, guitars mostly acoustic and lightly trickling from earphone to earphone, Smith's tensile sing-speak is stretched to a Jarvis Cocker croon.  And all of it is softened at the edges by a spacious, hands-off production aesthetic of holistic reverb and roomsound.</p>
<p>Yet while the you-are-there sound of <i>Margins </i>is sympathetic to Smith as a singer, the laconic tempos don't do him many favorsÂ as a songwriter. Nearly every track has some sort of charming bargaining chip-- the gorgeous guitar and knocking knick-knack percussion arrangement of ""This Heat"", the domestic voyeurism of ""While You're in the Bath""-- but the melodies ramble along, never finding their footing.Â And then there are the indulgences-- ""Alone, I Would've Dropped"" is the kind of droning, Middle Eastern experiment most people try once and (rightfully) only once in their career, but ""I Drew You Sleeping"" draws a grand melodic guidance from its silvery Johnny Marr riffs to provide an intriguing glimpse of Smith as a luxuriant mope rather than an acoustic-toting confessor.</p>
<p>Smith himself claimed that making <i>Margins </i>was a result of a ""seven-year itch,"" and it's certainly warranted that the guy who wrote ""Apply Some Pressure"" would want to ease back: As the dominant personality in a band struggling with its direction and, judging from the hurt in the lyrics, smarting from romantic abandonment, a ""sort your shit out"" album is understandable. But ultimately, <i>Margins </i>feels like an album of songs that needed to be exorcised more than shared.</p></div>"|14807.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14807-margins/|5.2|Ian Cohen

Dodging bottles and cups thrown by their rowdy audiences, the trio developed considerable chops before signing with local label Don Giovanni: Jarrett Dougherty is a heavy drummer mercifully spare with fills, ""King Mike"" Abbate a bass player graciously liberal with melody, and Marissa Paternoster a guitar player with an enormous musical vocabulary that includes everything from classic rock to hardcore to New Wave to indie to lo-fi. Punk has traditionally prized attitude over abilities, but Screaming Females have both: Rather than muzzle their ferocity, the band's tight, tense dynamic amplifies the fuck-off stridency of their fourth LP, <i>Castle Talk.</i></p>
<p>There's only one female in the group, but Paternoster earns that plural band name. As a singer, she has a mighty howl that's as regal and haughty as that album title implies. She shreds and wails through these songs, grinds and slashes, often changing battle strategy abruptly. In fact, part of the thrill of listening to <i>Castle Talk</i> is trying to predict what she'll do next, how she'll bend the scouring lick on ""Ghost Solo"" into a song-destroying outro or how she'll turn the menacing riff of ""A New Kid"" inside out. As with her lyrics, Paternoster's guitar playing may sound stream-of-conscious, but there's an internal logic to her fretwork as well as a careful economy that favors sneering repetition of themes and compact solos. Due to gender and contemporaneousness, it's tempting to lump her in with Marnie Stern, but Paternoster has more in common with the Doug Martsch, J Mascis, Carrie Brownstein, and Neil Young (the Females covered ""Cortez the Killer"" on an early single)-- all artists who have subsumed themselves into tight band units yet manage to sound utterly distinctive.</p>
<p>In that regard, the most interesting aspect of <i>Castle Talk</i> is the way Paternoster fulfills her frontwoman status by turning each song into a dialogue-- or, perhaps, an argument-- between voice and guitar. On ""Boss"", she adopts a shaky tone that gives each note a stressed wobble even as she declares, ""I could be the boss of you any day."" The effect is that of a woman steeling herself for a fight, psyching herself up to defy. On the other hand, her guitar swoops in suddenly to punctuate the chorus of ""I Don't Mind It"", adding emphatic certainty to her declaration that ""it's just never enough."" Her riffs alternately underline and undermine her vocals, but she thrives on the conflict between her dual instruments, as well as between herself and the band, the band and the world. That sense of scene survival energizes and innervates these songs: ""I'm joyfully employed and normal!"" she asserts on ""Normal"", as if we might miss that all three of them are enjoying every note.</p></div>"|14835.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14835-castle-talk/|7.9|Stephen M.

Ever-increasing processing power means laptops have long since replaced DATs and sequencers when it comes to replaying pre-recorded material. They're also able to generate and transform new music as the show unfolds, which has given rise to a large network of folks who might've been making wholly improvised music with saxophones and guitars and bent circuitry two decades ago-- and all of this with a <i>much</i> reduced possibility of the kind of crashing and/or freezing that once killed whole concerts.</p>
<p>Where does this leave the first generation of laptop-based improvisers like Fenn O'Berg, the trio of Christian Fennesz, Peter Rehberg, and Jim O'Rourke? Well, the novelty behind the approach is certainly gone, and the sound of a bunch of raw computer glitches strung together and called a ""piece"" is no longer alien enough to be a draw all by itself. The trio may no longer even utilize laptops, or wholly computerized sound, for key portions of their music. But many of the technical limitations and glitches have disappeared-- the ones that made early laptop music so often a frustrating live experience for musician and listener alike.</p>
<p>On the two new <i>Live in Japan</i> discs, which collect performances from 2009, it seems Fenn O' Berg's response to the upgraded capabilities of their consumer electronics has been to grow more traditionally ""musical"" in constructing their live shows, even if what they're presenting is still far from accessible. Grainy gray washes of digital static, burbles like running water, tiny not-quite-melodic motifs that disperse almost cruelly before another wave of corrupted electronic sound: Situated somewhere between form and formlessness, ever-changing and moments of sublime near-static repetition, not always pleasant but far from alienating, <i>Live in Japan</i> is often indistinguishable in places from the fluffier end of pure noise.</p>
<p>But for those who prefer their noise to be more immersive than hair-raising, Fenn O'Berg let their often formless bits of digital data wash together into longer ebbing and flowing compositions that bear some distant relation to other long-form experiences like minimalism or even jazz. It's a bit odd that these discs had their genesis on stage, because this seems like precisely the kind of thing <i>best</i> enjoyed at home, preferably through headphones. With its random bursts of crackle and hiss surrounded by vast gulfs of digital silence, glitch was perfect for both laptops (which often spat these sounds out by accident anyway) and live performance (since there's a certain tense fascination in not knowing when next snarl or blurt is gonna zap your ears).</p>
<p>There's something altogether calmer about these two LPs providing a progressive exploration rather than moment-to-moment jolts, after 10-plus years of mind-melding and in-depth play. But the sound palette retains glitch's top-end harshness, a kind of gnarled and beautiful post-industrial ambient music for noise kids and Mego fans.</p></div>"|14833.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14833-live-in-japan/|6.5|Jess Harvell

At the time, the two producers were lamenting the decline of the cinematic NYC rap they'd both made their names cranking out. But Alchemist talked with a sense of genuine excitement and wonder about a backpack-rap universe that still sounded pretty new to him: ""Not to dis them, but a lot of that shit is kind of weird. But the world that they're repping, that's the world that I want to be a part of."" These days, Alc still has a foot in whatever's left of the mainstream rap world; he produced ""You Ain't Got Nuthin"", probably the hardest track on Lil Wayne's gazillion-selling <i>Tha Carter III</i>, and he DJed a recent run of Eminem stadium shows. But he's also very much a part of that underground world he was talking about. And now he's teamed up with the stalwart Stones Throw rapper/producer Oh No to form the duo Gangrene and crank out a decidedly weird little record.</p>
<p>Alchemist is probably still best-known for crafting gutpunch street-rap anthems for guys like Mobb Deep and Jadakiss, but his early-decade aesthetic is almost entirely gone from <i>Gutter Water</i>. Instead, he's launched himself into the ADD crate-digging style best exemplified by Oh No's older brother Madlib. The tracks on <i>Gutter Water</i> sputter and crackle and warp, rarely settling into a comfortable thump. Horns and strings and harps-- all seemingly drawn from moldy thrift-shop muzak platters-- always circle whatever groove the drums conjure, but the two producers rarely let them fall into the pocket. Tracks rarely come with choruses, and when those choruses are there, they're awkward enough that you wish they weren't. This is a mood piece. There's a lot of texture at work here, and there would be more if the duo didn't end nearly every track by dissolving into a sample-collage of cheesed-out film dialogue and disembodied news-anchor voices.</p>
<p>Even if they're hell on the album's sustained momentum, those collages do pound home the album's theme: disease, squalor, infection. (One news report about people swimming in open sewage makes me want to gag every time.) But this isn't an album about the need for global health reform; the thematic stuff is there to remind you that you're dealing with two people totally uninterested in meeting you halfway. Alchemist even takes the time to remind us that he's not a ""ringtone rapper,"" a term I haven't heard in a while. (Alc must not have got the memo that skinny-jeans rappers are everyone's favorite threat to hip-hop culture these days.)</p>
<p>As rappers, Alc and Oh are both perfectly decent but never transcendent. Oh has a solidly loping delivery, and Alc has a raspy off-beat thing that's less technically sound but more distinctive. And Alc has a way with perfectly ridiculous, kind of dumb punchlines that nonetheless lodge themselves in your memory: ""Speed on and get peed on,"" ""Hopping out the trashcan like Oscar the Grouch,"" ""I stay high like pussy on a giraffe is."" Plenty of guests stop by, but Raekwon notwithstanding, most of them sit firmly in a willfully hardheaded West Coast underground scene: Planet Asia, Evidence, Roc C. Some of them, like Guilty Simpson, work great with the kinds of beats they're given, but nobody dazzles.</p>
<p>But the rapping on <i>Gutter Water</i> is almost beside the point. Oh and Alc are producers first, and <i>Gutter Water</i> would work nearly as well as an instrumental album. And together, they've created a messy, impressive pile-up of half-broken piano loops and dense, clattery drum programming. It's a hazy, stoned piece of work, an expansive extended head-nod, everything it sets out to be.</p></div>"|14717.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14717-gutter-water/|6.7|Tom Breihan

""He played these songs as good as it was possible to play them,"" Dylan writes, adding that, ""What I had to work at, Mike already had in his genes, in his genetic makeup... The thought occurred to me that maybe I'd have to write my own folk songs.""</p>
<p>The 47 songs collected on <i>The Bootleg Series, Vol. 9: The Witmark Demos: 1962-1964</i> allow us to witness how Dylan went about doing just that. Representing the fruits of his first two publishing contracts (with Leeds Music and with M. Witmark &amp; Sons), the set reveals a much subtler and more fascinating journey than the popular shorthand myth of Dylan's shifting cleanly from folk apprentice to political firebrand to poetic rock'n'roller. For starters, a great many of the songs to which Dylan first affixed his name as writer were simply his own original lyrics atop traditional folk melodies. Not all of these words excoriated social injustice either-- far from it. Even from the beginning, there were love songs and outlaw songs, moodily poetic songs and broad jokes. Still, <i>The Witmark Demos</i> does demonstrate an evolution in songwriting genius, and one that took place in a frighteningly short period of a time by a young man who'd yet to turn 24 when the last of these recordings were made. On this set, you can hear Dylan moving past the bedrock melodies of folk and crafting indelible ones of his own (""Don't Think Twice, It's All Right""). You can hear him perfecting the protest song (""Blowin' in the Wind"", ""Masters of War""). And you can hear him falling in love with the music of words and beginning to invent a new vocabulary for pop music (a scratchy, nascent piano-only take of ""Mr. Tambourine Man"").</p>
<p>Only 15 of the set's 47 songs are unheard in <i>any</i> incarnation on a previous Dylan release (more on them later). The other 32 are split fairly evenly between germinal takes on songs from early-60s Dylan albums and alternate rough cuts of tunes that appear in equally embryonic states on the first Bootleg Series issue, 1991's <i>Volumes 1-3</i>. You might think auxiliary efforts would be of interest only to Dylan obsessives-- and in some cases these readings scarcelyÂ differ from others in his catalogue. Still, there are revelations: The oft-covered ""Tomorrow Is a Long Time"" has appeared previously only in live form on Dylan's second greatest hits compilation, and the version here is far richer, the guitar playing lovely and sublime. The classic protest song ""Oxford Town"" may be less immaculate here, but it's more bracing and insistent. The readings of ""Mama, You've Been on My Mind"" and ""I'll Keep It with Mine"" are especially pained and plaintive, while the bitingly satirical ""Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues"" and ""Rambling, Gambling Willie"" are looser and more ebullient here than anywhere else they've appeared before.</p>
<p>As for the 15 ""new"" songs, a few are mere fragments and a few others are fairly boilerplate, but again there are real treasures. ""Farewell"" haunts with its melody while ""The Death of Emmett Till"" haunts with its words, yet both are outshone by the bitterly ironic tour de force ""Long Ago, Far Away"", where Dylan enumerates social injustices ostensibly relegated to the distant past that were in fact still occuring in his own time, witheringly spitting the refrain, ""Those things don't happen no more nowadays."" ""I'd Hate to Be You on That Dreadful Day"" and ""All Over You"" further display comic sides, and then there's ""Long Time Gone"", which shows us an initial flowering of the unflappably cool mythical icon Dylan would fully become in the mid-60s. The song's refrain offers a perfect summation of how this set reveals the historical depth of Dylan's musical education as well as the lengths to which he would eclipse it. ""I'm a long time a-comin',"" Dylan sings, ""and I'll be a long time gone.""</p></div>"|14821.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14821-the-bootleg-series-vol-9-the-witmark-demos-1962-1964/|9.1|Joshua Love

I imagine you wouldn't pick the almost painfully sincere and Billboard-topping Arcade Fire, but you're not Caleb Followill. Despite <i>Only By the Night</i>'sÂ elevating Kings of Leon from self-imagined superstars to actual superstars, Followill has spent the leadup to the release of <i>Come Around Sundown </i>in attack mode, throwing ill subliminals at Richard Reed Parry (the dude with the helmet), preemptively turning down <i>Glee, </i>and calling their breakout hit ""Sex on Fire"" a ""piece of shit,"" the message being ""look at these effin' hipsters, we're the real deal."" Aw-shucks posturing aside, KoL have always been savvy about how they position themselves, and this is a classic political move: galvanizing a majority with a sense of victimhood.</p>
<p>But after hearing <i>Come Around Sundown</i>, here's the thing about this ""us vs. them"" tactic: I don't believe it, in large part because I don't think Kings of Leon do either. <i>Come Around Sundown </i>indeed feels like an awfully political work of art, though it's not necessary falling into the philosophy of red state/blue state. Rather, Kings of Leon themselves come off like jaded and wearied political lifers who've finally realized what it takes to win the game they're playing: That compromise is an end, that saying nothing at all is often saying the right thing.</p>
<p>Those sort of mixed messages permeate <i>Come Around Sundown. </i>The rise of Kings of Leon has coincided directly with their ability to be compared to U2, and just as you suspect they follow fame with a loose, modest comedown album pumped up to stadium status grandeur against its own will. At its core, first single ""Radioactive"" is a pleasingly aerodynamic piece of radio rock, a two-note bass riff giving an alley-oop to the most emphatic, hollering hook on <i>Sundown</i>. So why the gospel choir on the chorus? Well, that's just what the biggest of the big do, and the staggeringly exploitative video uncomfortably suggests the idea of it as soul-by-osmosis. Duly acknowledging the midnight tokers, ""Mary"" is full of headslap, ""Sweet Leaf""-deep metaphors. Meanwhile, ""Birthday"" is a barstool rabble-rouser on first glance, but it's little more than an exhibit for what's become the stock characterization of women on Kings of Leon songs, namely, the kind of mythical, hell-raising maneater who still manages to make her submissive victim sound misognystic. Fact is, even if Kings of Leon sound almost nothing like the guys who made <i>Youth &amp; Young Manhood</i>, they still have no trouble recognizing the archetypes that trigger an immense sense of self-satisfaction from people who insist rock achieved perfection in 1974.</p>
<p>At the very least, the powerfully encoded titles of ""Pickup Truck"", ""Beach Side"", ""Back Down South"", and ""Mi Amigo"" aren't a real indication of what they deliver-- though there's the occasional pedal steel and fiddle sigh, Kings of Leon stop shy of the ""we're a country band now"" pandering that prolonged the careers of Bon Jovi, Kid Rock, Jewel, and Darius Rucker. But even if they did overemphasize their Tennessee twang, these songs in particular call out <i>Come Around Sundown</i> for lacking the lowest common denominator of all pop: hooks. Even if this still packs amphitheatres, what are the crowds suppose to sing along to?Â At this point, you should no doubt be used to Followill's bizarre accent, which sounds wholly averse to enunciation, but tonally, he remains one of the most grating singers in rock. Regardless of what incarnation of KoL you're talking about, the vocals should have depth, warmth, or swagger, but Followill lacks grit, instead gilded with a squeaky, mewling edge that is unwisely amplified by featuring him punishingly high in the mix at all times.</p>
<p>A shame, really since KoL do have their charms-- the rhythm section is often agile, inventive, and propulsive when the tempo allows it, and like the similarly positioned Coldplay, there are hints of a wellspring of eccentricity that they haven't been able to fully tap into. But as in political debate, nuance is rarely acknowledged and incremental progress is often mistaken for none at all when it comes to bands at this level. You're either in or you're out, and for some reason people tend to think thatÂ being against Kings of Leon is akin to being against drinking whiskey or getting laid. That's not necessarily Kings of Leon's fault, but <i>Come Around Sundown </i>is, and it ends up being no different from a lot of the phony populism in the air these days.</p></div>"|14830.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14830-come-around-sundown/|3.6|Ian Cohen

It's hard to imagine that he's ever had what he considered to be a bad idea. On the one hand, this sublime self-confidence is sort of awe-inspiring, and exactly the sort of attitude we demand from our pop stars. On the other hand, Pharrell has had an awful lot of wretched ideas.</p>
<p>Ever since 2001, his rock-band side project N.E.R.D. has been a reliable repository for all of the worst ones. Back when he and Chad Hugo were still dominating hip-hop radio, N.E.R.D. albums served a useful purpose: they brought the super-producers, endearingly, to earth. For every indestructible ""What Happened to That Boy"" or ""Superthug"", there was an ""Everyone Nose"" or a ""She Wants to Move""-- something goofy and dubiously conceived where their reach wildly exceeded their grasp. N.E.R.D. albums may never have made for essential listening, but they spoke to an important part of the Neptunes storyline, fleshing out Hugo and Williams' image as likable, overly enthusiastic dorks.</p>
<p>So the fact that <i>Nothing</i>, their fourth album, is a parade of deliriously bad ideas-- terrible ones realized with fervent conviction, half-promising ones botched by disastrous execution-- shouldn't even really be held against it. That's sort of a N.E.R.D. album's reason for existing. The reason that listening to <i>Nothing</i> is so profoundly depressing, however, is because the first half of the above equation-- the part where the Neptunes are still cranking out lethal, indelible radio hits-- has more or less evaporated. Without that crucial ballast, both sides of the Neptunes story swing irretrievably into orbit. The worst moments on <i>Nothing</i>-- ""Life as a Fish"", for instance, which recycles the chord changes to <i>In Search of...</i>'s ""Bobby James"" and uses them to soundtrack Pharrell's preposterously dramatic retelling of God creating Earth; or the Jethro Tull smooth-jazz beat switchup of ""I've Seen the Light / (Interlude) Inside of Clouds""-- are the sounds of an artistic compass spinning wildly.</p>
<p>True to form, Pharrell never sounds in the least discouraged steering his way through this wreckage. Whether he's assaying a timid version of Jim Morrison on ""Help Me"" or pillow-talk whispering his way through the mortifyingly stupid, Daft Punk-produced ""Hypnotize U"", he remains utterly convinced of his capabilities as a frontman. The songs that <i>do</i> work-- the double-time clavinet-and-bongos funk workout of ""Party People"", or the tense, minimal thump of the Deluxe Edition's ""Sacred Temple"" and ""Nothing on You""-- hark back to what Neptunes tracks sounded like in 2004, when Pharrell and Chad still had a firm grasp on the rewards of tension and empty space. There isn't a lot left on <i>Nothing</i>, apart from these faint reminders, to indicate that these two guys were the same pair who once revolutionized the sound of hip-hop.</p></div>"|14825.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14825-nothing/|4.1|Jayson Greene

Like most strains of electronic dance music, dubstep was created and cultivated by adventurous DJs and partygoers. Eventually those new electronic sounds tend to become one of two things: a battleground for arguments about purity and definitions, which inevitably stunts growth and inherently creates dead ends; or a once hands-on, dangerous, and visceral sound that intellectualizes itself into something considerably more dull when removed from its utilitarian dancefloor origins.</p>
<p>A funny thing happened to dubstep, however: So far it's avoided each of these traps, proving itself voracious and adaptable, and just as exciting as headphone music as it is room-shaking club music. It's also become an international force, one of the most universally agreed upon leftfield musics of our time, penetrating the fanbases and sounds of everything from hip-hop to house to indie to the avant-garde. In many ways it's a true reflection of globalism, and arguably a product of this century's downcast global mood. Dark, urban, and paranoid, dubstep is an appropriate soundtrack to an era in which the West is dominated by economic fallout, global warming, terrorism, and its encroaching marginalization.</p>
<p>There isn't another city in the world other than London that could have birthed dubstep, but the sound quickly became a global concern. Crafted in the UK by a young group of producers uninterested in jealously guarding their scene, it quickly spread-- not just as club nights, pirate radio, and white labels but through SoundClouds, message boards, and online mixes as well. It's now a central force in underground culture from Moscow to Los Angeles to Buenos Aires, and with the Internet as its key delivery device, all of these scenes and their players are having an ongoing dialogue with one another, making dubstep a versatile jumping-off point for any number of ideas. It's more of a means than an end, and in that sense it has mutated in unexpected and dynamic ways.</p>
<p>As with other global rhythmic sounds, Diplo now attempts to sift through these rapidly changing sands and make sense of it all on his new mix, <i>Blow Your Head Volume 1</i>. It's an almost impossible task, trying to make sense of something that is changing so quickly. Diplo seems to grasp this, and aims to present the breadth and depth of dubstep as filtered through his own sensibilities, with a heavy emphasis on its booming, large dancefloor-friendly permeations and its encroachment into more pop realms. (He illustrated the latter mostly through his own collaborations or those of his friends.)</p>
<p>Where other effective or on-paper promising dubstep compilations-- <i>5: Five Years of Hyperdub</i>; Peverelist's forthcoming mix of the Bristol purple sound-- have given themselves a clear umbrella under which they work, Diplo, perhaps fittingly for those familiar with his work, goes all-in on eclecticism. The brave gambit means this was always going to be an incomplete picture. And while his instincts are sound, it's difficult to articulate the full spectrum of a rapidly mutating scene. In that sense, the comp is reminiscent of Soul Jazz's <i>Dynamite</i> sets, which laid to waste the notion that ""all reggae music sounds the same"" by expertly placing songs from throughout Jamaica's rich history-- whether ska, rocksteady, reggae, toasting, dub, roots, lovers rock, or dancehell-- side by side. Those eye-opening collections had 40 years of music to pull from, however; Diplo has about 40 months.</p>
<p>And whether it's a case of licensing limitations or just selection, Diplo's mix never really coalesces around an idea other than ""dubstep is an important sound right now."" Part of the problem is that it's self-promotional: The mix is weakest when Diplo's own circle is involved. Rusko is basically the Audio Bullys or Oxide &amp; Neutrino of this shit, and Borgore isn't much better; subtlety isn't in their arsenal, with each treating dubstep like a bludgeon. Diplo himself collaborates here with Lil Jon, so you know there aren't a lot of shades of gray to that track. (Dubstep as the new big beat can work, granted, as DZ's ""Down"" here indicates.)</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Jessica Mauboy and Little Jinder carry tantalizing glimpses of what the sound could do if Rihanna went all in on it, or if UK funky dirtied itself up a bit, but neither track really hits as hard as it should. The highlights here are the artists most people already know-- Benga, Zomby, Joker &amp; Ginz, and James Blake, none of them at their best. The missteps here sound odd, not just in their sequencing but because of the variation in quality; Rusko's fratboy-baiting next to James Blake's exploratory remix of Untold in particular is a big jump. In the end then, for all of Diplo's good intentions and curatorial muscle, the first volume ofÂ <i>Blow Your Head</i> struggles not just as a lesson, or a sampler, but also simply as a collection of songs you want to listen to.</p></div>"|14831.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14831-blow-your-head-volume-1-diplo-presents-dubstep/|6.5|Scott Plagenhoef

Higgs' work centers on dramatic speech, a kind of transcendental sermon-poetry that repeats words and phrases until they break free from literal meanings. Harper does the same with sound, both solo and with Nautical Almanac, his longtime duo with Carly Ptak. Mining busted tape loops, non-linear circuitry, and other homemade sonic tools, Harper juggles noises so that they, as he <a href=""http://vimeo.com/14216700'"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">puts it</a>, ""[interact] with your consciousness"" to produce magical effects.</p>
<p>On their first record together, <i>Clairaudience Fellowship</i>, it sounds like Harper and Higgs have interacted for a long time, maybe forever. Higgs' recent sprawling 2xCDÂ <i><a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14256-say-god/"">Say God</a></i> had a timeless feeling too. But its sonic background wasn't always rich enough to match his verbal virtuosity. Rather than rising to meet his commanding voice, the music sometimes retreated from it. By contrast, Harper's sounds stand up to Higgs' proclamations, bouncing off of them, wrapping around them, at times boldly battling them.</p>
<p>The closest reference point to <i>Clairaudience Fellowship </i>is David Tudor and John Cage's <i>Indeterminacy</i>. On that 1959 album, Cage told stories while Tudor created abstract noise in a separate room, finding magic in the random intersections between words and sound. Though just as open to sonic serendipity, Harper and Higgs are more locked-in than Tudor and Cage. Clunking half-beats and static squiggles ride the rhythm of three-word phrases. ""You are the life span of time forms and the life form of time spans, yes the time form of life space,"" Higgs intones as Harper's metallic clangs leapfrog in response. Those familiar with Harper's music might be surprised at the lack of anything harsh or confrontational. But his sounds are so busy that they're impossible to ignore. Even on his sparest tracks, thin wisps of noise eventually coat Higgs' repetitive descriptions.</p>
<p>In fact, you could say that this is more Harper's record than Higgs'-- his sounds are so consistently interesting they can make Higgs' more formal style feel monotone. That argument is bolstered by the album's final track, a 12-minute noise jam that is almost Higgs-less. But listen closely and you can hear Higgs' cadences filling the sound like a ghost animating a bedsheet. That's the strongest impression left by <i>Clairaudience Fellowship</i>-- you may be able to pick out when Higgs is speaking and Harper is blasting, but it's impossible to separate their individual ideas from the synchronicity of their musical mind-meld.</p></div>"|14827.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14827-clairaudience-fellowship/|7.1|Marc Masters

As phrases like ""signed and numbered,"" ""copper plate,"" and ""lithographic"" gave way to descriptors like ""birch paper-covered slipcase,"" ""crimson stock,"" and ""foil blocked credit sheet,"" my first thought was whether the relentless fetishization of the physical product does the content within any favors.</span></p>
<p><span>My second thought was, of <i>course</i> it's going to be lavish. This is, after all, Brian Eno and Warp, two institutions of electronic music, braininess, and design, coming together for their first-ever co-release. The union is so forehead-slappingly perfect that one wonders how the two have managed to co-exist </span><span>independently </span><span>for so long. </span><span>But if lavish is the language here, it's for more than celebratory reasons. Constructed partly out of rejects from Eno's soundtrack work for Peter Jackson's </span><i>The Lovely Bones</i><span> and partly from original studio sessions held in 2009 and 2010, </span><i>Small Craft on a Milk Sea</i><span> is being pitched as a loose homage to the very concept of soundtrack music.</span></p>
<p><span>This concept is not a new one, not even for Eno, whose 1978 album </span><i>Music for Films </i><span>and its 1983 sequel were borne from identical insight. If not for the sheer amount of time that's passed, or his new collaborators-- electronic music composer Jon Hopkins and guitarist Leo Abrahams-- he might easily have christened this </span><i>Music for Films 4</i><span>. And the truth is that, although much has been made of the trio's working process and how it relied equally on improvization and computer editing, </span><i>Small Craft on a Milk Sea</i><span> sits surprisingly comfortably alongside the records from Eno's ambient and experimental golden era. Others might argue that fit is a little too comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span>With few exceptions, </span><i>Small Craft on a Milk Sea</i><span>'s</span><span> 15 songs fall roughly into one of two categories: 'ambient' and 'active.' The
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
former contains some predictably transcendent moments, such as the gently climbing opener ""Emerald and Lime"" and its later-appearing sister ""Emerald and Stone"", both of which conjure up the sort of </span><span>meandering, piano-led beauty that Angelo Badalamenti specializes in. Elsewhere, another twin set, ""Complex Heaven"" and ""Lesser Heaven"", offer barely moving soundscapes that are respectively foreboding and serene, and ""Calcium Needles"" invokes an ambient frost that's as chilly as Biosphere's most glacial work.</span></p>
<p><span>The 'active' category yields mixed results, occasionally sounding overindulged or dated. ""Horse"" is a hyperactive mix of mewling guitars and shuddering snares, while ""Paleosonic"" and ""Dust Shuffle"" go down as aimless proto-industrial electronica. ""2 Forms of Anger"" fares far better, sounding like a fractured triangulation of Skinny Puppy, Joy Division, and Tin Machine (that's a good thing, right?), while ""Bone Jump""'s dorky arpeggios and haunted house synths mostly just manage to charm. </span></p>
<p><span>As </span><i>Small Craft on a Milk Sea</i><span> oscillates between these familiar poles of serenity and disarray, it becomes evident that the Warp connection isn't indicative of any drastic modernization of Eno's sound. And yet, in an interview with Pitchfork earlier this week, Eno spoke about how some of these tracks began with conceptual briefs in which he instructed his collaborators to replicate popular music from the near future. If that's the case, perhaps Eno's version of the future isn't forged by sonic innovation but rather by recombinence and fashion's unpredictable finger. Given enough time, the fresh will be re-born as stale, the wonky will become cool, the clichÃ©Â will become transcendent, and the freak will become a salaryman. When taken as little slivers of a larger poem, </span><i>Small Craft on a Milk Sea</i><span>'s</span><span> song titles present the listener with a notion of the past, present, and future existing as one holistic entity. With Brian Eno, you have a man who sounds uncompromisingly like all three.</span></p></div>"|14828.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14828-small-craft-on-a-milk-sea/|7.4|Mark Pytlik

Any excuse will do, really. The albums Wyatt has intermittently released over the past 40 years are glacially paced and occasionally maddening, but they're also fascinating, thoughtful, and spectacularly beautiful at times. He's also got one of the great singing voices in Anglophone pop, as high, lonesome, and weathered as the cliffs of Dover, whether he's crooning the politicized lyrics he favors or being a scat-singing ""human horn.""</p>
<p>1974's <i>Rock Bottom</i> wasn't Wyatt's first solo album-- that was 1970's long-out-of-print <i>The End of an Ear</i>-- but it was the first record of the second act of his career: In 1973, the wildly energetic former drummer of Soft Machine (and leader of Matching Mole) broke his spine in an accident. He spent eight months in the hospital, reinventing himself as a singer/keyboardist and reworking some pieces he'd already composed for what would have been his new band.</p>
<p>The six songs of <i>Rock Bottom</i> were a new kind of music for Wyatt: very slow, exquisitely deliberate. (It's easy to hear echoes of the album in latter-day Radiohead, among others.) The magnificent ""Sea Song"" is the most immediately gripping piece here, but everything has peculiar little joys that take their time emerging. ""Alifib"" is an aphasic love song to his partner Alfreda Benge (they were married the day the album was released); ""Alife"" brings her in to offer an affectionate rebuke. And Wyatt effectively ducks out of his own album a few minutes before it ends: ""Little Red Robin Hood Hit the Road"" concludes with a peculiar three-minute recitative by Ivor Cutler.</p>
<p>That kind of abdication of the spotlight carried over to <i>Rock Bottom</i>'s 1975 sequel,Â <i>Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard</i>, almost entirely music composed by other people (with occasional lyrics by Wyatt)-- it includes pieces by expatriate South African trumpeter Mongezi Feza (""Sonia"", on which Feza himself plays), Charlie Haden, and Jacques Offenbach. The eight-and-a-half-minute ""Team Spirit"" is sung from the point of view of a soccer ball; ""Soup Song"" is a rewritten version of the jolly stroll ""Slow Walkin' Talk"", from the repertoire of Wyatt's mid-60s band the Wilde Flowers, now featuring very silly lyrics from the point of view of a ham hock.</p>
<p>Wyatt kept a fairly low profile over the next five years or so: He sang on a handful of Michael Mantler's projects and played a little on Brian Eno's <i>Before and After Science</i> and <i>Music for Airports</i>, but that was about it. (""I am a real minimalist, because I don't do very much,"" he once noted.) So the material that ended up on 1982's <i>Nothing Can Stop Us</i> was a surprise. Most of the album collects a series of four brilliant cover singles Wyatt recorded in quick succession in early 1980. He turns Chic's ""At Last I Am Free"" into a prayerful drone, the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet's ""Stalin Wasn't Stallin'"" into a woozy <i>a cappella</i> reappraisal of wartime communism, and Ivor Cutler's ""Grass"" into a comment on ideology (played with a Bengali group called Dishari who got the B-side to themselves). There's also a heartfelt version of the socialist standard ""Red Flag"", and one original, ""Born Again Cretin"".</p>
<p>A venomously sarcastic, bluntly political song, it pointed the way toward 1985's <i>Old Rottenhat</i>, which genuinely is a solo record--Benge appears for four seconds, and other than that it's wall-to-wall Wyatt. The opening ""Alliance"" is an attack on politicians who sell out the Left (""You say you're self-sufficient/ But you don't dig your own coal""); ""The United States of Amnesia"" concerns the ""Aryan empire"" forgetting its massacre of natives. There's some nifty songwriting here--""The Age of Self"" is one of Wyatt's most winning melodies--but the album's on-the-fly production and chintzy keyboard presets make the album sound like a preliminary demo rather than something meant to be listened to.</p>
<p>That problem is redoubled with <i>Dondestan</i>-- whose title means, essentially, ""nowhere,"" as in ""Â¿dÃ³nde estÃ¡?"" It was first released in 1991, then remixed and resequenced in 1998 as <i>Dondestan (Revisited)</i>, the version included in the new reissues. Apparently the record that inspired the practice of ""Wyatting"" (going to one of those pub Internet jukeboxes that has a million available tracks and playing something that totally kills the mood), it's a bit livelier than <i>Old Rottenhat</i>, sometimes not in a good way: The title track grinds a nagging piano melody into the dirt for five minutes, and ""Shrinkrap"" is, yes, a rap about going to therapy. Wyatt's voice continued to get richer and craggier with age; as he joked in the liner notes of <i>Nothing Can Stop Us</i>, ""a hesitant beat there, a dodgy note there... are of course entirely deliberate and reproduced as evidence of my almost painful sincerity."" But not many people would have guessed from <i>Dondestan</i> that a lot of Wyatt's best music was still ahead of him.</p></div>"|14797.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14797-rock-bottom-ruth-is-stranger-than-richard-nothing-can-stop-us-old-rottenhat-dondestan-revisited/|9.0|Douglas Wolk

<p>1974's <i>Rock Bottom</i> wasn't Wyatt's first solo album-- that was 1970's long-out-of-print <i>The End of an Ear</i>-- but it was the first record of the second act of his career: In 1973, the wildly energetic former drummer of Soft Machine (and leader of Matching Mole) broke his spine in an accident. He spent eight months in the hospital, reinventing himself as a singer/keyboardist and reworking some pieces he'd already composed for what would have been his new band.</p>
<p>The six songs of <i>Rock Bottom</i> were a new kind of music for Wyatt: very slow, exquisitely deliberate. (It's easy to hear echoes of the album in latter-day Radiohead, among others.) The magnificent ""Sea Song"" is the most immediately gripping piece here, but everything has peculiar little joys that take their time emerging. ""Alifib"" is an aphasic love song to his partner Alfreda Benge (they were married the day the album was released); ""Alife"" brings her in to offer an affectionate rebuke. And Wyatt effectively ducks out of his own album a few minutes before it ends: ""Little Red Robin Hood Hit the Road"" concludes with a peculiar three-minute recitative by Ivor Cutler.</p>
<p>That kind of abdication of the spotlight carried over to <i>Rock Bottom</i>'s 1975 sequel,Â <i>Ruth Is Stranger Than Richard</i>, almost entirely music composed by other people (with occasional lyrics by Wyatt)-- it includes pieces by expatriate South African trumpeter Mongezi Feza (""Sonia"", on which Feza himself plays), Charlie Haden, and Jacques Offenbach. The eight-and-a-half-minute ""Team Spirit"" is sung from the point of view of a soccer ball; ""Soup Song"" is a rewritten version of the jolly stroll ""Slow Walkin' Talk"", from the repertoire of Wyatt's mid-60s band the Wilde Flowers, now featuring very silly lyrics from the point of view of a ham hock.</p>
<p>Wyatt kept a fairly low profile over the next five years or so: He sang on a handful of Michael Mantler's projects and played a little on Brian Eno's <i>Before and After Science</i> and <i>Music for Airports</i>, but that was about it. (""I am a real minimalist, because I don't do very much,"" he once noted.) So the material that ended up on 1982's <i>Nothing Can Stop Us</i> was a surprise. Most of the album collects a series of four brilliant cover singles Wyatt recorded in quick succession in early 1980. He turns Chic's ""At Last I Am Free"" into a prayerful drone, the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet's ""Stalin Wasn't Stallin'"" into a woozy <i>a cappella</i> reappraisal of wartime communism, and Ivor Cutler's ""Grass"" into a comment on ideology (played with a Bengali group called Dishari who got the B-side to themselves). There's also a heartfelt version of the socialist standard ""Red Flag"", and one original, ""Born Again Cretin"".</p>
<p>A venomously sarcastic, bluntly political song, it pointed the way toward 1985's <i>Old Rottenhat</i>, which genuinely is a solo record--Benge appears for four seconds, and other than that it's wall-to-wall Wyatt. The opening ""Alliance"" is an attack on politicians who sell out the Left (""You say you're self-sufficient/ But you don't dig your own coal""); ""The United States of Amnesia"" concerns the ""Aryan empire"" forgetting its massacre of natives. There's some nifty songwriting here--""The Age of Self"" is one of Wyatt's most winning melodies--but the album's on-the-fly production and chintzy keyboard presets make the album sound like a preliminary demo rather than something meant to be listened to.</p>
<p>That problem is redoubled with <i>Dondestan</i>-- whose title means, essentially, ""nowhere,"" as in ""Â¿dÃ³nde estÃ¡?"" It was first released in 1991, then remixed and resequenced in 1998 as <i>Dondestan (Revisited)</i>, the version included in the new reissues. Apparently the record that inspired the practice of ""Wyatting"" (going to one of those pub Internet jukeboxes that has a million available tracks and playing something that totally kills the mood), it's a bit livelier than <i>Old Rottenhat</i>, sometimes not in a good way: The title track grinds a nagging piano melody into the dirt for five minutes, and ""Shrinkrap"" is, yes, a rap about going to therapy. Wyatt's voice continued to get richer and craggier with age; as he joked in the liner notes of <i>Nothing Can Stop Us</i>, ""a hesitant beat there, a dodgy note there... are of course entirely deliberate and reproduced as evidence of my almost painful sincerity."" But not many people would have guessed from <i>Dondestan</i> that a lot of Wyatt's best music was still ahead of him.</p></div>"|14797.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14797-rock-bottom-ruth-is-stranger-than-richard-nothing-can-stop-us-old-rottenhat-dondestan-revisited/|4.8|Douglas Wolk

And for all the revelatory material on DÃ¢m-Funk's watershed 2009 releases, his idiosyncratic take on vintage electro-funk had to come from somewhere. The <i>Toeachizown </i>series came across not just like a breakthrough, but a long-brewing culmination of a deep but largely backgrounded career. And the dude was old enough to come up in the roller-boogie era his current music pinpoints so distinctly-- can somebody's style really be retro if it's always been a part of him?</p>
<p><i>Adolescent Funk </i>sheds a bit of light on DÃ¢m-Funk's underheard formative years, focusing on a series of demos and hometapes he made between 1988 and 1992. That period was a heady one for funk and R&amp;B-- Michael Jackson and Prince running top-speed victory laps; Teddy Riley lighting new jack swing's fuse; g-funk reintroducing bounce to the airwaves-- and the songs on this comp reveal an enthusiastic kid with a Casio SK-1 trying to figure out what he could learn from it all. How you hear this music really depends on whether you like late-80s R&amp;B enough to hear a promising amateur's take on it: ""Sexy Lady"", ""Raindrops"", and ""Attitude"" in particular have a certain Class of '89 vibe to them, though the best cut here, the hypnotic ""When I'm With U I Think of Her"", has all the qualities of a long-lost lo-fi house classic.</p>
<p>Not that his curriculum was limited to then-contemporary sounds. The ""Freak of the Week""-paraphrasing melody of ""I Like Your Big Azz (Girl)"" is the album's second-most obvious nod to late-70s Funkadelic (the collection's title being the first). And while it sounds like <i>Sign 'O' the Times </i>made an influential impression on DÃ¢m-Funk, so did <i>Dirty Mind</i>: check the punchy new wave throb of ""It's My Life!"" A lot of the characteristics that manifested more strongly in <i>Toeachizown</i> were already in their prototype phase here, especially DÃ¢m's ambidextrous, two-keyboard rhythmic counterpoints and his tendency to ride out grooves until their tight-knit structure makes it feel like they're sprawling comfortably.</p>
<p>Then there's another side of DÃ¢m-Funk that <i>didn't</i> really manifest on <i>Toeachizown--</i> his slickly jovial voice that raggedly combines R&amp;B lover-man smoothness with a sort of halfway-squeaky funk archness. And while young Damon Riddick didn't quite have the vocal chops of, say, Al B. Sure!, his personality drives these songs enough to compensate for it. ""It's My Life!"", ""UCanDoItIfUWant2"", and ""I Love Life"" all ride on affirmations of proudly doing your own thing; the latter song even ends on a message against suicide. The love songs are a bit more angst-ridden-- the self-explanatory ""Sexy Lady"" notwithstanding, most of them focus on disillusioned breakups (""Do You Feel Like I Feel?""), emotional clashes (""Attitude""), and restless dissatisfaction (""When I'm With U I Think of Her""). And then there's ""The Telephone Call"", where our protagonist is bothered by constant telephone calls (""It must be a bitch"") when he's trying to work on his music. That it comes across as charismatic rather than self-absorbed attests to how much fun Riddick must've been having putting all this together.</p>
<p>Even so, the rawness of <i>Adolescent Funk </i>fits better as a point of origin for all the great stuffÂ DÃ¢m-FunkÂ does now than as an actual complement to it. Stones Throw majordomo Peanut Butter Wolf picked out the tracks for this, and his judgment's trustworthy enough that I'm convinced this was the best stuff he could excavate. But even the choicest early demo tapes still sound like early demo tapes, and if the tape hiss on this doesn't distract you, the occasional tripped-over beats and undercooked lyrics will. (If you ever want to hear how <i>not</i> to overreach on a drum solo, ""The Telephone Call"" is Exhibit A.) There's plenty here for rare-groove enthusiasts with an 80s fixation and <i>Toeachizown </i>converts interested in a bit of backstory. But knowing where he's taken these sounds since then? It just makes you want to hear that funk all grown up.</p></div>"|14823.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14823-adolescent-funk/|6.7|Nate Patrin

Skodvin, a.k.a. Svarte Greiner (Hint: it's drones). Skodvin has an authoritative way of transforming jet-black bass and chattering textures into dark and distinctive atmospheres. All of his usual tricks were in place on his last record, <i>Kappe</i>, but it felt unusually staid and monochromatic. Both deficiencies are rectified on the latest Svarte Greiner release, <i>Penpals Forever (and Ever)</i>, which isn't even a proper new album. The two long opening tracks were first issued as a limited-edition cassette in 2008, and here, they're re-mastered for CD alongside three brand new, shorter tracks.</p>
<p>The Digitalis label boldly asserts that <i>Penpals</i> tells ""the imaginary tale of a long-dead Baroque painter and his telekinetic correspondence with a flightless bird,"" although there is zero perceptible evidence of this in the music. Silliness of the meta-story aside, the music itself is sumptuously dreary. Throughout, violin bows and analog filters transform electric guitar tones into gruesome pricks and smears. The first two tracks (all of them are untitled) establish the field of play: One, a jittery fugue for brittle guitar swirls and guttural bass, borders on aggressive; the other, an airy two-tone drone with bowed shrieks and lonesome clangs, more readily slips into the background. More than telekinetic communication (wouldn't that be ""telepathic"" anyway?), the tracks evoke bleakly pleasurable anxiety.</p>
<p>The highly contrasting timbres of the two openers already break up the monotony that bogged down <i>Kappe</i>, and the new compositions further expand the palette while complementing the reissued material perfectly. In one, gong-like tones accumulate resonance until the whole mass lifts off with the grandeur of a Bach organ chord. In another, delicately stretched and twisted metallic tones  gradually inflate with breath. And then a third track is built around a widening cone of  gale-force distortion.  The slow and tortuous crescendos that Skodvin favors are always satisfying when he takes care to differentiate them from one another, as he does here. The eerie tension doesn't break; it multiplies, as the sonic light goes dim and weird.</p></div>"|14789.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14789-penpals-forever-and-ever/|7.4|Brian Howe

Ghostland Observatory had been knocking around Austin for a few years prior to <i>Robotique Majestique</i>, but it was their first album to come out after MGMT blew up. Granted, what ensued was a label feeding frenzy only by 2008's standards, but it was a pretty opportune time to be in a duo whose main talking points were squealing synths, hair-metal falsettos, and a wardrobe that included capes. In light of MGMT's rough 2010, you might figure that if Ghostland Observatory hadn't made good on their ""next big thing"" talk already, it sure wasn't gonna happen now. Of course, it doesn't hurt that kind of armchair quarterbacking that <i>Codename: Rondo</i> is pretty much the same terrible album they've made three times already, only with fewer industry rubberneckers to cheer it on.</p>
<p>Ghostland Observatory are sometimes said to be ""simple"" or ""fun"" and thus necessary in the overly stuffy world of indie rock. This overlooks that most of the other acts that Ghostland immediately conjure (Daft Punk, Hot Chip, Scissor Sisters, even George Michael balladry on ""Mama"") have already proven more than capable of mainstream consumption without a first-gen ringtone version of itself existing. The problem isn't that Ghostland Observatory seem like unserious people, it's that the same flippant attitude infects their musicianship. <i>Codename: Rondo</i> sounds like two people doing the least amount of work possible before something can be considered a ""song."" If you're the type who enjoys watching 35 straight minutes of College Humor clips, <i>Codename: Rondo</i> might be up your alley. Everyone else will just hear 10 songs that fail as both pop and humor.</p>
<p>Unlikely to be heard in any hockey arena, a tinny rendering of the ""Rock'N'Roll Part 2"" beat pops up on ""Glitter"" (get it?) and is overtaken by Aaron Behrens' parody roadhouse blues wail filtered through a malfunctioning modem. If you can't get enough Speak &amp; Spell vocal effects, ""That's Right"" and ""Body Shop"" (which is not about cars!) are there for you. If you're awfully generous, you can view ""Give Me the Beat"" as a straight-faced anti-drug/materialism, pro-""the beat"" PSA, but did it have to be delivered in a ""jive-turkey"" cadence? And if you're someone who heard ""Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell"" and fucking <i>hated it</i>, then I feel like you did after experiencing this album's title track-- which didn't deserve the multiple listens it took to figure out the joke. That's just the first half. If you make it to the end, you're rewarded with a return to blog house (""Kick Clap Speaker"") where the squatters haven't taken out the trash in a decade.</p>
<p>Look, I understand it's a party even if I don't want to crash it, and if someone gets drunk or laid to <i>Codename: Rondo</i>, Ghostland Observatory's job is done. And if you willfully misread Insane Clown Posse's 2010 close-up, you can assume the lesson is that keeping the faith in the face of critical beatdowns will ultimately be rewarded. But Ghostland Observatory aren't functioning in opposition to anything. In lieu of actual hits, the mere belief in the mock-populism of this stuff has led to mainstream opportunities at big-time festivals and late night TV where they proved way out of their depth. Ghostland Observatory can't leave this crap alone, and the game doesn't need them.</p></div>"|14786.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14786-codename-rondo/|1.5|Ian Cohen

To say nothing of playing it live in its entirety. It's hard to think of a more fiercely beloved record a band has gone to great lengths to write out of its history. To recap: Weezer's self-titled<i> </i>Blue Album went multiplatinum on the strength of shiny power-pop and goofy videos anachronistic in the era of post-grunge.Â For the follow-up, Rivers Cuomo holed up at Harvard and made a disturbingly graphic, harshly recorded concept album that includesÂ his sniffing the fanmail of an 18-year old Japanese girl whileÂ imagining her masturbating. Needless to say, it was not played for laughs. <i>Pinkerton </i>was poorly received by critics upon release and considered a flop after peaking at #19. Cuomo probably didn't care about the critics, but he took the public indifference<i> </i>very<i> </i>personally, soon retreating from view. But the cult that adored and passionately identified with <i>Pinkerton </i>became hard to ignore by the turn of the century, with the commercial breakthrough of confessional emo seen as its ultimate vindication. The record that killed Weezer's career ended up saving it.</p>
<p>It's a nice story, and one that's integral and damn near necessary to protect <i>Pinkerton</i>'s legend: a popular misconception is that aÂ <i>Rolling Stone</i> readers' poll named it the worst album of 1996 (it was actually third behind Bush and DJ Spooky), and as Rob Mitchum suggested in his review of <i>Make Believe</i>, it's something that people of a certain age might protect from re-evaluation for what it might say about their youth. In actuality, <i>Pinkerton </i>may initially have been the victim of a generation gap. It was hardly the first album to get this uncomfortably confessional, but it had some unusually bad timing. Self-laceration <i>was </i>in vogue during 1996, but as far as critical favorites went, it was often from a female perspective (Liz Phair, PJ Harvey, Courtney Love) that balanced boldness and raw vulnerability. In comparison, <i>Pinkerton </i>was hardly misunderstood, but instead seen for what it was: written from a juvenile, male, and incredibly needy perspective. It's a really tough album to go to bat for if you're an adult, particularly since enjoying it is so closely associated with <i>relating</i> to it.</p>
<p>And who would want to do that? On the very first song, Cuomo is <i>Portnoy's Complaint </i>on wax, disappointed with his inability to find true love in the midst of meaningless sex. And on the last one, he forsakes a chance at true love for... you guessed it, meaningless sex, giving an explanation that drips with insincerity: ""I did what my body told me to/ I didn't mean to do you harm."" In between, he lashes out at a woman for having the nerve to be a lesbian (""Pink Triangle"") and for not devoting all of her attention to him (""No Other One""). He takes two failed relationships as concrete proof of romantic futility in ""Why Bother?"", and of course, the big reveal in ""Across the Sea"": ""It's all your fault, mama.""</p>
<p>And yetÂ because of all of this emotional baggage, the cathartic power of <i>Pinkerton</i> is second to none. While it's often compared to the Blue Album, <i>Pinkerton </i>bears more similarity to <i>In Utero</i>, a record that also mixed relatively raw alt-rock production, undeniable pop smarts, and a lead singer absolutely freaked the fuck out by fame. But while many sickeningly thought Kurt Cobain's suicide somehow validated his art, Cuomo's self-destruction was more quotidian and relatable, struggling with an unbearable need to be loved but a complete inability to realize the need for it to be reciprocated. It's why <i>Pinkerton </i>isn't misogynistic so much as confused: ""No Other One"" classically mistakes hating yourself for loving someone else, and ""El Scorcho"" reminds that fictional RomCom behavior is actually borderline sociopathic in real life. In fact, the songs most likened to cuddly Blue AlbumÂ Weezer are the darkest-- ""The Good Life"" is Cuomo at the endÂ of his rope, hysterical at the ridiculousness of his self-loathing,Â while a single line in ""El Scorcho"" sums up the core of <i>Pinkerton</i>'sÂ pain: ""I can't talk about it/ I gotta sing about it and make a record.""</p>
<p>The influence of <i>Pinkerton</i> led to hundreds of mostly regrettable bands, but what ultimately distinguishes Weezer is how they sonically mirror the unhinged and private mental terror of its narrator. Weezer actually sound <i>dangerous </i>here in places, in part due to the recording of Dave Fridmann, who maintains a first-take intimacy even when every instrument competes to be the loudest thing in the mix. Weezer's rhythm section rarely gets much credit, but Matt Sharp and Pat Wilson maintain a savage low-end they'd never repeat-- the coda of ""Tired of Sex"" embodies overwhelming and impotent frustration, while the chorus of ""Getchoo"" isn't a hook, it's a fist repeatedly hitting a wall.</p>
<p>The supposedly juvenile feelings of <i>Pinkerton </i>still pack visceral power years after listeners would've supposedly outgrown them. It's a record that reaches well beyond a diaristic look at Cuomo's perversions, and instead asks something more universal: Do we really grow out of our teenage feelings, or do we need something like <i>Pinkerton </i>to expose them as merely being repressed to the point where they mutate? It's heavy stuff, and in the manner of <i>Violent Femmes</i>, you can argue about the sexual politics, the late-career parody, or the total uncoolness of it in retrospect, but even if <i>Pinkerton </i>is ultimately an album that gets one single shot at you, the mark it leaves is indelible.</p>
<p>Befitting a band for the diehards, Weezer's always had certain B-sides that are every bit as loved as the singles. Though this deluxe version contains 25 extra tracks, 16 are alternate versions of material that appeared on <i>Pinkerton</i>: If you need muddy-sounding live versions of ""Why Bother?"" and ""Pink Triangle"", or if ""Across the Sea Piano Noodles"" triggers an uncontrollable completist impulse, consider it an early Christmas. Me, I'm here for their acoustic performances of ""El Scorcho"" and ""The Good Life"" at Y100, the erstwhile alt-rock station I listened to in high school. Otherwise, most of the unreleased B-sides are demo-level in both sound and quality.</p>
<p>The more intriguing prospect is <i>Death to False Metal</i>, proudly touted as ""Weezer's third release of the fourth quarter."" Not really sticking to any concrete organizational principle, Weezer cull unreleased material dating back to the late 90s from a wide range of sources, including their own fans and Toni Braxton. But as a clearinghouse for an increasingly prolific band, <i>False Metal </i>isn't particularly generous. In fact, judging from its wacky title/cover combo, 10-song tracklist, and overall quality, it dubiously achieves Cuomo's stated goal of creating the logical follow-up to <i>Hurley.</i></p>
<p>The power pop Weezer work with maintains its devotees in large part because of its adherence to a kind of strict formula, and having mastered it early in his career, Cuomo can churn it out effortlessly, for better or (mostly) worse. Verses are treated with merely custodial concern before the big hooks, there's the guitar solos that are flashy enough to be noticed but easy enough to learn, and the production glosses everything up to radio-ready ubiquity and anonymity. But once again, there's a laziness that's more annoying than any of Cuomo's ""cool dad"" humor. There's the song about turning up the radio, and it's called ""Turning Up the Radio""-- the irony of its being the result of a YouTube contest is actually kinda fascinating. Cuomo's shown an almost frightening ability to tap into a certain generic teenage frustration, and ""Losing My Mind"" is the song to which you can grouse about your allowance.</p>
<p>Upon reviewing <i>Hurley</i>, I said that Weezer's songs feel more like single-packed sitcoms now, but nothing on that album can match ""The Odd Couple"", which boasts the sort of hack-joke opening line (""I got a PC, you got a Mac"") that Fountains of Wayne wouldn't touch<i>.</i> ""Blowin' My Stack"" and ""I'm a Robot"" are the working-for-the-weekend anthems, and that both have blatantly similar lyrics (""I need cash to pay my bills"" / ""I have to earn money to pay my bills"") suggests a general lack of curatorial oversight to <i>False Metal.</i></p>
<p>At the very least, there's a sense of closure in the simultaneous release of <i>Pinkerton </i>and <i>Death to False Metal</i>: For the past decade, new Weezer albums have been unfavorably judged relative to <i>Pinkerton</i>, and hey, we finally get to do it in real time. But there's always been an underlying unease that, at least in more indie-leaning circles, we're becoming every bit as susceptible to the generation gap that led to the dismissal of <i>Pinkerton </i>in the first place. Even if Weezer were able to come up with something as potent as <i>Pinkerton</i>, would we recognize it?</p>
<p>I suppose that doesn't give the listener enough credit, but we can do away with the idea that <i>Pinkerton </i>is somehow ""realer"" than other Weezer records. Even if they're more Spike Jones than Spike Jonze these days, it exists on the same continuum as <i>Raditude</i>, <i>Hurley</i>, and yes, even <i>Make Believe--</i> Cuomo's work has always been driven by a need for approval, and once the Green Album<i> </i>was seemingly spawned by popular demand, he's used his band as an embodiment of that. That their ""Memories Tour"" is financially backed by AXE appears terribly ironic, but in reality, Weezer are also a brand that realizes striking a chord with boys obsessed with sex gives you a license to print money. By the same token, it gives me comfort that <i>Pinkerton </i>will remain timeless-- its fanbase is the ultimate renewable resource.</p></div>"|14817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14817-pinkerton-deluxe-edition-death-to-false-metal/|10.0|Ian Cohen

He takes two failed relationships as concrete proof of romantic futility in ""Why Bother?"", and of course, the big reveal in ""Across the Sea"": ""It's all your fault, mama.""</p>
<p>And yetÂ because of all of this emotional baggage, the cathartic power of <i>Pinkerton</i> is second to none. While it's often compared to the Blue Album, <i>Pinkerton </i>bears more similarity to <i>In Utero</i>, a record that also mixed relatively raw alt-rock production, undeniable pop smarts, and a lead singer absolutely freaked the fuck out by fame. But while many sickeningly thought Kurt Cobain's suicide somehow validated his art, Cuomo's self-destruction was more quotidian and relatable, struggling with an unbearable need to be loved but a complete inability to realize the need for it to be reciprocated. It's why <i>Pinkerton </i>isn't misogynistic so much as confused: ""No Other One"" classically mistakes hating yourself for loving someone else, and ""El Scorcho"" reminds that fictional RomCom behavior is actually borderline sociopathic in real life. In fact, the songs most likened to cuddly Blue AlbumÂ Weezer are the darkest-- ""The Good Life"" is Cuomo at the endÂ of his rope, hysterical at the ridiculousness of his self-loathing,Â while a single line in ""El Scorcho"" sums up the core of <i>Pinkerton</i>'sÂ pain: ""I can't talk about it/ I gotta sing about it and make a record.""</p>
<p>The influence of <i>Pinkerton</i> led to hundreds of mostly regrettable bands, but what ultimately distinguishes Weezer is how they sonically mirror the unhinged and private mental terror of its narrator. Weezer actually sound <i>dangerous </i>here in places, in part due to the recording of Dave Fridmann, who maintains a first-take intimacy even when every instrument competes to be the loudest thing in the mix. Weezer's rhythm section rarely gets much credit, but Matt Sharp and Pat Wilson maintain a savage low-end they'd never repeat-- the coda of ""Tired of Sex"" embodies overwhelming and impotent frustration, while the chorus of ""Getchoo"" isn't a hook, it's a fist repeatedly hitting a wall.</p>
<p>The supposedly juvenile feelings of <i>Pinkerton </i>still pack visceral power years after listeners would've supposedly outgrown them. It's a record that reaches well beyond a diaristic look at Cuomo's perversions, and instead asks something more universal: Do we really grow out of our teenage feelings, or do we need something like <i>Pinkerton </i>to expose them as merely being repressed to the point where they mutate? It's heavy stuff, and in the manner of <i>Violent Femmes</i>, you can argue about the sexual politics, the late-career parody, or the total uncoolness of it in retrospect, but even if <i>Pinkerton </i>is ultimately an album that gets one single shot at you, the mark it leaves is indelible.</p>
<p>Befitting a band for the diehards, Weezer's always had certain B-sides that are every bit as loved as the singles. Though this deluxe version contains 25 extra tracks, 16 are alternate versions of material that appeared on <i>Pinkerton</i>: If you need muddy-sounding live versions of ""Why Bother?"" and ""Pink Triangle"", or if ""Across the Sea Piano Noodles"" triggers an uncontrollable completist impulse, consider it an early Christmas. Me, I'm here for their acoustic performances of ""El Scorcho"" and ""The Good Life"" at Y100, the erstwhile alt-rock station I listened to in high school. Otherwise, most of the unreleased B-sides are demo-level in both sound and quality.</p>
<p>The more intriguing prospect is <i>Death to False Metal</i>, proudly touted as ""Weezer's third release of the fourth quarter."" Not really sticking to any concrete organizational principle, Weezer cull unreleased material dating back to the late 90s from a wide range of sources, including their own fans and Toni Braxton. But as a clearinghouse for an increasingly prolific band, <i>False Metal </i>isn't particularly generous. In fact, judging from its wacky title/cover combo, 10-song tracklist, and overall quality, it dubiously achieves Cuomo's stated goal of creating the logical follow-up to <i>Hurley.</i></p>
<p>The power pop Weezer work with maintains its devotees in large part because of its adherence to a kind of strict formula, and having mastered it early in his career, Cuomo can churn it out effortlessly, for better or (mostly) worse. Verses are treated with merely custodial concern before the big hooks, there's the guitar solos that are flashy enough to be noticed but easy enough to learn, and the production glosses everything up to radio-ready ubiquity and anonymity. But once again, there's a laziness that's more annoying than any of Cuomo's ""cool dad"" humor. There's the song about turning up the radio, and it's called ""Turning Up the Radio""-- the irony of its being the result of a YouTube contest is actually kinda fascinating. Cuomo's shown an almost frightening ability to tap into a certain generic teenage frustration, and ""Losing My Mind"" is the song to which you can grouse about your allowance.</p>
<p>Upon reviewing <i>Hurley</i>, I said that Weezer's songs feel more like single-packed sitcoms now, but nothing on that album can match ""The Odd Couple"", which boasts the sort of hack-joke opening line (""I got a PC, you got a Mac"") that Fountains of Wayne wouldn't touch<i>.</i> ""Blowin' My Stack"" and ""I'm a Robot"" are the working-for-the-weekend anthems, and that both have blatantly similar lyrics (""I need cash to pay my bills"" / ""I have to earn money to pay my bills"") suggests a general lack of curatorial oversight to <i>False Metal.</i></p>
<p>At the very least, there's a sense of closure in the simultaneous release of <i>Pinkerton </i>and <i>Death to False Metal</i>: For the past decade, new Weezer albums have been unfavorably judged relative to <i>Pinkerton</i>, and hey, we finally get to do it in real time. But there's always been an underlying unease that, at least in more indie-leaning circles, we're becoming every bit as susceptible to the generation gap that led to the dismissal of <i>Pinkerton </i>in the first place. Even if Weezer were able to come up with something as potent as <i>Pinkerton</i>, would we recognize it?</p>
<p>I suppose that doesn't give the listener enough credit, but we can do away with the idea that <i>Pinkerton </i>is somehow ""realer"" than other Weezer records. Even if they're more Spike Jones than Spike Jonze these days, it exists on the same continuum as <i>Raditude</i>, <i>Hurley</i>, and yes, even <i>Make Believe--</i> Cuomo's work has always been driven by a need for approval, and once the Green Album<i> </i>was seemingly spawned by popular demand, he's used his band as an embodiment of that. That their ""Memories Tour"" is financially backed by AXE appears terribly ironic, but in reality, Weezer are also a brand that realizes striking a chord with boys obsessed with sex gives you a license to print money. By the same token, it gives me comfort that <i>Pinkerton </i>will remain timeless-- its fanbase is the ultimate renewable resource.</p></div>"|14817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14817-pinkerton-deluxe-edition-death-to-false-metal/|3.5|Ian Cohen

Like the band's 2006 self-titled debut and last year's <i>Grand</i>, <i>Sidewalks</i> comes festooned with a grainy, urban image from the pair's home borough with a colorful, graffiti-inspired, screen-printed overlay. It's a look that pledges allegiance to homemade hipster crafting, DIY punk grit, and locavore Brooklyn living-- all of which have contributed to the band's gleefully spazzy sound in the past. But for anyone who has ever heard a Matt &amp; Kim album, the music within this familiar packaging will come as a surprise.</p>
<p>It's not that the twosome has changed their ingredients. Matt Johnson still sings in his nasal-nerd yelp. His synths still mostly eschew gloss in favor of buzz. He still favors remedial, right-hand-only melodies. Kim Schifino's punk drum sound is still big and sloppy. And her rare vocal turns still mostly serve a background-cheerleader role. But it's the way the band's new producer, Ben Allen, combines those typical ingredients that makes for such an unusual taste. Allen, who was once Diddy's in-house engineer at Bad Boy and who recorded Gnarls Barkley's breakthrough debut (as well as indie rock touchstones like Animal Collective's <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i>), adds some hip-hop swagger and studio polish to Matt &amp; Kim's formerly enthusiastically amateurish punk sound. Therefore, songs like album opener ""Block After Block"" and first single ""Camera"" rely not on propulsive synth riffs or buoyant, messy melodies, but on repetitive, rhythmic chords that almost sound like samples and drums that sound mechanical (instead of manic).</p>
<p>Despite those two tracks, this studio experimentation frequently backfires. The band excels when its raw, rollicking songs gallop forward, carried by passion and elation, and its live shows are unbridled explosions of good vibes and raucous energy. Like a smiley Ramones, Matt &amp; Kim use a cartoonish formula as their fuel; getting serious was a risk for them. It works on the bittersweet sleigh bells-and-piano ballad ""Northeast"", which poignantly captures the premature nostalgia for youth at which the band excels. But <i>Sidewalks </i>often inflates the worst attributes of Matt &amp; Kim's big sound (overly simplistic lyrics, crude synth melodies, shouty singing) and smothers much of its sugar-rush energy and joyously defiant attitude in studio flourishes.</p></div>"|14806.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14806-sidewalks/|6.3|Rebecca Raber

Earth, featuring soon-to-be Melvin Joe Preston in its second lineup, intended for those seven tracks to serve as its debut. Record label decisions interfered. Three of those tracks were released a year later via Sub Pop, on the out-of-print EP <i>Extra-Capsular Extraction</i>; four more were released a decade later via No Quarter, as an addendum to the also out-of-print reissue of the live disc <i>Sunn Amps and Smashed Guitars</i>. Aside from message board bootlegs, this new Southern Lord collection marks the debut of this material as an uninterrupted whole, as it was originally intended. Not limited to riffs stretched like steel over minimal, militant percussion, <i>A Bureaucratic Desire</i>-- Earth's first EP plus two grueling mid-tempo blasts, a quasi-ballad featuring Kurt Cobain, and an oppressive closer-- now showcases the breadth of Dylan Carlson's vision from the start.</p>
<p>Doubtlessly, 1993's <i>Earth 2: Special Low Frequency Version</i> will forever remain a sea change moment for both Earth as a band and heavy metal as a form. Over three colossal tracks, Carlson and Dave Harwell treated riff and tone like mutual life forces, using one to explore the other. <i>Earth 2</i> is an unapologetic, overpowering statement. Even almost 20 years later, even after inspiring legions of better-selling followers and spawning the bulk of a genre, that album still feels utterly vibrant and odd. Without booming drums, lacerated vocals, or dark-side imagery, opener ""Seven Angels"" is as suffocating as the best black metal, as moving as Carlson's idols in Black Sabbath.</p>
<p>But <i>A Bureaucratic Desire</i> persuasively argues for a reconsideration of what Earth accomplished-- or, more specifically, just how early: It took Justin Broadrick's Godflesh the better
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
part of another decade to make industrial metal with a drum machine that's as compelling as ""Geometry of Murder"" and ""German Dental Work"". Though loud and lumbering, both tracks maneuver with finesse and agility, two basses and a guitar sliding through the big beats. Especially at the start, ""Divine and Bright"" displays an undercurrent of prettiness and radiance. Earth would touch upon the idea again with 1995's <i>Phase 3: Thrones and Dominions</i> and finally explore fully a decade later when Carlson reformed the band as an elegant tortoise-like vehicle for slow blues. Even as Kurt Cobain hums and Kelly Canary howls above the mid-tempo riff, there's a certain redemption to the music, as if this all this doom eventually lifts like a fog. That feeling won't last too long, though: Closer ""Dissolution 1"" is a sluggish, grim march that grinds through one riff over and over again, the drum machine beating against the changes like a whip. It's quintessential nihilistic doom metal-- no hope except an end.</p>
<p>Those wary of investing again in music they already own should pay special attention to the credits here. Mell Dettmer remastered these tapes, which got little such attention the first time they were released. Dettmer has worked not only on recent Southern Lord albums by Sunn O))) and Wolves in the Throne Room, but also on music by Sleep, Zoroaster, and Eyvind Kang. Her mastering job here is warm, loud and careful, adding a glow to the massive tidal sweeps of ""Ouroboros Is Broken"" and emphasizing the drone that hums beneath the whole thing (something also emphasized by the reformed Earth in 2006, thanks to Steve Moore's organ work on Hibernaculum.) ""A Bureaucratic Desire for Revenge, Parts 1 and 2"" clamp down harder, too, the percussion pushing through the guitars with more gusto, every edge of every riff feeling more like a new rupture. If it's been years since you've listened to these songs, as it had been for me when this reissue arrived, you might believe you're hearing them for the first time. And if you've never heard Earth this early, get ready to change your conceptions: The fountainheads of drone metal have been surprisingly versatile from the start.</p></div>"|14804.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14804-a-bureaucratic-desire-for-extra-capsular-extraction/|8.0|Grayson Currin

He's got a big, blustery voice, an arrogant snarl, and a strong ear for battering-ram beats. In New York, where vital new rap voices aren't exactly thick on the ground these days, that combination is enough to make him a minor sensation. Crewed up with a suddenly resurgent Cam'ron and serving as the driving force on the slow-building club banger ""Speaking in Tungs"", the recently unknown Vado has built serious momentum over the past year. But more than that, he feels like a man from a time when New York still regularly cranked out hard-edged, uncompromising rap songs that work on a dancefloor. New York doesn't do that very often anymore. <i>Nobody</i> really does that very often anymore. And yet here's Vado.</p>
<p>On <i>Slime Flu</i>, his solo debut, Vado shows just how much mileage he can get out of a somewhat limited style. Originally conceived as a mixtape rather than an album, <i>Slime Flu</i> varies in tempo and intensity but never in outlook. There are no attempts at any sort of crossover here, and even club-ready tracks like ""Speaking in Tungs"" are pretty rare. And unlike his mentor Cam'ron, Vado's not a word-drunk stylist. Instead, he's a straight-ahead barker, with a voice that uncannily recalls Cam's old buddy Jim Jones. But Vado sticks to beats with a pitbull tenacity; even when his punchlines don't land, he makes them work just through the force of his delivery. His ad-libs are great: ""<i>Hunh</i>!"", ""<i>Sliiiiime</i>!"". And he's ballsy enough to attempt a debut album with barely any guests; even Cam only shows up twice.</p>
<p>And because Vado has an energy and a confidence that so few of his elders display anymore, <i>Slime Flu</i> instantly stands out by recalling a very specific late-90s moment. Vado, a guy who probably shouldn't be asked to carry a full-length by himself at this point in his career, makes it work anyway by doing the little things right. He doesn't water down his boasts, keeping things specific and local, trusting you to keep up: ""Dine in that Peter Luger/ Large platter under the napkin, I keep the Ruger."" He attacks blaring synthetic tracks like ""Beat Knockin"" and ""Polo"" without the slightest bit of hesitation. He has fun with low-key wealth signifiers without overdoing it: ""They like, 'Man, that kid glow'/ In the Pepto Bismol-colored Gran Turismo."" He resists the temptation to paint grand Rick Ross-type pictures of his criminal past, sticking instead to truer-to-life stuff about running credit card scams, being a two-bit hustler. On a late-album troika of slow, sinister tracks (""Bullets &amp; Gun Smoke"", ""Crimesquare"", ""Snapped), he proves that he can do insinuating atmosphere even better than he can do all-out neck-snap bangers. With everything working in his favor, I almost don't mind that he placed tracks called ""Polo"" and ""Rugby Down"" on the <i>same album</i>.</p>
<p>The amazing thing: Many of the best recent Vado tracks, the ones that have been circulating on the Internet for the past few months, didn't make the album for whatever reason (sample clearance, most likely). And still, the album works. It might not rearrange anyone's brain, but sometimes a blast of time-honored regional bravado is exactly what you need in your life. And if there's more where that came from, we could be looking at the beginning of a very serious career.</p></div>"|14808.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14808-slime-flu/|7.7|Tom Breihan

A recently published article in the <i>Chicago Reader</i> fleshes out the story: The 24-year-old leader Dexter Tortoriello spent time in Hawaii with partner Megan Messina earlier this year, made some field recordings, and created a song called ""Endless Spring"" once back in Chicago. The remainder of the group's debut album, <i>All Night</i>, was written in a nearly one-week stint after being signed to Lefse. Houses' first live performances were at CMJ last month, and as of the time of the interview for the <i>Reader</i> piece, they still hadn't practiced for the first time.</p>
<p>So it seems safe to assume that Houses may not have been a labor-intensive project, which comes across on the record. Although <i>All Night</i> possesses a pleasant enough downtempo glow, provided mostly by Dexter's murmured, multi-tracked, low-register vocals, the record also sounds largely rushed and unfinished. Save for its early leaks, the upbeat (and identical-sounding) ""Reds"" and ""Soak It Up"", the majority of these songs sound like sketches for something larger or at least something more complete. Many melodies trail off or peter out early into washy textures, as if Dexter's laptop had run out of juice before he got a chance to add another preset. When the songs end, it's easy to forget them.</p>
<p>There are a few moments where the lack of structure works to Houses' benefit, like on the cinematic, evocative closer ""Sun Fills"", or the phased-out trails of ""Rose Book"". But even the most sonically involved moments are cheapened by an ill-advised tactic of the duo's own design. During the mixing process, there were crackles and warbles and, in Houses' words, ""imperfections"" added to <i>All Night</i> in order to give the listener the feeling of listening to the record on vinyl. If you've spent part of 2010 smacking your forehead at the millennial generation's obsession with nostalgia, feel free to roll your eyes. If you're just someone wondering why this record sounds like it could use more craft, well, there's one possible answer.</p></div>"|14815.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14815-all-night/|5.1|Larry Fitzmaurice

Both Kurt Cobain and Tupac Shakur spent much of their waking lives being their own best eulogizers; the Notorious B.I.G. named his debut album <i>Ready to Die</i>; and Jeff Buckley, to many, seemed fragile and vulnerable throughout his life. For those who spent years following his considerably quieter trajectory, so did Elliott Smith.</p>
<p>Where those other musicians pushed the dynamics of their chosen genres, Smith achieved his by inverse means. His real-life meekness, softness, and raw emotion never demanded or required anything as tragically operatic as cavernous reverb, barbed wire guitars, or ominous meditations on his own legacy as a musician. With the studio-produced exceptions of 1998's sublime <i>XO</i> and 2000's <i>Figure 8</i>, both funded on Dreamworks' dime, Smith's legacy was largely achieved via a house style that's about as common and as ordinary as it gets: a guy and an acoustic guitar.</p>
<p>Smith's hallmark, then, was his virtuosity: not just as a guitarist, though he frequently made one sound like two and two sound like four, or as a songwriter, though he rigorously engineered dazzlingly complicated chord sequences and melodies, but also in his singing, which had the singular quality of sounding hushed, hangdog, affable, and sweetly melodic all at once. His lyrics, meanwhile, alternated with conflicted ripples of wisdom, longing, and adolescent angst, the sweetness of the music often belying the sentiment underneath.<i></i></p>
<p><i>An Introduction To...</i> is Kill Rock Stars' pitch at a Smith career primer, and although one could get caught up in questioning the need for any such anthology in the download era, it is pretty fantastically difficult to fault as a collection of songs, and KRS' intentions and target audience are clear. Ranging from Smith's relatively spotty 1994 solo debut <i>Roman Candle</i> (from which only one selection appears) through to ""
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
Miss Misery"", the pivot point of his career, knowingly offered here in an early, pre-Oscar nominated incarnation, through to a few selections from <i>New Moon</i>, 2007's posthumous collection of vaulted odds and ends, it's more a testimony to the ferociously high quality of work that comprised Smith's catalogue than any triumph of curation.</p>
<p>As the song selection goes, though, <i>An Introduction To...</i> is as tasteful and as thorough as one could reasonably demand. As you might expect, given the title and the label, it is distinctly light on material from Smith's Dreamworks years, during which he was arguably at the peak of his powers, but it makes up for that thinness by offering up a judicious selection from Smith's indie breakthrough, 1998's <i>Either/Or</i>, as well as a few slightly rarer versions of fan favorites, like the single version of ""Happiness"" and a newly remastered version of 1997's ""Last Call"".</p>
<p>As is the way with these sorts of things, <i>An Introduction To...</i> will also invite the more familiar listener to play a game of soft scrutiny and reflection on what may or may not be a few sins of omission, but of course that's not really the point. The point is that there are lots of people who haven't yet had the occasion to discover Elliott Smith, and ultimately this gives them a chance to scratch away at the bittersweet reality of his work, at how conflicted he sounded, at how bitterly unresolved his career remains, and how every single song still somehow feels like both a confection and a dagger.</p></div>"|14819.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14819-an-introduction-to/|8.8|Mark Pytlik

A metal band to the bone, Kylesa stomp the clichÃ©s right out of psych-rock on <i>Spiral Shadow</i>. The Georgia band's new album, their fifth in less than a decade, is the next step in a pretty seamless evolution that's hidden increasingly complex (and catchy!) music behind an attack that still hits with the in-the-red rawness of hardcore.</p>
<p>With two percussionists going full-tilt-- check the way they build to a Godspeed You! Black Emperor-esque climax on ""Distance Closing In"", or the Can-on-uppers groove that pushes ""Drop Out"" to its final, roaring refrain-- Kylesa are as rhythmically complex (and diverse) as any current band that might pop up as ""hard rock"" when you rip the album to iTunes. Likewise with an arsenal of arena-era Floyd keyboard effects, and production that's incredibly dense with trippy sonic embellishments while still offering psych's sensual spaciousness, Kylesa's music is more enveloping than ever. All of which might lead you to expect meandering 10-minute ""journeys,"" the kind of spaced-out noodling beloved only by a certain kind of stoner. That couldn't be further from the truth. Call Kylesa prog-- or even psych, really-- at your peril. Few modern prog or psych bands offer the kind of face-caving, riffs-first punch Kylesa bring to each tune. And tunes they are, with shout-along hooks that reliably hold things together between the double-drummer showcases and the bursts of uncut, old-school metal-flash soloing.</p>
<p>A groove band above all else, like so many of their swampy Southern forebears, Kylesa use their two-drummer setup not to show off their skill with complex polyrhythms but to give those grooves even more heft and drive. And whether bellowed by Philip Cope or sung with witchy intensity by Laura Pleasants, just about every song has a chorus that immediately stamps itself on
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
your brain. In that sense, <i>Spiral Shadow</i> is damn near a pop album. Of course, only ""Don't Look Back"" actually sounds radio-ready, but gloriously so, with a fat ear-worm riff, swooning wordless background harmonies straight out of the Kevin Shields playbook, and the biggest of the album's big-ass choruses. And ambitious as they are, Kylesa always come back to pleasing the core headbanging audience. They still admirably deliver when it comes to metal's air-punching, meat-and-potatoes riffs, and they want to keep the energy as high as possible, which is perhaps why they've been able to hold onto much of the no-bullshit-allowed hardcore crowd, even as their music has become less uncompromisingly abrasive.</p>
<p>Ten years into an unbroken wave of revitalized and omnivorous metal bands, it feels almost ridiculous to have to keep saying this, but: If you're not paying at least some attention to this stuff, you're screwing up. Like many of the best ""extreme"" metal albums in 2010, <i>Spiral Shadow</i> is less about alienating outsiders through heaviness, volume, or violence than it is about blurring those extremes (hook and noise, dreamy and ragged, virtuosity and bluntness, metal and pop) on the same record, on the same songs. Captivatingly intricate without sacrificing rough and tough forward drive, accessible without sinking into commercialized blandness, Kylesa offer the pretty irrefutable truth that metal's still the best place to find rock that actually rocks, that there's plenty of boot-to-the-sternum kick left in the old beast after all.</p></div>"|14805.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14805-spiral-shadow/|8.4|Jess Harvell

It featured various remixes, a previously viral song written with Chairlift's Caroline Polachek set to the video for Justin Bieber's ""Never Let You Go"", as well as a cut called ""Space Around the Feel Station"", a mashup of Washed Out's ""Feel It All Around"" and Slowdive's ""Souvlaki Space Station"". The result sounded exactly how you'd expect-- it's a god-awful mess-- but it also highlighted an important facet of the NYC new-wave outfit's personality: They aren't cool, and they never really have been, even though bandleader Jorge Elbrecht did time in the enigmatic, now-dormant 1980s-worshipping collective Lansing-Dreiden. Violens embrace clean production, anthemic choruses, and a lack of reverb-obscured shyness-- they're so sonically far away from the hip-to-death Brooklyn scene that they might as well be in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Of course, all that is catnip for those longing for the early-aughts halcyon days of shiny Manhattan rock (the Strokes, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Interpol), and <i>Amoral</i> will undoubtedly play like gangbusters to that crowd. And why shouldn't it? If nothing else, Elbrecht and his cohorts have made a worthy debut that evokes early-80s new pop, Nagel paintings, and neon lighting as much as it does the stadium-sized downcast bombast of Echo and the Bunnymen. That messed-up, multi-color face on the cover might hint at the band's slight psych leanings, but it certainly doesn't represent how the record sounds, which is expensive and expansive. Rhythms crisply snap, guitars sound bright, and even the occasional torrent of feedback is slathered in gold.</p>
<p>Violens are at their best when they keep things snappy and upbeat, like on the downward spiral of ""Acid Reign"" or the Boo Radleys-recalling ""The Dawn of Your Happiness Is Rising"". By contrast, they get themselves a little lost on <i>Amoral</i>'s back half, as ""Trance-Like Turn"" and ""Another Strike Restrained"" turn the course from sweep-y to sleepy. Meanwhile, the record's genre diversions, such as the paisley pop of ""Violent Sensation Descends"" and the stormgazing ""Could You Stand to Know?"",  suggest that while Violens may know their sonic touchstones inside and out, they're better sticking to the haircut-obsessed sounds showcased on <i>Amoral</i>'s standouts. They're not going to book any D.I.Y. basement shows or anything by doing so, but when you sound as huge as these guys do, the idea of a stage itself becomes irrelevant.</p></div>"|14813.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14813-amoral/|6.7|Larry Fitzmaurice

She sings words, but they barely register-- her soft, wispy voice indicates a human presence and conveys a shy personality more than it expresses any specific ideas. Her arrangements are hypnotic and often quite beautiful, built upon layers of fragile guitar lines, warm bass notes, rhythm, and ambient tones. It's all very delicate and finely detailed, and it consistently calls the listener's attention to its own space and structure. At least in the sense that putting on one of her albums can feel like entering a very specific space of her own devising removed from the logic and conventions of ordinary places, her music is rather like an audio approximation of installation art.</p>
<p><i>Opticks</i>, Nes' second album, isn't dramatically different in style and tone from her debut,Â <i>Ames Room</i>, but her craft and production values have improved in immediately obvious ways. The songs are tighter and more disciplined, instrumental parts ring out with a crystalline clarity, and guest musicians add variety to her palette. Her compositions have become more dynamic, but in subtle ways-- despite a consistently placid mood throughout the record, the pieces in her songs are constantly moving and progressing. At her best, Nes' songs filter the steady repetitions and gradual transformations of minimalist music through the aesthetics and instrumentation of bedroom electronica and dreamy indie rock, creating a hybrid that feels familiar and cozy while still being singular. Even a cover of ""Silver &gt; Blue"", a song from Thurston Moore's <i>Trees Outside the Academy</i>, comes out sounding like a Nes original.</p>
<p>At this point in her career, Nes has carved out an interesting and appealing niche, but she is still developing as a songwriter. Her pieces are uniformly beautiful and thoughtful, but her tunes and instrumental motifs tend not to stick out in one's memory. Tracks such as ""The Glass Harp"", ""The Shades"", and ""Crystals"" reward close listening with moments of quiet brilliance, but if you're not moved to pay full attention, most of <i>Opticks</i> will wash over you as an indistinct haze. To some extent, this is just what happens with quiet, introverted music intended to be taken on its own terms-- it gets shrugged off, overlooked, underrated. However, if you look at the incremental progress from <i>Ames Room</i> to <i>Opticks</i>, it's clear that this is the work of an artist who is still finding her way, and there is reason to believe that bolder, more immediately tuneful work will come in her future, hopefully without sacrificing the muted, low-key quality that makes her art so attractive and charming.</p></div>"|14814.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14814-opticks/|7.3|Matthew Perpetua

And the end result? An overcooked mess. We've been spoiled over the last couple of years by this nightmarish process' actually resulting in some contemporary classics-- <i>Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Part II</i> and <i>Sir Lucious Left Foot: the Son of Chico Dusty </i>sit up there at the top of the pile-- but for just about everybody else in this position, things have been kind of frustrating.</p>
<p><i>24 Hour Karate School</i>, Ski Beatz's long-awaited, producer-driven showcase, is one of those unfortunate examples of a vaporware album losing something in the process of actually making it to end-product existence. Heard Mos Def's high-caliber verses on early leaks ""Taxi"" and ""Cream of the Planet""? They're erased from the final release, the tracks reduced to a chassis without a motor. You want a substantial album? Lop off those two aforementioned instrumentals, and the whole thing barely cracks a half hour, all truncated bars and dim spotlights. Oh, and while you were waiting for this record to drop, Ski's other big production job-- Curren$y's ridiculously superb <i>Pilot Talk-- </i>wound up looming a lot larger over it, and its sequel is cresting on the horizon. (Curren$y even shows up on three tracks here, all of which are good but none of which is ""Michael Knight"" amazing.) From a hotly anticipated epic to the red-headed stepchild of its producer's juggernaut of a year-- that's a disappointing downturn.</p>
<p>Maybe you could blame the lyrical side of the album. Some tracks feature top-of-their-game MCs who don't get enough time to shine: Jean Grae, Jay Electronica, and Joell Ortiz all bust out of the gate on ""Prowler 2"", but divide three verses by two-and-a-half minutes and things feel a bit rushed no matter how tight the performances are. Some feature unknown quantities who make shaky early impressions-- Rugz D Bewler torpedoing a couple of decent out-of-nowhere verses with a cloying sing-song hook on ""Super Bad"", and Stalley doing his best to overcome the whole introductory conceit of ""S.T.A.L.L.E.Y."" with a competent but personality-deficient appearance. And some of the veteran star-power names are underwhelming to the point of disillusioning. When Jim Jones mushmouthily rhymes half his lines with some variation of the word ""shit"" on ""Go"" or Camp Lo shrug through a faint Xerox of their vintage intoxicated abstraction on ""Back Uptown"" (no <i>Saturday Night</i>), it's enough to make you wonder if their verses were placeholders for more thought-out performances that never arrived in time for the album's eventual release.</p>
<p>But there are plenty of salvageable parts here, not the least of which are the beats themselves, evidence enough that this album started as a showcase project rather than just a clearinghouse for misfit remainders. Ski's had a welcome career-extending renaissance as a dude who knows his way around modernized gloss without dulling its edges. He sounds opulent whether he's deploying a Love Unlimited-style horn section (""Nothing But Us""; ""Cream of the Planet""), snares-and-synths bionicism (""Do It Big!!"", ""Super Bad""), or heavy-rock guitar snarl (""Go""; ""Prowler 2""; ""I Got Mines""). All those styles clash a little when taken in succession, and they don't cohere into much of a bigger whole aside from the shared impact of blunted, 20-story drums, but more 1990s-vet producers should be this adventurous.  What we wound up with here is better than having a few scattered ideas sit in limbo on some <i>Skitox</i> shit, and the unofficial ""real version"" of this album with the restored Mos Def verses isn't that hard to come by anyhow if you know where to find leaks. But when a record spurs more thoughts about what could have been and what's soon to come than an unworried enthusiasm over what actually <i>is</i>, it's probably for the best to just move on.</p></div>"|14785.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14785-24-hour-karate-school/|6.0|Nate Patrin

The nominally dance-punk (but really, just dance) band has absorbed the polyrhythmic and multicultural lessons of post-No Wave groups like ESG and Liquid Liquid, updating the percolating good-times vibe with high-octane guitars and modern polish. This year, they followed up their most brazen album, 2007's <i>Myth Takes</i>, with the solid but low-impact <i>Strange Weather, Isnât It?</i>, which is long on proficient dance beats but short on inspired hooks. That album's ""Jamie, My Intentions Are Bass"" is a nice little number that fakes toward blues-rock before veering into taut funk, but as sleazy pillow-talk jams go, it's a pale imitation of <i>Myth Takes</i>â ""Must Be the Moon"". That <i>Strange Weatherâ</i>s standout track (whichÂ heads up this remix EP) is a rehash of prior glory exemplifies the LP's limitations.</p>
<p>A decent remix either stands on its own as a thoughtful piece of music or does something interesting and creative with the source material. A really good remix does both. Ex-A.R.E. Weapons member Thomas Bullock scores a really good one with his deep retooling of ""The Hammer"". The original version, a dreamy ice-pricked groove with passages of molten force, was already one of <i>Strange Weather</i>âs most alluring tracks. Bullock dials down its entrancing minimalism even tighter, with an epically tense build that muscles through jackhammer drum rolls before finally unclenching into a euphoric lope. It has the internal cohesion of an original production. By way of contrast, Canyons' remix of the same song is classically well-wrought, withÂ a breezier texture and dubby vocal edits, but its vampy quality is very pronounced when heard next to Bullock's vision and drive: You never forget for a second that you're hearing someone tweaking and filtering !!! stems.</p>
<p>People talk a lot of shit about indie remix EPs, and with good reason. At worst, they'reÂ pointless cash-grabs; at best, they tend to include a few standout mixes. But like other indie groups who've released surprisingly fertile remix EPs, such as Hot Chip and LCD Soundsystem, !!! uses dance music as a foundation so remixers have tons to work with. This EP actually achieves the feat of casting a revelatory light on some album tracks. In the battle over ""The Most Certain Sure"", Bibio's predictable IDM mix loses out to Liv Spencer's slinky nighttime crawl, but both draw out hidden moods that were latent in the original. And Tim Goldsworthy should getÂ a medalÂ for turning the innocuous indie-funk of ""Steady as the Sidewalk Cracks"" into a wide-eyed art-pop celebration. All in all, here's the rare remix EP that I'll probably listen to more than the original record.</p></div>"|14811.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14811-jamie-my-intentions-are-bass-ep/|6.8|Brian Howe

His rapping here is as great as ever, and many of the songs rank with his best material. But the LP arrived without much impact: Its singles failed to catalyze much of an audience, never mind reach the ""Lollipop""-level ubiquity they aimed for. But even the excitement surrounding his release from jail this spring had dissipated by the end of the summer, as he was eclipsed by Waka Flocka Flame as rap's public enemy #1. Considering Gucci re-energized gangster rap with a new style and methodology for rap performance just as a restless media elite had begun writing the subgenre's obituaries, <i>The Appeal</i> definitely feels like a missed opportunity.</p>
<p>But some of it is great. The tracks by Memphis producer Drumma Boi in particular seem to catch Gucci at his best; the stomping ""Trap Talk"" was unveiled earlier on the <i>Jewelry Selection</i> mixtape, and it's nearly bested here by ""What's It Gonna Be"", with its memorable double-time chorus and autobiographical boasts. Tracks like ""Dollar Sign and ""Weirdo"" offer fresh takes on the Gucci Mane archetype. <i>The Appeal</i>'s best moment is ""It's Alive"", built around an atypically atmospheric Swizz beat. Gucci slurs in a relaxed, streamlined flurry of images and boasts that somehow manage to sound simultaneously fresh and ageless, as if he were marking a mile-point in rap history. Longtime Gucci producer Zaytoven offers a novel direction on ""Brand New"", although his other contribution, ""Missing"", is a generic rehash of much better tracks the duo have previously released. But it's not this conservative approach that sinks the rest of the record; it's a different kind, one that suggests that Gucci's label, and perhaps even Gucci himself, didn't quite understand the nature of his appeal to the public.</p>
<p>One of the things that set him apart early on was his musicality. In an era of scarce investment, Gucci seemed to realize he had to do it all. His ear for hooks and concepts, best illustrated by tracks like ""Lemonade"", exemplified how rappers had to take responsibility for constructing pop songs if they wanted to build that millennial-era populist audience. And in fact, this era's most successful rappers, like Drake and Soulja Boy, seem to follow a similar mindset.</p>
<p>But Gucci, unlike Drake or Soulja Boy, is 30 years old. In interviews, he has stated a desire to work with the beatmakers of the super-producer era of his career's early days. On <i>The State vs. Radric Davis</i>, Scott Storch and Bangladesh laced him with beats that emulated and fleshed out the blueprints set by Gucci collaborators like Fatboi and Zaytoven. On <i>The Appeal</i>, the co-authors are considerably more tone-deaf. Swizz's lead single ""Gucci Time""-- which recently charted just below ""Beat It Up,"" a Gucci mixtape track from mid-2009-- is an attempt to wed Gucci's lyrics to a traditionalist ""banger,"" but there is no artist-production synergy. The Neptunes fare even worse; although ""Haterade"" features some of Gucci's better writing, the song itself is a cocktail-bar-lite disaster, with a crooning Pharell hook. Wyclef's beat is a nice diversion until the chorus returns. But what hurts the most is how on-point Gucci's actual rapping is throughout. It's not like he fell off as a performer; it's just that he was already making great pop, which left to his own devices was more interesting than the work he tried to buy with a bigger budget.</p>
<p>Gucci's label, in the rush to transition him into a Proper Album career path, may have helped cut him off at the legs. His buzz and popularity grew because of the overlap between his prolific creativity and the breadth of his musicality; if you were more a fan of his hardcore street tracks, his tracks ""for the ladies,"" funny cuts, straight acrobatic rapping, or all of those things wrapped into one song, there was a Gucci song for you. He was one of the first to start creating music that worked perfectly in this era of free musical distribution, a non-stop flood of verses, guest spots and, most importantly, individual songs, created and released in an overwhelming manner with little respect for chronology. While his label forced websites to take down Gucci's older free  mixtapes, this constant stream began to dry up this year. Gucci released  only two official mixtapes (with redundant material) and a scattering of guest verses in the lead-up to <i>The Appeal</i>. Perhaps the most important lesson here for listeners is that waiting for the ""real album,"" in rap music 2010, is an utter anachronism.</p></div>"|14809.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14809-the-appeal-georgias-most-wanted/|7.3|David Drake

It's also been the only constant in his music over the last 30 years; the man shreds styles as a rule, often as soon as listeners have adjusted to his latest changeup. So hardcore Sylvian-ophiles are usually in it for That Voice, which has grown warmer and deeper and more restrained with experience while still being recognizable within seconds. It's the reliable pleasure that's carried listeners through Sylvian's less-than-fertile periods, the collaborations that didn't quite spark, the styles that proved an ill fit for the singing, all the downsides to his ultimately admirable brand of creative restlessness.</p>
<p>Sylvian's voice is certainly the only constant on <i>Sleepwalkers</i>, a collection of his 21st century non-album collaborations that's coherently assembled, which means it flows like an album, but artistically all over the map, which means the individual songs range from several undeniable keepers to a small handful of wince-inducing missteps. Naturally, it's the missteps which stand out on first listen. Sylvian's singing, though it's more versatile than his reputation for mannered art-rock melodrama suggests, proves very, very awkward when dropped into a slab of George Michael-esque blue-eyed soul (""Money for All"", complete with Vegas-y backup singers). The oddity of appropriating the style doesn't necessarily make the song fun to listen to, but it certainly dispels the rumors that Sylvian's hardened into a pop-spurning experimentalist over the last decade.</p>
<p>Some old-school Sylvian fans have been turned off by his 21st century albums, which have stretched verse-chorus structure to its limit while recasting both improv-style instrumental abstraction and avant electronics as a songwriter's tools. Personally I think 2003's <i>Blemish</i> and 2009's <i>Manafon</i> are minor masterpieces, but it's easy to understand why folks who fell in love with Japan's lush, tight synth-rock might not be too keen on the way Sylvian's albums now hide the pleasure of his voice inside the forbidding box marked ""free music."" If you're in that camp, <i>Sleepwalkers</i>, despite its wildly varying quality, may come as some relief. Here, in addition to the knotty electro-acoustic/glitch stuff, brilliant <i>Blemish</i>-esque tracks like ""Sleepwalkers"" and ""Transit"", we also get Sylvian goes country (""Ballad of a Deadman""), Sylvian goes piano bar torch singer (""Playground Martyrs""), and so on.</p>
<p>Sylvian's genre-takes are always a little skewed, as befitting a guy who's worked with Holger Czukay, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and other great avant/pop synthesists. Sometimes this tweaking adds frisson to what might have otherwise been too stale, too traditional. Sylvian-goes-country twangs for sure, but it also squeals and clonks and squirms with little Matmos-like <i>musique concrÃ¨te</i> embellishments. But on a few occasions Sylvian's sound-art touches feel like oddball window dressing on flimsy tunes. And when one of those <i>Blemish</i>/<i>Manafon</i> style songs pops up, you're struck by what a singular sound-world Sylvian's solo albums have created in the last 10 years. That's not an achievement to chuck away lightly, so it's good that Sylvian has these one-off collaborations as release valves. <i>Sleepwalkers</i> naturally doesn't draw you into a world as fully realized as one of Sylvian's true albums. But his fearlessness, if not quite his versatility, at tackling new sounds (and even new structures) is still a beacon, especially at an age when many of his contemporaries have fossilized into post-punk heritage acts.</p></div>"|14812.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14812-sleepwalkers/|6.0|Jess Harvell

That's the War on Drugs frontman Adam Granduciel, on ""Baby Missiles"", the jittery, sorta-opening track to the Philadelphia ragged-rock band's new EP, <i>Future Weather.</i> It's literally impossible to tell who the friend in question is, but those familiar with the band's genesis could take a stab. Granduciel and Kurt Vile founded the band back in 2003, toiling away for five years and with various band members in the Philadelphia scene, leading up to their ""big break"" when Secretly Canadian took the group under their wing and put out their 2008 debut, <i>Wagonwheel Blues</i>. Then, Vile's solo material gained even greater attention than that of his main band, and he struck out on his own. He didn't leave the band, not exactly-- he's still a member, albeit not one who appears on <i>Future Weather</i>.</p>
<p>Laws of physics aside, it doesn't seem like too much of a stretch to suggest that Granduciel and Vile have some sort of telepathy when creatively separated from each other. Just as Vile's latest EP, <i>Square Shells</i>, moved away from the tape-hissed classic rock sound of his previous releases and toward a lonelier, more reverb-coated place, <i>Future Weather</i> also takes a trip down a lyrically overcast road, littered with regret, isolation, and loss. The sentiments are frequently naked in presentation, especially in the lovelorn ""Comin' Through"" and just plain lonely ""Brothers"".</p>
<p>Adding to the record's bummed-out moodÂ is the possibility that this release resulted from a point of frustration and personal disappointment. The majority of the EP was taken from seemingly since-scrapped sessions from the War on Drugs' follow-up to <i>Wagonwheel Blues</i>, suggesting that this release could represent a creative hand-washing from Granduciel, who recorded the majority of the EP by himself, with drummer Mike Zanghi and multi-instrumentalist Dave Hartley filling in the gaps as necessary.Â Yet <i>Future Weather</i> doesn't sound rush-released-- instead, the band's compositional strengths and flair for sonic texture have clearly taken a leap forward. (See the sea of tangled guitars and far-off harmonica in ""Brothers"" or the knotty shuffle of ""Comin' Through"".) This stuff still sounds homespun, but the reel-to-reel feel of <i>Wagonwheel Blues</i> is mostly gone and replaced with something more fully realized.Â With one foot in the past and one foot in the uncertainty of now, it's exciting to see what these guys' next step will be.</p></div>"|14803.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14803-future-weather-ep/|7.6|Larry Fitzmaurice

This project's latest collection, <i>What It Means to Be Left-Handed</i>, continues in the vein of 2007's self-titled LP, in that every song features vocals, choruses, and pop melodies. It's a move even further away from Mice Parade's noisy, knotty beginnings. Though Pierce's percussive virtuosity has been the lone constant through all of Mice Parade's stylistic changes, on this new album it is less a driving force, ceding power to the delightful melodies created by arpeggiated string instruments and vocals. In doing so, Mice Parade have completed their transformation into a more traditional rock band, but luckily they sidestep sounding commonplace by finding bliss in this newfound structure.</p>
<p><i>What It Means to Be Left-Handed</i> is an album marked by the uptempo musical traditions of faraway places, from West African highlife to Brazilian TropicÃ¡lia and Spanish flamenco. It's not that Mice Parade hasn't explored music from other cultures before-- 2001's <i>Mokoondi</i> is steeped in the sounds of the Far East thanks to its use of the cheng, a Chinese harp, and as its name announces, 2004's <i>Obrigado Saudade</i>, incorporates elements of Brazilian music to a gorgeous, airy effect. But they never sounded quite this omnivorous. Aside from opening track ""Kupanda"", which, with its bouncy, polyrhythmic guitar- and kora-anchored melody and Swahili vocals (courtesy of Rwandan/Ugandan-descended singer Somi), successfully works within one specific world music tradition, Pierce mostly bends and transforms the inflections of his international influences to fit inside his American pop music structures. ""Couches &amp; Carpets"" is a spare, rhythmically driven track buoyed by the rasgueado guitars of flamenco, ""In Between Times"" breathes warmth into a cool, fuzzy shoegaze foundation with a hot-blooded, sing-along chorus and a clap-happy/trebly-guitar highlife breakdown, and ""Fortune of Folly"" melts its West African dueling-guitar intro into a sparse pool of ticky-tacky percussion and minimalist arpeggios that becomes a base for some deadpan 1990s indie rock vocals.</p>
<p>If there is an influence on the album greater than Pierce's musical passport, then it's probably his high school record collection. The moments that aren't globe-trotting are traveling in time, back to the classic Massachusetts college rock of the late 80s and early 90s (see: Sebadoh, Buffalo Tom, the Pixies), which was marked by brooding vocals, pop melodies buried in guitar grit, and sparse arrangements. The choice of the Lemonheads' ""Mallo Cup"" as a one of the album's two covers (the other is a drowsy, bittersweet version of Tom Brosseau's ""Mary Anne"") seems apt, as Pierce's sensitive baritone is a dead ringer for Evan Dando's, not just on that track, but on the entire latter half of the record. Like Dando, Pierce is enamored of girlish, babydoll-voiced singers. On this album, contributions come from Gregory and the Hawk's Meredith Godreau and Temporary Residence-signed singer Caroline Lufkin. The latter adds sweetness and whimsy to his deeper vocal malaise and recalls the <i>It's a Shame About Ray</i>-era duets by Dando and the similarly elfin-voiced Juliana Hatfield.</p>
<p>Overall, the combination of outward-looking and backward-leaning influences on <i>What It Means to Be Left-Handed</i> makes for a pleasing combination of slacker indie rock ennui and joyous, ravenous culture-borrowing. So often, casual listeners give up on a band after a handful of reliably good releases, sensing that the group isn't going to change or that they've already heard everything the artist has to offer. But this album proves that Mice Parade are still capable of not only surprising but also of getting better as they grow.</p></div>"|14779.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14779-what-it-means-to-be-left-handed/|7.4|Rebecca Raber

The A-side was a 13-minute disco track; the B-side, ""Ravers"", was an eight-minute ambient version of a song he'd first recorded as straightforward, folksy indie rock on 2008's <i>Trouble in Dreams</i>. Not counting his contributions to the New Pornographers' <i>Together</i>, this new 12"" features the only two songs Bejar is releasing in 2010. They're both Destroyer tracks, insofar as Bejar wrote and sings/speaks the words, but the music was entrusted to collaborators: Montreal-based ambient Tim Hecker for ""Archer on the Beach"", and Loscil (aka Scott Morgan, who is also Destroyer's drummer) for ""Grief Point"".</p>
<p>Bejar is known for sharp left turns, so like a lot of Destroyer releases,  an ambient 12"" is a predictable surprise. (This is an artist who once answered the question, ""How is this album different from the last one?"" by explaining that, this time, his band didn't know the songs.) In his best work, there's a sense that no idea is above being second-guessed, and that the moment you stop second-guessing yourself is the moment you start sucking.</p>
<p>These new songs find Bejar trying to acclimate himself to unfamiliar territory, while attempting to use that territory's inherent qualities to his advantage. The verses to ""Archer on the Beach"", for example, play on Tim Hecker's grainy, melancholic music by repeating themselves in slight variations: At one point, the archer's arrows are ""stuck inside a peach,"" but later they're ""slightly out of reach."" The words, like the music, are unfixed and variable; they play tricks on what you think you just heard.</p>
<p>""Grief Point""-- the better of the two tracks-- is more of a spoken-word radio play than a song. It begins with the sound of street noise and ends with the words, ""It is done,"" and between, there are minor-key synthesizer patterns, and theatrical effects: a phone, footsteps, someone flicking a lighter. (The track comes from an unreleased movie of the same name, and those sound-design elements are part of what Bejar does in the film.) The effect is like listening to Bejar pacing around an empty room, talking to himself. It's an eerie, subdued version of the character he plays on his records: wide-eyed, wine-drunk, and passionately lecturing an audience of none.</p>
<p>Bejar has already announced a new Destroyer full-length for January called <i>Kaputt</i>. Among the 22-item-long list of themes he included in a press release are fretless bass, 80s Miles Davis, ""the pointlessness of the future of music,"" and Kara Walker, the black American artist most famous for her silhouette images of the Antebellum South-- basically, ""themes"" that will seem freaky and off-putting to people who aren't already sympathetic to his humor and curiosity. But for his fans, this is all code for <i>good news!</i>, and while neither ""Archer on the Beach"" or ""Grief Point"" are on <i>Kaputt</i>'s tracklist, they're promising evidence that Bejar is, conceptually, continuing to do what he does best: destroying.</p></div>"|14796.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14796-archer-on-the-beach-12/|7.1|Mike Powell

It's not dramatic, though. The words come out serenely-- perhaps <i>too</i> serenely. ""What's the  matter?/ You hurt yourself?/ Open your eyes and there was someone else,""  they coo dreamily, shape-shifting underneath a fine mist of guitars and  bass. True to its name, ""Undertow"" sinks in without hurry. Its ambient horror is in the realm of <i>Rosemary's Baby</i> or <i>Heavenly Creatures</i> or the first half of <i>The Shining</i>. Their thrills are far from cheap. And the same sense of ghostliness runs throughout <i>The Fool</i>, a nine-song seance of an album that's as subtle as it is disquieting.</p>
<p>In these days of solitary laptop acts and quick-fizzle pop-up bands, Warpaint's free-floating sound is largely dependent on the uncanny bond between principals and long-time friends Kokal, Wayman, and bassist Jenny Lee Lindberg.  Live, each one is in her own zone, often with eyes shut and head loose. It's almost like watching them make up songs in real-time  at every show, the tangling highs and darting lows  frothing to a natural climax only to dissipate just as easily. Their  chemistry is inexplicable and fascinating to behold. With Kokal and Wayman often singing on either side of a central Lindberg--  who commands attention with her spaced-out sway-- the live attack is engrossing. Together with drummer Stella Mozgawa, Warpaint speak a sultry, desert-rock language that no one else is privy to, but you can't help but want to crack it nonetheless.</p>
<p>And while <i>The Fool</i> doesn't fully capture their brain-melded performances, it's a worthy simulacrum. The songs on which Kokal  takes lead duties tend to be a bit more sinister (when she sings, ""Don't you call anybody else baby cause I'm your  baby still"" on spare ballad ""Baby"", the 10-mile-stare delivery is spooky), while Wayman's verses are more vulnerable. Off-kilter highlight ""Shadows"" has Wayman  stumbling through tinted sidewalks: ""I know I'm afraid/ I'm drunk and  I'm tired/ And the city I walk in feels like it swallows."" The song's  unique, snare-based beat and lonely string plucks aptly re-create  her confusion. Elsewhere, flashes of Stevie Nicks (at her most diffuse)  and Jeff Buckley (at his most daydreamy) meander through. And while sonic comparisons to early Cat Power have been abundant, Warpaint's live prowess and band-oriented sound offer distinct differences, too.</p>
<p>In the middle of ""Baby"", a small bit of George Harrison's <i>White Album</i> favorite ""Long, Long, Long"" sneaks in. ""How I love you,"" sings Kokal,  and then the nod is dropped just as quickly. The group pulled a similar  trick on ""Billie Holiday"", from their<i> Exquisite Corpse</i> EP, on which  they worked some of ""My Guy"" into the track's fabric. Like the  effortlessness that surrounds Warpaint, both references feel  totally instinctive; it's as if they just happened upon them, took what  they needed, and moved on.</p></div>"|14801.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14801-the-fool/|7.2|Ryan Dombal

He released a solo album five years ago that stayed mostly in similar territory to his band with a few stabs outside, but he's otherwise been pretty quiet musically while working on his doctorate and a parallel career as a debate coach. Perhaps due to the demands of writing and soundtrack, his second solo effort, <i>The Effective Disconnect</i>, takes small steps to further nudge the boundaries of his style outward.</p>
<p>One of the primary differences between this and McBride's last solo effort, <i>When the Detail Lost Its Freedom</i>, is textural. <i>Detail</i> had a very specific idea at its heart-- there was a sense that you could hear the air moving between you and every sound, and it gave the record a kind of rough, distant aura. <i>The Effective Disconnect </i>keeps some of the distance, but the sounds are much smoother, more distinct and direct. The rhythmic pulses of these pieces of music are also a lot more varied. ""Girl Nap"" features what sounds like horns calling out long, static drones in a rhythm similar to breathing, which is familiar in McBride's work, but the quicker rhythm of the electric piano that underpins the drones is new.</p>
<p>Other tracks build on that. ""Bee Keepers vs. Warfare Chemicals"" is more rapid than anything I've heard McBride do, with twinkling percussion and rapid chord changes in its opening half. It then shifts to a sparser second movement around deeper, oceanic drones that recall classic Stars of the Lid and closes with a melancholy piano figure. It's interesting to hear how much tension there is between McBride's tendency toward stasis and the need for a little movement to match the visual accompaniment. The biggest surprise is undoubtedly the fact that ""Chamber Minuet"" is somewhat described by its title-- rather than producing an extended, shifting drone, McBride uses the strings here to play active melody. It never coalesces into a real minuet or anything close to one, but to hear those strings finally escape the drone to move a little is almost cathartic.</p>
<p>I haven't seen the documentary that this album soundtracks, but it seems appropriately sad for a film about Colony Collapse Disorder, a confounding affliction that's destroying honey-bee populations around the world and poses a huge threat to food production. On its own, it is occasionally a little sugary, but on the whole, <i>The Effective Disconnect</i> is a satisfying album that should please fans of McBride's other work.</p></div>"|14791.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14791-the-effective-disconnect-music-composed-for-the-documentary-vanishing-of-the-bees/|7.1|Joe Tangari

That's where his dad, country singer James LeBlanc, regularly cut sessions and also where young Dylan got an early musical education.Â You don't hear much Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, or Wilson Pickett in LeBlanc's assured debut,Â <i>Paupers Field</i>, though-- let alone many of the dozens of other country, soul, or rock acts that recorded down there. You do, however, hear a depth of experience somewhat at odds with LeBlanc's age, his sad voice prematurely scarred with regret and haunted by demons (drugs and alcohol reportedly played a role). This palpable darkness helps what could have otherwise been another run-of-the-mill Americana disc rise above anonymity, its evocative textures and atmosphere a welcome respite from too many milquetoast troubadours.</p>
<p><i>Paupers Field</i> draws its name from the place where the poor were buried, and LeBlanc has likened his songs to headstones commemorating ""things that have died in my life."" Given such a heavy outlook, it's no shock the compelling intimacy of songs such as ""5thÂ Avenue Bar"", ""Emma Hartley"", and ""Death of Outlaw Billy John"" resonates in a way that doesn't exactly foster passive background listening. A great storyteller, LeBlanc draws you deep into the world he's depicting-- you can practically smell the decay - but for those few minutes there's nowhere else you'd like to be.</p>
<p>Unlike so many masters of gloom and doom, though, LeBlanc doesn't lay it on so thick as to be claustrophobic. His daguerreotype songs actually sway and breathe, and while it's easy to dismiss the familiar signifiers-- the weeping lap steel, the ghostly reverb on the vocals, the presence of Emmylou Harris doing a guest turn on backing vocals-- it's harder to dismiss LeBlanc's potential. If this is what the guy's doing just out of his teens, it's anyone guess what life further lived will evince. Whether it turns out to be a crutch or a launch platform,Â <i>Paupers Field</i> definitely paves the path forward.</p></div>"|14795.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14795-paupers-field/|6.8|Joshua Klein

<p class=""MsoNormal"">In debating the uses and wastes of war, no image carries more power than that of a mother grieving for her dead son. Two new collections of old war tunes-- one curated by the New York label Tompkins Square, the other covered by a veteran country singer-- deploy that tragic figure repeatedly, generating a gamut of emotions: from despair to anger, from outrage to honor, from schmaltz to utter devastation. But no matter if you're a lamb or a hawk, a letter in the mail can be more horrifying than a bullet or a bomb. Despite expounding very different views on war, both of these releases are timely as they bring ongoing debates about expensive wars in the Middle East into the realm of music and ground them historically and culturally. By digging so deep into the past, they reveal our present fears and concerns to be no different than those of previous generations.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>Bloody War: Songs 1924-1939</i> goes straight to the source, culling long-lost recordings from between the World Wars to showcase peacetime misgivings. This isn't Greatest Generation lionization nor Baby Boomer dissent. Instead, like so many Tompkins Square releases, it's a dizzyingly well-researched collection whose academic enterprise never dulls the impact of the music. These fifteen songs show just how deeply the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, and World War I, among other conflicts, had penetrated the American conscience, motivating and defining certain corners of popular culture the way WWII and Vietnam do today. (Tompkins Square is donating a portion of the proceeds to <a href=""http://www.iava.org"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Iraq &amp; Afghanistan Veterans of America</a>.)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">War may be hell, but it provides mighty inspiration. The music on <i>Bloody War</i> is multivaried, lively, and immediate, flexing genres and styles to make larger points about violence and bravery. ""Johnnie, Get Your Gun"", recorded by Earl Johnson &amp; His Clodhoppers in 1927, rambles with determined urgency, pushed along by the string band's precise picking and the complex sarcasm in Johnson's refrain. There is a great deal of humor in these fearful songs, especially on ""The Battleship of Maine"" by Red Patterson's Piedmont Log Rollers. ""Why are you running, are you afraid to die?"" Patterson asks. ""The reason I am running is because I cannot fly."" Just as often, however, these ruminative songs address the pain of loss more directly: The Dixon Brothers' froggy harmonies intensify the desolation of ""The Old Vacant Chair"", a Civil War tune the siblings updated to the 1930s. As one brother ghosts the other's lead vocals, the song proves an eerie, dignified prayer that perfectly illuminates the human costs of violence.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">A few of the songs on Charlie Louvin's <i>The Battles Rage On</i> reach back to the period covered by <i>Bloody War</i>, as does the man himself. Born in 1927, he and his brother Ira were playing county fairs and square dances in Alabama years before Pearl Harbor, after which Charlie enlisted in the Air Force and served during World War II and the Korean War. Those experiences motivate this covers album featuring songs by Tom T. Hall, Roy Acuff, the Statler Brothers, Merle Haggard, and even the Louvin Brothers. Some are gently anti-war, others decidedly not. ""Smoke on the Water,"" which is not a Deep Purple cover but an updated jingo jingle originally by Zeke Clements, proposes riding Hitler out on a rail and replaces Hirohito with bin Laden. It's much more complex and conflicted than some of the mainstream country war-related songs of the early 2000s (there's nothing as brash as Toby Keith's ""Courtesy of the Red, White &amp; Blue (The Angry American)"", thankfully), but <i>The Battles Rage On</i> occasionally overplays its sentiments. ""More Than a Name on a Wall"" follows a mother as she visits the Vietnam Memorial, and Louvin sings from her perspective with gentle empathy. The production subtly undermines the song, putting a soft-focus gloss on the guitar and mandolin that sounds somehow too blunt.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The second half of the album is packed with such grieving mother songs, some of them popularized by the Louvin Brothers in the 1950s. It should get predictable or manipulative, but even in his 80s, Louvin remains a steadfast interpreter, imbuing these songs with stoic pride. That approach, more than the music or the lyrics, nods to the complexity of the issue and reveals war as both horrible and necessary. That makes the closer all the more affecting: His cover of the traditional gospel ""Down by the Riverside"", with its declarative refrain ""Ain't gonna study war no more,"" is almost jubilant in its defiance. Together, <i>The Battles Rage On</i> and <i>Bloody War</i> encompass almost the entire musical and military history of the twentieth century, and their startling evocations of loss, fear, grief, bravery, cowardice, and horror are louder than bombs.</p>

Waka Flocka Flame is an unrepentant street-rap hardhead-- as much a descendant of New York aggro-thugs like DMX or Screwball as early 2000s southern club rappers. Producer Lex Luger provides most of <i>Flockaveli</i>'s thunderous accompaniment, while a parade of no-name/street-fame character-rappers (plus, inexplicably, Wale) give the album the chaotic tone of a street brawl. But at the record's violent core, Waka Flocka Flame stands as a gangsta rap giant whose lack of range is more than made up for by his grizzled bark.</p>
<p>For 17 straight tracks, <i>Flockaveli</i> is a furious torrent of gangsta rap id. There are zero attempts at crossover, no R&amp;B choruses (unless you count Roscoe Dash's rasp over Drumma Boy's ominous marching horn anthem ""No Hands""). Certain songs jump out immediately-- especially rap-anthem-of-the-year contender ""Hard in Da Paint"". ""Grove St. Party"" subverts the record's adrenaline into a cocktail of intoxicated cockiness and tense creepiness-- a dark, twisted party jam. ""For My Dawgs"" turns the record's energy into a survivalist street anthem: ""One lousy-ass bullet can't fuckin' stop me."" Waka's reckless fatalism-- that sense of him teetering on a knife's edge-- is the part of his persona that best fits with the approach of the album's Makaveli namesake.</p>
<p>But it's the sound of the album that sticks out the most at first, a sonic barrageÂ of uncontained hood aggression. The beats are confrontational, shredding up the template of early-2000s Atlanta and turning the remains into an overwhelmingly dense assault of hi-hats and gothic string pads. Along with gunfire effects and Waka's constant ad libs, these elements create a non-stop gut punch of aural adrenaline. Luger's production isn't far removed from the post-Jeezy trap sound of fellow Atlantans Shawty Redd and Drumma Boy-- in fact, he's a little less dexterous than the latter-- but it works perfectly with Waka's sledgehammer-subtle approach. His beats alternate between unrelentling repetition (""Bang"") and unexpected, lurching drop-outs (""Hard in Da Paint"").</p>
<p>But for all the credit given to Luger-- who, in fairness, has upped the bar for rap producers competing with the post-Tunnel nightclub gangster aesthetic-- it's Waka who gives this record its frenetic intensity. In gangsta rap's race to produce the hardest possible tracks, Waka seems intent on topping everyone, stripping street rap to its essential characteristics and distilling the genre into its purest form. But he's no traditionalist, either, avoiding the New York roughneck's reliance on older production styles. There are few attempts to integrate nuance or complexities, gray-scale morality, or introspection. Each track gives a new perspective on the same basic archetype, reducing gangsta rap to its building blocks: hypermasculine children of the drug trade, reckless fatalism, intensity, and physicality.</p>
<p>Anyone coming to this record expecting wordplay, or criticizing it for its lack thereof, is missing the point completely: <i>Flockaveli</i> thrives on Waka's fresh approach to the same generation gap-widening narrative that's driven street rap since before N.W.A. That doesn't mean he can't rap; instead, Waka sells on the way his personality bleeds through his vocals and phrasing, the way his voice rolls, ""I'ma die for this, shawty, I swwweartogod,"" on ""Hard in Da Paint"", imprinting his vocals in the most memorable possible way: ""Mizz-ayy management, shit, that my motherrr.""</p>
<p>Which leads to the line that explains the entire record: ""When my little brother died, I said, 'Fuck school.'"" This one lyric summarizes the attitude of a record utterly unconcerned with authority and anyone else who gets in the way. It points to the unspoken undercurrent in gangsta rap that's usually mischaracterized as undirected underclass rage: Waka's aggression is the survivalist reaction of the powerless, directed toward the threats of the immediate environment. He knows his strengths and he plays to them, exactingly.</p></div>"|14771.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14771-flockaveli/|8.0|David Drake

But should it matter that Philadelphia duo Sun Airway wrote most of these songs long before the release of <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i>? In this case, I'd say it does: A lot of current acts working in a similar vein intrigue through potential and seem to have a better grasp on how to adopt still-fresh influences than they do on songwriting. But Sun Airway invert that balance, radiating warmth instead of sounding warped by it. They've created a sturdy album of electronic pop gems that just happens to have great timing.</p>
<p>What's most immediately striking is the tone of Jon Barthmus' vocals. We've become used to a certain kind of boyish, longing yelp accompanying this sort of sound. While Barthmus employs a gleaming falsetto when the time is right, his voice has more in common with the kind of everydude croon linked with turn-of-the-century garage rock. It furthers the idea that the crisp and purposeful melodies of the landlocked road anthem ""American West"" and the endlessly corkscrewing vocal lead of ""Waiting on You"" would be every bit as potent supported by wood and string as they would by electronics. That said, <i>Nocturne</i> benefits from the compositional freedom of samplers. ""Oh, Naoko"" triangulates the swooning sustain of shoegaze, a near-dancehall riddim, and the unabashed gushing of post-Fugazi emo, all leading into a monster chorus.</p>
<p>A little less artful is ""Shared Piano"", which strips the ""Ebony and Ivory"" metaphor of its racial connotations and flips it into a brood on a disintegrating relationship. Catchy as they are, it might be a tough sell if you're not as much into mash-note lyricism, but it's heartening when a ""bedroom pop"" album acknowledges its creation space as a place for romance and not just retreat.</p>
<p>Which is why a line like, ""I wish we could be swallowed by the sky,"" is a good summation for when Sun Airway slip up-- they benefit more from economy than overload (overproduction also haunted their former band, A-Sides). Particularly during the second half, perfectly legible melodies ascend ever upward into unnecessary cumulus clouds of echo. But those are minor quibbles-- whether you think the mainstreaming of <i>Person Pitch</i> was the worst thing to happen to current indie, or you're hoping the deadbeat summer remains endless, it shouldn't apply to Sun Airway, who crafted a mature and confident collection of alternate-reality singles far less common than its sound might initially imply.</p></div>"|14780.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14780-nocturne-of-exploded-crystal-chandelier/|7.8|Ian Cohen

Over the course of her career, she has applied her quavering soprano to an impressively broad array of styles that has included rustic folk, spiky acid rock, German lieder, and a musical setting of Emily Dickinson poems. On <i>Anda Jaleo</i>, recorded live in the Grenadine Sierra with the Victor Herrero Band, she returns to more traditional material. The album features songs from poet Federico Garcia Lorca's folk collection <i>Las Canciones Populares Espanolas</i>. And for better or worse, Foster and her group have taken a conservative, almost reverential approach to this material, resulting in an album that goes exactly as far as its premise might suggest and no further.</p>
<p>As genre exercises go, however, <i>Anda Jaleo</i> is extremely well-executed. Drawing inspiration from Lorca's own 1931 recordings with the flamenco singer/dancer La Argentinita, these performances are spirited and infectious, with Foster's voice perfectly framed by the sound of acoustic guitars, castanets, handclaps, and dancing feet. The album's humble production suits her well, and on such tracks as the mournful ""Las Morillas de Jaen"" there's little to indicate that these are modern recordings rather than some antique 78-rpm discs.</p>
<p>While Garcia Lorca's work was closely informed by his friendships and collaborations with surrealists Salvador Dali, Luis Bunuel, and other contemporary modernists, his poetry was also heavily steeped in traditional Spanish culture. These traditions are directly reflected in the songs he collected for <i>Las Canciones</i>,Â whose lyrics are filled with references to Moorish girls, gypsies, bullfighters, and Spanish geography. The songbook was suppressed during Franco's dictatorship, despite the fact that the songs contain few if any overt political references. (Although during the Spanish Civil War the lyrics to songs such as ""Anda Jaleo"" were occasionally altered to reflect anti-Franco sentiment.)</p>
<p>The album's stylish package includes song lyrics in both Spanish and English translation, and though the songs may not be directly political, nearly every song in the collection seems to carry fragments of loss and mystery. Foster and Herrero prove themselves expert at mining the songbook's wealth of emotion, be it in the high-spirited drive of ""Los Cuatro Muleros"" or in the half-sung, half-spoken ""Los Mozos de Monleon"", an enigmatic tale of death in the bullring. The album is at its best during its quietest moments, as on ""Los Reyes De La Baraja"" (""The Kings of the Cards"") which is a delicate duet between Foster's voice and Herrero's exquisite acoustic guitar, or the closing a cappella lullaby ""Nana De Sevilla"".</p>
<p>As lovely as <i>Anda Jaleo</i> can sound, there are points at which one can't help but wish that the group had chosen to be more daring in their arrangements. The original recordings of Lorca and La Argentinita are still readily available and are quite worth hearing. In several instances here, the group's arrangements simply substitute acoustic guitar for Lorca's piano, resulting in performances that do little to improve upon the originals. Foster and Herrero do deserve credit for bringing further attention to Lorca's songbook, and hopefully they can find a way in the future to integrate these regional traditions into some of the other idioms that Foster has already practiced.</p></div>"|14784.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14784-anda-jaleo/|6.2|Matthew Murphy

Judging from the gentle,  whimsical tone of his music, he is also probably one of the sweetest  people in the world. The joyful music he creates, however, has  extremely limited use-- 15 minutes of his manically giddy pop  should be enough for anybody. His fifth full-length album, <i>Port Entropy</i>,  grows wearying at less than 40. Whether they are employing flutes,  woodblocks, chimes, xylophones, accordion, upright piano, or, more  likely, all of them at once, every Tokumaru song expresses the same  basic sentiment: in a word, ""YAY!!""Â <i>Port Entropy</i> is  charming and pretty and brilliantly assembled, but utterly  two-dimensional, and listening to it even one time completely through  yields strikingly diminished returns.</p>
<p>Tokumaru's albums usually make room for a sigh or two amid the cartoon  clamor. The calmest moments onÂ <i>Port Entropy </i>are the  lovely Big Star-reminiscent ballad ""Laminate"" and the plaintive singing  saw and piano of ""Linne"". Apart from those,Â <i>Port Entropy</i> isÂ  unrelentingly chipper. Tokumaru's ability to layer  dozens of tiny musical elements-- to pick just a single example, the  flute, chimes, recorder, and bird chattering on ""Lahaha""-- is  still impressive, and, in small doses, infectious. Tokumaru could  probably craft some spectacular indie film scores. Inventive sounds and  textures abound: the clanging pots-and-pans percussion on ""Tracking  Elevator"", the John Fahey-style fingerpicking of ""Straw"". But without  any room to breathe, none of these sounds are allowed to settle in and  gather meaning. When every song gallops in all directions at once, the  result is a curious kind of stasis.</p>
<p>One of a long line of sugar-rush bedroom-pop  enthusiasts-- spiritual forefather Cornelius and recent Swedish import  Loney, Dear come to mind-- the disconcerting note of insistence beneath Tokumaru's boyishness sours the atmosphere.  There is a surely an undergrad psychoanalysis paper waiting to be done  on the types of musicians who retreat to create four-track wonderlands  behind closed doors, and a trenchant conclusion to be drawn about why  their music is so often aggressively winsome. Suffice to say that  prolonged exposure to Tokumaru's flights of fancy grows tiresome at  first and then, eventually, slightly creepy.</p></div>"|14792.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14792-port-entropy/|6.2|Jayson Greene

It turned out they did have an abstract side, especially in the word-less vocals of Molly Siegel, but they were also seriously proficient musicians. Drummer Jeremy Hyman whipped up a tornado of rhythms-- he's now a go-to percussionist for the Boredoms-- and intercutting guitarists Ken Seeno and Dustin Wong were fast, complex, and precise. The brilliance of Ponytail was that all these chops served engaging music. You could dig the craft without focusing on it-- often at their shows I'd get so caught up in all the ecstatic momentum that the wizardry didn't hit me until afterwards.</p>
<p>Ponytail went on <a href=""http://www.imposemagazine.com/bytes/ponytail-break-up"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hiatus</a> in August, and Wong is the first member to release a solo record. Though his guitar prowess is more obvious on <i>Infinite Love</i>, he continues to use it primarily for emotional impact.Â A 40-minute piece cut into 15 tracks (and then re-done on a 2nd CD-- more on that later), the album was made with electric guitar, effects pedals, and a few cameos by a drum machine. Many of its passages begin like compulsory exercises, the instrumental equivalent of connecting dots, tracing lines, or winding up a toy and watching it scuttle across the floor. But they become hypnotic melodies quickly. Pin-pricks congeal into chords, loops swing into low-end waves, and strums spawn glistening notes like a sparkler emitting embers.</p>
<p>Not every Ponytail fan will be thrilled with <i>Infinite Love</i>-- even at its most engaging, it feels like an experiment. Wong encourages this a bit in his presentation-- the two CDs here are ""brother"" and ""sister"" versions which open and end the same but vary in their middles, and both include a DVD of accompanying visuals. Clearly this is not an album of songs, and its appeal will be quicker for those inclined to solo guitar explorations, or for whom repetition and layering are a form of verse-chorus-verse. But for formal-sounding guitar art, <i>Infinite Love</i> is sneakily memorable. At various points I hear echoes of Ian Williams' playing in Don Caballero, Steve Reich's phasing repetitions, the softer clouds of Mark McGuire, and hints of metal and prog-rock. Most moving is a passage of lonely balladry that sounds like Wong covering Loren Connors.</p>
<p>As diverse as all those sounds are, it would be fun to hear Wong throw off the conceptual chains and follow this album<i> </i>with looser, more unpredictable sonics-- much the way his other group, Ecstatic Sunshine, often does. Given the history he's forged with them and Ponytail, Wong likely won't sit still for long, and even the most rigid parts of <i>Infinite Love</i> suggest he's got a lot more ideas to draw on.</p></div>"|14802.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14802-infinite-love/|6.9|Marc Masters

Elverum & Sun']|2010-10-27 00:00:00|2010|2016-06-11 17:37:54.298858|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".qrrw5gffgg.1.6:0.1.0.$14776/=1$14776.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>Released in fall 2002, when Mount Eerie mastermind Phil Elverum was still calling himself the Microphones, the first <i>Song Islands</i> singles collection has proven a sort of signpost in Elverum's vast sonic journey. Breaking from the dense, craggy, world-beating noise-folk that marked his LPs-- particularly the toweringÂ <i>The Glow Pt. 2</i>-- <i>Song Islands</i> was an unusually naked affair that offered new insights into the makings of an Elverum production while, at its best, frequently pulling the focus squarely on the songs rather than their embellishments. The LPs that would follow <i>Song Islands</i>-- the impossibly huge <i>Mount Eerie</i>, the lopsided <i>No Flashlight</i>-- failed to reach the heights of Elverum's earlier work, and he seemed to retreat further into his art, issuing numerous singles and EPs, exploring genres, and releasing lavish coffee-table books with records that often felt secondary. The proliferation of individual pieces-- often with similar names, typically attached to curious-on-paper concepts-- has made it a near impossibility to keep up with Elverum, more creatively restless than ever. We needed an overview.</p>
<p>Instead, we're presented with another volume of <i>Song Islands</i>:Â Thirty-some tracks, primarily unreleased, covering everything from raw alternate takes of recent works to wormy 1970s AM pop castoffs. It's a lot to take in, as a retrospective of such a monstrous catalog ought to be. But the territory <i>Song Islands Vol. 2</i> attempts to chart is simply too  vast-- nearly a decade's worth of diversions-- to cover in 80 minutes'  time. The nature-kid proselytizing, the scabrous drums and stalactite  guitars, the existential anguish-- it's all here. But Elverum's always  at his best when the songs feel sewn into their surroundings; the songs  from <i>Song Islands 2</i> seem plucked piecemeal from the archives, divorced  from the bursts of inspiration that birthed them. Elverum's refusal to  sit still these past few years has resulted in some breathktaking music,  no doubt, but laid out like this, it also makes for a scattershot  listen</p>
<p>We begin with ""Where?"", a scene-setting bit of folk that immediately lays out Elverum's post-<i>Glow 2</i> identity crisis: ""Mount Eerie is nowhere/ Mount Eerie is playing tonight."" From there, <i>Song Islands</i> slips into the Carpenters homage of ""Calf in Pasture"" (less grim than it sounds), the percussive drone of ""The Intimacy"", then the more typical Elverum wayfarer ""I Whale"". Each has its charms, but due to their clipped construction-- most songs hover around the two-minute mark-- and the record's pacing-averse genre-hopping,Â <i>Song Islands</i> never establishes the internal rhythms and deliberate dynamic shifts that mark his best work. There's little apparent order to the tracklist; a chronological sequence might've explained the odd pacing and would've offered up a little more insight into Elverum's evolution over the last several years, but these tunes almost seem picked out of a hat. It's hardly a best-of; the tender, searching ""Wooly Mammoth's Mighty Absence"", certainly on anyone's shortlist for the single best Elverum song in a decade, is conspicuously AWOL, making room for directionless ambient interludes (""Heart Lake at Night""), sketchbook remnants (""Voices in Headphones [Singers]"") and half-formed, heart-on-sleeve strums (take your pick).  Roughhewn tone pieces sit next to barren folk laments, only occasionally meeting in the middle; his sonic palette, one of the richest in indie rock, often feels pared down to a few basic elements, and while <i>Song Islands 2</i> covers a great deal of ground, rarely do these songs reach the hushed intimacy or thunderous calamity of Elverum's more elaborate productions.</p>
<p>""In Moonlight"" gets it right, moving from a meandering solo Phil to a powerful, sweeping crescendo; it's one of the few numbers here that feels more like a proper song than a thumbnail sketch. ""Get Off the Internet"" may be cloying-- whether it's imploring you to take out the garbage or doing it to the tune of ""We Are the World""-- but it's at least memorable. And Elverum's still quick with a well-placed Waldenism that'll cut you to the core; ""when was the last time you touched a leaf?,"" he asks, and you'll keep wondering about. But, caught up amongst the flotsam of <i>Song Islands 2</i>, moments like these are far too fleeting.</p></div>"|14776.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14776-song-islands-vol-2/|5.6|Paul Thompson

It would have been the band's first since 1982'sÂ <i>Avalon</i>, and there even seems to be a sly nod to that two-decade gap on album opener ""You Can Dance"", which opens with a brief musical passage that is pretty much a note-for-note reference to <i><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Avalon</span></i>'s ""True to Life"". Somewhere in the process, though, this became another Bryan Ferry solo album, featuring original Roxy Music members Andy Mackay, Phil Manzanera, and Brian Eno, and Ferry brought in a raft of collaborators, some old, some new, to round out the record, his first to feature original songs since 2002's <i>Frantic</i>.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, if Roxy Music had released this exact album in 1983 as a follow-up to <i>Avalon</i>, I don't think anyone would have batted an eye. It spills over with the aesthetics and sounds of Ferry's 80s work, which has the strange effect of also making it sound very current. The synths, fluid beats, wiry guitar parts with just a bit of chorus, and electric pianos are all things you can hear on any number of indie rock records today. Ferry puts them together in a very classic rock way, residing at the center as the charismatic front man. The FM-rock approach to the emphasis on vocals is mirrored in the lead guitar contributed by Manzanera and Pink Floyd's David Gilmour-- that kind of playing is one of the few elements of 80s album rock that hasn't made a significant comeback, which may partly be down to the proficiency it requires.</p>
<p>The first half of the album is as solid as anything Ferry has done under his own name. ""You Can Dance"" and ""Alphaville"" have their roots in a late-90s session that ultimately produced about half of <i>Frantic</i>, and they're both very centered on grooves. ""You Can Dance"" grinds along on a creeping bass line and heavy drumming, guitars hovering in the wings as Ferry underplays his signature vocal quaver. ""Alphaville"" is more slippery, cut through with nicely phrased lead guitar by Gilmour, and it's  good pivot to one of the album's standouts, ""Heartache By Numbers"". The song features the Scissor Sisters as backing band, and their studied grasp of disco and New Wave suits Ferry well-- the echoing piano intro is almost cheeky in its easy anthemic fluency, but it's very much of a piece with the singer's classic songs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Elsewhere, Ferry indulges in a couple of covers; one is a completely disposable take on Traffic's ""No Face, No Name and No Number"", but the other is a pretty stunning transformation of Tim Buckley's epochal ""Song to the Siren"" into a sweeping, synth-soaked pop ballad. Ferry has always been fond of interpreting others' songs on his albums, and like his very best covers in the past, this one reveals a real connection to the song. The album does falter a bit in its second half--""BF Bass"" just has a sort of generic fashion-rock sheen, aiming for something high-class and hitting something more like the oddly sterile cover image of Kate Moss, which basically looks like a perfume ad. Still, it's a good album,Â and without the pressure of making it under the Roxy Music name, Ferry has made a confident and remarkably <span style=""font-style: normal;"">fresh-sounding record simply by doing what he's done best for over three decades</span>.</p>

On their debut,Â <i>Connected</i>, it was that rapper Phonte and producer Nicolay constructed their tracks through back-and-forth Internet correspondence, having never met by the time their album was released. With their follow-up, <i>Leave It All Behind</i>, it was that the group had committed a total about-face, Phonte having traded rapping for singing. In both cases, the results of such improbable experiments were astonishing. But unlike <i>Connected</i>, which seemed to lose steam with time, <i>Leave It All Behind</i> had a different trajectory. That album grew only richer and more impressive as the years passed, revealing itself to be a remarkably complex, mature R&amp;B record.</p>
<p>Now there's a third Foreign Exchange album, <i>Authenticity</i>-- but this time, there's no gimmick. What's more,Â it is about as far from ""cool"" or ""edgy"" as any music can be: It's an adult contemporary record that is actuallyÂ musically and emotionally sophisticated in the vein of Van Morrison, Paul Simon, Peter Gabriel, and Everything But the Girl.Â If there's anything yoking these artists to one another, it's <i>adulthood</i>-- not just in the aural placidity but also a lyrical fixation on the politics of relationships. As with <i>Leave It All Behind</i>, this topical concern is very much intact. But musically, this is a much more refined album.  <i>Leave It All Behind</i> insinuated a break-up-- if not one that's already happened, then one that's just on the horizon; <i>Authenticity</i> is undoubtedly the aftermath.</p>
<p>Nicolay has successfully synthesized the polished, straightforward constructs ofÂ <i>Connected</i> with the labyrinthine soul arrangements of <i>Leave It All Behind</i>. The music on <i>Authenticity</i> may initially sound remedial and elemental, even saccharine, but further listens reveal new intricacies.Â What kept pulling me back in was the album's final track, the somehow elliptical and conclusive ""This City Ain't the Same Without You"". Over a trickling keyboard pattern and a breezy guitar strum, Phonte and guest YahZarah echo the song's title into the ether with a lingering hook. It urged me to keep revisiting the album, and each time around, another song would stand out, until I soon began to admire all of them. But as with all albums possessing this level of depth and detail, that's how this kind of thing works. At a brisk 40 minutes, <i>Authenticity</i> reaffirms that sense of accomplishment, cementing the Foreign Exchange as one of the artists at the forefront of contemporary R&amp;B's avant-garde.</p></div>"|14781.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14781-authenticity/|7.6|Tal Rosenberg

Part of that has to do with how difficult it is to describe his music, an ambiguous form of electronic dance where texture varies greatly from one sound to the next. In his world, if a reverbed guitar echoes overhead, then perhaps the hectic clickity-clack of skittering drums will offset it, rapidly stapling it down. And each sound in an Apparat track seems like it was created using different tools, so that guitar strain might reflect the smoothness and shine of silk while each of those percussive instruments sounds like a completely different kind of metal was used to sculpt it. Since Apparat has such a wide array of textures at his disposal, his possibilities for a mix seem vast.</p>
<p>Of the three 2010 <i>DJ-Kicks</i> mixes prior to this one-- Juan MacLean, Kode9, and James Holden-- Apparat's most resembles the latter. Where MacLean blurred distinctions between house music old and new and Kode9 tried to pack as many funky/dubstep records into a small space, Holden went a different route: He took a number of disparate records and tried to make them resemble his own aesthetic. MacLean and Kode9 were selecting and mixing tracks in order to make a banging mix; Holden was selecting and mixing tracks to make a banging album. Likewise, Apparat digs through his collection in an attempt to make an Apparat-sounding album out of other people's music. Though in so doing, he shows his cards a bit, suggesting that his sound could be loosely categorized as one where experimental electronic music edges further into indie territory.</p>
<p>Between Holden's and Apparat's <i>DJ-Kicks</i>, Holden's gets the edge, and it's not even because he selects better tracks. Ultimately, Holden is the better sequencer, with a stronger understanding of the rhythm and pacing of a mix. Apparat finds his groove during a stretch in the middle beginning with Four Tet's remix of Born Ruffians' ""I Need a Life"" and ending at Vincent Markowski's ""The Madness of Moths"", possibly the best patch on any of the four <i>DJ-Kicks</i> this year, but there's a lack of a defined arc over the course of these 24 songs. When Thom Yorke's ""Harrowdown Hill"" appears near the end, its placement feels odd and disjunctive, as if your roommate came in and decided to drag one of his favorite songs into a playlist you spent hours making.</p>
<p>That's a shame, because Apparat does have a knack for conveying his aesthetic through other people's music, especially when he blends two records that shouldn't work together but do. It's most indicative here when the chirrup of small, echoed percussion on Phon.o's ""Intervall"" peppers the muffled sadness of Burial and Four Tet's ""Moth"", enhancing an already smoldering track. And the way Apparat mixes his exclusive <i>DJ-Kicks</i> track, the operatic techno of ""Sayulita"", is similarly representative of this skill. Arriving just after the dryly funky dubstep of Joy Orbison's ""The Shrew Would Have Cushioned the Blow"" and a couple tracks before the expansive ambience of the closing track, Tim Hecker's ""Borderlands"", Apparat demonstrates how his exacting attention to detail unites him with artists from all over electronic music's terrain.</p></div>"|14794.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14794-dj-kicks/|7.2|Tal Rosenberg

If nothing else, unlikely Swedish pop star Annika Norlin is a very good writer. Her albums as Hello Saferide, both 2005's <i>Introducing</i>... and 2008's tellingly named <i>More Modern Short Stories From Hello Saferide, </i>demonstrate an unusual aptitude for pitch-perfect fictions. Norlin finds the sublime in everyday life and shows strength by being unafraid to bare weakness. Her first Swedish-language album as SÃ¤kert!, an eponymous 2007 release of homespun indie pop, went gold in her native country and won two Swedish Grammis, including an award for lyricist of the year.</p>
<p>Norlin returns to the Swedish language on her second SÃ¤kert! album, and once again her songwriting deserves to transcend cultural boundaries. Musically, <i>Facit</i> is more richly arranged than its predecessor, but also darker, with minor chords even among the fast songs. Henrik Oja, who again produces and now also gets co-writing credit, can count free jazz among his recent work; here he favors a dusky, approachable jangle that puts the focus on Norlin's conversational vocals. So sooner or later you're going to have to try to understand what she's singing about, whether a holy misfit with the same first name as the prime minister, a young rebel who reminds the narrator of her own faded idealism, or an insecure woman who can't help but go back to a former lover, like Liz Lemon returning to loser boyfriend Dennis Duffy in old episodes of ""30 Rock"". Non-Swedish phrases jump out here and there: Rosa Parks, <i>Lonely Planet</i>, Rotary. If you can watch <i>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</i> with subtitles, then you can wring a whole lot of enjoyment out of <i>Facit</i>, but it sure helps to follow along by mousing over the lyrics in Google Translate.</p>
<p>It turns out there's a wedding song, ""Dansa, fastÃ¤n"", where horns, handclaps, and Daniel Berglund's subtle drumming nicely frame Norlin's romantic disillusionment. There's a funeral song, ""NÃ¤r du dÃ¶r"", where a whispery Norlin imagines a dead lover turning into a tree, so future generations can meet him, or else that tree getting cut down to make paper, in which case she'd write letters with pen again-- she'd write poetry. And best of all, there's an unrequited-love song, ""FÃ¥r jag"", where a couple go to a Stockholm bar called Dovas, watch hockey on TV without watching hockey, and lean in close to each other right when the score reaches 2-0 versus Finland: a stomach-tingling moment that, like the inland simplicity to which it hearkens, is doomed not to last. There was a minor Swedish media frenzy this summer after a magazine  reported that Norlin would be quitting music. She has since dismissed  such rumors, but <i>Facit</i> makes it easy to see why people might want  to believe them. Although obviously crafted with great care, the songs  here feel tremendously naked and transparent, even to someone who  doesn't speak the language.</p></div>"|14783.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14783-facit/|7.6|Marc Hogan

But seen live there's no mistaking that they're a great <i>rock</i> band of a really traditional sort, even when they're performing not-very-traditional rock songs. They bring an instrument-walloping, body-tossing intensity to their gigs, the kind of abandon that makes it hard to just sit back and check your Twitter feed. Even when the rhythms get delicate and the guitars get dreamy, when the music turns more art-rock than art-punk, there's a certain slightly mocking theatrical grandeur to the band's delivery. They understand that an audience, who could just as easily be listening to this spacey stuff while sacked out on the couch at home, needs to be entertained.</p>
<p><i>Live at Sheperds Bush Empire</i> is a decent if slightly compromised approximation of the Liars-in-concert experience. The minus side is that there's some energy invariably lost when you can't see frontman Angus Andrew bounding across the stage like a lanky shaman and so on. The plus side is that you can still hear the band attacking their songs with an intensity you get only intermittently on their albums. Liars' always shroud their records in a layer of grotty industrial ambiance, and so it's not surprising that <i>Shepherds Bush</i> doesn't actually sound all that different, fidelity-wise, from your standard Liars studio release. What's different is that, faced with a roomful of bodies, Liars can't (or won't) pull their punches. Here we get Liars the avant-garage band, turning murky Krautrock-inspired jams into tribal sing-alongs (""Proud Evolution"") or playing with the joyful fury of a basement-show punk band (""The Overachievers""). ""Fun"" isn't a word that crops up when discussing a band as into eeriness and discomfort as Liars, but this is about as fun (you know, like a rock record) as their records are likely to get, a punchy memento for fans between tours.</p>
<p>Half of the <i>Proud Evolution</i> EP--  the title track, a Thom Yorke remix, and a live take-- will be a non-issue for anyone who owns <i>Sisterworld</i>, the <i>Sisterworld Reinterpretations</i> remix album, and/or <i>Live at Shepherds Bush</i>. The new half showcases what Liars do best offstage: 21st century post-punk that's all hypnotic rhythm, goosebump-inducing noise, and Andrew's unnerving vocals, which alternate between pained moaning and even more pained keening. It's drifting, droning, dark stuff, much better suited to a 2 a.m. bedroom listening than a cramped club. There's always been a goth side to Liars-- you thought it was an accident there are live covers of the band doing Bauhaus on YouTube?-- but here they crank it to the max. Except this is goth with any campy hysteria stripped away until all that's left is an insistent, unshakable sense of dread. Plenty of bands make music for your Halloween party.

Beck actually shows up on <i>Orange</i>, literally phoning in a guest verse on ""Flavor"", and they toured with the Beasties soon after. It's easy to hear what those guys liked in the band's assault. The Blues Explosion were honest, organic experimenters-- fusing tons of different styles into their musical assault without compromising their ferocity or making any of it sound forced. These influences are fully internalized, rather than self-consciously stapled on. So we get Isaac Hayes disco strings on the drawn-out ""Bellbottoms"" intro, feral James Chance-sounding sax squawks on ""Ditch"", Meters/Booker T organ grease on ""Very Rare"", g-funk keyboard whine on ""Greyhound"". But we also get a scuzzed-up, pigfuck-descended rock band working at the absolute peak of its considerable powers.</p>
<p>On <i>Orange</i>, everything falls into place like it never had before and never would again. The band's gnarled, borderline-cartoonish gutbucket roots are proudly on display, and its delirious self-glorifying goes way further than it had before. (As the liner notes of this new reissue point out, Spencer didn't yell out ""Blues Explosion!"" too often on Blues Explosion songs pre-<i>Orange</i>. Here, he yells it <i>constantly</i>.) But most of the greatest moments on the album aren't the go-for-broke blasts of adrenaline; they're the points where the band pulls back and sticks to the pocket. It's a bit of a surprise to learn, via the newly fleshed-out liner notes, that the band was in a pretty dysfunctional and drugged-out state at the time they recorded it. Guitarist Judah Bauer floats the theory that he might've played behind the beat throughout the album because he was ""junk sick."" Instead, onÂ <i>Orange</i>, these three guys sound able to anticipate each other's moves way ahead of time. The tracks groove hard, and every change feels totally intuitive.</p>
<p>Only a couple of songs on <i>Orange</i> have what could even loosely be considered choruses. Spencer is the unquestioned frontman here, but his vocals are more hypeman exhortation than actual song. A few instrumentals turn up, and all the songs could really work without Spencer's vocals, fun as it is to hear him whoop out the names of different cities or scream about how much his wife likes to fuck. Even with all the smart, well-placed studio embellishments here, this feels like an excerpted version of a long, on-fire jam session. Spencer and Bauer pile on layer after layer of stomp-riff, while Russell Simins' drumming is a natural wonder: an absurdly funky push-pull with some of the thundercrack heaviness of John Bonham. Next to the spidery, introverted indie rock of its day, <i>Orange</i> sounded like a revelation-- an absurd burst of swagger and libido, as rendered by three total expert musicians. Even Beck sounds a bit taken aback when Spencer starts wailing, ""You got the flavor!"" at him after he gets done laying his verse. The thing sold 100,000 copies, and yet it didn't really go on to influence anyone, possibly because nobody else could do it like this.</p>
<p>This new blown-out reissue of <i>Orange</i> comes with a ton of extra material, none of which rivals the original album's power. In fact, the various outtakes and extra tracks really reinforce how well-sequenced and pared-down the final album actually was. These guys knew when they'd done something special, and they knew when something didn't quite measure up. So a lot of this extra stuff is fun, but none of it is actually necessary. And some of it is straight-up dogshit; I challenge anyone to make it through the 15-minute found-sound collage ""Tour Dairy"" even once before skipping past. But the reissue is still worthy of your attention, since it includes the 1995 EP <i>Experimental Remixes</i>, which cashed in on the band's newfound cachet by getting guys like Mike D and Beck to amp up the dusty breakbeak-funk elements of these tracks. Moby's take on ""Greyhound"" is a sleek, streamlined synth-rock thing, an early attempt at the glacial pop majesty he'd find with a song like ""Southside"" a few years later, while GZA turns the same song into grimy paranoia and offers the world the rare opportunity to hear someone say, ""Killah Priest was born in a pillar of yeast, lost in the miscarriage,"" on a goddam Blues Explosion song.</p>
<p><i>Orange</i> is the smoking hole at the center of the Blues Explosion discography. Every album that came after, in one way or another, felt like a reaction to it. <i>Now I Got Worry</i> was the dark hangover after the all-night party, <i>Acme</i> the attempt to push the LP's experimental side even further, <i>Plastic Fang</i> the retrenchment into pre-<i>Orange</i> garage-rock squall. <i>Orange</i> was a one-producer affair, whereas <i>Acme</i> ropes in an unlikely coalition that includes Steve Albini, Calvin Johnson, and Automator. And even though it succeeds in giving extra dimension to the band's hip-hop side, it feels like a big step back from the tersely funky force of the two preceding records. It's a bit of a slapdash mess-- a fiery band getting lost in the margins and, to some extent, losing their way.</p>
<p>On nearly half the album, they sound as great as ever. ""Magical Colors"" is a slow, soul-inflected swell, and it indicates that the band might've kept its hot streak going a lot longer if they'd dialed the adrenaline way back on this one and gone for slinky instead. ""Do You Wanna Get Heavy?"" is a loose, sidelong drunken ramble with an insanely catchy chorus that suddenly turns the song into doo-wop. ""I Wanna Make It All Right"" is as righteously funky as the band ever got. But the songs don't build and retract the way they did on <i>Orange</i> and <i>Now I Got Worry</i>. Instead, they smush into each other with no sense of reason or progression. The choice of Automator as a collaborator is pretty interesting, but it's also a fairly entry-level rap choice for a rock band working at the time. If they'd instead linked up with, say, Pete Rock or Organized Noize, we could be looking at an absolute classic here. Meanwhile, much of the Calvin Johnson material was recorded for the stopgap side-project record <i>Dub Narcotic Sound System Meets the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion in a Dancehall Style!</i>, and much of it should've stayed there. And sometimes, we get that distracting barrage of new directions within the songs themselves. The album-closing ""Attack"", for instance, finds the band at the three-way intersection of Albini, Automator, and Atari Teeage Riot's Alec Empire, and it's exactly the flaming car wreck you'd expect.</p>
<p>Since <i>Acme</i> is so scattered and unfocused, the expanded 2xCD reissue doesn't dip in quality once the original album ends, as the <i>Orange</i> set does. So here we get two CDs' worth of a great band in decent but frustratingly scattershot form-- not bad, then, but no place to start.</p></div>"|14763.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14763-orange-acme/|8.6|Tom Breihan

""Imagine being able to be magically whisked away to... Delaware... I'm in Delaware."" Well it's that same locale that hypnogogic Brooklyn indie poppers Small Black traveled to get started on their debut LP, <i>New Chain</i>. It's actually less of a headscratcher than you think. Recorded in suburban seclusion in the First State, Small Black selected the location in hopes to try and tap back into the kind of motifs that their self-titled debut EP established-- nostalgia and dream-drunk melancholy chiefly among them. Unlike that ultra-personal, demo-quality introduction, <i>New Chain</i> marks the unveiling of a cleaner, more direct sound, thanks to the now-cemented four-piece lineup and improved production.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that that the band has shed the woozy, new wave vibe that got them lumped in with chillwave in the first place. <i>New Chain</i> doesn't make much of an attempt to skirt those signifiers, focusing more on electronics and rhythm. Most of the songs-- several of which could be classified as straight-up ballads-- are very simply constructed, relying on details to elicit feeling through a myriad of synth textures and vocal layers. There's a pretty simple equation that can be applied: The more compelling the details are, the more compelling the song is. The syrupy funk lurch of ""Goons"", those lava lamp bell tones on ""Photojournalist"", the bouncy drum programming on ""Crisp 100s""-- all are elements that elevate these very patient pop songs and make them memorable.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's synthesized almost seamlessly. ""New Chain"" is both drowsy and insular, but a subtle, muted boogie and Josh Kolenik's vocal melody help lodge it into your head in ways that a flat track like the tryingly plain ""Light Curse"" can't. Small Black are often at their best when they can either make you move or get you to feel or remember something-- it's no wonder why ""Despicable Dogs"", a single from that first EP that managed to do both, is their most beloved. ""New Chain"", with it's gorgeous smattering of vivid synth patterns, is ""Despicable Dogs"" reupholstered: It still feels like a sunrise bike ride with a head full of weed, but this time in full-blown technicolor.</p></div>"|14790.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14790-new-chain/|7.2|Zach Kelly

""I ain't never had one before."" He's sort of right. <i>Sweet James Jones Stories</i>, his official debut, was a cobbled-together collection released while Pimp served out a prison sentence. <i>Pimpalation</i>, the follow-up, actually came out while Pimp was alive and free, but, obviously enough, the man conceived it as a compilation-- a way for Pimp to showcase himself among all the artists and producers in his expanded circle, rather than a stand-alone statement. And sadly enough, it's impossible to tell how much of <i>The Naked Soul </i>is the real solo debut that Pimp wanted to release.</p>
<p>Pimp's been dead for nearly three years, a casualty of some combination of unprescribed prescription cough syrup and sleep apnea. Plenty of the material on the album sounds like it dates back to the era just before Pimp died, as his duo UGK roared back to life with the triumphant double album <i>Underground Kingz</i>. Other tracks could've been finished only later-- after Pimp's death. One of the album's guests, the onetime Pimp protÃ©gÃ©Â Lil Boosie, has been in prison, facing murder charges, for about a year now. Another, Drake, has really had a career only in the years following Pimp's death; even though Drake calls himself ""an honorary resident of UGK-town,"" I'm not even sure the two ever met. (And given Pimp's outspoken views on sensitive R&amp;B types like Ne-Yo, it's easy to imagine Pimp mercilessly mocking Drake in public if their careers had had a chance to overlap.) Parts of the record, like the regrettable Jazze Pha collab ""Fly Lady"", feel like chintzy time-capsule artifacts from a forgotten 2007. Others have the sad air of a posthumous Tupac album-- left-behind sketches of freestyle verses, given new music and preserved only because the man isn't still around to improve on them. Like every other Pimp C solo album, this isn't really an album; it's just a bunch of tracks thrown together.</p>
<p>That's a lost opportunity because Pimp C knew how to put albums together. As half of UGK, he produced some truly dazzling Southern rap full-lengths-- giving plenty of room to his blues and soul and swamp-funk influences without ever letting them overwhelm his thunderous low-end thump, helping to establish the blueprint for 90s Southern rap in the process. As a vocalist, he was also the duo's emotional core, singing choruses in a strutting, pinched falsetto and sneering his verses in a thick, arrogant twang while partner Bun B played the wise and precise elder to his unreformed knucklehead character. Pimp himself didn't produce a single track on <i>The Naked Soul</i>, so we only get to hear a part of what made him great. But that overwhelming swagger remains very much on display here.</p>
<p>Pimp's rapping here covers a pretty narrow spectrum; he spends most of his time talking about either sex or jewelry. And if you're not into the idea of a song in which Pimp and Too $hort explain to you, at some length, why you have a vagina, you should probably stay away. But Pimp played up his player archetype perfectly, and it's still fun to hear him lay out juicy, borderline-disgusting come-ons in that elongated leer of his. More than any rapper this side of Ol' Dirty Bastard, Pimp took absurd delight in the squelchy, squeaky details of sex, and he was absolutely unafraid to sound gross. So: ""We got to the beach, the ground was so sandy/ Bitches on my dick like ants on candy."" Or: ""Suck ya toes, I'm gonna shrimp tonight/ My dick make you weak like kryptonite."" Objectionable as it may be, this stuff is always fun to hear.</p>
<p>But fun or no, the album mostly just makes me sad. There can be only so many unreleased Pimp tracks, so many chances to hear that voice on a new song. And only a few tracks here belong anywhere near Pimp's pantheon. ""Since the 90s"" features cheap, twinkling horror-movie keyboards; Pimp didn't rap on tracks like that too often, but he always sounded great on them, and an on-fire E-40 guest verse only seals the deal. ""Hit the Parking Lot"" is a rumbling slick-talk session with little buddies Webbie and Lil Boosie both operating at peak capacity and Pimp schooling them both. And ""Massacre"" is just a dinky instrumental, no chorus, Pimp issuing guttural threats for five minutes. Really, that was all he ever needed to do. An hour of that would work a lot better than the patched-together succession of guest-verses and lost verses we get here.</p></div>"|14787.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14787-the-naked-soul-of-sweet-jones/|6.4|Tom Breihan

Her snowflake-delicate folk songs are composed of one or two acoustic instruments, her high, trilling voice, and nothing else. She sings almost entirely in Icelandic, which casts its own peculiar spell-- there are no turns of phrase to puzzle over, nothing to separate from the serene whole. Her new album, <i>Innundir Skinni</i>, is fuller-sounding than <i>ViÃ° Og ViÃ°</i>, but its pleasures are just as elusive and profound. Like Joanna Newsom's <i>Have One on Me</i>, it is a rich and musically complex experience that evaporates into the ether if you let it. It is impossible not be charmed by Arnalds' music, but loving it takes focus.</p>
<p><i>ViÃ° Og ViÃ°</i> was structured almost entirely around Arnald's finger-picked acoustic guitar, but <i>Innundir Skinni</i> includes a bustling menagerie of folk instruments, from the South American charango to the stroh violin, a thin, whiny horn-violin hybrid. None of them share the stage all at once, however; they creep in quietly, one by one, from the side, making little pinpricks in the songs' texture before gliding away. Arnalds seems to be freely borrowing what she loves about other cultures (Chinese music on ""Vinkonur"", fado on ""Madrid"", Celtic reels on ""Jonathan"") to create something indigenous only to herself. There are lots of lovely surprises as a result-- the little ""too rah loo rah lay"" chant on ""Jonathan"", the spaghetti-western horns that intrude on the group singalong ""Vinur Minn""-- even if you have to lean in close to register them.</p>
<p><i>Innundir Skinni</i> also includes Arnalds' first-ever English-language songs. ""Crazy Car"" is a disarming plea to a musician friend not to seek her fortunes in America-- ""Don't go in the crazy car,"" Arnalds sings lightly, over and over again, to a melody that twirls like a child's mobile. ""Surrender"" is the dark inverse-- a hypnotic song that features BjÃ¶rk on moaning background vocals. The lyrics are incantatory and difficult to make out, but the floating phrases that surface (""I carry you/ I nurture you/ Give birth to you"") and the circular melody worm their way under your skin nonetheless. Incidentally, this is what the titleÂ <i>Innundir Skinni</i> translates to loosely in English-- ""under the skin""-- an apt description for Arnalds' gentle, peculiar and powerful music itself.</p></div>"|14788.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14788-innundir-skinni/|8.0|Jayson Greene

And indeed, in terms of both general mood and sound, <i>Down There</i> is among the darkest pieces of music to emerge from a member of Animal Collective. The images of the crocodile on the album's cover and in promotional photos hint at the swampy vibe, but the animal association could be extended further: You can almost see Portner's head barely above water, not exactly drowning but having a hard time holding on regardless.</p>
<p>Produced by fellow A.C. member Josh Dibb, the marshland sonics of <i>Down There</i> feel related to the smeared, strung-out electric confusion of Animal Collective's 2005 album,Â <i>Feels</i>. But to think too much about the past would be to ignore the album's distinct rhythmic tics. While Animal Collective's 2009 breakthrough LP, <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i>, was notable for its big, buzzy beats, here the pulse is more introverted and irregular. So we get the clicking dub of ""Ghost of Books"" and the Warp-like IDM textures of ""Heads Hammock"". The clatter of ""Lucky 1"" is panicked and freaked-out, while the straightforward pulse of ""Oliver Twist"" smacks distantly like the remnants of a pounding headache. The rhythms are prominent, but they don't exactly seem designed for dancing.</p>
<p><i>Down There</i> is less accessible than latter-day Animal Collective and harder to wrap your head around, but it isn't a callback to the more difficult sound that marked the band early on. If anything, it sounds like Portner is taking a lateral step away from Animal Collective in order to work out some pressing personal issues on his own. This sense of retreat, coupled with the internally focused, claustrophobic atmosphere, brings to mind the thematic concerns (if certainly not the sound) of Neil Young's 1974 bummed-out classic <i>On the Beach</i>. But unlike Neil, Portner doesn't seem angry at the outside world. He's asking questions of himself, and it seems he's doing so without expecting any easy answers. ""Shouldn't I be content with what I got?"" he muses in ""Oliver Twist"", later wondering if ""I'm just a thief.""</p>
<p><i>Down There</i> opener ""Laughing Hieroglyphic"" finds Portner touching on notions of protection and kinship, ideas common to the work of his bandmate Panda Bear's solo work. But here, there's less hope and more personal questioning: ""When I get fucked up/ I do the best/ To make myself not fucked up again/ My heart and my lungs do/ Why can't I do the same for everyone I love too?"" Malaise overcomes Portner in ""Heads Hammock"", as the phrase ""I don't want to"" goes unfinished, swallowed up by echoed gurgles. ""Heather in the Hospital"", which addresses his sister's bout with cancer, ditches internal narrative almost entirely, using emergency room imagery (""The people bandaged up/ The doctor's making rounds"") as emotional armor from that beatific, bluesy shout that runs through the song. The music and lyrics here are cut from the same downcast cloth.</p>
<p>Portner has said that he has no plans to perform this material live, hinting that the feeling of the music isn't something that he wants to revisit every night on tour. And it's true that <i>Down There</i> embodies a mindset that most people are trying to get away from. But there's a fantastical bent to the album that opens up with repeated listening, the dripping, moist ""weird hell"" vibe that Portner's mentioned in several interviews since. The album's theme of the underworld reveals itself in the beginning of the stately instrumental ""Glass Bottom Boat"", where one warped voice asks another, ""Hey, do you know how to get to that cemetery?"" and receives the reply, ""Sure, I can get you there. Just step into my boat here."" The exchange brings to mind Charon, the Greek mythological figure that ferried souls across the rivers Styx and Acheron and into the deeper recesses of Hades. Portner's on that same boat later on during <i>Down There</i>'s standout ""Cemeteries"", his voice reverberating off the reflecting pool of the hushed production: ""Looking back on/ Old days"". Throughout the record, the vogue for nostalgia that permeates so much modern indie gets inverted. Sometimes, this record says, the past is better left behind.</p></div>"|14764.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14764-down-there/|7.9|Larry Fitzmaurice

What constitutes ""normal"" for Wyatt is this: He was a titan of the Canterbury prog-rock scene in the 1960s before turning to jazz and experimental idioms, though he also had a big single in the 70s with a cover of the Monkees' ""I'm a Believer"". He's equally hard to pigeonhole via his diverse collaborators,Â including Brian Eno, Ryuichi Sakamoto, David Gilmour, Max Richter, BjÃ¶rk, and Hot Chip. Wyatt freaks us out because he seems too chimerical and free for this age, with its mania for classification. He's a traditionalist who hears with weird ears.</p>
<p>His latest album, a collaboration with the saxophonist Gilad Atzmon and the violinist Ros Stephen, is again evasive, seeming at once defiantly old-fashioned and defiantly quirky. The trio, backed by Stephen's Sigamos String Quartet, brushes the mothballs off a variety of jazz standards, from David Raskin and Johnny Mercer's weepy ""Laura"" to the Louis Armstrong chestnut ""What a Wonderful World"", and checks in at ""Lush Life"", ""In a Sentimental Mood"", and ""Round Midnight"" along the way. But the record also features Palestinian rapping, screwy remakes of old Wyatt songs, and Wyatt's second stab at Chic's ""At Last I Am Free"". The mood is elegiac yet playful, with Wyatt's advancing age and bulletproof stature creating an impression of ease, not to mention a welcome indifference to popular trends.</p>
<p>The fine musicianship does justice to the standards. The coarse wool of Wyatt's voice plays well against the strings, and Atzmon's alto sax injects some glossier colors. His style here blends bebop virtuosity and Middle Eastern sinuosity. In most cases, there is something pleasingly ""off"" or new about the standards. ""Laura"" has seldom sounded so understated and ghostly, and it plays wonderfully beside the original ""Lullaby for Irena"", an incorporeal love song. On ""Round Midnight"", the piano melody is transcribed to strings, and a lonesome whistle stands in for the vocal melody, drawing its wistfulness into surprising clarity. Shades of radio crackle drift through the patient, noodling ""In a Sentimental Mood"". Only the tranquil and straight-faced take on ""What a Wonderful World"" that closes the album seems untouched by a light, impish subversion.</p>
<p>But for all of its nostalgic comforts, <i>For the Ghosts Within</i> is also aÂ protest record. Atzmon, an Israeli-born British citizen, is a notable anti-Zionist writer and activist. On the title track, his sax yodels like a muezzin calling the faithful to prayer, and the lyrics by Wyatt's wife Alfreda Benge are unmistakable in their sympathies: ""We're still here, under the olive trees/ When will you see it's where we belong?"" The theme of Palestinian displacement and rage is sounded again on the album's strangest song, ""Where Are They Now?"" A palimpsest of Charleston-dancing horns slams abruptly into furious Arabic raps by a pair of British-Palestinian MCs. The way Atzmon weaves exotic foreign figures into fusty Western standards is more than progressive fusion, seeming to angrily parody the besieged mindset of xenophobes and cultural purists everywhere. Leave it to Wyatt to craft a record that simultaneously celebrates and criticizes the limits of the traditional.</p></div>"|14761.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14761-for-the-ghosts-within/|7.7|Brian Howe

They then pitched themselves to an audience of Caledonophiles who worship the crashing songcraft of Frightened Rabbit, the Twilight Sad, and We Were Promised Jetpacks. Compared to their fellow countrymen, however, Broken Records sounded overcooked: too intense for their glossy production, too self-serious to be relatable, and, overall, too reliant on over-the-top dynamics.</p>
<p>Though Broken Records have made no major changes to the aggressively earnest sound on their second album, <i>Let Me Come Home</i>, they have made some adjustments for the better. The overall mood is a little darker and the production rawer. They locate moments of relative quiet or expansiveness, instead of pitching a constant aural assault. And frontman Jamie Sutherland, whose guttural Boss-with-a-brogue bellowing grates, finally allows himself to sound simple at times. When he gives over to his stirring baritone (as on the restrained, sparse piano ballad ""Dia Dos Namarados"" or the beginning of ""A Leaving Song"") he sounds haunted and vulnerable rather than like a drunk having a tantrum. Yes, there are still moments when he relies too heavily on his raving caterwaul or an equally irritating Coldplay-like falsetto keening, but they are blessedly fewer and farther between on this album.</p>
<p>Broken Records have been called the Scottish Arcade Fire, but that is true only in theory, because both are huge bands with huge sounds that are obsessed with huge ideas. In practice, Broken Records are actually more like the Killers with accents (or, more accurately, without fake accents). <i>Home</i>'s best track, ""A Darkness Rises Up"", recalls the Killers' own <i>Sam's Town</i>-era Springsteen affliction and plays like a sequel to ""When You Were Young"" with its insistent piano pounding, dramatically hushed bridge, and unrelenting drive. And like the Killers, Broken Records are strivers that sound so desperate to be liked that they give off a whiff of bloated (and unearned) self-importance.</p>
<p>But that said, the album's overall theme of searching for security resonates-- with the trifecta of ""The Leaving Song"", ""I Used To Dream"", and album closer ""Home"" forming a story arc of a man striking out on his own, looking for his place in the world, and wanting to return home-- and are nicely echoed in homey flourishes of Americana-influenced string arrangements and continual lyrical repetition. The band are smart to end with ""Home"", a track that not only offers the clearest sentiment (the loneliness-tinged, oft-repeated ""let me come home,"" which is obviously central to the record as it forms its title), but also closes the collection with a swooning whisper instead of a raucous bleat, which allows even the album's most bombastic moments to recede into your memory. <i>Let Me Come Home</i> is still too overworked, but, as that final song proves, it represents a welcome shift toward (relative) musical simplicity and lyrical honestly that shows that the band is heading in the right direction.</p></div>"|14745.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14745-let-me-come-home/|5.1|Rebecca Raber

Tinkering with fractured classic rock, drum-circle grooves, thrash, jazz, and just about anything else that happens to wiggle its way into the band's train of thought, NYMPH seem almost out to make music solely because it's fun for them to play. But with quirky style-appropriation and some flat-out ballsy performances, the band's dedication to exercising their pure id usually outweighs any of the numbing pretensions associated with underground rock, making this album bothÂ unpredictable and weirdly satisfying.</p>
<p>Sure, there are only three proper songs cozily nestled in between two spastic jams, the latter of which clocks in at 22 minutes. Those long, improvisational bookends are the album highlights: Save for the sax-anchored free-jazz of ""Reeds of Osirion"", opener ""ii-Yo"" and closer ""Namu"" deliver more woolly energy than their condensed counterparts.Â Instead of getting by solely on its obtuseness,<i> NYMPH</i> feels like the work of a proper rock band: Guitarist Matty McDermott's damaged blues and Jason Robira's spastic drum work on ""ii-Yo"" work together so well even the noisy contrasting moments seem purposefully arranged. All throughout, players collide into one another, providing a little release, a little confusion, and frequently a lot of style, helping richly characterize these two huge tracks.</p>
<p>Not that NYMPH are incapable of handling a little concision once and a while. Though the childish whimsy of ""Bird Song"" is ultimately more trying than anything else, ""Reeds of Osirion"" and ""Snow Song"" both make the most of NYMPH at half a click, teasing out little nuances that stick in your head. ""Snow Song"" plinks about coldly and curiously, featuring a melodic hook that seems to nick Danny Elfman's <i>Edward Scissorhands</i> score-- it's a simple, wonderfully associative detail that provides a somber, chilly backdrop for those frazzled blasts of guitar noise and shallow vocal gasps.

The current round of reissues and repackages includes the third and fourth posthumous boxed sets of his work, and the fifth-or-so stab at a greatest-hits compilation; they're still not nearly as satisfying as you'd expect from one of the most important figures in the history of rock. That's partly because Lennon spent his solo years painfully aware of how important he was, alternately trying to see how he could use his fame to act in the world and how he could rebel against his fame's trappings.</p>
<p>Lennon had gotten a head start on his solo career: In the final couple of years of the Beatles, he'd started batting out records as reports from the front, whether or not his bandmates were available or interested. In 1968 and 1969, he made three albums with Yoko Ono, in her idiom (conceptual art) but his medium (LPs), none of them in the current batch of reissues. The two of them also started releasing singles credited to the Plastic Ono Band-- a John song on the A-side, a Yoko song on the B-side. The first Plastic Ono Band single, ""Give Peace a Chance"", was the soundtrack to a clever bit of political branding; ""Cold Turkey"" was written and recorded very shortly after he kicked heroin, in late summer 1969; ""Instant Karma!"" was in record stores 10 days after it was written.</p>
<p>The odd thing about John and Yoko's simultaneously released, identically designed solo albums entitled <i>Plastic Ono Band</i> is that hers is more suited to repeated listening, but his is better as conceptual art. (It's still pretty good as music: He's backed up by Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, and longtime Beatles associate Klaus Voormann.) The concept was the biggest rock star in the world breaking his wand and burning his books; directly expressing his unseemly emotions; doing things he would never, ever have gotten away with in the Beatles. He starts the album by working himself up into a total howling breakdown about his parental abandonment issues-- in 1970, you <i>did not do that in public, ever</i>-- and spends the rest of it essentially stripping himself naked. (He'd already done that, literally, on the cover of his and Yoko's first collaboration, <i>Two Virgins</i>.) ""God"" takes the concept to its destination: it's Lennon declaring, bluntly, that every myth that has ever given his audience comfort, up to and including the Beatles, is no longer of use-- ""the dream is over.""</p>
<p>The Achilles' heel of <i>John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band</i> is that it's functionally very similar to the world's most privileged man having a tantrum; it's hard to hear it now without thinking of National Lampoon's ""Magical Misery Tour"", a dead-on pastiche of the album whose lyrics are entirely drawn from Lennon's legendarily withering 1970 <i>Rolling Stone</i> interview, ending with a repeated howl of ""genius is PAAAAAIN!"" But, yeah, it's a hell of an album, anyway.</p>
<p><i>Imagine</i> is one last visit to the edgy but likable variety show of White Album-era Beatles (""Jealous Guy"" is actually rewritten from the White Album demo ""Child of Nature""). Lennon still had an axe or five to grind-- ""How Do You Sleep?"" is an open attack on Paul McCartney (and features George Harrison on snarly slide guitar)-- and he was getting into an unfortunate habit of repeating himself: ""Oh Yoko!"" half-recycles a line from ""A Day in the Life"" as its refrain. But there are flashes of brilliance all over the record, from the unstoppable invective of ""Gimme Some Truth"" (""no short-haired yellow-bellied son of Tricky Dicky's gonna Mother Hubbard soft-soap me with just a pocketful of hope"") to the reverse-double-entendre bruiser ""It's So Hard"". If the title track sounds like hippie bullshit now, that's just because it's been played to death.</p>
<p>And then Lennon moved to New York and started hanging out with much bigger potheads than himself, and everything kind of went to hell for a while. <i>Some Time in New York City</i> is a reeking lump of an album, the low point of his catalogue. The first disc is Lennon and Ono trading off songs of sanctimonious, unconvincing agitprop, most of which were guaranteed to alienate the people they were ostensibly meant to convince. (A rock star starting his follow-up to a #1 album with a militant feminist anthem might have been a bracing idea in 1972, except that it's a witless 50s rock'n'roll pastiche called ""Woman Is the Nigger of the World"". Yeah, that'll help.) There's also the matter of Ono's songs: She's a superb artist and a very interesting musician and songwriter, and you should go listen to <i>Fly</i> if you don't believe me, but when she tried to write and sing in Lennon's idiom, she was simply not in the same league. The previous reissue of <i>Some Time</i> excised most of the second disc's shitty live jams; this one reinstates them.</p>
<p><i>Mind Games</i>, on the other hand, isn't particularly off-putting-- it's just creatively exhausted and timid. The title track has a nice tune; the session dudes who play on the album are entirely competent; ""Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)"" is a sweet sentiment. But there is not a single risky or urgent moment on the entire thing.</p>
<p>After he separated from Ono in 1973, Lennon moved to L.A. and made a pair of slick but emotionally turbulent albums. The linchpin of <i>Walls and Bridges</i>, ""Whatever Gets You Thru the Night"", featuring Elton John on piano, was Lennon's first solo #1 single, and a slightly jarring nod to disco. Its laissez-faire hedonism was pretty far from the persona Lennon had established, but he was obviously trying to get away from himself in general. A lot of the album, in fact, addresses the idea that he might have screwed up his life irreparably. ""Bless You"" is a love song to Yoko and a word of kindness to her potential new man; ""What You Got"" is straight-up L.A. funk; ""Scared"" and ""Steel and Glass"" are among the most self-lacerating songs Lennon ever wrote.</p>
<p>Required to record three songs owned by publisher Morris Levy as the result of a bizarre lawsuit over ""Come Together"", Lennon pieced together the all-covers album <i>Rock 'n' Roll</i> between 1973 and 1975. As drunken, phoned-in contractual-obligation records go, it's pretty entertaining-- he clearly adores the 50s-era rockers he revives here, and his signature high-note rasp makes ""Stand By Me"" and ""Just Because"" sound genuinely desperate. Pity about that reggae version of ""Do You Wanna Dance"", though. (The bonus tracks from the previous reissue are gone again.)</p>
<p>In early 1975, Lennon reunited with Ono, and essentially dropped out of public life for five years. The two of them resurfaced with 1980's <i>Double Fantasy</i>, on which they started a project of seeing if they could make pop music whose central subject wasn't romantic love, exactly, but mature domestic partnership and its particular joys and tensions. Lennon and Ono alternate songs, usually as conceptual pairs-- his specific ""Dear Yoko"" followed by her universalized ""Every Man Has a Woman Who Loves Him"", his harrowed ""I'm Losing You"" seguing directly into her weary response ""I'm Moving On"". Some of Ono's songs are still pretty ear-gouging on their own, but the point of the album, as with the Plastic Ono Band singles of a decade earlier, is how the couple play off one another. The new reissue pairs the original album with <i>Double Fantasy Stripped Down</i>, a entirely unnecessary new mix of the whole thing.</p>
<p>Lennon was murdered a few weeks after the release of <i>Double Fantasy</i>; his half of the identically constructed <i>Milk and Honey</i> is mostly casual performances of <i>Double Fantasy</i>-era songs he figured he might finish later, which means it's got a sense of looseness and fun that had been missing from his post-Beatles work. (The countoff for ""I Don't Wanna Face It"": ""Un! Deux! Eins zwei hickle pickle!"") A couple of John's songs here are fantastic, especially the inspired throwaway ""Nobody Told Me"", allegedly written for Ringo to sing. Yoko's aren't.</p>
<p>On top of the eight album reissues, there are three new reconfigurations of Lennon's solo material. <i>Signature Box</i> includes all of the above, minus <i>Double Fantasy Stripped Down</i>, plus two extra discs: ""Singles"" (the Lennon sides of five non-album Plastic Ono Band 45s, and the negligible 1975 B-side ""Move Over Ms. L.""), and <i>Home Tapes</i>, a bunch of outtakes and demos that somehow didn't appear on 1998's <i>John Lennon Anthology</i> box (highlight: an off-the-cuff home demo of ""Nobody Told Me""). Not included: the early John-and-Yoko experimental albums, <i>Live Peace in Toronto 1969</i>, and another six or seven discs' worth of posthumous releases.</p>
<p>A small handful of those missing recordings do show up, however, on <i>Gimme Some Truth</i>, an otherwise superfluous four-disc set that hits ""shuffle"" on the catalogue and sorts it into discs called ""Working Class Hero"" (social-consciousness songs), ""Woman"" (love songs), ""Borrowed Time"" (kind of songs about self-doubt except for the ones that aren't) and ""Roots"" (the entire <i>Rock 'n' Roll</i> album, plus a few other songs, but not the ones that were on the 1975 semi-bootleg called <i>Roots</i>).</p>
<p>Finally, there's <i>Power to the People: The Hits</i>, a single-disc (or CD + DVD) introduction whose title isn't quite accurate-- Top 5 single ""Nobody Told Me"" is absent, non-hits ""Gimme Some Truth"" and ""Jealous Guy"" are present. (""Happy Xmas [War Is Over]"" is, conveniently, right near the end of the sequence; there's nothing from <i>John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band</i>, <i>Some Time in New York City</i> or <i>Milk and Honey</i>.) Song-for-song, it's pretty terrific, but it's incoherent as an album. The Lennon it presents is a team player who lost his team and tried to replace it with a partnership, a great singer who trusted his voice so little that he tried to drown it in reverb, a persona prone to alternating fits of indignant rage and abject, dreamy apology. Of course he deserves better, but there's no way to give it to him: He asked for ideals, but he demanded the truth.</p></div>"|14754.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14754-signature-box-power-to-the-people-the-hits/|6.2|Douglas Wolk

When the version of the band that made debut album <i>Searching for the Young Soul Rebels</i> went on the road, they called it the ""Intense Emotions"" tour, and the music they made together bore that out. This 30thÂ anniversary reissue comes with a bonus disc covering the entire career of that first Dexys incarnation, from debut single ""Dance Stance"" to ""Plan B"", the first disc cut by Dexys Mark II. Repeated material from radio sessions means there's a certain amount of fat, especially if you own prior compilations. But if you're new to the band, this is an album that deserves the extended look.</p>
<p>Dexys thrived in a period of fierce, tribal pop loyalties by radiating and inspiring passion unusual even for the time. ""Dance Stance""-- reprised on the album as ""Burn It Down""-- sets out their stall, a brawling kind of soul, the band's thick, brass-driven sound topped by Rowland's combative yelp: ""Shut your mouth till you know the truth."" Indeed on parts of <i>Searching</i>, Rowland is so passionate he's barely comprehensible-- ""Thankfully Not Living in Yorkshire It Doesn't Apply"" is high-register babble; on ""There, There, My Dear"" his determination to prove a point turns the verses into an angry, thrilling tumult of words.</p>
<p>Rowland's artistic breakthrough came in applying the lessons of punk to the ideal of soul: If soul was a feeling, an inner fire, then the technical limitations of the singer were simply irrelevant. If you believed in yourself, your soul and the purity of your self-expression, you were a soul singer no matter how gulping and agonised your actual voice was. But <i>did</i> he believe in himself? Too contrarian to sing much about politics, Dexys were nonetheless an ideal band for a moment in which every aesthetic and lifestyle decision felt intensely political. Songs like ""There, There, My Dear"" lashed out at others for compromise and fakery, but Rowland was his own harshest critic. His ascetic self-doubt and self-scrutiny powered the band's career. This version of Dexys broke up after falling out over the release of ""Keep It Pt. II"" as a single-- four minutes of choked, howling self-flagellation from Rowland whose subtitle, ""Inferiority Pt. I"", says it all.</p>
<p>That single's B-Side, ""One Way Love"", was a vigorous soul cover-- Dexys' early catalogue is studded with them, and much of this set's second disc is taken up with versions of ""Respect"", ""Soul Finger"", and three goes at Johnny Johnson's terrific ""Breaking Down the Walls of Heartache"". While Rowland's psychodramas are more compelling, this scrappy, good-times side of the band helped build their fanbase. In fact the best moments come when Rowland marries his self-awareness to his group's instrumental toughness-- the loping gang-chant ""Geno"", smoldering ""I'm Just Looking"", and joyful stomper ""Tell Me When My Light Turns Green"". Rowland's obsessions would lead his band in ever more fascinating directions, but ultimately it's this line-up's aspiration to being a working soul band that makes <i>Searching</i> the tightest and most consistent Dexys album.</p></div>"|14755.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14755-searching-for-the-young-soul-rebels-30th-anniversary-edition/|8.9|Tom Ewing

When the most accessible vocal cut here is Simian Mobile Disco's own remix of DJ Hell's ""U Can Dance""-- wherein Bryan Ferry sounds like he's moonlighting at Satan's supper club-- you know you're not in SMD's usual user-friendly indie-remix territory. Cherry picking across three decades of dark dance (and not-quite-dance) music, SMD useÂ <i>Is Fixed</i> to explore house and techno's creepier impulses, tracks in which insistent basslines suddenly turn uncomfortably, claustrophobically insistent. And when they leave the rave behind, whether it's Conrad Schnitzler's fizzing pre-Detroit proto-electro or Etienne Jaumet's snarling post-Detroit neo-electro, SMD still favor synth riffs that feel more John Carpenter than Derrick May.</p>
<p>Like most modern DJs with point-and-click access to all eras and genres, SMD are freed up both chronologically and stylistically, for better or worse. Sleekly sculpted modern day minimal is joined, sometimes jarringly, to crude old-school house bangers. All of this decade-hopping and style-shuffling can make for some choppy transitions; <i>Is Fixed</i> certainly isn't the <i>smoothest</i> mix you'll hear this year. Like a lot of DJs who chase a mood even when it gets in the way of technical perfection, SMD will choose a jolt to the ears over an easy fade if it gets them where they need to go.  But the rough edges of the mixing actually suit the agitated, about-to-fray quality of certain tracks. This is dance music that wants to knot you up with tension, offering only little hints of ecstatic release. Even the minimal tunes, like Pitchfork contributor Philip Sherburne's ""Salt and Vinegar"", have the kind of tightly wound percussion that once gave old-school house its eerie tribal vibe.</p>
<p>That vintage acid-house atmosphere of delirium informs the whole mix. It's fitting the
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
n that SMD acknowledge acid's groove outright by including Bam Bam's ""Where's Your Child"", long the gold standard for goosebump-inducing first-generation acid singles, with its throbbing rhythm track punctuated (but not undone) by disorienting samples of shattering glass and screaming infants. More than 20 years later, ""Where's Your Child"" still feels like funk pitched up to the verge of a full-blown freakout, but like <i>Is Fixed</i>, it never quite tips over the edge.</p></div>"|14774.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14774-is-fixed/|6.5|Jess Harvell

Which explains how San Diego's Three Mile Pilot scored a deal with Geffen that lasted about as long as it will take to read this review. Now, Three Mile Pilot return after more than a decade of silence with <i>The Inevitable Past Is the Future Forgotten</i>. In the time since, 3MP'sÂ Pall Jenkins and Armistead Burwell Smith IV have kept busy-- Jenkins helmed the Black Heart Procession's brooding noir-rock over the span of six studio albums, while Smith co-founded Pinback with Rob Crow.</p>
<p>If you became familiar with the BHP and Pinback in the 2000s, it won't be a surprise about what 3MP sound like: Jenkins' voice is central and can expand likeÂ an accordion in terms of range and timbre. TheÂ instrumental construction is not far removed from recent Pinback, favoring clean, surgical guitars that prod and slice with precision and a production ethic that's as arid and frigid as the desert at night. While listeners more inured to the frillier, more electronic-based current iteration of indie might find 3MP somewhat repetitive (a valid complaint during Side B's slower numbers), there's a crucial motion that defines their interplay: With minimal accoutrement, every element feels like an interlocking gear pushing things forward. When they work in relatively high BPMs (""Same Mistake"", ""Left in Vain""), hooks tumble over each other. It's almost Krautrock-like in its mesmeric build.</p>
<p>But in a weird way, what preventsÂ <i>Inevitable </i>from arguing forÂ Three Mile PilotÂ as one of the lost treasures of 90s indie is that they sound too much like themselves; it's a weird situation when a band who achieved success amongst a small, intensely dedicated fanbase in their infancy could return from a 13-year hiatus without having become increasingly beloved in the interim. Meanwhile, the bands who sound like they've been clearly influenced by whatÂ Three Mile PilotÂ accomplished are ones their own members started. But they've never really been about the big gesture-- themes on this ostensibly ""triumphant return"" mostly seem to revolve around inertia and escape, though one of the telling first lyrics is, ""this is our battle and how it begun."" A fitting sentiment from a small, well-earned triumph for these few, hopefully not the last, guys who've become specialists in their field.</p></div>"|14778.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14778-the-inevitable-past-is-the-future-forgotten/|7.2|Ian Cohen

Yet the Brooklyn duo's approach to music making goes far beyond simply finding solutions to these problems. Dyer plays a modified baritone ukulele (the ""buke"" in the group's name) that, yes, is smaller than a guitar, but her cohort, Aron Sanchez, also plays a bastardized instrument (the ""gass,"" Sanchez's own Frankenstein melding of guitar and bass) for no other obvious reason than the fact that he can. Percussion is taken care of by drums and bells operated by the pair's feet, yet Buke and Gass purposefully abstain from utilizing prerecorded loops.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, all this ingenuity and rule-breaking engenders a noise that's quirky and bracing, and those are the hallmarks of Buke and Gass' debut album, <i>Riposte</i>. Dyer and Sanchez feed their respective buke and gass through amps and pedals, creating a buzzing, springy sound that brims with kinetic restlessness. Meanwhile, the foot-propelled percussion monolithically thwacks away, lending the duo's music an austerity that belies its post-punk roots (groups like the Ex, Swell Maps, and Theoretical Girls are some of the main spiritual godfathers here). Dyer's voice easily gets swept up in this nervy momentum, her girlish yelps often evoking Karen O. So twitchy and bursting with ideas are Buke and Gass that their songs have a tendency to jump abruptly from one passage to the next without ever finding resolution or an anchor, and it causes a measurable chunk of <i>Riposte</i>'s middle to blend together into something indistinguishable and a little wearying.</p>
<p>When Buke and Gass manage to focus their energy, however, the results are positively arresting. Standouts are several, starting with the opening ""Medulla Oblongata"", with its evocative lyrics and Dyer's breathless repetition of the words ""danger doctor"" (the album's strident, clinical lyrics are occasionally clumsy but actually suit the music well). Other highlights include the hypnotic, circular repetitions of ""Sleep Gets Your Ghost"", the fervent, psychosexual ""Bundletuck"" (""These days you wake up in a bundle of orgasm""), and the winking ""Outt!"" (""Everybody here is out to get you""). Dyer and Sanchez are the sort of artists who will continue to challenge themselves at every turn. As long as they can keep that boundless creativity from going in a million different directions at once, their listeners will reap plenty of rewards.</p></div>"|14697.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14697-riposte/|6.8|Joshua Love

That album, <i>Martial Arts Weekend</i>, served as a sort of test case for Darnielle's progression beyond his acoustic-guitar-and-boom-box years. Later that year, Darnielle's Mountain Goats released <i>Tallahassee</i> on 4AD, thus beginning their long and gradual transformation into an actual band. Darnielle and fellow veteran singer-songwriter Bruno haven't exactly been strangers since <i>Martial Arts Weekend</i>; I've seen Bruno join Darnielle onstage at at least a couple of shows. They're old friends, and this new record doesn't sound like a test case for anything. It sounds like a great novelist kicking out a book of short stories, just to shake out all the loose ideas he's had bouncing around in his head.</p>
<p>Most recent Mountain Goats albums have central themes or ideas or moods; they're not concept albums, exactly, but the songs seem intertwined in some ephemeral way. IfÂ <i>Undercard</i> has a central theme, it's this: people mired in mediocrity who find themselves trapped in desperate circumstances. ""Cruiserweights"" is an expertly rendered depiction of a boxer fighting in some shitty, inconsequential mid-80s Cleveland arena, feeling himself get pounded into liquid even though he realizes nobody's watching and that his fight is of little consequence. ""Only Existing Footage"" is a postcard from a doomed B-movie set. Even the album's lone cover, of Randy Newman's ""In Germany Before the War"", is a pretty mundane image of the killer from Fritz Lang'sÂ <i>M</i>.</p>
<p>Maybe the starkest illustration of the beaten-down comes from Bruno and works as a snapshot of one man's feelings in the moments following an adultery-induced car crash. The title of ""How I Left the Ministry"" tells us one little biographical nugget about the narrator that you won't get from the lyrics themselves, and the liner notes shed even more light: He's actually the leader of ""one of those franchised evangelical churches that dot San Bernadino County."" The liner notes of <i>Undercard</i> are generally a whole lot of fun: Darnielle and Bruno offering shards of commentary about every song-- sometimes revealing big, important things, sometimes not. The whole thing underscores the idea that these two are good friends who love writing, and who love writing together.</p>
<p>In its spare, sparkling production and its generally hushed tone, <i>Undercard</i> could musically pass for a new Mountain Goats record easily, especially as Darnielle sings the lead on every song. But there are some unexpected flourishes here, some of which work (the strum-stomp simplicity of ""Dogs of Clinic 17"", which actually reminds me of Against Me!), and some of which don't (the intrusively jazzy acoustic-guitar stabs on ""Rockin' Rockin' Twilight of the Gods""). Bruno sings harmony from time to time, and it's a kick to hear someone trying to harmonize with Darnielle's knotty yip and actually succeeding. But as with so many Darnielle-related projects, the words are what stick with you here. And even if there's no transcendent statement to be found, we're still left with these guys sketching out their own little Richard Brautigan short stories, rendering entire lives in quick, mysterious, devastating little strokes. If these guys wanted to make another one of these before another eight years elapse, I wouldn't be mad.</p></div>"|14751.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14751-undercard/|7.9|Tom Breihan

This might read like a throwaway line, but it sounds rueful and affectionate on record, a music vet happily and wearily reflecting on his youth.  Feck, the songwriting force behind minor indie pop legends Comet Gain, is the ringleader for this loose, beery one-off ensemble, which could be called an ""indie pop supergroup"" if that weren't an inherently ridiculous idea. Nonetheless, members of Crystal Stilts, the Clean, the Aislers Set, and the Ladybug Transistor all pop by at various points, and the music shimmers and jangles with all the requisite bittersweet colors. But it is Feck's presence-- self-deprecating, gin-wry, tinged with bitterness-- that provides the emotional anchor for <i>Cinema Red and Blue</i>,  a knowing and affecting power-pop record about the foibles of loving records too much.</p>
<p>""Ballad of a Vision Pure"" is the first of three consecutive songs deemed the ""ballad of"" something (a bus stop, an ""all-night worker"") but every song could easily be retitled ""Ballad of an Unreformed Pop Music Obsessive."" Songs about listening to pop songs are not a novel concept; in indie pop in particular, they're a hallowed tradition. But Feck and co. do them so <i>well</i>, with verve and loving attention to details lyrical and musical. These are songs about lonely people yearning to escape into art--  Melanie of ""Melanie Down"" listens to her radio alone in her room, while the ""cinema red and blue"" of the title pops up repeatedly as a metaphorical space for losing yourself in an all-encompassing experience. Feck readily acknowledges the dark side to this yearning; in ""Ghost Confessions"", he sings mournfully about ""listening to records that nobody wants/ Dreaming of moments that nobody's had/ Thinking of people that don't exist."" Anyone who chuckled at the Swell Maps joke might recoil a bit from the sting.</p>
<p>But wallowing in self-recrimination is an indulgence, and a dead end. Feck's outlook on <i>Cinema Red and Blue</i> works so well because itÂ neatlyÂ splits the difference between sourness and generosity. The sunny music helps; the jangly guitars are just as evocative next to a puttering drum machine as a boogie-rock organ. The album is rounded out by a handful of covers, (Dead Moon's ""Love in the Altitude"", the Chills' ""Brave Words"", ""Same Mistakes"" by Vic Godard and the Subway Sect); that they sit comfortably next to the originals highlights how well-conceived this one-off project is. The thread uniting the songs is not just a style but a sensibility, one Feck commandeers with the ease of an old Shakespearean actor. For all his ambivalence about the pull of pop-song love, he yields, finally, to affection, and <i>Cinema Red and Blue</i> glows with it. After that crack about trying to sound like the Swell Maps, he admits, fondly: ""I was only trying to do something good/ I was only trying to waste my youth/ I was only trying to make some sweet noise/ I was only trying to be a boy.""</p></div>"|14772.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14772-cinema-red-and-blue/|7.7|Jayson Greene

He had no choice-- he'd been paralyzed since a 1990 lighting rig accident. He was near the end of a life and career that saw him become one of the most influential songwriters and performers of his generation. He was a multi-instrumentalist, singer, songwriter, producer and thinker who had his hands in a lot of amazing music, and was among the first black pop artists to inject the ideas and hopes of the Civil Rights movement into his work, doing it subtly at first with the Impressions with ""Amen"" and ""Keep on Pushing"" and then much more directly later on.</p>
<p>Jazz, of course, got to openly supporting Civil Rights and expressing black pride before pop music did. Max Roach's 1960 <i>Freedom Now Suite</i> is a good example. Charles Mingus' 1959 classic ""Fables of Faubus"" was a sly and sarcastic takedown of Arkansas governor Orval Faubus after the Little Rock Nine incident-- the list is pretty long. Part of the reason jazz got there before Mayfield is that Mayfield was working within the constraints of pop radio, which is where all his record labels were aiming. In 1960, he couldn't have done what Max Roach was doing for the simple fact that no one would have given him the chance.</p>
<p>Jazz bassist William Parker was getting his start in the early 70s just as Mayfield went solo with a series of albums that very directly addressed issues of race, equality, and black pride. These themes have run through Parker's work as well for decades, so a tribute to Mayfield seems natural and fitting. Parker isn't simply interpreting or covering Mayfield's songs on <i>I Plan to Stay a Believer</i>, though. He's extending them, treating them as living documents, and adding new content that dovetails with Mayfield's political thoughts. Parker's notes on the recording explain his belief that every song has an ""inside song"" waiting to be reborn, and he implies that these are the songs he heard inside Mayfield's music.</p>
<p>Parker and his collaborators began work on this project nearly 10 years ago, and this final document is a live compilation of sorts, bringing together performances from 2001, 2002, 2007 and 2008 into a basically seamless whole that presents a panoramic exploration of both Mayfield's music and modern black identity over two discs. Actually, the recording dates are interesting, because three of these tracks were recorded in Italy just days before the election of Barack Obama, and there is a sort of old-school Civil Rights thrust to the additional poetry contributed by Amiri Baraka-- post-racial this is not, and it's sort of a pre-acknowledgement that having a black president won't automatically erase all of the nation's tormented racial history.</p>
<p>Looking across the two-disc track list is a little intimidating-- eight of the eleven tracks are over ten minutes long, with ""If There's a Hell Below"" topping out at 21:23, so you know up front that this won't be a casual listen. These songs twist and turn, invariably opening with musical motifs from Mayfield's originals-- the creeping bass line of ""Hell Below"", the funky riff of ""Freddie's Dead"", the ebullient horn fanfare of ""Move on Up"", here slowed, rounded off and made significantly darker-- and from there, it's anyone's guess where the energy of the performance will take the band. Gospel, bop, soul, funk, post-bop and free music are all part of this mix, and the band spends a lot of time between them as well. For instance, the 10-minute version of ""This Is My Country (New York)"" on disc two takes on the feel of an out-of-control revival, ultimately flying off the rails into an ecstatic muddle of squealing sax, shouting, and tumbling drums.</p>
<p>It has the feel of the type of project Charles Mingus might have taken on had he lived to see this century, ambitious and quasi-historical, but still swinging and loaded with content that takes many listens to unpack. The band is amazing. Several tracks feature choirs (including a choir of 90 children on two of those tracks), but they blend right in, adding to the dual vocal attack of Baraka and singer Leena Conquest, a long-time Parker collaborator who dances through these tangled arrangements and the heavy subject matter with tremendous grace. Asim Barnes plays guitar on only three tracks, but I could spend a whole paragraph breaking down why what he does is thrilling, and drummer Hamid Drake is strictly next-level on every song. The way he switches between a slow, swinging beat and a double-time stomp on ""Move on Up"" is breathtaking and helps transform the song into a living, pulsing beast-- Conquest riffs on ""Keep on Pushing"" as the song begins to break down and head off into freer territory, and if you've spent any amount of time digging Mayfield in the past, you will love the way she does it.</p>
<p>I wish I could've seen some of these performances in person, because the amount of energy the band packs into them surely must have flowed right into the crowd. Even here, pressed onto little plastic discs, the band practically explodes toward you. I have no idea what Mayfield would think of these versions of his songs, but it's hard to imagine him being anything but flattered by the immense thought and planning that clearly went into these arrangements. To pull and stretch these songs so much and still preserve their essential identity is a true feat of art.</p></div>"|14762.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14762-i-plan-to-stay-a-believer-the-inside-songs-of-curtis-mayfield/|8.2|Joe Tangari

Reminiscent of Konkurrent's In the Fish Tank series, Way Slow (which will feature the likes of Ganglians and Sonny and the Sunsets' Sonny Smith in the near future) seems like a smart way to accommodate diehard fans and allow artists to indulge in fringe fantasies. So it's a little disappointing that Lefse kicks things off with aÂ wishy-washy handful of tracks from a still-developing and emerging artist.</p>
<p>Basically, it's hard to get into the embryonic noodlings of an artist that we don't even know all that well yet. After releasing a few leftfield covers by the likes of Radiohead and Burial online, Banjo or Freakout (aka Alessio Natalizia) has one EP and a handful of original tracks to his name, most of which feel rooted to the ghosted dream-pop sketches that appear here. The problem is, as good as a few of them were, even his previous releases sound underdeveloped. Compared to this batch though, they sound downright accomplished. And at a time when there's so much uninformed bedroom music going around, the last thing you should be considering is taking a step backwards.</p>
<p>This incarnation of Banjo or Freakout seems most interested in taking intimate, simple acoustic songs and obstructing them with aquatic atmospheres, spare percussion, and plenty of delay. With some of his more ambitious work (like those oddball covers), Natalizia was often able to create some compelling, otherworldly music-- something that would've been a perfect fit for a project like Way Slow. But instead of contributing something surprising or irreverent (""Street Runners"" comes close), most of these auxiliary details just clutter what are otherwise sleepy coffee-house strummers.</p>
<p>There's some wisdom in keeping things simple here. Banjo or Freakout's best song to date, ""Upside Down"", was a restrained, accessible piece that showed us what Natalizia was capable of when a more direct approach was taken (never mind there's a similar sounding but lesser version here in ""75""). But we also know what Natalizia is capable of when he lets his freak flag fly a little, and with so much creative flexibility at his disposal, wouldn't this have been a perfect time to do it? Maybe one day we'll look back at these songs with a different kind of perspective after Banjo or Freakout has taken the time to develop. Until then, <i>Volume One</i> feels not only premature, but a little presumptuous.</p></div>"|14749.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14749-way-slow-volume-one/|5.5|Zach Kelly

The avuncular Australian came up in the 1990s as a member of the Simpletons and played on a bunch of recordings by much-loved countrymen the Lucksmiths. In the course of releasing three fine solo albums over the past decade, Hanlon has toured with Billy Bragg, the Magnetic Fields, and Jeffrey Lewis. With enough wry charm and vivid detail to withstand such comparisons, Hanlon's unassuming brand of indie-pop digs up the mundane or eccentric and scrapes off the dirt until he hits on something universal. Until now, however, he's never enjoyed a proper U.S. promotional push.</p>
<p>Each of Hanlon's albums has moments worth revisiting, but <i>I Will Love You at All</i> is his most consistently rewarding effort yet. Not only because, as befits the self-described ""urban folk"" singer's leap from Melbourne's now-defunct Candle Records to North Carolina-based Yep Roc, it's also his most American: Adam Selzer (M. Ward, She &amp; Him, the Decemberists) recorded the album in Portland, so there's a familiarly Pacific Northwestern tint, not least in longtime Selzer collaborator Rachel Blumberg's meticulously understated drumming. What most sets Hanlon's fourth album apart from its predecessors, though, is that he's no longer singing about squash or the noisy punk-rock girl upstairs; when he shows off his tremendous wit, it's now in subtler and more lasting ways than proving he can shoehorn the word ""aubergine"" into a catchy song. This is a record of heartbreak, rendered richly enough that you might not notice it. It's also an immensely funny record, with enough real emotion behind it that you might not notice <i>that</i>, either.</p>
<p>It doesn't hurt that there's a lot more variety between songs than you expect from your typical heart-on-sleeve troubadour-- or, hell, from most bands in this era of tinier and tinier niches. Ukulele, euphonium, and strings enliven ""All These Things"", an affecting call-and-response duet with Shelley Short about the trivia that comes to define us. ""Scenes From a Separation"" depicts beautifully just what its title says, but with keyboards, a waltzing-Matilda rhythm and more backing vocals from both Short and Alia Farah. Opener ""Butterfly Bones"", about someone who injures easily, sets viola, trumpet, and hammered percussion over syncopated acoustic chords; ""Buy Me Presents"" rattles like the Modern Lovers' ""Roadrunner"" amid bongos, saxophone, and sly observations about fear of commitment. Only grandiose piano ballad ""What Can We Say?"" feels like a relative misstep.</p>
<p>As on records by anyone from Loudon Wainwright III to Jens Lekman, it's Hanlon's distinctive narrative vision that holds it all together, rewarding the attention this album requires. Nearly eight-minute centerpiece ""House"" isn't the album's best track-- that's ""Folk Insomnia"", a stripped-down jaunt about broken hearts and growing older-- but it's the best encapsulation of Hanlon's gift for funny, pathos-laden detail. There's a terrible Barenaked Ladies song called ""The Old Apartment"", where they do little more than state the obvious: ""This is where we used to live."" Here, Hanlon does just about the opposite, documenting all his idiosyncratic thoughts as he debates going into an old home, notices the wall's new color-- ""the horror!""-- and finally comes to terms with the changes, in a crescendo of guitar and Blumberg's drums. Memories, Hanlon concludes, are ""best if they're left in a place you can't find them."" If <i>I Will Love You at All</i> is Hanlon's ""mature"" album, then maturing is less about embracing the flux than accepting it, moving on to the next misadventure, and then sharing stories about it all over beers.</p></div>"|14746.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14746-i-will-love-you-at-all/|7.6|Marc Hogan

More likely, you first encountered them as a viral video, a meme, a performance art collective, a joke that left you searching for the punchline, or some combination of the above. Hell, when we first profiled the group, it was under the headline <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/7766-die-antwoord/"" target=""_blank"">""Who the Hell Are Die Antwoord?""</a></p>
<p>Our introduction came last winter, when Boing Boing first posted a pair of their videos. Combining documentary elements with a surreal undercurrent, the clips were funny, confounding, and unique, the sort of thing that you forward to your friends and then do online detective work to learn more about what you're watching and sharing. There was a full music video for their second single, <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/#/musicvideo/8647-die-antwoord-enter-the-ninja-self-released"" target=""_blank"">""Enter the Ninja""</a>, but the first thing most of us were entranced by, the element that articulated and contextualized in some small way who DA were, was a promotional piece about the group called <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q77YBmtd2Rw"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Zef Side""</a>. There was music in it, but it served only as a soundtrack to the band's off-the-charts personalities-- you got leader and MC Ninja's testicles dancing in Pink Floyd shorts in slow motion, along with the first hints at fellow MC Yo-Landi Vi$$er's strident, low-rent toughness, which was eventually cited by David Fincher as a potential cinematic look for the femme-hero of <i>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</i> books.</p>
<p>Ninja and Yo-Landi aren't just striking visual curiosities, either; they're underrated MCs and pop personalities-- much more talented on the mic than they're credited for. They're also captivating live, where the visual fakery of what they do isn't lost; the simple challenge and central difficulty of their debut record, <i>$O$</i>-- most of which was released as a free download last year-- is to fully put across who or what Die Antwoord are when all you have to guide you through their world is recorded music.</p>
<p>It does all come together on ""Enter the Ninja""-- still a fantastic single-- in part because it's an origin story. Ninja here works in and around aspirational hip-hop tropes and clichÃ©s, giving listeners me vs. the world self-helpsims alongside superhero boasts alongside regular-guy humility. It's catchy, clever, and funny-- full of excellent deadpan jokes (""They said I was a fuckin' psycho... well look at me now!"") and forceful rave-rap. Also touched upon are the notions of racial confusion and an introduction to Zef culture, a sort of South African version of white trash. But while this bait to intellectualize the project might carry more weight in the racial powderkeg of SA, it's confusing at best outside of it, requiring more footnotes than most will have time for. No fault of Die Antwoord of course, but the racial and social implications of various ethnic groups in and around South Africa was always going to lose much of its potential power and cachet away from home. That in itself is a lamentable reality: South African apartheid, a more literal black-and-white issue, became a global civil rights cause in the 1980s; the subtle, complex, and all-too-real racial politics and biases since are more difficult to address, confront, and defeat.</p>
<p>The loss of the Zef and racial aspects of the project also highlight how much the Die Antwoord project suffers the further away from visuals it moves. For all the shit Lady Gaga or Nicki Minaj get about their potential cultural signifiers not showing up in their music, they at least create tracks that work on their own. So too did great conceptual pop stars of the past like the KLF or Adam &amp; the Ants or the Sex Pistols. Die Antwoord try here and often fail, for some of the same reasons that the concepts themselves are confusing-- they're a jumble sale of mixed-up ideas and items. Ironically, Ninja and Yo-Landi's vast array of skills betray them here, and songs too often feel overstuffed or schizophrenic.</p>
<p>Frustratingly, most songs have great ideas in them, sitting alongside creative dead ends. The overall sound of the record-- to be reductionist, rave-rap-- is a welcome trend, and it proves they have their ear to the ground. If this is to be an ongoing project, they're off to a weirdly good start, despite the many reservations here on this record: They've put together a group of people with skills, ideas, and personalities, and they seem more than capable of piecing together an excellent 21st century rap record. But this isn't it. Still serving to introduce the project, despite much of the music being around now for months, the album is mostly a literal retread of the sounds a lot of us heard in February and March. It seems like one piece of the conceptual puzzle rather than something that stands on its own.</p>
<p>Ideally, Die Antwoord can now move forward with the freedom to not simply be ""that Zef side group,"" but to be a hip-hop group full stop. That's often a death wish for pop stars-- the charismatic performer wanting to take full control of their vision in order to prove their artistry. Thing is, DA have proven gifted at doing both. Creating music and then adding meme-friendly visuals in aid of that, rather than the other way around, could actually find them improving by leaps and bounds, without losing what's special and unique and head-turning about them in the first place.</p></div>"|14766.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14766-o/|5.5|Scott Plagenhoef

A new label, its first release comes from Jon McMillion, a PacNW native who has previously recorded for Orac, another Seattle outfit dedicated to the fuzzy fringes of techno and house.Â These somewhat peripheral associations matter only insofar as they situate McMillion's debut album in a wider context, and because they might help to explain how and why it differs from the vast majority of similarly paced and structured electronic music. This isn't the kind of sound that can come out of just anywhere. It needs community and roots to nurture its more esoteric or eccentric tendencies, and it helps to have distance from the world's principal club-music centers, where market tastes too often dictate the shape of the music. You can hear how that breathing room has benefited McMillion: This is one of the most confident, expressive, and rewarding albums that house music has seen this year.</p>
<p>The <i>Jon McMillion LP</i> isn't an experimental work, nor even an explicitly groundbreaking one; its 15 tracks explore a familiar depiction of house, one whose mold has been shaped by Moodymann, Matthew Herbert, PÃ©pÃ©Â Bradock, IsolÃ©e, Ricardo Villalobos, and others. However, like them, McMillion has a voice that's immediately recognizable; in a decade or so of producing electronic music, he's clearly become a master of his craft. His approach is neither expressly digital nor analog; it has the warmth of vintage drum machines, Rhodes keyboards, analog synthesizers, and layer upon layer of processed vocals, but it maps a sense of space-- unstable, porous, with shifting dimensions and contours--Â that comes with computer-based processing and arrangements. His many interwoven lines suggest a collage aesthetic, of real-time machine jams chopped and soldered, and his slowly contorting funk is unusually organic.</p>
<p>The album comes in two different versions: The CD features nine tracks (including two exclusives), and the download version 13 (with six exclusives). Somewhat oddly, the sequencing of each is radically different, a detail that suggests the way the music generates its own possibilities. There's no definitive listening order: the CD version presents one potential, ideal form of the album, but the more you mix its sequencing up, the more you'll begin to notice details-- a buried voice, a strange, electronic ripple-- that had previously remained hidden.</p>
<p>If you had to spell out McMillion's influences, you could name classic Midwestern techno and house, European minimal, 90s R&amp;B, a smattering of dub and disco, and occasional sonics borrowed from progressive rock or experimental computer music. Once or twice the Durutti Column and even Derek Bailey rear their heads; it's not a stretch to hear Arthur Russell's influence in McMillion's muted, soulful vocals, and the explosions of tone color even gesture towards Flying Lotus' brand of digital astral jazz.</p>
<p>That's a lot to squeeze in, but McMillion fuses it elegantly and exquisitely: This is supple, seductive stuff, drawing you in closer and veiling the mechanics at its heart. As soon as you fix upon a given sound, you're reminded that everything is in motion around it. There's far too much to grasp at once, from polyrhythmic percussion lines to slowly evolving tone colors, but the record never overwhelms. Quite the opposite: It's difficult to imagine more inviting, easygoing grooves or arrangements, no matter how complicated they might be beneath the surface.</p></div>"|14759.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14759-jon-mcmillion-lp/|8.0|Philip Sherburne

Like DJ Shadow and Madlib before him, the Gaslamp Killer's record collection is, presumably, so large and unwieldy that what we're listening to is the sound of someone being devoured by his own resources. <i>Death Gate</i> continues the trend: In just over 15 minutes, there are enough scraps of sound for another artist to create a whole album. But what's most intriguing about Gaslamp Killer is that, like early Shadow and Madlib, he has an understanding of restraint. With so much music to draw from, there's a tendency to want to throw out your whole arsenal. But if there's anything connecting these five tracks it's a sense of minimalism-- even tastefulness.</p>
<p>As you might guess, marijuana is a key inspiration here. In a recent interview with Resident Advisor, Gaslamp Killer professes that his aspiration is to have a weed hook-up in whatever city he's in; that way, he can get stoned as soon as he gets off the plane. Back when the mighty herb was half as powerful and half the price, you had dub and jazz and stoner-rock to get high to. Nowadays, with hydroponic technology moving as fast as the Internet, you have all of them in one. Which, at its best, is precisely what the Gaslamp Killer does.</p>
<p>""Shattering Inner Journeys"" could serve as the Gaslamp Killer's manifesto, and it's easily his best track to date. In a strikingly raw six minutes, Raymond Scott-style library synth squeals creep over a drum break ripped out of a mid-1990s Mo' Wax vault, bleeding into an appropriately eerie <i>Piper at the Gates of Dawn</i> homage. And then in the last minute, the song chugs out on an oddly dubby proto-industrial pitter-patter. Snaky, whiny crunk-rap keyboard riffs twirl around a skittering synth-drum beat on opener ""Fun Over 100"", and the remainder rock gut-punch, battered hip-hop beats that sound like old Company Flow bootleg instrumental tapes. Though these tracks can be somewhat compressed, there is a noticeable paucity of instruments, typically relying on little more than drums and a keyboard or guitar lick.</p>
<p>The Gaslamp Killer's profile was raised substantially by his production work on Gonjasufi's <i>A Sufi and a Killer</i>, and ""When I'm in Awe"" is like a lost track from it, almost to a fault. Within that album, the track would have fit into its whacked-out, garage-Rasta drug nightmare. But here it feels more like a bonus track, especially compared to the rest of the EP, which foregoes that album's Beefheart-hop sound for pronounced percussive instrumentals.</p>
<p>The era and sound that the Gaslamp Killer is going for is pretty easy to identify: the b-boy end of sample-heavy mid-90s hip-hop. But the way that he approaches his tracks is distinctive both in what he adds as well as what he leaves out. What will a Gaslamp Killer LP sound like? It's hard to tell, which, in this case, is an exciting prospect.</p></div>"|14768.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14768-death-gate-ep/|7.5|Tal Rosenberg
