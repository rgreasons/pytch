The evocatively dubbed New Jersey seven-piece may actually ply its trade in shambling folk-rock, but don't think for an instant this group's not worthy of its morbid moniker, not when the band's newest album, <i>My Son's Home</i>, is so deeply, resolutely soaked in bodily and spiritual dissolution.</p>
<p>First things first, however, listening to the Roadside Graves does require a certain suspension of disbelief. These guys have taken a significant number of pages from Bob Dylan and the Band's <i>Basement Tapes</i> playbook, which I guess makes them doubly antiquated by dint of borrowing heavily from 60s musicians who were themselves resurrecting early 20th century song forms. Lead singer John Gleason warbles in a wavering whine that's cousin to Dylan's legendary wheeze, and musically the group makes liberal use of accordion, organ, and barroom ivories. The women you meet in these songs are going to have names like Ruby and Delia that nobody under the age of 80 actually owns anymore.</p>
<p>Certainly these moldy affectations can be an impediment when you're trying to enjoy music on your iPod in 2009, but if you'll allow the Graves their need to play dress-up, <i>My Son's Home</i> is well-stocked with stirring narratives and sketches that just happen to be almost unremittingly obsessed with the crypt. Yet what's really remarkable about the record is the band's ability to treat death from so many different perspectives and with such a widely divergent range of moods and sympathies. There are moments of haunting, fragile stillness here, particularly the Josh Ritter-ish ""Wooden Walls"" and the elegiac, mandolin-trilling ""To the Sea"", yet anger flares up too, in the bitter ""God Touched Me"", a bravura mini-epic that initially rides a pulsing, faintly malevolent organ but resolves on a harmony-laden outro that evokes a demented ""Hey Jude"".</p>
<p>As war is one of death's most helpful earthly engineers, it should be no surprise that armed combat is such a heavily recurring motif on the album as well, starting with its title track, a heartbreakingly precise snapshot of a family awaiting the return of their solider son, possibly in a coffin. Elsewhere, there are images of flowers on a brother's grave ""next to his number and name,"" a leg lost presumably in battle and a narrator who ""left a path of blood back in Vietnam.""</p>
<p>Perhaps most admirably of all, the Roadside Graves excel at the brave and difficult paradox of suffusing death with life, injecting vivacity and humor into their reflections on mortality. Musically, the boozily raucous, devil-may-care singalong ""Ruby"" proves someone in the band's been listening to The Pogues, while lyrically it erases the line between sex and death until they're literally under the same roof (grandma dead in her chair with a  cigarette in hand while ""you and I were on the couch touching each other""). ""Dirty Work"" revels in the same messy collision, mentioning a hearse and a father in the past tense yet concluding with a guy apparently pleasuring himself in the corner of an Elks Lodge's kitchen. And of course there's a murder ballad of sorts to boot, ""Where the Water Flows"", though in this case it's sporting a bristling college-rock riff to complement a tale wherein ""I followed her by the light of the moon"" gives way to ""they found her by the side of the road."" No time to dig a hole for this unfortunate victim, however-- the Roadside Graves have already moved on to the next last throes, the next death rattle.</p></div>"|13175.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13175-my-sons-home/|7.0|Joshua Love

<p class=""MsoNormal"">No upside.<span> </span>Skills won't translate to the ""next level.""<span> </span>Gimmicky.<span> </span>If he's on the wrong team, he'll be exposed as a limited talent who's been coddled by swagger-hating purists.<span> </span>Wale loves himself some NBA namedrops, so even as <i>The Mixtape About Nothing </i><span>stands as one of 2008's best rap albums, it can't sit well with him that his detractors talk about him as if he were college star/NBA rookie Tyler Hansborough.<span> </span>Especially since he closes out </span><i>Back to the Feature </i><span>by coincidentally comparing himself to Psycho T's new teammate, the far more physically dominant scoring machine Danny Granger.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So it's understandable that he's gotten a little defensive on <i>Back to the Feature, </i><span>if not a little worrying-- </span><i>Nothing</i><span>'s biggest risk</span><i> </i><span>wasn't its sampling of Seinfeld, but the spots where he threatened to get too caught up in the navel-focused minutiae of being an up-and-coming rapper (answering MySpace requests, Soundscan numbers, etc.).<span> </span>Despite </span><i>Feature</i><span>'s motivation</span><i> </i><span>(""we just wanna let these broads know, [we] be rappin'""), the secondary theme is constraint-- being boxed into the same old comparisons (Lupe, Lil' Wayne) and the fishbowl effect of internet tastemaking, where the ability of haters to bring him down far exceeds his ability to rise above it. ""Think Barack got it bad, try being a rapper"" goes a particularly overreaching line, and if Wale isn't exactly gunning down his detractors, he's at least trying to let them in to more than just his shoe closet (though he still boasts about having property in Beaverton and ""Phil knight talking about, 'How you got them?'"").<span> </span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">You might not think that was the case judging from the features-- Talib Kweli, Royce Da 5'9"", Joe Budden, Skyzoo, Joell Ortiz.<span> </span>Basically, if you've heard someone recently complain about how post-Kanye and/or southern trends have ruined hip-hop, those are the guys they're probably saying you need to listen to instead.<span> </span>True or not, it's hard to overlook the fact that all of these guys are super talents, and in terms of pure quotables, <i>Feature </i><span>has few peers this year.<span> </span>The feature-heavy lineup can detract from Wale being able to display his personality, a sort of Everyman that skirts the usual blue-collar connotations of that word to embody the sort of person for whom constant immersion in ESPN.com results in pop culture references finding themselves infecting every part of their life-- from relationship dust-ups (""I wouldn't fuck another girl out in the club/ I was Rodney Stuckey, wasn't giving my number up,""), to dealing with overzealous fans (""They be hawkin'/ I call them hoes Josh Smith"") to just general shit-talk (""new MJ's hurting their eyes like Amare,"" ""you ain't doin' shit til you put…uh…10 g's on fantasy football"").<span> </span>I could listen to him go off on that all day.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span><span>But the idea of Wale being only as good as his team takes on added weight in terms of the production-- though he boasts that 9th Wonder is a legend with all kinds of beats, here he's more content to ladle out bowls of turn-of-the-decade comfort food that envision a dystopia where Little Brother's <i>The Minstrel Show </i><span>actually guided the course of hip-hop.<span> </span>It's most certainly a gimmick move to rap over Peter Bjorn and John's ""Nothing to Worry About"", but also kind of a relief to hear Wale on a beat where the drums don't sound like they're stuffed with down comforters.<span> </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Not surprisingly, the most exciting stuff here comes when just about anyone other than 9th is behind the boards-- ""Um Ricka"" features unsurprisingly horn-heavy production from Mark Ronson, but more surprisingly is how K'Naan can do an obvious ""hey, you think you can rap about Africa?"" verse and not sound like he's done it dozens of times already.<span> </span>Even better is Ronson's grimy, Premiere-evoking ""Pot of Gold"" as well as the surprisingly underutilized Best Kept Secret, who expertly handles the waterworks on the closing ""New Soul"".<span> </span>Plus if Wale's DMV thing ever falls through, I'd hope he'd consider relocating to Philadelphia to become a permanent member of State Property-- ""Cyphr"" and ""Hot Shyt"", as their titles indicate, are little more than a bunch of guys rapping their asses off over minimally dressed bangers, and few do it better than Black Thought, Freeway, Peedi Crakk, and here even Young Chris.<span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><i>Back to the Feature </i><span>certainly stands as a worthy follow-up to </span><i>The Mixtape About Nothing</i><span>, but I can't help but think of it in the terms of how 2007's most unorthodox commercial success story (the ""Radiohead model"") bears such
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
similarity to 2008's (the ""Lil' Wayne model"")-- the fact that they're considered ""models"" instead of a strange commingling of irreplicable circumstances has hurt way more artists than it helped, especially those without a decade's worth of goodwill.<span> </span>With Wale and hip-hop in general, it feels even more pronounced: ""They used to call me the future/ A month later, say ""fuck it-- I've grown used to him'.""<span> </span>It's not an easy situation to be in, to have fans who bitch about how rappers aren't making classic albums anymore, but expect nearly constant production from the new guys.<span> </span>But as Asher Roth and Charles Hamilton and such have ultimately proven, it's not like those people are really the fans worth staking your career on.<span> </span>If tapes like </span><i>Back to the Feature </i><span>are what we can expect from Wale should this whole ""ft. Lady Gaga"" thing not work out, that's fine, but instead of shouting out his classmates in the XXL Freshman 10, he might want to put up his Nike Boots for a minute and learn from their mistakes.<span> </span></span></p>

A boyfriend and girlfriend, he equipped with acoustic guitar, she with accordion, singing intensely earnest songs redolent of natural imagery that espouse with near-monomaniacal zeal a belief in the deep interconnectedness of human beings, animals, and the Earth. At a glance the whole thing smacks of hippie bullshit, but Phil Moore and Beth Tacular aren't trying to guilt you into making a donation to PETA, and they sure as shit aren't trying to take you on some lysergic-fueled trip. Certainly these guys have a particular worldview, but it's largely because of that purity of vision that the group's music succeeds, creating an immersive listening experience that can yield beauty and magic for anyone who isn't wholly given over to cynicism.</p>
<p>Bowerbirds' second LP, <i>Upper Air</i>, is nearly a carbon copy of its predecessor, <i>Hymns for a Dark Horse</i>. I'm going to let the band off the hook for the holding pattern; in the meantime, we'll simply revel in the general loveliness of these 10 compositions, which utilize the debut's blueprints in the creation of sublime melodies, absorbing lyricism and delicate harmonic interplay.</p>
<p>As I said before, listening to Bowerbirds demands immersion. It's not hard to scoff at a line like ""At the margins of the land I get to know your skin"" or ""I live in your tall tree amongst your fearless leaves"" if you're only dipping a toe. However, once you surrender to the group's internal logic, its values and ways of speech, the effect is routinely mesmerizing, not to mention far wiser and more self-aware than you'd expect at first blush. Take ""Teeth"", where Tacular's accordion seems to teeter between sorrow and resilience while the words offer the matching promise of ""a brilliant flame in a dark time."" Or ""Northern Lights"", which grounds its flights of fancy (""I don't need from you a waterfall of careless praise"") in faintly <i>Zeppelin III</i>-ish acoustic strumming and the great line, ""I don't expect a Southern girl to know the Northern Lights."" Once you've surrendered to Bowerbirds' verdant landscapes and convinced yourself they're not so drastically different from your own, it's suddenly not so hard to follow Moore as he spirals out tendrils of imagery like ""Further up in the Ponderosa/ The nervous coyotes caterwauling their choruses.""</p>
<p>Above all else, two moments stand out, and mostly rectify the fact that the middle third of the album is sparse on melodies and the closer (""This Day"") is a dull dud. Aside from providing a great potential name for a Pavement cover band, ""Crooked Lust"" finds Moore compellingly stretching outside his usual vocal range atop subtly entrancing marimbas. Meanwhile, ""Silver Clouds"" perhaps constitutes the most beautiful thing Bowerbirds have yet committed to record, as Moore's voice dips and breaks in all sorts of spine-tingling ways, cautioning, ""You could move like a silver cloud through the skies/ You could move like a secret and slip past my life."" It's just another fragile, evocative snapshot of an insular world that's paradoxically as big as all outdoors.</p></div>"|13312.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13312-upper-air/|7.2|Joshua Love

Point being: What's not there often counts for as much as, if not more than, what is. Music, too, of course has its share of sounds defined by the silences that surround them, and Seattle's Jesy Fortino is one of the finest purveyors of such sounds going. <i>Hands Across the Void</i>, her Sub Pop-stamped 2007 full-length debut as Tiny Vipers, felt strung together by the spaces between the notes as much as the singer's formidable voice, a wayworn and woebegone warble. Indeed, that record's title calls to mind the act of strumming across an acoustic guitar, the ""void"" in question being the empty space within the instrument's body-- the very non-thing that allows it to resonate.<br><br>This same sense of lack and loss, and of the power of all things absent and missing and distant, surges through Fortino's follow-up, <i>Life on Earth</i>. The title is ironic, taken as it is from a line on the record's 10-minute eponymous centerpiece. ""Don't look back towards me/ I'm as empty as the sea/ Back before there was life on earth,"" Fortino advises there, decisively undermining any warm and fuzzy notions the words ""life on earth"" might give us with a staggering image of a vast ocean of nothing. The music on <i>Life</i>, centered on Fortino's stately strums, only bolsters this image. Even when new sounds surface, such as the foghorn-like bass drones that carry ""Time Takes"" into ""Young God"", the whistled passage at the end of ""Development"", or the phantom chimes that punctuate ""Twilight Property"", they don't so much fill the void as draw further attention to it. Fortino's lyrics play to the prevailing mood as well, eschewing proper nouns and direct allusions completely and abounding in unnamed ""he""s and ""you""s who seldom seem to exist in the record's present. Nearly every song makes mention of death, interment, or ghosts; summertime easy listening this ain't.<br><br>Taken as a whole, <i>Life</i> doesn't really depart from <i>Hands Across the Void</i> (itself not exactly a cheery record), but rather refines and builds upon it, besting the previous album's runtime by a factor of 1.5 and boasting, as a bonus, a number of melodies that stick like tar in spite of their spareness-- particularly on the title track, opener ""Eyes Like Ours"", and album highlight"" Dreamer"". At nearly 65 minutes, it's relentless and uncompromising in its vision. Yet despite the lyrical preoccupations and the unyielding sense of absence, that vision is not necessarily a bleak one. Solemn? Sure. Severe? At times. But Fortino remains a consistent and oddly reassuring presence throughout. She isn't lamenting her woes nor letting herself get swept up in them, but rather surveying and relating, almost always with a certain austerity and remove. Only very occasionally does she break form and let the emotion behind the words loose, and when she does, the intensity is chilling. By the final bars of closing track ""Outside"", she can no longer contain herself, honing in on one last sentiment and sharing it eight times over: ""It will always be somebody else [outside]."" You can almost feel her eyes ablaze as she repeats it; it's as though she's at last harnessed the power of absence and made it her own.</br></br></br></br></p></div>"|13178.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13178-life-on-earth/|7.8|Matthew Solarski

His gorgeously haunted debut Drift makes it clear that while he shares a lot with Flying Lotus-- a base of operations, like-minded compatriots, a deep love of hip-hop and a thousand strains of electronic music-- they're pretty<b> </b>far apart in terms of approach. Spatially speaking, Flying Lotus' music is like a cluttered studio apartment overflowing with interesting bric-a-brac-- hip-hop records, comics, pieces of modern art. Chung's music, meanwhile, is spacious and reverberant, every element echoing into the emptiness surrounding it. Drift came out on Alpha Pup, the label run by underground hip-hop producer Daddy Kev, and Nosaj Thing produced tracks on Busdriver's latest record, but Drift has little of anything that might be recognized as ""hip-hop"" on it, none of Flying Lotus' breakbeats or his analog-tape warmth. From a mood point of view, its gloomy beatscapes have a lot more in common with the bass-heavy London dubstep scene than anything his fellow L.A. laptop nerds are doing.</p>
<p><i>Drift'</i>s dubstep influence is immediately apparent in the chilly minor-key synths and fractured, ghostly drum programming of ""Us"" and ""Fog"", which evokes Burial. Chung has a similar flair for atmospherics and fondness for dank spaces; the drum sounds on ""IOIO"" resemble both the dripping of leaky pipes and swarming, squeaking rats. He also shares a firm belief that great drum sounds come from everywhere. On ""1685/Bach"", for instance, they come from the peeling of masking tape and jingling change.</p>
<p>This magpie ear for odd, leftfield sounds is <i>Drift</i>'s most explicit link to glitch-hop. The endlessly pinging synthesizer on ""Light #1"" seems to careen off every available surface, while it's companion ""Light #2"" builds from a prism of <i>Tron</i>-like laser blurts. Chung clearly relishes a good rug-pulling, and he plays a thousand little tricks on your senses throughout the record-- breathing sounds fluttering high in the mix, echoing, hall-of-mirrors synthesizers. Occasionally, things get a little too lava-lamp; I wouldn't want to listen to ""Coat of Arms"" while stoned, as I think the halting strobe-light effect might make me seasick.</p>
<p>Chung is clearly also fascinated by darkness and impenetrability, and <i>Drift </i>is filled with nighttime sounds. The brief moments of light, when they penetrate, feel slightly unreal; the woozy major chords of ""2222"" sound submerged, an impression reinforced by the sucking sounds surrounding them, similar to the noises you hear in your ears as you swim for the surface of a pool. At the two-minute mark in ""Light #1"" synths streak across the track like shafts of sunlight, and on ""Lords"", the final track, we're surprised by the late entrance of a rarely heard sound on the LP-- harmonized human voices, relatively untouched by filtering and effects, cooing wordlessly. It's a last dose of cold water to the face on a record full of such moments. There are sonic Easter Eggs for a thousand listens here, and it would take six pairs of headphones and an equal number of high-grade strains of weed to track them all down. Happy hunting.</p></div>"|13251.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13251-drift/|7.9|Jayson Greene

Certainly that much is true for the best of them; as for the recent avalanche of also-rans, the tightrope walk between craft and crunch tends to leave one wanting for more of both. So what's to be done with a band like Psychedelic Horseshit, who've got little interest in pop of any sort, who make their extraneous noise out of necessity rather than some aesthetic choice, and who, through their limited recording budgets and less than sophisticated songwriting prowess, are kind of not a lot of fun to listen to?</p>
<p>En route to their forthcoming sophomore full-length <i>Too Many Hits</i> (this seems unlikely), Psychedelic Horseshit have dropped a few curios that explain this band's unique, er, appeal: <i>Golden Oldies</i>, a collection of CD-Rs and other small-batch material that predates their 2007 LP debut <i>Magic Flowers Droned</i>, and <i>Shitgaze Anthems</i>, a collection of would-be B-sides from the aforementioned <i>Hits</i> LP. Placed in order, one can see something like progress in Psychedelic Horseshit's sound: <i>Oldies</i> is especially turgid and tune-averse, <i>Magic Flowers</i> adds a lot of dynamism to the thick-as-a-brick mix, and <i>Anthems</i> is a little longer and more carefully wrought (though even here, there's still plenty of 'tude and not a lot of what most folks consider hooks). Even at their most braying, there's something to Psychedelic Horseshit's songs. When so moved, they can juice the lo-fi production aesthetic into something far less brittle and caged-in than that qualifier often signifies, and Matt Whitehurst's misanthropy (anyone who's heard <i>Magic Flowers Droned</i>'s ""New Wave Hippies"" in concert knows that whole Wavves-bashing incident was hardly isolated) does make for some amusing phrasings. But you could wait roughly forever for maybe 80% of the songs to all of a sudden appear out of the ether here; confident as they are in their slack, stoney, surf-and-mod-tinged no wave, one gets the feeling some of that confidence lies in a belief that almost nobody is going to listen to this weird music beyond the dudes making it and a few passing burnouts.</p>
<p>Certainly that much seems true of <i>Golden Oldies</i>, which makes it tough to recommend. These aren't quite demos, but as songs, they're half-baked at best, half-formed at worst. It's awfully long, lacks cohesion by design, and finds a skronky, idiot-savanty band at their loudest and dumbest. <i>Oldies </i>is not the best introduction to their work, but it is perhaps the finest microcosm of their charm. Of the 20 tracks, you could count on one hand the number you'll remember even after a dozen listens. The chronologically arranged set gets less dunderheaded and more tuneful as it plays, and once you get around to the <i>Summertime Suicide</i> EP-- with its appropriately sunny ""Anxiety of Influence"" and true shitgaze anthem ""Nothing Is New""-- you do start to see a band worth giving a damn about emerging, even if you're not having much fun in the discovery. Psychedelic Horseshit at times recall the early Pavement singles later collected on <i>Westing (By Musket and Sextant)</i>-- snide charm and crappy sound figure heavily into the success of both. And, like <i>Westing</i>, you're better off listening to <i>Oldies</i> in their original EP-size chunks. This much scuzz at once, coupled with Matt Whitehurst's oft-impenetrable but generally downtrodden lyrics, can be too much bum-out for a single sitting.</p>
<p>The snide charm thing's still very much the thing on the six songs that make up <i>Shitgaze Anthems</i>; the first song is called ""We're Pink Floyd, Bitch"", which, even with the spacey keyboard lick around the chorus, they are <i>so</i> not. But the song-to-skronk ratio strongly favors the former, the sound occasionally veers into the middle-fi, and the tunes typically don't just go from noisy to noisier as they do on <i>Oldies</i>; if you don't find yourself pumping your fist to the chugging X-like intro of ""Dreadlock Paranoia"", you might just find yourself nodding your head to the dub that closes out the track, and that the song spans genres should tell you what you need to know about the progress that's been made between discs. Sure, in the band's past work there are hints of the twangy, stoney rave-up of ""Are You on Glass"" and the can't-believe-I'm-calling-this-gorgeous 5 a.m. balladry of ""As In Dreams Pt. 2"". But never before have so many of their good ideas worked out quite so well. It's still squelchy, uncompromising, uneven music, still not quite meeting the ""pop"" part of ""noise-pop"" halfway, but these are far better songs for them to squelch over, and far more vibrant squelching is taking place here. <i>Shitgaze </i>is not exactly brilliant, and it's still far from what most people consider fun listening. But if these truly are the cast-offs from the next full-length, well, <i>Too Many Hits</i> might have a couple, actually. Fun remains to be seen.</p></div>"|13310.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13310-golden-oldies-shitgaze-anthems/|5.2|Paul Thompson

Placed in order, one can see something like progress in Psychedelic Horseshit's sound: <i>Oldies</i> is especially turgid and tune-averse, <i>Magic Flowers</i> adds a lot of dynamism to the thick-as-a-brick mix, and <i>Anthems</i> is a little longer and more carefully wrought (though even here, there's still plenty of 'tude and not a lot of what most folks consider hooks). Even at their most braying, there's something to Psychedelic Horseshit's songs. When so moved, they can juice the lo-fi production aesthetic into something far less brittle and caged-in than that qualifier often signifies, and Matt Whitehurst's misanthropy (anyone who's heard <i>Magic Flowers Droned</i>'s ""New Wave Hippies"" in concert knows that whole Wavves-bashing incident was hardly isolated) does make for some amusing phrasings. But you could wait roughly forever for maybe 80% of the songs to all of a sudden appear out of the ether here; confident as they are in their slack, stoney, surf-and-mod-tinged no wave, one gets the feeling some of that confidence lies in a belief that almost nobody is going to listen to this weird music beyond the dudes making it and a few passing burnouts.</p>
<p>Certainly that much seems true of <i>Golden Oldies</i>, which makes it tough to recommend. These aren't quite demos, but as songs, they're half-baked at best, half-formed at worst. It's awfully long, lacks cohesion by design, and finds a skronky, idiot-savanty band at their loudest and dumbest. <i>Oldies </i>is not the best introduction to their work, but it is perhaps the finest microcosm of their charm. Of the 20 tracks, you could count on one hand the number you'll remember even after a dozen listens. The chronologically arranged set gets less dunderheaded and more tuneful as it plays, and once you get around to the <i>Summertime Suicide</i> EP-- with its appropriately sunny ""Anxiety of Influence"" and true shitgaze anthem ""Nothing Is New""-- you do start to see a band worth giving a damn about emerging, even if you're not having much fun in the discovery. Psychedelic Horseshit at times recall the early Pavement singles later collected on <i>Westing (By Musket and Sextant)</i>-- snide charm and crappy sound figure heavily into the success of both. And, like <i>Westing</i>, you're better off listening to <i>Oldies</i> in their original EP-size chunks. This much scuzz at once, coupled with Matt Whitehurst's oft-impenetrable but generally downtrodden lyrics, can be too much bum-out for a single sitting.</p>
<p>The snide charm thing's still very much the thing on the six songs that make up <i>Shitgaze Anthems</i>; the first song is called ""We're Pink Floyd, Bitch"", which, even with the spacey keyboard lick around the chorus, they are <i>so</i> not. But the song-to-skronk ratio strongly favors the former, the sound occasionally veers into the middle-fi, and the tunes typically don't just go from noisy to noisier as they do on <i>Oldies</i>; if you don't find yourself pumping your fist to the chugging X-like intro of ""Dreadlock Paranoia"", you might just find yourself nodding your head to the dub that closes out the track, and that the song spans genres should tell you what you need to know about the progress that's been made between discs. Sure, in the band's past work there are hints of the twangy, stoney rave-up of ""Are You on Glass"" and the can't-believe-I'm-calling-this-gorgeous 5 a.m. balladry of ""As In Dreams Pt. 2"". But never before have so many of their good ideas worked out quite so well. It's still squelchy, uncompromising, uneven music, still not quite meeting the ""pop"" part of ""noise-pop"" halfway, but these are far better songs for them to squelch over, and far more vibrant squelching is taking place here. <i>Shitgaze </i>is not exactly brilliant, and it's still far from what most people consider fun listening. But if these truly are the cast-offs from the next full-length, well, <i>Too Many Hits</i> might have a couple, actually. Fun remains to be seen.</p></div>"|13310.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13310-golden-oldies-shitgaze-anthems/|7.0|Paul Thompson

Next in that line of serious, and seriously emotive, songwriters are the Rural Alberta Advantage. The Toronto-based trio, led by born-and-bred Albertan Nils Edenloff, has created an affecting debut that's full of nostalgic songs about hometowns (hence its title) and heartbreaks, marrying salt-of-the-earth acoustic rock to energetic rhythms and grand orchestral arrangements. Even Edenloff's nasal, impassioned singing and lyricism are practically naked in their straightforward sincerity. <br/> <br/> Though these tracks may be serious in content and delivery-- ""Frank, AB"" even nods to the titular mining town's deadly 1903 landslide-- they are buoyed by majestic arrangements. All 13 songs on  <i> Hometowns </i> are built on a foundation of quirky synthesizers and sober acoustic guitars, but the drums (which are front-and-center in the mix on so many of these songs) sprint with breathless insistence on ""Four Night Rider"", some elegant strings add organic warmth to the skittering rhythmic intensity of ""Don't Haunt This Place"", and the glittery innocence of the acoustic arrangement adds whimsy to the earthy stomp of ""Rush Apart"". The band's theme song, ""The Ballad of the RAA"", combines all these elements for a thumping gem of rich, mournful cello, hopeful glockenspiels, bittersweet synths and even a surprising <i>a cappella</i> moment.<br/> <br/> The lyrics are the plainspoken, wistful longing for the details of small-town life on the prairie. With odes to the night sky as seen from a particular part of Alberta or descriptions of an old apartment, Edenloff mourns for relationships and homes lost or gives voice to the uncertainty one feels when moving on from people or places. Given his reedy tones and preoccupation with the past, it would be easy to compare RAA to Neutral Milk Hotel (the death-haunted lyrics of horn-studded ""Luciana"" make it the track most easily confused for a lost Jeff Mangum opus). But with more intensely vigorous drumming, more obviously personal lyrics, and a more blatant interest in glossy electro-pop, Edenloff's band carves out their own niche. It is one that masterfully blends the masculine and the feminine, the refined and the coarse, the dark and the bright.</p>
<p><i> Hometowns </i> ends with ""In the Summertime"", a solemn ballad (the lone true ballad of the whole collection) of droning organs and heartbeat drum thumps that's one part Postal Service synthesized sentimentality, one part final-merry-go-round-ride-of-the-summer calliope melody. In barely two and a half minutes the trio evokes the serenading cicadas and sticky skin of uncertain but excited young lovers. ""In your summer dress, I was holding you, but you were holding less/ It's not the words, it's the ones you stress/ I love you is I love you, just don't love me less"", sings Edenloff, proving why the Rural Alberta Advantage were known as the best unsigned band in Canada before Saddle Creek snapped them up and re-released this debut. And it's a good thing they did; songs this good deserve to be heard by audiences as large as their sonic scope.</p></div>"|12739.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12739-hometowns/|8.0|Rebecca Raber

After all, what is UK funky other than house music produced by Londoners? Sure, it's house produced by refugees from UK garage and grime looking to have a good time while bringing their sonic and stylistic baggage with them: But, well, so what? It's still just house, isn't it? But UK funky is both ""just house"" in its most conventional sense and also ""other than house"" in pretty much every manner that is worth pursuing. It's house at the point where house becomes rave, R&amp;B, rap, dancehall, soca, and, a lot of the time, just manic percussion. But also, a lot of the time, just house.</p>
<p>All of which makes packaging this emerging genre a difficult proposition: UK Funky is like a magic eye picture, its startling multi-genre topography invisible to the naked eye until you discover, perhaps by accident, the right perspective from which to observe it. For many listeners, myself included, the right perspective was provided by the imposition of the MC. On a good radio set-- mixing fast and loose from one track to next, treating full-blown songs like they're functionalist riddims-- the MC confirms that the closest fit for funky's sensibility is dancehall: hence the obsessive focus on dance crazes, the trash'n'treasure opportunism of its sonic eclecticism, and, most importantly, the unlikely balancing act of its covalent relationship between vocal and groove, mouth and body.</p>
<p>In its overdue attempt to come to grips with UK funky, the Ministry of Sound stable was never going to allow an MC to spoil proceedings, if only because this might alienate listeners expecting a more conventional take on ""funky house."" Partly as a result, this slick 3xCD collection cannot capture the ravey excitement of a the best funky radio shows (so search, if you can, Mak 10 and MC Shantie's set for Deja Vu FM). But these reservations aside, <i>Ministry of Sound Presents the Sound of UK Funky </i>is about as good as anyone reasonably could have hoped.</p>
<p>Well, nearly: the mostly great first disc courtesy of Pioneer can drift into tepid territory at times, keen to remind you
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
of the music's roots in the more polite end of U.S. house. But the second and third discs, mixed by Footloose and Supa D respectively, are mostly spectacular. Of the two, Supa D gets the lion's share of current scene anthems, from Crazy Cousinz's peerless xylophone workout ""Inflation"" to the hyperactive electro-dancehall of Perempay &amp; Dee's ""Buss It"" to the rippling but rough bongo fetishism of Fr3e's ""Tribal Skank"" (spoilt somewhat by the addition of a perfunctory and uninspired vocal). But if Supa D's set is strongest track-for-track, Footloose's set is the more enjoyable by a small margin, perhaps because it edges closer to portraying UK funky in its absolute best light.</p>
<p>Put this down to the irrepressible energy of Footloose's mixing, the way he impatiently jumps from one track to the next, or teases out transitions to create hybrid tracks where competing rhythms jut into one another like rotor blades. It also seems to be mixed slightly faster, giving snare-heavy tunes like Crazy Cousinz's remix of Kid Cudi vs Crookers' ""Day 'N' Nite"" or Tru's remix of Karizma's ""Darqness"" a steroidal muscularity they might lack at a more stately tempo. Funky's stumbling but cheerful rhythms seem primed to soundtrack alcohol consumption rather than drug use, but at their manic best these selections latch onto that fleeting moment at the very beginning of drunkenness, when enthusiasm and adrenalin bring on a rush of energy that's as dangerous as it is enjoyable.</p>
<p>What Footloose and Supa D's sets share is an almost perverse attraction to the genre's extremities: both take a childish delight in jumping from sweet vocal tunes to menacing percussive numbers and back again. So Footloose switches from the hyper-intense rave-soca of his remix of Brasstooth's ""Celebrate Life"" into the slinky Latin swish of Delio D'Cruz vs KCAT's ""Get Off The Wall"", all high-pitched vocals and shiveringly delicate beats, while Supa D overlays the sly R&amp;B of L.A. Cartier's ""Call Me"" with a full minute of overbearing, clanking tribal drums from Bakongo's ""Bambara"".</p>
<p>But UK funky isn't solely about this kind of outer-edge gymnastics. Rounding out Supa D's disc, the driving piano stomp and yearning, ghostly male vocals of Fuzzy Logik's ""The Way You Move"" offer a simple, moving love letter to classicist early house, while closer ""I Feel"" by Nat-Mor is simply timeless, delectable vocal garage, its lush groove and stirring diva chorus temporarily making ""other than house"" seem like a pointless destination. It's not, but UK funky's fetish for transformation isn't pursued at the expense of remembering its origins, and the resulting conflation of past, present, and future offers the best of all possible worlds.</p></div>"|13243.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13243-the-sound-of-uk-funky/|8.0|Tim Finney

For Tibet, who's spent many of the last 30 years pushing against reductive self-definition in Current 93, these two lines might be as close to an artist's statement as we'll ever get.  Tibet has long written from the troubled threshold between his mind and God, juxtaposing images of himself as a heretic and an acolyte while sorting through interpretations of Christianity, mysticism, the occult, and the inane. In Tibet's gnostic vision, none of us-- God included-- is perfect or beyond reproach, so Current 93's oeuvre serves as a tool for self-flagellation and self-assessment. On his 1992 masterpiece, <i>Thunder Perfect Mind</i>, Tibet suggested that, ""In the dark, you must look in your heart."" With <i>Aleph</i>, Tibet-- a devout Christian who reads the Bible in Greek and occasionally writes and sings in the ancient Coptic language-- recognizes his troubles in another moment of solitary desolation. This time, he's asking for help.</p>
<p>Behooving a sinner, Tibet's rarely been alone for his most personal explorations: From Antony Hegarty and Ben Chasny to sound artist Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson and Nurse with Wound's Steven Stapleton, he's amassed a revolving army to provide sounds worthy of such intimate and existential conflicts. <i>Aleph</i> is a charging, rock'n'roll appraisal of Tibet's central concern-- living with respect to himself and to God-- supported by one of the best casts yet. Stapleton, improvisational drummer Alex Neilson, Chavez's Matt Sweeney, and harpist Baby Dee return, along with Andrew W.K., Rickie Lee Jones, guitarists James Blackshaw and Keith Wood, and the artistically ambitious porn star Sasha Grey. Carefully orchestrated beneath Tibet's uncanny voice, they create not only Current 93's most rock-oriented album to date but also a fine, fitting crown for Tibet's prolific decade. A surprisingly tuneful, consistently compelling mix of industrial stomp and folk grace, <i>Aleph</i> offers both a career-spanning capitulation for newcomers and a bold push forward for zealots.</p>
<p>As with most of Current 93's albums, specifically 2006's sprawling, apocalyptic dream-state manifesto, <i>Black Ships Ate the Sky</i>, <i>Aleph</i> is a concept album of connected scenes and themes. At its center stands an exploration of the archetypes we often reduce into binaries-- good and evil, dark and light, God and Satan. <i>Aleph</i>, the murderer, and Adam, Eden's original innocent, personify the warring factions of Tibet's mind. Instead of opposites, he makes them equals, where the existence of one implies the other: ""Almost in the beginning was the murderer,"" two children chant by way of introduction, Tibet reverting to his decades-old trope of letting the most innocent of babes reveal the most difficult of truths. Purity doesn't last long, and anything less would be unbearable, the album posits. For instance, during its triumph, ""Not Because the Fox Barks"", <i>Aleph</i> has given into goodness and is ""creating starlings with brightness."" Bored and brooding, he hates it. Tibet understands: ""This is Terminal Eden/ A killer of dreams/ Of hopes/ Of galaxies."" Aleph rages again against Adam.</p>
<p><i>Aleph</i>'s music synthesizes many of Current 93's directions over the last three decades into a potent, relatively lean 54 minutes. In the early 1980s, Tibet emerged from a stint in Psychic TV with a handful of audacious industrial albums, in particular 1984's <i>Dogs Blood Rising</i>. Though certainly not formless, <i>Rising</i> bent barbaric howls and noise floods into long tracks that treated traditional song structure and quiet as anathema. In the late 80s, inspired by a nascent interest in English folk, Tibet shifted to vaguely song-oriented music written largely for acoustic instruments. Aside from various electronic pieces (see the excellent <i>Faust</i> and <i>I Have a Special Plan for This World</i>) and several heavy exceptions, Tibet's long kept his intensity but foregone the early cacophony. But <i>Aleph</i> unites those extremes imaginatively, plating rather pretty arrangements with slabs of distortion. Serrated drones slowly overrun the 12-string Blackshaw array that opens ""Poppyskins"", while blades of cello knife through the lumbering metal of ""On Docetic Mountain"". Drummer Neilson bridges both aesthetics, pushing the songs forward but complicating with nuance. It's arguably the most populist music Tibet's ever made.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no amount of explanation or influence can move many beyond the hurdles of Tibet's chilling voice or his earnest quest for religious revelation. And, sure, Tibet can sound like the Devil himself, and any lyricist that's as wont to reference Reese Witherspoon or Tupperware as he is to recite scripture or quote in Coptic is bound to frustrate the majority. Perhaps the rising stars of writers like the Hold Steady's Craig Finn or Destroyer's Dan Bejar-- both wild-voiced poets who compose in hypertext, connecting ideas across multiple releases while incorporating rapacious literary minds-- have expanded our collective interest in singers who sound like no one else and write with something bigger in mind than the next hook. If so, David Tibet's got approximately 50 records waiting in his back catalog, with the latest-- the excellent <i>Aleph</i> <i>at Hallucinatory Mountain</i>-- suggesting he's still a long way from the Omega.</p></div>"|13108.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13108-anok-pe-aleph-at-hallucinatory-mountain/|8.2|Grayson Haver Currin

Their <i>Wake Up! </i>LP scored them a couple of hits, but it's the previous record, <i>Giant Steps</i> that really showed Carr's incredible scope as a writer. He could do catchy blasts of sunshine, dub freakouts, noise opuses, straight-ahead rock, and intentional kitsch with equal aplomb.</p>
<p>His solo career after the band split in 1999, carried out primarily under the stage name Brave Captain, has embraced a similar eclecticism-- Carr's last album under that name, the 2006 free download <i>Distractions</i>, was loaded with electronic textures and even some decent rap courtesy of Akira the Don. His first album under his given name is more of a back-to-basics thing. It's as friendly as <i>Wake Up! </i>and the Boo's <i>Kingsize</i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">, but also more stripped down and intimate. It could just be that Carr is writing these songs for himself to sing-- he wrote songs for Sice Rowbottom to sing with the Radleys, and though they have similar-sounding voices, Sice was more at home belting and yelping, while Carr prefers a very English sort of understatement.</span></p>
<p>Opener ""The Dead of Winter"" could be a leftover from Carr's mid-90s heyday-- it sounds familiar the second time you hear it, like it's been with you for years. It features a tumbling vocal melody, blasting horn theme, frantic drums and nasty guitar break that keeps you guessing which sides Carr is going to show on the rest of the record. Mostly, he shows his quiet side on brooding songs such as the dark, undulating ""Tired, Broken, Black and Blue"" and the slow crawl ""Pontcanna Stone"", where he gets in a haunting lead guitar part that drifts through the song as though some part of it were smoldering, giving off waves of heat. The album's six-minute centerpiece, ""Goldrush '49"", is built up from a few simple acoustic guitar phrases to a long, stretched-out chant of nothing but the word ""California"".</p>
<p>Carr can still deploy an easy melodicism seemingly at will, as the late-album duo ""Orpheus Lament"" and ""Running"" demonstrate. He gives one of the best songs to his wife, Mary, to sing. ""Why You Gotta Bring Me All This Rain?"" is one of those awesome, miserable British slow songs that inevitably makes you feel better about things after listening to it. Though it lacks the conscious ambition and open challenge of his best work, <i>Ye Gods (And Little Fishes)</i> is still a very pleasing album, and Carr is way past the point where he needs to open up a bag of tricks to make impressive music. If you and Carr last communicated when he was still a Boo Radley, this might be a good time to get re-acquainted, and if you've followed the Brave Captain through every stage of his voyage, you'll certainly want to take this opportunity to get to know him on a more personal level.</p></div>"|13265.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13265-ye-gods-and-little-fishes/|7.1|Joe Tangari

The post-rave cultural context that made his 1999 record <i>Play</i> a worldwide smash feels more distant than ever, but Moby has yet to stop reliably cranking out a new LP every few years. (<i>Wait For Me</i> is actually his second in the last two.) This consistency makes you assume that <i>somebody's</i> still anticipating the latest post-chill out communique from the world of Richard Melville Hall. His U.S. sales may have slipped from multi-platinum to gold to satisfactory, but that just means Moby's able to provide his core listenership with exactly what they want.</p>
<p>Coming so soon after <i>Last Night</i>-- the 2008 ""return"" to high-energy electronic dance from an artist who's never been fully committed to either fast tempos or pure disco-- <i>Wait For Me</i> is more in line with the soft-focus alt-rock of 2005's <i>Hotel</i>, itself taking off from the singer-songwritery side of <i>Play</i><i> and </i><i>18</i>, with blessedly fewer turns from the man himself at the mic. Perhaps he realized his shoegaze-lite stabs at semi-pop songwriting are better suited to wispy lady vocals than his own everyvegan monotone mumble, because there are plenty of tracks on <i>Wait For Me</i> that feature generic, feathery coos.</p>
<p><i>Wait For Me</i> shuffles through two decades' worth of records from the sections of Moby's collection marked ""easy-listening indie rock"" and ""easy-listening dance music"": bedroom-friendly sorta-techno that's like a low-fat version of prog house's voluptuous synths (""Walk With Me"") and portentous string arrangements (""Division""); vaguely post-punk influenced songwriting, like Joy Division with all the menace and weight scraped away until nothing but a vague, twangy ennui remains (""Mistake""); instrumental miniatures like Satie shoved into 90s ambient dress (""JLTF 1""); and ethereal textures out the wazoo. (And of course, being a post-<i>Play</i> Moby album, the prerequisite breakbeat-plus-bluesy-African-American-sample track, ""Study War"".) It's all very beautiful in places, but the kind of beauty that's next to impossible to dredge from your memory even a few minutes after track 16 winds down.</p>
<p>Again and again, <i>Wait For Me</i> offers some truly gorgeous <i>sounds</i>-- the guy who worked wonders with the ""Twin Peaks"" theme all those years ago hasn't lost his way with a shivery snatch of pseudo-melody-- with very little bothering to tie them together into anything like <i>songs</i>, unless unwavering stoner-tempo beat counts. <i>Wait For Me</i> is an exceptionally pleasant album, which is in no way intended to be sarcastic. It just never strives to be anything more than prettified soundtrack-in-waiting stuff, lacking the memorable-on-the-first-listen hooks (M83) or over the top grandeur (Sigur Rós) of other acts who've explored similar sounds in the last 10 years. And even as ambient, or new age nostalgia, it lacks the textural richness that inspires listeners to repeatedly dive into such seemingly ""static"" discographies as Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project.</p>
<p>For those outside the Moby cult, <i>Wait For Me</i> is background music in the purest sense, an album of mood-buoying sketches best suited to provide color to otherwise bland scenes (working, studying, waiting on the phone with the cable company, getting your hair did, etc.) from your daily life. It's too listenable overall to be outright dismissed as some sort of flop. But it's too willfully unobtrusive and happy with its lack of ambition to try and sell as good pop, even in a year thin on the mediocre kind.</p></div>"|13245.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13245-wait-for-me/|5.4|Jess Harvell

About half the verses on the album come not from Wu members but from fellow <span class=""misspell"">Carhartt</span>-era rap vets like Sean Price and <span class=""misspell"">Cormega.</span> I guess <i>Old 90s Rap Dudes Chamber Music</i> didn't have the same ring. There's no Method Man, no <span class=""misspell"">GZA</span>. <span class=""misspell"">RZA</span> doesn't produce any beats, though we do hear his voice over and over. Second: <i>Wu-Tang Chamber Music</i> is only barely an album. Of the 17 tracks on the CD, only eight are actual songs; the rest are strictly interstitial pieces, <span class=""misspell"">kung</span>-<span class=""misspell"">fu</span> movie samples, or bits of marble-mouthed mythology already familiar to anyone who read <i>The Wu-Tang Manual</i>. <br/><br/>And make no mistake: People who read <i>The Wu-Tang Manual</i> are definitely the target audience here. The mere existence of this LP has a weird late-90s quality to it; it's a throwback to the time when record-store shelves were crammed with with albums by vaguely Wu-affiliated crews like <span class=""misspell"">Killarmy</span> and <span class=""misspell"">Sunz</span> of Man, when labels would rush out any old crap they could slap that W logo on. A decade on, it's oddly comforting that a label would aim for your Wu-Tang consumer dollar even when that dollar barely exists anymore. <br/><br/>But if <i>Wu-Tang Chamber Music</i> is a hackneyed cash-grab, it's a pretty good hackneyed cash grab. Because once you get past the brevity and the non-<span class=""misspell"">Wuness</span> of it all, there is some beautifully executed <span class=""misspell"">hardhead</span> grown-folks rap shit on here. The music comes from the Brooklyn soul band the Revelations, who do live-band rap music as well as just about anyone, which is to say that you can't tell you're hearing a live band most of the time. There's an organic old-soul crackle to the incendiary trumpet-bursts on ""Sound the Horns"" or the slow-rolling <span class=""misspell"">bassline</span> on ""Ill Figures"", but that warmth is the sort of warmth that the better East Coast producers can get out of old records. And so credit might be due to Fizzy <span class=""misspell"">Womack</span>, otherwise known as M.O.P.'s Lil Fame, probably the best <span class=""misspell"">beatmaker</span> currently working the underground NYC circuit. Fizzy co-produced every actual song on the album, and these tracks have a hard-hitting simplicity that probably serves a quickie all-posse album like this one better than <span class=""misspell"">RZA's</span> choked paranoia would. And because the Revelations play music even during the interludes, those bits never fuck up the flow of the album.<br/><br/>And it certainly helps that most of the craggy veterans here, Wu and otherwise, go in hard on this thing. Most of these songs don't have actual choruses, so gnarled shit-talk is the focus here, and the assembled old gods still do it well. On ""Ill Figures"", <span class=""misspell"">Kool</span> G Rap does twisted-up, <span class=""misspell"">lispy</span>, half-off-beat gun-talk so well that you'd probably guess he'd been doing it for decades even if you didn't know. <span class=""misspell"">Inspectah</span> Deck, on ""Sound the Horns"", comes with easily one of the top five C. Thomas Howell name-checks I've ever heard on a rap song: ""The sound of the horns says it's on / We storm through like C. Thomas, <i>Red Dawn</i>."" (""P. <span class=""misspell"">Swayze</span>"" would've fit in just as well there, but Deck never goes the obvious route.) <span class=""misspell"">Cormega</span> remains one of the only rappers who can get away with a line about ""lyrical elevation causes mental stimulation"" because he throws that in the middle of a verse so jammed with internal rhymes and left turns (""this is a lyrical aqueduct""?) that you only barely notice. Even <span class=""misspell"">RZA</span>, never a great rapper, comes with at least one hot line: ""My moms put gunpowder inside my <span class=""misspell"">Similac</span>.""<br/><br/>And in his three appearances here, <span class=""misspell"">Ghostface</span> <span class=""misspell"">Killah</span> maintains his status as Wu-Tang's MVP, ranting about the <span class=""misspell"">shrooms</span> on his tour rider on ""Harbor Masters"" or kicking unbelievably <span class=""misspell"">badass</span> warnings on ""Evil Deeds"": ""Don't <i>ever</i> come at me sideways, hands in ya pocket/ <span class=""misspell"">Cuz</span> I will turn to Steven <span class=""misspell"">Seagal</span>, rip ya <i>arm</i> out ya <i>socket</i>."" But <span class=""misspell"">Ghostface's</span> highlight, and the album's, comes on ""I Wish You Were Here"", the one moment of tenderness in the midst of all those <span class=""misspell"">boxcutter</span> threats. Over a slow, quavery soul-jam beat, Ghost bleats out one of those emotive sex-rap verses that he does better than anyone else before ceding the spotlight to a raspy old-school soul clinic from singer <span class=""misspell"">Tre</span> Williams, who comes off like Gerald Alston on <i>8 Diagrams</i>' ""Stick Me for My Riches"".<br/><br/>So, OK, the various rappers here can lay on the get-off-my-lawn stuff a little thick. (Topics railed against include Hot 97's Summer Jam, skinny jeans, Twitter, and the ever-popular ""<span class=""misspell"">ringtone</span> rappers"".) And there's really no compelling reason for this LP to exist beyond these guys' desire to remind us that they're alive. But I haven't heard an album full of anachronistic tough-guy stuff this satisfying in a long time. The world may have moved on to songs with the word ""swag"" in the title, but these guys are still out there, spitting grown-man <span class=""misspell"">gangsterisms</span> to anyone who will listen. I call that nobility.</p></div>"|13242.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13242-wu-tang-chamber-music-vol-1/|7.5|Tom Breihan

<p class=""MsoNormal"">In the late 1980s, the members of Uncle Tupelo were checking out the entire country and folk sections from their local library and passing them around like bootlegs, which exposed them to many of the artists and styles that would inform their sound.<span> </span>A few of the records they cite as inspirations-- including 1975's <i>High Atmosphere: Ballads and Banjo Tunes from Virginia and North Carolina</i>-- were compiled and released on Rounder Records, which at one time specialized more in old acts than new. It's not especially surprising that Son Volt, Jay Farrar's post-Tupelo band, have finally signed with the venerable label, placing them alongside acts as diverse as Nanci Griffith, Rhonda Vincent, and Farrar's hero Woody Guthrie.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That might sound like a circle finally completed if Farrar sounded today as galvanized as he did 20 years ago. Son Volt's label debut, <i>American Central Dust,</i> is some of the sleepiest protest music ever made: Every song saunters by at a slow tempo, Farrar's voice sounds increasingly inexpressive, and John Agnello's production makes everything sound real purdy but lifeless. Of course Farrar is never going to rock out again-- and the muddy electric guitars on the 25-mph ""When the Wheels Don't Move"" doesn't count-- but this folksier sound he has settled into during this decade rarely works up a sweat or even rouses you from a light doze.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">His deep, commanding voice-- perhaps one of the most imitated sounds of the alt-country movement-- has mellowed considerably over the years, such that at times he sounds a little wooden and disengaged. Occasionally he'll hit a high note (""Roll On"") or sustain a syllable into a strange vocal buzz (""Down to the Wire""), <span> </span>but he can't sell his sympathy for Keith Richards on ""Cocaine and Ashes"" or work up much bluster on ""Pushed Too Far"". Lyrically, these songs prove slightly more straightforward and coherent than much of his '00s output, but even this directness sounds like an effort. On ""Sultana"", about the steamboat that exploded near Memphis in 1865, he approaches the history lessons with dry matter-of-factness and clunky phrasing that's made all the more egregious by the absence of details or point. ""The worst American disaster on water,"" he sings. ""The Titanic of the cold Mississippi was the Sultana.""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">For the most part, however, Farrar's subject matter is much more contemporary. As always, he's concerned with social injustice, corporate manipulation, job loss, the little guy vs. the fat cats, but in recent years his lyrics have tended toward the poetical and cryptic, dulling the sharp edges of his outrage. Perhaps it all goes back to those Rounder comps: As he has aged, Farrar has grown increasingly reverent toward his source material, learning his entire moral code-- at least the one expressed in his music-- from the singers of coal-mining and union songs. They are undeniably great and knowledgeable teachers, yet his faith in them has become not simply unshakable, but unexamined and unquestioned. His outrage once took instrumental form-- in the roar of guitars and the boom of that voice-- but now the music feels safe and deferential. Dissent can sound quiet or twangy or even laidback, but it should never sound so compulsory.</p>

But just because it's not surprising doesn't mean it's not appealing. With songs that marry tough riffs to tender glockenspiels and find a balance between muscular, masculine drumming and singer Adam Thompson’s vulnerable, striving warble, there is much to like within <i>These Four Walls</i>.</p>
<p>Discovered by the label thanks to Frightened Rabbit's MySpace page, We Were Promised Jetpacks are destined for comparison to that band of brothers. It's not just that their accents sound the same-- though, Americans take note, the Jetpacks are from Edinburgh and the Rabbits from Glasgow. Both bands traffic in rousing, emotive guitar pop driven by thundering drumming, though Frightened Rabbit come at it from an acoustic angle and are obsessed with the heaviness of the kick drum, while WWPJ come from a post-punk place where every 4/4 rhythm is punctuated with cymbal 16th notes. And Scotland must really be chilly because both bands are preoccupied with maintaining heat. FR, on their last album, admitted that ""it takes more than fucking someone to keep yourself warm,"" a theme that appeared on more than just the track called ""Keep Yourself Warm"". While, coincidentally, WWPJ's best song is ""Keeping Warm"", a more-than-eight-minute track that spends half of its run time as an instrumental-- spackling glockenspiels, guitars, and what sounds like a saxophone over its increasingly galloping rhythm-- and the other lamenting the loneliness of life. <br/><br/>Perhaps there is something about a thick Scottish accent that allows us to indulge in grandiose emotional sentiments. If an American band gave us a track like ""It's Thunder and It's Lightening"", with its earnestly soaring melody that explodes out from an insistent strum, it would come off as gratingly emo. But swaddled in glottal stops and guttural consonants, the dramatic changes in dynamic feel earned and the sensitive lyrics feel roguishly honest. Maybe that's also due to the hugeness of WWPJ's drum sound-- maybe it's easier to be sincere without sounding like a pussy when backed by such rumbling, macho percussion? Though ""Quiet Little Voices"" feels a bit like Bloc Party with a brogue, thanks to the clinical skitter of its cymbal-heavy attack, ""Short Bursts"", which sounds like it was recorded in an echo-y cave, is fast and messy with all of its other elements racing to keep up with its tribal pounding.  <br/><br/>Because the intensity of their rhythmic assault can become tiring, We Were Promised Jetpacks smartly break things up with songs such as the spacey, drumless instrumental interlude ""A Half-Built House"" and the hushed, finger-picked album closer ""An Almighty Thud"" (though some of the more introspective tracks, like ""This Is My House, This Is My Home"", are a little too soppily ""Grey's Anatomy""-ready). But their best songs are still the barnburners. <br/><br/>While they can teeter on the verge of being too angsty or overindulgent-- a fault not aided by Thompson's penchant for repeating one dramatic line over and over again-- We Were Promised Jetpacks were built for speed. And thanks to the taut grooves of a tight rhythm section, they sound better the faster they play. They don't have the lyrical complexity of the bands that they will be compared to (from a young U2 to the aforementioned Frightened Rabbit), but they do have the energy and that's a promising place to start.</p></div>"|13136.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13136-these-four-walls/|6.7|Rebecca Raber

It doesn't downplay Kate Simko's considerable talents to say that she was born to make this score, although perhaps you could say that of any techno producer as steeped in ambient and modernist music as she. <i>Music From the Atom Smashers</i> simply gives her a template on which to do what she does: one that nudges her away from crisp dancefloor fare like ""She Said"", toward the mysterious realms of Steve Reich, Wolfgang Voigt, and Brian Eno.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In fact, almost half of the album expires before we hear the first real house track, ""God Particle"". This is the particle for which the physicists are searching, and appropriately, the song seethes on the verge of an epiphany, with a melodic feeling of anticipation and bass so elastic it seems to be trying to mutter a revelation. Only ""Sociber"", an intestinal tunnel with drums that whiz and ping, similarly threatens to move your body. On most of the album, Simko is instead more interested in moving your space-time continuum. It would be tautological to call this ""pattern music,"" but it's certainly pattern-conscious. Outside of the dance tracks and the anomalous but excellent ""The Creative Part"", a Philip Glass-indebted composition for burnished ostinatos and piano sunbursts, Simko works in layered pulses, like she’s breaking billiards racks in slow motion. She makes you feel the weave, not the line.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">A number of recurring motifs betray the record's soundtrack status: skittering palpitations, sifting shards of broken china, cosmic slide-whistles, shamanistic rattles, and striated rumbles roughing up bloops, snaps, crackles, and pops. A lot of Rice Krispies, to be sure, but Simko remembers to cut in plenty of fruit: warm blurs of melodica on the splintering dirge ""Quiet Daydream"", lingering symphonic chords on ""Nature Surreal"". More interesting than the sounds themselves are the intelligence and sensitivity of their deployment, the constant attention to weight, color, and direction. You never get the feeling that Simko cued up a few devices, hit record, and kicked back with a crossword puzzle. She hovers over the album, alert and meticulous, fitting a bass line with anti-gravity boots here, skewing the angle of a comet's tail there. As a result, the repetitive nature of the sounds subsides from your attention, as you marvel about how they penetrate sonic spaces you couldn't perceive until they were filled.</p></div>"|13137.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13137-music-from-the-atom-smashers/|7.5|Brian Howe

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Given their vast and varied catalog, it's sometimes easier to imagine R.E.M. as a discography than to picture them as a flesh-and-blood band. Ironically, it may be R.E.M.'s insistence upon operating as a fully democratic entity that has allowed them to shapeshift so completely and convincingly. Whether crafting a subdued folk song or an over-the-top glam rock stomper, R.E.M. have always embraced their chosen approach completely, even if it means former drummer Bill Berry laying low for an acoustic number or singer Michael Stipe handing off a lead vocal to bassist Mike Mills.<span> </span>On their sophomore LP, <i>Reckoning</i><span>, those polymorphous tendencies find root as palpable, electrifying, yet-unexplored potential. And with this aptly named reissue, </span><i>Reckoning</i><span> finally gets the ""Deluxe"" treatment (and much-needed remaster) that it deserves.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This comes as no surprise; the ""Deluxe"" reissue of the band's debut full-length, <i>Murmur,</i><span> was revelatory, breathing astonishing new life into a 25-five-year-old album. <span><span>Greg Calbi's expert remastering job cleaned up the album's notoriously murky sonics and revealed previously unheard detail and force.  This newfound clarity made <i>Murmur</i> seem much more purposeful, lifting the proverbial veil on an album made by record nerds who understood the common ground between the Soft Boys, Gang of Four, and the Velvet Underground</span></span>. </span><i>Reckoning </i><span>couples the energy of </span><i>Murmur</i><span> with the experience of a group that has spent a few years touring and recording, documenting that crucial moment when a band's ideas and ambitions are overtaken by the unique chemistry of its players.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Finally, with this remaster, ""Harborcoat"" makes for a fittingly explosive opener. Many of the best songs on <i>Reckoning</i><span> follow the formula set forth on this debut track: a methodical verse followed by a sly turnaround into a cathartic chorus. Bill Berry's drum parts are at times virtually indistinguishable from song to song, and Michael Stipe tends to sing verses and choruses in the same respective registers. But </span><i>Reckoning </i><span>is far from formulaic-- instead, it is host to a kind of determined minimalism, each song building via subtle variations in performance and instrumentation. ""Discipline"" is not a word that gets thrown around a lot when discussing rock music, but it is key to </span><i>Reckoning</i><span>'s success.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Case in point: As with countless songs written before and after it, ""So. Central Rain"" takes up the simple phrase ""I'm sorry"" as its chorus. But the combination of Stipe's strong-yet-unmistakably-fragile voice, Berry's nervous drumming, and the melodic interplay of Mills' bass and Peter Buck's guitar imbue these well-worn words with remarkable force and meaning. For all the arty, pretentious gestures the band was given to, <i>Reckoning</i><span> shows that they were not afraid to embrace the universal, to transfigure clichés rather than ham-fistedly avoiding them (see also ""Everybody Hurts"").</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As with its predecessor, <i>Reckoning</i><span> finds R.E.M. touching upon different styles while working within a fairly consistent aesthetic. The latter half v</span><span>eers a bit towards Americana, without sacrificing any of the momentum built over the album's stunning opening tracks. Slight embellishments go a long way towards highlighting the band's versatility-- a propulsive piano line in ""(Don't Go Back to) Rockville"" elevates the homespun whimsy of Stipe's voice, and hand percussion on ""Time After Time (Annelise)"" hints at the more understated turn the band would take with </span><i>Fables of the Reconstruction</i><span>.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The live disc included in this reissue (a 1984 performance at Chicago's Aragon Ballroom) demonstrates how well these songs work without any such production flourishes. While the raw energy of the live show included in the <i>Murmur</i><span> reissue is toned down a bit, it is fascinating to hear the band grow more sure-footed in both performance and arrangements. It is also interesting to hear how the band's live approach seems to have been absorbed back into their studio recordings; Stipe's trademark live vocal tics are present throughout </span><i>Reckoning</i><span>.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Declaring <i>Reckoning</i><span> to be R.E.M.'s ""best"" album sells short just how many different </span><i>kinds</i><span> of great albums R.E.M. have released. But, more so than any other R.E.M. record, </span><i>Reckoning</i><span> is unified and energized by the very restlessness that has driven the band to explore so many different ideas and identities. It is this paradoxical engine of transparency and mystery that has made the band so unique, regardless of the particular approach they choose to take for a given record. Any way you look at it, </span><i>this</i><span> is R.E.M.</span></p>

Yet once I start to gain a real feel for the band, I don't get the sense, as I do with many of their contemporaries, that they're merely reverent pastiche artists. Oh, there's plenty about their latest album <i>Fits</i> that pulls from the past-- the blistering fury of Love's ""7 and 7 Is"" is an obvious touchstone; the Doors' lusty freak-bliss pops up often. But at the same time, the band's choice of name and its aesthetic penchant for surface-level representation makes me think that, far from flipping through back issues of <i>Creem</i> for inspiration, they situate themselves in a nostalgia-for-the-present feedback loop.</p>
<p>Still, the first thing listeners will notice about White Denim is the way they switch sounds so abruptly: In opener ""Radio Milk How Can You Stand It"", the first two-thirds of the song is standard White Denim-- bass that sounds like it's reverberating from underground, percussion that chatters like wind-up plastic teeth, James Petralli's squawk mirrored by chippy, dirty guitars. Then after a millisecond pause, drums lock with guitar, a skronky sax appears, and Petralli's register shifts to a bluesy howl. The song, still satisfying and surprising on the 10th listen as on the first, could have been drawn from the catalog of any number of psych-based power trios, but it's executed well and makes for a great opener. More often, however, <i>Fits </i>features hippie paeans like ""Mirrored and Reverse"", bearing a wispy semi-refrain that suggests the Byrds' <i>Fifth Dimension</i>, without bringing much more to the table than atmosphere.</p>
<p>For all the moments <i>Fits</i> locks in and finds a groove strong enough to hang a hook on, it more often slides right past, on some sort of restless vision quest for something it's bound not to find. First single ""I Start to Run"" sounds like the Red Hot Chili Peppers circa <i>Mother's Milk</i> (there, I said it), and if they want to grind out propulsive, gonzo funk pastiche that's okay with me. It's when the group hints at something bigger and grander without manifesting something out of their ambitions, like on the album's last two songs, ""Regina Holding Hands"" and ""Syncn"", that I stop paying attention and instead start anticipating their next EP. ""Regina"" dispenses with any timbre resembling ""honk"" or ""slap,"" substituting strummy acoustic guitar and a bluesy wail. ""Syncn"" ends the record on an even breezier note, Petralli's vocals holding in a creaky upper register that makes him sound like Devendra Banhart.</p>
<p>Incendiary live shows, sure, but White Denim are a product of the Internet, first and foremost. And their path has taken the sort of weird turns that one might expect for a band seeking to distinguish itself in a virtual market where seemingly everything's already been done. Their first EP was promising, to say the least, and since then they've released two very similar ""follow-ups"", <i>Exposion</i> and <i>Workout Holiday</i>, one in the U.S. and one in Europe, which folded those songs in with a bunch of others that failed to pack as much of a punch. And so <i>Fits</i> feels like the band's formal first LP-- lots of what makes them unique, and then those somewhat awkward ""growth"" points. That initial itchiness, in other words, never really goes away.</p></div>"|13119.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13119-fits/|7.0|Eric Harvey

<p class=""MsoNormal"">It's not like there's ever a bad time for Dead Prez to return to the scene, but with their own DJ Lantern-helmed mixtape, a lack of any label constraints, and white people in power fucking up even more than usual, 2009 just feels like the right time for a reintroduction.<span> </span>But ""Don't Hate My Grind"" featuring Bun B…I mean, ""Hip-Hop"" initially tricked you into thinking that these guys might have been a Dirty South act at the get-go, but is that what they've actually grown into?<span> </span>Sort of.<span> </span>Turns out Young Jeezy was on to something with <i>The Recession</i>, employing a Obama-derived power of positivty within an easily understood, catch-all framework in which concerns of the everyday street hustle can be addressed.<span> </span>""My grind's my stimulus plan,"" M-1 spits at the end of ""The $timulus Plan"" and it functions as something of a thesis for <i>Pulse of the People--</i> ""grind"" gets employed with a frequency that rivals <i>Let's Get Free</i>'s use of the word ""exploit<i>.</i>""</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That's not as much of a 180 as it sounds, since ideals of self-reliance and community empowerment have always been a part of the Dead Prez ethos.<span> </span><i>Pulse </i>follows suit, dealing less with dubious conspiracy theorizing and Molotov recipes and instead painting characters with broader strokes-- the young, erudite revolutionary-in-training (""Runnin' Wild""), the ethically admirable street soldier (""Gangsta, Gangster""), the anti-authoritarian (""Warpath"").</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>As with their previous work, it can be difficult to figure out whether to evaluate the message independent of the actual <i>music</i>.<span> </span>It's a thankless task to find fault with a song that endorses donating to clothing drives and mentoring the young, but ""Helpful"" doesn't offer much beyond PSA, being the rare point on <i>Pulse </i>where Dead Prez's unfortunate love for sickly neo-soul hooks manifests itself.<span> </span>""Afrika Hot!"" welds surf-guitar to a get-buck, native tongue chant in the most sonically exciting track, but otherwise, DJ Lantern collects a gaggle of beats all generically synthy and bass-heavy enough to delude itself into Hot 97 rotation; ""Refuse to Lose"" masters the obvious with its sample and I keep on waiting Ron Browz to show up at some point in ""Gangsta, Gangster"". Exponentially more difficult to explain is ""My Dirty Valentine"", a hair-pulling, ass-slapping, freek'n you sex jam that's could only be more out of character if it featured Vampire Weekend.<span> </span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>By a pretty large margin, <i>Pulse of the People </i>is the most feel-good record in Dead Prez's discography, whether due to its eco-friendly packaging or that ""Summer Time"" leaves open the possibility that these guys know how to have fun (though wooing with cabernet and a musical gets perilously close to ""futon""/""croutons"" territory).<span> </span>But then again, you almost miss how their earlier work left it up to the listener to determine whether Dead Prez were looking to educate or entertain when they advocated robbing pizza deliverymen or the idea that the only thing that made them angrier than white people are white people bumping ""Hip-Hop"" and ignoring, say, ""Police State"".<span> </span><i>Pulse of the People </i>finds a pleasant middle ground between those two posts, but listening to Big Apple big-ups like ""NYPD"", I just hope that Dead Prez aren't expecting to find soldiers for their revolution in the XXL Bangers comments section.<span> </span><span> </span></span></p></div>"|13260.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13260-pulse-of-the-people/|6.6|Ian Cohen

The chugging, scrappy, Velvets-indebted aesthetic is so finely woven into ""classic"" indie rock's DNA (thanks largely to 90s uber-fans like Pavement and Superchunk), that it's easy to take a new album from one of the key Kiwi bands for granted-- even to write it off as quaint and anachronistic.</p>
<p>So inevitably, nostalgia nags <i>The Guilty Office</i>, the Bats' first release since 2005's <i>At the National Grid</i>, their respectable but underwhelming return from a decade-long hiatus. Despite introducing a few upgrades over the years-- actual sound engineering, a greater vocal role for guitarist Kaye Woodard, and the occasional harp-- the band hasn't tinkered with its signature chiming guitars and surging straight-ahead rhythms. But why fix a formula that works? From melodic, bobbing lead ""Countersign"" to bucolic closer ""The Orchard"", <i>Office</i> is a comfortable, comforting listen, wonderful in its very familiarity.</p>
<p>Even as the band sticks to the path of least resistance, it skirts the MOR sandtrap that sinks so many indie rock acts that manage to last a quarter century. The Bats' feet aren't as fleet as they used to be; nothing on <i>Office</i> hurtles with the reckless abandon of classics ""United Airways"" or ""The Law of Things"", and there's a higher ratio of slow-to-fast tempoed songs than there used to be. But a tune like ""Crimson Enemy"" locks into enthusiastic, even danceable grooves. And although lead Bat Robert Scott has always harbored a hint of despair in his almost-comic frog-throated croak, he's positively ebullient dueting with Woodard on ""Steppin' Out"". Even on less-sunny songs like the title track or ""Broken Path"", the dude sounds like he's smiling, like he's (get this!) happy to be there.</p>
<p>The record's midsection is a tad soft and somewhat skippable. I'm a sucker for a good ending, though, and orchestra-enhanced ""The Orchard"" is a knock-out, as pretty and plush as a middle-period Belle and Sebastian track, with a unison-sung chorus that suggests the whole room, including the sound guys, are chiming in on ""here we go a-wassailing around the apple trees again."" Charmingly giddy as that is, you actually have to return to track one, ""Countersign"", for the album's essential lyric: ""We want you back here/ You've been too long away."" Agreed.</p></div>"|13122.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13122-the-guilty-office/|7.5|Amy Granzin

That time period spans an inexact period of my life-- likely yours as well-- but holds plenty of importance for the members of the Guelph, Ontario, country-rockers Royal City. It covers the lifetime of a band that, along with the Constantines, helped spark an uptick in early 2000s Canadian indie in Guelph and Toronto.</p>
<p>Royal City have the profile of a pressurized, scene-making band of ruffians: fervent collaborators, singer Aaron Riches was a prominent figure in Guelph's punk scene, while Jim Guthrie was an already established singer/guitarist. But the band's records, including 2001 pinnacle <i>Alone at the Microphone</i>, showcase a band whose finest quality was restraint. Royal City songs shuffle along, augmented by slight country signifiers, by Guthrie's exacting guitar curls and Riches' modest poetry. So the cover of Iggy Pop's tongue-in-cheek ""Here Comes Success"" that begins <i>Royal City</i>-- as well as the animal howls of ""In the Autumn"", the harder-edged version of <i>Alone</i> opener ""Bad Luck""-- represent a figurative letting down of hair for young men who'd always acted beyond their age.</p>
<p>A handful of tracks here suggest Royal City had more to give: ""Postcards"" is a slyly clanging, imagistic epic, the type of statement song their albums often lacked. ""O You With Your Skirt"" is flirty and engaged, its reserved lust the perfect soundtrack to your next afternoon spent sundress-gazing. ""A Belly Was Made for Wine"" recalls Uncle Tupelo in its tight melodic phrasing; ""Dog Song"" is sweet and literal (""He's a very very very nice dog/Even though he barks"").</p>
<p><i>Royal City</i> doesn't imply progression, though: its tracks are not sequenced chronologically (in fact, it's not close: the compilation is bookended by the only two tracks recorded in 2001, for example), and the highlights listed above are scattered through the band's six years. So the proceeding is not one of mourning what might've been but simply pleasant recollection. If you're a fan, it will allow you to mostly forgive the undercooked acoustic demos (""Can't You Hear Me Calling"", ""I Called But You Were Sleeping"") or retreads (an early version of ""Bad Luck"" offers little insight and no improvement) and revel in details like the kazoo solo during ""Here Comes Success"" (ushered in: ""Here comes kazooooo!""), the self-referential chorus of ""In the Autumn"" (""C-I-T-Y/ Royal city""), and the band's sleepytime cover of the Strokes' ""Is This It"".</p>
<p>For a band of Royal City's profile, as scene-makers, as brief collaborators with artists like Feist and Owen Pallett (Final Fantasy), as a young band that started local (on Guelph-based Three Gut Records) and found believers (their final two albums landed on Rough Trade, and <i>Royal City</i> arrives in gorgeous, bound packaging from Asthmatic Kitty), this set lacks a little bit of fire. But it remains pretty true to Royal City's reputation as talented, smart artists who, probably deservedly, remained on the periphery of the Canadian indie rock explosion.</p></div>"|13132.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13132-royal-city/|6.7|Andrew Gaerig

At least according to Diplo and Switch, the producers behind the Major Lazer project and its debut LP, <i>Guns Don't Kill People-- Lazers Do</i>.  Why Diplo and Switch (known to your parents in film trailer-speak as ""the guys behind 'Paper Planes""') decided to create the unnecessary backstory is a mystery. If it's just to have a little fun, to put together some sort of <i>Super Ape</i>-like cover art, hey fine; if it's in any way about the fact that a white American and a white Brit are here making a dancehall record...this is really an issue?</p>
<p>It feels like it is, in some circles anyway. But the musical dialogue between Jamaica and the U.S. has been strong ever since New Orleans jazz and American R&amp;B began to reach the island via radio, mixing there with calypso, nyahbingi, and other African and Caribbean sounds. In the time since, resourceful Jamaican producers have borrowed from and tweaked soul, Afropop, disco, electro, hip-hop, and more, and the U.S. and UK gave us, uh, Sublime and the Police. (OK, and the Slits, the Pop Group, the Clash, etc., etc.) Plus, you know, there's this whole globalization thing. If it's your first experience with Jamaican music (tsk, tsk), the variety on hand here should help dispel the myth that dancehall or any other Jamaican sound is monosyllabic. (If you need further proof, Soul Jazz's <i>Dynamite!</i> series is a great place for the uninitiated to start...try <i>200%</i> and <i>300%</i> first.)</p>
<p>But if you're bugging out over the whole authenticity thing for some reason, Diplo and Switch have lined up a who's-who of Jamaican vocalists: Vybz Kartel, T.O.K., Ms. Thing, Turbulence, Mr. Vegas, Mr. Lexx, and more. Wisely though, they still know their probable audience (i.e. hipsters) and kick this off with ""Hold the Line"", a song featuring Santigold. (the CD case calls the song ""I'll Make Ya"", but some discs have been printed with a sticker letting us know the
<script src=""http://pitchfork.com/media/backend/js/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js"" type=""text/javascript""></script>
song is indeed called ""Hold the Line"", as already indicated from mp3 tags, MySpace streams, and its music video.)</p>
<p>Whatever you want to call it, with its rumbling bass, ""A Milli""-like vocal hook, and spaghetti western atmospherics, it's a hell of a way to kick off the solid-to-killer six-song stretch that opens the album. Well paced and immaculately produced, the first half-dozen <i>Guns</i> songs nicely move between the past 30 years of Jamaican music, from the sweet ""Can't Stop Now"" [ft. Mr. Vegas and Jovi Rockwell], which recalls the rocksteady-indebted, pre-digital  sounds of 80s dancehall, to the politically charged ""Anything Goes"" [ft. Turbulence], steeped in modern ragga and the give-and-take between the island's music and American hip-hop, particularly that from the post-Cash Money South.</p>
<p>The record derails in the middle, and no points for guessing where based on the tracklisting. ""Mary Jane"" is the requisite weed song, and sadly it's played off as a sniggering novelty, making it both obvious and annoying. (Major Lazer do humor much better later, taking the Baby T-Pain meme and turning it into a clever skit.) There's also a song featuring Amanda Blank, ""What U Like"", that's of course a minimalist electro track full of boilerplate sex talk. (Einstein asks the appropriately named Blank if she likes it when badman fucks her, etc.; Blank says yes, actually, I do.)</p>
<p>The rest of the back of the album, despite not having the awesome ebb and flow of the first half, features some of its heaviest hitters: Vybz Kartel and T.O.K. (with a return appearance by Ms. Thing) show up and kill on ""Pon de Floor"" and the Man Parrish-sampling ""Bruk Out"", respectively. And closer ""Jump Up"", with co-production from Crookers (of ""Day 'N' Nite"" remix fame) would be the perfect<i> au couran</i>t dancefloor filler if it weren't for the record's weird trojan horse: ""Keep It Goin' Louder"" [ft. Nina Sky and Ricky Blaze].</p>
<p>So, yeah, buried deep into Diplo and Switch's dancehall record, they went and hid one of the best pop songs of the year. Let's not declare death of Auto-Tune quite yet-- if this thing could get a foothold on the Hot 97s and B96s across the country it would deservedly shoot up the charts. With about three ridiculous hooks, ""Louder"" serves as a nice calling card for Diplo and Switch as crossover producers and a reminder that Nina Sky are weirdly underutilized.</p>
<p>Five years after teaming with M.I.A. for the <i>Piracy Funds Terrorism</i> mix and making his excursions to favela funk balls in Brazil, Diplo seems oddly underespected these days. Perhaps it's because he's a better DJ and producer than remixer-- and in the immediate aftermath of his rise to fame, it was a remixer that he got his most work. Perhaps it's because to either those who want pop/youth culture to be somehow segregated-- or to those who believe <i>they've</i> graduated from collegiate suburban solipsism into something more open-eared and less purely straight and white, yet still remain suspicious of other white kids who also enjoy disco/hip-hop/dancehall/pop-- he's an easy go-to negative representation of young white urbanites and their encroaching interest in global black culture (which, historically, is the definition of hipsterdom right there).</p>
<p>Whatever the case, he and Switch are kicking off summer with an armful of perfect cookout-, top down-ready songs, like the daytime soundtrack equivalent of all of the summertime night's rooftop music that's been coming from Swedes Air France and the Tough Alliance and their new wave of American indie disciples, such as Real Estate and Memory Cassette in the past year-plus. Best to enjoy it now, even though it will still also sound great in six months.</p></div>"|13236.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13236-guns-dont-kill-people-lazers-do/|8.1|Scott Plagenhoef

As Kelly Louise Carter noted in <i>Vibe</i>'s article ""The Battle for J Dilla's Legacy,""<i> </i>when A Tribe Called Quest's <i>Beats, Rhymes and Life </i>got nominated for a Grammy, Q-Tip practically had to badger him into even going to the award ceremony. By that time, Jay Dee had already put his signature on three of my favorite hip-hop tracks of the mid-1990s-- the Pharcyde's ""Runnin'"", De La Soul's ""Stakes Is High"", and Tribe's ""Stressed Out""-- but since he was still kind of an unknown quantity, I had no idea he'd had a hand in producing them. Even the encyclopedic <i>Ego Trip's Book of Rap Lists</i>, published right before the 90s ended, doesn't mention him, unless you count two Ummah remixes listed under ""Q-Tip's Notable Non-A Tribe Called Quest Productions.""</p>
<p>That would've been a great time to release something like the two volumes in the <i>Dillanthology </i>series-- when he had a rich enough body of work to justify them, but still had the kind of relative anonymity that would make it revelatory. Instead, what we get with these two compilations-- one volume of original productions, one of Dilla-orchestrated remixes-- is a selection of damn good songs, and not enough of them.

2009 is an undertaking that'll only lead to loose ends and missing pieces.</p>
<p><i>Volume 1</i> is typical of that quandary, where pretty much everything is great but you're left wondering why there's only 13 tracks on a disc that has room for another 25 minutes' worth. So you get ""Runnin'"" and ""Stakes Is High"", but no ""Stressed Out""-- no Ummah-driven Tribe at all, actually, which could be due to the Best Of's eternal hitch of rights issues. At least there's still enough star power to exhibit how wide his reach was: the first seven tracks go Pharcyde-Slum Village-Common-Badu-De La-Busta-Roots, which covers nearly every important collaborator from 95 through 2000 and balances well between the iconic (Common's sing-along classic ""The Light"") and the left-field (""Show Me What You Got"", in which the world learned that Busta sounded ill over Stereolab loops). A few later-period cuts like the heat-sizzle synth throb of A.G.'s ""Hip Hop Quotable"" and Steve Spacek's borderline-avant-garde soul-drone single ""Dollar"" round things out, but it's still the Cliff's Notes version of a sprawling career: here's the classic stuff where he did soul-jazz beats with immaculate drums and beautiful, pulsing bass, now here's a couple of his grimier/stranger early-mid-aughts stuff, now sort it all out.</p>
<p>If you really want to get some illumination, the remix-centered Volume 2 is more essential by dint of this stuff being less familiar and often harder to find. By sticking mostly to Jay Dee's work through 2000 it feels more declamatory of a specific style: almost entirely late-90s/Ummah-era, where he had his work cut out for him revamping big hits but still found a way to lend his signature style to contexts where it really shone. Much of it consists of solid alternate takes of stuff he'd already produced (including a more heavy-funk take on ""Stakes Is High"" with new verses from Mos Def and Truth Enola), but there's other nuggets like the unreleased remixes of Masta Ace's ""Sittin' on Chrome"" and the Artifacts' ""The Ultimate"" that make this volume essential. The latter-period stuff shines, too, especially the 2003 remix of Four Tet's ""As Serious as Your Life"" (featuring a super-bugged-out watery guitar loop and verses from Guilty Simpson) and a hazy 2004 mutation of Brother Jack McDuff's ""Oblighetto"" that turns his organ-driven ""Scenario"" source into a netherwordly ether frolic.</p>
<p>But, inevitably, it leaves you wanting more, preferably from a source that's willing to go as deep as possi

ble. A prolific body of work like Dilla's demands a box set at least the size of one of the <i>Complete Motown Singles </i>volumes, not just a two-disc series that spans less than two hours.

<p><i>Volume 1</i> is typical of that quandary, where pretty much everything is great but you're left wondering why there's only 13 tracks on a disc that has room for another 25 minutes' worth. So you get ""Runnin'"" and ""Stakes Is High"", but no ""Stressed Out""-- no Ummah-driven Tribe at all, actually, which could be due to the Best Of's eternal hitch of rights issues. At least there's still enough star power to exhibit how wide his reach was: the first seven tracks go Pharcyde-Slum Village-Common-Badu-De La-Busta-Roots, which covers nearly every important collaborator from 95 through 2000 and balances well between the iconic (Common's sing-along classic ""The Light"") and the left-field (""Show Me What You Got"", in which the world learned that Busta sounded ill over Stereolab loops). A few later-period cuts like the heat-sizzle synth throb of A.G.'s ""Hip Hop Quotable"" and Steve Spacek's borderline-avant-garde soul-drone single ""Dollar"" round things out, but it's still the Cliff's Notes version of a sprawling career: here's the classic stuff where he did soul-jazz beats with immaculate drums and beautiful, pulsing bass, now here's a couple of his grimier/stranger early-mid-aughts stuff, now sort it all out.</p>
<p>If you really want to get some illumination, the remix-centered Volume 2 is more essential by dint of this stuff being less familiar and often harder to find. By sticking mostly to Jay Dee's work through 2000 it feels more declamatory of a specific style: almost entirely late-90s/Ummah-era, where he had his work cut out for him revamping big hits but still found a way to lend his signature style to contexts where it really shone. Much of it consists of solid alternate takes of stuff he'd already produced (including a more heavy-funk take on ""Stakes Is High"" with new verses from Mos Def and Truth Enola), but there's other nuggets like the unreleased remixes of Masta Ace's ""Sittin' on Chrome"" and the Artifacts' ""The Ultimate"" that make this volume essential. The latter-period stuff shines, too, especially the 2003 remix of Four Tet's ""As Serious as Your Life"" (featuring a super-bugged-out watery guitar loop and verses from Guilty Simpson) and a hazy 2004 mutation of Brother Jack McDuff's ""Oblighetto"" that turns his organ-driven ""Scenario"" source into a netherwordly ether frolic.</p>
<p>But, inevitably, it leaves you wanting more, preferably from a source that's willing to go as deep as possi

ble. A prolific body of work like Dilla's demands a box set at least the size of one of the <i>Complete Motown Singles </i>volumes, not just a two-disc series that spans less than two hours.

Here, on Street Sweeper Social Club's self-titled debut, the ball's shifted more into Morello's court, with funky, though fairly minimal rap-rock. Granted, this album falls into a formula that's instantly recognizable the moment you hear it, for which Morello deserves credit; but with Street Sweeper Social Club, Morello is part of a backing band (and, in pulling double-duty on bass for the record, <i>is</i> most of the backing band), ready for an assertive, engaging personality to take them to the next level.</p>
<p>Enter Boots Riley. On paper, he should be perfect for this: Over his long career as a rapper, there's always been a relatable everyman attitude and a warm generosity behind every political platitude. He might be the world's most lovable self-proclaimed communist. But the man is not himself on this record. ""The Oath"" begins with a surprisingly mellow, bluesy intro where Boots shows off his eye for detail (a broken TV bolted to the wall, a lacquered and carved-up tabletop), but it just leads to more staccato blues riffing and vague fight lyrics with a dog of a chorus. Too often, these songs have direct counterparts to old Coup songs that leave them in the dust. He's singing, ""Fight, Smash, Win,"" as three easy steps to resolution, where just three years ago he was singing, ""Laugh, love, fuck, and drink liquor,"" (from <i>Pick a Bigger Weapon</i>'s ""Laugh/Love/Fuck"")  to achieve the very same thing: Did he think rock kids couldn't relate? Rather than treating the album as an opportunity to find a new audience, Riley writes as if he needs to dumb it down for a different crowd.</p>
<p>Some songs take brief respites from the distinctive formula Morello helped to build, from the aforementioned breakdowns in ""The Oath"" to the strummy opening chords of ""Good Morning, Mrs. Smith"" or the more fluid unaccompanied bass lines of ""Somewhere in the World It's Midnight"". Any and all changeups are welcome, and Riley takes those opportunities to ably switch up his flow. But whether they're riding their comfort zones or pushing themselves, the problem isn't style so much as substance. These are rock anthems, not dissertations; but in keeping things vague and general rather than Riley's normally pointed and specific raps, they rarely approach any kind of relevancy. There are a few exceptions, notably ""Shock You Again"", but as a portrait of a soldier ordered to torture, it falls short of indicting any specific person (or method, given the title), and the less said about the lantern-jawed soldier's accent Riley adopts here the better.</p>
<p>Even as a record of adequate, vaguely politicized mook-rock, it mostly falls flat, whether by lazy lyrics or some uninspired drumming from Galactic's Stanton Moore, who adds plenty of percussive touches like the judicious cowbell of ""Clap For the Killers"" but sinks more straightforward tracks such as ""The Oath"" like a stone. The touring band already has a new drummer, plus a full-time bassist and rhythm guitarist in place; perhaps the debut can be written off as a rehearsal before everyone involved can contribute their all.</p></div>"|13239.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13239-street-sweeper-social-club/|3.9|Jason Crock

For instance, we have seen these elaborate PR tactics before: one man posing, at least in name, as a band, but with studiously guarded anonymity. But the web unearthed a name and pieced together a back-story, and Mike Sniper has been outed as the mastermind behind the project. A walking Wikipedia of music arcana, he played guitar in the New Jersey punk outfit D.C. Snipers, hawks rarities at the Academy Annex record shop in Williamsburg, hand-crafts gig posters and t-shirts, and set up both the power-pop-reissue label Radio Heartbeat and, more recently, the Captured Tracks imprint. His art has colonized every corner of his life. For anyone tempted to paint Sniper as a bandwagon-jumper, chasing some kind of hipper-than-thou low fidelity trend, one glance at this CV would straighten them out.</p>
<p>Mysterious, minimalist, alive to antecedents, Sniper's way of advertising himself mirrors his way of expressing himself. Again, there's a faint illusion of laziness. But it's the appearance of a narrow palette and recycled template-- the jog tempo, meekly mechanized drums, tin and treble, voices a room or two down the hallway-- that hides a more complicated reality. As Sniper himself told <i>The Fader</i>: ""I have these visions sometimes of writing songs that sound like Jeff Lynne or the Move, but it still comes out sounding like some blown out Factory Records demo."" But <i>Under and Under</i> dispatches the charge of repetition and ""samey"" songcraft very quickly. Track two, ""L Machine"", flies far off course, continents away from Robert Smith's private property, to land somewhere in Cabaret Voltaire's jungled, more treacherous terrain. While the simplicity of the album opener is preserved-- the guitar's three notes are taken over by the keyboard-- a crude, anxious vision of the future emerges. Howls of electronic static, hissing and beeping like signals intercepted by satellites, vie not only with a spirited acoustic strum, but explosions of broken glass. The startling blend suggests a close encounter of the third kind, followed by a sloshed bonfire. Another brilliant departure comes late in the record, in the aptly named ""Slowing Down"": the song decelerates from <i>Under and Under</i>'s usual cruising speed, without sacrificing the project's love of disorder. Even at slower tempos, he pairs echoing guitars with slashing sounds and a chaotic hook, perhaps a decayed ode to decayed love.</p>
<p>Weighed against the well-received <i>On Two Sides</i>, released by Troubleman Limited, Blank Dogs' second full-length is more colorfully composed, without straying too far from Brooklyn's increasingly popular ragged-reverb aesthetic. Admirers of Crystal Stilts and Vivian Girls, in particular, will already have a soft spot for Sniper's particular flavor of pop deconstruction. (As of 2008, you can even call them labelmates: the recent Blank Dogs EP <i>The Fields</i> was released by Jeremy Earl's Woodsist Records.) Where Vivian Girls sand their sharp, discordant edges with harmonies, and where Crystal Stilts shower rain over sun-kissed 1960s pop, Sniper veers off in a different direction. There's a temptation to slander these family resemblances as hipster herd thinking; given the obvious sense of community across labels like In the Red, HoZac, Art Fag, of like-spirited musicians collaborating and ideas cross-pollinating, the truth is brighter. The emotions, of course, are darker. In <i>Under and Under</i>, especially, today connects to yesterday through Sniper's abiding love for the overcast moods of post-punk and the gloomier regions of new wave.</p>
<p>The struggle to squeeze Blank Dogs into a genre is important to his project-- maybe not to the artist, but certainly to the listener: meaning can be found in each hint of music history, real or imagined. Post-punk's memorial to blighted industry is fittingly evoked here. The Blank Dogs aesthetic, and that of the larger low-fi movement, gracefully soundtracks our moment, as a kind of comment on technology's rising tide capsizing all boats. ""Setting Fire to Your House"" captures the present malaise, expertly pitched between menace and innocence. Like Sniper's earlier ""Leaving the Light On"", the song sinks a charismatic chorus into an enveloping melancholy. It is worth comparing his treated voice to a more famous manipulator. About T-Pain's reliance on Auto-Tune, <i>The New Yorker</i>'s Sasha Frere-Jones noted: ""His vocal hooks sound delirious, not desperate."" By shrouding or drowning-- the goth atmosphere demands morbid verbs-- his voice in reverb and distortion, Sniper aligns himself firmly on the side of desperation. The giddy delirium, on the other hand, is the province of the keyboards, which have the whiny timbre of a children's toy, or a campy Theremin, in the moan and sigh of solitary notes. Chords would have been too delightfully unified to capture recession-era fragment and isolation.</p>
<p>New wave, which came to describe the groomed and well-behaved child of punk, is no less relevant: Sniper makes use of the style's bittersweet melodies, but muddies them to oblivion, pulling them back closer to the raw emotional punch of punk. The patina of fuzz brings to mind garage rock and gauzy shoegaze (or is that fuzz really Psychedelic Fur?), while others spot goth, all suggesting amped-up arrangements of manic-depressive lyrics. Sure enough, Sniper captures the translucent train-through-fog chug of the Jesus and Mary Chain (""The New Things""), the garbled gloom of Red Lorry Yellow Lorry (""Open Shut""), and the space-age detachment of Soft Cell's <i>Mutant Moments</i> EP. But how can one man call to mind so many styles without sinking into incoherence? The key lies in the tunes' blurry shapelessness, the sense that we're apprehending something through squinted eyes or a Vaseline-splotched lens, and that a kind of Rorschach-blot logic of projecting and imagining takes over.

Aside from the fact that the group insists on pronouncing it ""Double 'U' Double 'V' Double 'W'...'Z'"" rather than the more intuitive and percussive ""You You Vee Vee Double-You Double-You Zee,"" it is actually a pretty cool name, at least in the sense that it gives few hints of what to expect from the music. In a field overcrowded with horrendous band names running the gamut from the deliberately obnoxious (Battlehooch) to the painfully pretentious (the Spiritual Machine), UUVVWWZ's moniker does not immediately indicate the musicians' worst impulses, and it has a welcome ring of enigmatic eccentricity. Even if it is needlessly difficult to pronounce, the name invites the listener to figure it out, and wonder what the band is all about.</p>
<p>So yes, the big question: What is UUVVWWZ all about? Judging by the sound of their debut album, it seems as though they are still working that out. They certainly have an aesthetic in mind: Loose yet tense, arty yet accessible, epic but not ponderous. The nine songs on the record happen to be the group's first nine completed compositions, and so while many of the tracks have the thrilling buzz of inspiration and discovery, it is also apparent that they're casting about in search of an identity. This is not to say that the songs lack character. The band's best asset is Teal Gardner, a singer blessed with a strong, distinct voice that's compelling even when it comes too close to emulating other vocalists. This is most evident on the album's spazzy rockers, which have the manic chirpiness of Deerhoof and Ponytail, but also the more populist tunefulness of early Yeah Yeah Yeahs. ""Jap Dad"" is the best of these songs, but as much as that number is charmingly bratty, it comes off more like the band are having a good time than being entirely themselves.</p>
<p>The quieter tracks on the record feel much more natural and relaxed. The opener, ""Berry Can"", shifts between a sweet, girlish vocal from Gardner and a dark, menacing riff that breaks into the song like an unexpected thunderstorm on an otherwise sunny afternoon. ""Neolaño"" and ""The Sun"" flirt with outright bluesiness, which encourages Gardner to play up the more bold and womanly aspects of her voice. ""Castle"", the album's centerpiece and best song, falls perfectly at the center of the group's aesthetic spectrum. As the music floats between moments of dreaminess, turbulence, and catharsis, Gardner's performance is similarly mercurial. For the most part, her emoting matches the sound of the band, but her inflections and cadences are often surprising and vaguely counter-intuitive. She is a revelation on this track, seamlessly transitioning between fragility and intensity, and investing her entirely inscrutable lyrics with a convincing urgency. The band would be wise to continue on the path laid out by this song. Clearly, this is Gardner at her most confident and affecting, but it's also the band's most dynamic moment, and allows them to move between a lovely, unapologetically pretty groove and an appealing heaviness. There are plenty of signs that UUVVWWZ are on track to become a better band, but ""Castle"" is the song that will make you impatient for them to hurry up and get to their next level right away.</p></div>"|13250.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13250-uuvvwwz/|6.6|Matthew Perpetua

Sample its rhythmic-centric, post-emo art-rock, and decide if you need to continue through the band's catalog. It only gets less user-friendly from there.</p>
<p>Because (speaking to the first-time listeners) ""rhythm-centric"" here doesn't mean anything remotely funky. It means the frantic, percussion-heavy, multiple-tempo-shifts-per-song brand of complexity inaugurated by batshit 70s-era theatrical hard rock. Also, the band's allegiance to jazz-fusion titans, ones not averse to fuzz and a low-end, means things get far...looser from album number two onward. Arena-grade heavy metal thunder abruptly melts into a groovily aimless journey for congas and electric organ. Repeatedly. Immodestly virtuosic and never afraid to run with a jam, the Mars Volta's ability to alienate newcomers is well-documented. Which means this review is probably for those not already-- or instantly, after their first listen-- alienated.</p>
<p>Is <i>Octahedron</i> the band's best album? No, but if you dig on MV's unrepentantly ""big"" and meandering suite-driven concept-album thing, you won't necessarily be disappointed. And with songs that only once stray past the eight-minute mark, it's the most accessible MV album since the first. Slower, with fewer breakdowns or out-of-nowhere segues into a wholly new song, it's kind of a Cliffs Notes of everything the band does well, ditching much of the attention-straining stuff. For instance, the hallucinogen-friendly stretches, where glassily effected guitars ping and peal at lava-lamp tempo, have been pruned. (Okay, with a few exceptions.) Even the longest songs stick to something like a coherent mood and linear structure.</p>
<p>Sometimes they even straight-up rock. ""Cotopaxi"" is perhaps the tersest, most jagged song Omar Rodriguez-López and Cedric Bixler-Zavala have cut since At the Drive-In imploded, a boogie riff nodding to their Texan origins, violently cut up and reassembled with virtuoso care. ""Desperate Graves"" actually <i>builds</i>, rather than dropping a big loud bomb after a placid bit of introductory strumming, and comes with the closest thing the band's written to an instantly memorable chorus in quite a while. Even the breakdown is short and to the point.</p>
<p>This being the Mars Volta, however, it wouldn't do for the album to be entirely curveball-free. For instance, Autechre-style electronic hisses and bristling beats bubble up in the latter half off ""Copernicus"", mostly without getting all show-offy about it. There's also the general slow and steady downtempo-- or plain downer-- feel to many of the songs. For a band so often pilloried for being too agitated to ride out a good riff, it's probably the closest the Mars Volta will ever come to a cop for the slow jam kids. And it's hard to deny that, depending on your taste for jamming, if you've ever dug on acid-spitting wank-solos over endless, thunderous drum rolls, the final minutes of album closer ""Luciforms"" is pretty much the shit from a shameless climax standpoint.</p>
<p>As for Bixler-Zavala's lyrics, well, sure, they still often verge on the eye-rolling if you're not going to meet him halfway. I'm not going to pretend that a line like, ""My devil makes me dream/ Like no other mortal dreams"" comes off to me as anything but camp/kitsch.  And ""don't stop dragging the lake"" (from ""Cotopaxi"") isn't really an earworm as far as hooks go. Now I don't mean to dismiss the words' possible import. It's been clear from album one that the lyrics have a deep resonance for the band, and are meant as clues for the kind of fanbase who enjoys treating records as narratives with big gaps waiting to be filled with a little online research/interview legwork/guesswork. While I'm so not that guy, I will just say the melodrama-rich, scrambled poetry-notebook puzzle pieces do ""work"" in the context of the album's overall sound. So does the horror flick sound of Bixler-Zavala's vocals. When his full-tilt shriek joins the band at a moment of total commotion, you can imagine the planetarium-scale mock grandeur of it all.</p>
<p>The Mars Volta feeds some very specific needs in its fanbase. There's a certain kind of listener that, maybe once a year or maybe every day, wants music that sates the same impulse that makes people gorge on spectacle-scale cinema or devour the entire <i>Dune</i> series in a few weeks. The Mars Volta's specific brand of bombast may remain an untranslatable language for those rooted in a DIY-scaled world, or committed to the shiny three-minutes-and-change tidiness of the charts. But if you're fiending for the musical equivalent of an epic, partially incoherent battle between good and evil in IMAX 3D, you could do a lot worse.</p></div>"|13308.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13308-octahedron/|6.0|Jess Harvell

It takes its name from its title track, the stunning, swaggering disco-ish standout that first appeared on the Swedes' sophomore full-length, <i>A Hundred Things That Keep Me Up At Night</i>, and though the EP's five other songs are all new B-sides, they don't sound like leftovers. In fact, the EP's main fault is that it's too short; these five new songs deserve to be paired with another five on a full-length. With each subsequent effort Love Is All refine their sound, and <i>Last Choice</i> suggests their best work could actually be yet to come. Though they started as spazzy noisniks who joyously shouted and pounded so loudly that it was often hard to hear the ""pop"" in their heavily rhythmic pop anthems, on <i>A Hundred Things</i> they exerted more control over their delightfully messy sonics and placed greater emphasis on their wonderfully descriptive and direct lyrics.</p>
<p>With their mastery of richly detailed yet simple storytelling, Love Is All offer lyrics that crackle with added resonance. Often overshadowed by the spastic din of her bandmates, singer Josephine Olausson's warbled words now have the space to be heard. So though the title track will immediately win listeners over with its glammy, steel drums-like keyboard intro and a plinky, sax-studded melodic interlude ripped from Bruce Springsteen's ""Rosalita"", it will earn repeated plays with its straightforward depiction of the kind of end-of-the-party loneliness that leads one to go home with their ""Last Choice"": ""The same song is on repeat, something inappropriately upbeat/ And now people leave hand-in-hand, as if according to some mysterious plan/ I'm about to be left alone, I'm sitting on the sofa on my own.""</p>
<p>Olausson has intermittent regard for pop rhyme schemes and seems to care even less if her chosen words fit into the music's allotted space, either hurrying over syllables or drawing them out over extra beats. But her off-kilter delivery-- with its emphasis on her hard Scandinavian ""r""s, babydoll-voiced run-on sentences, and explosive caterwaul-- adds character to her distinctive, first-person narratives. Who knows if the songs on <i>Last Choice</i> are autobiographical, but Olausson's unselfconscious approach to her subjects-- she often presents them at their worst, most selfish, or loneliest-- makes her a rare vanity-free frontperson. ""Early Warnings"", a Yeah Yeah Yeahs-ish stomp, describes an accident-prone, very bad morning-after. On ""Jealousy"" Olausson takes the guise of a demanding girlfriend having a public fight with her boyfriend, and ""Vans Vans Vans"", which returns to the harder-hitting, fuzzier, more lo-fi aesthetic of Love Is All's first album, recounts unglamorous tales from the road.</p>
<p>If the band believes that their debut was, in fact, nine different versions of the same song (as its title jokingly claimed), then they must be proud of <i>Last Choice</i>'s diversity. They display comfort with jangly, Clean-like pop (as on ""From Your Corner"") and surprising agility with heartbroken, tambourine-aided twee (as on ""Loud Heart""), as well as re-pledging their allegiance to the funky, manic post-punk that they made their name on. This EP may be short-- it's less than 19 minutes-long-- but it makes a very big statement about the future of this Swedish quintet: They've only just begun to show what they can do.</p></div>"|13093.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13093-last-choice-ep/|7.8|Rebecca Raber

And all of it sounds like a painfully dated dispatch from the era of Insane Clown Posse and Marilyn Manson? That Slim Shady: did he buy Cage's tape and dub over it <i>again</i>?</p>
<p>It's a real shame that Cage's latest, <i>Depart From Me</i>, turned out the way it did. His last record, 2005's <i>Hell's Winter</i>, was a harrowing example of emo-rap, a record that transformed the well-rehearsed details of Cage's traumatic life-- violent and heroin-addicted father, abusive stepfather, a history of drug problems and a tortured stint in a mental institution-- into a compelling showcase for the other thing he shares with Eminem: prodigious rapping abilities and a gift for rendering nightmarish scenarios, like the one in which police rip heroin bricks from the floorboards of Cage's home while his father brandishes a gun at him and his mother, with uncomfortably vivid detail.</p>
<p><i>Hell's Winter</i> veered off-course only when Cage indulged his unfortunate weakness for Linkin Park-style emo, like ""Shoot Frank"", which features a  mewling nu-metal hook courtesy Glassjaw lead singer Daryl Palumbo. Sadly, <i>Depart From Me </i>seems to have taken ""Shoot Frank"" as a way forward rather than a dead end, in the process reinforcing the lamentably accurate stereotype of rappers with terrible taste in rock music.  Worse, Cage seems to have bottomed out psychologically again, flipping us off with his deliberate lack of effort: ""I have nothing left to say, I'd like to share it with you/ If you don't care, is it too bad for me or too bad for you?"" goes the chorus to ""Nothing Left to Say"", the first song on the album.</p>
<p>Lyrically, he's still ""cling[ing] to [his] addiction like a kid in swimmies,"" which is fine; if Clipse can spend a career detailing their addiction to pushing dope, Cage can certainly devote as many albums as he wants to his addiction to doing it, but, as Malice and Pusha T are finding out, if you're going to rap about the same thing over and over again, you better damn well be finding new and better ways to say it. And just as there only so many puns you can build around the words ""ki's,"" ""birds,"" and ""snow,"" Cage is running up against the fact that he's already obsessively detailed this stuff-- his addiction, his deadbeat dad-- with more fervor and invention than he ever musters here. ""Beat Kids"" is an almost-complete retread of <i>Hell's Winter</i>'s ""Stripes"", right down to the scenes of his wild-eyed, terrified mother. And as far as drug rhymes go, ""silly habit, drugs are for kids,"" just ain't cutting it.</p>
<p>It might help if Cage spent more than half the album rapping, but mostly, he is trying to make his version of an early-80s hardcore album here, shades of Suicidal Tendencies, Circle Jerks, and Rollins-era Black Flag. His success rate roughly equals that of Andre 3000, trying to make <i>Idlewild</i> OutKast's period-blues album. The NOFX-ishly titled ""Fat Kids Need an Anthem"" sees Cage doing his best impression of Mike Muir's aggrieved-loser narrator on Suicidal Tendencies' ""Institutionalized"", and the song, a frank and refreshingly funny take on his fluctuating weight and self-image problems, is one of the album's few fleeting moments of real wit: ""They say you are what you eat, that means I went from shit to a vegetable! And the worst part about it is, I was happier when I was fat on drugs! I went fantasizing about women to fantasizing about food I can't eat anymore!""  But then the song's chorus-- ""I WAS A FAT GUUUUUUY! I WAS A BIG, FAT GUUUY!"" leaves something to be desired even by the loose standards of 80s punk.</p>
<p>There are one or two moments where Cage manages to bridge the gap between miserable-underground-rapper guy and miserable-suburban-punk-rock guy, and they come when Cage focuses on the kind of small stuff that makes 80s hardcore winning-- girls, mostly, and obnoxious friends asking for too many plus ones at his shows. ""Captain Bumout"", about wanting the club to empty out so you can talk to that one girl, boasts the album's only great, anthemic chorus. But for every one of those, there are three songs like the title track, where Cage spends four minutes throwing withering insults at a girl who dared to leave him when he suffered a mental breakdown. (Clincher line: ""You ruined art for me."" Classy.)  Like the other white rapper he will never escape comparisons to, Cage exhausts the patience of even his faithful followers at times, and <i>Depart From Me</i> almost reads like a plea to whoever might be left checking for him in 2009.</p></div>"|13309.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13309-depart-from-me/|4.7|Jayson Greene

He's published two novels, including a ""cover"" of Thomas Hardy's <i>A Pair of Blues Eyes</i>, and his band Rock Plaza Central's third full-length, <i>Are We Not Horses?</i>, was an odd concept album about mechanical equines who develop their own horsey self-awareness. Even singing, he remains a narrator-- not simply because he's relating connected events, but more crucially because the inflections and expressive accents in his performances suggest a man caterwauling in character. As a songwriter, he creates full mythologies like a Joss Whedon unburdened by the strictures of television, and as a singer, he gives his fantastical characters voice, but it's his band that makes those worlds seem real and relatable. On <i>Horses</i>, they gave his valedictories and conspiracies a soft, elegiac edge, and on their fourth and equally majestic album, they find new ways to illustrate his tales.</p>
<p>Despite that long album title (and what's wrong with such a wordy title?), there is no overarching narrative quite as pronounced as the one that rode <i>Horses</i>. Eaton has said he was inspired by Faulkners' <i>Light in August</i>, but barely any trace of the novel appears in the music. There is a sense of a journey undertaken, battles fought, ideas considered, destinations reached. If that impressionistic tack means <i>At the Moment</i> lacks the full conceptual thrust of its predecessor, it nevertheless feels somewhat more approachable, as if you could put it on shuffle and proceed through this strange world logically. Of course, Rock Plaza Central are no Decemberists: Accessibility is not necessarily their aim, nor is winking literary approximation. With no need to sell their erudition, they are free to rock more freely.</p>
<p>So opener ""Oh I Can"" rises like a zombie out of the silence, with a lumbering tom rhythm, a lurching bassline, and cinematic strings all building into a full chorus. By the end of the song, the band is harmonizing behind Eaton's testifying: ""I could give down and cry,"" he sings, ""but I won't give down and cry."" It's a strong lyrical and vocal hook, but as <i>At the Moment</i> unfolds, it focuses more intently on the music than on Eaton's lyrics, as if only through Blake Howard's galloping drums (his sudden entrance on ""[The World Is] Good Enough"" is one of the album's most energizing moments) and those mournful horns could they ever convey this story.</p>
<p>These songs mark a slightly different direction for the band: They're using pretty much the same arsenal of instruments that colored <i>Are We Not Horses?</i>, but they're deploying them in different ways to make different sounds and play different roles. There's a classic-rock vibe on most of these songs, but especially on ""Holy Rider"" and ""(Don't You Believe the Words of) Handsome Men"", where banjo, violin, and horns execute the pyrotechnics typically reserved for electric guitar. The result is a heavier, denser, ponderous sound that makes <i>At the Moment</i> no mere sequel, but its own sovereign entity.</p>
<p>Contrasting these rock songs are quieter tracks like ""O Lord, How Many Are My Foes?"", which sets Eaton's wartime prayer against minimal accompaniment. A lone trumpet plays an ascending scale like it's ushering his words to God's ears, but a small, curious, arrhythmic percussion (unidentifiable, but it sounds like a pair of woodblocks) keep him tethered to the earth. Instrumentals ""Country C"" and ""The Long Dead March"" further the plot gracefully, and while some classic rock-oriented bands might release guitar albums, <i>At the Moment</i> is perhaps a violin album. Fiona Stewart, who doubles on trombone, switches between lead and rhythm parts fluidly, playing the main riff on ""Holy Rider"", adding a windswept backdrop to ""(The World Is) Good Enough"", and sympathetically shadowing Eaton's vocals on ""Handsome Men"".</p>
<p>""We all love like battalions, we all love with abandon,"" Eaton sings on ""We Are Full of Light (That Blinds Us at the Moment of Our Most Needing)"", as Howard beats out a Dodos-style rhythm. It could be the closer, but it's not-- just more rising action. Rock Plaza Central have a strange destination and a denouement in mind, and the band makes the story sound like it's set in the real world with unbelievably real stakes.</p></div>"|13105.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13105-at-the-moment-of-our-most-needing-or-if-only-they-could-turn-around-they-would-know-they-werent-alone/|8.0|Stephen M.

It's hard to get mad at the fun, shallow <i>Super Animal Brothers III,</i> unless you're the sort of person who's infuriated by neon sunglasses and haphazard leotard combinations on principle, in which case, prepare to get heated. It feels like they'd do better if they dropped the postures and affectations that dilute the album and instead focused on fleshing out their songs, which are sown with the seeds of good ideas.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">From the first sounds you hear-- a pestering alarm and a soupy, panning bass tone-- you know what sort of album it's going to be: puffy-paint party jams à la Dan Deacon, with lots of pixilated analog synth streams, glitchy drum matrices, and faux-kiddy singing about video games, sparkly sweaters, and, I don't know, manatees? You get the impression you aren't really supposed to pay attention to the lyrics. But where Deacon infuses his day-glo riots with brainy intent, EAR PWR recycle the worst tendencies of electroclash: the lackluster rapping and willful inanity. It's frustrating because there's ample evidence that EAR PWR aren't compensating for being shitty at music, they're just dumbing down.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Devin Booze studied in UNC-Asheville's music technology program (founded by Bob Moog), where he learned to build the devices used in EAR PWR's music, and he's quite clever at fitting deranged textures around locomotive rhythms. His sequences are lively, squiggling like chiptune, sashaying like Italo-disco, and singing out like new wave. He makes a synthesizer whiz around like a punctured helium balloon on ""Diamonds Liquor Leather"", fashions a kind of demented Irish reel on ""Secret Stars"", and employs glockenspiels and deformed Boyz II Men samples on ""Boys II Volcanoes"". He likes to cut off his loops at the ankles to create a feeling of choppy, precarious progression rather than fluidity, and this air of haste evokes the album as a whole-- a handful of cool loops welded together doesn't automatically make a memorable song.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Similarly, Sarah Reynolds can sing a nice hook when she cares to. The choruses of ""Future Eyes"" and the title track are earworms; Reynolds could do more with this Belinda Carlisle-meets-M.I.A. shtick. But it's never very long before she's back to stringing together nursery chants, snatches of unmoored melody, general sassy noises, and rudimentary rapping, and the songs dissolve into a mush of mannerisms. Honestly, the deck is stacked against EAR PWR as a recording entity-- their music, focusing on thrill-per-second immediacy and communal ecstasy, is designed for warehouse parties full of sympathetic friends who find your bad rapping cute. Here, they could take a lesson from Deacon: Live, let the id rage, but let your brain do the heavy-lifting when it comes time to make something for those who couldn't make it to the party.</p></div>"|13104.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13104-super-animal-brothers-iii/|5.6|Brian Howe

Miraculously, the disparate strains within the group's catalog have somehow flowed together into a unifying aesthetic, largely due to Jeff Tweedy's distinctive singing voice and remarkable consistency as a songwriter. Though their previous releases, particularly the schizoid <i>A Ghost Is Born</i>, have embraced this eclecticism, the band's seventh proper LP, <i>Wilco (The Album)</i>, does just what the title implies, and consolidates their style into a coherent statement of identity.</p>
<p>This is something of a mixed blessing. Though <i>Wilco (The Album)</i> is a good, concise distillation of the band's strengths, it is not their best work, mainly because it lacks the audacity of their four previous efforts. The group's 2000s output thrived on Tweedy's restlessness and perversity, as if each song were penned in part to challenge the preconceptions of listeners eager to pigeonhole his work. The new songs sound like the work of an artist confident enough to step back from personal innovation in order to develop styles and themes already in his playbook. This yields some fine results, such as the flagrantly George Harrison-esque ""You Never Know"" and the amusingly self-aware ""Wilco (The Song)"", but the record is more comfortable than exciting or interesting. The more extreme elements of Wilco's style are present-- the sinister Krautrock of ""Spiders (Kidsmoke)"" resurfaces in the paranoid murder fantasy ""Bull Black Nova"" and the sort of delicately arranged instrumental passages that characterized <i>Sky Blue Sky</i> are evident in a more abbreviated form on ""One Wing"" and ""Country Disappeared""-- but these tics are toned down considerably, blending in seamlessly with simple, straightforward numbers such as ""Solitaire"", ""I'll Fight"", and the Feist duet ""You and I"".</p>
<p>Every song on <i>Wilco (The Album)</i> is written and performed with immaculate precision, though the subtleties in the work gradually reveal their charms upon repeated listening. ""Deeper Down"" in particular is a marvel in the way its textures shift dramatically from verse to verse without diverting attention from the relative simplicity of its melody and rhythm. Similarly, the way the band effortlessly evokes waves of guilt, anxiety, and fearful resignation in ""Bull Black Nova"" is masterful and makes the song potentially painful to hear if you're already feeling any of those emotions. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are moments of unapologetic, unguarded beauty, as in the lovely lead guitar and piano parts in ""Country Disappeared"" and the melodramatic orchestral swell in the otherwise understated ""Everlasting Everything"".</p>
<p>This is not the music of men trying to be cool; it is the work of veterans unafraid to express mature emotions with an appropriate level of musical depth and nuance. There is certainly more thrill to be found when the band is acting out but there is something rather pleasing about hearing a band sound so comfortable in their skin. Even if you don't connect with the music on <i>Wilco (The Album)</i>, you may come away from the record envying their relaxed self-assurance. Being a chilled-out grown-up may not always be exciting, but it's certainly something to admire and respect.</p></div>"|13237.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13237-wilco-the-album/|7.3|Matthew Perpetua

Without their biggest stars and their best session group,  Stax executive Al Bell takes a desperate but necessary gamble: in an  attempt to build an entirely new catalog out of scratch, he schedules  dozens of all-new albums and singles to be recorded and released en  masse over the course of a few months. And out of all of those records,  the album that puts the label back on the map is a followup to a chart  dud, recorded by a songwriter/producer who wasn't typically known  for singing, where three of its four songs run over nine and a half  minutes. And this album sells <i>a million copies</i>. If it weren't  for the New York Mets, Isaac Hayes' <i>Hot Buttered Soul </i> would be the most unlikely comeback story of 1969.</p>
<p>Since then, the album's had  an odd reevaluation process: it hit #8 on the pop charts and #1 on the  R&amp;B charts, but also hit #1 on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart-- which alarmed partisans of Miles Davis and Sly Stone alike. After  another couple of albums in its crossover-friendly, string-drenched vein, <i> Rolling Stone </i>declared Isaac Hayes an enemy of all that was good  about soul music in the early 1970s; decades later, a generation  reared on hip-hop reverse-engineered the beats on Pac's ""Me Against  the World"" or PE's ""Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos"" and discovered  an original brilliance. Now, after a listen to this new reissue 40 years  later, <i>Hot Buttered Soul</i> might still seem a little historically  counterintuitive. It stood as a newer, funkier phase of Southern soul,  but it hinged on a sound more opulent than the most sharp-suited Motown  crossover bid. It's an exercise in melodrama and indulgence that lays  it on so heavy it's impossible not to hear it as anything but the  stone truth. And it's an album whose edited-down singles-- both  of which went top 40 pop-- sounded more like trailers for the real  thing. (Said single edits are included here and can be safely ignored.)</p>
<p>Yet the success of <i>Hot Buttered  Soul </i>owed a bit to a classic crossover formula: start with an easy-listening-friendly  pop staple, keep the orchestral sweetness, but layer on a shining veneer  of psychedelic R&amp;B, then stretch it out with some soul-jazz vamping  and nail it down with a voice that hits like a velvet sledgehammer.  Hayes demanded full creative control for this album, and his auteurism  resulted in a luxurious rawness that soul artists would scramble to  catch up with for years. It wasn't exactly an unprecedented sound,  however, and in its own extravagant way <i>Hot Buttered Soul </i> might be to the end of the 60s what Ray Charles' <i>Modern Sounds  in Country and Western Music</i> was seven years previous: an album  that redrew the parameters for R&amp;B's high-class populism.</p>
<p>It's just that it hadn't  been quite this audacious before-- not to the extent of Hayes' cover  of ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"", all 18-plus sprawling minutes  of it. Here we have a song that turns the idea of a slow build into  something monumental: with a monologue he developed as a way to get  apathetic club patrons to pay attention to where he was about to go,  Hayes spends the first eight and a half minutes actually setting the  stage for the scenario <i>behind </i> the song, from the wife's cavalier attitude and how the husband caught  her cheating to the specific year and make of car he finally drove off  for good in (a '65 Ford). It should be noted that all this time the  band's been churning along with this hypnotic, minimalist swaying  organ/bass/hi-hat drone that changes imperceptibly if at all; again,  this is <i>eight and a half minutes </i> here. And when it finally does<i> </i> transition from Hayes' conversational murmur to the first actual sung  line from the Jimmy Webb composition he's covering, it's the beginning  of a metamorphosis that gradually transforms the dynamic of the song  from sweet-stringed orchestration into full-fledged, brass-packed, explosively-cresting  soul.</p>
<p>But where ""Phoenix"" is  all slow build, the album-opening version of ""Walk on By"" throws  almost everything it has at you right away, nailing you to the floor  with those first two drumbeats. Hayes takes the restrained sorrow of  Bacharach and David's composition as made famous by Dionne Warwick  and chucks it out the window, replacing it with an arrangement that  is the absolute antithesis of hiding the tears and sadness and grieving  in private. And it's goddamned devastating at every turn: its go-for-broke  opening, with those weeping strings and that stinging guitar building  to their gigantic crescendo; that moment when it collapses and sinks  into Michael Toles' famous slinky guitar riff, which then warps its  way into psychedelic keening more Hendrix than Cropper; every hitch  and moan and heart-wracked ad-lib from Hayes' deep bass voice (""you  put the <i>hurt </i>on me, you <i>socked it </i> to me, mama""). The entire last half of the song's twelve minutes  is an exercise in seeing just how long you can not only maintain but  build on a frenzied finale, where Toles' guitar sounds like it's  ripping itself apart and Hayes' Hammond organ trembles and growls  and stammers like a panicking tiger. It might be the most intense six  minutes of soul recorded in the confines of a studio the entire decade.</p>
<p>The remainder of <i>Hot Buttered  Soul </i>isn't quite as ambitiously excessive, though the other two  songs still have an indelible presence. Hayes' version of Charles  Chalmers' and Sandra Rhodes' ""One Woman"" is affecting if short-- ""short"" in this case meaning a hair over five minutes. As breathers go, it works wonders in proving Hayes' way with a mellow  ballad could still have an emotional impact in a more confined space.  And Hayes' sole songwriting credit is the linguistically convoluted  masterpiece ""Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic,"" a straight-up  slick-as-hell funk jam which gets a lot of mileage out of humorously-deployed  latin phrases and five-dollar words (""My gastronomical stupensity  is really satisfied when you're loving me""). Even if it's his only  lyrical contribution, he subsequently if unintentionally caricaturizes  the ornate but down-to-earth personality of the entire album: it's  all self-consciously complicated, but man, the meaning's right there  in front of you. And it can't help but hit you right where you feel  it.</p></div>"|13233.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13233-hot-buttered-soul/|9.2|Nate Patrin

The result: nine albums released under the YaHoWha13 name in the 70s, all reissued a decade ago as part of the stunning 13-disc set <i>God and Hair </i>(a set curated by Seeds founder Sky Saxon, a devoted Source member who recently passed away).</p>
<p>But much more of the group's music-- a raw mix of psych, improv, and spoken-word-- was recorded by Source member Isis Aquarian. <i>Magnificence in the Memory </i>represents a small slice of her vast archive, known to insiders as ""The Lost Music"". The album came together when Source compatriot and No Neck Blues Band member Dave Nuss combed through some of Isis' tapes, settling on nine tracks totaling 40 minutes. Nuss intended <i>Magnificence</i> to flow like an album rather than a sampler, and his work paid off, as the record has a remarkably consistent vibe.</p>
<p>How that vibe strikes you will depend on your tolerance for loose, meandering sounds, recorded with varying fidelity and overseen by a frontman who valued enthusiasm over convention or precision. For reference, the collective-based music of descendents like Sun City Girls, Bardo Pond, and Nuss's NNCK comes to mind. YaHoWha13's music sometimes sounds like rock, jazz, blues, even pop. But it's rarely anything you could call easy listening.</p>
<p>Still, you might be surprised by how interesting <i>Magnificence</i> is considering its origin. The Source Family had a lot to say about life and how to live it, but in YaHoWha13, the music was the message. So rather than opening with loud proselytizing, <i>Magnificence </i>begins with Yod's slow whisper on the slinky ""Camp of the Gypsies"". Halfway through, he suddenly screams ""Let's Go!,"" and the band slams into raucous jamming. But even that sounds more like a cloudy seance than preachy gospel. When Yod howls ""I'm gonna lead you home, but not in the usual way!,"" it's hard to deny the second half of that lyric, even if you aren't sold on the first.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Magnificence</i> slyly dodges expectation. Wry humor dots ""Nam Yo Ho Renge Kyo"", whose anonymous intro is delivered in what sounds like Bugs Bunny's faux Asian accent. The clucking guitars of ""Treat You So Right"" bear an the odd logic akin to Captain Beefheart, while Yod's flute-like whistle on ""Sunshine Man"" creates an acid-soaked jingle. Sure, there are recognizable hippie moves here-- ""Fertility Dance"" is basically a drum circle, and ""It's a Knack"" is weirdo-folk in the vein of Syd Barrett or Skip Spence. But that doesn't diminish the warpy noise of ""It Doesn't Matter What You Do"" or the wind-and-drone duet of ""Father Whistling"". Even those tracks reflect the time period, but they still don't sound much like anything else made then or now.</p>
<p>The uninitiated might wonder whether <i>Magnificence </i>is the best introduction to YaHoWha13, as opposed to <i>God and Hair </i>or individual album reissues. But the group was so devoted to Yod's vision that pretty much everything they did provides a portal into their sonic world. <i>Magnficence in the Memory </i>is simply a chance to enter new corners of the Source universe, and future releases-- whether archival or new (the band still tours, though Father Yod passed away in 1975)-- should offer more doors to YaHoWha13's unique perception.</p></div>"|13126.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13126-magnificence-in-the-memory/|7.2|Marc Masters

Except in this case, the relative unknown in question was a star on the Canadian teeny-drama ""<span class=""misspell"">Degrassi</span>: The Next Generation"", and the friends in question are Lil Wayne and Trey <span class=""misspell"">Songz</span> and Chris Paul. Even weirder, the main overarching theme of Drake's <i>So Far Gone</i> seems to be the stresses and travails of fame, even if he recorded the damn thing when he wasn't famous in any meaningful way. And now the tape has made him good and famous for real. I don't know how this kind of thing happens; I just watch it.</p>
<p>Drake's calling card has become ""Best I Ever Had"", a likable, breezy summery pop song that's managed to ascend to Hot 97 omnipresence without any sort of label backing, a very serious achievement. It's a Nerf-heavy declaration of lust with a nice sentiment behind it, Drake telling the song's second-person subject that she's prettiest with no makeup, that she's the fucking best lay he ever had. It also contains the one and only slick punchline Drake offers on the whole hour-plus <span class=""misspell"">mixtape</span>: ""When my album drops, <span class=""misspell"">bitches'll</span> buy it for the picture/ And <span class=""misspell"">niggas'll</span> buy it, too, and claim they got it for they sister.""</p>
<p>See, Drake's not a great rapper. His delivery manages to convey confidence at pretty much all times, but it's still halting and awkward. Half the time, his lines barely even make sense: ""I never get attracted to fans/ <span class=""misspell"">Cuz</span> an eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam""-- huh? And even if the tape is mostly crammed with <span class=""misspell"">emo</span> soul-baring, he still comes up with lines like this: ""My delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man."" Ugh. In his four appearances on the tape, Lil Wayne just annihilates Drake. This wouldn't be news, except we're talking about circa-2009 syrup-fried Wayne here, and it's rarer and rarer that he gets the better of anyone on a song.</p>
<p>And yet <i>So Far Gone</i> still scans as one of the most compulsively listenable <span class=""misspell"">mixtapes</span> of a great year for <span class=""misspell"">mixtapes</span>. Blame <span class=""misspell"">Kanye</span>. Drake isn't just a post-<span class=""misspell"">Kanye</span> artist; he's a post-<i>808s and Heartbreak</i> artist, possibly the first. On that album, <span class=""misspell"">Kanye</span> drifted lazily from rapping to singing over a bed of rippling lush-but-sparse <span class=""misspell"">electro</span> that still gets better every time I hear it. Drake does much the same thing on <i>So Far Gone</i>. He's a singer/rapper in the Missy Elliott mode, and he even pays Missy tribute by swiping the beat from her ""Friendly Skies"" for ""Bria's Interlude"". When he swings from rapping to buttery teen-idol singing, it feels organic and effortless, like he's just doing whatever makes the most sense at any given moment.</p>
<p>Musically, Drake favors a very specific sort of sugary but spacious <span class=""misspell"">electro</span>-soul; nearly every track makes heavy use of organ sustain and sparse heartbeat drums. He uses tracks from Swede-pop types like <span class=""misspell"">Lykke</span> Li and Peter Bjorn and John, the sort of thing that seems forced and gimmicky when most rappers do it. In Drake's hands, though, those songs make sense in close proximity to, say, Jay-<span class=""misspell"">Z's</span> ""Ignorant Shit"" or <span class=""misspell"">Kanye's</span> ""Say You Will"". And it helps that he actually interacts with his source material. With ""Little Bit"", Drake doesn't simply rap over <span class=""misspell"">Lykke</span> Li's original. Instead, he structures it like a duet, he and <span class=""misspell"">Lykke</span> slowly circling each other and admitting their crushed-out feelings. It's cute. My favorite track on the tape is the DJ Screw tribute ""November 18<span class=""misspell"">th</span>"", wherein Drake pulls off something that I've never heard any actual <span class=""misspell"">Houstonians</span> manage (sorry, Big Moe): He turns Screw's slow, woozy sound into <span class=""misspell"">loverman</span> R&amp;B. The lyrical conceit is goofy as hell (""Tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston""-- slow, get it?), but Drake's angelic falsetto floats beautifully over the smeared-streetlights track, and it just sounds right.</p>
<p>And then there's all that price-of-fame stuff. Again, blame <span class=""misspell"">Kanye</span>, because somehow this comes out sounding slippery and interesting rather than petulant and <span class=""misspell"">unbearable</span>. See, Drake's figured out that the way to brag backhandedly-- to brag without bragging-- is to complain about all the awesome shit that you get to endure. So here he is on ""The Calm"": ""<span class=""misspell"">Look what I became, tryna</span> make a name/ All my first dates are interrupted by my fame."" Other rappers talk big about getting mobbed every time I hit the mall; Drake complains about those masses making his candlelit dinners a little bit more awkward. Or: ""My mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out, so I park about five houses down."" You learn he has a Phantom, and you also learn that it's the source of some family strife that doesn't even make sense. Crafty. And now that Drake is really, truly famous, he should really have some shit to complain about.</p></div>"|13238.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13238-so-far-gone/|7.4|Tom Breihan

This was late 2007-- not long after the release of their full-length debut, <i>Arms</i>, a pornographically strict hash of avant-garde classical music, free jazz, and punk. More than noisy, <i>Arms</i> was <i>violent</i>. Like good boxers, <span class=""il"">Zs</span> sensed that timing, precision, and angle meant at least as much as power. I'd heard Lightning Bolt hit harder. And Don Caballero. But Zs-- they were blinding. I buckled.</p>
<p>When I'd interviewed now-former guitarist Charlie Looker earlier that year, he'd promised me they were loosening up. I was skeptical. Under that spotlight in south Brooklyn, they focused so intensely on their scores I think they dented their music stands.</p>
<p>Eventually, they did loosen. A little. <i>Hard</i>, a 15-minute EP released in 2008, had moments that, in their own hyper-regimented ways, were funky. (Use this term responsibly-- Zs still have more in common with locusts and trash compactors than Parliament.) Saxophonist Sam Hillmer had previously played with a tone that could cut grease; on <i>Hard</i>, he added some fuzz and gristle. Guitarist Ben Greenberg started to devote some attention to his sound, not just his notes.</p>
<p>Since <i>Hard</i>, the band has slimmed to a trio: Hillmer on sax, Greenberg on guitar, and Ian Antonio still on drums. <i>Music of the Modern White</i> isn't a loose album, but it's one that suggests a new set of concerns for them: Atmosphere, texture, sonics-- in short, the pats of music you can't notate. This is good: It drags them off the page and into the room, making the music sound more like dialogue. Most of the album's first half is howling, spectral noise. Textured, too. When Hillmer finally stumbles into the mix, his playing is expressive and unscripted-- more like a devotional than a calculation. The second half is quieter, breaking into a light, orderly pattern of handclaps and harmonics. It concludes with a meditative, droning wash so far removed from anything on <i>Arms</i> that it's hard not to smile: Zs got loose.</p>
<p>But <i>Music of the Modern White</i> isn't drone, it isn't ambient, and it isn't easy. Even in repose, <span class=""il"">Zs</span> are still a band probably best kept away from tinder and picnics. Still, it's transitional music for them. They're like birds trying to figure out how to be bears. What they're doing now might not play to their obvious strengths -- but they also might just be developing new strengths. Having seen what I've seen of them till now, I don't doubt that once they figure out what they want next, they'll grab it by the throat.</p></div>"|13128.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13128-music-of-the-modern-white/|6.5|Mike Powell

You have to wonder if this was a shout-out to their li'l homey Bibio, who cut three records for Mush from the whole cloth of this idea. Like his idols, he filled his electro-acoustic music with antiquated cultural products and nature sounds-- things that are beautiful because we've less and less use for them. But he lacked range, his wavering loop-collages falling into two categories: those informed by the sprightly forms of British folk, and those that were nearly formless.</p>
<p>Bibio released <i>Vignetting the Compost</i> just five months ago, and it seemed to cement his status as a pleasant one-trick pony. So it's shocking how utterly and successfully he rewrites his playbook on this Warp debut. I actually have to eat a little crow. I wrote of <i>Compost </i>that Bibio had a ""thin, modest voice that verges on anonymity,"" and suggested that he should favor atmosphere over songcraft. This seemed justified: The more the songs approximated pop structures, the less interesting they became. But on <i>Ambivalence Avenue</i>, Bibio proves that he actually <i>can </i>sing and produce memorable arrangements. He used to make FX blurs with traces of pop and folk; now he inverts that formula with bracing clarity.</p>
<p>The results are fantastic and diverse: The title track weaves bouncing vocals through crisp guitar licks and bouncy flutes; ""All the Flowers"" is a fey folk gem; the dreamy ""Haikuesque (When She Laughs)"" is better indie-rock than many indie-rockers are making these days. Summery anthem ""Lovers' Carvings"" coasts on crunchy, gleaming riffs and upbeat woodblocks, and the autumnal ""The Palm of Your Wave"" is simply haunting. It's hard to believe that these inspired, moving vocal performances are coming from the same guy who recorded moaning ambiguities like ""Mr. &amp; Mrs. Compost"". Occasionally, you'll hear a little tremble in the strings and go, ""Oh right, this is <i>Bibio</i>,"" but mostly, detuned atmosphere has been replaced by silky drive.</p>
<p>While these songs are a quantum leap for Bibio, they still reasonably project from the foundation he's laid. But there's no accounting for the remainder of the album, which finds him paddling the uncharted waters of hip-hop, techno, and points outlying. ""Jealous of Roses"" sets lustrous funk riffs dancing between the stereo channels as Bibio belts out a surprisingly effective Sly-Stone-in-falsetto impersonation. ""Fire Ant"" spikes the loping soul of J Dilla with the stroboscopic vocal morsels of the Field; ""Sugarette"" wheezes and fumes like a Flying Lotus contraption. The music feels both spontaneous and precise, winding in complex syncopation around the one-beat, with subtle filter and tempo tweaks, and careful juxtapositions of texture (see the arid, throttled voices scraping against the sopping-wet chimes of ""S'vive""). Many songs taper off into ambient passages that have actual gravity, gluing the far-flung genres together. It's the kind of seamless variety, heady but visceral, that few electronic musicians who aren't Four Tet have achieved.</p>
<p>While <i>Ambivalence Avenue</i> is an excellent album by any measure, Bibio deserves extra credit for venturing outside of his established comfort zone. He began his musical career trying to emulate Steve Reich and Boards of Canada on no-fi equipment. He was fascinated by the physicality of media-- of degrading tape and malfunctioning recording gear. And he was interested in the natural world, letting the sounds of streams and rainshowers stand in for his own personality. Having depleted these ideas over the course of three solid albums, he's put them aside to do nearly the opposite. <i>Ambivalence Avenue</i> moves the focus from the flaws of media to their capacity for precision, and takes fewer cues from nature than from the urban sounds-- including Dilla and Madlib-- that Bibio admits discovering in recent years. By jettisoning a limiting aesthetic, he reveals his abilities to be startlingly vast, and one of our most predictable electronic musicians becomes a wild card.</p></div>"|13125.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13125-ambivalence-avenue/|8.3|Brian Howe

So it is with the visual creations of Welsh artist and toymaker Pete Fowler. Readers of this review will most likely know Fowler from the space aliens and other strange cartoonish beasties he has drawn for the covers of every Super Furry Animals album since 1997 except for one (2007's <i>Hey Venus!</i>, created by Japan's Keiichi Tanaami). Love 'em or hate 'em, Fowler's fanciful, bulbous images have helped SFA establish a visual aesthetic every bit as distinctive as their music, with a shared spirit of childlike mischief and spaced-out merriment.</p>
<p><i>A Psychedelic Guide to Monsterism Island</i>-- the follow-up to 2005's impossibly scarce <i>The Sounds of Monsterism Island, Vol. 1</i>-- is basically a soundtrack to the lovingly detailed dreamworld inhabited by Fowler's characters. In film terms, though, it works more like a score than a hit-crammed blockbuster soundtrack, conjuring its woozy and whimsical mood out of 20 mostly instrumental tracks of folk, prog, cosmic disco, and hazy Moog rock. In other words, it's uncharacteristically easy to ignore, floating almost at the edge of perception. As with the like-minded psychedelia on London label Ghost Music, however, you shouldn't necessarily hold that against it. This can be transportative stuff.</p>
<p>Even if the compilation isn't always mind-blowing, psych nerds and obscurity-seekers should be able to find a few choice tracks to spin or sample. Super Furries frontman Gruff Rhys' ""Wild Robots Power Up"" sounds like its title, all chintzy electronic beats and hypnotic power-station drones. The Future Sound of London, appearing under their Amorphous Androgynous alias, go in for woolly psych-rock that's as bubbly as Fowler's creations. Inclusions from Luke Vibert, Beyond the Wizard Sleeve (aka Richard Norris), Circulus, and Belbury Poly range from sine-wave workouts to ominous grooves and even hobbit-ready lute-folk. The bright strums of Brazilian DJ/producer duo ""Magic Morning"" on ""Monsters at Work"" are quietly revelatory, inhabiting a universe not far from Quiet Village or recent nu-Balearic.</p>
<p>The disc's biggest flaw lies in apparently assuming we've already made the trip to Monsterism Island rather than gently guiding us there. The krautrock repetitions of Marc Shearer's ""Magma on My Mind"" or the Southern-fried electric guitar noodling of Wolf People's ""Village Strollin'"" are enjoyable enough on their own, but as compiled here, it all starts to blend together. Many listeners will find themselves drifting off-- losing themselves not in Monsterism Island, but in the late-2000s' many realtime distractions. The spoken-word interludes are a cute affectation, and they could take on more meaning if Fowler's talked-about children's TV show ever gets off the ground, but you won't find yourself wanting to listen to them very often.</p>
<p>Still, every time my head starts nodding, <i>A Psychedelic Guide to Monsterism Island</i> jolts me back to attentiveness with moments of Fowlerian wryness. Take the Advisory Circle's ""Lair of the Grolfax"", which sounds like ""You Only Live Twice"" covered as intergalactic lounge music by Air. ""What a strange dream,"" a monster's deep, gruff voice intones on the closing track, summing up the whole collection. ""It ebbs from my mind like treacle."" <i>Monster</i> treacle?</p></div>"|13230.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13230-a-psychedelic-guide-to-monsterism-island/|6.0|Marc Hogan

Though each of these acts roughs up music a little differently, all sound at home in the bedroom or basement.

<p>Like a former labelmate of theirs, Ganglians have released two equally robust records almost simultaneously.

Opener ""Hair"" is surf rock slicing through filthy water, a standout whose melodic scope is somehow lost in the instant crash and fray of ""Rats Man"". Such jarring transitions, while never draining life from the EP's songs individually, typify the scattershot nature of the record as a whole.

The latter is a near seven-minute highlight that opens itself up entirely, rolling through a few minutes of pastoral down-strumming before the low-end arrives and transforms the song into an epic pow-wow with the Kinks. But those two stripes of jam interact with one another with an organic ease that most records in this vein sorely miss, a quality that more than compensates for <i>Monster Head Room</i>'s lack of variety. Fidelity aside, that's a feeling punctuated by the wonderfully damaged vocal harmonies of closer ""Try to Understand"". It's a bike-ride of a song that puts its own spin the Beach Boys or the psych-folk-pop-argh of Grizzly Bear.

I just  finished David Foster Wallace's <i>Infinite Jest</i>, a brilliant thousand-page  tome of postmodern, apocalyptic indulgence that, to over-simplify, requires  almost as much pretense to read as it might have taken to write. The  book, published in 1996, foresaw the rise in Bush-era thick-headedness and ubiquitous on-demand entertainment, all set in a unified North America. Thing is, most of the action takes place between Americans  and a conflicted Canada (get this: Québécois terrorists seek to distribute  an American film so entertaining, it will literally kill you), while  Mexico dutifully bows to the American President's whim. Just about  the most vibrant picture of Mexico is the ironically re-imagined presidential  seal where the eagle wears a sombrero.</p>
<p>Point is, America often views (some might say ""stereotypes"") Mexico through the filter of its rich tradition rather than its current  culture. However, globalization having done its thing, the new generation  of young Mexicans is making art with increasingly international roots, including indie rock.  While Canada has already gotten its share of attention (cf. <i>Jest</i>'s  killer entertainment; in real life, they've got Arcade Fire),  Mexican exports like Juan Son,  Seamus, and Hello Seahorse! (whose new record, <i>Bestia</i>, is out  now)-- who weave their Anglo-Continental influences into sublimated Latin textures-- still await American adoption. In fact, Hello Seahorse!'s  best known song could just as easily have come out of Montreal or Stockholm  as la Ciudad de México. ""Won't Say Anything"", sung in English, affects the anthemic twee of Los Campesinos! or (at their best) I'm From Barcelona,  repeating the eponymous refrain into the ether on the group's last record <i>Hoy a las Ocho</i>.</p>
<p><i>Bestia</i> contains no English language  singing, and also nothing quite on the level of ""Won't Say Anything"", but it's a drastically darker and more complex effort. Opener ""Bestia"" crescendos into an explosion of overdriven drums  and synthesizer lines before hitting Lo Blondo's icily recorded vocals. Blondo told webzine ""Al Borde"" the band desired to create a record that communicated their emotions, and it  doesn't take a degree in Spanish to get the conflict in those feelings.  Even seemingly upbeat cuts like ""Criminal"" are pregnant with the  seeds of minor-key melancholy underneath their peppy Casio lines. The  urge to get something, anything off their chest is so palpable, it can undercut the elegant melodies the band honed on <i>Hoy A Las Ocho</i>.  The near-classic moments here, ""Bestia"" and ""Oso Polar"", combine melodic complexity with the relative simplicity of rapid-fire verse-chorus-verse  interplay and the reliable signifiers of simple wonky synthesizers. The  band's fussiest cuts, on the other hand, sound like the same brilliant  lines sung in agonizing slow motion.</p>
<p>Of course, I risk judging a record  whose language I barely understand too rigorously by the standards of twee and indie, sounds largely formed by British art-school kids. Likewise, there's a potential  danger that the appearance of these young Mexican groups signals cultural  co-optation, kind of like a musical analogue to the ubiquity of McDonalds in foreign countries. But wherever  Hello Seahorse! planted their musical roots, their heartfelt take on the (assumedly) complicated emotions that accompany melodic elegance places them amongst  the continent's most exciting current young groups. The band seems  inexorably tied with the fortunes of a youth culture radiating out of  Mexico City that seeks an additive effect on their nation's musical  identity. And hey, <i>Bestia</i> may not be lethally entertaining, but  it'll sure kill a lot of stereotypes.</p></div>"|13234.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13234-bestia/|7.1|Mike Orme

These projects tend to be diffuse  and ambitious: Shalabi works with dozens of musicians on long, brash  drones, or plays meditative oud pieces in comfy theaters. Land  of Kush, Shalabi's newest project, is pretty much par for his course,  as <i>Against the Day</i> features nearly 30 musicians playing music inspired  by 1960s Egyptian orchestral music, the album's moniker and song titles  drawn from the five chapters of Thomas Pynchon's <i>Against the Day</i>.</p>
<p>Like fellow Constellation traveler  Efrim Menuck (A Silver Mt. Zion, Godspeed You! Black Emperor), who helped  record and mix <i>Against the Day</i>, Shalabi has mostly abandoned an early  formula for something with a scope and ambition that has frequently outpaced Shalabi's  execution, but in ways that have continually revealed his commitment  and passion to his art. <i>Against the Day</i>'s mistakes are similarly  easy to stomach: huge, lurching compositions without obvious destination  or crescendo, dense, wordy narrative, a near lack of subtlety.</p>
<p>As always, Shalabi's realized blend  of traditional, popular, and avant-garde leans heavily on the avant-garde;  should you happen to be familiar with 1960s Egyptian orchestral music... well,  please also familiarize yourself with Popol Vuh. ""The Light  Over the Ranges"" opens the LP with cellar-noise, a moaning  voice, and keyboard twiddling; the album only occasionally sounds more  normal or traditional, even when it's more decipherable. A few  appended minutes of humid, cawing strings remind of Shalabi's early  work, but the rhythmic, snaking of ""Iceland Spar"", with its  awkward, sing-speak melody mostly tatter that notion. The vocals  sit low in the mix, their phrasing and melody distinctly non-Western,  as the singer narrates a tale of over-consumption, presumably leading  to an apocalypse: ""1,000 years to one day.""</p>
<p>The centerpiece of <i>Against the Da</i>y  is another vocal-oriented track, the bilious and forceful ""Bilocations"",  which follows the imagistic story of a young woman-- written and sung  by Molly Sweeney-- from her adventurous childhood (""When I was eight years old I scared away a mountain lion"") to an affair with a  Western businessman (some of the lyrics, too literal for their own good,  grate: ""You're an expert in mergers and acquisitions/ In the field  of economics""). When Sweeney sings that the man doesn't ""know squat  about biology or immunology"" it sounds both sexual and threatening,  imbuing <i>Against the Day</i> with a frailty its huge movements sometimes  lack.</p>
<p>Shalabi's troupe doesn't always exhibit  such tenderness or control. The record's final two tracks, one an amphetamine-laced  guitar rave-up, the other a boondoggle of reedy noise and ponderous  atmosphere, fail to capture any of Shalabi's murky psych magic.   Elsewhere, portions of ""Iceland Spar"" and ""Bilocations""  make it seem as if Shalabi is trying to reverse a freighter in a small  bay, so momentous and grand are the tracks. Shalabi sets his collaborators  in motion but can't always steer them. This makes <i>Against the  Day</i> an exciting and unpredictable listen, but it also assures no small  amount of folly. Shalabi trades in movements, not moments, though,  and <i>Against the Day</i>'s frailties seem like a small toll to pay for his imagination.</p></div>"|12912.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12912-against-the-day/|6.1|Andrew Gaerig

Post-rock was one of the most active threads of 90s indie, and Tortoise not only set the bar for it, they leaped right over it. While many of their peers interpreted post-rock as ""rock, but boring,"" they hybridized completely novel forms. Their music was informed not only by Chicago's energetic out-jazz scene, but also drum'n'bass, electro, lounge music, techno, hip-hop, dub, and modernist innovations. They released a remix record way before that was really a done thing in indie rock. They didn't single-handedly broaden the genre's horizons, but their stature could make it appear that way-- after <i>Standards</i>, for a minute, it seemed as if other bands were going to have to rush to catch up.</p>
<p>And then, Tortoise rather quietly faded from view. What happened? At some point in the first of the decade, indie rock values shifted a bit: cerebral was out, and emotions were back in fashion. As if wrong-footed by this shift, Tortoise clammed up until 2004, when they returned with the unfocused <i>It's All Around You</i>, and then followed with a covers album. Thus their first new album in five years, <i>Beacons of Ancestorship</i>, finds Tortoise in a unique position. Now that smuggling non-guitar genres into indie rock is commonplace, the record could feel like a postmortem of Tortoise's own influence, and the air of self-consciousness that often attends their music thickens.</p>
<p>At their best, Tortoise make academic genre-exercises sound brawny and visceral, and the first half of <i>Beacons </i>finds them firing on all circuits. The first six songs are pretty much straight fire, especially ""Northern Something"", with its icy clockwork percussion and a hyperactive bass line that throbs like a tooth ache. If it sounds a little French Touch-y, that's appropriate: Dance music has always been in Tortoise's arsenal, but it takes center stage here. Thrust and lift, pause and glide, are favored over tricky atmosphere. It's modular music, with static and rushing analog synths interpenetrating around crisp, cyclical percussion.</p>
<p>Genre allusions proliferate like footnotes: the double-time clap-track at the end of iridescent guitar-and-synth anthem ""Prepare Your Coffin"", or the brief but compelling ""Penumbra"", which appears to try and replicate the sound of pitch-shifted loops with live players. ""Gigantes"" is a wave of minimalist snips and ripples, and opener ""High Class Slim Came Floatin' In"" is a chin-stroking rave dissection, its movements divided by surgical slices rather than MDMA-stoking whooshes. The synths turn against the drums as precisely as fine-threaded screws, and the explosive climax feels both awesome and unearned. It demonstrates how Tortoise’s meticulous poise can sap their music's energy-- despite the overdriven synths, the track feels heavy handedly mediated, like a cut-away diagram of a song.</p>
<p>A curious thing happens after this vigorous opening stretch. After pivoting on the punk-rock blast of ""Yinxianghechengqi"", Tortoise lose enthusiasm for the about-techno aesthetic they're exploring, and gently backslide toward the alien lounge music that seems to be their lowest gear. As this happens, it bolsters the sense of stiffness on tracks like ""High Class Slim"". ""The Fall of Seven Diamonds Plus One"" is the kind of high-desert Morricone fantasy it feels like they've done a million times before, and ""Monument Six One Thousand"" tentatively splits the difference between dreamy-Tortoise and dancey-Tortoise. ""Minors"" simply recapitulates the same ideas as ""Prepare Your Coffin"" with less conviction. It's not that these songs are bad, any more than <i>It's All Around You</i> was bad-- they're just a little low-impact from a band of whom we expect a lot.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that for most bands, <i>Beacons of Ancestorship</i> would be the very definition of an ambitious record-- commanding, aiming for conceptual unity and broad scope. But this mode seems to come naturally for Tortoise, and their mastery of it accounts for the record's broad successes and slight drawbacks alike. At this point, an ambitious Tortoise record would loosen the reins a bit, perhaps even enlist an outside producer to puncture the band's hermetic seal, and let in a bit of the world. You want to see them lose some control, to sacrifice a bit of the exactitude they've honed and allow for serendipity. You want to see them at least risk fucking up, and acknowledging that music is played by humans. Now that Tortoise have inarguably mastered the consideration of their namesake, it might not hurt them to tap into a little of the impulsiveness of the hare.</p></div>"|13121.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13121-beacons-of-ancestorship/|7.9|Brian Howe

Allin. You'd be hard pressed to find three more disparate rock acts, yet on <i>Varshons</i> they all sound like the Lemonheads-- boppy, overcast alt-rock delivered at a fast clip and sung in a whiskey tenor. Since their earliest albums, the Boston group has made covers a cornerstone of their concerts and albums, such that you could assemble a pretty wide-ranging retrospective based wholly on their treatments of songs by Suzanne Vega, Charles Manson, the Louvin Brothers, and <i>Hair</i>. And <i>Varshons</i> starts predictably strong: The Lemonheads play Parsons' ""I Just Can't Take It Anymore"" like it was written especially for them, much as they did with his ""Brass Buttons"" years ago, and Wire's ""Fragile"" is a short burst of desert melody that turns the tense rhythms of the original into a light-as-air sing-along reminiscent of <i>It's a Shame About Ray</i>. But the keeper here is ""Layin' Up with Linda"", which despite its unsavory aspects-- mindless violence against women-- manages the nifty trick of turning Allin's skeezepunk original into a country-tinged murder ballad.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As discomfiting as that song may be, it not only makes the next song, Townes Van Zandt's ""Waiting Around to Die"", sound tame but proves that Dando's women troubles are a lot more compelling than his drug problems. Starting with Randy Alvey &amp; the Green Fuz's ""Green Fuz"", a middling hallucinogenic number, <i>Varshons</i> descends into a narco-musical haze. ""Yesterlove"" is a superlatively stoned joint originally by rock tabla player Sam Gopal; Dando keeps that instrument as the song's foundation, which means it doesn't sound much like the Lemonheads. Similarly, ""Dandelion Seeds"", originally by psychedelic outfit July, is an aimless trip that meets the original in the past instead of bringing it up to date. The depth and breadth of the tracklist are commendable but often work against the band. Dando obviously has a large collection of vinyl and a good knowledge of rarely trampled pop terrain, but what good is it if most everything here comes across as either half-assed or poorly chosen?</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Half the fun of any covers album is hearing an artist translate songs to their own particular sound, reimagining and reinventing them in their own image. As such, the cover of Arling &amp; Cameron's ""Dirty Robot"" sounds like cheating. They use the same turgid synths that clogged the original, which means the song sounds like the work of a different band. Kate Moss' vocals are really the only interesting aspect of the cover, not because they're especially inspired but because it's Kate fuckin' Moss. Liv Tyler fares better on an otherwise limp cover of Leonard Cohen's ""Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye"", where her soft vocals make a striking complement to Dando's.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It's almost ironic that the best cover here is also the least obscure. Linda Perry's ""Beautiful"" is becoming a standard of the 2000s; originally sung by Christina Aguilera, it's been covered by Clem Snide, the All-American Rejects, and Elvis Costello. But here Dando makes it his own, even if that means he makes it sound like it's playing over the closing credits to <i>Empire Records</i>. It's an ideal match between singer and song, a surprising moment that almost makes up for the mess that came before it. Almost.</p></div>"|13117.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13117-varshons/|4.7|Stephen M. Deusner

Yes? Well, fuck them in the eye socket with their own falling-apart thesauruses! Better yet, fuck them in the eye socket with an Alasdair Roberts record-- with this record, <i>Spoils</i>. Because, damn, Alasdair Roberts has made the best album of his 14-year career. And while it's very smart, you might not even know that it's as smart as it is until after you've heard it a dozen times. That it's so strong considering it's a weirdo folk-rock record with lyrics like ""I was bilious and saturnine/ As I walked from shrine to wayside shrine"" is almost a miracle.</p>
<p>Writers like to compare Roberts' work to that of Will Oldham's. Hardly a word gets written about the guy without first mentioning that what Oldham does to American trad folk, Roberts does to its British counterpart. Seeing that they share the same record label, have worked together, and both obviously fuck around with the idea of ""folk"" in their own ways, it's not the worst comparison. The way Roberts pushes the envelope for Brit. Isles-based music is perhaps closer to the way that singer/guitarist Nic Jones' justly-revered arrangements of ancient forgotten whaling shanties and murder-suicide ballads updated those songs by adding new melodies carefully picked on his guitar. But no one's going to confuse Roberts' version of ""The Magpie's Nest"" with Shirley Collins', or his take on ""When a Man's in Love"" with Chris Foster's. And though the guy <i>has</i> made entire traditional albums, he's not a traditional artist. This record is all originals, and it's very strange, if subtly so.</p>
<p>These eight songs pick up where 2007's genre-tweaking <i>Amber Gatherers</i> left off. But they also resonate with the melodic goodness of his stripped-down 2001 debut, <i>The</i> <i>Crook of My Arm</i>. And you could say that they regain the occasional freak-out intensity of Roberts' work with/as Appendix Out. The main developments over prior recordings are sonic and structural: the super ripping guitar that cuts through on ""Hazel Forks""; the heavy electric guitar that kicks in halfway through the seven-minute ""The Flying of Grief &amp; Joy (Eternal Return)""; the doubled-up flutes on ""You Muses Assist""; the thunder cracks and violin peering through behind cascading nylon strings on ""Under No Enchantment (But My Own)"". The songs often muck about to create new structures: bits of a ballad form collapse in on parts of a reel that collides with sort of a pop anthem. Is it prog? The album makes this listener want to live inside a cozy little cottage in the countryside, something made of wood and stone with ancient leaded windows covered in moss, so maybe.</p>
<p>The way Roberts' often high-pitched brogue wraps itself around sentences is pretty as hell; his voice has never sounded better, nor has it been recorded this clearly before. There's a sense of humor at work with Roberts that meshes quite well with his poetic way with words. It takes multiple listens to get at the tunes' meaning, and not just because of differences between the mother tongue and the American one. It's hard to argue with the sentiment of ""Ned Ludd's Rant (For a World Rebarbarised)"", which could be from an album by London garage-rocker Dan Melchior: ""Now we rob graverobber's graves and redisplay the plunder/ And we fill some dead composer's staves with irony and thunder,"" he sings, before ending the song with, ""That's only what this old guitar puts into my mouth.""</p></div>"|13110.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13110-spoils/|8.0|Mike McGonigal

You could count on two hands the number of people actually affected by our president's latest dick move. Newt Gingrich had left both his posts, and for an all-too-brief while, things were quiet on the batshit front. The District's favorite sons, Fugazi had settled into a nice little rut before their as-yet-unbroken hiatus, and as the last decade has taught us, a world with Fugazi is preferable to one without.</p>
<p>It's easy to romanticize turn of the century D.C. as a creative hotbed, especially with the records to prove it; the DeSoto and Dischord catalogs are testament to the wellspring beneath the swamp city as we entered the second Bush administration. Certainly So Many Dynamos are as guilty of it as any, as they've built a career around the breathless hooks, hyperkinetic song structure, splattery disco-funk drums, and emo confessionalism of the city's now-decade-old renaissance. Never mind that they're Midwestern boys who didn't get around to dropping their first full length until well after the 'Plan dismembered; as a downstate Illinoisian with precisely zero Burning Airlines tickets stubs in my collection, I, too, think fondly of a scene of which I wasn't anywhere close to a member. In most ways, it's great to have a 2009 record that'd keep the awkward button-up-and-Converse dance party of <i>No Kill No Beep Beep</i> going strong; even now, 1999-era D.C. is certainly fresher ground than, say, two years later in New York. But it's hard not to think of So Many Dynamos as much more than a throwback act, particularly without the songs some of their time-travel contemporaries managed to eek out.</p>
<p>Any D.C. band worth its loft space had to have a rhythm section as locked-in as the Republican-controlled Congress, and in synth-bassist/vocalist Aaron Stovall and drummer Clayton Kunstel, the Dynamos certainly have that. It's the first thing you'll notice on opener ""Artifacts of Sound"" and, well, much of the rest of <i>The Loud Wars</i>; Stovall and Kunstel just dig in, with Stovall's forcible fingerwork and Kunstel's from-all-directions drumming lay the groundwork for virtually off of the <i>Wars</i>. This rock-solid foundation allows for embellishment wherever there's a spare inch, and the Dynamos dress up <i>Loud Wars</i> in whirring trebly synths and, yes, ""angular"" guitar stabs and as many of Stovall's words that will fit in the space.</p>
<p>So, yeah, if you'd walked into Melody Records circa summer 1999 and heard <i>The Loud Wars</i>, you wouldn't have batted an eye. And that's just it; <i>The Loud Wars</i> is formula, and it's not even really the Dynamos' formula to use, so when the songs fall a bit flat, it's hard to know whom to point the finger at. <i>The Loud Wars</i> runs on amicably enough-- helped by its ripchord pace from front-to-back, yet another D.C. trademark that marked the least essential-in-hindsight of those records-- and you'd be hard up to finger a bad tune here, but it's all about the same: the same reference points, the same too-busy-by-half arrangements, the same emphasis on proficiency over depth, the same defensively bummed out lyrics, the same slightly sour melodies, the same sense that you're dancing through some kind of dread that's hard to place a finger on. It also doesn't help that this is certainly the Dynamos' least engaging record sonically-- everything feels squashed, the same color of burnt umber, a hue courtesy of traditionally more technicolor producer Chris Walla of Death Cab for Cutie-- or that Stovall's voice seems to be veering a little farther from Travis Morrison (which is good!) and a little closer to that dude from Cake. That is less good.</p>
<p>When I take <i>The Loud Wars</i> as a justifiably forgotten but enjoyable enough record from a bygone era, I'm soothed; it's a little better than, oh, <i>Fake French</i> or something, and I'm sure as hell not going to dig around to find that one with this thing floating around. But it's 2009, and as you're well aware, D.C.'s turned over a couple times now, which makes what So Many Dynamos are doing roughly as fresh as a Linda Tripp joke. One can't help but wonder what the Dynamos might find if they fixed their gaze a ways past Fort Reno; go-go, perhaps?</p></div>"|13118.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13118-the-loud-wars/|5.5|Paul Thompson

In addition to his work on game-changers  like Animal Collective's <i>Sung Tongs</i> and Panda Bear's <i>Person  Pitch</i>, Santos has also helped shaped sounds on record for Gang Gang  Dance, fellow Paw Track clan member Dent May, as well as last year's  much slept-upon Born Ruffians long-player <i>Red Yellow &amp; Blue</i>.  Trying to pick up on threads that run constant throughout a résumé that varied would make for some headphone headaches. Fortunately, Santos  formed a band of his own.</p>
<p>The Present is Santos' recent collaboration  with Japanese musician Mina and Jesse Lee of Gang Gang Dance and White  Magic, a project in which Santos further experiments with fusing together  much of the same gossamer textures and elements that galvanized the  walls of sound he helped erect as a producer.  In October of last  year, the trio released <i>World I See</i>, a remarkably arranged spirit  journey that, according to Santos, was written and recorded stream of  consciousness, using just guitar, keys, and drums. But it never sounds  that simple nor familiar-- the line between organic and synthetic remains  ever blurred. In fact, the sharp divide between the Present's output  and their straight-ahead setup is a gap still very much a part of what  also makes the band's latest audiomosaic, <i>The Way We Are</i>, just as  fascinating.</p>
<p>Opener ""Heavens on Ice"" spans 13  minutes of astral transmissions and vocal warp zones. Couched somewhere  in all the synthetic chaos sits a short-lived stretch of breathtaking  guitar melody and tribal rhythms totally unblemished. It's worth the  mining, pretty yet inaccessible. Interlude ""Love Melody"" is equally  beautiful, a chunk of magnetic oasis that sits between even more shards  of manipulated sound, all of which clatter and skitter and morph into duo ""Symbols on High"" and ""Africanized Beatniks"". For  better or worse, <i>The Way We Are is</i> more easily digested than its predecessor.  Though the synth palette is less abrasive and the song lengths infinitely  less intimidating (only ""Saltwater Trails"" comes close to flirting  with the 10-minute mark), it's still very closely related in purpose.   ""Shapeshifter"" sandwiches a grind of harsh screens and lunar-laundromat  noise between cascades of keys. To close: ""Press Play"", a staunchly  industrial jam that lets only a few slivers of light through before  calling it a day. This is a difficult listening experience for certain,  but check those album titles: Santos seems to be trying to transcend  the idea of listening experience in particular. He's taken to finding  a spectrum of sound that mirrors more than just a moment.</p></div>"|13306.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13306-world-i-see-the-way-we-are/|7.3|David Bevan

In October of last  year, the trio released <i>World I See</i>, a remarkably arranged spirit  journey that, according to Santos, was written and recorded stream of  consciousness, using just guitar, keys, and drums. But it never sounds  that simple nor familiar-- the line between organic and synthetic remains  ever blurred. In fact, the sharp divide between the Present's output  and their straight-ahead setup is a gap still very much a part of what  also makes the band's latest audiomosaic, <i>The Way We Are</i>, just as  fascinating.</p>
<p>Opener ""Heavens on Ice"" spans 13  minutes of astral transmissions and vocal warp zones. Couched somewhere  in all the synthetic chaos sits a short-lived stretch of breathtaking  guitar melody and tribal rhythms totally unblemished. It's worth the  mining, pretty yet inaccessible. Interlude ""Love Melody"" is equally  beautiful, a chunk of magnetic oasis that sits between even more shards  of manipulated sound, all of which clatter and skitter and morph into duo ""Symbols on High"" and ""Africanized Beatniks"". For  better or worse, <i>The Way We Are is</i> more easily digested than its predecessor.  Though the synth palette is less abrasive and the song lengths infinitely  less intimidating (only ""Saltwater Trails"" comes close to flirting  with the 10-minute mark), it's still very closely related in purpose.   ""Shapeshifter"" sandwiches a grind of harsh screens and lunar-laundromat  noise between cascades of keys. To close: ""Press Play"", a staunchly  industrial jam that lets only a few slivers of light through before  calling it a day. This is a difficult listening experience for certain,  but check those album titles: Santos seems to be trying to transcend  the idea of listening experience in particular. He's taken to finding  a spectrum of sound that mirrors more than just a moment.</p></div>"|13306.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13306-world-i-see-the-way-we-are/|7.4|David Bevan

It was rewarding, but it was also cramped and  fussy. And  it was long, or at least it felt long. There was also leader Spencer  Krug's cryptic wordplay and metaphors; he hinted at a narrative that  the listener wasn't in on. Across his many projects (Wolf Parade, Sunset Rubdown, Swan Lake), Krug often comes off as brooding, wise, and unknowable-- his music attracts because it's difficult to decode his lyrics and untangle his melodies. However, on his latest Sunset Rubdown album, <i>Dragonslayer,</i> Krug gives us a fluent, easily likable version of his work.</p>
<p><i>Dragonslayer</i> is a looser Sunset record-- easier to like,  easier to understand. Tension used to come from stops and starts in the songs, but now the mood  changes between tracks. <i>Dragonslayer</i> shifts from stately formality (""Silver  Moons""), to heart-pounding new wave skitter (""Idiot Heart"") and  anxious, head-over-heels tumbles (""Apollo and the Buffalo and Anna  Anna Anna Oh!""), but it generates continuity between songs. <i>Dragonslayer</i> still centers on piano and keyboard, with Krug picking out (instead of pounding out) the tunes.  ""You Go on Ahead (Trumpet Trumpet II)"" in particular boasts a beautifully  clean melody. But this song-- like many Sunset Rubdown tracks-- gets  more strident noisier as it moves. It's just that <i>Dragonslayer</i> moves forward with more finesse.</p>
<p>Krug's lyrics feel, at first, as knotted and complex as ever. But  now it's easier to draw connections and dig around for meanings. Thematically, this  album has a lot in common with <i>Random Spirit Lover</i>, as Krug continues  to sketch half-told tales of lovers or friends caught in their own recklessness.  His lyrics seem formal, but with a natural twist. Krug obsesses over the rare  and ephemeral: black swans, virgins, or paper lace, which either burns,  fades, or ""crumples into ugly shapes"" (""Paper Lace"").  What seems like a pile of metaphors is just Krug simplifying the world. Actions are products of instinct or fate,  always out of our control, easier to describe than understand. It's Krug's way of-- perhaps insufficiently-- interpreting  the world without fully taming it.</p>
<p>Take ""Paper Lace"". It first appeared in sparse, hollow form on Swan  Lake's <i>Enemy Mine </i>earlier this year. ""Those were good ideas,  but they weren't diamonds and pearls,"" Krug sings while the drums  laze to the ending. So his work wasn't done. Here he revamps it into  a sinewy, shimmering form. Then there's ""Paper Lace""'s sly invitation:  ""Come be a wild thing.""  Krug knows things will end (badly), and  secretly hopes that it is so. There's no doing laundry together, none  of the city buses of Wolf Parade's ""Grounds for Divorce"", no beer runs in <i>Dragonslayer</i>'s world. It's escapist fantasy  fiction (though there's only one real dragon, right at the end).</p>
<p>But, that's the way we're used to Sunset Rubdown sounding: fussy, untouchable,  otherwordly. Let's not associate difficulty wih quality though. <i>RSL</i> had a greater chance for escape and awe; <i>Dragonslayer</i> was  built for performance, and it sounds good live because the songs sound comfortable  and straightforward. Sunset Rubdown are best when they are unfettered  by those concerns, when they are fully soaked in their own set of thematic  and sonic touchstones and could give a shit if they're understood or  not.</p></div>"|13232.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13232-dragonslayer/|8.3|Jessica Suarez

In a world of manufactured, auto-tuned pop stars and wispy-voiced indie-chanteuse pinups it's nice to see an honest-to-god female rock star who is provocative, strong, and sexy with the muscular vocal chops to match. Since the release of 2005's <i>Standing in the Way of Control</i>, Ditto has become a superstar in the UK, hobnobbing with Karl Lagerfeld and Kate Moss and proudly splashing her naked body across the covers of British magazines. But at home in America, the Oregon-by-way-of-Arkansas singer is still a niche artist. That is supposed to change with <i>Music For Men</i>, her band's first studio album for Columbia. It represents Gossip's major-label coming out party, an achievement shepherded by bearded superproducer Rick Rubin.</p>
<p>The result is a good Gossip album, one that could soundtrack sweaty summer dance parties, but it also isn't drastically different from their last one. They may now have major-label money and famous friends, but their bluesy-voiced dance-punk remains unchanged-- a fact that is especially surprising given the waning popularity of that genre over the last four years. Ditto may be the ""personality"" of the band, its loud-mouthed, outrageously attired public face, but the power of its sound is anchored by Hannah Blilie's thundering, precise drumming and Brace Paine's choppy, Chic riffs. And on <i>Music For Men</i> these ""sidemen"" are in rare form with drums so taut they sound almost mechanical and pulsing, staccato basslines that call to mind Stevie Nicks' ""Edge of Seventeen"" (as on ""Heavy Cross"") and the ""Knight Rider"" theme song (as on ""Vertical Rhythm""). But fret not, Ditto-worshippers; the arrangements are meticulous but spare, leaving plenty of sonic space for her vocal pyrotechnics. In fact, it is her florid, soulful voice that gives these crisply percussive tracks their melodic kick.</p>
<p>With a lean three-person lineup and a crack rhythm section, Gossip have never really been driven by their melodies. They built their reputation on unforgiving rhythmic relentlessness and Ditto's raw, limber warble instead of on singalong anthems or hooky choruses. But there are moments on <i>Music For Men</i> that represent some of the most memorably melodic of their career. In many cases, that's because Ditto has interpolated snippets of classic hits into her throttling garage-disco tunes. ""Love Long Distance"", for instance, quotes ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine""'s ""not much longer would you be my baby"" line, and ""Men in Love"", this album's answer to the last record's gay-rights anthem of a title track, features a ""Chain of Fools""-like ""shame, shame, shame"" refrain. It makes sense that Ditto would be influenced by such soul classics, given the vintage bent of her wail, but the band also pays homage to their disco and hard-rock influences on ""2012"", a standout track that flips Kiss' ""I Was Made For Lovin' You"" into a handclap-studded disco-punk anthem that instead announces, ""My heart may never beat again, baby/ Have you got the best of me?""</p>
<p>Though longtime fans of the band may worry that they have left their DIY-punk-scene roots behind for Paris Fashion Week and pictures on Perez Hilton, <i>Music For Men</i> should assuage their fears-- not because it's not a glamorous or glitzy collection (it is), but because it sounds so much like its predecessor. Being caught between the mainstream and the underground may have changed the band's visibility, but it hasn't changed their music much. That is both a relief and little bit of a disappointment. As a musical statement of intent to the throngs of the newly interested, <i>Music For Men</i> shows a clear picture of who Gossip want to be-- a New Millennial Madonna for whom Danceteria never closes. But for those who have been following Gossip's career, waiting with bated breath to see how the band will evolve, this new record may feel a little too much like they are still <i>Standing in the Way of Control</i>.</p></div>"|13113.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13113-music-for-men/|6.4|Rebecca Raber

Good times. Too bad they didn't last very long. A few years after the release of that major-label debut, the Distillers disbanded, and Dalle spent the ensuing years popping up as a guest on her husband Josh Homme's albums with Queens of the Stone Age and Eagles of Death Metal. She announced a new outfit back in 2007, and it sounded promising: Comprised of fellow former Distiller Tony Bevilacqua, Eagle of Death Metal Alain Johannes, and ex-Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons, the new group would expand Dalle's vocal and lyrical range while mixing electric elements with familiar live punk sounds. She even negotiated her way out of her Sire contract and signed with Toronto-based Anthem Entertainment.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As the rest of the world moved forward in time, the members of Spinnerette have somehow moved backwards. Grafting programmed and live beats onto processed guitars and filtered vocals, <span>their self-titled debut</span> might have sounded edgy back in 1995, but in the here and now, it just sounds curiously redundant. This is MTV Buzz Bin nostalgia: Spinnerette could be playing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronze"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Bronze</a> (great show, crap music) or sharing a bill with Poe and Tracy Bonham. Opener ""Ghetto Love"" and ""Distorting a Code"" are Garbage without the empowering perversions, and Dalle too often sounds like any old post-Courtney howler rather than the woman who breathed fire on ""Drain the Blood"". Even the album cover recalls the Black Crowes' <i><a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/95/BlackCrowesAmoricaalbumcover.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amorica</a></i> after some airbrushing and a trip to Hot Topic.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Genre dumpster-diving of this type is not a bad thing in and of itself, and could be an interesting counterpoint to recent Ian Curtis disinterment or the Springsteen revival, which skew heavily masculine, but it's impossible to discern how self-aware Dalle and the band are in this backwards-looking undertaking. Is it a conscious throwback to and possibly a statement about a different time and style? Or is this their idea of forward-thinking hard rock circa 2010? If the latter, then it's simply a misguided project that will fall beneath the pop-culture radar before the promotional cycle has run its course.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The hidden track and what sounds like pre-Limp Bizkit turntable scratching, however, suggest the nostalgic aspect of <i>Spinnerette</i> is intentional. If so, the obvious questions arise: Why this revival? And why now? The album doesn't argue very persuasively for the source material, mistaking slick clangor for gritty production, half-assed hooks for big choruses, and blunt innuendo for authority. So, removed from that decade and placed in this one, <i>Spinnerette</i> sounds a bit sheepish. ""Ghetto Love"" sounds like CSS covering ""My Sharona"", but it's not nearly as exciting as that description might sound. ""Rebellious Palpitations"" and ""Sex Bomb"" come off like Eagles of Death Metal without the hip-shake swagger, trashy fun, or knowing wink, and closer ""A Prescription for Mankind"" aims for rock grandiosity but ODs on squealing guitars, layered vocals, and lugubrious rock ponderings.</p>
<p>Still, Dalle may yet manage to come out the other side unscathed by <i>Spinnerette</i>. She writes decent hooks on ""All Babes Are Wolves"" and the relatively sunny ""Baptized by Fire"", and on ""The Walking Dead"" she conveys a vulnerability that contrasts compellingly with her tougher sandpaper vocals-- at least until she sings, ""Hello psycho, is that you in the mirror again?"" She shows greater range than expected, but the clatter of Johannes' busy production too often obscures her charisma and renders her odd punk melodies sadly lifeless. She's better than this perplexing project.</p></div>"|13235.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13235-spinnerette/|2.7|Stephen M. Deusner

Every seemingly strange left turn from their debut, <i>Curses</i>, is stranger, carried further, and more focused and much catchier here. The band still starts and stops on a dime, the vocals are still layered and ambitious even when seething, the song titles still raise a challenging bar for the music to live up to (""Yin/Post -Yin"", ""You Need Satan More Than He Needs You""), and the low-end on the guitars still sound like angry bears. Granted, this is how both Mclusky and FOTL built the niche that drew in a loyal, fervent audience, but Travels is the sound of band who still have a lot they want to prove. <br/><br/>With a few striking exceptions, most of the keyboards from the band's debut have been ditched in favor of searing guitar tones (see ""Chin Music"" or ""Land of My Formers""). Many of the albums' hooks come from strident, almost militaristic melodies-- I doubt that ""Arming Eritrea"" is too concerned with real geography, but damned if I wouldn't help fund the revolt now after the record's screaming, indelible opening track. The woozy march of ""The Hope That House Built"" is an existentialist call-to-arms, while the mid-tempo chug of ""I Am Civil Service"" floats up a few melodic, playful bars just to shoot down with its blistering chorus. Straightforward and snarling, these tracks suggest the band still thinks modern rock might be a genre worth infiltrating and upending.<br/><br/>But about those keyboards: ""Throwing Bricks at Trains"" is a spirited pub sing along over an organ that sounds soggy with distortion. Falkous documents small-town boredom with surprising empathy and charm here (not to mention barbershop-worthy background vocals), though is a little more haunted or torn elsewhere. He's nearly theatrical on ""You Need Satan More Than He Needs You"", the most synth-heavy and yet the most pummeling track here, finding layers of neuroses in devil worship. The record loses some steam after ""Satan""; most any record probably would. They follow it up with some Saturday-morning-cartoon psychedelia on ""Yin/Post yin"", manic tales of families shamed by plastic silverware (""Stand By/Your Manatee"") and delirious amounts of guitar-string scrapes and syncopated vocals (""Drink Nike"").<br/><br/>Closer ""Lapsed Catholics"" starts out with something new for the band-- acoustic guitar-- while inscrutable joke lyrics lead into more locally-aimed bile and more existential pondering, before punctuating it all with one of the record's most titanic riffs halfway through. Throughout the album, Falkous sets up binaries in his lyrics to be tugged between: home and abroad (""when in Rome remember home is always here for you,"" he sings in ""Land of My Formers"") Satan worship and practical dress, the cynics of ""Arming Eritrea"" and the “fighters and buggers” who “have it right” in “Chin Music”, and those ""who know who they were, and who they will be again"" against those doomed to continue figuring it out in the dark (""Lapsed Catholics""). Even without these extra layers, Travels With Myself and Another might be the finest soundtrack for slam dancing, fast driving, heavy drinking, or whatever poor decision you make this year. But in addition finding new ways to snarl in their music, the lyrics go beyond mere cleverness into sharp, thoughtful introspection, making <i>Travels</i> a document of a creatively restless band out to prove something to themselves, and not just the fans they’ve picked up along the way.</p></div>"|13115.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13115-travels-with-myself-and-another/|8.0|Jason Crock

<p class=""MsoNormal"">We've been assured the Paper Chase's <i>Someday This Could All Be Yours</i> is a simpler, if not necessarily kinder record from them: ten songs, no interludes, no interstitial chit-chat. But this is a band with a sense of humor so dark it can make Xiu Xiu look like Fountains of Wayne. So, sure, it's probably the Paper Chase's most typically digestible work; it's also an exploration of humankind's futile attempts to manage itself in the face of catastrophe set to erratic squall, equal parts delirium and stone-cold sobriety.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Paper Chase's singularity is certainly something to be admired, especially when musical discussion too often boils down to ""belongs in genre X""/""sounds like bands Y &amp; Z."" When you get the itch to listen to <i>Someday</i>, nothing else is going to suffice except for maybe other Paper Chase albums. It can also be a ceiling for your enjoyment in the event you value versatility or demand that bands should always have some sort of artistic trajectory in mind: it's been three years since <i>Now You Are One of Us</i> and the only musical touch-ups are what could be a harpsichord and maybe 30 seconds of acoustic guitar.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">So yes, <i>Someday</i> still manages to be undeniably the work of the Paper Chase, a continuation of the sort of musical scrapple they've made hay on, which is to say it's completely unappetizing going only on the ingredients. The songs here are composed of nasty little things-- tingling bits of piano wire, piercing guitar squawk, flatted thirds, minor seconds. Nearly every stringed instrument gets employed for dissonance taken separately, and yet collectively they become palatable, even catchy. It's easy to give too many props to the production of John Congleton-- after all, he's done engineering work with Modest Mouse (whose whole career gets summarized in about two and a half minutes on ""The Laying of Hands, the Speaking in Tongues [The Mass Hysteria]"") as well as Antony and the Johnsons. Plus, his straitjacketed, strangulated vocals suggest a lifetime of sipping from Saddle Creek.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Yet like last time, there are plenty of sturdy, major-key melodies that go straight for the jugular. But whatever sing-along quality they have, their effectiveness is almost always determined by context. When <i>Now You Are One of Us</i>' ""Wait Until I Get My Hands on You"" pilfered the ""Father &amp; Son"" melody, it was less a homage than an act of molestation. You get something of an overt repeat on that strategy when ""The Small of Your Back, the Nape of Your Neck (The Blizzard)"" explodes into ""He's Got the Whole World in His Hands"", but more often, Congleton smears and smudges. You'd think the forceful string coda of ""If Nobody Moves, Nobody Will Get Hurt (The Extinction)"" would drive home the vocal melody, but instead, at the end of each bar, it just misses the mark by a half-step or so. By the next song, Congleton is ""drawing a bloodbath"" and ""going to heaven"" with or without you in what appears to be the record's most obvious mismanagement of U2's anthemics until the most truly anthemic song on the record recalls the chorus from ""Walk On"". It's called ""This Is a Rape (The Flood)"". Welcome to the Paper Chase's world of anthems for the misshapes and misfits.</p>

""Autumnal,"" of course, being the Queen's-- and the critics'-- preferred English for, uh, ""fall-like."" You know that song where, when people talk about the fall, Jens Lekman thinks they're talking about Mark E. Smith? Stuart Murdoch probably thinks they're talking about the Garden of Eden.</p>
<p>After all, the main character in <i>God Help the Girl</i>-- a new album of songs from the Belle and Sebastian singer/songwriter's planned musical-film project-- is called Eve. She's voiced angelically by Catherine Ireton, cover girl for the Scottish septet's ""White Collar Boy"" single and one half of a sleepy acoustic pop duo called the Go Away Birds. Ireton is one of nine singers (incuding the Divine Comedy's Neil Hannon) joining members of Belle and Sebastian for the recording, and her Irish-Zooey-Deschanel-next-door vocals have ended up gracing 10 of the set's 14 songs. But not until after an internet-wide sing-off. ""The competition was me showing a startling lack of faith in what was right in front of me, but I had to see what was out there,"" Murdoch recently told London's <i>Guardian</i>.</p>
<p>From the humble school project that became 1996 debut <i>Tigermilk</i> to the professional pop majesty of <i>The Life Pursuit</i> a decade later, the Scottish pop savant's work has been almost one leap of faith after another. Murdoch lands on solid ground again with<i> God Help the Girl</i>, which has catchy, jangling girl-group ditties aplenty, a little theatrical flourish thanks to Belle and Sebastian trumpeter Mick Cooke's orchestral arrangements, and at least one typically Murdoch-esque character, Eve. The imagery is always vivid, even when the plot isn't. From what I can tell, Ireton's bookish ingenue gives herself to the Holy Trinity: sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll. God love 'er.</p>
<p>Always one for evocative character sketches, Murdoch clearly relishes his role as demiurge of <i>God Help the Girl</i>'s self-contained universe. First single ""Come Monday Night"" is a good preview, with the wispy lilt of early Camera Obscura and a way of lingering on ""the gray of ordinariness"" long enough to show how it's lined with silvery subtleties. Like, that restless first evening between a disappointing weekend and another drab workday. The way sleep leaves a face ""crumpled and creased."" And the full rundown of Eve obsessing over some guy she likes (""Please stop me there, I'm even boring myself!""). At times, Murdoch's realistically elaborate fiction points to its own phoniness. ""Life could be musical comedy,"" suggests ""Hiding Neath My Umbrella"", a bittersweet Murdoch-Ireton duet over waltzing piano and swelling strings.</p>
<p><i>God Help the Girl</i> opens with a delicate new version of <i>The Life Pursuit</i> centerpiece ""Act of the Apostle II"". Switched from ""senior year"" to ""senior ward,"" and re-titled simply ""Act of the Apostle"", the song also drops its last verse-- making the whole thing more prologue-like-- and gains a bit of Andrews Sisters swing. For all the specifics about a sick narrator and fighting parents, ""Act of the Apostle"" is still essentially a pop kid's update of the Velvet Underground's ""Rock and Roll"": ""My Damascan road's my transistor radio."" Her life was saved by girl groups.</p>
<p>Or was it? The nuance-rich Murdoch is characteristically coy when it comes to certain details. He's mentioned musicals such as <i>Jesus Christ Superstar</i> or the original <i>Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</i> film as inspirations; my fellow 1980s babies may remember Whoopi Goldberg in <i>Sister Act</i>, where all those awesome Motown songs turned out to make real nice hymns if you did the ol' Christian rock trick and replaced ""him"" with ""Him"". So <i>The Life Pursuit</i>'s ""Funny Little Frog"", sung here by Internet contest winner Brittany Stallings, might not work as a soul song, but just think: a soul song. About someone who is everywhere, but you don't think of in a physical way. Someone you might go and visit on rainy Sundays.</p>
<p>""She was into S&amp;M and Bible studies,"" Murdoch once sang. Eve's first romantic experience is creepy, Murdoch offering to rub and scrub her during the ironically formal strings and piano of ""Pretty Eve in the Tub"". No wonder she winds up in the arms of Hannon's hammy rake on ""Perfection as a Hipster"", asking for haircare tips even as she wastes away from lack of nutrition. Asya, of Seattle teen keyboard-drums trio Smoosh, may have an even more girlish voice than Ireton's, but on ""I Just Want Your Jeans"", she's looking for boys to make her ""go, 'Ouch!'""-- heck, she's ""open to dark surprises."" And somewhere in there I just skipped a couple of totally skippable instrumentals.</p>
<p>The last two songs are among the album's most inspired. ""I'll Have to Dance With Cassie"" suggests Eve has returned to the church of rock'n'roll; now that she knows her ""dream boy"" doesn't exist, she's shimmying with a girl friend like they're a pair of boxing kangaroos. On closing number ""A Down and Dusky Blonde"", having ""fried"" her head-- another double entendre?-- Eve joins an entire sisterhood of female singers. She hasn't been getting her apple a day, so a doctor counsels, ""A woman does not live by the printed word/ Forgive yourself, and eat."" How about it, Eve?</p>
<p>""I need a friend and I choose you,"" the final song continues, with a vow to ""forget the kiss and feel."" Hmm. <i>God Help the Girl</i> is a spirited expansion of some of Murdoch's best ideas, but until the film finishes shooting-- set to <i>start</i> next year-- we'll probably just have wild-ass guesses like mine as to the real story.

I point this out because on her newest album, <i>Far</i>, Spektor alternately imitates dolphin noises, talks about making a computer out of macaroni pieces, and fashions a refrain out of repetitions of the non-word ""eet."" And that's just within the first four songs.</p>
<p>Over the course of three proper studio albums and various other tangential releases, Regina Spektor has demonstrated a solid sense of popcraft and an occasional ability to capture slices of life in charmingly non-conventional ways. More to the point, however, she's displayed an unstinting weakness for intensely self-regarding cuteness and overplayed naïveté. Despite being closer to her 40th birthday than her Sweet 16, Spektor continues to romp wide-eyed through her compositions like Sally Hawkins' perennially cheery Poppy character from the Mike Leigh film <i>Happy-Go-Lucky</i>.</p>
<p>Spektor is buoyed on <i>Far</i> by the assistance of four top-flight producers, including Mike Elizondo (Dr. Dre, Eminem), Jacknife Lee (Bloc Party, Snow Patrol) and, oh yeah, Jeff Freaking Lynne. As you'd expect from such an impressive roll call, the album's sonics are exceptionally clean and tastefully tailored, from Lynne's moving string swells on ""Blue Lips"" to the eminently radio-friendly hook on the Elizondo-helmed ""The Calculation"" to the Beatles-y brass touches on ""Two Birds"" (courtesy, surprisingly enough, not of Lynne but of Lee).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all this talent behind the boards often feels like a waste because of Spektor's inability to let her songs stand on their own merits without the persistent interjection of vocal curlicues or verbal flights of fancy. Notice how she ladles awful oversinging onto ""Blue Lips"" and ""Human of the Year"", or tries to put on some kind of robo-Germanic accent for the refrain to the horribly lumbering ""Machine"". I have no doubt these little whimsical flourishes go over like gangbusters in concert, but on a fifth or 10th or 20th listen to a studio album, how many people are really not going to cringe at these affectations?</p>
<p>Certainly it's easy to chalk up these eccentricities to Spektor's quirky ""personality"" (which belongs in scare quotes because god knows being quirky doesn't guarantee you have an interesting personality), but frequently they feel like a defense mechanism as well. After all, cuteness is a terrific tool for allowing anyone to get away with being trite, which probably goes a long way towards explaining why a song like the first single, ""Laughing With"", seems almost trenchant at first blush, yet upon closer scrutiny unravels into pure meaningless mush, a nattering scold that woefully misreads atheism and agnosticism, ticking off a list of boilerplate crises (war, poverty, a missing child) and reminding us that no one laughs at God in these situations, as though non-believers spend the majority of their tragedy-free time busting on the Almighty.</p>
<p>""Dance Anthem of the 80's"" is emblematic of Spektor flashing genuine wit and emotional power yet being unable to get out of her own way. At one point Spektor almost off-handedly intones, ""And it's been a long time since before I've been touched/ Now I'm getting touched all the time,"" and it's an undeniably stirring moment, yet it never has a chance to thrive, not when it's contending with Spektor mawkishly cooing, ""you are so sweet,"" while stretching and trilling the word ""sleep"" at the end of each refrain to an almost unbelievably obnoxious degree. I like to imagine that somewhere 19-year-old Taylor Swift hears this song and shakes her head, wondering when Regina Spektor is ever going to grow up.</p></div>"|13184.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13184-far/|4.8|Joshua Love

He spent some time running with the Youngbloodz and recorded an album with one-time Lil Jon signee Bohagon that was never released, but these days he mostly pays the bills selling hooks to more-successful rappers (T.I.'s ""Slide Show"", for example) alongside his also-way-more-famous compatriot Bobby Ray (aka B.o.B.). His long list of setbacks seems to have both humbled and focused him, however, and over the past year, he has released two increasingly ambitious and introspective full-length mixtapes full of all-original beats that grapple honestly and engagingly with his growing despair and frustration. Last year's <i>Goodbye America</i> was a bitter farewell to a country that had done nothing for him, while <i>Liquor Store Mascot</i> is an even more personal affair, detailing his struggles with alcohol. His frivolous rap name is a remnant of his more carefree youth, and it feels like a misnomer now; he can be hilarious, but Playboy Tre is emphatically not playing. On ""Before I Go"", he lays it all on the table: ""I'm the man behind the raps, but I'm way older than your average/ Fuck, I'm in my thirties, got a nephew named Josh, another nephew named Dave who I'd kill for any day/ And I don't have kids even though I'm past due/ Said I'd never do abortion, but I did that shit, too.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This kind of disarming candor is what helps make <i>Liquor Store Mascot</i> a memorable tour of the view from Tre's barstool. ""I ain't scared to tell the world I'm a drunk, man, cuz this is me,"" he raps on the title track, the perfectly phrased and delivered chorus of which goes, ""You know I do it for the have-nots/ And keep an ice-cold beer like I'm the liquor store mascot."" His fondness for booze, and the self-deprecating way he raps it, have led to some Devin the Dude comparisons, which is a fair starting point, but the different between Devin and Playboy is also the difference between a stoner and a drunk; even when he gets dark, Devin never seems more than a beat or two away from dissolving into giggles, where as even when Tre's joking, the tension and buried hurt is audible in his voice. Part of this comes from the Georgia salt of his accent, but it's also in the flatly nasal, sardonic way he wields it: ""<i>Lo</i>rd bless the <i>pe</i>ople at the <i>bot</i>tom of the <i>bo</i>ttle, word to Gil Scott,"" he raps on ""Living in the Bottle"", spitting out each syllable through gritted teeth over an interpolation of Heron's ""The Bottle"". Like all drunks, his recollections are equally funny and sad: ""Pop hit that liquor, his attitude would switch up/ Started kicking niggas out, and tell 'em, 'take that ugly bitch with ya'"", he remembers later on ""Bottle"".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Luckily, Tre doesn't devote the whole mixtape rapping about drinking. On ""Sideways"", he brings the same narrative clarity and immediacy to recounting dead-end meetings with record executives and staying up till 4 a.m. trying to write songs in a bare apartment. On ""Oh My Lord Freestyle"", he kicks hilariously nasty sex raps and swagger over uptempo gospel clapping. And on the powerfully evocative ""Bleachers"", he raps with breathless reverence over an echoing ""boom-boom clap"" beat and a single ghostly keyboard about staying late at school, ""in an empty gym, beatin' on bleachers, trying to get my lyrics right.""  The song captures the simple joy of rhyming so beautifully-- ""I got a song that the block 'bout to hear tonight!"" he crows at one point-- that it should warm the heart of even the most cantankerous hip-hop nerd.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As mentioned, the mixtape is composed of all original beats, and truly, if Tre can put together a record this appealing and sonically varied for free with no record deal, than no one with even a paltry label budget behind them has the slightest excuse anymore. ""Liquor Store Mascot"", produced by Phantom, piles Mannie Fresh trumpet fanfares over Shawty Redd-style pizzicato strings; ""If This World Was Mine"" is a warm chipmunk-soul loop worthy of pre-<i>College Dropout</i> Kanye; and ""Livin In the Bottle""'s Gil Scott-Heron sample is lush and seamless enough to recall ""Stay Fly"". ""Everybody's Lookin for Something"" even manages to find a fresh angle on the Eurythmics' ""Sweet Dreams"". Sure, there is a slightly cheesy song with Bobby Ray about how we are all like robots, really, when you think about it, and yeah, ""Remember Me"" features a hook sung by who I'm pretty sure is the lead singer of Evanescence, but for the most part, Playboy Tre has managed, with no label support, pu

For every rager about pioneering gospel singer Sister Rosetta Tharpe's deserved place in the pantheon, and for how much Noisettes singer Shingai Shoniwa channeled the rowdiest chicks to ever rock a mic, the strong magnetic lure of assembly-line modern rock pulled the album toward the same bland end of the spectrum that claimed CSS last year. But for their second album, <i>Wild Young Hearts</i>, the gang seems to have landed on ""Yeah Yeah Yeahs"" on the career-path-Wheel of Fortune, and chose to compress that trio's time frame-- sneaking in the dance jam with the ""Maps"" and ""Cheated Hearts"". Sure, <i>Wild</i>'s cracks are still caulked in with variations of 2007's theme. But if Noisettes' goal for the album was to be better and more adventurous than the debut while retaining the awesomeness of their meal ticket frontwoman, they nailed it.</p>
<p>At her best, Shoniwa establishes and then pushes through her fears, and her optimism and strong vocals combine to make opener ""Sometimes"" the band's best song yet. It's a simple folk piece with a sunny melody and optimistic disposition, but once it gets taken to church after the first chorus, it becomes clear that good things could happen if someone would introduce her to Mark Ronson. On their own, though, the band's retro-curiosity is more often than not matched with pop savvy, making for a solid record and a few downright good songs. ""Every Now and Then"", ""Never Forget You"", and ""24 Hours"" brush up effectively against 1960s soul, lacing in modern flourishes without overdoing them. The title track is a spry, jazzy singalong that, to its credit, stays on its tracks when the mall-punk guitars burst through the doors on the chorus. ""Atticus"" is a muted groover that lets Shoniwa get her Harper Lee on for a minute. For its part, latest single ""Saturday Night""... wait, is that a whiff of electroclash?</p>
<p>No one's perfect, I guess, especially when they're trying to go from one-note to every note in the space of a single record. Sadly, though, that means that the dancier stuff, though I want to like it <i>so much</i>, is <i>Wild</i>'s main casualty. Though everyone in the UK seems to love ""Don't Upset the Rhythm"", I can't get past the uninspiring use of citations. The title predicts its spiritual foundation, Rihanna's much hotter and not-yet-stale ""Don't Stop the Music"" (which itself isn't really reinventing the wheel). The title phrase shares space with the chant ""go baby, go baby, go!"", a geeky throwback to another pop-punk girl aiming to colonize the dancefloor. The song doesn't make me dance, or want to dance, as much as it makes me think of people dancing in television commercials. But hey, Noisettes are young, and especially if their third album represents as much of a leap over the second as <i>Wild</i> does from <i>Wolf</i>, they'll nail it soon enough. The onus is on Shoniwa, though: Once she overcomes the fundamental irony of possessing a strong visual and vocal presence without a coherent identity, there's no way we'll be able to stop her.</p></div>"|13212.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13212-wild-young-hearts/|6.7|Eric Harvey

Tempting, but wrong-- two years after its release, it still sounds great, on par with the early, hallowed triumvirate of <i>Dinosaur</i>, <i>You're Living All Over M</i>e, and <i>Bug</i>. For any cynics still chalking <i>Beyond</i> up to luck, <i>Farm</i> should blast the scales from your jaded eyes. Energetic, confident, and catchy, it's even more compelling than <i>Beyond.</i></p>
<p>It certainly boasts more stick-in-your-head tunes than <i>Beyond</i>, or virtually any other Dinosaur Jr. album. Who knows why J Mascis writes better songs when Lou Barlow and Murph are around-- maybe there's something to the old cliché of ""chemistry,"" maybe the pair just know how to push his tunes from solid up to stellar. But whatever creates this spark, it's spurred Mascis to pack <i>Farm </i>with riff-heavy slacker classics that rival past gems like ""Little Fury Things"" and ""Freak Scene"". Opener ""Pieces"" is a vintage display of Dinosaur Jr.'s knack for grafting unruly riffage to unabashedly bittersweet choruses. The lumbering ""I Want You to Know"" follows with chunky chords that sound both heavy and bright. As David Raposa pointed out in his <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11236-i-want-you-to-know/"" target=""_blank"">recent track review</a>, the tune is impressively assured, as if Mascis has shed the need to add an apologetic tone to his guitar anthems.</p>
<p>But even when Mascis is lyrically mopey, the music pulls this sad sack up off the couch. Take the caffeinated chug of slacker-self-help guide ""Over It"". ""Can I make it here?/ Get over it,"" Mascis tells himself. ""I've been feeling weird/ Get over it... I've been on the fence/ Now it's making sense I see."" Even better is the pity-filled ""Plans"". The man who Thurston Moore imagined as Slacker President in Sonic Youth's ""Teen Age Riot"" moans about pain, loss, and apathy-- ""I've got nothing left to be/ Do you have some plans for me?"" But the music's adrenalized bounce makes his misery more sweet than sad. In <i>Farm</i>'s world, a good melody cures all ills.</p>
<p>As catchy and well-crafted as these songs are, they never feel restricted or overly polished. Each track is given room to grow, stretching into extended intros, impulsive solos, and oft-repeated verses. The result is both shapely and sprawling, like the mossy cartoon characters on the album cover. The aching ""Said the People"" seems to climax with Mascis' crying solo in the middle, but then spreads out into another great three minutes. ""I Don't Wanna Go There"" sprawls into fuzzy detonations, like a mellowed version of <i>Bug</i>'s noise-bomb ""Don't"". And Barlow approaches his two excellent songs with similar openness, hitting especially hard on the dark ""Your Weather"".</p>
<p>With <i>Farm</i> coming out around the same time as the first installment in Neil Young's <i>Archive</i><i>s</i> project, it's tempting to make a grand statement about Mascis and Dinosaur Jr. as heirs to the Young and Crazy Horse throne. Young's genius is pretty inimitable, but there is something about this band-- the way they mix noisy guitar and punk-ish slam with sugared melodies and faded choruses-- that's Young-worthy. And as long as J, Lou, and Murph keep shooting as high as <i>Farm</i>, they'll end up with the kind of discography worth buying over and over again.</p></div>"|13109.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13109-farm/|8.5|Marc Masters

But team player that he is, there's only so much space for Hood's material on each Drive-By Truckers disc, making room for partner in crime Mike Cooley and now contributions from bassist Shonna Tucker as well. It's a balance that pays off, too: last year's <i>Brighter Than Creation's Dark</i> was sprawling and diverse-- and possibly the group's best record.</p>
<p>Still, there's the matter of that backlog of songs, and churning out solo albums doesn't seem to be Hood's M.O. But even if it were, saying you're going to get it done apparently doesn't make doing it any easier. Hood's ostensible solo debut, 2004's <i>Killers and Stars</i>, was made three years before its belated release, as a form of what Hood branded ""therapy."" Yet that's nothing compared to the set of songs that comprise <i>Murdering Oscar (and Other Love Songs)</i>, Hood's second album, whose origins stretch back even further than his previous solo disc. One case in point: ""Heavy and Hanging"", which was written in response to Kurt Cobain's 1994 suicide.</p>
<p>That year also marked Hood's relocation to Athens, Georgia, from his home in Alabama, setting in motion the events that would lead to the Drive-By Truckers. Plenty of things have happened to Hood since then, including a new marriage, fatherhood, and the gradual success of the DBTs, and all these things inform <i>Murdering Oscar</i> to some degree. Even the musicians backing Hood offer a sort of career overview, from fellow Truckers Brad Morgan, Cooley, and Tucker and longtime associate John Neff to producer and Athens staple David Barbe to frequent tourmates Will Johnson and Scott Danbom of Centro-matic, and finally to dad David Hood, legendary Muscle Shoals session bassist. Even the name of Hood's new label, Ruth St., refers to the address of the apartment he and a friend shared when he first moved to Georgia and began work on this record some 15 years ago.</p>
<p>That said, this is hardly the stuff of either nostalgia or what one imagines a Truckers disc full of Hood-only songs would sound like. To his credit Hood has collected 13 tracks that, for whatever reason, hang together well. If anything, the title track (inspired by Woody Allen's <i>Crimes and Misdemeanors</i>) and ""Heavy and Hanging"" (which is paired with the Crazy Horse-y ""Walking Around Sense"", which may be taking aim at Courtney Love's parenting skills) are among the album's darker moments. The rest largely feature Hood sometimes mirthful, sometimes rueful, but always surprisingly sanguine, even mature, in the way he addresses life's ups and downs.</p>
<p>""Pollyanna"", for example, the oldest song on the album, was written as Hood realized his marriage and band Adam's House Cat (which he formed with Cooley before the two reconnected in the Truckers) were both falling apart, but the song's a genial classic rock nugget, while ""Foolish Young Bastard"", a put-down aimed at an old manager, comes off oddly forgiving and <i>c'est la vie</i> optimistic rather than mean-spirited. ""Screwtopia"" was written as a sardonic portrait of suburban domestic tranquility, and seems almost wistful (at least until Hood suggests his hypothetical wife take a few more pills to ease her worries, and gives his son a loaded gun to play with).</p>
<p>On the domestic front, Hood's life has turned out better than he predicted all those years ago, at least if his post-marriage and fatherhood tracks are any indication. The moving ""Pride of the Yankees"" is Hood throwing his protective arms around his newborn child in a post-9/11 world, while ""Grandaddy"" finds him fast forwarding several more years to a time when he can spoil his future descendants with candy hidden around the house. The poppy ""I Understand Now"" is Hood happy and content, ""She's a Little Randy"" is Hood in a silly (and, um, sexy) mood, and ""Back of a Bible"" is a love song to his wife the singer literally scribbled in the final blank pages of a motel's good book while out on tour.</p>
<p>Nothing here totally upends what we already know of Hood's talents via the Truckers, but it does serve as a supplementary  capsule capturing how he ticks, right down to his cover of the <i>Runt</i>-era Todd Rundgren proto alt-country gem ""The Range War"", a response to anyone that, in Hood's words, thinks all he does is ""sit around and listen to Molly Hatchet."" What it and the originals on <i>Murdering Oscar</i> do is emphasize Hood's respect for and attraction to lyrical and emotional honestly above all else, the universals that have linked a lot of good music from the past to present. With every note, with every song, Hood sounds like he increasingly, if modestly, recognizes he's part of that great songwriting continuum, working hard to live up to his end of the obligation, as long as it takes.</p></div>"|13106.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13106-murdering-oscar-and-other-love-songs/|7.6|Joshua Klein

Artists such as Alela Diane, Marissa Nadler, Jana Hunter, and Mariee Sioux have issued a steady stream of quality music, and have collectively set a fairly high standard for newcomers to match. Yet on her debut full-length album, <i>Because I Was in Love</i>, Brooklyn's Sharon Van Etten proves that she has the expressive voice and the songwriting chops to ably hold her own in the company of her peers.</p>
<p>As with the aforementioned artists, Van Etten's work retains some echoes of folk tradition but generally operates in a more personal, introspective space. Following a number of hand-designed and self-released recordings, a 2008 tour with Meg Baird brought Van Etten into the orbit of Philadelphia's Espers, whose Greg Weeks recorded <i>Because I Was in Love</i> at Hexham Head studio. With Weeks' veteran assistance, Van Etten keeps the album's arrangements minimal and direct, augmenting her voice and guitar with only the occasional splash of organ, brushed cymbals, or multi-tracked vocal harmonies.</p>
<p>Though the arrangements are spare, the performances on <i>Because I Was in Love</i> are not skeletal-- these are full-bodied songs that sound finished, as though Van Etten had already lived with this material long enough to know intuitively how best to present it. In this regard Van Etten's work can resemble Chan Marshall's earliest Cat Power recordings, especially in the way that Van Etten's confident, nuanced soprano is able to help temper the emotional fragility of her material.</p>
<p>As the title suggests, <i>Because I Was In Love</i> spends most of its time chronicling the bittersweet ache and light-headed confusion that can only arise through the ebbs and flows of romance. Unlike some low-key vocalists who prefer to sing as if nobody were listening, Van Etten instead sings these songs as though she had an audience of one, with nearly every lyric directed straight to some unnamed ""you."" And, at the risk of conflating the performer with her performance, suffice to say that throughout the album Van Etten really nails it, sounding every bit like someone trying to get her head around a complex and evolving relationship.</p>
<p>On opener ""I Wish I Knew"" or the sumptuous ""Much More Than That"", Van Etten writes with such intimacy (her lyrics filled with direct lines like, ""I wish I knew what to do with you,"" or ""Please don't take me lightly"") that the listener gets an almost disconcerting sense of eavesdropping on a private conversation. Elsewhere, as on ""Tornado"" or the captivating ""Consolation Prize"", Van Etten sounds more reflective, keeping a measured distance from her narratives, even if her songs' ultimate conclusions (""The moral of the story is don't lie to me again"") recognize the impossibility of pat endings and easy solutions.</p>
<p>Most crucial to the album's success, however, is Van Etten's unerring sense for crafting memorable, seductive melodies. Here again she takes no shortcuts, as she largely forgoes standard verse-chorus repetition in favor of a more organic style, with wonderful songs like ""For You"" and ""Holding Out"" gently unwinding like the lines across a hand-drawn road map. Even in a folk scene that can sometimes feel over-crowded, <i>Because I Was in Love</i> positions Sharon Van Etten immediately towards the front of the pack.</p></div>"|13226.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13226-because-i-was-in-love/|7.7|Matthew Murphy

The album's producer is Greg Saunier from Deerhoof, who took on the band after Bavafa sent him some demos, including ""Hejrat"", their reinterpretation of a song by the controversial Iranian pop singer Googoosh. (The ""Hejrat"" 7"" landed Sholi in the 2008 Music Issue of <i>The Believer</i>.) Live, they are given to performing epic renditions of Joanna Newsom's ""Sprout and the Bean"". Translation: these are some brainy fellows, and if all of this background info didn't adequately prepare you for an album of proggy guitar suites with constantly shifting time signatures, then you probably just weren't paying close enough attention.</p>
<p>Luckily, as far as proggy guitar suites go, these are some lovely, liquid compositions. ""All That We Can See"" opens the album with a perfumed gust of sound, as drummer Jonathon Bafus tosses little fills everywhere like sputtering wires, and then a guitar line vaguely reminiscent of Radiohead's ""Knives Out"" surfaces. From there, the song shifts abruptly from acoustic strumming to full-bore jamming to round-robin vocal chanting, but the descending guitar figure holds everything together, the rhythmic and harmonic anchor tugging the song to Earth as it threatens, repeatedly, to float away.</p>
<p>This back-and-forth between structure and aimlessness characterizes most of <i>Sholi</i>, which accounts for both its strengths and its weaknesses. The way the album is sequenced-- more a series of interrelated vignettes than songs, each track melting quietly into the next-- gives the album a nicely hazy, lucid-dream quality. The problem, simply put, is that most every song sounds the same. Sholi are clearly aiming for an immersive experience, but it can't be a good sign that I had to keep shaking myself to note the vanishing points between songs, or that I had to isolate ""November Through June"" five or six times to realize it was the one with the catchy chorus.</p>
<p>Bavafa's limpid, somewhat bland tenor unfortunately contributes to the eye-glaze factor. For all the vitality of the music-- whether it's Bafus subdividing beats into hailstorms of counter-rhythms on ""Dance for Hours"" or the doleful waltz of ""Spy in the House of Memories""-- Bavafa's mournful singing, which never alters tone or grain, does a pretty thorough job of smoothing it all out. Bafus is the band's secret weapon; his rhythmically restless and effortlessly virtuosic drumming manages to power the songs single-handedly and somehow paradoxically stay out of their way. And Bavafa has a good chemistry with him, building an improbably feather-light song on top of his clomping, stop-start 5/4 beat on ""Tourniquet"". But when Bafus isn't pushing from the back, everything falls slack, and the album blurs into gray. Individual moments stand out, but <i>Sholi</i> isn't an album you immerse yourself in as much as notice from time to time.</p></div>"|13060.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13060-sholi/|6.4|Jayson Greene

A deep catalog-- one that shows more refinement than reinvention over the past 10 years-- means the band's stuck with its cult. But that's actually got to be a pretty comforting idea in 2009, as any overworked young buzz band approaching onstage breakdown before album two can tell you.</p>
<p>Still: What about when Saint Etienne was new, maybe even a potential commercial prospect? Listen to this new reissue of the band's debut album, 1991's <i>Foxbase Alpha</i> and you'll hear that, then as now, Saint Etienne made lovely, accessible music. But <i>Foxbase</i> is also far closer to capital-P pop than the band's recent refined blend of exuberance and melancholy. So why didn't I hear Saint Etienne songs like <i>Foxbase</i>'s ""Nothing Can Stop Us"" and ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart""-- both <i>Billboard</i> #1s on the dance charts-- burbling from communal boomboxes in eighth grade?</p>
<p>One theory for why Saint Et stiffed in the States is also a big part of the band's draw to many fans: The potentially limiting pleasures of Anglophilia. So yes, <i>Foxbase</i> is littered with odd, musty little samples from odd, musty Olde England, and beats from the highly polished dancefloors of contemporary London. In fact, Pitchfork contributor Tom Ewing once wrote <a href=""http://freakytrigger.co.uk/ft/2000/04/proper-london-saint-etienne-foxbase-alpha/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a wonderful essay</a> that suggested <i>Foxbase</i> was best understood as a musical embodiment of the whole vibe of late 20th-century UK living, including, but not limited to, the mix of chic, glossy multi-cultural collisions and grubby, hospitably lived-in neighborhoods that made up London itself. (A brief break to get some conflict of interest stuff out of the way: A) The aforementioned Mr. Ewing contributes an essay to the liner notes of the <i>Foxbase</i> reissue, and B) Saint Etienne member Bob Stanley has contributed to Pitchfork. If either of those things stick in your craw while reading the more-or-less gush that follows, well, sorry.)</p>
<p>Another reason Saint Etienne never hit with a U.S. mass audience? While the likes of Snap! and Crystal Waters made big-budget dance records with an urbane sheen, records that would work in any capital city club around the world, Foxbase Alpha's sonics had a DIY edge, an underground-gone-mainstream bulletin from a very specific milieu. Albeit one that can still be enjoyed by anyone not predisposed to hate the soft, the sunny, the lilting, the laid-back, and the mildly twee. Foxbase is on one level a UK indie pop record with a particularly unique sound and vision-- the joys and pangs of cusp-of-adulthood love and loss, delivered with a clued-in-ingenue mix of wide-eyed enthusiasm and knowing languor by Sarah Cracknell, set to a backing stitched from the gentler side of pop history by studio whizzes Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs. It's just a unique indie pop record that happened to bump to a bright pop pulse.</p>
<p>What's funny about bringing up the always divisive p-word is that I remember some big-name 90s dance producers actually dissing Saint Etienne by calling the band ""bubblegum."" We can assume those producers meant Saint Etienne erred too much on the indie side, sacrificing dancefloor kick. But much like the Anglophilic fantasy world the band conjures, that split allegiance is another part of Saint Etienne's specific appeal. <i>Foxbase</i> tracks like ""Spring"" and the cover of Neil Young's ""Only Love Can Break Your Heart"" do indeed sound like heart-on-sleeve pop kids (in the C86 sense) trying their quite adroit hands at lounge-y hip-house and piano-driven disco.</p>
<p>But several of <i>Foxbase's</i> best tunes move past adding idiosyncratic touches to off-the-rack uptempo 4/4 rhythms, and into something more unique and beguiling. The drowsy, heartsick ballad ""Carnt Sleep"" sounds like a humid summer spent spinning Sarah Records 7""s back to back with Sade, slick soul secretly slid into an indie-friendly sleeve. Or there's the Cocteau Twins-ian shivers of ""London Belongs to Me"", with its smitten, multi-tracked Cracknell crooning to herself across a diamond sea of piano chords. Assured but approachable, these club-informed but not quite club-ready songs offered a wholly other kind of ""indie dance"" from the previous punk-funk generation or the cheap-and-easy preset-punching remixes of the blog-house era, something like careful cursive on pastel paper compared to blurry cut-and-paste photocopies or generic computer typeface.""</p>
<p><i>Foxbase</i> squeezes so many ""lighter side of"" sounds-- be they from the worlds of rock, dance, soul, whatever-- into one LP that it's a marvel it sounds so unified, mostly owing to Wiggs and Stanley fixing on the platonic house rhythm as the glue to hold their disparate passions together. But the second disc of bonus tracks often feels like two producers still figuring out how to make the raw materials of post-acid house their own. A grab-bag of late 80s/early 90s rave sonics-- only sometimes processed through what we know as the Saint Etienne idiom-- dates much of the material. ""Chase HQ"" and ""Speedwell"" are competent but sketchy early UK house singles, full of jittery samples and keyboard stabs. Fun, but ultimately too generic without Cracknell's voice or the sample-choice oddness and studio chops Wiggs and Stanley would bring to the band's later music. Better is the dub playground chant of ""Sally Space"", Cracknell humming ""Iko Iko"" through a quiet storm front of classic ambient house textures, the Orb with a dose of girl-pop glee.</p>
<p>Speaking of the p-word (again): <i>Continental</i>, a previously Japan-only odds-and-ends collection reissued in the same batch of Saint Et records as this new <i>Foxbase</i>, works as a sort of mirror image of <i>Too Young to Die</i>, the band's almost absurdly listenable 1995 singles compilation. If the all-hits uniformity of <i>TYTD</i> represents Saint Etienne's final, most obvious stab at <i>Now That's What I Call Pop</i> immortality, then <i>Continental</i> is the beginning of the more wide-ranging (and hit-or-miss) restlessness that's characterized the band's records from 1998's <i>Good Humor</i> onward. Each track is recognizably Saint Etienne-- Cracknell's inimitable winsome-but-grown-and-sexy coo announces that, if nothing else-- but the tracks (frequently darker, often instrumental) go very different places than the uniform, bubbly house-lite of <i>Foxbase</i>'s uptempo moments.</p>
<p>So much so that when legit UK hit ""He's on the Phone""-- not coincidentally the only track <i>Continental</i> shares with <i>Too Young to Die</i>-- shimmers into earshot, it's such a glittering throwback to the old Saint Etienne that it nearly skews the vibe of the whole collection. ""He's on the Phone"" is Saint Et's most deliriously <i>normal</i> single, a go-for-broke attempt at the kind of high-test mainstream house that still appears on comps with ""Ibiza"" unironically in their titles. The rest of <i>Continental</i> offers another of Saint Etienne's seemingly paradoxical combos. It's far more subdued, even reflective, than <i>Foxbase</i>'s unashamedly hooks-first buoyancy. But it's also sonically ""big"" in a way that makes it seem like a commentary on the mid-90s moment when even chill-out-centric electronic music went stadium-sized.</p>
<p>""Burnt Out Car"" and ""Stormtrooper in Drag"" have, respectively, the kind of thick and fluffy prog-house keyboards and crashing drums you could imagine Underworld or Orbital using to whip a festival audience into a frenzy, a far cry from the ""made in your friend's flat"" scale of <i>Foxbase</i>. The effect of this surface-level bigness in Saint Et's hands is decidedly different, though, than in those their Glastonbury-headling contemporaries. It's the sound of the band's blithe young lovers suddenly forced to grow up as money and traditional notions of glamor infiltrate their imagined world. Even as they age, though, and club-life-as-permanent-playground gives way to club-life-as-vector-for-adult-pain, Saint Etienne's cast of characters retain an unrepentant sentimental streak, one not so much obliterated by experience as deepened by it. ""Groveley Road"" and ""Suburban Autumn Lieutenant"" exude a vibe of poignant longing that's hammy as hell-- it takes guts to include an image as blatant as ""the season has changed"" in a song about the dissipation of love-- but also wholly convincing if you go with it.</p>
<p>While listening to these reissues during an oppressively gloomy, rain-sodden East Coast springtime, I also re-read Martin Amis' <i>London Fields</i>, a vision of the city as the second millennium drew to a close that's almost <i>Foxbase</i>'s inverse: A world of venal yuppies, reprehensible con-men, and lost souls who've long since given up on love. Saint Etienne's heart-on-sleeve protagonists (and audience) were too earnest to conceivably survive a day in such an overwhelmingly beaten-down environment. The sort of ""decaying violent reality of the harsh urban etcetera"" that Mr. Ewing's essay suggests Saint Et caught shit for ""ignoring.""<br><br>Equally fantastical, Amis' all-ugly-all-the-time London is also Anglophilic catnip, just the kind that tends to impress the sort of American who prefers sardonic ""we're all fucked"" loathing to idealism or nostalgia. Grossly sentimental as it may sound, though, at the moment I'll take <i>Foxbase</i>'s imaginary year-round summer, where it's ""too warm to even hold hands"" but the rush and flush of first-love makes it too tempting to resist. There's enough doom-mongering waiting for me when I open the BBC News website every morning to not enjoy a little escapism.</br></br></p></div>"|13058.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13058-foxbase-alpha-continental/|8.7|Jess Harvell

Guitarist and Sun City Girls founder Richard Bishop has a fluid and not overly nerdy mastery of a shit-ton of musical styles. Dude can improvise or play intricate compositions; he can go slow and weird or fast as fuck; he can play like he's at a Turkish funeral or Hindu religious ceremony or Western swing wedding, do a perfect Django-esque tune at breakneck speed, and then pull off a dirty bar-band take on ""Radar Love"". It's only when you take in all of it that you get close to what Bishop's own style is: he's a shape-shifter, plain and simple. As soon as you have him figured out and pinned down, he's well onto the next thing. Even the most casual fan will warn that you never quite know what you're going to get.</p>
<p>This time out, Bishop jettisons the guitar soli approach that's defined the majority of his solo stuff. But he does so only after first clobbering the listener with a magnificent example of the form, ""Taqasim For Omar"". The Omar in question on this particular guitar improvisation is the late Egyptian guitarist Omar Khorshid, whom Bishop credits in interviews as a major inspiration for this whole project. One minute into the second track, ""Enta Omri"", we're introduced to the Freak of Araby Ensemble, where they tastefully lay down tablas, bass, and doubled-up guitar until the final number, ""Blood-Stained Sands"", which is all reeds (Moroccan chanter horns) and percussion.</p>
<p>Half the songs on <i>The Freak of Araby</i> are covers of Middle Eastern tunes, and the other half are originals. Bishop is half-Lebanese, so it's tempting to see this as some kind of ""back to the roots"" affair. In the Detroit suburb where he grew up, Rick and his brother Alan were exposed to a lot of Middle Eastern music; their grandfather used to play the oud and a double-reeded flute as well as records by the likes of Fairuz and Oum Kalthoum. If you hear echoes of Morricone or surf music here, that makes sense-- pretty much any time you amplify Middle Eastern jams you realize how far that approach to sound has reached. You hear the Morricone because both Bishop and Morricone are masters at synthesizing disparate sounds from different cultures; too bad they've never gotten to collaborate.</p>
<p>The band, consisting of guitarist Rasheed Al-Qahira, percussionist Mohammed Bandari, bassist Ahmed Sharif, and hand drummer Abdulla Basheem, is ace. It's true that a few songs could be a tad dirtier, more unhinged; undoubtedly they will in performance (at the time of this writing Bishop's on a North American tour with the group). Bishop's take on the lovely Corsican melody ""Solenzara"", for example, never leaves the earth, but it's not supposed to. That happens enough on the original ""Sidi Mansour"", anyway. Then there's the knotty yet hummable ""Barbary"", which has echoes of the Sun City Girls' <i>Torch of the Mystics</i>. Like that record, <i>Freak</i> is one of Bishop's most cohesive and accessible albums. Since it also has such an NPR-friendly backstory, expect Bishop to appear on Terry Gross soon. Which means you can also expect a record composed entirely of synth dirge nursery rhymes about circumcision next time around. That, or a Sammy Davis, Jr. tribute record. Or both!</p></div>"|13057.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13057-the-freak-of-araby/|7.8|Mike McGonigal

The Chicago quartet's individual elements-- particularly the Hope Sandoval-ish vocals of Marie-Claire Balabanian and the syrupy bass of Karl Briedrick-- were solid. But there was something passive about the proceedings. Thoroughly relaxed and mellow, the album suggested that not only could Speck Mountain do this in their sleep, but they'd prefer to.</p>
<p>As <i>Some Sweet Relief</i>'s opening tracks waft from the speakers, Speck Mountain seem content to continue that passivity. Agreeable melodies, swaying tempos, and reverberating chords float by, sprinkling sonic dust on your eyelids. That drowsy mood persists in the lyrics of track four, ""I Feel Eternal"". ""Close your eyes/ Let your dreams pass my way,"" hums a meditative Balabanian. But musically, things have changed. With its bending bassline, chiming lead guitar, and horn-section accents, ""I Feel Eternal"" gives the album<i> </i>a gentle but tangible kick, one that propels the band forward the rest of the way.</p>
<p>This subtle ascension seems to come from an injection of soul. As <i>Some Sweet Relief </i>progresses, song structures lean toward the realm of spirituals and blues, and Balabanian's supine purr begins to feel more classic. You won't mistake Speck Mountain for a gospel group, but it's fair to say that, at least during the album's second half, they sound more like Spiritualized than Mazzy Star. Take the phasey organ of the aching ""Backslider"", which seems ghostwritten by Sonic Boom, or the slow croon of its partner track ""Backsliding"", whose staircase-climb has a distinct Jason Pierce tint circa ""Shine a Light"". It all leads to another sharp peak, ""Twinlines"", whose simple chorus-- ""Oh, how long,"" delivered in a pretty Balabanian moan-- belongs distinctly to this band.</p>
<p>Speck Mountain still have some distance to travel before they fill an album with such moments, so that whenever you hear their music, you think of them first rather than their influences. But this is only their second full-length, and it's a solid step in that direction. Though they seem dedicated to their musical equivalent of lying on the grass and looking for shapes in the clouds, there's no law that says mellowness can't reach as high as energy-- especially when, as with Speck Mountain, it's permanently aimed towards the sky.</p></div>"|12915.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12915-some-sweet-relief/|6.1|Marc Masters

DJ Quik's two-decade career has established him as one of the  genre's great recording artists, but his maturation from teenage  Compton DJ to a complex embodiment of California post-gangster party  rap doesn't have much cachet in a hip-hop history that celebrates only winners. Quik's  music feels increasingly undervalued; being known as the ultimate ""underrated"" West Coast rapper-producer has become a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy.  His latest record, a joint effort with Dogg Pound rapper Kurupt entitled <i> BlaQKout, </i>finds the producer at his most creatively restless, forgoing  the comfortable up-tempo dance beats of his late-90s peak for a style  much more difficult to pin down. Each track feels unique; the producer  sounds eager to push his own internal boundaries and subvert his stylistic quirks. But what makes this riskier record successful is also  what makes it cohesive: it is a very fun album.</p>
<p>Kurupt's career is similarly  undervalued, albeit on a smaller scale; a rapper raised in Philly and  famous in L.A., he bridged the cerebral, technical detachment of the  East Coast with the West's gangster swagger and confrontational demeanor,  before blasting off in more avant directions for his 2001 record, <i> Space Boogie: Smoke Oddessey</i>. Although he continues to bring both  styles to the table, <i>BlaQKout</i> finds the Dogg Pound member embracing his rap-for-rap's-sake lyrical experimentalism  wholeheartedly.  Kurupt seems so committed to the idea of saying  not that much in a very complicated way that it's utterly compelling.</p>
<p>Quik, on the other hand, is  consistently literal, dealing in the concrete with memorable, loosely connected  run-on raps. He's also a schizophrenic lyricist, unafraid of imagery  that seems out of place or contradictory to the overall mood, his charismatic  charm rescuing verses that should undermine him conceptually. His confessional,  endearing lyrics are like bar conversations with strangers where, after  a few drinks, you start offhandedly spilling personal anecdotes to each  other like old friends. At some basic level, Quik bonds easily with  his audience, letting his guard down, expressing himself with uninhibited  honesty.</p>
<p>As a producer, Quik understands  that making quality rap music isn't about banging out minor variations  of a signature style. <i>BlaQKout</i>'s narrative is one of surprise  and variation, of creating one set of expectations, then pulling the  rug out from underneath the audience one track later. One moment  he's dropping confrontational funk banger ""Fuck Y'all"", stable hip-hop  head comfort food. By the next track, he's sampling Moroccan music from  an episode of the Travel Channel's ""Bizarre Foods With Andrew Zimmern"",  melding it to cavernous drums and a summerjam-worthy chorus, all while  rapping about trapping you in your nightmares and how your poison is  his liquor. It is as if, after each song, Quik stepped back and entirely  reconsidered the whole project, upsetting any predictable motion or  boring moments by drawing from a bottomless bag of tricks.</p>
<p>As the record progresses, however,  there's more bravado to Quik's experimentalism. The closer  he comes to untethered adventurousness, the easier it is to develop  a nagging feeling that certain tracks are more interesting to talk about  than they are to actually listen to. Consider ""Exodus"", a dubbed-out  pseudo-Jamaican interlude/instrumental chant with no rapping, or ""Jupiter's  Critic &amp; the Mind of Mars"", an abrasive, bizarre track with grinding,  distorted electro-bass. Both tracks are ridiculous and self-indulgent, but creative and fun at the same time. Quik's focus on amusingly upsetting the status  quo is so well-considered, his spirit so fully committed to the idea  of making this work, that he pulls this shit off.</p>
<p>So what about Quik's worldview  gives <i>BlaQKout </i>such cohesion, unites vibes as disparate as ""Do  You Know""'s  shimmering gauziness and ""9x's Outta Ten""'s thunderous,  jagged exotica? After all these years, he's remained a great DJ.  The conceptual approach to this record, its sequencing and contrasts, suggests he not only values the music on a  song-for-song basis, but is aware the meta-narrative itself  is significant. He knows the context of our reception affects our appreciation,  and our willingness to let him push the envelope requires that we trust  him not to leave us stranded. Imagine how different the record would  have been if ""Jupiter's Critic"" was the lead single; ballsy, yes,  but also presumptuous. Instead, we're eased into Quik's exhilarating  world gradually. He earns our trust in order to take us wherever he wants to go, finally resolving with the satisfying  consonance of ""The Appeal"". But it's also about his eagerness to  entertain, to take risks in order to do something truly different. <i> BlaQKout</i> doesn't come from boring rapper royalty. It's by a DJ,  a modern court jester, his ideas shifting with raucous unpredictably,  a performer who doesn't just make music, but shapes the way we hear  it.</p></div>"|13211.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13211-blaqkout/|8.2|David Drake

But that transcendental urge is rarely so explicitly articulated as on Gavin Russom's self-titled album as Black Meteoric Star. The album is, in many ways, a direct extension of the smoldering freakouts of <i>Days of Mars</i>, a 2005 album Russom recorded with Delia Gonzalez. There, they harnessed a battery of vintage and home-built synthesizers to create their own version of classic ambient music-- liquid, evolving, nominally ""beatless,"" but imbued with unmistakable pulses cycling at different speeds. You could trace its sounds and ideas to electronic and compositional pioneers such as Brian Eno, Klaus Schulze, Steve Reich, Pete Namlook, and Carl Craig, but the obviousness of the lineage never stood in the way of the music's immediate, visceral qualities.</p>
<p>On <i>Black Meteoric Star</i>, Russom takes the duo's obsessive pursuits and applies them to the well-worn conventions of classic house and techno. Marked by simple, contrapuntal synthesizer arpeggios and jittery drum machine patterns, the music at first recalls the humid, shorted-wire minimalism of pioneering house and acid; it's not surprising to hear Russom namecheck Chicago's TRAX label and some of its artists in an interview with London's <i>FACT</i> magazine.</p>
<p>Sounds evocative of classic machines like the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer and TR-707 Rhythm Composer contribute to the vintage feel. Hallmarks of original house productions-- woodblocks, tambourines, hi-hats-- are now deeply rooted tropes, but Russom doesn't get tangled up in his piety. (The current vogue for intoning phrases like ""house music"" or ""Detroit"" over generically shoomping chords and congas is blissfully absent here.) He flirts with funk, but Black Meteoric Star isn't much interested in the humor or sensuality that animated Chicago's mid-80s house musicians. Instead of Robert Armani or Phuture's needling minimalism, he tends to a maximalist, sprawling psychedelia.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what Russom draws from his analog dance-music forebears has more to do with process than sound. Early house music derived much of its curious charge from the constraints its producers faced. Mothered by necessity, they made do with obsolete, bargain-basement instruments, often turning them on their ear and perverting their intended uses; they arranged in step time and recorded live, with none of the cut-and-paste convenience available in contemporary audio software. Russom likewise sticks to an all-analog setup combining vintage synthesizers and drum machines with more obscure boxes of his own invention; he records live in single takes. This necessitates a strict economy of means: the music is stripped down to only as many elements as can be reasonably manipulated in real time. His tracks batter a handful of ideas over and over again, with most of the variation a result of twisting filters and tweaking envelopes. But where TRAX emphasized the negative space that yawned in between the notes, Russom uses distortion and delay to smear his sounds into something corroded and verging on the limits of control. On ""World Eater"", there's at least one point where the beat audibly slips, most likely the result of his machines' wonky, loose-leashed timekeeping. (Synchronizing jerry-rigged circuitry like this, without the controlling hand of MIDI pushing things forward, is a notoriously dodgy affair.)</p>
<p>It's not as jarring as you'd think-- only a DJ in mid-mix would likely notice the slippage. But it's a reminder that Black Meteoric Star comes at ""dance music"" with an outsider's perspective. This stuff is worlds away from contemporary house and techno's relentless professionalism, perfect timekeeping, and pristine compression. The tracks are abuzz with line noise; the first four tracks bleed warm, tubelike distortion, while the final two sound like they were recorded live to a room mic, one possibly draped in milk-soaked cloth. That's part of the music's appeal, and also one of its ironies: At a time when the ""democratizing"" effect of music software has led to a glut of functional, professionally competent but imaginatively bankrupt music, the insistence upon a lo-fi aesthetic-- or better, ethic-- becomes something like a badge of honor, an auteur's protest.</p>
<p>Doth Russom protest too much? Maybe. The music doesn't always measure up to its conceptual ambitions. ""Death Tunnel"", one of the album's shortest tracks, barely merits its 378 seconds, and makes a self-defeating opener for the album. The rhythm plods, its eighth-note hi-hats cutting awkwardly into mushy arpeggios. And as intriguing as the basement-inventor backstory is, all that hand soldering sometimes makes you wish for more. In an interview with TheFader.com, Russom explains that he built his own machines because they allow him to do things that aren't possible with commercially available gear, but you wouldn't necessarily know it from the music itself. The drum patches are familiar from a thousand recordings; far more radical sounds have been conjured by synthesists with modular systems or even over-the-counter analog gear. And I'll admit to a slight resentment of the fact that the DFA imprimatur assures Russom the kind of press that any number of artists who have long worked in a similar idiom (Mark Verbos, Ra-X, Legowelt, Unit Moebius, Giorgio Gigli, Donato Dozzy, even Omar S, and many of them more skilled and engrossing than BMS) will never enjoy. But in Russom's defense, he's not trying to re-invent the wheel, just forge his own from the materials.</p>
<p>Something about <i>Black Meteoric Star</i> sucks you in, undeniably. A year ago, I was skeptical about the first four tracks I heard, longer versions of four included here; my doubts didn't abate when hearing the finished album. But after an initial near-dismissal, I found myself coming back to the record again and again, then searching for interviews with the artist to find out exactly what motivated these strange analog hailstorms, which worry away at their material with obsessive determination. All six tracks are suffused with high drama; there's something almost tectonic about them, the way rocky patterns are shoved aside by colliding plates of sound, overtones flying off like sparks in hot ash.</p>
<p>It's clenched, anxious music, but there's something profoundly relaxing about it. Depending upon your state of mind, it hunches in the background like a cushion of white noise, or, turned up loud, heaves the horizontal axis on high-- a vision of the dance floor as space elevator. It's no coincidence that the strongest tracks here are the longest ones (though the six-minute barrage of ""Dominatron"" is as forcefully evil as its title would suggest). The slack, toe-scuffingly funky ""World Eater"" and the grinding ""Anthem"" are both 10-minute samples of infinity. At 14 minutes long, ""Dreamcatcher"" dares to attempt more ambitious structures, juggling drum tracks and piling up counterpoints into a honeyed churn. And the andante ""Dawn"", sounding like the soundtrack for underwater breakdancing, turns 18 and a half minutes into a spaced-out blink of an eye.</p>
<p>That kind of expansive vision is nothing new in dance music, of course; if anything, it's becoming routine, in the wake of quarter-hour anthems from the likes of Ricardo Villalobos and Lindstrøm. But I get the sense that Russom's neverending sequences come from listening to the world around him: specifically, the days-long club culture of Berlin, where he lives now. These intense, sustained workouts are as spiritually inclined as the most gospel-infused ""spiritual house,"" just in different ways; they're reaching for the void that turns the dance floor inside out. (The irony is that you'd be hard-pressed to hear any of these tracks served up on Berlin's minimal smorgasbord, which recycles house music's watered-down tropes like a sushi restaurant serves up limp tuna on its endless conveyor belt.)</p>
<p>It's true that there's something a little bit precious about it all-- for instance, the fact that Russom once performed the project as part of a collaboration with the multi-media artists Assume Vivid Astro Focus that featured costumes, balloons, laser, and video projections. (In video clips of the performance, the balloons are a reminder of David Mancuso's Loft, while the projections and dancers more mundanely recall, well, just about any mainstream club from the Meatpacking District to Mitte.) But why shouldn't Russom at least try to do something special with his presentation-- especially when coming from the spectacle-shy world of indie rock? ""Projecting a 'fantasy environment' is important to me when I make dance music,"" Russom told <i>FACT</i>. ""It's something I do half-consciously, imagining the place where the music would fit ideally or what people would be wearing, etc. Like, 'What is the world that this belongs in?' It's quite sad that the dance floor is disappearing from the cultural landscape. It's a very important place."" Russom may come from a house outsider's background, but just like he and Gonzalez got ambient, I think he gets dance culture. <i>Black Meteoric Star</i> is a spiritual thing, a body thing; a cheeky thief and a generous giver. It's a long night out and a longer walk home, mind abuzz, ears ringing.</p></div>"|13231.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13231-black-meteoric-star/|6.8|Philip Sherburne

Several of the best dance music ""albums"" of the past few years-- like the Ricardo Villalobos and Omar S <i>Fabric</i> mixes, to name just two-- have managed to offer an hour-plus of (more-or-less) new music while also offering <i>motion</i>, an emotional/musical arc that justifies their running time. Especially with your more (there's no other word, sorry) minimal dance acts, the single-artist mix ideally prevents you from ever thinking, ""Have I just been listening to someone fiddle with their trackpad for the past five minutes?"" Or, ""Does this make me happy, or would I maybe be better off playing a Loverboy song?""</p>
<p>Ada's <i>Adaptations</i> collects 12 of the German producer's original tracks and remixes by and for other artists, strung into a mix that's neither as virtuosically deranged as Villalobos' or as functionally banging as Omar S'. Instead, it's one of the most inviting techno mixes/albums you'll hear this year, damn near cuddly. Don't mistake it for a pop record, though, or any sort of crossover stab, despite the preponderance of vocals and two indie-friendly covers. (Well, her remix of Brant's ""Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me"" comes off more of a titular nod in the direction of certain Mancunians, its melody drooping electro melancholia, rather than the sprightly Johnny Marr version of same.) But a mix/album that opens with the warm-blanket-on-a-cold-day purr of Everything But the Girl's Tracey Thorn, and includes a twinkly Michael Mayer/Tobias Thomas take on the looped longing Ada sieved from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' ""Maps""? That's pretty far from the forbidding cliché of the all-beats-and-nothing-but techno mix.</p>
<p>And when she goes purely (or almost) instrumental, Ada's taste still veers towards the laconic, blissful, and immediately appealing. The DJ Koze remix of ""Eve"", perhaps the one true 21st-century classic on the mix, may open with a scratched-in flurry of hip-hop and feature a repeating vocal sample that's a chipmunk-squeaky nod to old-school rave. But its twanging bassline and Jonzun Crew synth-chirrups are buffeted by billowing keyboards you'd mistake for shoegaze glaze if they were played by guitars in a more rock-centric context. Robin Guthrie would nod with grandfatherly approval at the fluffy, reverb-drenched sound of much of <i>Adaptations</i>, its pleasantly floaty and frou-frou vibe. Even Ada's nods to trad dance sounds, like the quasi-Spanish ""guitar"" that lazily twangs through her remix of Andi Teichmann's ""Tape"", are hazy in a manner more transmission-from-space than crisp, neo-Balearic banger.</p>
<p>It's maybe just a tad funny that, as a mix, <i>Adaptations</i> is just okay. On the evidence, Ada belongs to the long-slow-fade school of transitions, which suits her fuzzy sonics well enough. It just doesn't provide many jolts or surprises, easing you from track to track with a chain of bleeps or two overlapping melody lines. (On the other hand, turntablist trickery would just sound awkward applied to tracks that unfurl rather than bend or twist.) Still, though the oomph gently leaks out over the final quarter, there's enough bounce in her beats and b-lines to keep the record from evaporating into indistinct ambiance. <i>Adaptations</i> glides quite gracefully between floor-filler and recliner-friendly.</p></div>"|13143.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13143-adaptations-1-mixtape/|7.2|Jess Harvell

The beaded intersection wherein the former began cannibalizing the latter has always been particularly fertile for outsider art: peyote trips, sweat lodge bliss-outs, pastoral time travel, spirit animal petting zoos, and oh yeah, seeking out reservations both psychic and very real. So while copping so much more in pursuit of an aesthetic makes great ammo for eye-rolls, it doesn't take away from the fact that Pocahaunted have synthesized something here every bit as affected as it is affect<i>ing</i>.</p>
<p>Four tracks and just short of 40 minutes, <i>Passage</i> is passive listening defined. Hooks don't exist and melodic texture appears only if you're willing to wait on it. If that sounds like some fifth dimension, Magic Eye-type shit, it's because it is. Previous cassettes and vinyl releases contained detours through dub waters, but this, the Eagle Rock ""sisterhood""'s latest, feels like the most focused expression of the clouded atmospherics they've been attempting to live in on tape.</p>
<p>Drippy guitars lope, drone, and dance around Amanda Brown and Bethany Cosentino's creepy kiva moans, the mallet-on-drums percussion loose and insistent enough to strongly reinforce the ceremonial/ritual vibes this music lives and dies by. The oddly circular relationship between guitar and vocals here is actually a potential dealbreaker. <i>Passage</i>'s first half in particular catches the tail it chases, the twin crescendos of ""Palm"" and ""Salt"" locked-in and momentous enough to make it through the blankets of smoke and murk in which they germinate. Not the case with Act II. ""Dusk"" sits inert, neither the organ nor intermittent bursts of cymbal and dank guitar connect with Brown and Cosentino's vocal droning. The result, just as it is in the I-swear-I-just-saw-my-future-and-it-was-too-gnarly stoner vortex of ""Veil"", is claustrophobic to an upsetting degree, leaving the listener feeling more trapped than lost within its sound.</p></div>"|13191.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13191-passage/|6.1|David Bevan

And true to his reputation as a futurist, David Bowie tried to outdo them all with 1989's <i>Sound + Vision</i>, which supplemented the usual greatest-hits-plus-rarities format with a bonus disc of visual content that would showcase the glorious new CD-Video format. There was only one problem with his attempt to revolutionize the box set: no one knew what the hell a CD-Video disc was, let alone owned any kind of device that would allow one to view it.</p>
<p>It was around this same time that Neil Young started talking up an ambitious career-retrospective project called <i>Archives</i>, and given the amount of unreleased songs Young routinely dusted off in his concerts, fans had come to expect nothing less than a parallel-universe repertoire every bit as rich and deep as his official one-- a <i>Decade</i> to last for decades. But as gleaned by anyone who's gone to a Neil Young show expecting to hear the hits but treated to an hour of <i>Greendale</i> instead, being a Neil fan requires a certain amount of patience. Twenty years since its first public mention, <i>Archives</i> has gone on to usurp even <i>Chinese Democracy</i> as the ultimate lost-album punchline. But the long-delayed arrival of this first volume seems less a matter of archeology as technology. And like the Bowie box, there's some confusion about how exactly you're supposed to use the thing.</p>
<p>Neil Young is an odd sort of perfectionist, favoring a raw immediacy in his recordings that often means leaving the mistakes in for purity's sake, but he's obsessed with making sure those mistakes are mixed and mastered to sometimes unattainable standards of fidelity. (He refused to release arguably his finest album, 1974's <i>On the Beach</i>, on CD until 2003 for this reason.) So it appears that the advent of Blu-ray HD audio technology was the missing piece that has allowed Neil to realize his multimedia masterplan for <i>Archives</i>. What little public comment he's made about <i>Archives</i>' release has taken the form of evangelical praise for the medium, urging fans to adopt the new technology like a Best Buy salesman working on commission.</p>
<p>The first volume of <i>Archives</i> arrives as a 10-disc set, spanning the first 10 years of Young's career and, somewhat confusingly, three different formats. For the most ardent audiophiles, there's the $300 multimedia-enhanced Blu-ray edition that includes six compilation discs; the previously released <i>Live at the Fillmore East</i> and <i>Live at Massey Hall</i>; an additional solo concert recorded in 1969 at the Riverboat coffeehouse in Toronto (though it boasts a tracklist similar to last year's <i>Live at Canterbury House</i> set, also included here as an unlisted bonus throw-in); the first DVD release of Young's infamous tour-documentary-cum-existential-road-flick, <i>Journey Through the Past</i>; plus online-update capabilities through which users will have access to more material.</p>
<p>For equally fervent fans (and Pitchfork reviewers) with inferior home-entertainment set-ups, there's a $200 version boasting all of the above musical and multimedia content in a DVD format. And for those who just want some Neil on-hand in the car to soundtrack future road trips forevermore, there's a basic eight-disc $100 CD box with all the tunes but none of the extras. (All versions come with mp3 download codes, though we all know how Neil feels about iPods.)</p>
<p>Regardless of the format, each version of <i>Archives</i> makes the same convincing case: For Neil Young, the years of 1963 to 1972 were marked by a rapid maturation and a series of successful stylistic reinventions that rivaled the Beatles. Starting out as the surf-rockin' frontman for Winnipeg garage combo the Squires, he quickly transitioned into the folkie busker cutting early demos of ""Sugar Mountain"" for Elektra Records in 1965; the wide-screened psychedelic visionary in Buffalo Springfield; the savage electric warrior of 1969's Crazy Horse debut, <i>Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</i>; the heroic hippie wingman for Crosby, Stills and Nash; and then the country-rock traditionalist of 1970's <i>After the Gold Rush</i> and 1972's <i>Harvest</i>. On top of summarizing a tidy 10-year span, <i>Archives Vol. 1</i> ends symbolically with Neil at his commercial peak, before a growing disillusionment with rock stardom and the death of close friends would usher in a more darkly compelling phase of his career.</p>
<p>But while they're paying the least amount of money, the CD-box purchasers may feel the most short-changed, as <i>Archives</i> is not quite the vault-clearing revelation that fans may have been hoping for. Of the advertised 43 unreleased tracks, most take the form of alternate mixes or live versions of familiar material, ranging from the subtle (a cavernous mix of ""Helpless"" that enhances the song's hymnal qualities) to the substantial (early stripped-down versions of ""Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere"" and future <i>On the Beach</i> track ""See the Sky About to Rain""). But as <i>Archives</i> attests, the lack of true, unheard rarities can be explained by the fact that Neil's been pulling from his mythical stash of lost songs since the mid-60s, padding his 70s and 80s releases with songs (""Winterlong"", ""Come on Baby Let's Go Downtown"", ""Wonderin'"") written during this early era.</p>
<p>So in a purely musical sense, <i>Archives</i>' real selling point isn't so much the tracklist as the remastering. And make no doubt about it: Next to the budget-line CD issues that Reprise rushed to the market in the late 80s, the new versions sound spectacular, breathing new life into these old warhorses. (The swirling symphonics of <i>Harvest</i>'s ""A Man Needs a Maid"", in particular, beg for a big pair of headphones and an easy chair.) However, one can't help but question why these remasters can only be accessed via an expensive box set rather than through individual album reissues. With so many songs here already familiar to even the most casual classic-rock radio listener, the most illuminating moments on <i>Archives</i> come from the less celebrated tracts of his career. For one, the Squires tracks provide not just a time-capsule snapshot of Neil's first recording forays; rather, songs like the wonderful ""I'll Love You Forever"" provide glimpses of an unrealized future as a Beatlesque balladeer. (Alternately, the twangy instrumental ""Mustangs"" could pass for vintage Meat Puppets.) And if the turn-of-the-70s triumvirate of <i>Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere</i>, <i>After the Gold Rush</i>, and <i>Harvest</i> became the go-to soundtracks for America's post-hippie hangover, Neil's comparatively overlooked 1969 self-titled debut feels all the more contemporary for being excluded from that classic-rock holy trinity, boasting a soft-rock lushness that-- in light of psychedelic successors like the Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, and Sparklehorse-- has proven as influential as any album in his canon.</p>
<p>But as <i>Archives</i>' multitude of newspaper clippings and radio interview excerpts explain, it was Neil's dissatisfaction with that first album's textured production and mastering that made him go folk/rock (not to be confused with folk-rock), and though they're already been released, the Massey Hall and Fillmore sets still represent this era's purest manifestations of those acoustic/electric extremes. The 1969 Riverboat disc, however, is less about what Neil does during the songs (acoustic readings of his first-album and Springfield catalogues) as between them: he talks. A lot. So much so that the these between-song ""raps"" constitute their own bonus feature on the Riverboat disc-- perhaps inspired by one-time tour-mate Thurston Moore's similar verbal deconstruction of a Venom live album-- with a stream of amusing anecdotes about groupies, drugs and the Guess Who. In the same sense, <i>Archives</i> is ultimately less interesting when seen as a compilation of music than as a digital storehouse of a man's complete life and work.</p>
<p>Taken individually, the reams of extras that accompany every track on the DVD/Blu-ray editions-- candid photos, original handwritten lyric sheets, radio-promo spots, newspaper clippings, tape-box doodles, and so on-- may not seem like a compelling reason to pony up for <i>Archives</i>' enhanced options. But cumulatively, they chart an evolution as intriguing as that heard in the songs. Given that Neil's become rather media-shy in his old age, <i>Archives</i> provides an opportunity to track his transformation as a public figure through the many newspaper articles and radio-interview clips gathered here, from the wide-eyed teenager promoting his club night in the Winnipeg daily to the disgruntled Buffalo Springfield exile trashing Jimmy Messina's mixing job on that band's last record (early evidence of Neil's notorious audiophilia) to the self-described ""rich hippie"" contemplating the peculiarities of fame just as <i>Harvest</i> is about to make him a superstar.</p>
<p>And the (mostly hidden) video teases sprinkled throughout the set-- like CSNY performing ""Down By the River"" on a David Steinberg-hosted teen dance show, or rare glimpses of the long-gone <i>Riverboat</i>-- culminate with a treasure trove of footage on <i>Archives</i>' final disc. Here we get a series of intimate interviews conducted during <i>Harvest</i>'s farmhouse recording sessions, as well as <i>Archives</i>' most amusing easter egg find: a 15-minute sequence where Neil discovers CSNY bootlegs during a record-shopping trip circa 1971, sparking a heated argument with the store employee that culminates in Neil walking out of the shop, bootlegs in hand, without paying for them. (The sequence is especially resonant in light of Neil's recent endorsement of Warner Music Group pulling all their artists' videos off YouTube.)</p>
<p>Taken together, <i>Archives</i>' musical and visual material form as complete a picture of Neil Young's early years as the most die-hard fan could hope for. But therein lies the fundamental flaw of <i>Archives </i>on DVD-- you can't take them together. Each track is housed in a virtual file folder that allows you to play the audio track <i>or</i> scour the bonus content; there is no way to do them simultaneously. So your options are either to let the music play uninterrupted (while your screen displays serene film loops of spinning record players and reel-to-reel machines), or exit ""play"" mode and silently sift through the extras-- without being able to actually listen to the song those extras are meant to contextualize. It's like being told that your computer can run iTunes, or your web browser, but you have to shut down one to use the other. It means you end up spending as much time fiddling with your DVD menu controls as enjoying the material you're trying to access. You have to spring for the Blu-ray to access different pieces of media simultaneously.</p>
<p>Brian Eno was recently quoted as saying that if the practice of selling music in physical form is to continue, the emphasis will have to shift from the content to the form, to enable a unique user experience that can't be replicated with the click of a mouse. <i>Archives</i> constitutes a bold step towards this new paradigm, where the delivery system is as much in service to the supplemental materials as the music that ephemera serves to canonize. And for all its multimedia chicanery, <i>Archives</i> ultimately seeks to reassert an old-fashioned mode of attentive listening and engagement that's been mostly lost as music becomes a WiFi-streamed soundtrack to some other activity. But if Neil expects his fans to retain their enthusiasm for future volumes (particularly when the focus shifts to his erratic 80s output), he'll need to make that immersion process more fluid, less disruptive. Certainly <i>Archives</i>' first volume contains enough audio and visual stimuli to keep a Neil Young fan busy till the next edition arrives (presumably) in 2029. But that's as much a comment on the impractical, time-consuming interface as the content itself.</p></div>"|13164.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13164-the-archives-vol-1-1963-1972/|7.0|Stuart Berman

Dance music always mutates, usually in predictable ways, when repackaged for CD, thanks to all the familiar sonic limitations of home playback devices. (No earbuds will ever work as proper bass bins when they're not even designed with the same net effect in mind.) The dance fan makes peace that she's buying a compromised product, or at least something she has to learn to hear and enjoy minus the thick, 3-D depth of a really sweet club sound system. This cruel squishing of nuance is old news to anyone who owns more than one single-artist singles collection purchased from the electronic section.</p>
<p>And <i>The Roots of El-B</i> could potentially suffer more than most, because this is gloriously thick, 3-D, nuanced dance music. El-B is one of several pseudonyms adopted by UK producer Lewis Beadle in the late 1990s/early 00s, the moment when serious-minded dubstep first threatened to secede from London's happy-go-lucky garage culture. For a time, El-B was a master of taking UK garage's bright and peppy grooves and perverting them with slow, mean, overwhelming basslines. It was a low-end sound that was mechanically alienating, like wobbling bursts of between-stations radio fuzz squeezed and molded until fat and spherical. But El-B also loved a free-flowing, almost formless sensation of pure weight, holding a flame to the coiling b-lines of Jamaican dub until the shape melted away.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, pace my opening graf, you're going to get only a pale approximation of this totalizing oomph, of how these basslines could feel like concrete slowly setting in the spaces between dancers. Thankfully El-B also produced what so many of his dubstep-identified followers did (or could) not: gloriously intricate rhythms, their brittle timbre just about perfect for the thin top-end that's usually the bane of the bargain stereo. Each tune is built on a dizzying drum track, uniform in their post-jungle approach to fractured but tightly arranged rhythm, but never same-y sounding like the dullest two-step drum'n'bass. A jerking or clonking kick drum reminds you this is body music, while El-B swings severely syncopated hi-hats and snares that verge on disorienting if followed too closely. He then maps out every remaining millisecond-sized nook and cranny between the tautly stitched beats, and somehow finds room for horns (""Express""), vocal samples (""Lyrical Tempo""), and a myriad of little percussion flourishes (just about every track). El-B's genius is in, say, the way he keeps throwing maddening did-I-actually-just-hear-that? offbeats and rhythmic feints into the mesh of jazzy brass stabs and garage drums on ""Among the Stars"", while keeping things orderly enough to suit dancers who don't have the luxury of hitting rewind to pick apart his grooves for a second or third time.</p>
<p>The tidiness of his micro-edited rhythms means some of the tracks could sound repetitive, rather than hypnotic, on first listen. Crank a seemingly static track like ""Digital"", however, and all of a sudden you notice how elastically the bassline stretches around and between the implacable snare cracks. The slithers of cymbal and spasms of snare that add little spikes of energy to a groove that might otherwise drag. The patiently layered horror movie synth drones, blowing over the groove like cold winds. While <i>The Roots of El-B</i> isn't all ""dark swing,"" to use a phrase bandied around the scene for a minute before ""dubstep"" finally stuck, it <i>is</i> helpful to remember that Beadle was one of the key producers in (for better or worse) moving UK garage away from the sugary, full-vocal pop remixes of its crossover heyday. Like many dance music full-lengths, <i>The Roots of El-B</i> demands devotion to pure rhythm, a willingness to trade songs for the percussive arrangement of pure sound, rewarding your fealty to syncopation more richly than most.</p></div>"|13095.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13095-the-roots-of-el-b/|7.0|Jess Harvell

Radio is a wave. Radio playing music is a wave carrying another wave to your receiver. You have to love physics for exposing us to things like this that we can't see. Knowing what a sound wave and a radio wave are makes it all the more amazing how significant the emotional effects of properly organized sound waves can be. Light waves are completely different, but they combine quite nicely with sound waves at a live show to give a band an idea of how its audience is responding and an audience something to respond to. So the radio session is a bit of an oddity among live recordings, because it almost always removes light from the equation-- there's an audience out there, but how big is it? Who is in it? What are they thinking?</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Because of this, bands are essentially free to indulge themselves, which is one of the reasons radio sessions have proven such a great source of bootlegs over the years (good sound quality is another). On <i>Over Air</i>, Gregor Samsa have saved bootleggers the trouble by presenting a studio performance for Dutch radio station VPRO. The band's hushed, glacial sound is the kind of thing that works best when all else is quiet, so this is probably the most sensible way for them to get a live record out there. There's precious little to hold onto in this music-- Champ Bennett's slow-moving songs coalesce from the most minimal of elements, like water droplets forming from mist on a windshield. It certainly offers little of the existential terror implied by their Kafka-referencing name.</p>
<p>Even after listening to this album 13 times, I can hardly remember any of it-- and I knew most of these songs beforehand!-- but I don't think that's really the point anyway. This is music of the moment, meant for you to live inside of while it's there and evaporate. Little bits like the ""seems the devil's got a grip on me"" chorus from ""Jeroen Van Aken"" offer melody to hook you a bit, but even that is delivered in such a quiet, retiring way by the shy boy-girl harmonies of Champ and Nikki Bennett (who used to be Nikki King) that it's as if they're afraid to impose the song on you. It is exceedingly pretty though, as is pretty much the entire disc. The keyboard washes, sprinkling of piano, smeared clarinet and violin, and guitars that don't sound like guitars all add up to a very pleasant listening experience. The one moment of truly momentous drama comes on ""Young And Old"", originally from their <i>55:12</i> album, when the track explodes for a few moments into a fountain of overdriven guitar.</p>
<p>Most of the other songs are drawn from 2008's <i>Rest</i> LP, including ""Abutting, Dismantling"", with its shifting texture and gradual build to a steady, pounding mid-section. There are a few non-VPRO tracks as well: an alternate mix of ""Du Meine Leise"" and a couple of very sleepy ambient instrumentals that don't diminish from the package but also add little. If you'd like to see the band doing its thing, the disc also includes a generous 30-minute video of them performing in Paris that actually finds them a bit more lively than the VPRO performance-- ""Rock Song"" is particularly inspired. Maybe there's something to those light waves after all. This bit of added value makes this a very worthy addition to  a Gregor Samsa fan's collection, but it's likely that if you weren't already interested, this won't change your mind.</p></div>"|13166.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13166-over-air/|6.0|Joe Tangari

Yet Norway's I Was a King offer a welcome twist on the same ol'. Sure, all the usual signifiers are swimming through the group's self-titled second album, as well as elements borrowed from pioneering 60s synthesists Big Star or the Raspberries (the group covers a song from 60s survivor Larry Norman, too). But I Was a King also go well beyond that span, right up through the 1990s heyday of shoegaze and its own sideways 60s synthesists, from Teenage Fanclub to My Bloody Valentine.</p>
<p>Imagine Matthew Sweet's ""Girlfriend"", only with Kevin Shields and J Mascis subbed in for Robert Quine and Richard Lloyd, and you get an idea of I Was a King's cumulative, generation-spanning appeal, at least theoretically. But as good as that may read, the sounds here are mostly enlisted in service of largely predictable and not quite fully formed power-pop. It doesn't help that Frode Strømstad isn't much of a singer, but in his defense, his thin vocals are secondary to the craft. To that end Strømstad's roped in some impressive ringers: Sufjan Stevens, Serena Maneesh's Emil Nikolaisen, Danielson's Daniel Smith, the Ladybug Transistor's Gary Olson, all of whom produce or play throughout the disc. Just what they all contribute, specifically, isn't revealed by the sleeve notes, nor is their influence readily apparent (barring Nikolaisen's love of fuzz). But neither does Strømstad sound like some puppet, instead confidently directing songs such as ""Breathe"" and ""Step Aside"" through their fleeting but hooky paths.</p>
<p>The record's relative facelessness is lifted, however, when Strømstad knocks out one of the album's handful of highlights. Piano-padding aside, ""It's All You"" is melancholy power-pop at its finest, matched by the mellow Dino Jr. roar of ""Not Like This"" and ""Weighing Anchor"". Best of all is ""Norman Bleik"" (as if all the subtle Teenage Fanclub nods weren't obvious enough) the perfect balance of jangle and fuzz that handily wraps up all the group's strong points into one tidy package.</p>
<p>Curiously, all these songs come at the tail end of the album,  and, coincidentally or not, most hone closer to the three-minute mark or beyond, too, an arguable sign that Strømstad knew a good thing when he wrote it and fleshed it out. Conversely, these peaks lessen the impact of the rest of the disc, revealing the flaws of even long-tested rock formulas. Hooks are one thing, but songs are another, and the former can only rarely carry the latter. I Was a King aren't quite at that point, but the band's definitely worth watching.</p></div>"|13229.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13229-i-was-a-king/|6.4|Joshua Klein

First and foremost: the ""they are pretty good for their age!"" factor, which can override critical faculties and make us forgive the sort of artistic decisions we'd normally find boring or annoying in the work of adults. If the young musicians are clearly influenced by things we deem cool, there is a high risk of approving their work simply for affirming our tastes. Most obviously, no one wants to be the creep who begrudges the youthful enthusiasm of people who are clearly having a good time doing cool stuff at a very early age. Nevertheless, if we're being very honest, the music made by children and young teenagers is almost always awful, and the Tiny Masters of Today, despite being signed to an EMI label, are not an exception to the rule.</p>
<p>The Tiny Masters are Ada (13) and Ivan (15), siblings from Brooklyn who have been writing and performing together since their early tweens. They are always joined by an older musician on drums-- in the old days, it was Russell Simins from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, but on <i>Skeletons</i>, they are joined by Jackson Pollis, an 18-year-old who is also a member of model Agyness Deyn's band. The fact that these kids apparently require a chaperon is somewhat troubling, but it's probably for the best, as the percussion on the record is solid enough to prop up their understandably limited musical skills. That said, the level of musicianship on the record is adequate, and at least on the same level as countless mediocre punk and indie bands.</p>
<p>That's the root of the problem with the Tiny Masters of Today, though. They are impressive only in comparison to a) other kids their age who have not somehow been encouraged to become a full-time touring band by hipster stage parents, and b) their least-inspired adult contemporaries. At their best, the Tiny Masters provide self-conscious kiddy variations on vaguely arty strains of punk and alt-rock, but there is very little practical use for this music besides causing adults to go, ""awww, cute!"" The lyrics are predictably banal and laughable, the vocals are uniformly flat and insecure. The melodies are not bad, but they are simplistic and mostly have the irritating cadences of playground chants and jingles. (Truly, much of the album sounds like a series of homemade Mountain Dew ads.)</p>
<p>Though they are kids being kids, there is something very off-putting about how much the Tiny Masters buy into established notions of what punky music made by young teens ought to be like. Many of us were at our most emotional and melodramatic at 13 and 15, but Ivan and Ada seem intent on projecting an image of good-natured brattiness that comes across as false and hollowly nostalgic as a ""Dennis the Menace"" comic strip. There is an alarming lack of imagination in evidence on <i>Skeletons</i>, and virtually nothing in the way of strong emotion. Every song is charmlessly cutesy, and the most passionate moment on the record comes when Ada slams her square peers on ""Abercrombie Zombie"". This work may be ""pretty good for their age,"" but that's about it. It does not matter how old the authors may be-- this is very shallow, unengaging music, and it is hard to imagine anyone truly caring about any of these songs.</p></div>"|13096.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13096-skeletons/|3.0|Matthew Perpetua

In 1992, Ardent/Fantasy released the first two Big Star records-- <i>#1 Record</i> (1972) and <i>Radio City</i> (1974)-- on one CD, which at the time seemed like a generous rescue project for two influential cult albums that were out of print in every format. Included were liner notes by pop historian Brian Hogg and journalist Rick Clark, along with a couple of fuzzy black-and-white photos of the band and a tear-off mail-in survey. For a Big Star newcomer with limited cash but a voracious musical appetite, it was a dream-- not simply more bang for your buck, but an instantly immersive introduction to the band.</p>
<p>However, the decision to re-release this ""2 Complete Original Albums on 1 CD"" set is questionable, not least because it is a slavish reprinting of the original. There's no mail-in survey this time around, but the reissue preserves the crowded layout of the original, except the digital printing is just above Xerox quality and the images even fuzzier than before. Just how little effort went into this re-release? The running time for both albums is still listed in the little red box as 73:00, despite the addition of two bonus single mixes that push running time closer to 80:00.</p>
<p>If this double release once benefited the first-time buyer, it ill serves the music itself, compacting two very different albums into one long, awkward retrospective. <i>#1 Record</i> showcases the collaborative songwriting of Chris Bell and Alex Chilton, who fashioned themselves as Memphis' own Lennon-McCartney. They alternate vocals between Bell's sandpapery rasp and Chilton's smooth falsetto (which doesn't even sound like it emanates from the same throat as those Box Tops vocals), and the result is one of power-pop's defining records. ""The Ballad of El Goodo"" takes as its refrain a line from an old spiritual-- ""There ain't no one going to turn me 'round""-- which had become locally prominent as a civil rights slogan. The Big Star song is both tough and tender, communal and individual-- and genuinely moving without knowledge of its origins. #<i>1 Record</i> is shot through with an adolescent romanticism that kicks off in the restless energy of ""In the Street"", with its infectious guitar lick and rebel poetry lyrics and culminates on the Chilton-sung ""Thirteen"", an aching acoustic evocation of teenage angst.</p>
<p>Despite the reported hostility between them, Bell and Chilton are both strong presences on <i>#1 Record</i>, but their partnership was short-lived. Bell left the band shortly after the album's release and commercial failure, which made Big Star essentially a solo project for Chilton. So <i>Radio City</i> is a very different record. The transition between <i>#1 Record</i> closer ""ST 100/6"" and <i>Radio City</i> opener ""O My Soul"" was always jarring, but it's made worse by the addition of the single mix of ""In the Street"", which was originally the B-side to ""When My Baby's Beside Me"". Like the shortened mix of ""O My Soul"" that ends the new set, it's more interesting historically than musically.</p>
<p>On <i>Radio City</i>, Chilton, bass player Andy Hummel, and drummer Jody Stephens emphasize rhythm as much as melody, especially with the snaky guitars of opener ""O My Soul"", which hint at the singer's later fascination with old R&amp;B sounds. It's still a pop record, and ""She's a Mover"" and ""Mod Lang"" might be their most Anglophilic moments ever. And then there's ""Back of a Car"", ""You Get What You Deserve"", and ""September Gurls""-- one perfect pop gem after another that blur the line between album and singles band. In fact, <i>Radio City</i> is simultaneously a grab for airplay and sales and the beginning of Chilton's musical entrenchment that would continue through <i>Third/Sisters Lovers</i> (a Big Star album in name only) and into his solo career. More than that, it is the adult counterpart to its adolescent predecessor, forgoing the debut's single-minded intensity for a more nuanced mix of emotions ranging from jaded (""You Get What You Deserve"") to resigned (""Back of a Car"") to sentimental (""I'm in Love with a Girl"").</p>
<p>For many listeners-- including, for a few years, me-- Big Star were more legend than band. They were the beloved patron saints for struggling musicians: These albums were inspired and inspiring but never found a wide audience, yet the fact that they eventually became so revered offered encouragement to young songwriters with their own dream of big stardom and No. 1 records. Even if you never found an audience in your prime, you could always hope for later cult success. And to some extent, of course, the myth overtook the music, which means these two albums tend to be slightly overrated. <i>#1 Record</i> begins to lag on side two, and Hummel's ""The India Song"" remains imminently skippable (I once tried to convince myself that it was a parody of Beatles mysticism, but that's wishful thinking). Similarly, the complexity of <i>Radio City</i> often masks an elusiveness that dogs Chilton even today. Even so, I would argue that such flaws make these albums all the more fascinating and endearing: ""ST 100/6"" is surely someone's favorite Big Star song, and Chilton's evasiveness made him a cult figure apart from Big Star.</p>
<p>That only makes the redundancy of this set all the more egregious: there's no sense of engaging with these records anew, no attempt to determine what they might mean now as opposed to what they meant 16 years ago. It may still be a useful introduction to Big Star, but it still stings as a major mishandling of a cult-canonical catalog, especially when Stax/Concord is releasing such handsome and informative reissues of Isaac Hayes' contemporaneous albums. On the other hand, the label is also issuing both Big Star albums individually on vinyl, which seems intended for those one-time newcomers who've grown to cherish both <i>#1 Record</i> and <i>Radio City</i> as totems of lost youth but who will view this shabby set as merely a relic of the CD Age.</p></div>"|13101.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13101-1-record-radio-city/|4.5|Stephen M.

But even if ""nice sounds"" is something of a dirty phrase in the indie lexicon, there is, of course, a place for pleasant music when it's done right. Enter Underwater Peoples, a Washington, D.C.-based boutique imprint that joins similarly minded labels Acephale (Memory Cassette, Air France) and Sincerely Yours (the Tough Alliance, um, Air France)-- plus marquee artists Fleet Foxes and Vampire Weekend-- by offering quality indie music that also happens to <i>sound</i> really good. Home to blog-friendly bands Real Estate and Ducktails, the label has seen an uptick in interest over the past few months for its development of a lo-fi, beachy aesthetic via the signing of a dozen or so groups scattered across the country all trafficking in and around this general style. This nicely varied and well-sequenced compilation-- originally offered as a free download through sites friendly with Underwater Peoples-- rounds up tracks by most of those artists for a collection that might as well be called <i>Endless Summer</i>.</p>
<p>This is music that seems to have been developed specifically for flip-flopped backyard barbecues, sun-baked roadtrips, and beachfront campfires (song titles ""Banana Jam Pt. 1"", ""Backyard"", and ""Beach Comber"" tell you as much right off the bat). Just take a look at that album cover-- the hazy, soft-focus lighting, a rubber ducky, some guy straight relaxing in a suburban <i>Playboy</i>-style grotto. That dude is <i>chilling</i>. And that's kind of the point here: establishing a seasonal mood, a supine vibe that exists throughout the entire record. Perhaps more importantly, the compilation also helps to define Underwater Peoples' signature style, a sort of a crusty amalgam of the current strain of CSNY-leaning underground Americana, classic mid-nineties guitar indie, and the more experimental tropical collage-pop of Panda Bear and El Guincho, to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>But even for the kinda-sorta adventurous moments here-- occasional bits of sampling and vocal looping, for instance-- the clear priorities are simplicity and tunefulness, and the best songs feature both in spades. Despite its cringe-worthy title, Frat Dad's ""Brosef"" is accomplished indie rock that nicely balances the mournful longing of its group-sung chorus with filthier, ramshackle verses. Sexier and more rhythmic than just about anything that can be slapped with a ""white-guy indie"" tag nowadays, Family Portrait's excellent ""Mega Secrets"" is even more successful, and it's got just enough of a scuzz coating to keep it from parting ways with the rest of the lo-fi-ish stuff around it. And New Jersey-based songwriter Liam the Younger provides further highlights with a pair of acoustic numbers that also represent the album's most outwardly folk moments. On ""Country Wide"", his quavering vocals emphasize a somber-but-hopeful quality that gives the track emotional depth beyond its simple Appalachian strumming.</p>
<p>The remainder of the <i>Underwater Peoples</i> compilation is divided between several subgenres that each fall somewhere under the larger umbrella of this brand of homespun summertime pop. Slower, dirge-y instrumentals by Ducktails, more classically surf-inspired Animal Collective-leaning tunes from Pill Wonder, and Sad City's breezy patchwork pop all fare well here. (Almost surprisingly, for a group of mostly unknown artists on a label probably too small to distribute its own CDs, there are only a few songs here that don't fit or feel superfluous.) All of these tracks rely more on a vibe than heady creative concepts, but they nail that vibe. They're all unapologetically pleasant. And that might end up being the album's biggest selling point and its Achilles heel-- it won't expand your musical horizons and might not end up on your year-end list, but you'll listen to it a lot and enjoy it... a lot. And, hey, there's nothing wrong with that.</p></div>"|13147.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13147-underwaterpeoples-records-showcase/|7.6|Joe Colly

If these projects sound too different, people might think you have a problem with the group. Sound too similar, and people might think, well, what's the point? Fortunately Rhett Miller, frontman for the Old 97's and solo artist, has managed to strike a fine balance between the two, slightly favoring Texas country with the former and more sophisticated L.A. pop with the latter. Indeed, L.A. pop savant Jon Brion produced and played on Miller's (relative) solo breakthrough, <i>The Instigator</i>, contributed to its follow-up, <i>The Believer</i>, and pops up all over Miller's self-titled fourth disc, even if the much of the disc was crafted in Dallas.</p>
<p>Clocking in at a hair under 40 minutes, <i>Rhett Miller</i> falls toward the mellower end of the power-pop spectrum, which is to say it's impeccably crafted and heavy on tasteful tunesmithery. How much you'll enjoy this leans on one's interest in forlorn romanticism (""Haphazardly""), British Invasion nods (""Nobody Says I Love You Anymore""), and good ol' jangle-pop (the Marshall Crenshaw-rific ""If It's Not Love"" and ""I Need to Know Where I Stand""). No surprises there, but Miller does shake things up now and again: On ""Happy Birthday Don't Die"", he unleashes his inner Robyn Hitchcock, paying homage to his fellow Largo buddy with a weird, rollicking sci-fi glimpse into the future. On ""Bonfire"", he paints a more restrained, lullaby-like portrait rife with enigmatic portent. That he sounds equally comfortable at both extremes is a testament to his restraint-- even at its most ornate, the album thankfully keeps the distracting bells and whistles to a minimum, in turn keeping the focus on the songs.</p>
<p>Speaking of songs, Miller's claimed that much of the album was informed by the death of his grandmother as well as the suicide of David Foster Wallace (whom he considered a hero), but any shadow hanging over the disc is subtle at best, especially since Miller can't resist pairing bittersweet lyrics with peppier tunes, as he does in ""Like Love"" and ""Caroline"". On the other hand, the sweet ""Sometimes"", rather than drawing from some dark corner of Miller's subconscious world, was apparently inspired by a melody hummed by his two-year old daughter in her crib, and fittingly it's a song more likely to inspire ""aww""s than awe. Like much of <i>Rhett Miller</i>, and unlike much oft-unctuous power pop, it's music seemingly made to softly impress rather than outright inspire.

Theirs was a reputation built not on being the loudest band all the time, but rather at just the right time. It's a lesson that San Francisco-via-Santa Cruz sextet Sleepy Sun have taken to heart-- their debut album, <i>Embrace</i>, dispenses its earth-quaking riffage in such carefully measured, perfectly spaced-out rations, it tricks you into thinking the band is much heavier than it actually is.</p>
<p>Their long hair, nature-kid press photos and onstage face paint seemingly align Sleepy Sun with San Fran's tie-dyed tradition, but the band's palette is actually smeared with a whole lotta Blacks: Sabbath, Mountain (whose producer, Colin Stewart, works the boards here), Angels and-- when singer Bret Constantino busts out a boogie-summoning wail on ""Snow Goddess""-- even the Crowes. But if the opening ""New Age"" establishes Sleepy Sun as archetypal stoner-rockers-- with Constantino's vaporous vocals floating atop a subterranean fuzz bassline, molten guitar leads, and drum fills that roll right off of Bill Ward's tom-tom rack-- the song's follow-up, the surprisingly affecting piano-based spiritual ""Lord"", shows the group has designs on writing songs that still move you after the drugs wear off, and that Constantino can be the sort of emotionally assertive vocalist who doesn't always have to hide behind the haze.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Embrace</i> plays up that oppositional tension-- namely, the question of whether Sleepy Sun will follow unruly acid-rock trailblazers like Comets on Fire down the volcano (as suggested by the sudden fuzz-punk eruption of ""Red/Black""), or clean up their act and join fellow reverb junkies My Morning Jacket in the <i>Dark Was the Night</i>-tier indie ivory tower (see: the paisley-hued pastorale ""Golden Artifact"", wherein the band's former standing as a Fleet Foxes opening act makes most sense). To their credit, Sleepy Sun never let on as to which way they're going to lean, and seemingly build their centerpiece track ""White Dove"" as a monument to their own contradictory mystique. Clocking in at over nine minutes, it's the song that all the others here are in service to, capturing the band at their most sludgy and sinister before eventually fading into a blissed-out psych-folk denouement. And in the middle of it all: a drum solo. But then that's just the sort of 1970s-reverent gesture you'd expect from a group of hippies who, as of last year, were generously giving this album away for free over the Internet, but probably agreed to issue it on a proper label just so they could hear it on vinyl.</p></div>"|13098.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13098-embrace/|7.5|Stuart Berman

Because in a really creative poem, you never know what's coming next. So like, a film by Orson Welles contains more information than other films of its day, because nobody else would shoot their scenes in exactly the same way. Sad to say, Client are not their generation's chilly UK electro-pop version of Orson Welles.</p>
<p>In fact, Client have basically defined themselves by withholding information-- from their anti-image image to their repetive, generic, but nonetheless well-constructed and hooky music. Core duo Kate Holmes and Sarah Blackwood originally took on the code names Client A and Client B because they didn't want to be known as, respectively, the wife of former Creation Records chief Alan McGee and the former singer for 1990s British act Dubstar. That's understandable. On fourth album <i>Command</i>, Client race toward goth night at your local disco, with Killing Joke's Youth (fresh off a collaboration with Sir Paul McCartney) and the Sneaker Pimps' Joe Wilson splitting production duties. Look at the cover art, though: The uniform has changed, but Client are still proudly faceless.</p>
<p>That's understandable, too-- not for nothing did Client cover Adam and the Ants' cynical post-punk side ""Zerox"" on 2007's slightly more rocking <i>Heartland</i>-- but their lack of a discrete identity also makes for pretty forgettable albums. Vague lyrics continue to be a sticking point, and it doesn't help that they repeat what few lyrics they have over and over again. Why, the screeching ""Satisfaction"" and faster, more dancefloor-ready ""Blackheart"" even use their first verses twice. That the lyrics consist of phrases like ""junkie love, junkie love"", on opener ""Your Love Is Like Petrol"", or ""fucked-up music sounds so fresh"", on next track ""Can You Feel""-- and that they're often spoken unexpressively rather than sung-- probably won't attract many new fans.</p>
<p>Whatever makes Client so lacking in personality isn't just the lyrics, however. When they cover Curtis Mayfield's ""Make Me Believe in You"", the words are still fairly rote-- ""You are my temptation/ Show me inspiration""-- but the frosty Eurodisco rendition doesn't give you much reason to seek this one out instead of Amerie's faithful 2007 cover, let alone Patti Jo's Tom Moulton-remixed 1973 soul jam. (Is it better than Duffy's awfully similar neo-soul hit ""Mercy"", though? Maybe.) Still, the problem can't be the craftsmanship, which is consistently excellent, whether in the glam stomp of ""Son of a Gun"" or woozy dream-pop of ""In My Mind"". Chugging, midtempo tracks like ""Don't Run Away"" and ""Ghosts"", arguably the catchiest songs here, recall the slick mid-1990s electro-rock of Butch Vig's Garbage, for better and worse.</p>
<p>Biggest bummer of all: The timing was right for a late-career breakthrough. Client were never as glamorous as Goldfrapp, never as shrill and willing to experiment as Adult., never as shoegaze-indebted and affecting as Ladytron. But when it comes to contemporary peers like Little Boots and La Roux, <i>Command</i>'s minimalist songwriting and high-end production don't put them far behind. It's just that, once again, Client's fondness for anonymity threatens to keep them that way. If I'm repeating past reviews here, well, does this look like great poetry?</p></div>"|13208.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13208-command/|5.2|Marc Hogan

The package presumably offers something for both esoteric dancefloors and somewhat less exclusive July-time vibe fests, though the disjointed nature and the varying quality of the mixes makes the <i>Bugged Out</i> package a bit of a head-scratcher.</p>
<p><i>Bugged Out</i> plays more confrontational and pounding than might be expected from a group last seen translating Half Nelson/Willie Nelson gags into electro-soul balladry. It's tempting, too, to question the utility of the mix, which is only minimally (no pun intended) dance-y, exhibits only sporadic interest in proper transitions, and features plenty of knuckled-over faves. Gas smoothes the opening minutes; Preverlist's ""Junktion"" strangles a middle section; Gabriel Ananda and Dominik Eulberg's ""Eucalypse Now!"" pounds near the end (there's also a track here by Pitchfork contributor Philip Sherburne). Three minutes of an exclusive Hot Chip track, ""Take It In"", offers a minor incentive. The track rumbles darkly, Alexis Taylor's easy vocals skinning over its carving bass; a nice treat, but rightly exiled in compilation/B-side/mix territory.</p>
<p>The mix does pick up some steam, climaxing with the wordless, hazy house of Ican's ""Chiclet's Theme"" before starting slowly, steamily downhill. Closing the set at more than eight minutes, Max Cooper's ""I (Long Version)"" is a bit of a trek (most tracks clock in between two and four minutes), but the hints of optimism buried in its ruby synths are a fine note to close on. Ultimately, <i>Bugged Out </i>camps in the purgatory between ""actual taste-making dance mix"" and ""an interesting mix by artists you enjoy,"" though any indie-rockin' Hot Chip fans looking to explore the engine that propelled ""Ready for the Floor"" might find something to explore here.</p>
<p>The wildcard second mix (<i>Bugged In</i>), on the other hand, isn't as concerned with form or function, earning its seasonal peg with a near-schizophrenic but always warming mix of balmy techno, smooth rock, and fluttery other. The set begins abstractly, with the curators' remix of the Pictish Trail's ""Winter Home Disco"" (hell, just ignore the title) but quickly burns through calypso (the Andrews Sisters' unskippable ""Rum &amp; Coca Cola""), hammering techno (Greco-Roman Soundsytem's ""Party Rhythm""), and utter oddity (the Esso Trinidad Steel Band's take on the Kinks' ""Apeman"") before settling into the windchime lull of Osborne's ""16th Stage"". From there <i>Bugged In</i> rolls Man Like Me's ""London Town"" into Fleetwood Mac's ""Love in Store"", whose 8th-note thrum seems like a natural continuation of ""16th Stage"".</p>
<p>There are some hokey choices-- we probably don't need the Doobie Brothers' ""What a Fool Believes"", and Dub Narcotic Sound System's ""Shake a Puddin'"" mucks up the momentum-- but even 1980s standards like Hall &amp; Oates' ""I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)"" and Luther Vandross' ""Never Too Much"" feel like natural, light-funk choices (also, re-explore ""Just a Friend"" outside of a beer commercial). Sparks' ""The Number One Song in Heaven"" is such a natural antecedent to Hot Chip's dork-disco that its inclusion feels obvious in hindsight.</p>
<p><i>Bugged In</i>'s mix work is still a tad uneven, but no one on your rooftop, or in your Volkswagen, or between your ears will notice, because it plays well anywhere, a slick reminder of Hot Chip's charm and quirk. That it is, however slightly, weighed down by the darker clubroom thump of <i>Bugged Out</i> is responsible for the somewhat depressed score you see above. Make no mistake: <i>Bugged In</i> is worth your poolside July, and doubly so if you're likely to get anything more than ""oh, another decent mix"" out of <i>Bugged Out</i>.</p></div>"|13185.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13185-a-bugged-out-mix-by-hot-chip/|6.9|Andrew Gaerig

Guitars sound like crap? No discernible emotional content? <i>Pass the bowl, maan</i>-- that's not music for a pop audience, that's a self-esteem boost for guys who like to hit on tortured girls with Cramps tattoos in record shops. I mean, sure: Plenty of bands, from the Jesus and Mary Chain to the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, really do make noise-drenched pop music. It's just that you can find plenty <i>more</i> bands who make noise-drenched <i>art</i> music, records that reaffirm their buyers' superiority over the unsophisticated rabble (often, without actually being superior). Now, don't get me wrong-- I like a lotta that stuff, too!-- but if you think your average lo-fi/shitgaze scenesters have anything to say to the broader <i>21st Century Breakdown</i>-buying, ""American Idol""-watching public, you've been living in Greenpoint too long. And you should sign me to your label.</p>
<p>""I aim to sum up something so neatly that my friend Muiris will go, 'Ah, nicely said,'"" So Cow main man Brian Kelly told the blog Hi-Fi Popcorn last year. ""I like the idea of someone listening and going, 'Ah, that's what I thought!"" If you've ever been young and unlucky in love, the Irish multi-instrumentalist has a song that will strike exactly that kind of emotional chord. Like Television Personalities or the Clean at their most engaging, Kelly plays rickety guitar-pop that sounds homemade without feeling insular. <i>So Cow</i> compiles the best of Kelly's singles and self-released CDs so far, remastered by underground rock luminary Bob Weston. Sing-along hooks and scruffy charm abound.</p>
<p>First, though, you'll have to tear yourself away from the best few songs. ""Shackleton"" would be equally perfect for Death Cab fans' mixtapes, Belle and Sebastian fans' weddings, and closing-credit sequences for Chuck Palahniuk film adapations; here Kelly updates the ol' love-songs-about-love-songs trope (cf. the Divine Comedy's ""Perfect Lovesong"", the Lucksmiths' ""Sunlight in a Jar"", Elton John's ""Your Song"") as near-perfectly imperfect organ-and-drum-machine swoon-pop: ""One day I'll write the song you require/ Until then, la la la."" He turns out to be similarly adept at extended adolescence on the off-kilter ""Halcyon Days"", at droney bitching about his life's lack of resemblance to Hollywood romance on ""Casablanca"", and at tender <i>non sequiturs</i> on <i>Pinkerton</i>-style acoustic finale ""To-Do List"" (""a one, a two, a one to-do list...""). You might not know Korean pop star Moon Geun Young, but if you can't relate to the eponymous So Cow song's red-lining tale of an awkward breakup beneath a smiling billboard, well-- such sweet sorrow, I guess.</p>
<p>Kelly already has put out two full-length So Cow CDs himself, plus an EP and the occasional single, so it's hard to fault him for wanting to overload his proper debut LP. But for all the easy wit and superabundance of ideas bursting from doomed-love punk-popper ""Greetings"" or wobbly-synth duel ""So Cow vs. the Future"", <i>So Cow</i> would be a more cohesive listen without its few <i>under</i>whelming moments-- breakup thrasher ""Normalcy"", maybe, or breakdown ramble ""Exclamation Mark"". And I know Kelly recorded a lot of these songs while living in South Korea, but his lyrics are so sharp that the couple of Korean-language tracks just don't put So Cow's best foot-- hoof? (sorry!)-- forward. Then again, the dreamier ""Ping Pong Rock"", which drops more band names than this review without ever losing sight of a bright melody, shows one way Kelly could get more textural without going all abstract.</p>
<p>Listen, nobody understands better than me the impulse to wanna set yourself apart from people who can't see the greatness of, say, Deerhoof or Kirsty MacColl, both of whom So Cow has covered. You know the old punk single ""Whole Wide World"" by Wreckless Eric? Whether you first heard it through John Peel or from that one Will Ferrell movie, <i>So Cow </i>might give you the same type of feeling-- and if you hate this music, at least you won't have to put up with being told you ""don't get it."" That's the art of pop.</p></div>"|13167.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13167-so-cow/|7.7|Marc Hogan

Most of Exile's affectations-- billowy low tenor, showy buildups, rugged everyman looks, the glitzy stage name-- all point towards showbiz. The result is that Shaw's third album, and first for Warp, <i>Listening Tree</i>, sometimes sounds like <i>Electronica: The Musical </i>with Shaw playing the sashaying lead. It's occasionally a bit hokey, but <i>Listening Tree</i> trades on Shaw's genre-hopping to build aggressive, kinetic dramas.</p>
<p>Any of you crossover kids carrying your new Field record in a Smalltown Supersound tote and accustomed to your electronic music pattering on blissfully, beware: <i>Listening Tree</i> is an album where things properly happen-- lyrically, sure, but also musically. Shaw takes many of his cues from non-linear boom-bappers like Aphex Twin or, if you're looking for someone more theatrical and obscure, Plaid. His compositions spatter and pluck and tumble outwards, each indelicate sound unfurling from another. <i>Listening Tree</i>'s songs are so motion-oriented, in fact, that Shaw's Scott-Walker-fronting-the-Human-League vocals often serve as the calming influence.</p>
<p><i>Listening Tree</i> is the first Tim Exile album to play as a fully-formed song cycle, but it's hardly surprising that Shaw, a classically trained violinist who holds a master's degree in electroacoustic composition, would continue to explore his artistic boundaries. The results are mixed. On the slowbeat closer ""I Saw the Weak Hand Fall"", Shaw draws a convincing line between himself and crooners like Dave Gahan or early-90s Bowie. ""Family Galaxy""'s everything-to-everyone pop opera suggests Shaw operates under different rules than most of his electronic peers. On the title track, on the other hand, Shaw limits his feverish mashing, allowing its pounding grandeur to develop naturally.</p>
<p>The buzzing, wordless paranoia of ""There's Nothing Left of Me But Her and This"" shows Shaw can still produce the type of earworms he built his reputation on. The verses of ""Bad Dust"" are so cloistered and devilish they'd fit comfortably on a Coil album, but the wide-open choruses just as easily co-opt Smiths-style melodrama: ""I'm lying in the gutter/ Watching stars come crashing down upon my head.""</p>
<p>But then, the hokiness. ""Pay Tomorrow"" is four minutes of panging, bass-heavy thwump, warning of the evils of... credit card debt (A chorus: ""Life is such a breeze, we're all so pleased it's got no consequences/ So let's indulge our senses and burn next year's finances""). ""Carouselle"" rallies awkwardly against class inequality and the broken promises of consumerism; think <i>Les Misérables</i> but with more sequencers and, er, less humor.</p>
<p>Put aside for a moment some awkward stance-taking-- hell, it's half-refreshing to hear-- and note that <i>Listening Tree</i> is just an exhausting, demanding listen. Shaw's got the chops to concoct a showy, mutant-electronic opus that tosses genres-- IDM, drum'n'bass, electro-- around like ragdolls, but there's rarely any attention paid to pacing or to textures that exist outside the realm of ear-scraping techno-fabrics. <i>Listening Tree</i>'s big-idea stomp is daring, contagious, and commendable. It's a singular sound that's as trying as any of the year's scarier noise records, but it's also uncompromising: a pop-music dealbreaker, even for fiscally responsible, architecturally dashing electro-pop.</p></div>"|13188.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13188-listening-tree/|5.7|Andrew Gaerig

Looking to break away from computer-based methods, the Oakland-based composer turned to cassette tapes. After recording various source material (piano, percussion, sinewave oscillators, etc) onto cassettes, Kowalsky would play them on mono tape players around a room and vary the volume levels of each. ""Depending on where each member of the audience is located, they will hear the piece slightly differently than the person next to them,"" he explains in the press materials for <i>Tape Chants.</i> This unique performance process lies somewhere between the early phase experiments of Steve Reich and the ""third ear"" psycho-acoustic work of Maryanne Amacher.</p>
<p>It also provokes the question of whether Kowalsky could create as interesting an experience on record. He admits that <i>Tape Chants</i>, his second full-length for Kranky, ""does not try to replicate the surround sound component of the live performances."" But he used a similar process to make these pieces, adding what he calls ""rhythmic textures"" to the tape mixing. The result is a set of well-crafted drones that fans of the Kranky catalogue or any other ambient music should appreciate. The uniqueness of the live show, however, doesn't come across here. You can tell a lot of work went into Kowalsky's music, but you can't really tell what kind of work. So without the visuals or three-dimensionality of the performance, Kowalsky's drones have to suffice on their own.</p>
<p>And they pretty much do. <i>Tape Chants </i>opens with ""Invocation"", a minute-long track of tactile, engine-rev drone. But Kowalsky stumbles by following that with his least interesting (and longest) piece. ""I-IV"" lasts for 21 minutes, and a good portion of that is taken up by motionless, organ-like tones. Of course, a lot of good drone can be described that way, but here the stasis isn't counterbalanced by enough sonic texture or variety. About halfway through, a bassy rhythm takes hold in the background, giving the track a distinct boost. But even that element never quite gathers steam or rises into something new, and ""I-IV"" could have been as interesting-- maybe even more so-- at a third of its length.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Tape Chants </i>is more varied, and more engaging. Kowalsky's drones get denser and moodier as they progress, gathering sonic dust and debris to become more like field recordings than studio compositions. On ""VI-VII"", his tones begin with a sandy hue, then drift into low-end rumble and what sounds like acoustic string plucks. In contrast to ""I-IV"", this piece is busy and active, with different strains of sound humming alongside each other like insects. The same goes for the ultra-quick ""VIII""-- less than a minute of phasey, tactile howl-- and especially ""IX"", whose thick, piano-ish echo conjures thoughts of Labradford scoring a grainy horror film. It's moments like that in which Kowalsky's process takes a back seat to the end result.</p>
<p>Don't come here expecting all Labradford-style cinematics, though. Kowalsky's work so far is mostly for hardcore drone-fans, and even they might not be blown away by <i>Tape Chants</i>. But anyone can appreciate Kowalsky's attention to detail, and that thorough approach seems destined to produce a more unique statement-- whatever process it takes to get there.</p></div>"|13156.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13156-tape-chants/|6.6|Marc Masters

But in a very short time, the country's indie output-- at least as perceived from these shores-- seems to have advanced two decades, with acts like the Legends and Pacific! finding inspiration in the sounds of the early 1980s. In this regard, Jonathan Johansson is a new romantic, but not necessarily a New Romantic. He doesn't dress outlandishly or portray himself as particularly androgynous, but that label (those two words divorced of their pop-historical meaning) nicely sum up the bruised emotionalism and chilly synthcraft of his Swedish-language debut, <i>En hand i himlen</i> (which translates roughly to ""A Hand in the Sky""). On these ten songs, he sounds resolutely downcast, but with a stubborn optimism only a true romantic could feel, with his heart on his sleeve and heavy thoughts on his mind. In reviving these old sounds, Johansson locates a compelling paradox: His music communicates emotions so acute they can be conveyed only with the most coldly mechanistic instruments available.</p>
<p>Johansson and multi-instrumentalist Johan Eckeborn erect an enormous wall of electronic sound on <i>En hand i himlen</i>, with each song demonstrating new tricks. The title track is densely layered around an ""and"" beat snare pattern, building into soaring choruses and fading away into softer verses. Corkscrew synths etch a delicate melody throughout the downcast ""Innan vi faller"", whose mopiness is offset by its graceful segue into the relatively upbeat ""Högsta taket, högsta våningen"". Johansson and Eckeborn create different textures and tones from their machines, but track to track there is an ebb and flow that makes <i>En hand i himlen</i> play seamlessly. ""Sent för oss"", pushed along by a frantic bass rhythm, charges along at a fast clip into the stark ""Du sa"", which sounds austere but not antiseptic. With a sprinting drumbeat that threatens to leave the performers behind, ""Säg vad ni vill"" provides the album's climax and an opportunity for Johansson to show off his surprisingly agile voice, which moves effortlessly from wounded to triumphant, from a low whisper to a falsetto that almost sounds indistinguishable from the synths themselves.</p>
<p>One song obviously stands out, although its title gives few clues. ""Alla vill ha hela världen"" translates to ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World"", and yes, it's a Tears for Fears cover. Johansson doesn't mess with the original much beyond singing in Swedish-- this isn't a Gary Jules-style makeover-- and while the choice may be obvious, the song fits well enough on the album, finding a balance between defiant and resigned, between introverted and extroverted. Johansson may be playing off certain early 80s styles and signifiers on <i>En hand i himlen</i>, but on this impressive debut, he never sounds merely imitative. Instead, he cribs from that decade only to suit his own emotional, expressive ends.</p></div>"|12817.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12817-en-hand-i-himlen/|7.6|Stephen M. Deusner

On ""Least Favorite  Rapper"", guest Nocando spits, ""The suburban kids say I'm  not street enough/ But compared to them, I'm street as fuck.""   It's that combination of self-awareness, self-deprecation, and, ultimately,  self-defense that's played a large role in defining the Busdriver  Experience over nearly a decade of way-left-of-the-dial hip-hop. Though  too bizarro for mainstream acceptance, it actually works in his  favor; as  much as Busdriver appeals to the technically obsessed purists, he might  even hold as much appeal for people who'd otherwise avoid hip-hop  completely.</p>
<p>Still nothing's gonna stop Busdriver from critiquing just about everybody outside of the  Project Blowed collective-- an aim that makes <i>Jhelli Beam </i> feels at times less than laser-guided.  ""Least Favorite  Rapper"" initially sounds like it's got a serious case of the Paul  Barmans-- check the blood-curdling opener: ""These sneaker geek MCs  to me are so Brokeback/ So fuck sexy, in '09 I'm bringing broke back.""   But the reason it actually ends up being funny (Nocando is ""vibing  witcha like Michael Richards"" before letting off a Tommy-gun blast  of the word that ended his career) lies in how it sounds like it's  actually parodying indie rappers complaining about strawmen (""He sells  more drugs than the FDA/ He's ready for war like FDR"") than making  an actual critique of the mainstream rap scene.  At least I hope  that's what it is: These guys do realize the Next Great Hope (as of  June 2009) of hip-hop played a wheelchair-bound high school kid on a  Canadian sitcom, right?</p>
<p>As always, Busdriver is about as  technically impressive as an MC can get, the cultural vocabulary of  DOOM funneled through Doseone's vocal dexterity (though as a singer,  Bus is far more unhinged).  Hey, I love both of those guys, but  there's a reason you don't hear too many people thinking they should  borrow from each other.  I can think of a handful of times where I can  hardly believe that this stuff can be listened to for enjoyment-- Bus  plays cat and mouse with Mozart's ""Piano Sonata No. 11 in A Major""  on lead single ""Me-Time"" with stunning agility, and while it's  admittedly the kind of thing you'd like to see him pull of live, I  can't so much vouch for him appropriating Carl the Groundskeeper's  gopher song from ""Caddyshack"" (""Handfuls of Sky"") or ""This  Old Man"" for a tribute to Project Blowed loyalty (""I've Always  Known"").</p>
<p>""Art rap!"" he declares  at the beginning of ""World Agape"", as if you couldn't tell from  the erratic jazz-tom rolls that comprise its two and a half minutes.   But it's tough to tell just how much Busdriver's in on the joke--  the very first words of <i>Jhelli Beam </i> are ""conscious rap failed us,"" and later on, he sneers ""underground  rap happened 10 years ago"" before admitting that people in his position  get ""no kudos for being a pseudo-commie"" despite functioning ""under  the awning of [his] moral high ground."" Thanks to typically club-evasive but inventive beatmaking  from long-time associates Nobody, Daedalus, and Nosaj Thing meshing wonderfully  with Busdriver's torrential flow, <i>Jhelli Beam </i> somehow can be enjoyable just as an in-one-ear-out-the-other experience;  you can enjoy the clap-happy cadence of ""Manchuria"" or ""Quebec  And Back""'s goblin-like vocal effects completely worry free.</p>
<p>But once you get yourself involved,  there's no turning back-- you just brave the storm of proper nouns  and pop culture detritus to the point where it's a Girl Talk-style  game of ""oh, hey-- I recognize that!"" but not a Girl-Talk-style listen  for, well, pleasure. The question then become whether you can maintain  interest in how much effort Busdriver exerts to get across... god knows  what.  It takes a couple of pushes on the rewind button to cobble  together how ""Dane Cook table reads"" and ""anal beads"" can constitute  a rhyme, let alone ""bouillon cubes,"" ""oolong tea,"" and ""Moveon.org."" Why should I call  him ""Scoliosis Jones""?</p>
<p>Taken in context with just  about everything else, it's another reference to Busdriver  willing to let his freak flag fly, but since when was clarity such anathema?   Particularly in a situation where the <i>heads</i> that Bus seeks out  are equally into a rap classic that boasted, ""I don't rhyme for the  sake of riddlin'"" as they are into the ""spiced out Calvin Coolidge/ Loungin'  with seven duelers"" classic.  In the end, yes, <i>Jhelli Beam </i> manages to be a completely cerebral experience and at times overwhelming  in a satisfactory way, but then again, you could say the same about  ice cream headaches.</p></div>"|13228.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13228-jhelli-beam/|6.2|Ian Cohen

Some of the groups from previous <i>Kitsuné Maison</i> compilations have started playing live together under the tagline ""Kitsuné En Vrai!"" (""Kitsuné for Real!""). The influential French dance imprint has even taken to holding promotional contests: Your face could be on the next comp's crazy cover collage! As trend pieces about blogs give way to trend pieces about Twitter, the ragtag style of electronic music most memorably-- if least descriptively-- lumped together as ""blog house"" has become, almost literally, yesterday's news.</p>
<p>And Kitsuné, after seven of these things, has long since lost its element of surprise. That's sort of what happens when you help launch the careers of Bloc Party, Hot Chip, Simian Mobile Disco, Klaxons, Crystal Castles, and basically every fashionably trashy electro-punk act that isn't Justice. This is good, of course, but ascendancy can breed complacency. One way to look at last year's <i>Kitsuné Maison 6: The Melodic One</i> is as a victim of the series' success, largely playing it safe with glossed-up but less-great takes on the kind of banging rock-meets-dance hybrids these guys have been championing since the first half of the decade. Even so, there were still left turns (a ballad!) and blogworthy newcomers (Heartsrevolution, Ted &amp; Francis).</p>
<p><i>Kitsuné Maison 7</i> is a slight but welcome improvement over its predecessor. Bright guitar pop and mellow psych-outs now go with the usual French Touch-ed electro-house thumps. The type of slow and spaced-out disco lately repopularized by Lindstrøm, Studio, and others fields its biggest <i>Kitsuné Maison</i> representation yet. Sure, with 19 tracks (plus a 20-second ""encore"" break), the album still sometimes errs toward the generically danceable instead of the truly memorable. But the best cuts easily reconfirm the label's ear for promising talent.</p>
<p>Not that you need Kitsuné to tell you Phoenix are fucking awesome, but a remix by L.A. duo Classixx gives <i>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix</i>'s ""Lisztomania"" a gorgeously pillowy synth-disco framework, sort of like Simian Mobile Disco's ""I Believe"" or Friendly Fires' ""Paris (Aeroplane Remix)"". Also graceful is Prins Thomas' ""Sneaky Edit"" of London folktronica singer/songwriter James Yuill's ""This Sweet Love"", with its feathery acoustic guitar and house beats suggesting a cosmic disco re-edit of José González-- or Matthew Sweet. Northern Ireland's Two Door Cinema Club open the comp with breezy pop, like a bubblegum Phoenix with Vampire Weekend on chirruping lead guitar. To give you an idea how mellow this disc can be: L.A.'s Heartsrevolution, last seen making croaky basement electro-punk the Crystal Castles way, are back this time with a woozy music-box commencement lullaby (and a neat <i>The Little Prince</i>-inspired video).</p>
<p>Other choice selections include more predictable Kitsuné jams. New York blog darlings the Golden Filter stick to their Glass Candy-glazed nu-disco on ""Favorite Things"", which happy-birthday-Mr.-Presidents its target demo's turn-ons: ""Paris, London, sweet girls, cute boys, vodka, whiskey, cameras, pictures."" Nobody on Lookbook.nu listens to Coltrane? And new act Maybb, widely rumored to be an alias for big-time Eurohouse DJ/producer Benny Benassi, hits all the right Daft Punk buttons with ""Touring in NY (Short Tour Edit)"". Elsewhere, Manchester's Delphic flash promise on a euphoric house remix of their single ""Counterpoint"", all blinking synths and Underworld-echoing vocals.</p>
<p>Even the inessential tracks are still likely to sound good out, though they're less fun around the house. Chew Lips' ""Solo"" has the misfortune of sounding like Yeah Yeah Yeahs gone electro-pop in a year when Yeah Yeah Yeahs kind of went electro-pop. And you can tell the one with former Le Tigre members (Men's ""Make It Reverse"") by the jagged post-punk bass lines, the defiant vocals. French group Chateau Marmont's ""Beagle"" is space disco in the original 1980s sense, with vocoders and galloping Moroder synths; also not far from the unremembered 80s is Chromeo-plated electro-funk from Beni and ""Blue Monday"" gloom-marching from La Roux. Other tracks, like We Have Band's ""Time After Time"", sound like they're trying to do too much: Eastern European spoken-word? ""We'll be alone forever,"" a voice repeats on Crystal Fighters' ""Xtatic Truth (Xtra Loud Mix)"". Nah, just until Kitsuné starts following us all on Twitter.</p></div>"|13206.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13206-kitsune-maison-7-the-lucky-one/|7.3|Marc Hogan

I mean, we're talking about a band called the Sounds, so I reckon that sort of thing is, uh, par for the course. But this is the band's third pass at a long-player, and I can't help but bemoan the lack of top-down inventiveness that stares back before you even get a fingernail into the shrinkwrap. It's hard to tell what exactly the Sounds mean by suggesting their new record is some kind of can't-look-back moment, since looking back is precisely what they do, and have been doing their entire career: mining glitzy 1980s power-pop for effortless (and often sorta brainless) hooks. I'd say the point of no return for the Sounds was whatever band meeting found them settling on their moniker. Clearly, overintellectualizing matters isn't really what they set out to accomplish. But if they're putting out this river-crossing business, I've little choice but to offer up a cliché of my own: here, they're treading water.</p>
<p><i>Crossing the Rubicon</i> is a much better album if you don't think much about it; no easy task for a reviewer charged with poring over the finer points, I'll admit, but in the earbud era, not so tough for the casual listener. The Sounds of <i>Crossing the Rubicon</i> are certainly an appealing band on sonics alone, as they have been all along: Synth flourishes and chugging guitars underpin the powerful pipes of Maja Ivarsson at nearly every turn, and while it's short on subtlety, it gets by on pluck. This is shut-up-and-dance music, and that's just about all it ever intended to be. But <i>Rubicon </i>offers the occasional (if frustratingly infrequent) peek behind the curtain, periodic whiffs of more ambition than their pleasure-overload tunes usually suggest, and they're fascinating and frustrating by turns.</p>
<p>Fascinating, as this is clearly a formula that needs messing with. <i>Crossing the Rubicon</i> presents 50 minutes of thick-as-a-brick gloss-pop, all peaks and no valleys, nearly every song largely indistinguishable in melody and meter from the one that came before. And frustrating, because when they do make the occasional attempt to stretch out, they don't go far enough for you to notice unless you were paying close attention. The effort's appreciated, but the moments on <i>Crossing the Rubicon</i> that go for something less sprightly-- like the brief title track, which throws a bit more rumble behind their usual fare in a stab at ""epic,"" or the mercifully mood-breaking ballad ""The Only Ones""-- are far from surefooted, whereas the big pop moments kick just like they always have. It's no wonder they keep doing what they do; it works okay, and for a band who still call themselves the Sounds after 10 years and three LPs, it seems okay is what we can expect.</p>
<p>Which is not to say <i>Crossing the Rubicon</i> doesn't hold a few highlights, however relative. The ""Rapture""-echoing ""Beatbox"" won't help quell the Blondie comparisons that've followed this lot around since the start (which, usually, have been far too kind), but Ivarsson-- not a strong lyricist by any stretch-- avoids any car-eating chatter, and the song breezes by amicably enough on the strength of its bounce. ""Midnight Sun"" could be a pretty good-sized single, actually, and offers up a fitting mission statement for the band in its first verse: ""Embrace the land where the ocean meets the sand, and emotion fades away."" This is the synth-pop equivalent of Ibiza getaway music: spirited but oddly dispassionate background noise, utility and order über alles. That in mind, I can see myself enjoying it a great deal more were I not thinking about it, writing about it, picking it apart. But that doesn't excuse that this is their third album in this vein; we only needed this one the once.</p>
<p>Listening to <i>Crossing the Rubicon</i>, I'm reminded of my long-ago defense of the Killers' <i>Hot Fuss</i>: put it on in a dark room stuffed with people and tell me how much that ""I'm not a solider"" line bothers you. Of course, there's nothing on here quite so enduring as Mr. Flowers and company's early seedlings, but the comparison's apt nonetheless. This is a decently crafted, moderately hooky, fairly vacuous power-pop album, and under the right light, you could do a whole lot worse. But I also can't help but think of their fellow Scandi-poppers Love Is All, who've made a pair of awfully similar, totally great party records of their own lately at a similar pace, infused with humor and pathos and Josephine Olausson's wooly howl. Both albums don't sound too bad in the dark, but I'll tell you which one I'll reach for in the daytime.</p></div>"|13155.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13155-crossing-the-rubicon/|3.7|Paul Thompson

<p>Tiga may not have yet figured out the LP format: the sequencing of <i>Ciao!</i>, which front-loads six bangers before its gauzier second half, is divisive to the point of distraction. But <i>Ciao!</i> also feels more lived-in than 2006's <i>Sexor</i>, which relied on the misguided recurrence of ""Planet Sexor"" and several covers-- long a staple of Tiga's catalog-- to form a song cycle. <i>Ciao!</i> has its silly moments-- I once walked cross-room to my iPod muttering ""please don't be singing 'Sex O'Clock'""; ""Shoes"" might actually owe a debt to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCF3ywukQYA"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Liam Kyle Sullivan's goof"">Liam Kyle Sullivan's goof</a> of the same name-- but they at least advance the image of Tiga as a Prince-indebted persona capable, at any given moment, of extreme silliness, eroticism, or wistfulness.</p>
<p>More importantly, Tiga establishes themes on <i>Ciao!</i> of far greater consequence than ""there is a mythical sex planet."" <i>Ciao!</i> sort of covers a lot of ground, but basically it's a reflection on music and companionship, moving from the emptiness/fulfillment of luxury and sex to holy-shit-the-sun's-up, club-closing malaise. The end-of-album reflection-epic sums it up best: ""Love don't dance here anymore/ Found a new place to go.""</p>
<p>Enough of the AP English essay, though: if you're here, it's for Tiga's penchant for busty electro-bangers, and <i>Ciao!</i> provides plenty of dancefloor fodder. (A track like ""Beep Beep Beep"", which rails against the anonymity of modern life before taking comfort in a lover, probably contains too much plot and sentiment for a Tiga song anyhow). ""What You Need"" stands as the best of the album's flossy first half, beginning with a riotous, overloaded squelch and pushing through nearly six minutes of burly dancefloor mash. ""Luxury"" pans a quick, nasal rhythm around a surprisingly virtuoistic keyboard solo. A low-slung, heavily filtered bass plows the way for ""Mind Dimension"", as buzzy and aggressive as anything Crystal Castles muster.</p>
<p>The second half of <i>Ciao!</i> features less bodyrock, but its relatively soothed tones and thrumming beats are a surprising fit for Tiga. ""Turn the Night On"", the most ""proper"" pop track Tiga's ever been involved in, juxtaposes rippling arpeggios with clean piano and Tiga's restrained vocals: ""So many choices in the world/ So many boys, so many girls... It's harder than you think."" The whole package sounds a little like an adenoidal Junior Boys song, or maybe an early-80s Lou Reed LP sped to 45 rpm. ""Gentle Giant"", the only song to tack both a writing and a producing credit on James Murphy (he also produced ""Sex O'Clock""), massages loping chords and a hollow, looping electronic drum into what is, by some measure, Tiga's most nakedly heartfelt song: ""Youth don't fail me now/ I need just one last favor/ One song and another dance to let me feel in love tonight.""</p>
<p>The 10-plus minute coda ""Love Don't Dance Here Anymore"" threatens tedium with its white-piano balladry before a pulse-quickening sequencer and a tapping tom rechart the song's course. It's a fittingly epic closer for an album, perhaps the surest sign yet that Tiga's interested in crafting cohesive statements, and not just a series of novelties (as fun as <i>Sexor</i> was, there was little evidence that it was more than a diversion from Tiga's singles and deck-work). Tiga's still not a dancefloor chameleon like Basement Jaxx and he's not yet as pop-oriented and clever as say, the Pet Shop Boys, but <i>Ciao!</i> at least sees him glancing in those directions.</p></div>"|13199.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13199-ciao/|7.4|Andrew Gaerig

New York's mostly <i>meh</i> burrito situation and my still eating 'em all the time anyway aside, when you're a dutiful digital audio consumer, sometimes you've gotta run for the border. Round these parts that usually means Calexico, a Tejano-tinged indie rock group as picturesquely perfect for their fine Tucson, Ariz., as a Saguaro cactus in rosy sunset silhouette. But you can go back as far as you want: If you believe Lester Bangs, Ritchie Valens' ""La Bamba"" begat every punk rock song ever. If you believe fellow critic Chuck Eddy, Babe Ruth's ""The Mexican"" begat every <i>disco </i>song ever. And if you believe rock, punk, disco, all that stuff exists to be contrary, to take people's expectations and give 'em a good poke in the eyeball-- to the point where it's almost not contrary to be contrary anymore-- then you shouldn't even be surprised. <i>Of course</i>, rock would thrive in the desert. Whadda punk.</p>
<p>The Curious Mystery aren't from the desert. They're from Seattle. Doesn't matter. As soon as Shana Cleveland starts in with that smoky drawl-- ""If I go blind/ Hangin' out by a riverside/ Just stay with me""-- we're at the base of a rusty gorge with Cat Power on a Mazzy Star-ry night. (By the time Cleveland breaks off for an enigmatic chuckle, 10 tracks in, you're wondering whether she's really a safe person to stay with alone by a riverside on a night such as this.) Nicolas Gonzalez is a javelina-charmer on electric guitar and homemade Theremin. Add drummer Faustine B. Hudson and bass player Bradford Button, and you've got a four-piece doing unhurried psych-blues, autoharp ghost songs, and Area 51 garage-Americana, with plenty of that old frontier promise. Their debut LP might not be exactly what Kurdt Cobain used to expect from K Records-- you noticed the title's <i>Rotting Slowly</i>, right?-- but the Curious Mystery are well within the spirit of former Come frontwoman Thalia Zedek's unsentimental smolder. And when you get right down to it, who's the bigger outlaw: Calvin Johnson, or some schmo who can't drive just 55? Why is Sammy Hagar the one with his own brand of tequila?</p>
<p>Nobody ever tells the Grand Canyon to <i>get to the damn point</i>, and at times the Curious Mystery's slow-burning expansiveness helps set a nice acid-Western mood. Instrumentals undergo shifts both rhythmic and dynamic, showcasing Gonzalez's stormy leads, while even at <i>Rotting Slowly</i>'s most lyrical, on vivid and forceful standout ""Black Sand"" or the tenderly wasted ""Go Forth and Gather"", the Curious Mystery are rarely far from Beach House's druggy languour. ""You are the type that only moves slowly/ And I am the same,"" Cleveland murmurs on spindly epic ""Outta California"". When she isn't singing, though, these cowboy-junkie dirges tend to drift. And watch out for occasional clumsy overseriousness-- on the Gonzalez-sung ""Strong Swimmers"", with its Sonic Youth dissonance, two people are unlike everybody else in that they can swim, except it turns out they actually can't swim (see, a metaphor <i>can</i> bloom in the desert!). The Curious Mystery have the Southwestern scenery down pretty well. Now they just need to improve the accomodations for us city slickers. A guy can't live on Cabo Wabo alone. <i>...Or can I?</i></p></div>"|13120.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13120-rotting-slowly/|5.7|Marc Hogan

One of the first of many bold proclamations on <i>The Bachelor </i>goes ""in these hard times, we'll work harder,"" and whether you see him as an impish genius or a guy who'd be better off without an internet connection, you can't fault his commitment to craft-- all three of his previous records were meticulously imagined; all three sounded like the work of one man but rarely sounded like each other.</p>
<p><i>The Bachelor </i>ups the ambition ante even higher, but it's just as as notable for displaying Wolf at his most interdependent, fitting in guest shots from Alec Empire and Tilda Swinton. Wolf's changes have been gradual: After the origin story of <i>Lycanthropy</i>, 2005's <i>Wind in the Wires </i>longed for pastoral escape but sounded like it was recorded in a remote hidey hole, all of which made the gushing, Cure-styled romance of <i>The Magic Position</i> a bona fide breakthrough. After that record's major keys and genuine human connections, <i>The Bachelor </i>isn't a hangover album so much as one on which Wolf picks up the morning paper and, without really breaching any specific topic, realizes that we're all in this world of shit together.</p>
<p><i>The Bachelor </i>was initially conceived as a politically minded double-album entitled <i>Battle, </i>but Wolf's loves and depressions got the better of the initial plan-- either that, or he just realized that a politically minded double-album is a phenomenally bad idea. Nonetheless, the opening salvo of ""Hard Times"" and ""Oblivion"" are remnants of the aggressiveness Wolf set out for, the former recalling ""The Libertine"" in how it's prodded by a serrated, hooky string riff and the latter barreling forth with Wolf's most footloose electro-rhythms.</p>
<p>Most of <i>The Bachelor</i>'s strengths sound borne out of arrangements rather than visceral or melodic thrills. For better or worse, that's likely been preventing any sort of real crossover for Wolf despite his acclaim-- while ""Blackdown"" culminates with a lovely Celtic hoedown, it takes about four minutes of tear-stained ivory tinkling to get there, and ""The Sun Is Often Out"" follows up with diminishing returns, struggling for a tune until a coda of choirboy chanting tries to make the preceding events sound like they were building towards something cathartic.</p>
<p>Even with all the momentum-sapping balladry, <i>The Bachelor </i>could still be considered Wolf's most physical album. Musical vigor backing worldly attempts at lyricism, however, is better left to Green Day (wait, no, that's not right)-- and here Wolf too often overstates things in search of some sort of populist truth. More worrying is that, despite all of the instrumental bric-a-brac dotting <i>The Bachelor</i>, Wolf leans on a choral mass during all the big moments-- a choir hopes for revolution towards the end of ""Hard Times"", exalts the listener to ""rise up"" during the coda of the otherwise understated ""Damaris"", repeats the title of the seriously Bono-fide arena raiser ""Who Will?"", and that's covering about half of it.</p>
<p>Wolf's always had an unsteady hand at hard rock, going down the supermassive black hole of fight music on ""Battle"" is at least a bizarre novelty that's kinda funny. As far as other bizarre novelties, unsurprisingly, ""Tilda Swinton as 'The Voice of Hope'"" is as ridiculous to hear as it is to type, triggering unfortunate flashbacks to horribly dated Age of Virtual Reality relics like Billy Idol's <i>Cyberpunk </i>and Kirstie Alley styling on the interludes to Prince's<i> Symbol. </i></p>
<p>Strangely enough, Wolf's unclassifiable work to this point has managed to place him in a god-honest class of similarly minded Kate Bush acolytes-- but like St. Vincent and Bat For Lashes, there's the problem where stressing one's inner control freak can come at the expense of other freakiness. Or at least it can make any semblance of eccentricity feel micromanaged and forced, and Wolf lacks the former's humor or the latter's sultry songcraft to counterbalance it. Which admittedly sucks, because <i>The Bachelor </i>is still admirable in so many theoretical ways-- it's recorded almost flawlessly, and it appeals to the idea that an album is supposed to be an <i>album </i>of considered choices. Which is great, except that for all of the talk of Wolf being a chameleonic drama queen, oddball, or genius, <i>The Bachelor</i> most damningly lacks the charm attendant with any of those character descriptions, continuing Wolf's ability to please one's inner music critic, but too often ignoring any sort of pleasure principle.</p></div>"|13067.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13067-the-bachelor/|6.2|Ian Cohen

Not only were the formative years of St. Vincent, Bat for Lashes, and Lavender Diamond spent in a milieu in which such bracing women were topping critic's polls and storming <i>Billboard</i> charts, that same climate also nurtured so many thousands of fans who now make up a sizable chunk of indie's customer base. So it makes sense that so many listeners would be eager to herald up-and-coming young women who remind them of their middle-school heroines.</p>
<p>Cortney Tidwell definitely belongs on this list of recent female insurgents. Though her background sets her apart from the bigger names from the earlier era, Tidwell draws from them to an even greater degree than her contemporaries do, in addition to incorporating femme-heavy trip-hop, dream-pop, and shoegaze sources. Tidwell's family actually has deep roots in country music, her mother and grandfather having performed on the Grand Ole Opry, while her father continues to thrive as a recording engineer in Nashville. When you throw in the biographical tidbit that she was a Joy Division acolyte as a youth, I guess it's not difficult to surmise how the ""country goth"" tag got slapped on Tidwell's music at the outset of her career.</p>
<p>But despite a very occasional tendency to let her voice loom large and haunting like a spectral Patsy Cline, Tidwell's M.O. is miles removed from Music Row. She'd much rather adopt a girlish tone when singing, and dress up her compositions with dreamy keyboards, arty atmospherics, and occasional noise touches. At this point, after Ewan Pearson's terrific 2007 reworking of her ""Don't Let the Stars Keep Us Tangled Up"", Tidwell's biggest worry should be making sure she doesn't end up stuck in the Goldfrapp/Sia Furler career trap of being primarily reckoned as remix fodder.</p>
<p>Her sophomore effort, <i>Boys</i>, begins with a consummate red herring in the form of ""Solid State"", a smoky, noir-ish tease that perfectly fulfills the parameters of ""country goth,"" and which Tidwell of course spends the remainder of the album distancing herself from as much as possible (only ""Being Crosby"", a lovely duet with Jim James full of gently tugging acoustic guitars and faraway banjo, signifies ""country"" much at all). Tidwell gives immediate notice that she won't be catering to the <i>Paste</i> set anytime soon with the album's second track, ""Watusii"", a clanging, dissonant art-pop banger that offers <i>Boys</i>' first proof of significant Björk-ish predilections. ""Son &amp; Moon"" is this album's blatant <i>Vespertine</i> bite (joining ""I Do Not Notice"" from her debut), while ""Oslo"" reveals Tidwell learned a thing or two from Radiohead as well (namely, from <i>OK Computer</i>‘s guitars and <i>In Rainbows</i>' bass).</p>
<p>The charging ""So We Sing"" is refreshingly in-your-face and offers one of the album's most immediate refrains, but it gives way to a back half that starts bleeding into one slow, prettily atmospheric wash. It's a dreamy, wallpaper-ish rut that ""Palace"" and ""Oh, Suicide"" can't rise above, though ""Oh, China"" and ""17 Horses"" do distinguish themselves modestly thanks to the former's title-evoking rhythmic patterns and the latter's slightly pace-changing approximation of PJ Harvey.</p>
<p>I can understand Tidwell not achieving Bat For Lashes-like levels of success and acclaim, considering Natasha Khan's work is far more emotionally dynamic and immediately pleasurable. However, Tidwell does at least deserve to be reckoned as St. Vincent's peer-- her music may not be as brightly likable as Annie Clark's, but Tidwell is a more compelling vocalist and more stylistically omnivorous to boot. She may occasionally allow artiness to get in the way of enjoyableness on <i>Boys</i>, but Tidwell otherwise proves herself a worthy inheritor to the alt-rock personality queens of the 1990s.</p></div>"|13157.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13157-boys/|7.0|Joshua Love

He looks like any other regular Joe trying to look serious while wearing a hood. He isn't, though. Over the course of many albums and even more splits and EPs, Xasthur has become perhaps the biggest name in American black metal. Ironically, a cult of personality has sprung up around him because he has shunned the spotlight. He rarely gives interviews, withheld printed lyrics from his last album, and until now, has appeared only in grainy photos with face obscured by makeup. His unveiling might suggest some insight into the personality behind his sound. Instead, it brings greater obfuscation, as his music has become even more gnarled and disturbed.</p>
<p>In a world where ""metal"" isn't a dirty word, Conner could be hailed as some kind of composer genius. He's not a composer in the traditional sense; in fact, structural composition is his greatest weakness. Xasthur tracks tend to be long and droning and don't go anywhere. However, they reside in a unique place. Conner has taken the ""suicidal black metal"" pioneered by the likes of Shining and Silencer (who themselves were inspired by Burzum) into territories that strain metal's boundaries. Metal usually is big and strong. Xasthur is born of weakness, with tinny tones and strangled shrieks off in the distance. Songs don't involve riffs so much as miasmas of guitar. The gestures are basic-- slow jangles, mostly-- but they involve lots of ""wrong"" notes and indeterminate tonalities. Add broken church-organ keyboards and hyper-dramatic song titles (""Malice Hidden in Surrealism"", ""Funerals Drenched in Apathy""), and the results are crackpot, yet harmonically rich. Scoring Xasthur for string ensembles would befit horror movies.</p>
<p>Conner has perhaps realized this, as <i>All Reflections Drained</i> is hardly metal. Its mood is heavy, and it houses some distorted guitars. But keyboards and textures are more prevalent than ever; this record could be mistaken for Kronos Quartet on a binge of downers. Previous record <i>Defective Epitaph</i> was Xasthur's first with acoustic drums. Its songs weren't as endless as before, probably because Conner discovered that playing real drums was more troublesome than letting electronic ones do the work. His wobbly playing gave the record a crackly, crepitant quality. <i>All Reflections Drained</i> continues likewise, and feels even more ""foldable,"" due to strange editing techniques. Songs often morph mid-stream into unrelated grooves. At their best, they echo the Charles Ives effect of multiple ensembles playing against each other. At their worst, they feel like sketches pasted together haphazardly. Conner dislikes doing vocals, and thus this record is mostly instrumental. Pianos, dime store guitars, timpanis, and strings (real or synth, it doesn't really matter) swirl together in dirty, disharmonic soups. It's a mess-- sometimes frustrating, sometimes interesting, and always utterly depressing.</p></div>"|13085.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13085-all-reflections-drained/|6.0|Cosmo Lee

Timbaland's <i>Shock Value</i> sold more than a milli, nothing to sneeze Creatine at, but its distillation of the hip-hop heavyweight's sci-fi primitivism still sounds more like a victory lap than an actual victory. Swizz Beatz had at least one solid artist album in him, but he's no rapper, as the wait for a follow-up underscores. And N.E.R.D.? Um, you've heard those guys' other stuff, right? Pop's biggest producer-to-artist success stories, such as Kanye West, have become exceptions thanks in part to their outsize personalities.</p>
<p>That's where Miike Snow start to fall short. And not just because they briefly cloaked themselves in the whole ""ooh we're anonymous, who could we be?"" promotional trend that's been sweeping the blogs. True, you expect good things from Swedish producers Christian Karlsson and Pontus Winnberg, who as Bloodshy &amp; Avant produced Britney Spear's indie-kid-converting 2004 single ""Toxic"", among other tracks for the likes of Spears, Kylie Minogue, Madonna, Rachel Stevens, and Sugababes. But Scandinavia's recent indie-pop leadership notwithstanding, ""Swedish producers"" doesn't exactly scream ""would be interesting to hear by themselves at album-length."" Enter Downtown Recordings production regular Andrew Wyatt, of anthemic New York electro-rockers Fires of Rome (and previously of Black Beetle, with Jeff Buckley cohorts Joan Wasser and Michael Tighe).<i></i></p>
<p><i>Miike Snow</i> is about as exciting as all those biographical details would indicate. The debut album by these producers-turned-trio comes after blog-bait remixes galore, including a nice enough Postal Service-ish Vampire Weekend makeover, but there's little of those fine young Columbians' infectious exuberance here. Biggest surprise? Miike Snow largely trade in brash pop immediacy for low-key, piano-laden melancholy. Decent bummer of a first single ""Burial"", with its fluttery synths, tricky rhythms, and a couple of those vaguely exotic yelps currently <i>de riguer </i>in commercials for lime-flavored beer<i>,</i> is sort of like crying your eyes out to Phil Collins on a beach. Also like that, it's a bit nonsensical: ""This empathy is overrated/ Like a snapshot when you've lost the game."" Stop overrating those snapshots, people! The sunny West Coast harmonies of ""Faker"" and the oceanic calmness of ""Sans Soleil"" similarly suffice without quite standing out.</p>
<p>Miike Snow are better when they're more starlet-ready, though even then they could use an actual starlet. The thickly textured buzz-strut of ""Plastic Jungle"" is pretty close to Britney's ""Womanizer"", but instead of femme-bot purrs there's a whispery guy who wants to ""get slain."" Whether in the kiddie-pop lilt of opener ""Animal"", the Field-minding hypnotism of ""In Search Of"", or the glimmering electro-house thump of ""Silvia"" and the yearning ""A Horse Is Not a Home"" (no, not even in this real-estate market), the disc is rarely less than professional-grade. Faint praise, sigh.</p>
<p>So Miike Snow aren't half as potentially infuriating as a Kanye or a Timbaland, but they aren't half as lovable, either. More promisingly, the album's ""Black &amp; Blue"" splits the difference between Prince and piano-pop, only to underwhelm as a whole. The best track, the one with the Dirty Projectors-like flickering guitars, perfect for summer driving mixes: ""Song for No One"". Hello, is it me you're looking for?</p></div>"|13189.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13189-miike-snow/|5.0|Marc Hogan

Navel-gazing is one thing; taking a picture of said navel and posting it to your Tumblr with Blingees 'cuz it gave you a giggle, far different. Who knows what Los Angeles' Warlocks do with the black light on; all we have are their records, and <i>The Mirror Explodes</i> is the fifth proper. It may not be drug-induced, though it's certainly sticky with the resin of said creativity vehicle; this is a druggy album.</p>
<p>The Velvet Underground, once and always the template for most drug-rock worth its salt, are still the Warlocks' godhead, along with the swampier, swirlier moments of their fellow drag-chasers Kevin Shields and the brothers Reid. I realize it's reductive to suggest<i> Mirror</i> sounds like Kev playing the ""Loomer"" riff over ""Black Angel's Death Song"", but it's only reductive as that would be more awesome than this record turns out to be. Still, it's an equation they (and, to an even dronier extent, the Black Angels) have made a career of; they did, after all, have a tune called ""Song for Nico"" on their debut, and here we are eight years later.</p>
<p>Ironically, ""Song for Nico"" sounds like Big Star compared to<i> Mirror</i>, a record that picks a mood-- dark-- and sticks with it. The earlier Warlocks records played with space and tempo in a way <i>Mirror</i> casts aside in favor of front-to-back stoney, reverby sludge. Oddly enough, I'm reminded of a recent quote I read attributed to somebody or other from recently rejuvenated big beaters the Prodigy, suggesting that years 'round the bong had left him, however temporarily, with ""no personality."" I can't help but wonder whether that's the culprit for why <i>Mirror</i> feels so drab and tuneless, an album whose heavy lids bespeak a fairly narrow vision.</p>
<p>It's tough to get a hold on this record, since it's somewhat averse to melody or much shading beyond ""gray and slightly deeper gray."" A few tunes sway where others swarm, but they're all bathed in such fuzz it's a drag to differentiate. There are moments-- like the guitar flutter in the set's rockiest rocker, ""Frequency Meltdown"", or the pull of the Jesus and Mary Chainsaw around ""Slowly Disappearing""-- that pop out a bit, but the album does precious little to distinguish between tracks, let alone between itself and the work of other bands. Certainly the Warlocks at their most monochromatic, whereas in the past it seemed as though they couldn't help but bring a little light in. If they were going for ""bummed out in a basement"", well, they got it, but as in real life, that tends to be interesting only to those who made the trek down the stairs themselves.</p>
<p>This is where the selfishness thing comes in;<i> Mirror </i>never goes far out enough to be ""self-indulgent"" <i>per se</i>, but it does seem wrapped up in its own little bubble, and penetrating that is actually something of a chore. There's little dynamism in the arrangements, nothing particularly revelatory about the mostly-mumbled lyrics, and certainly nothing original about adding a fresh coat of black paint to the house that John Cale built. It'd be one thing if prolonged exposure to the fuzz resulted in a better understanding of these songs, but they're just as bleary on the first listen as the tenth, and they wind up sounding like somebody else's bad time, but not really one you'll want to call your own. Druggy records are never all that good when they don't convey anything about the experience other than the blur. That's not to say you couldn't get swept up in <i>The Mirror Explodes</i>' churn under the right influence, but it's not something to inspire the formation of many new memories.</p></div>"|13049.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13049-the-mirror-explodes/|3.4|Paul Thompson

Iconic solo debut <i>Black on Both Sides</i>: a stark, immediately-striking photo portrait that renders the attribution of his name unnecessary. Aggro experimental follow-up <i>The New Danger</i>: that same face now obscured by a stick-up man's mask, his bright red, bloody-looking index fingertip pointing to his own head on some <i>Taxi Driver</i> shit. Contractual obligation mishap <i>True Magic</i>: no actual album art whatsoever, with a blank-looking Mos staring into space off the surface of the disc itself. And now <i>The Ecstatic</i>, which depicts not Mos Def himself but a red-tinted shot from Charles Burnett's classic 1977 film <i>Killer of Sheep</i>. You might go so far as to say this indicates that the best way for Mos Def to reassert what he really means as an artist would be to take his as-seen-in-Hollywood face out of the equation entirely, replacing it with a shot from an entirely different strain of independent, neorealist cinema that more clearly gets at what he represents as a lyricist. Maybe it's a stretch, but what the hell.</p>
<p>And while Burnett's Watts isn't quite the same place as Mos Def's Bed-Stuy, it does exist as one of many geographical reference points in <i>The Ecstatic</i>'s international style. This is Mos Def's small-globe statement, an album that comfortably jumps stylistically across continents on a hip-hop goodwill-ambassador tour, prefaced by a statement from Malcolm X during his 1964 appearance at Oxford: ""I, for one, will join in with anyone, I don't care what color you are, as long as you want to change this miserable condition that exists on this earth."" It's a high-minded intro for an album that most people will hear first and foremost as the comeback bid of a rapper-turned-actor, but it also serves as an important indication that Mos actually gives a shit here, and that he has a stake in something greater than just one corner of the rap world.</p>
<p>It starts with the production, which originates from assorted French touch cats (Mr. Flash) and Stones Throw siblings (Oh No; Madlib) and the producer from <i>True Magic </i>who actually contributed a couple decentish beats (Preservation). Oh No usefully repurposes some of the Turkish psych from his album <i>Dr. No's Oxperiment</i>, particularly the massive Selda-sampling acid-rock monster ""Heavy"" for lead track ""Supermagic"". Madlib contributes a couple tracks from his <i>Beat Konducta in India </i>series, diverting in their original form but done real justice by Mos' rhythm-sparring flow (and, in the case of ""Auditorium"", Slick Rick's). Ed Banger alum Mr. Flash covers the Caribbean (""Worker's Comp""), the Middle East (""Embassy""), and neon Euro-American club-kid slickness (""Life in Marvelous Times""). And Mos' own co-production touches in conjunction with Preservation's beats drive it all home: ""Quiet Dog"" opens with a defiant Fela Kuti soundbite, ""Casa Bey"" is built off Banda Black Rio's samba-funk number ""Casa Forte"", and Mos spends the entirety of ""No Hay Nada Mas"" rapping and singing in Spanish. There's a good chance you've heard some of this before-- aside from the aforementioned Oh No and Madlib contributions, ""Life in Marvelous Times"" recycles Mr. Flash's beat for ""Champions"", his collaboration with French rappers TTC-- but it's not a stale familiarity, at least in the context of <i>The Ecstatic</i>'s ambitious B-boy diaspora.</p>
<p>But it wouldn't mean shit if it felt like the itinerary of a jet-set movie star showing everyone his vacation slides. Fortunately, the good thing about Mos Def not having brought his A Game in a while is that, like many rappers whose reputations have slipped, he was due for a something-to-prove moment. <i>The Ecstatic </i>has a bunch of those, smuggled inside the usual big-up Brooklyn and hip-hop preservationist lyricism and welded-to-the-beat flow that made him shine in '99, and his better turns of phrase have a way of sneaking up on you and smacking you in the back of the head. ""Soul is the lion's roar, voice is the siren/ I swing 'round, wring out and bring down the tyrant/ Chop a small axe and knock a giant lopsided,"" he proclaims on ""Auditorium"" with the kind of delivery that makes the complex and convoluted sound natural. His anti-wack-MC diatribes on ""Quiet Dog"", the gunfight-love narrative of ""Pistola"" and the tone of sardonic but sincere Afrocentrism on ""Revelations"" reveal the versatility he still maintains in his repertoire. And even when he's just rattling off ego-trip riffs, the way he locks into a beat is scary; it's kind of hard to notice or care that he mostly keeps repeating the same <i>Mary Poppins</i>-derived hook on ""Supermagic"" when every syllable is like another percussion instrument boosting that head-nod factor by ten.</p>
<p>There are still some moments of weird, dope-hazy fuck-around on Mos' part, and while they don't really distract to the point where they test your patience, the frequent times when he drops into quasi-aimless sing-song vamping-- or straight-up attempted singing-- give <i>The Ecstatic </i>the feeling of a weeded-out jam session that didn't always go entirely according to plan and somehow fell together anyways. Still, it's the kind of fucking around that's clearly coming from a dude who sounds liberated, and a lot of it-- like the outro in ""Pistola"" where he interpolates the Intruders' ""Cowboys to Girls"" over some Madlib-provided vibes and King Tubby cookie-sheet-smacking percussion, or the casually amped<span> don't stop the rock/can't keep me down declarations of closing track ""Casa Bey""-- is too damn joyous to feel over-indulgent. Even absurd stuff like the Spanish track and his cod-reggae delivery on ""Workers Comp"" (try not to crack up the first time you hear the way he sings ""fie-yerd"" in the chorus) are more eccentric than bad. And anyone who wants to complain about those, well, go enjoy ""History"" instead: It's a Black Star reunion over a Dilla beat. Looks like we finally got the Mos Def we were waiting for.</span></p></div>"|13161.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13161-the-ecstatic/|8.0|Nate Patrin

Miles Davis's <i>Kind of Blue</i>: ""the quintessential jazz album""; Coltrane's <i>Giant Steps</i>: ""a major landmark in jazz history""; Brubeck's ""Take Five"": ""one of the most popular tunes in jazz""; Ornette Coleman's <i>The Shape of Jazz to Come</i>: ""the essential free jazz album."" <i>Mingus Ah Um</i>? ""Essential to <i>Mingus fans</i> and <i>jazz aficionados</i>"" (emphasis mine).</p>
<p>Poor big-bellied, cigar-loving, temperamental, insecure, misogynistic Charles Mingus. While routinely placed on best-of-genre lists and talked about as one of the preeminent bassists and bandleaders in jazz, his best albums never clump comfortably with anyone else's, or with any particular subset of casual jazz listeners. They're too spirited for cocktail hour, too rough and moody for listeners who revel in crafstmanship, and not radical enough for daredevils.</p>
<p>Then again, Mingus' music never seemed comfortable outside its own world, either. At the dawn of both modal and free jazz, he kept solos short and music composed (even if, as with 1959's Atlantic recording <i>Blues and Roots</i>, the players didn't see the charts before the studio date). In an era where big bands were left behind for small combos or reimagined entirely (as with, say, John Coltrane's late albums), Mingus was a Duke Ellington acolyte who approached his pieces with the formality of an orchestral composer.</p>
<p>""Better Git It in Your Soul""-- if <span class=""il"">Mingus</span> had his own sound, <i>Mingus Ah Um</i>'s opener<i> </i>was it: a warm, striding, Sunday-morning tune carried on moaning horns; a friendly, convivial atmosphere punctuated by hollers Mingus didn't bother suppressing in the studio. <span class=""il"">Mingus</span>, born to a black father and Chinese-American mother who allowed only church music in the house, embraced blues and gospel in the complex way one embraces a friend they've fallen out of touch with, or their hometown-- cautiously; with a burdened and deep-buried love. The song never struck me as primitive or rootsy, but a comic-book version of primitive, rootsy music-- a form reduced to its most basic shapes and traits; a form almost abstracted.</p>
<p><span class=""il"">The album </span>rolls from there. And while ""Better Git"" is as good a definition of <span class=""il"">Mingus</span> there is, the album is remarkably diverse: Set pieces like ""Fables of Faubus"" or ""Jelly Roll"" (which are a jazz analog to the Beatles's warped, fruity variations on early British pop, like ""For the Benefit of Mr. Kite"") play alongside factory-pressed bop- and swing-style songs like ""Boogie Stop Shuffle"" and the mournful, reverent balladry of ""Goodbye Pork Pie Hat"". Harmonies invoke modern classical music almost as often as blues, and his chosen instrumentalists spend as much effort adding color to the ensemble as personality to their brief solos.</p>
<p>Regarding the product at hand: a 2xCD 50th anniversary ""Legacy Edition"" with a list price of $25. The remaster is the same one performed by Mark Wilder in the late 1990s and still in print. Along with a couple of alternate takes, the second disc contains <i><span class=""il"">Mingus</span> Dynasty</i>, an uneven and far less interesting album recorded later in 1959 and issued early in 1960. The liner notes are slim and strangely conceived (do I need to read that a song on this album is a ""grand slam home run"" even though I clearly have already purchased it?). The bonus material on the second disc, in PDF format, should've been in the booklet if they're charging $25 for a package that probably didn't demand a lot of work to re-release. That's that.</p>
<p>I'm sure I'm not versed enough in jazz to assess what it is that makes <span class=""il"">Mingus</span> <i><span class=""il"">Mingus</span></i>, but listening to <i>Ah Um</i> again-- an album I plucked from my dad's collection at age 15-- I remember sitting in my family's basement thinking that I had no idea jazz could be funny. (I hadn't yet heard Thelonious Monk.) I thought jazz was all elegance and poise. I remember reading transcriptions of Charlie Parker solos and wondering if my intellectual awe would translate to a real, visceral love of the music. It didn't-- I felt detached. <span class=""il"">Mingus</span> was slurring and gestural. His compositions that looked prim on paper sounded rusted and sun-bleached in performance. The fiery ones sounded a little tight-assed and penned-in-- you could almost hear the band bucking with discomfort at the form they found themselves playing in. The music had <i>character</i>; it beamed. Still does.</p></div>"|13163.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13163-mingus-ah-um/|7.8|Mike Powell

That in and of itself is something of an accomplishment considering the turnover that preceded it: longtime drummer Stephen Hewitt (whose most notable contribution to the group was letting a drum machine fill in on ""Pure Morning"") was replaced by a twentysomething refugee from a California pop-punk group, the band signed with Vagrant, and the group hired nu-metal maven David Bottrill (Tool, Staind, Godsmack) to produce the record. As you could guess from all of that, <i>Battle For the Sun </i>is meant as a rejuvenation of the Placebo brand-- the sort of thing where they're gonna ""get back to basics"" and just crank out the no-frills rock action. In other words, they've jettisoned just about anything that ever made them perversely enjoyable.</p>
<p>It's a fight they just can't win-- even during their better days, Placebo's appeal lay entirely in a sense that Brian Molko's routine was somehow subversive, along with the occasional blast of industrial rhythms and abrasive guitar noise. Now it's all major keys and keyboard fills and ""yes we can"" attitude like they have the arms to box with the gods in Muse. At least at the outset, Molko allows somewhat newer ideas to infiltrate otherwise airtight strictures of his songcraft. Most of them give the hint that he owns a copy of Bloc Party's <i>Silent Alarm</i>: the hand-clappy breakdown on the unfortunately titled and composed ""Kitty Litter"", ""Ashtray Heart"" and its massed pub-chanting (and if you've gotten this far, you might know Ashtray Heart was the band's original name).</p>
<p>But whatever tweaks got thrown in are all at the mercy of Bottrill's iron fist, and damn if the first word that comes to mind is ""merciless."" Though he appears to be using at least three strings on his guitar this time out, Molko's instrument is as processed, smooth, and tasteless as a pimento loaf, along with strings and horn blasts that are so canned they might as well be orchestra hit presets. The Billy Corgan-style metaphysics of ""The Never-Ending Why"" feel like they exist solely to hammer home how little bands of Placebo's ilk have learned about the loudness wars since the horrifyingly recorded <i>MACHINA. </i></p>
<p>But hell, I'm surprised as you are that I haven't brought up the lyrics yet. You probably know where this is going, but at least during Placebo's earlier work, Molko had something of a juvenile charm when he was beating Wavves to the weed/goth girls game by a decade. Somehow they've gotten worse. Though ""For What It's Worth"" has the record's fiercest hook, after what could pass for incidental ""Tetris"" music, the band stops midway for Molko to lament, ""No one cares when you're out in the streets/ Picking up the pieces to make ends meet/ No one cares when you're out in the gutter/ Got no friends ain't got no lover,"" before having the nerve to repeat it for the rest of the song. Whether he's rehashing ""Commercial For Levi""'s laughable attempt at PSA moralizing (""Julien"") or leading dead-horse clichés to the glue factory (""Devil in the Details"", ""Breathe Underwater""), Molko's rhymes somehow manage to be completely predictable and yet somehow totally unbelievable: the watery guitar figures that open ""Come Undone"" suggest a possible Duran Duran cover, but instead it's <i>Battle for the Sun</i>'s stab at resonance-- ""You don't know how you're coming across/ Acting like you don't give a toss/ Walking around like you're on some kind of cross/ And it's a shame on you the irony's lost."" Oh, word?</p>
<p>If the fact that I'm in my late twenties and still reviewing Placebo records doesn't make it totally obvious, I'll just come out and say it-- back in 1998, I thought <i>Without You I'm Nothing </i>was the absolute shit. Though it hit during the salad days of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", you could argue that the popularity of the <i>Twilight </i>series has made that album's combination of amateur sexual deviance and gender ambiguity somewhat timely. As such, Placebo seem to be sustaining their musical careers the same way <i>Dazed and Confused</i>'s Wooderson sustained his social career: ""That's what I love about these Placebo fans, man. I get older, they stay the same age.""</p></div>"|13162.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13162-battle-for-the-sun/|3.4|Ian Cohen

The New Zealander's last release as Bachelorette, 2008's <i>Isolation Loops,</i> was indeed a solo affair that, with its crackerjack melodies and lush, layered self-harmonies, made as much gorgeous electro-pop noise as any one-person project, but also erred on the side of solipsism. On that record, Alpers probed evergreen themes of loneliness and alienation via technology, peeling off lyrical barbs about vacant modern relationships (memorably in ""Duet Minus One"", ""I went to his house/ He offered me food/ I only accepted tea/ Because it's gluten-free"") in her aloof, robotic lisp. Her new LP, <i>My Electric Family</i>, attempts to break the self-referential loop, opening up emotionally and expanding Bachelorette's circle to include some unexpected sounds and-- perhaps more important symbolically than in fact-- other musicians.</p>
<p>Opener ""Instructions for Insomniacs"" signals this shift immediately with rhythmic, repetitive guitar strumming, Alpers' bare voice, and the unlikely strains of pedal steel. The song soon dusts itself off and climbs on the backs of a looped electronic flute figure and Alpers' multi-tracked <i>ahs</i> to a glorious crescendo. The new players' rootsy influences provide welcome texture to the project's typically synthetic mixes, but ""Insomniacs""' slow build and kaleidoscopic explosion is already something of a Bachelorette trademark. Alpers repeats the trick on the otherwise dour, sample-cobbled track two, ""The National Grid"", and later by layering keyboard lines, percussion, and finally boisterous horns, on ""Dream Sequence"". ""Her Rotating Head"" is one of several songs on the record that sweats with disco fever, nostalgic, disembodied handclaps and squiggly-line analog synths included. With her cool and kittenish alto, Alpers is a credible indie-dance diva and the song's melody is memorable enough, but what makes ""Head"" special is its final minute's critical mass of layered vocals glinting and somersaulting through space. She may fear becoming a machine, but when Alpers folds herself into the electronic process, the results are delicious, even ecstatic.</p>
<p>Alpers is so adept at intricate bedroom pop that I sort of wish she'd leave it at that, because she tends to undermine Bachelorette's power with incoherent and insincerely applied themes. <i>My Electric Family</i> is less isolationist than its predecessor, seeming to concede the possibility of human relationships and providing a glimpse into Alpers' inner life. ""Where to Begin"", for example, adeptly captures the yearning pathos of people with mostly online lives (""On the computer/ Observing strangers/ Ignoring those around you""). But she starts to muddy the waters when she dabbles in dystopia. ""Technology Boy"" asserts to dorky bleeps n' bloops that the titular character ""attempts to live his life as a machine/ But then his humanness experiences utilitarian resentment."" Sound and fury, meet nothing. ""Mercurial Man"" and ""Her Rotating Head"" also spit up silly logic-defiers and broadcast sentiments that seem ripped from a retro-futurist style manual.</p>
<p>Retro-futurism's a durable and persistent pop culture trope, currently burning up the design world on every front from mid-century modern-inspired furniture to steampunk fashion. But unmoored from original context and free-floating in the past's imaginary future, it's style, not substance. There's absolutely nothing wrong with pop music that just wants to sound sleek and sexy and goad you into singing in the shower or dancing deliriously (and some would argue that's all pop should aspire to). Bachelorette, however, seems to harbor loftier ambitions. But although Alpers has found a winning sound, she's still scrambling to gather her notes and draft a theme she can deliver with conviction.</p></div>"|13227.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13227-my-electric-family/|7.5|Amy Granzin

They've probably listened to their fair share of Replacements records and peak-period punk (a more ragged Radio Birdman comes to mind), and judging from <i>Lose Your Illusion, Too</i>, their third album, they've assimilated those things plenty well enough to do it themselves, and do it well. Hiding behind that creepy/confusing, vaguely provocative album cover is something altogether easier to digest.</p>
<p>Leading the charge is guitarist/vocalist Kevin Richard, whose gritty, strangled delivery is the automatic focal point, reinforced by his mates shouting in tandem behind him. This gives the music a visceral kick that the riffs and rhythms can't usually muster by themselves, but it also compromises some of the band's melodic ambitions-- his sandpaper rasp sometimes simply fails to define the notes. <i>Lose Your Illusion</i> isn't significantly different from the band's first two albums, but it does have a bit more pop in the songwriting, and inevitably that sharpest hooks are the ones where the backing vocals ride to the rescue, as they do on every line of ""Helpful"", a song whose clipped gait gives it a Clash-y feel.</p>
<p>""Kinda Babes"" is a good example of a song whose pop appeal is compromised by the constantly strained lead vocals-- the lighter arrangement, with just a bit of tambourine for percussion and cleanly strummed guitar, gets into a nice call-and-response between the backing vocals and the lead, but where the backing vocals hint at a fluid phrase, it never comes, and instead a bit of slide guitar mixed way back comes in to hint even further. ""Exquisite Corpse"", an attempt at a ballad, drips with catharsis but isn't half as memorable as it should be. The gravel is a lot more apt on amped-up stomper ""Chopper"", which cycles through ferocious Stooges riffs with wicked authority. ""Never Lived By Myself"" makes good use of humor in the call-and-response, with drummer Seth Bohn rhetorically asking, ""Where did all my money go? I don't know. I probably spent it all on smokes,"" and getting an unexpected answer from the band, which replies, ""Yes, probably.""</p>
<p>They save the hardest punch for last, wrapping the album up with ""(Us And) All Our Friends Are So Messed Up"", a song that morphs into a massive barroom shout-along in its final third that I imagine would be thrilling in a club with the crowd joining in. In fact, most of the album seems as though it would translate better on stage, where the sweat and volume of a club could really send it all home. As it stands, <i>Lose Your Illusion, Too</i> makes a good racket but falls a little short of making its songs stick.</p></div>"|13165.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13165-lose-your-illusion-too/|5.9|Joe Tangari

In the Dirty Projectors frontman we have a fellow who fancies himself not so much a songwriter as a modern composer, a Yale grad with one of indie rock's most divisive voices. Early DPs records carry with them ambitions so grandiose it's no wonder they range from wildly inventive to practically unlistenable-- occasionally in the span of the same song.</p>
<p>Then there was 2007's <i>Rise Above</i>, which saw Longstreth and company misremembering the hell out of Black Flag's <i>Damaged</i> by slathering embellishment onto one of the most gloriously unadorned LPs ever. It wasn't exactly a gimmick, but-- and I say this as a fan of both of those records-- it wasn't all that far from one. In spite of its comparatively light tone and the band's tight clutch on melody and rhythm, it was art-damaged and, to some, impenetrable. However you sized it up, you had to admit it was intriguing, even if your interest level waned with every passing yelp. This has heretofore been the story of Dirty Projectors: a band so brainy, so good at the very particular thing they do, they can be hard to like.</p>
<p>Now comes <i>Bitte Orca</i>, the band's best, and certainly most likable, album by a mile. <i>Bitte</i> doesn't actually switch up the <i>Rise Above</i> formula that much: Intricate (if roomier) full-band arrangements abound, Longstreth largely sticks with his clear King Sunny Ade-meets-Jimmy Page guitar acrobatics, and he's still singing his strange, loping songs with <i>that</i> voice. But it whittles down the jarring time signatures and off-kilter arrangements and vocal bleats (er, for the most part) to create a triumphant art-pop record destined to please longtime fans and win him a whole slew of new ones. The key is that, rather surprisingly, <i>Bitte Orca</i> is one of the more purely enjoyable indie-rock records in an awfully long time; remarkable by any means, but even moreso considering the source. It's breezy without a hint of slightness, tuneful but with its fair share of tumult, concise and inventive and replayable and plain old fun. It is the sound of Longstreth the composer and Longstreth the pop songwriter finally settling on a few things together after years of tug-of-war between the two.</p>
<p>There are some triumphant standalone songs in the DPs back catalogue-- ""Fucked For Life"", ""I Will Truck"", and ""Rise Above"" spring to mind-- but never has Longstreth laid nine of them out in a row, as he does on <i>Bitte Orca</i>. From the chiming opening chords of ""Cannibal Resource"" to the supple swivel that closes ""Fluorescent Half-Dome"", there's a forward motion at play when you spin <i>Bitte Orca</i> all the way through, but it's an album of such a high uniform quality and such indelible range, practically any tune could be your favorite. Songs run the gamut from <i>Zeppelin III</i>-style swirl (sorta-title-track ""Useful Chamber"") to delicate balladry (""Two Doves"", a dead ringer for Nico's cover of Jackson Browne's ""These Days"" and no less gorgeous for it) to R&amp;B bob-and-weave (""Stillness Is the Move"", which owes a great debt to the dearly departed Aaliyah-Timbaland braintrust) to adult-contemporary pop (no shots, ""No Intention""). Apart from the ultimately transitional whoosh of the brief ""The Bride"", the run from ""Cannibal Resource"" to ""No Intention"" is as solid and variegated a display of songwriting acumen and instrumental virtuosity as any you'll hear this year. But it sure doesn't feel as heavy as that sentence might have you believe.</p>
<p>I don't dare pick one highlight-- hell, my favorites keep changing-- but I'll point to ""Useful Chamber"" as the best encapsulation of what <i>Bitte Orca</i> does so well. A woozy synth line underpins one of Longstreth's gentlest vocal performances to date, a melody line I find myself singing in all sorts of inopportune places. Roughly halfway through, the beat breaks, Longstreth half-raps a little pre-chorus pep talk, and the song explodes in sound and vision. I don't quite understand what Longstreth is going for with the song's whale-plea mantra, but when it sounds like this-- so gigantic, so effortless, so unbelievably catchy-- I could really give a fuck. It's pure bliss, tension that results in glorious release. And while the song-- like the album it features on-- sacrifices precious little of the art-pop leanings of Longstreth's past work, he's traded obfuscation for overtness on nearly all levels, channeled his frenetic energy into paring down the songwriting as opposed to putting it all into the performances, and the results positively sing.</p>
<p>I'm only slightly less enamored of <i>Bitte Orca</i>'s final twofer than I am with what precedes it, though either would be a clear highlight on any of the other DPs albums. ""Remade Horizon"" starts a bit slow and Longstreth's voice seems a tad strained on the verse melody; despite an ebullient shoutalong chorus, it seems more an excuse for the impressive feat of vocal pummelhorsery from Amber Coffman and Angel Deradoorian in its second half than it does a tune's tune like the seven that come before it. It's the first time on <i>Bitte Orca</i> Longstreth allows chops to stand out in front of the song, and while it's neat to hear them pull it off (and is an absolute marvel in a live setting), it feels showy in a way <i>Bitte Orca</i> otherwise avoids in favor of direct hits. The emphasis on Coffman and Deradoorian's vocals throughout is one of the best things about the record; ""Horizon"" just happens to be the one moment they seem overused-- a problem of arrangement, really-- and it suffers a bit for it.</p>
<p>""Fluorescent Half Dome"" has the opposite problem; it's a bit too simplistic getting going and doesn't quite earn its bizarre chorus. While, like most songs here, it picks up when Coffman and Deradoorian start in with their vocals, it's not quite the closer a record like this deserves. But even focusing on relative difficulty among tracks on the record seems odd: Jaw-dropping virtuosity was the best thing the DPs had going for them prior to<i> Bitte Orca. </i>Here, it stands behind so many other newly apparent strengths-- a testament to the leaps and bounds Longstreth has made as a songsmith and Dirty Projectors have made as a band.</p></div>"|13159.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13159-bitte-orca/|9.2|Paul Thompson

Get Me Out of Here!"" is an international franchise, and ""Shark Week"" programming is among our most-watched TV documentaries, it's hard to imagine that proto-documentarian Robert Flaherty was once considered a game-changer. Flaherty's career as an explorer, filmmaker, and armchair anthropologist had long solidified by 1934, when his third film, <i>Man of Aran,</i> stood as the grandest example yet of what had become his trademark style, beginning with 1922's <i>Nanook of the North</i>: traveling to inhospitable regions of the world (in this case, the rocky, sea-scarred Aran islands off the western coast of Ireland) and getting natives to recreate their cultural habits for a worldwide audience of filmgoers eager for safe glimpses of unseen corners of the world. As a filmmaker, Flaherty both solidified much of what we now know as documentary language, and, strangely enough, predicted one of the form's most popular-- and despised-- grandchildren, reality television.</p>
<p>Or, maybe reality television is just an incredibly regressive story form. Either way, it's exactly this strange admixture of the modern and postmodern that makes any of Flaherty's works evergreen and ripe for reinterpretation. Ostentatious, self-serious revisionism has been one of British Sea Power's fortes ever since they packaged their 2003 debut album as a ""Classic"" work of history, so it's easy to see why, 75 years later, they'd be up to the unique task of redoing the score for <i>Aran</i>. <i>The Quietus</i> wonderfully explained the unique collusion between narrative and time, calling it ""a 21st century attempt to complement a 20th century film about an often 19th century way of life.""</p>
<p>It becomes quickly clear that, while their interpretation is sympathetic to the original, BSP are meeting Flaherty on their own terms. The band repurposed three of its own moody, atmospheric numbers for inclusion in the score (""North Hanging Rock"", ""True Adventures"", and ""The Great Skua""), winkingly name the last piece ""No Man Is an Archipelago"", and has been brazen enough in the liner notes to regard <i>Aran</i>, which Flaherty intended originally to be a noble man vs. sea tale of survival against the elements, as ""at once heroic, stunning, camp, ridiculous... everything a rock band should be."" Though Flaherty has been roundly (and often rightly) criticized for romanticizing his subjects as isolated, noble primitives, in this context one of his most notoriously ballsy quotes is innocent enough to unironically headline the liners: ""I should have been shot for what I asked these superb people to do, all for the sake of a keg of porter and five pounds a piece.""</p>
<p>It doesn't rise to the level of firing squad, but the band's cover of ""Come Wander With Me"", a 1964 Jeff Alexander number originally included in a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7RnqBchvTU"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>""Twilight Zone"" episode</b></a>, is the starkest example of the band's own form of poetic license. The song's lyrics are mundane romantic escapism, standing in stark counterpoint to the scene they butt heads with: a family scours its barren home for seaweed and returns home with their catch strapped to horses, walking waist-deep in water. They'll ""wander"" later, thanks. Part of the mystery of BSP's score, indeed, is trying to parse if the band's actively playing with the touristic gaze that Flaherty was immune to, or if they're just ignoring it. Either way, it's sort of eerie.</p>
<p>When the score and visuals work together, though, the effect can be stunning. As the men return from an expedition in a small canoe, the opening ""The South Sound"" sequence flows forward from a nervous first movement of minor key piano and dark cello into a tumultuous post-rock freakout, as the family is thrown against the rocks by the sea's raging waves, trying to bring ashore the day's catch.  Later, the ""Boy Vertiginous""/""Spearing the Sunfish"" section is the best-- both through Flaherty's virtuosic filmmaking and BSP nailing the dramatic tension. The sequence crosscuts between a young boy catching a fish with a rock tied to a string and a group of men showing how adults do it-- killing a shark with a spear, from a tiny fishing boat. As Flaherty cuts to a shot of the grizzled hunters cresting a hill, BSP swell to a crescendo straight out of Hollywood, and it's the most goosebump-inducing moment in the film. The sequence doesn't let up for several minutes, either-- even as a recreation, it took two days to get the shark back to shore-- and when the men are struggling with the shark, Flaherty's rapid cutting works perfectly with BSP's rocking the fuck out.</p>
<p>An important thing to keep in mind when watching <i>Aran</i> is that British Sea Power were most likely not willing (or able) to alter the original film in any way, and this tether often works to their disadvantage. For his part, Flaherty was working several decades before video killed the radio star, and the band doesn't work too hard to meet his 1930s style halfway. There are a more than a few times, then, when BSP's attempts to build dramatic tension feel out of sync with Flaherty's pacing and technique. Right in the middle of ""Sunfish"", for instance, a title card pops up-- Flaherty informing us how dangerous the shark is-- while the cacophonous music continues with conspicuous indifference. The last third of the film contains some of its most stunning visuals, but BSP's score plays as nostalgic what Flaherty seemed to intend as anxious. Will the father, away on another mission during a storm, return home safe? Let's take a reflective walk along the coast and think about it.</p>
<p>But this is the trick, it seems: The real power of the visual/musical connection between Flaherty and BSP comes if you regard it not as a traditional film, but as a music video. In other words, you have to let the music drive the visual, instead of vice-versa.  It's still not a transcendent translation-- 75 years might as well be a thousand in popular-culture time-- and I would still highly recommend screening the original film (might it have been nice to include the original score and ambient sound as a separate track?). The shift in perspective necessary to ""get"" it, though, does work on that level: at the least, it's a fitting testimonial to British Sea Power's partially effective relocation of a classic film into a modern aesthetic scheme.</p></div>"|13160.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13160-man-of-aran/|6.7|Eric Harvey

The group's first album in eight years, <i>Absu</i>, is an energizing sprint through black metal, bedrock thrash, symphonic flourishes, and arcane mythological references. All told, it's so intense that, by cool down, you might still be contemplating the first verse of that warm-up.</p>
<p>Indeed, layers of density define the record-- in sonics, in lyrics, in the completely triumphant, surprisingly melodic manner in which it merges the two. But first thing's first: <i>Absu</i> sounds perfect and immense, its cleanly recorded and carefully mixed presentation revealing the intricacy of Absu's ideas and the power of their musicianship. During ""Nunbarshegunu"", singer and drummer Proscriptor's percussion climaxes early before stretching his slowdown over a full minute, eventually settling into a mid-tempo trot. Bolstered by <i>Absu</i>'s sleek sense of production, each hit sounds like an explosion. Multi-instrumentalists Zawicizuz and Aethyris-- making their debuts with Absu here-- offer similar élan and adventure.</p>
<p>Then there's the question of what Proscriptor is actually screaming, singing, and growling over the music. Last month, he described the album's content to Pitchfork's Brandon Stosuy as a mix of ""Sumerian mythology, Mesopotamian cosmology, Goetia, numerology, and antiquated necromancy."" In simpler terms, a post-script in the liner notes reads, ""Absu arrogantly executes mythological occult metal... still."" Essentially, Proscriptor welds together some of the oldest, if least-known, belief systems in the world, connecting them through parables and narratives that share a unifying desire for absolute power. ""Nunbarshegunu"", for instance, recalls a classic tale of Sumerian mythology in which one god rapes his potential bride, begetting Sin. Two tracks later, Proscriptor offers a doxology for Goetia, a sort of sorcery where the relationship of shapes and numbers connects one to extra-human powers.</p>
<p>The aim, then, isn't alien to that of many metal lineages, from Viking lore to Satanic advocacy. But the devices themselves represent a clear deviation from the hegemony of most black metal. Proscriptor does more than drop names he's seen in books or on Wikipedia. He combines figures and tales, mixing the narratives and merging the belief systems to argue for chaos in the place of common sense or wisdom. You could spend the rest of the year exploring the ideas and jargon here (Seriously: scimitars, mages, Ninik, afreets, cantrips, Nisir, planets colliding, veils, ""combustion is ascendancy""), and this simple conclusion would likely remain: Proscriptor has a problem with power, but he needs more of it.</p>
<p>Of course, the first two factors wouldn't matter if Absu couldn't combine them into songs that compel and an album that coheres. They execute both rather brilliantly. Anyone can play heavy and scream obscure occult references, after all, but I'm suggesting a major corporate commission. There are big hooks on <i>Absu</i>, from the half-time stomp of the chorus in ""Amy"" to the infectious little bit about astral planes and Elder Ones during ""...Of the Dead Who Never Rest in Their Tombs Are the Attendance of Familiar Spirits..."" Speaking of that tune and being restless, Absu never sit still. ""Dead"" is a seven-minute epic in three parts, morphing from a relentless blast of black metal to a psychedelic synthesizer solo to a sinister farewell of strings and noise. Some songs have three choruses. Some have none.</p>
<p>The action comes in sustained waves, and each time it feels as if <i>Absu</i>'s energy has peaked, the trio ratchets the intensity higher still. Four minutes into ""Ye Uttuku Spells"", for instance, Proscriptor bellows ""Ye Absu rage"" above a steady holding pattern. The proclamation is laughable in its redundancy, as Absu have done nothing if not rage for the prior 50 minutes. The last words of the album's last verse, they suggest a captain finally cracking as he leads his men into one last battle. And sure enough, Absu unleash behind Proscriptor's request, a piercing guitar solo peeling from the double-bass drum gallop and the tide of distortion in the middle. It's a perfect last stand, and an unabashedly arrogant close to an album that deserves nothing less.</p></div>"|13044.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13044-absu/|8.2|Grayson Currin

She's very busy, to say the least. Owens is signed to the venerable leftfield/experimental label Kranky for her long players, but for <i>False Face Society</i>, a more off-the-cuff and improvisational piece than her past two solo projects, she's hanging with vinyl- and digital-only boutique imprint Mexican Summer.</p>
<p>Since <i>False Face Society</i>'s release is limited to just 500 physical units, only diehard fans will score a copy on wax, but of course, the internet will find the record a wider audience than that. For those who discovered Valet through her drugged-out 2008 drone exploration, <i>Naked Acid--</i> a highly accomplished, underrated album-- this three-song suite might be harder to swallow. While far from a pop record, <i>Naked Acid</i> found Valet increasingly comfortable with structure; she was more willing to ground her ambient-and-noise journeys within the confines of quote-unquote songs, and in that sense it felt like a step forward. For this EP, though, Valet returns to the sparser candlelit psych hymns of her first full-length, <i>Blood Is Clean</i>.</p>
<p>To some, it will feel like backpedaling, but I would caution against reading too much into a release like this. Less an investigation into new territory, <i>False Face Society</i> seems more like a brief pit stop, a temporary release valve for a busy creative mind. Still, the three songs included here aren't Valet's finest work to date. The first of two original pieces is ""Angels Can't Stop"", a mostly instrumental slow builder with a composed-on-the-fly quality about it. Slowed-heartbeat pulses and distant wooden percussion play next to Owens' far-off vocals, which are purposefully indecipherable here. Moving in a few distinct phases, the track's several moods bleed into one another gracefully, but at 15-plus minutes it meanders more than necessary. And with its treated vocals and guttural synths, the drone-y ""Dealer vs. Ocean"" is colder and more mechanical than we're used to from Owens; it doesn't quite reach the trippy transcendence of her previous work.</p>
<p>But even if the record's first two cuts seem sort of half-formed, fans will no doubt be excited for its final number, a dazzling impressionistic cover of Boris and Michiho Kurihara's ""Rainbow"" from 2006. This is, of course, the sort of cross-continental musical pollination between esteemed artists that us geeks go apeshit over, and luckily the song delivers. Riding the same elliptical guitar pattern as the original, ""Rainbow"" starts and ends with a whisper, but lets its drum circle pitter-patter and echoed harmonies find a dreamy equilibrium in the center. Even if ""Rainbow"" is worth the price of admission alone, <i>False Face Society</i> is certainly missing some of the components that made <i>Naked Acid</i> and <i>Blood Is Clean</i>, to a slightly lesser degree, great. (A focus on Owens' ethereal singing, the sort of Black Dice-esque atonal adventurousness of tracks such as ""Fire"", to name a few.) But, again, we're talking about just three tracks (not enough to really guess at Valet's trajectory from here), so there's little reason to doubt that she has more great music in her.</p></div>"|13145.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13145-false-face-society/|5.8|Joe Colly

But, just like his work with the old band, sweetness-with-bite wouldn't be the worst way to describe <i>Clangour</i>, Sigfússon's debut under his new name. Sure enough, the soothing sensibility of Seabear-- indie-rocking but peaceful, even a bit twee-- lives on in Sin Fang Bous. But here it gains teeth, so to speak. Leaving behind the predictable comforts of his group work, Sigfússon suffuses his new project with little anxieties and mysteries that have the power to surprise.</p>
<p>If you watch <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/tv/#/musicvideo/3599-sin-fang-bous-advent-in-ives-garden-morr"" target=""_blank"">the video</a> for ""Advent in Ives Garden"", a playfully literal translation of the lyrics, each verse given clumsily animated life, you'll find that its harlequin color, surreal sights, and crooked lines mimic the naive experimentalism of outsider art. Beyond this one song, the video's aesthetic captures the twisted-fairytale aura and the alluring looseness, of both concept and composition, that marks the entire record. You can find these elements on ""Catch the Light"" and ""Clangour and Flutes"", two shabbily uptempo numbers that lean heavily on a 4/4 thump; both go for an acoustic, even rural simplicity with their piano arpeggios, or shimmering tambourines, or solitary flute. That steady digital pulse adds a surprising dimension to the otherwise analog activity in the foreground: on ""We Belong"", it offers an emotional anchor for the soaring Paw Tracks-style flights of fancy that isn't there on, for one, the skittering and thoroughly processed ""A Fire to Sleep In"".</p>
<p>Layering works for Sigfússon, partly because you can't always guess what he will stack next, or when. The path of each song can fork without warning. ""Fafafa"", a mosaic of chopped-up, mealymouthed vocals seems to be going nowhere, before this prelude suddenly burgeons into a miniature orchestra, Xeroxing his own voice over itself, but also fastening together piano and organ, and installing it all above a humble rhythm of rattling, twanging percussion. The gorgeous farewell track, ""Lies"", startles the listener with its sheer hymnlike austerity. The crescendo never comes: the train-like percussion never explodes into a frenzy of drums, its faraway vocals never swell into a yell. Instead, Sigfússon moans plaintively over the glittering cascade of piano samples, and the momentum really never flags.</p>
<p>Equally surprising are the deviations of genre. Apparently an apple amid oranges, ""Melt Down the Knives"" exhausts its dark, <i>Nuggets</i>-via-post-punk energy in two minutes flat. It seems out of place on the record, when you set its macho bombardment of guitars and its air of pessimism against the other tracks. But when you place it beside ""Sunken Ship"", swollen with the baroque machinery of <i>Sgt. Pepper's</i> psychedelia, it illuminates the sources behind Sin Fang Bous's kitchen-sink adventures: the 1960s. It's not unreasonable, in fact, to sense a Spectorian wall of sound in the percussive boom and splash of ""Carry Me Up to Smell Pine"". With an imagination thoroughly sculpted by the past, Sigfússon's cut-and-paste folk manages effortlessly to evoke both the psychedelic rockers of yesteryear and more recent enchanters like Stuart Murdoch and Panda Bear.</p></div>"|12889.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12889-clangour/|6.9|Roque Strew

Its strengths and weaknesses are all upfront-- in fact they're pretty well encapsulated in the first two tracks. Opener ""Sacred Trickster"" is a quick, adrenalized rocker in the vein of 2006's similarly straightforward <i>Rather Ripped</i>. Slamming to a stop after a tight two minutes, the band then tears into ""Anti-Orgasm"", exploding into biting noise halfway through before the song eventually drifts into beatific, instrumental wandering. It's a familiar move that Sonic Youth have deployed to strong effect many times (try ""Pacific Coast Highway"" on 1987's <i>Sister </i>or ""Rain on Tin"" on 2002's <i>""Murray Stree</i>t for starters). But here it seems to come too soon-- an auto-pilot turn that rings a bit off-key.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>The Eternal</i> runs through similar cycles of ebb and flow. And while the flow outweighs the ebb, it doesn't always defeat it. Many of the band's signature styles are well-timed: the concise blasts from guitarists Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo during the bridge of ""Calming the Snake"", the slow-building denouement of ""Walkin Blue"", the acoustic flourishes that give closer ""Massage the History"" a chilly mood. But sometimes the go-to moves feel forced-- take Moore's stiff rant on ""Thunderclap (For Bobby Pyn)"", or the dead-end bridge of ""Leaky Lifeboat (For Gregory Corso)"". The best Sonic Youth albums cohere enough to withstand missteps--sometimes even make virtues out of them-- but here the stutter-steps stick out a bit, putting <i>The Eternal</i> on a middle rung of Sonic Youth's discographical ladder.</p>
<p>Which still means it's pretty damn good. There's no denying the vitality of songs like ""Antenna"", a Moore sing-the-guitar-line classic akin to <i>A Thousand Leaves</i>' ""Sunday"" or <i>Murray Street</i>'s ""The Empty Page"". ""Radios play nothing when she's far away/ TV antenna rusts and gone to waste,"" Moore contemplates, his voice decaying along with his chiming strings. Just as good are two Ranaldo songs, the aforementioned ""Walkin Blue""-- a swaying rocker with Beat poet-influenced couplets-- and ""What We Know"", sort of an elongated update on <i>Rather Ripped</i>'s ""Rats"". ""Heaven's not about your reputation,"" he sings, musing about ""stepping across the great divide."" Like much of <i>The Eternal</i>, ""What We Know"" seems fixated on death, loss, and what little can be known about either.</p>
<p>High points like that might hit harder without some surrounding lags, like the ZZ-Top-on-downers ""Poison Arrow"", or the weary yeah-yeah's of ""Thunderclap (for Bobby Pyn)""-- especially since each of those tunes is followed by a similar, much better track. The chugging guitars of ""Malibu Gas Station"" trump ""Poison Arrow"" with sped-up, Television-like twin-guitar, while the wiry energy of ""No Way"", with its Ramones-ish chorus (""I'm not talking to you no more,"" chants Moore), echoes classic punk better than ""Thunderclap"".</p>
<p>But then it's easy to nitpick with a group that has been this good for this long and always offers a lot to comb through and dissect. Besides, <i>The Eternal</i> could turn out to be a grower. It certainly has happened before with Sonic Youth, whose unique place in rock history-- as a kind of living glue between late-70s post-punk and 90s alternative, 80s DIY indie and 00s net-age, tight pop and improvised noise, hard punk and hippie jams, etc.-- is secure, no matter what time reveals about individual albums. At the very least, some excellent songs lurk among these 12 tracks, and there's enough potential for debate about which are which to make <i>The Eternal</i> worthy of Sonic Youth's singular canon.</p></div>"|13153.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13153-the-eternal/|6.8|Marc Masters

I realize that trying to play the sympathy card is pretty futile when that cover is staring back at you, but Kasabian have seemed like the sort of group whose punishment has been disproportionate to their musical crimes. Sure, Americans have become conditioned to cast a wary eye towards the vast majority of NME-hyped bands from across the pond, and the UK pubs seem to hype them simply for their ability to evoke a chemically altered 90s nostalgia-- you know, the kind of stuff that never happens here...<br/><br/>Trying to hold Kasabian to the standards, or at least the sensibilities, of our more recent indie faves is like wondering why beer commercials never license, I dunno, Sunn O))). As it is, <i>West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum</i> can be pretty enjoyable when operating from its position of strength, completely from the neck down. If you just can't get enough distorted bass, then by the time ""Fast Fuse"" comes hurtling down the pike, you might be ready to toss this in your top 10. Or you might like it about as much as the Music's last record. Either way, there's almost a hip-hop approach to Kasabian's better songs here-- as long as those hydraulic riffs take up as much space as the chunky breakbeats, nearly anything sounds good over it. Which really helps when you're dealing with a guy like Tom Meighan, whose lyricism can be most kindly described as ""an afterthought."" Songs called ""Underdog"" and ""Where Did All the Love Go?"" both manage to slip in references to bar fighting, and the latter implores the listener to steal a hobo's wine. I would joke about how this stuff will never go out of style as long as EA keeps making soccer games, but ""Fast Fuse"" actually is on ""FIFA 09"".<br/><br/>When taking advantage of the opportunity to be as dumb as they need/want to be, West Ryder succeeds, which is another way of saying acoustic guitars have absolutely no reason to be involved. Okay, maybe that's going a bit overboard; after all, even XTRMNTR had slow songs on it. Thing is, those songs were actually slow and provided something resembling contrast, but Meighan attacks with the same cant throughout. During West Ryder's incomprehensibly misguided midsection and final quarter, Kasabian lumber through a rash of poky Kinks pastiches as if the Kooks don't already have a monopoly on that front, and Meighan's inability to show range trickles down to the rest of the group.<br/><br/>As long as retro-obsessed bands make third albums, you're going to have the use of Panda Express-authentic touches of Oriental drone (""Take Aim""). As long as Screamadelica is considered a (rightful) classic, you're going to get lesser attempts at ""I'm Comin' Down"", and here they're called ""Ladies &amp; Gentlemen (Roll the Dice)"", ""Fire"", and ""Happiness"". And as long as bands have the ability to do stuff like this, they'll get someone like Rosario Dawson for a misguided and interminably long Bonnie &amp; Clyde roleplay (""West Ryder Silver Bullet""). These are all things hundreds of bands do far better than Kasabian, still stuck in a somewhat uncomfortable position of being very good at a style of electro-based rock that's considered pretty unfashionable, right or wrong.</p></div>"|13154.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13154-west-ryder-pauper-lunatic-asylum/|4.9|Ian Cohen

The resurrected indie-pop imprint is of course responsible for one of this year's breakout acts, the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, among other like-minded bands. Liechtenstein represent another entry in Slumberland's current renewal of mid-to-late-1980s American and British indie, but instead of drawing influence from Black Tambourine or early My Bloody Valentine, the all-female group is recreating a very specific strain of guitar-pop also from that era. That music-- woman-fronted new wave bands like Dolly Mixture and the burgeoning twee of Heavenly Records-- is lovingly Xeroxed for a new generation on Liechtenstein's debut album, <i>Survival Strategies In a Modern World</i>.</p>
<p>It's a tricky way to get noticed as a new band. Such overt revivalism-- the group's MySpace page announces it ""sounds like: 1984""-- is usually criticized for lack of ambition, which is fair. The same can (and will) be said of Liechtenstein, but their 2009 version of this style is convincing enough possibly to evade such judgments. At the very least, they've nailed the sound. With its tight, intermingling vocal harmonies and crisp instrumentation, <i>Survival Strategies</i>' crystalline pop apes bands whose influence lives on through just a handful of singles. About a third of the record is built upon Dolly Mixture's caffeinated, melodic new wave; the remaining two-thirds is split between Talulah Gosh's blatantly cutesy twee and the jittery post-punk of Girls at Our Best! None of it is truly theirs. But here's the thing: it all sounds pretty good.</p>
<p>That's crucial, since even a few sub-par numbers on an album this short (nine songs at under 23 minutes) can do serious damage. Opener ""All at Once"" is probably the track most primed for a breakout here and is a good example of Liechtenstein's approach. Over a dimly-lit backdrop of gloomy guitars and drum beats, the women's voices bleed into one another-- verse becoming chorus and vice-versa-- in such a way that finds extreme catchiness without becoming cloying. Similarly sticky ""Postcard"" and ""By Staying Here (We Will Slowly Disappear)"" reveal the group's more heart-on-sleeve twee side. Lovey-dovey and upbeat, ""Postcard"" is suburban in its charms (""Don't leave the cat on its own, don't leave the lights on when you go,"" they sing), while the latter takes a darkly comedic stab at the desire to leave one's hometown, that classic pop sentiment. ""Chances are we will never make it far,"" they concede in a Morrissey/Stuart Murdoch kind of moment.</p>
<p>But on a record like this one, it's hard to say if just having good songs is enough. One almost needs an appreciation for the music Liechtenstein is looking to restore in order to enjoy the album. And though the band does a fine job of balancing its very poppy poppiness with darker textures, the sugary qualities so present throughout can become overwhelming. (The band almost admits as much on final track ""The End"", where they eventually jettison effervescent guitar pop in favor of a lovely acoustic ballad.) But because its aim is so specific and backward-looking, <i>Survival Strategies</i> seems destined to be the sort of record that gets lost in the shuffle, enjoyed briefly then set aside. It might serve as a real treat for devout fans of its niche or a point of entry for those unfamiliar, but in order to really stand on its own, an album needs to do more than that.</p></div>"|13144.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13144-survival-strategies-in-a-modern-world/|6.7|Joe Colly

In an environment when five new single-artist mixtapes come out every day, it didn't really work. But any random 10 songs from the Month of Madness would've made for a better album than <i>Philadelphia Freeway 2</i>, Free's inexplicable dud of a third album.</p>
<p>To put things bluntly, <i>PF2</i> is the kind of album where rappers give interviews telling people not to buy it after it comes out. It's barely an album, really. At 40 minutes, its eight songs come weighed down with skits and prolonged instrumental outros and a remix that adds nothing but a quick (albeit great) Sheek Louch verse to a track we'd already heard. <i>And</i> that track is the one where Free talks about getting your baby's mother's gums all cummy (her response: ""yummy yummy""), which we really didn't need to hear twice. Honestly, this album's mere existence is a puzzle. Free's never been a marquee name, but his two previous albums came with thick, expansive production and A-list guests. Both of them carried the all-important Jay-Z co-sign. And if 2007's <i>Free at Last</i> wasn't the event that his debut was, it still resonated as a truly solid under-the-radar major-label album.</p>
<p>As for <i>PF2</i>, it finds Free off Roc-A-Fella. The beats are like K-Mart versions of the swollen soul loops that Just Blaze contributed to the first <i>Philadelphia Freeway</i>. The only guest is Sheek, a problem for a rapper who's always shined playing his strained, urgent delivery off of his calmer, cooler guests. The one thing that comes close to saving <i>Philadelphia Freeway 2 </i>is<i> </i>Freeway himself. He's an incredible rapper. He killed himself animating those great Just Blaze beats, and he kills himself just as hard here. He spits almost every line like it's the last thing anyone will ever hear from him, and he pushes his voice in unexpected new directions even when he has to know nobody is paying attention. It's weirdly inspirational, hearing Free do some incredible work on tracks that could just never be worthy of him. He's like the guy who busts his ass at a minimum-wage go-nowhere job even though he knows he won't earn himself any extra money doing it. It's like he just wants to do a good job.</p>
<p>On ""Murda Muzic"", he snarls, ""When I let out a buckshot, you shit-out-of-luck,"" hardening every syllable and turning his delivery into a barreling stutter. On ""Around the World"", he says, ""Your motherfucking aunt run neighborhood watch,"" like it's a withering insult. On ""Streets Won't Miss'em"", he animates a tired kill-snitches concept through sheer demented attention to detail: ""You shoulda did it like a soldier do it/ Now we dousing you with motor fluid."" (He also calls a rat ""Young Fievel"", which is just funny.) And on ""Crack Rap"", he talks about seeing crack addiction slowly break down his uncle, then tells a story about the man begging him for the drug. That scene ends without resolution, Free's uncle finally telling him, ""Tell your mama be over at the house later today to fix the cable box,"" the sort of mundane little touch that drives a heartbreaking story home that much harder.</p>
<p>Plenty of rappers these days are working the intersection between sneery tough-talk and soul-bearing confessions; almost none of them are doing it better than Freeway. Free is a furious talent, and it's sad to see him relegated to this weird little nothing of an album. But <i>Philadelphia Freeway 2</i> is a detour, not an ending. Later this year, Free will decamp to Rhymesayers to release <i>The Stimulus Package</i>, his collaborative album with the great Seattle producer Jake One. This marks Free as the latest once-semi-popular rapper to defect to the welcoming arms of the indie-rap underground. It's always weird seeing that happen to people who showed up on Faith Evans singles not that long ago, but in Free's case, it can't come soon enough. On Rhymesayers, he'll be free of commercial pressure, and he'll get to crank out hard, uncompromising soul jams for people who actually want to hear them. That's a good place for him. Besides, the new songs he did with Jake One at SXSW musically obliterate anything on <i>Philadelphia Freeway 2</i>.</p></div>"|13190.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13190-philadelphia-freeway-2/|4.7|Tom Breihan

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Could be that <i>Blinking Lights and Other Revelations </i>was something of a career ender.<span> </span>This isn't to be confused with a career <i>killer</i>; on the contrary, <i>Blinking Lights </i>was the best Eels record since 1998's <i>Electro-Shock Blues</i>.<span> </span>But it's a record that would be tough to top if only because it felt unnecessary to follow up, serving as a comprehensive Guide to All Things Eels, E's lyrical and musical themes attacked from every angle. At second glance though, <i>Blinking </i><i>Lights</i>' consistency was borne out of similarity.<span> I</span>t's incredibly easy to write an Eels song these days: pick a descending chord progression, force some rhymes on the title, and you're on your way.<span> </span>Perhaps you'll be more excited about making an Eels record than E seems here, as he scribbles through the <i>12 Songs of Desire </i>like they were moderately difficult crosswords. <span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">From what I could tell, <i>Hombre Lobo </i>wasn't supposed to end up that way.<span> </span>Considering the title, it<i> </i>set out to tap into man's more primal needs, but emotionally and musically, E's pretty much been going it alone since the jump. Opener<span> </span>""Prizefighter"" initially recalls <i>Souljacker</i>'s hairy-knuckle-dragging ""Dogfaced Boy"", the song that ushered in Everett's Unabomber look and undisputedly his weakest stretch of music. In between blues explosion howling, it gives you headslap titular rhymes like ""go all-nighter"" and ""don't do it wrong, do-it-righter.<span>"" </span>And while ""Tremendous Dynamite"" and ""What's a Fella Gotta Do"" sorta rock, they rock pretty hard for <i>Eels songs</i>, but I can't imagine that <i>Hombre Lobo </i>is going to be anyone's primary source for hot riffs, not when E is still deadpanning his way through lyrics like, ""You really know what makes me sad/ Your disinterest is driving me mad,"" and, ""I'm so tired of the same old crud/ My sweet baby, I need fresh blood.<span>"" </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The tracks on <i>Hombre Lobo </i>that aren't juke-joint pastiche sink into Everett's comfort zone of impotent longing, the trouble with dreams, and the general shittiness of putting your faith in other people.<span> A</span>s someone who's been following him for damn near a decade and a half, there's still enough suction in Everett's seemingly bottomless vortex of self-pity.<span> </span>Like most of E's best songs, ""The Look You Give That Guy"" turns an unrequited crush into an intense self-loathing-- the key isn't that the object of his desire would be better off with him, but his simple wish that ""if I were that guy instead of me, I'd never let you down.<span>"" </span>But I wonder if the success of ""The Look"" is more due to its sequencing, since similarly themed and composed tracks down the line such as ""The Longing"" and ""In My Dreams"" fail to deliver any sort of lasting effect, ultimately coming off like E could spend the rest of his life writing variations of ""Ugly Love"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But while it's somewhat hopeless to think E could write about something other than hopelessness, <i>Hombre </i>continues his misguided decision to let his lyrics take the forefront over frail and unencumbered arrangements. ""Beginner's Luck"" and ""Fresh Blood"" both approach R&amp;B cautiously, the former copping a bouncy Motown vibe while the latter <i>almost </i>recalls the heavily sampled ""Message From a Black Man"". Yet each is treated with the same dry, flat band-in-a-box recording that, once again, reminds me how long it's been since I've listened to <i>Chocolate and Cheese.</i><span> </span><span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">It would be too easy to dog <i>Hombre Lobo </i>as a case where going back to the well leads to diminishing returns, but the problem is just that <i>Hombre Lobo </i>is <i>too easy</i>.<span> </span>For all the emotional polarity E hopes to convey, too much of <i>Hombre </i>sports the facility of a jingle-- the contours of the lyrics and music so predetermined that Everett could just as easily be singing about free credit reports.<span> </span>Granted, E's arguably catering only to people who were stuck off the realness of <i>Electro-Shock Blues </i>to the point where they managed to get to <i>Blinking Lights</i>, but as an intermittently proud member of that group, I'll admit that <i>Hombre Lobo </i>feels like an appendix to a predecessor that hardly needed more of the same.</p></div>"|13087.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13087-hombre-lobo-12-songs-of-desire/|4.6|Ian Cohen

He speaks his mind-- directly, clearly, possibly loudly, and thankfully often. Among his most frequent targets is hypocrisy, which he's often seen in the posturing of artists performing high-profile charitable acts. Hell, his quips about the toothlessness and pointlessness of Live 8 are arguably the most entertaining things he's produced this decade. To wit (no pun): ""Correct me if I'm wrong, but are [Live 8] hoping that one of these guys from the G8 is on a quick 15-minute break at Gleneagles [Scotland] and sees Annie Lennox singing 'Sweet Dreams' and thinks, 'Fuck me, she might have a point there.'""</p>
<p>Gallagher has, of course, done charity work himself, pitching in to benefit the Teenage Cancer Trust (and Pablove Foundation, which benefits the cancer-stricken son of Dangerbird Records' Jeff Castelaz), Street Child Africa, Tibetan Freedom, and of course War Child. It was Oasis' contribution to War Child's 1995 <i>Help!</i> album-- a slowed, Johnny Depp-assisted version of B-side ""Fade Away""-- that gives Gallagher's latest charitable effort its name. <i>Dreams We Have as Children</i> is a collection of songs recorded at London's Royal Albert Hall in March 2007 at a show again to benefit the Teenage Cancer Trust.</p>
<p>Bootlegs of most of the show's 16 songs have been around for a while, but in recent months iTunes has begun selling the full set to benefit the TCT. Joined on two songs by Paul Weller and throughout the set by fellow Oasis guitarist Gem Archer, it's not a strictly solo show, but it is primarily acoustic, inviting comparisons to Oasis' notorious 1995 ""MTV Unplugged"" set, where the elder Gallagher had to pinch-hit for his supposedly ill younger brother, Liam. The Oasis frontman watched the performance from a balcony while smoking and drinking as Noel soldiered on, earning a wellspring of respect in the process and helping to dispel the notions that both of the oft-quarreling siblings were unprofessional.</p>
<p><i>Dreams</i> also recalls that set in another way-- of the 13 Oasis songs here, 11 date from 1994-95, by far the most artistically fruitful years in the band's history. (The two exceptions are ""Don't Go Away"", from 1997's <i>Be Here Now</i>, and ""The Importance of Being Idle"", from 2005's <i>Don't Believe the Truth</i>.) The requisite big songs are mostly here-- ""Wonderwall"", ""Don't Look Back in Anger"", ""Slide Away"", three of Oasis' best-- but, intriguingly, other than those, ""Cast No Shadow"", and ""Married With Children"", the set features six songs originally recorded as either B-sides or LP bonus tracks, making the night a treat for diehard fans and giving a larger variety of would-be buyers reasons to check out the record.</p>
<p>Of the B-sides, the deeper into Oasis' catalogue they go, the more of a mixed bag they are here. ""Listen Up"", when stripped of its shoegaze-biting sheen, holds up better than expected, thanks in part to Noel's more varied line readings compared to his brother's bluster. Opener ""(It's Good) To Be Free"", one of Oasis' weaker 94-95 efforts to start, is a slog here as well.</p>
<p>The song that follows, ""Talk Tonight"", shouldn't have picked things up either. One of the band's more poignant tracks, it was originally recorded as a solo acoustic effort by an audibly exhausted and frustrated Noel. Estranged from the group and considering disbanding it, it's arguably his most human performance and a reason why its parent EP, <i>Some Might Say</i>, is his band's most compelling, top to bottom. Taken out of that context, the song still holds up nicely. As does ""Half the World Away"", made famous in the UK as the theme song to ""The Royle Family"" and here turned into an audience sing-along, and ""Fade Away"", the song which gives the LP its title and still one of Oasis' high points.</p>
<p>Not that they likely minded, but the audience was rewarded for sitting through mostly B-sides with a brief two-song guest spot by Paul Weller, in which he and Noel performed one of the Jam's best B-sides, ""The Butterfly Collector"", and the Beatles' ""All You Need Is Love"". A thrill in the room I'm sure, but it all feels sort of rote and almost expected from a Noel Gallagher set rather than a nice surprise. It doesn't help that the usually simmering and bitter ""Butterfly"" is flat and the Beatles song is, you know, ""All You Need Is Love"".</p>
<p>From there, Noel mostly rolled out the hits, all sounding fine, and an awkward cover of the Smiths' ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"", whose fatalist, adolescent-appealing romanticism seems to both befuddle Gallagher and make for an awkward fit on a album recorded and released to prevent teenagers from dying. Ending with that and the jaunty ""Married With Children"", it's clear that the songs picked here have no specific message to impart or connection to the charity at hand, which is just as well. For Gallagher to suddenly play off as if they did, he'd risk being the hypocritical superstar he so clearly loathes. That he instead took the occasion to spotlight a slightly lesser-known part of his career elevates this set above a standard charity effort; that he focused on the first two years of his career elevates it above most of the other Oasis records this decade.</p></div>"|13082.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13082-the-dreams-we-have-as-children/|6.2|Scott Plagenhoef

Originally released in 1960, it was Davis' studio follow-up to the landmark <i>Kind of Blue</i>, and it found him, yet again, striking out in an entirely new direction.</p>
<p>Working with arranger Gil Evans, Davis cooked up a concept album, looking to the structure and texture of Spanish folk and classical music for inspiration. The two old friends and collaborators were on a huge roll creatively during this period. Davis was piling up hall of fame-caliber jazz albums with alarming regularity, while Evans, in addition to working with Davis frequently in the late 1950s, recorded what was perhaps his finest solo album in 1960, <i>Out of the Cool</i> (it vaguely shares a vibe with <i>Sketches</i>, but is in my estimation just a hair better). So to say both were in strong form here would be an understatement. Davis takes what is most striking about his trumpet style-- the controlled soloing in the middle register, with a mastery of subtle shifts in focus-- and amplifies it, creating measured phrases of almost painful intensity. While Evans' distinctive approach to harmony and tonal color-- one of the most enjoyable ""Hey, I get it!"" moments as you first explore jazz is when you start to recognize his arrangements-- inhabits a form that to the uninitiated can sound mysterious and exotic and sensual. It's hard not to be taken in immediately.</p>
<p>And that's the first thing to note about <i>Sketches of Spain</i>: Where Davis' ""Is this jazz?"" albums from the late-60s forward were often dense and challenging (""Is this even music?"" even came up now and then), <i>Sketches of Spain</i> was always easy to like. So much so that, like its predecessor, it became the kind of record that someone with only two or three albums by jazz artists might have in their collection. That's partly up to its potential contexts being so variable. There's a lot going on in the music that rewards a close listen, but it's also something you can put on and read to (though admittedly, some of the dynamic surges could be a little jolting). It's often quiet and atmospheric, at points coming over as almost ambient. It's the kind of album that dims the light in the room whenever it plays. It's also absolutely gorgeous.</p>
<p>The writers of <i>The Penguin Guide to Jazz</i> felt that the moodiness of <i>Sketches of Spain</i> dominated to the point where it added up to something closer to glorified elevator music. There is some merit to their claim, but the criticism now seems, interestingly, dated. The majority of people encountering a record like <i>Sketches of Spain</i> for the first time probably have no special interest in jazz as an idea, and the notion of pursuing atmospheric records whose primary selling point is an overriding feel and an abiding surface-level prettiness is nothing to be embarrassed about. If we want something more forward with more improvisation and interplay, hey, there are a billion other records out there. But <i>Sketches of Spain</i> does something special.</p>
<p>There's a real charge that comes from the distant, clattering percussion that begins ""Concierto de Aranjuez (Adagio)"", the opening track and centerpiece. It's a piece by Spanish composer Joaquín Rodrigo, and if you hear it played with a classical guitar and full orchestra, you realize both how faithful Evans was to it in terms of structure and what he accomplished as far as texture. Using French horn, harp, oboe, and bassoon, as well as more typically jazz brass instruments like trumpet and trombone (Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb, the rhythm section of Davis' band, are both on hand, but they're playing charts-- there's no room here for improvisation), Evans creates a shifting tapestry of luscious sound. Sometimes the music just seems to hang in the air, and sometimes it lurches toward an unexpected climax. Davis is the only soloist on the record, and he burrows deeply into the melodies, turning them over with a huge, bulbous tone that's both strong and vulnerable. He sounds especially impassioned on ""Saeta"", a piece whose scales reflect the influence of North African music on flamenco. It opens with a march and a fanfare, and then Davis blasts an uncanny solo-- slow, choosing between a small handful of notes, but so intent and concentrated that his trumpet almost seems to be splintering. The contrasts between Evans velvety but complex backdrops and Davis' extemporaneous work out front is compelling from start to finish.</p>
<p>The problem with this edition is a familiar one to anyone who has followed the never-ending Miles Davis reissue campaign: There's an extra disc of material here, all of which was issued elsewhere and most of which is of interest primarily to collectors, and that extra disc inflates the suggested retail of the set to $25. That's a lot of scratch when you get down to what you're really paying for if you don't own the set already, and that's the first five tracks from the original record, 41 minutes of music total. Disc One, in addition to the full album, does contain the sessions' one true outtake, ""Song of Our Country"". It's easy to see why it was left off, since its tone is several shades brighter and the arrangement is more firmly entrenched in jazz proper-- it actually sounds closer to something from <i>Miles Ahead</i>, the 1957 Evans/Davis big band set. But it's still worth owning, even if it was later compiled into one of Davis' many odds-and-ends sets, 1980's <i>Directions</i>.</p>
<p>Eight of the 11 tracks on the second disc consist of alternate takes, including four that cover sections of ""Concierto"". As good as some of this material is, you'll never reach for this sequence over the master unless you're researching the subtle differences in the solos. A live version of ""Concierto"" from 1961, the only time Davis performed this material in concert, is the most worthwhile inclusion by far. But by the end of the disc we're hearing ""Teo"" from the 1961 album <i>Someday My Prince Will Come</i>, and all of a sudden Coltrane is soloing, which makes no sense whatsoever in this painstakingly arranged context. As the notes indicate, ""Teo"" bears a melodic and thematic resemblance to material on <i>Sketches</i>, and though that's true, its inclusion here is dubious. It seems more a way to pad out a set that needs to be of a certain length to justify the price tag. Better that this edition had included ""Song of Our Country"" and the live ""Concierto"" as bonus cuts on a single disc. The liner notes, by composer Gunther Schuller, a ""Third Stream"" pioneer who mixed jazz and classical, are informative and well done and do add value. The music benefits from his analysis, which is technical but still accessible.</p>
<p>So the score given here reflects a compromise between the vast musical riches of the original album and the questionable packaging of the reissue. I wish I could say that <i>Sketches</i> is an album that turntable owners should just seek out on inexpensive used vinyl-- with a jazz record this popular, there are plenty of copies floating around. But the music is so subtle and detailed, surface noise really can get in the way here. <i>Sketches</i> is a masterpiece that opens up with a close listen, with every detail of the music clearly audible. So do seek it out, but if you do so with this edition, it'll cost you a few bucks.</p></div>"|13088.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13088-sketches-of-spain-legacy-edition/|8.0|Mark Richardson

So much  so that it's almost pointless to mention that she was one-half of  the (newly reunited) electronic duo Blectum From Blechdom. After eight  years and a few solo albums, the glitchy, rude electronic music she  made with partner Blevin Blectum tells you little about how she got  to where she is, and a lot about the kinds of musical leaps Blechdom  makes from record to record.</p>
<p><i>Gentlemania</i> is just the latest of Blechdom's albums about relationships. On 2005's<i> Eat My Heart Out,</i> she packed in confessional songs, tracks that wrapped  heartache in humor. Blechdom spilled her guts, both literally (the cover  features her topless with a handful of animal entrails) and figuratively,  though she did so over programed pop ballads and cheery musical numbers.  Three years earlier, on <i>I Heart Presets</i>, Blechdom made tender tracks  about labelmate Miguel Depedro (Kid606). She's gotten wiser over  time, observing love as an absurdity far stranger than the absurdities  she'd imagined on past records. And her music has fallen into more recognizable  genre conventions, as if Blechdom's decided her feelings were scrambled  and jarring enough on their own.</p>
<p>Her genre is emotion, not sound. Though <i>Gentlemania</i> cycles through  a few (musical theater pomp, bluegrass, torch song), it feels closest  to the light pop of 1970s and 80s confessional singer-songwriters, their  mix of vulnerability and wry self-awareness. ""Lazy"", swings  back and forth with its pretty piano chorus and whistled melody. It  sways somewhere between the lovelorn soul-lite of <i>Tapestry</i>-era  Carole King, and the breezy quirk of, say, Captain and Tenille. The profane,  jokey nature of her past albums gives way to a sweetly innocent lyrical  sense, delivered in Blechdom's boyish voice. On ""It's All Been  Done Before"", she calls her lover the ""best thing since sliced  bread"" and the one curse word in ""Lazy"", is blocked out  by a slide whistle.</p>
<p>Blechdom's songwriting partner and producer, Mocky, deserves a lot  of credit for the evenness and subtle complexity of these songs, hinting  at different genres and moods without spilling over into comedy or arbitrary  stylistic variation. Knowing exactly when to crescendo, or when to drop  in a chorus of backing voices, makes Blechdom's simplest songs sound  bigger, torchier. It's nice to see Blechdom find places where vulnerability  doesn't equal weakness. Across <i>Gentlemania</i> she says ""please""  but never begs. She doles out equal amounts of self-criticism and complaints.  On ""Monster"", a highlight that, unlike most of the other tracks,  indulges in balls-out bluegrass banjo and uninhibited ""yeehaws,"" her twang wraps around an admission: ""My brain don't work/ My  heart's a jerk,"" she admits. Joke songs are never this apologetic,  nor are they usually followed by a song as pretty and heartfelt as ""Running  Away"", where Blechdom realizes that she must put off a relationship  until she and her lover are more mature, just so the two ""won't  feel so alone.""</p>
<p>Still, I didn't expect that Blechdom's wild imagination would lead  her so close to convention. And so there are elements of <i>Gentlemania</i> where it's hard to tell if she's included them because they're  par for the genre, or because she's falling into cliché. She's too  smart for the latter, though I wonder why she uses boilerplate wordplay  (""I need the rest of you/ I need a rest from you,"" ""Don't think  it over/ Don't think it's over,"" ""It's all been done before/ But we're not done for"") so often. There's something sweet about  Blechdom making an album this earnest, but I miss her perverse sense  of humor. No point in asking after it or saying you'd like to hear  something different next time; she's probably two albums ahead anyway.</p></div>"|13080.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13080-gentlemania/|7.4|Jessica Suarez

A razor-thin electric guitar and fleet drums add bulk from beneath just before the song's first half empties into silence, the piano notes scattering through the tape like fireworks across a dark sky. A finger-picked acoustic guitar returns, peaking from beneath the ashes before springing into big, open chords. This time, a larger, more emphatic ensemble joins, offering handclaps alongside a kickdrum and chanted harmonies around the rhythm. Balmorhea-- formerly so quiet and subtle, a duo plus guests-- suddenly feel like a large choir stomping and singing behind their minister's springtime revival.</p>
<p>For their first two albums, Austin's Balmorhea gingerly augmented basic but beautiful piano and acoustic guitar patterns with electronics, field recordings, and strings to create exquisite if polite instrumental music. Like the minimal wire mobiles of American artist Alexander Calder, the songs were as much about the shadow they cast-- the full effect of Calder's work depended on the light in the room or the color of the walls; Balmorhea's pliable sound bent to one's emotional state-- as they were about any specific confluence of notes. But out of the gate, ""Settler"" exclaims an expanded six-piece lineup and a less nebulous direction, offering the sort of resolution Balmorhea have long foregone. Like ""Gobbledigook"", the handclap-heavy pop gem that led Sigur Rós' <i>Með  suð í eyrum við spilum endalaust</i> last year, ""Settler"" declares  that its makers are capable of something other than slow-building brood.</p>
<p>That growth<i> </i> doesn't come without its pains, though. At its worst, <i>All Is Wild</i> recalls watching a once-charming child transition through a difficult puberty while one can only stand aside, wishing upon it a beautiful adulthood. See, Balmorhea have always made romantic music. For piano, think Philip Glass' <i>Glassworks</i>, not Charlemagne Palestine's <i> Strumming Music</i>; for guitar, less Takoma, more Windham Hill. But themes that formerly worked as suggestive romantic skeletons become melodramatic and maudlin to the point of distraction here. In full-band form, Balmorhea can sound terribly stiff, hidebound into odd angles by the parts they've built. ""Harm &amp; Boon"", for example, smolders with piano and strings up front but suddenly springs into full-rock mode, a splintering electric guitar grinding across a simple beat. The guitar and the strings move in countering intervals, crisscrossing the rhythm in interlocking webs. The instruments don't move with grace or freedom, though, as much as they simply seem to be reading notes from a page. The movements become awkward tumbles and recoveries, unsuccessful attempts to create musical elasticity that releases and restores potential energy in gallops. The album is even sequenced to that non-effect: Tracks one, three, and five are all distended, jarring pieces with grand crescendos; the even-numbered tunes are like warm tiger balm, gentle numbers meant to massage the tension of their surroundings. Like the tracks themselves, the arches prove a tad mechanical.</p>
<p>Despite all this, <i>All Is  Wild</i> suggests a bright future for Balmorhea, even if by way of an unfortunate present. Although the band's expanded beyond the spartan approach of its earlier works, the material maintains a blissfully elemental complexity, meaning that-- even if the lines twist and the crescendos stack-- Balmorhea's remains the sort of chamber rock music that can be explored in a backyard or in a living room by friends playing without plugs. At its best, it returns demanding classical grandeur to a comfortable folk base. What's more, many of the individual textures and themes here are brilliant, from the patient, walking banjo-and-guitar line that leads ""Remembrance"" to the strings slashing back through the inspiring build of ""Coahuila"". And the album's closing third-- three interconnected tunes that rise and slink with a patience that the album's start skips-- is perfect, steadily winding through radiant acoustic tones. The swells are surefooted, and the various movements seem designed for one another, not simply stapled together.

It's an example, perhaps, of a globetrotting  pop star singing about what he knows (his food writing doesn't translate  into three-minute singles quite as well). But the band isn't nearly  as risky, uninhibited, and freewheeling when it comes to its own music.  The group's sophomore album sounded like a heavyweight repressing  from the same post-punk revival mold used to make its debut, and the  recent <i>Tonight </i>came off as a tease, flirting with synthesizers  and a few new directions, not to mention a rotating cast of producers.  Though, to its credit, the band endured numerous false starts in an  attempt to get it right-- the making-of saga even boasts a human bone-as-percussion  studio story-- <i>Tonight</i> hinted at opportunity without fully seizing  it.</p>
<p><i>Blood,</i> an album-length  dub version of <i>Tonight</i>, arrives as an experimental spin on the  band's music at a time when they're already toying with their formula.  Though it was previously included as part of a deluxe box set and released  in limited quantities for Record Store Day,<i> Blood</i> isn't merely  a collectible or curiosity. Described as ""Franz through Dan's filter""-- a reference to producer Dan Carey, the former Mad Professor apprentice  who was the last person to fill the producer's chair during the making  of <i>Tonight-- </i>it's filled with relaxed recalibrations of the  source material. While groups like Easy Star have made a cottage industry  out of recording new dub covers, <i>Blood </i> goes the traditional route by rearranging and remixing elements of the  original music.</p>
<p>Carey may have spent time recently  working with Lily Allen and Kylie, but he hasn't lost his feel for  reggae. ""Feel the Envy"", which unspools the slippery bass line and  bubbling synths of ""Send Him Away"" and submerges the song in reverberations,  and ""Feeling Kind of Anxious"", where Kapranos' words cycle and  careen off the walls of an echo chamber, are prime examples. ""Backwards  on My Face"", a slack remix of ""Twilight Omens"", wallows in a low  groove, springy but crisp snare beats, and vocoded croaks that used to  be Kapranos' lyrics. Many of the album's best moments recast parts  of the original songs in ways that underline their melodic strength,  especially the bass lines of Bob Hardy. ""Katherine Hit Me"", a reworking  of ""No You Girls"", glides by on the original track's tight, funky  bass line, a solid frame that stands up to the shift towards a half-time  tempo and meandering effects. Carey's work calls to mind <i>Echo Dek</i>,  Adrian Sherwood's deft reworking of the master tapes of Primal Scream's <i> Vanishing Point</i>, including the slightly darker, paranoid bent. Despite  the album's anxiety-prone songs titles, Franz sound relaxed and just  as cocksure on these remixes, rarely forced.</p>
<p>While the songs are well-constructed, <i> Blood </i>is intriguing to a certain point but lacking the jolt necessary  to transcend the concept. Perhaps that's putting unfair expectation  on what is a well-executed one-off exercise, but some tracks feel a  bit winded-down as opposed to re-imagined. For every channel-shifting  echo effect on the album, there are moments, like the pulsating synths  on ""Die on the Floor"" or stretches where Kapranos' vocals are  looped, that call to mind standard dance remixes, standard being the  key word. It's arguable how ""dub"" a few of these tracks are--  much like <i>Tonight, </i>they don't fully commit. Franz's music  is usually as crisp and tight as its constructivist cover art, and though  reformatted, stretched out, and slowed down on <i>Blood,</i> it still  maintains a strong pulse. Hopefully this playful detour leads to more  easygoing experimentation when Franz Ferdinand start cracking skulls  together for the next full length.</p></div>"|13086.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13086-blood/|6.4|Patrick Sisson

Hours before a show in Columbus, Georgia, they threatened to  quit unless they got better pay and better treatment; Soul Brother #1  fired them and flew in the Pacemakers, a bunch of teenagers from Cincinnati  who knew his songs as well as any other funk band in those days. In  fact, they were the first band he'd played with who'd grown up on funk,  and they included a pair of world-class musicians-- guitarist Phelps  ""Catfish"" Collins and his bassist brother William ""Bootsy""  Collins. For the next year, Brown's flame burned even hotter than it  ever had before or would again.</p>
<p>The string of classic singles  that band recorded are all included here, beginning with ""Get Up  (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine"". Banged out in two takes in a  late-night studio visit a mere six weeks after that Columbus gig, it's  a funk firebomb that would've defined anyone else's career and was just  another hit for Brown. Within the year, they also cut ""Super Bad""  (whose squalling, free-jazz-inspired sax solo by Robert McCullough seemed  unthinkable as part of a dance record until JB pulled it off), ""Soul  Power"", ""Talking Loud and Saying Nothing"" and a hurtling,  screaming freakout called ""Get Up, Get Into It, and Get Involved"",  all of them massive hits.</p>
<p>By this point, Brown had mostly  abandoned songs-as-we-know-them, although he did release a ballad called  ""I Cried"" that he'd written for Tammy Montgomery in the early 60s, as well as a duet with Lyn Collins on his own oldie ""Just  Won't Do Right"". The new band's formula was single-chord riffs  (and maybe a bridge on the subdominant), fantastically tricky grids  of rhythms and horns, and a couple of hook phrases, sometimes traded  with former Famous Flame Bobby Byrd (that's him yelling the ""get  on up"" part of ""Sex Machine""). That's all they needed.</p>
<p>Brown had always thrived on  the spontaneity of his live show, and his new style let him fly as freely  on record as he did on stage. Almost all of his early-70s hits have  moments that give off the heat of creation in the instant. The loping  hard-funk version of ""Talking Loud and Saying Nothing"" features  JB yelling to engineer Ron Lenhoff to ""keep the tape running""  as he decides <i>in the middle of the take</i> to add its spectacular  <i>a cappella</i> breakdown. ""Escape-Ism"" wasn't even a composition  before it was a recording-- it was a warmup jam that Lenhoff thought  to record (with another new lineup, which had at that point been together  for barely two weeks under the direction of trombonist Fred Wesley),  and it went Top 10 on the R&amp;B charts.</p>
<p>The new crop of musicians who  joined up in early 1971 weren't nearly as virtuosic as the Collins brothers  (memorable quote from the liner notes, on ""Make It Funky"":  ""Second guitarist Robert Coleman deserves a nod for sticking with  his humble three notes and staying out of the way""). Fortunately,  Wesley was a brilliant bandleader who knew how to make a lot out of  a little. ""Hot Pants"", the four-part ""Make It Funky""  (released as two consecutive singles), and ""I'm a Greedy Man""  are all juggernaut dance records that turn out, on inspection, to be  constructed out of fairly simple components.</p>
<p>As with every volume of this  mail-order-only series, Brown's lapses in taste are revealed a few times,  although there aren't many on this set-- a pair of ludicrous Christmas  singles and an instrumental cover of Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears' ""Spinning  Wheel"". Also, Hip-O's completist approach to including every alternate  mix that hit airwaves or stores, as well as Brown's habit of splitting  songs over 45 sides, means that we get multiple consecutive versions  of a lot of titles: the two discs' 39 tracks represent 15 songs (and  a funny/sad anti-drug PSA). But it's hard to object to hearing ""Soul  Power"" or ""Sex Machine"" a few times in a row.</p></div>"|13091.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13091-the-singles-vol-7-1970-1972/|8.6|Douglas Wolk

It was fresh. It was  what the kids were getting into months before they were skewering Wavves  on message boards. There were interviews with Times New Viking, No Age, and Jay Reatard. Somewhere in the shuffle were Tyvek, a goofy Detroit  five-piece that, despite a ""Buzzworthy"" nod, seems to have stayed  relatively subterranean. And if their posture, stage presence, or frontguy  Kevin Boyer's on-camera quip (""You can buy our sound at Guitar Center"")  were any kind of indicator, they probably couldn't give less of a  fuck. But you know, <i>not</i> in a Black Lips sort of way.</p>
<p>Big surprise then, that the band's  debut full-length doesn't sound as though it's mangling your speakers.  Coming to us via Siltbreeze-- a label whose releases have nearly always  sounded as though they were recorded on speakerphone through curtains  of snot-- the songs on <i>Tyvek</i> are relatively clean. They should  be also familiar to anyone that had a chance to see them live in the  past 18 months, as many of songs here were included on CD-Rs pressed  for touring.  And though cowlicks still pop up throughout, they  rarely detract from the character or integrity of the songs and album  as a whole. One of the only moments when sloppy  doesn't seem to fit, opener ""Circular Ruins"" is a clenched, vein-y  psych number that seems to substitute banging for just letting go.</p>
<p>Burners  like ""Summer Things"" and the crispy ""Hey Una"" balance that equation,  grafting layers of Feelies-inflected guitar melody onto runaway frameworks.  Those same guitars detonate in the record's dangerous middle section,  the cola rush of ""Frustration Rock"" and twin squiggles of ""Stand  and Fight""-- two standouts that really enjoy the bump in fidelity. As  means for cooling down, the same Mexican-tinged track with rotating  titles (""Sonora"", ""Tecate"", ""El Centro"", and ""Mexicali"")  offers brief interludes/beer breaks between the louder jams. It sounds  like rehearsal noise from three rooms away, and if pressed, one might  call it lazy. But it works, and if it didn't precede the near six minutes  of flyover noise and Motor City malaise that is pseudo-closer ""What  To Do"", I might long for it.</p>
<p>But the Big Kahuna is ""Building Burning  (Re-Edit)"", a herky-jerk garage epic that, in a series of movements, meets  its title halfway. Amps smoke. The bass bubbles up and pops. Boyer loses  the dry warble and his shit behind the microphone, using up all his  spit and juice by the time he's done. In a way, it exemplifies what's  most fascinating about <i>Tyvek</i> and Tyvek. Here they steamroll  their budget and continue imbuing their pop music with a menace that  feels like it was already built-in. So often, that song in particular  feels like it's about to overheat and come apart at its hinges. But  it never does.</p></div>"|13076.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13076-tyvek/|7.6|David Bevan

Who would've thought? The last time I paid any attention to this Ninja Tune fixture, he was making music for video games, which seemed like a pretty good reason to stop paying attention. Now he's teamed up with the British drum and bass producer Doubleclick to make a quick little album of apocalyptic slash-and-burn rap futurism, with 1999-vintage Timbo as their spirit animal and an actual one-time Tim protégé on board for a couple of tracks. So yeah, now they've got my attention.</p>
<p>It's going to be impossible to talk about Two Fingers without talking about Tim Mosley, since most of the album's good ideas are good ideas that Tim had years ago: off-kilter stop-start drums, chopped-up shards of Eastern instrumentation, oceans of negative space. And Tobin and Doubleclick can't quite do this stuff as well as Tim once could. But honestly, all that is fine, as Tim isn't really working this style ever since he decided to go full-on cheeseball Euro-dance, and anyway, the armies of post-Tim rap producers are a long, long way away from mining all the gold he put out there between 1997 and 2001. So when the album opens with the eerie clinking drums and backwards otherworldly guitar loop of ""Straw Men"", it's a weird nostalgic rush, like finding an old sci-fi pulp novel and marveling about how its visions of the future were so much cooler than how the future actually turned out. It helps that the British rapper Sway, who guests on this song and plenty more, absolutely murders the thing, never saying much or leaving much of a personality imprint but showing absolute mastery of a very particular breakneck technical style, one that works great for complimenting the oozing atmosphere around him.</p>
<p>Sway guests on seven of the album's tracks, and his participation is a mixed blessing. He was never a grime rapper, whatever that meant, and his staunch devotion to technical dexterity always stood in stark contrast to that scene's screaming chaos. Here, he sounds best talking blasted-earth Armageddon, like when he talks about the time he met some Brazilian gang types on ""What You Know"": ""The difference between them Gs and we/ Is they fighting for peace while we fight for a piece."" He seethes beautifully. But on an album that aims for dark cohesion as much as this one, I can't fathom why he'd devote two songs to relationship-rap or another, ""Jewels and Gems"", to sub-Canibus bits of forehead-slapping wisdom. For instance: ""You can't describe pictures without the words."" (This is his reason for believing that a picture is not, in fact, worth a thousand words.) Or: ""There's no evil in money; the evil's in the greed."" Don't think too hard there, buddy.</p>
<p>Former Timbaland mainstay Ms. Jade, who released a couple of great singles and a pretty good album in 2002 before disappearing completely, shows up for a couple of tracks, and it's great to hear that she can still wreck a track, even if she is saddled with substandard hooks. Dancehall siren Ce'cile also drops in for a track, her effortless, breezy cool nicely offsetting the heaviness erupting all around her. But <i>Two Fingers</i> really works best when it fades into a vaguely forbidding background throb. Sway, after all, is the sort of rapper who sounds best when you're not paying all that much attention to him, and there's a nice overhanging ominousness throughout the album. The brisk 40-minute run time keeps things from getting too oppressive or monochromatic. The tracks keep subtly shifting throughout, just enough to keep you interested without overwhelming you. Every once in a while, Tobin and Doubleclick pull out a great little trick like the moment on ""High Life"" where they distort Sway's voice so severely that it actually dissolves into clicks and beeps. The whole record is a smart little left-turn for everyone involved. And if it's not quite an unalloyed triumph, I would totally play a video game with this soundtrack.</p></div>"|13083.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13083-two-fingers/|7.1|Tom Breihan

Badass. One peeved-looking  elephant brandishing its tusks towards your fleshy bits as it stampedes  through the space-fog? Mega badass. Monolithic, lazer-show ready instrumental  prog rawk? Well, that can pass or play, but in combination with the  aforementioned twofer, you'd probably go with ""badass"" again,  huh? You'd think!</p>
<p>When the mood strikes, few bands  do bong-rips-in-your-Dodge-Dart badass quite like Pittsburgh's Zombi.  The sound Steve Moore and Anthony Paterra make-- equal parts Italo-funkers  Goblin, Can's lockstep whirl, intro music to educational filmstrips  of the 1970s, and Edgar Winter's undead ""Frankenstein""-- can  be almost impossibly epic. When it works, as it did over and  over again on 2006's <i>Surface to Air</i>, it feels like a vision quest through  the bowels of hell. But whereas <i>Surface</i> found myriad ways to match looming  dread with body-rocking thunder (they are on Relapse, after all), <i>Spirit  Animal</i> plays the extremes. The heights can be towering, the lows crushing,  but the relative lack of middle ground keeps <i>Spirit Animal</i> off balance  and a few shades shy of truly badass.</p>
<p>Instrumental rock of this sort requires  a certain ratio of tension and release; the tunes range in length from  a lean six minutes and change to the comfortably numbing 17-plus minutes  of closer ""Through Time"", and too much  time spent at either end of the spectrum can be stultifying when you  get into the lengthier numbers. Often <i>Spirit Animal</i> gets so caught  up in its own grooves it almost seems to forget there's anybody listening;  where a constant dynamism bubbled under the comparably hefty<i> Surface  to Air</i>, <i>Spirit Anim</i><i>al</i> too often finds Zombi settling into one mode or  the other-- spacey, or spooky, but mostly skull-smashing-- and letting  it ride just a touch too long. Individual moments can crush or creep,  but far too many riffs get turned every which way but out, and far too  few of those are quite badass enough to justify the time they spend  with 'em.</p>
<p><i>Spirit Animal</i> is almost certainly  the band's loudest effort; half-Zombi Steve Moore even sneaks a little  electric guitar in there, a first for the band on wax. If you'd told  me either of those things before I heard the record, I would've pegged  it as their best based on that alone; it's not that Zombi really needed  to get louder or introduce new elements into the mix, but that'd certainly  be a direction you'd think they'd revel in. They do, but as a listener,  it's hard not to feel bludgeoned by the oft-endless riffage that characterizes  much of <i>Spirit Animal</i>. Given their relatively small arsenal of instruments  and an apparent unwillingness to shed the ghosts of their influences,  I suppose there's only so many things they can do without going way  way out, and <i>Spirit Animal</i> finds them doing just that. But unlike <i>Surface  to Air</i>-- or even the terrific ""Infinity"" from their recent  split with Maserati-- the sprawl becomes a crawl, and the rift between  the parts that kick your butt and the parts that get you primed for  said butt kicking is just a bit too great for <i>Spirit Animal</i> to achieve  the kind of balance Zombi have been so adept at in the past. In the  end, <i>Spirit Animal</i> becomes less like the badass elephant on its front  and more like just another pachyderm; heavy, yes, but lumbering.</p></div>"|13046.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13046-spirit-animal/|5.3|Paul Thompson

I remember exactly where I bought it (a long-defunct used-CD store-- remember those?-- on Long Island), what the weather was like that day (windows-rolled-all-the-way-down sunny), and the tingly feeling of discovery while listening to it. A lot of people felt that same way, and when Jeff Buckley died three years after its release, his tragedy only added to what would become a bittersweet obsession. I tore through David Browne's thorough biography, <i>Dream Brother</i>. I bought 2000's stellar live album, <i>Mystery White Boy</i>, the day it came out. I watched the intense <i>Live in Chicago</i> DVD with big eyes. I went to several Jeff Buckley tribute nights in Chicago, where a variety of local talents interpreted their hero's work with sometimes-great, always-reverent covers. I could not get enough of this singer who was equal parts mystic, hippie, romantic, comic, and goofball. And then I got enough.</p>
<p>I don't remember exactly when I reached the Buckley threshold. Perhaps during a rom-com trailer that used ""Hallelujah"" a bit too liberally. Or maybe the mystique just turned into frustration and then slowly fizzled into nothingness. But I bet that for every person turned on to Jeff Buckley by the endless stream of rehashes and barrel-scraping releases, there's probably a one-time die hard fan losing their religion. The person who has embarrassingly belted the <i>Live at Sin-é</i> version of ""The Way Young Lovers Do""-- all 10 minutes of it-- while cruising between states doesn't need <i>Grace Around the World</i>. The person who has spent hours listening to <i>My Sweetheart the Drunk</i> and daydreaming about the kind of fucked up and beautiful sophomore album Buckley would have made doesn't need it. And neither does the person completely unfamiliar with Jeff-- there are dozens of superior entry points. I don't need <i>Grace Around the World</i>; you don't need <i>Grace Around the World</i>.</p>
<p>Buckley was to be a heritage artist for Columbia, following in the footsteps of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen as a talent who could retain credibility for years, whether or not the public ever came around. When they signed him, they were after credibility and a career with a full catalogue of LPs. At this point, they've got a lengthy Buckley catalogue even though the artist only has one official long-player to his name. This is problematic. Fan loyalty is difficult to cultivate but dead simple to take advantage of. And <i>Grace Around the World </i>is fairly shameless. The press release touts the deluxe 2xDVD/CD version-- featuring TV performances from across the globe circa 1994-95 and the documentary <i>Amazing Grace--</i> as ""up to 169 minutes of Jeff Buckley footage,"" infomercial style. And this really does seem to be a quantity-not-quality situation.</p>
<p>The main DVD showcases every song from <i>Grace</i> (with ""What Will You Say"" swapped in for ""Corpus Christi Carol"", which wasn't played on tour) from television tapings in London, Germany, France, New Orleans, Chicago, and Japan. Since they were being recorded for TV, the audience (if there is an audience) ostensibly isn't filled with Buckley devotees. Perhaps that's one of the reasons many of the songs are not just rote but sort of flat-- a stark contrast to the raucous <i>Live in Chicago</i> DVD, which showcased an entire gig, between-song banter and all. <i>Around the World </i>attempts to add some personality to the cobbled-together footage with snippets of an interview cut between tracks, but the ditsy host asking questions brings out Buckley's sometimes-noxious pretentious side and little else. Made up for the camera and looking tired at best (stiff at worst), few of these performances show Buckley at his prime. The undoubted highlight-- a sweaty, epic take on ""Lover You Should've Come Over""-- is also the only previously released portion of the main program.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the hour-long, 2004 documentary included in the deluxe version of the set, <i>Amazing Grace, </i>is well-intentioned but shoddy. The cheap doc heavily relies on old EPK footage and generally vapid talking-head commentary from everyone from Sebastian Bach to Duncan Sheik to a random classical composer inspired by <i>Grace</i>. And while the whole package is marketed as a ""love letter"" to fans, true followers will quickly be able to sniff out its inferiorities. If anything, this latest selection from the dwindling Buckley vaults subverts his talents and ultimately insults the same hardcore fans it's aimed at.</p></div>"|13077.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13077-grace-around-the-world/|3.5|Ryan Dombal

He's released jazz records, classical records, a soundtrack or two, collaborations with New Orleans R&amp;B overlord Allen Toussaint and mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter. And every few years, at least when he's not threatening to quit recording, he gets together with his actual rock band-- the Attractions or their current iteration, the Imposters-- and does what he's genuinely brilliant at.</p>
<p><i>Secret, Profane and Sugarcane </i>is not one of those rock-band albums. Costello recorded it in Nashville, backed up by an acoustic string-band including Jim Lauderdale, who sings harmonies on most of it, and the estimable dobro player Jerry Douglas. The most promising name in the credits, though, is producer T-Bone Burnett, who worked with Costello on 1986's <i>King of America</i> (as well as a nifty 1985 single credited to the Coward Brothers). <i>King</i> was a focused, fire-spitting album: a seething riposte to American culture and a conflicted love letter to American music.</p>
<p>The new record is no <i>King</i>: It's a gummy mishmash, an overambitious collection of table scraps and leftovers. (The forced wordplay of the title is the first sign that it's trying to cover too much ground.) There are remakes of a couple of songs that have been kicking around the Costello repertoire for ages (""Complicated Shadows"" and ""Hidden Shame"", both of which previously turned up on the expanded version of <i>All This Useless Beauty</i>); there are a handful of fussy arias salvaged from a never-finished opera about Hans Christian Andersen and Jenny Lind, and a song dropped from 2004's <i>The Delivery Man</i>. There's a songwriting collaboration with Loretta Lynn, and two more with Burnett. One of the latter, a pastiche of <i>Good Old Boys</i>-era Randy Newman called ""Sulphur to Sugarcane"", is the closest thing to a keeper here (and the song from the album that Costello's been playing live the most), although it'd probably be more striking at three minutes than six. The version of the old Bing Crosby/Patti Page standard ""Changing Partners"" that closes the album is the most sensitive performance on it-- Costello's always had a great ear for covers. It's also a simpler, better-crafted song than any of his originals here.</p>
<p>The glory of the Attractions/Imposters is that they can make basically anything in Costello's repertoire sound good--even when the songwriting flags or Elvis oversings, they're fiery and idiomatic enough to keep things interesting. The Sugarcanes, as this album's ensemble will be called when they back Costello on tour this summer, are a fine, subtle, tasteful group, but accompanying this particular frontman occasionally calls for a degree of bluntness or spotlight-hogging they can't supply. When he tries to evoke early Johnny Cash on the remake of ""Hidden Shame"", their boom-chicka-boom lacks snap; when he slows down to a midtempo stroll or torch-song crawl, they don't bother to attempt the Americana-as-critique ferocity of <i>King of America</i>. And when he cranks up his delivery to spit'n'sneer, as on ""My All Time Doll"", they just get railroaded.</p>
<p>At its worst, this is effectively a contemporary acoustic neo-<i>No</i>-<i>Depression</i> record with Costello's signature vocal tics slapped on top. It's yet another entry in his string of gestural albums-- another argument that he's not ""just"" the rocker with a rock band whose rock songs still form the backbone of most of his live performances, both in their native idiom and out of it. But whoever suggested that being one of the great rock musicians was something he should aspire to move <i>beyond</i>?</p></div>"|13079.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13079-secret-profane-and-sugarcane/|3.8|Douglas Wolk

At the very least, his initial tenure with the Stooges earned him more than his share of bricks in the modern rock foundation. Beyond that, his very survival in the face of untold self-destruction merits a few slaps on the back, too, and his first two solo albums, recorded with the help of buddy and benefactor David Bowie, remain classics in their own right. Since then, however, there's hardly been an Iggy Pop record worth listening to more than once, if that, and sadly that includes the unlikely Stooges reunion record, <i>The Weirdness</i>. With the untimely passing of Stooges guitarist Ron Asheton, that reunion unfortunately becomes a one-off, and sends Iggy back to wandering the wilderness as a solo artist.</p>
<p>Of course, given his all-over-the-place career, there's no reason to believe Iggy wouldn't have made <i>Préliminaires</i>, the follow-up to <i>The Weirdness</i> and the first Iggy Pop solo disc since 2003's <i>Skull Ring</i>, anyway. Still, <i>Préliminaires</i> comes as a sharp left turn: Inspired by <i>The Possibility of an Island</i> by blithely provocative French novelist (and occasional filmmaker and musician) Michel Houellebecq, <i>Préliminaires</i> ""comes dangerously near jazz,"" Pop claims in the press notes, clearly forgetting, like everyone else, that he recorded some of the shitty <i>Avenue B</i> with Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood. But in truth <i>Préliminaires</i> is less jazz than Iggy Pop as Euro-pop, á la Leonard Cohen circa <i>I'm Your Man</i>, crooning over a bed of mostly mushy and melancholy electronics and beats.</p>
<p><i>Préliminaires</i> was recorded largely with collaborator Hal Cragin, who may as well be Hal Wilner for all the satisfaction he takes in tossing Iggy in relatively unfamiliar waters. But Pop makes the most of his new environment to expand his palette and his palate in one fell swoop. Heck, the disc even begins with Iggy mumbling Joseph Kosma and Jacques Prévert's ""Les Feuilles Mortes""-- in French!-- ceding the microphone for a swooning smooth sax solo, about the last thing anyone would have expected from him, but yet further proof that the singer is not the dum dum boy people have always made him out to be.</p>
<p>Recasting himself as a Gallic crooner isn't necessarily a smart move, granted, but it is audacious, and amidst the drifting ennui Iggy demonstrates his trademark nihilism does translate even distantly removed from his caveman roots. ""It's nice to be dead/ It's nice to be underground/ Free of the ugly sounds of life,"" intones Pop on ""Nice to Be Dead"", one of the more memorable tracks on the album, and also one of the few that veers closer to rock than easy listening. The sentiment's a fine epigraph for a singer several lives beyond his allotted nine but clearly comfortable where's he landed late in his career. Plus, even if the music rarely rises to such rousing heights elsewhere, Iggy's lyrical passenger is still clearly riding through the city's backsides, taking notes.</p>
<p>Elsewhere Iggy contemplates death by the sea (""Spanish Coast""), covers Jobim (""How Insensitive""), slops out some existential blues (""He's Dead/She's Alive""), and goes faux disco with the blasé irony of ""Party Time"". ""It's party time,"" he grumbles, ""and I smell slime/ The stupid people/ Make me evil."" It's a misanthropic sentiment worthy of the Stooges in their prime, but here Iggy sounds beaten, the lyrics revealing his innermost thoughts even as his body goes through the motions.</p>
<p>""Like Daniel, [<i>The Possibility of an Island</i>'s] protagonist, I too have grown weary of a career as an entertainer, and I wish for a new life,"" revealed Iggy Pop in a statement perhaps not out of character for a highly physical (and likely perpetually sore) rock star in his sixties. Weary it (and he) does sound here, beaten, even bored, if not outright boring. But by being boring on purpose, Iggy ironically proves himself oddly more compelling than on his many past accidents. If it's not an album for the ages so much as for the aged, at least it's one you may want to hold on to a bit and give another shot when you get closer to where Iggy's at himself right now.</p></div>"|13084.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13084-preliminaires/|5.4|Joshua Klein

While that may sound like quintessential question-begging, it's not, as bassist Jared Warren and drummer Coady Willis added guitarist Toshi Kasai before writing and recording much of number three. To these ears, Willis and Warren have always been a pop band that clad great hooks-- listen for ""Eis Hexe"" from <i>Head For the Shallow</i>, or ""Grounds for Divorce"" from <i>Here Come the Waterworks</i>-- within thick metal plates. They've had fun, too, taking risks with the occasional expansive instrumental track or a hard-charging tune that, without warning, opens wide into synthesizer wizardry and choral vocals. Infinitely likable and accessible but ultimately distinct and identifiable, Big Business have long seemed hard rock's answer to Phoenix. Aside from both having backed more-established acts (Phoenix once backed Air; <i>Mind the Drift</i> is Big Business' second since becoming an official half of the Melvins), both bands take magnetic pop cores and cast them into surprising musical contexts. Phoenix goes for sharp guitars and billowing keyboards. Big Business go for skuzzy bass and busy drums.</p>
<p><i>Mind the Drift</i> seems to be an expansion of that: Willis still viciously circumnavigates his drumkit with authority and adventure. Warren still manhandles a viscous bass tone that he funnels into heavy themes. Kasai adds texture and dimension, augmenting what's there instead of adulterating it. The hooks are still memorable, and the arrangements are still heavy. On ""The Drift"", for instance, bass and guitar are locked into a direct charge, while Willis dances on and around the beat with his cymbals. ""You take the east/ And I'll take the west/ If we meet in the middle/ We'll know,"" barks Warren, his voice handled better than ever before by producer Phil Ek. On single ""Gold and Final"", Kasai's guitar actually takes the lead, twisting through an anxious, repetitive phrase. He keeps his tone and sound small, though, a juxtaposition that emphasizes the size of the giants-- bass, guitar, and Warren and Willis' countering vocals-- towering overhead. This album's mid-point weirdness, ""I Got It Online"", works through a similar spatial effect. Warren anxiously shouts phrases like ""Too many squares/ Too many cruds/ Too many nerds."" His distorted bass and Willis' restless drum beating wrestle Kasai's guitar pattern-- staccato notes nervously scattered through the mix with delay-- for room. Lyrically and musically, it's an epic battle of nerves. In duo form, the tune would've sounded incomplete.</p>
<p>And perhaps that's what some folks have liked about Big Business all along: Where I heard pop possibility turned tough, I suppose others simply heard two guys beating pretty good songs about social anxieties into a heavy metal mess. For some, Kasai's addition has worked as a distraction from that unequivocal beastliness. I reckon those folks will really dislike ""Theme From Big Business II"", a finessed seven-minute metal anthem with an arching guitar line, chimes, and well-placed harmonies that sound a little like Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash gone wild. For the most part, Warren sticks his bass playing to the script, and Willis builds his drum lines through well-considered waves. Kasai, meanwhile, is all over the place, making his guitar mirror a horn before sweeping through a fast cycle of riffs and variations. I think it rules, and I loved <i>Big Business I</i>. Maybe you loved <i>Big Business I</i>, too, but you hate this. That would be too bad.</p></div>"|13055.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13055-mind-the-drift/|7.1|Grayson Currin

In the case of Chicago-based highlife revivalists Occidental Brothers Dance Band International, the International carries  both meanings. This is music with the potential to appeal to many types  of listeners, and the band spans not only borders but the Atlantic Ocean,  with members from the United States and Ghana.</p>
<p>Former British colonies Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria have long histories of highlife music,  beginning with the acoustic palmwine sounds of coastal towns and progressing  to big dance bands and ultimately the guitar bands of the last 40 years and the recent rise the hiplife rap/highlife hybrid. It's the  guitar band and palmwine periods that OBDBI draw much of their inspiration  from, with a dash of jazz for good measure.</p>
<p>Founder/guitarist Nathaniel  Braddock met vocalist/trumpeter Kofi Cromwell and percussionist Daniel ""Rambo"" Asamoah on a trip to Ghana. The  pair spent much of the 80s playing in the highlife band Western Diamonds  in their homeland, and Cromwell wings in English, Fante, and Twi on <i> Odo Sanbra</i>. The mix the band cooks up is as intoxicating as the  palmwine that lent the original music its name, and the group closes  with a version of the standard ""Yaa Amponsah"", done in  a spry but laid-back arrangement led by Braddock's snaking acoustic  guitar (to hear a brilliant 1928 recording of the song, check out Heritage's  Kumasi Trio compilation). Another instrumental, ""Masanga"", is an  album highlight, featuring a gorgeous duet between sax player Greg Ward  and guest violinist Andrew Bird over cyclical acoustic guitar figures  and just enough percussion to outline the beat.</p>
<p>Ward's sax is something to  behold-- in tandem with Cromwell, he plays the kind of stabbing accents  that give this music its extra push, but he also weaves in some outstanding  counterpoint to Braddock, taking the role that would normally be occupied  by a second guitar on the title track, which translates to ""Come Back,  Love"". ""Circle Circle Circle"", a song about chaotic traffic in  Accra, Ghana's capitol city, features a gutteral guest vocal from hiplife  MC Yao Osufui that provides a stark, machine-gun contrast to Ward's  fluid solo over the song's first half. For Westerners looking for an  easy foot in the door, a good one might be the band's outstanding cover  of New Order's ""Bizarre Love Triangle"", a song whose simple chord  structure makes an easy transition to highlife arrangements, with the  horns cleverly taking on the original synth parts.</p>
<p>On <i>Odo Sanbra</i>, Occidental  Brothers Dance Band International earn a place alongside their highlife  forebears by doing their own thing with the music and emerging with  a sound that pays tribute to the past while moving the form forward.  Having two genuine highlife stars in the band certainly helps, but everybody  pulls his weight-- Braddock has a true grasp of West African guitar  styles, bassist Joshua Ramos gets the bounce and swing of the music, and Ward has a brilliant sense of phrasing and flow. If highlife is  going to get the revival it deserves, it could scarcely ask for better  ambassadors.</p></div>"|13170.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13170-odo-sanbra/|7.6|Joe Tangari

""Cause the years fly by in an instant, and you wonder what he's waiting for,"" he offers. ""Then some skinny bitch walks by in some hot pants and he's running out the door."" While the one-time Britpop sex god was almost definitely speaking from experience, the song took on a professorial tone. This is a guy who's done almost all there is to do in rock-- from toiling in the 1980s to exploding and then coming down with Pulp in the 90s-- and, on <i>Jarvis</i>, he seemed ready to look back on a winning career with equal parts despair and whimsy. Despair because he's a 40-something rock'n'roller who's smart enough to know what that can look like, and whimsy because he's Jarvis Cocker. Age looked and sounded good on him; he was growing into his elbow patches well.</p>
<p>Alas, Cocker's life of peace is not to be. ""Further complications in store, yeah!"" he yelps on the opener here, introducing a cracked and wily album markedly more invigorated than his previous solo effort, but not always for the best. An abundance of ill-advised facial hair along with songs titles like ""Homewrecker!"" and ""I Never Said I Was Deep"" suggested it, and then tabloids confirmed it-- this is a breakup album. But <i>Further Complications</i> isn't one of those maudlin, woe-is-me affairs (as if Jarvis was capable of such mawkishness). It's a jutting, joking, hard-riffing jolt filled with raw self-deprecation. He's not blue-filtered and contemplative on his album cover, he's scrunched up against stark white, like the goofy aftermath of a Robert Longo drawing. ""If every relationship is a two-way street, I have been screwing in the back whilst you drive,"" he admits, arching his brow while holding an antique magnifying glass up to his own inadequacies.</p>
<p>The line is from ""I Never Said I Was Deep"", the album's clearest contender for a future comp. On it, Cocker plays a game with the listener, i.e, how unsympathetic can he make himself while still drawing adoration from his audience? ""I never said that I was clever,"" he croons on a hook that's quite clever. ""My morality is shabby, my behavior unacceptable,"" he self-critiques later on. But right before you can think, ""C'mon Jarvis, don't beat yourself up, man,"" he delivers both the song's thematic peak and its narrative nadir: ""No, I'm not looking for a relationship-- just a willing receptacle."" The sentiment is damn near unforgivable, but Cocker survives it unscathed. Elevated, even. Backed by woozy, nonchalantly soulful instrumentation, the song is a thinking man's anti-thinking anthem and it's several kinds of genius.</p>
<p>When the lanky frontman allows his current rawk jonze to take over, things get a bit pricklier. For someone famous for his dramatic flair, enlisting producer Steve Albini was not the most obvious choice. And it's not like the austere, anti-reverb studio rat was going to adjust his style for Jarvis-- the dry Albini snares and unfussy live-ness is well in place. Thing is, Jarvis can't quite pull off some of these herky jerky Stooge-y tracks. (On record, at least-- several songs here came off much better with Jarvis gesticulating furiously during his U.S. tour last year.) While his songwriting remains funny and incisive at 45, ostensibly ballsier numbers like ""Fuckingsong"" and ""Angela"" veer dangerously close to bar-band boneheadedness. I know, I know: He never said he was deep. But still, Jarvis Cocker can't start popping-out largely wordless motorik like ""Pilchard""-- a song he apparently ""never got around to writing,"" according to a recent interview-- and expect to strut away scot-free. A move like that is more unforgivable than a thousand Wilde-style put-downs.</p>
<p>""Kittens are cute, but a full grown cat can be cuter,"" sings Jarvis on the easy listening ballad ""Hold Still"". It's wishful thinking, even for a guy facing middle age with heaps of respectably bold fearlessness and a solid head of hair. On <i>Further Complications,</i> Cocker is a wreck-- a sometimes amusing (""Leftovers""), sometimes profane (""Fuckingsong"") jumble of anger and concession. ""In the beginning there was nothing, and to be honest that suited me just fine,"" he growls on the title track. But Jarvis isn't meant for a quiet life. He's too good at turning social pratfalls into proletariat art. He still hasn't figured things out, and he's coming to terms with the fact that he never will. ""It's a complicated boogie, and I don't know any better,"" he screams on the title track. He sounds frustrated, but he shouldn't be. There are only a few songwriters who can make life's technical dance moves seem like such a worthwhile pursuit.</p></div>"|13151.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13151-further-complications/|6.5|Ryan Dombal

I don't mean that in just the spiritual sense, or in the way that people are going to be feeling his legacy for a while, though god knows I must've reviewed a dozen albums over the past year that were either in tribute to him or featured some of his beats or both. What I'm talking about is that he'll always be with us in the sense that the amount of material he recorded over the decade-plus before his death was completely overwhelming. When Los Angeles blogger and music journalist Jeff Weiss interviewed the Pharcyde back in May, Imani mentioned that when <i>Labcabincalifornia</i> was being recorded, Dilla gave them ""hundreds of beats"" to choose from. And since <i>Donuts</i> became the last album issued in his lifetime, it's been followed by a flood of releases-- sanctioned and otherwise-- that've raided his archives and spilled forth a flood of previously-unheard detritus that rivals the early-1970s post-mortem output of Jimi Hendrix.</p>
<p>Sadly, not all of that detritus has resulted in James Yancey's bills getting paid. His mother's been infamously entangled in rights issues with the executor of Dilla's estate, who has blocked the releases of more than a few projects that might've helped his family financially and brought some of his vault material to light. But <i>Jay Stay Paid</i> should hopefully circumvent that, since it puts a new piece of Dilla's musical legacy in good hands and creates a life-spanning statement in a way that previous memorial assemblages like 2006's <i>The Shining</i> could only hint at. <i>Jay Stay Paid</i> isn't a cash-in piece of vulturework, but a labor of love executive produced by his mother and assembled, arranged, and mixed by Pete Rock, one of Dilla's greatest influences. You couldn't come up with two people more qualified to help turn the DAT-stored scraps and sketches of Dilla's ideas into a full-fledged work of art.</p>
<p>The source material on <i>Jay Stay Paid</i> runs the gamut from 90s Ummah-era loops to beats Dilla was putting together from his hospital bed, but it stylistically falls in a general area that fits best between the dense but crisp boom-bap of his early-aughts material (i.e., <i>Welcome 2 Detroit</i> and Slum Village's<i> Fantastic, Vol. 2</i>) and the grimier, more frenetic beat-tape rawness of his Jaylib/<i>Donuts</i> L.A. phase. That latter aesthetic tends to permeate the surface here, filtered through a loose radio-show concept that interjects some actual disk jockey shoutouts, comedic asides, and brief interjections from the man himself. That bugged-out hyperkineticism keeps things moving, but it doesn't reduce the beats to ADD afterthoughts: Early scene-setting moments like the stuttering elasticity of the organ-riff loop in ""King"", the glowering Minimoog g-funk retrofuturism of ""I Told Y'all"", and the Morse-code keyboard of ""Lazer Gunne Funke"" don't run too long, but they sink in deeply.</p>
<p>Like <i>The Shining</i>, <i>Jay Stay Paid</i> breaks up the instrumental passages with a number of guest appearances by various MCs, most of whom either worked with Dilla in the past or otherwise have some level of simpatico compatibility with his aesthetic. Raekwon, whose upcoming <i>Only Built for Cuban Linx II</i> will also feature a repurposed Dilla production, teams up with Mobb Deep's Havoc in a pairing that might seem at odds with Dilla's conscious-rap-friendly Ummah/Soulquarian rep, but the skittering beat, skulking bass, and late-night creeping atmospherics in ""24K Rap"" fit them perfectly. And the usual suspects-- DOOM muttering acerbic wordplay on ""Fire Wood Drumstix"", Black Thought throwing around reality show namedrops on the Latin guitar-driven bump of ""Reality TV"", a host of raw-spitting Detroit cohorts from Frank Nitti to Phat Kat to Dilla's own brother Illa J-- come at it with the reverence and enthusiasm of longtime friends and admirers who fully understand the gravity of the project they're doing.</p>
<p>But <i>Jay Stay Paid</i>'s biggest strengths don't lie in its guest roster, impressive as it is. It's the way these reconstructed, reassembled beats so vividly show off how left-field he was willing to get in the service of finding new ways to make a beat knock. Hearing ""Make It Fast Mega Mix"" turn the spooky burble of David Essex's ""Rock On"" into a sinuous players' anthem for up-and-comer Diz Gibran makes it sound like an obvious idea turned novel, and anyone who's paid attention to what <i>Donuts</i> brought to the table should find some welcome familiarity in the vintage 60s and 70s electronics that flicker across large swaths of the album; ""Spacecowboy vs. Bobblehead"", ""In the Night (Owl N Out) - While You Slept (I Crept)"", and ""On Stilts"" provide the brightest examples. But even for diehards, there's something on nearly every track here that gives his production some strange, intriguing angle: swooping astral choirs (""Milk Money""), a bizarre, fuzzed-out and pitched-up mutation of the Mothers of Invention's ""Oh No"" in ""9th Caller"", and the closing statement of ""KJay and We Out"", one of Dilla's characteristic glowing boom-clap beats overlaid with a faint psych-soul guitar that might be the most elegiac beat dropped since his passing. This may not be the last we hear of some long-lost, recently-unearthed material of Dilla's, but you can consider this the most heartfelt eulogy Pete Rock's had a hand in since ""They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)"", and the definitive document so far from the family that misses him.</p></div>"|13152.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13152-jay-stay-paid/|8.1|Nate Patrin

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Mouthus are professionals. Not that their music is a full-time job, or is made out of obligation. Rather, Brian Sullivan and Nate Nelson approach every recording seriously and diligently, never bending their methods to fit expectations or pander to an audience. Often this devout methodology produces a glorious alchemy; other times it results in workmanlike exercises in sound excavation. But every Mouthus album comes with an implicit seal of quality craftsmanship. You may not find an epiphany in each listen, but you'll never come away feeling shortchanged.</p>
<p><i>Divisionals</i> might be Mouthus' most workmanlike effort to date. It consists of four equally thoughtful tracks, each dutifully exploring a simple idea. If the album lacks the sonic variety or magical moments found on classics like 2005's <i>Slow Globes</i> and 2007's <i>Saw a Halo</i>, it at least gives each chosen concept its complete due. It's as if Sullivan and Nelson decided to hole up in a lab and mix their basic elements in minimal combinations, until each fully interacted and dissolved.</p>
<p>Those elements remain flexible and strong. We get heavy doses of guitar drones and feedback loops from Sullivan, hypnotic clangs from Nelson's hybrid electro-acoustic drums, and something resembling vocals buried deep below. It's all wrapped in the duo's trademark combo of robotic repetition, microscopic precision, and messy, organic growth. The overall effect is like that of a metallic flower blooming into a statue and slowly rusting before your eyes.</p>
<p>Opener ""The Duration Myth"" sets an eerie tone, with moaning echoes and rattling percussion feeling like a faded film of an abandoned merry-go-round. The track slowly morphs into a free-rock jam, which Mouthus then hard cut into the backwards-loping groove of ""Rotary Sends"", sounding like the Dead C in a medieval dungeon. Side Two brightens things a bit-- ""In the Erase"" adds a lilting, flute-like tone to the roaring loops, while ""Telescoped Histories"" turns a march of buzzing bees into a bleeping video game.</p>
<p>To me-- a Mouthus lifer who was hooked the first time I heard their debut on a car radio courtesy of Princeton's WPRB-- all of this metronomic, heavily-textured sound offers little to complain about, and a lot to love. To the casual fan (hard to imagine, but I'm sure there are some out there), the album might sound solid but not particularly memorable-- a nice little step on a career path that has hit higher highs before and undoubtedly will do so again. But for anyone with ears, <i>Divisionals</i> is clearly another honest day's work from a band that always shows up on time.</p>

<p>Of course, there are some things to keep in mind when trying to paint this ""reunion"" as just that-- this isn't the first time Kittin &amp; the Hacker have worked together since <i>First Album</i> (with the Hacker contributing beats to <i>I Com</i> and <i>Batbox</i>), and the Miss Kittin from the turn of the century isn't the same as the turn-of-the-decade version. Just look at some of the song titles from <i>Two</i>-- ""The Womb"", ""Emotional Interlude"", ""Inutile Éternité"" (French for ""useless eternity""), ""Suspicious Minds"". And, yes, that's Elvis Presley's ""Suspicious Minds"" that the duo is tackling, and they're doing it in a straight-faced manner. Now given the ways and means of Kittin &amp; the Hacker, ""straight-faced"" might not be the best description for this cover, but if it's possible to do a techno'd version of ""Suspicious Minds"" straight, then by gum they're doing it as well as they can. Which is to say, not very well at all, unless you're partial to Eurodisco karaoke. Accouterments aside, the distance between Sinatra and Presley-- as heartthrob icons, pop music iconoclasts, or Vegas showmen-- is probably minuscule. But the distance between the cultured self-aware cool of ""Frank Sinatra"" (or <i>First Album</i> as a whole) and the oblivious earnestness of ""Suspicious Minds"" could be measured in light years.</p>
<p>It's a distance that's only accentuated by this record's superficial attempt to hearken back to the duo's glory days. But folks that kept up with Kittin's post-<i>First</i> output already know about the conflict between what she does best (the cooler-than-you kiss-off) and what she seemingly wants to be. On <i>Two</i>, only ""PPPO"" sidesteps that tar pit, mostly because Kittin's vocal input is limited to shouting four words-- ""people,"" ""pleasure,"" ""objects,"" and ""power""-- every so often. That the tune also features the Hacker's best block-rocking beat of the album doesn't hurt. But the Hacker's workmanlike production here can't save Kittin from herself. When she's given room to speak her mind, as on ""The Womb"" (""I am strong, and I'm climbing the social ladder on my own"") or ""Party in My Head"" (""I'm so small, I'm so not individual""), she sounds like she's trying to convince herself that she's one of the little people she once enjoyed stepping on. In tracks like ""Ray Ban"" and ""Indulgence"", she makes a vain attempts to reconnect to the glitz and gaudiness of <i>First Album</i>-era Kittin, and sounds even more out-of-step as a result. And only die-hard Kittin fans (or folks with a severe allergy to melisma and other diva signifiers) will find anything of substance to enjoy in ""1000 Dreams"" or ""Electronic City"". As the next step in Kittin's conflicted evolution, <i>Two</i> is not that much different from (or more enjoyable than) what's preceded it. As a supposed remembrance of the heyday of electroclash, it's a nostalgia trip that's best left untaken.</p></div>"|13075.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13075-two/|4.4|David Raposa

The band's follow-up, <i>Here Anonymous</i>-- again with the predictive title-- takes more or less the same approach, with a set of 12 songs that stick safely in the pocket of soft-spoken, dude-driven American indie pop. Take ""Day to Day"", which kicks <i>Anonymous</i> off appropriately, and cautiously: ""I left home, and I went out on my own."" Man, if Peter Walker's songwriting turns out to be a serial, we'll have to wait until 2013 for the <i>Toothpaste in Her Medicine Cabinet</i> EP. For now, however, we've got another album that leans toward the ruminative end of the emotional spectrum, but one also packed with punchy moments and crisp songwriting. And who's that? A lady?</p>
<p>Yup, on ""Two Can Play"", Walker gets up the nerve to talk to a girl, so to speak. He and Silversun Pickups' Nikki Monninger-- whose little-girlish voice is the perfect complement to Walker's cardigan-soft timbre, if you like very, very delicate things-- finish each others' sentences. When they harmonize on the chorus, they agree on the best way to resolve, not dissolve, a relationship, getting in a little jab at the same time: ""I implore you, talk to me now/ 'Cause you're wrong to hide it."" It's a unique song for Eulogies because there's a girl on it, but it's more singular because it directly poses an answer to a problem, without equivocating.</p>
<p><i>Anonymous</i> has plenty of moments with a pedagogical bent, but Walker's main pupil, as on the band's debut, is himself. The music sounds most energetic, unsurprisingly, when Walker's trying to convince himself, or us, or a woman, that he's going to be okay, or ""find my feet and walk away from here,"" as he promises in ""Bad Connection"". ""Eyes on the Prize"" rocks out to the extent that Eulogies will allow-- on Spinal Tap's amp, they'd register about a 4-- and along with ""Day to Day"", the album opens on an optimistic note, if not one with the familiar scent of a series of TMI Facebook status updates. You get the feeling that if he'd just stick to his guns and not water down his sentiments, he'd start getting somewhere: ""I just wanna see your eyes,"" he pleads on ""Out of Character"", which befits the song's vaguely Interpol-esque vibe. Then, a passive apology: ""Sorry that we let it slip away."" Active voice!</p>
<p>On most of <i>Anonymous</i>, he just sounds exhausted and unwilling to follow his own advice, if that's what it is. Despite its initially jaunty guitar tone and optimistic title, ""This Fine Progression"" is cloaked in self-loathing, Walker knowing in advance how he's going to respond to a recurrent situation, and realizing that he's helpless to stop it all the same. Even ""How to Be Alone"", a manual that, if it exists, I think a few of those reading this review would like to flip through from time to time, culminates with Walker admitting (within the album's best hook, it should be noted) that, well, he'd like to read it, too. If you have it to borrow.</p>
<p>While I was probably expecting more from <i>Anonymous</i> than I got from it, I'm not disappointed. And while Eulogies seem to have the capacity to do more than the limited playbook they've shown thus far, it's also true that advising the band to strike out in one direction or the other, musically or texturally-- listen to ""Progression"", then listen to Grizzly Bear's ""Two Weeks"", for one example of a similar aura done more effectively-- would be recommending they abandon just what makes them unique. They showed up, sure, but they'd rather you not come over and say hello, if that's okay.</p></div>"|13050.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13050-here-anonymous/|6.3|Eric Harvey

If Coldplay started out as one of many earnest post-Britpop bands in the late 1990s, they've beaten the odds to become one of the biggest bands in the world, the kind whose album releases become events and whose impact reaches beyond the confines of a genre, country, or audience. Coldplay are, in short, the kind of band that can give away a live album <i>gratis</i>. <i>LeftRightLeftRightLeft</i> is free to anyone with a ticket at their live shows and anyone with an internet connection at their web site. While I'm sure there's a suit somewhere tearing his hair out over this, it's not quite as ballsy as Prince giving away free copies of <i>Musicology</i> or bundling <i>Planet Earth</i> with the London <i>Daily Mail</i>. On the other hand, you might want to listen to <i>LRLRL</i> more than once.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Seriously, they could be selling this shit. After all, <i>Live 2003</i> got a full release complete with a DVD, and it doesn't even approach the confidence and dynamics of <i>LRLRL</i>, which showcases a band much more comfortable and commanding on stage. All the big moments they've tried to create in the studio finally come alive on these tracks: those tectonic shifts that push opener ""Glass of Water""; the mechanistic jam of ""Clocks"", especially when Guy Berryman re-creates the vocal melody on bass against Martin's cascades of piano notes; the communal grandiosity of ""Viva la Vida"". <span> </span>Despite a fairly conservative tracklist, <i>LRLRL</i> sounds like the band finally coming into its own, presenting as a live act rather than a studio band.<span> </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Much of the credit goes to the audience-- those thousands of fans singing devotedly along with Martin and exploding during the big moments. Maybe that's why <i>LRLRL</i> is a giveaway: The crowd may be legally obligated to co-billing, especially that woman singing herself hoarse for a few notes on ""The Hardest Part/Postcards from Far Away"". Here's a quick before-and-after demonstration: The opening lyrics to ""42"" are some of his worst, and Martin alone can't save them. But hearing him sing those same inane lyrics with a couple thousand people backing him up make that mood-setting melody sound pretty good actually. <i>LRLRL</i> owes its life to the audience, whose handclaps give ""Viva la Vida"" the sense of heraldry missing from the album version and whose insistent singing on ""Fix You"" defuses the song's Messianic rumblings.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Of course, the crowd can't rehab all of Coldplay's material. ""The Hardest Part/Postcards from Far Away"" is a middling piano ballad that feints toward ""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word"" territory but runs straight for Billy Joel. And ending with ""Death and All His Friends"", especially after ""Fix You"", seems particularly anticlimactic. Martin no longer has to cajole the crowd into participating, as he did on <i>Live 2003</i>; instead, the band seems utterly confident the audience will hang on every word and note. Even so, he does deliver some overeager stage banter. ""This is the moment in the concert when we show you how good our band really could have been,"" he says by way of introducing drummer Will Champion, who sings the short, strummy ""Death Will Never Conquer"". Champion does a fine job, sounding late-Poguish and completely at ease, but Martin's comment seems little more than hollow self-deprecation, only pointing to his reputation as the band's handsome, actress-bagging, Jeff Buckley-copping frontman. And just try not to wince when he alters the lyrics to ""Fix You"" and renders the song self-referential: ""five hundred meters from the band at the Coldplay show."" You can't touch the hem of his garment from that distance, but those are still pretty good seats.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Coldplay are the biggest band in the world because they believe themselves to be, which is the kind of titanic self-actualization typically associated with salesmen and self-help books. But they are humble in their hubris: Not only do they provide a service-- essentially giving listeners what they want-- but in this case, they're doing it without charge. Ironically, those contradictory qualities mean the band may be wasted in a studio, Eno notwithstanding. <i>LRLRL</i> suggests that Coldplay songs truly live only in vast concert halls and smallish arenas, where they are performed for, and arguably by, a captivated audience.</p>

But traditional pop music lingo never got around to anticipating the  downtempo, prog-infused strain of house music that eventually became  generally known as space disco. At its best, it's music that  throws you off by how calm and airy it feels on the surface, and right  when you're about to be lulled halfway to inattention, the rhythms  start to build on top of each other and the melodies start seeping into  the forefront and you're hooked. You have Norwegian producer, studio  wizard, and multi-instrumentalist Hans-Peter Lindstrøm to thank for  helping space disco evolve into its current 21st century  incarnation, and countryman Thomas Moen Hermansen (aka Prins Thomas)  to thank for giving it a serious foothold by joining Lindstrøm on their first, self-titled collaborative album in 2005. After the two  producers crafted some of their finest work last year-- the epic <i> Where You Go I Go Too </i>for Lindstrøm; a host of top-shelf remixes  for Thomas (including a staggering reworking of City Reverb's ""City  of Lights"")-- the timing's right for a full-length return to their  partnership, even if they have some triumphant recent history shadowing  them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <i>II </i> isn't a letdown-- assuming you don't count its lack of  immediacy as a disappointment. On the first Lindstrøm &amp; Prins Thomas  album, eight out of 13 tracks ran less than six minutes, and most  of them gave you a pretty good idea of where they were going right away.  Here, only one of the eight songs clocks in under seven-and-a-half, and the standard  structure relies on slow-build compositions that stretch out, decompress, and mutate; they don't so much segue from track to track as they melt  into each other. And while it might feel a little like a marathon anywhere  other than the dancefloor, there's more than enough going on over  the course of a track-- instruments warping themselves into new beats,  new riffs, and new melodies-- to give it a certain dynamism. Listen to a song  as a whole, and it'll sound like a gradual ramping-up from a simple  theme into a jammy, psychedelic expansion; listen to it again and zero  in on just the percussion or keyboards or guitar and that experience  will be brought into a vivid, deep focus. But it still works in a way  that never really overwhelms the song's driving rhythmic backbone-- light as some of it may feel, it's still dance music.</p>
<p>The first four tracks on <i> II </i>are more than vivid enough to draw the first-time listener in,  even if they defy easy description. Opener ""Cisco"" is the track  that has some people dubbing this L&amp;PT's ""rock"" move, but  its multi-tracked guitars chime and twang over a bongo-accented funk  groove with a tone that's about as close to the Alan Parsons Project  as Chic were. By the time it hits its full stride halfway through, drenched  in towering synthesizers and phase-shifted fuzztones, it's a sturdy embodiment of  what makes both producers such kitchen-sink auteurs. That momentum continues  over the next few tracks, whirring like an irregularly-orbiting satellite  around hyper-dense drums and Moroder/Vangelis atmosphere in ""Rothaus"", trembling and then briskly trotting beneath the wintry, shapeshifting  piano theme in ""For Ett Slikk Og Ingenting"", and loosening its joints  for the crackling energy of the shifty ""Rett På"", the most tightly-packed  song on the record; it sounds like there's about a half-dozen different  rhythmic ideas going on at once there, and they all somehow manage to  sync.</p>
<p>The last four tracks are a  little less frenetic, if no less involved. The final two in particular-- ""Note I Love You + 100"" and ""Flue På Veggen""-- are more than  24 minutes combined, and they  both hit an interesting nerve of  cross-era aesthetics, particularly in how the former features a mid-70s Fender Rhodes that slowly liquefies into a burbling new-wave  synth, and the latter fuses a disco drum machine with haywire analog  burbles, wordless vocal melodies, and crystalline chimes. You can kind  of imagine the ingredients for this album coming from a number of different  sources-- prog rock, krautrock, disco, funk, MOR pop, maybe even some  folk here and there-- but at this point there's just so much potential  influence it's hard not to hear the whole instead. And it's a hell  of a lot of whole, too: It's mellow and smooth and relaxing, sure,  but it's also unpredictable and full of little revelations and turns  of sound that make it one of space disco's crowning recent achievements.  If Lindstrøm and Thomas ever drop a <i>III </i> on us, it'll have a lot to live up to.</p></div>"|13064.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13064-ii/|8.1|Nate Patrin

But from blackjack to getting blitzed, the number 21 proves the rare exception. Even so, one wonders if <i>Luaka Bop: 21st Century, 21st Year</i>, a comp celebrating the awkward 21st anniversary of the Luaka Bop label, was as much a victim of circumstance as design. Luaka Bop spent much of 2007 in limbo, searching for a new distributor after V2 went under. Even once they were back up and running, LB releases were relatively few and far between. It took a while to wend through the backlog of unreleased records (Jim White, Kassin, et al.), and now that Luaka Bop seems to be back on track-- well, 21st anniversary it is.</p>
<p>Anniversary or no, in many ways every Luaka Bop release has been a celebration of sorts, of some great acts rescued from semi-obscurity (Shuggie Otis or Tom Zé), music rendered to the margins of the mainstream (its various Brazilian or World Psychedelic Classics comps), or global pop stars in search of a Western audience (like Zap Mama or Susana Baca). Putting its name and reputation behind these releases made Luaka Bop as important as any imprint in negating the need for the word ""world"" in ""world music"" and underscoring the qualities that all great artists share rather than their differences.</p>
<p>Yet it's hard to know just what we're actually meant to take away from the meager 15 tracks included in the set. They are a mere tease of the breadth and diversity of Luaka Bop's catalog, which over the years has given a home to acts as varied as A.R. Kane and Zé. If every Luaka Bop release is a celebration, this one feels a little more like a sampler, drawing from the label's dozens of releases for the most cursory and, by necessity, far from comprehensive of overviews.</p>
<p>The inscrutable Tom Zé is here, of course, as well as Jorge Ben, Marcio Local, Os Mutantes (""Baby"", natch) and Moreno + 2 (Caetano Veloso's son), amply representing quirky Brazilian pop from the past to the present. From West Africa, we get a funky track from Mali's Moussa Doumbia. We get a handful of unclassifiable songs from journeymen acts such as Shuggie Otis (the psych-folk-funk of ""Aht Uh Mi Hed""), Zap Mama, Jim White, Geggy Tah, and label founder David Byrne himself (his ""Fuzzy Freaky"", a rootless trip-hop excursion from the <i>Feelings</i> album). Cuba's Irakere, Peru's Susana Baca, and Venezuela's Los Amigos Invisibles provide a snapshot of Latin-American pop, while France's Nouvelle Vague represents provides breezy boho kitsch with its re-imagined de-discoed cover of Blondie's ""Heart of Glass"".</p>
<p>That song aside, just about every track on here is ace. But so are the albums and comps-- many trailblazers at the time-- from which they are taken. If you're late to the game (like, 21 years late) then <i>Luaka Bop: 21st Century, 21st Year</i> could be a starting point. For the rest of us, the disc underscores both how far we've come as music consumers (the deep waters of Tropicália or West African funk are much more familiar) but also how far the West still lags behind. Conspicuously, the closest Luaka Bop has come to shepherding a hit-- Cornershop's ""Brimful of Asha""-- isn't to be found on the disc, nor is the band itself. It's as if, so many years down the line, the label still feels compelled to place the emphasis on the less familiar, in the dogged hope that one day everyone will finally recognize the hidden-in-plain-sight riches around us and start filling their pockets.</p></div>"|13065.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13065-21st-century-21st-year/|6.0|Joshua Klein

His fate has been a mystery since February 1, 1995, when he left the Embassy Hotel in London. His car was found on Valentine's Day near a notorious suicide spot, but he left no other physical traces. What he did leave behind was his band, the Manic Street Preachers, who continued as a trio in his absence with his family's blessing. Sean Moore, Nicky Wire, and James Dean Bradfield have never quite left him behind-- his lyrics appeared on a few songs on <i>Everything Must Go</i>, their first album without him, and they've kept aside a share of royalties on the increasingly remote chance Edwards will return some day.</p>
<p>A few weeks prior to his disappearance, Edwards gave Wire a folder filled with lyrics and poetry. It had a picture of Bugs Bunny on the cover, with the word ""opulence"" scrawled across it. For their ninth album, the band has turned to this folder for one last harrowing look into the mind of their absent friend. Edwards' lyrics, slightly edited by Wire, feature on every song, and the album as a whole completes something of a return to form begun on 2007's <i>Send Away the Tigers</i>. The band was a bit rudderless after 1998's <i>This Is My Truth Tell Me Yours</i>, and <i>Tigers</i> seemed a conscious attempt to recapture a sense of direction-- the backward ""r""s in the album art intentionally harked back to the band's 1994 masterpiece <i>The Holy Bible</i>. Here, the throwback to their peak is even more pronounced: The album art is a painting by <i>Holy Bible</i> artist Jenny Saville (bizarrely censored by some British grocery chains), the lyrics are by Edwards, and the music, recorded by Steve Albini, is nasty and tangled, and they've even nodded to <i>The Holy Bible</i>'s use of interstitial sound clips from news broadcasts and movies.</p>
<p>From any other band, such a precise return to ground already covered might seem cynical, but these guys have never been anything but honest, and there seems to be a genuine desire not to let their deceased colleague's words go to waste. ""Peeled Apples"" opens the album with a colossal kick to the head as a queasy bassline is joined by pounding drums and sandpaper guitar to back Bradfield's righteous shout. He's always had a talent for torturing the words Edwards and Wire provided him into durable melodies, and it's no different here. This song, ""Marlon J.D."" and the hidden track, ""Bag Lady"", are musically the most hard-hitting things this band has done since 1994. ""Marlon"" opens with the walloping couplet, ""He stood like a statue/ As he was beaten across the face,"" and runs through an absurdly catchy verse from there.</p>
<p>It's not all bone-crushing hard rock, though. The title track has a clear-eyed rock jangle to pair with its heavy crunch, and ""Facing Page: Top Left"" is as gentle and quiet as the Manics get, bathing its verses about the beauty regime in acoustic guitar and a splattering of piano. ""Doors Closing Slowly"" rather awkwardly ends with a passage from <i>The Virgin Suicides</i>, one of a few cracks in the album's armor. The biggest is ""William's Last Words"", sung by Nicky Wire instead of Bradfield, as if to remind us why Bradfield is the band's lead singer. At just over four minutes, it's by far the album's longest song, and also its least memorable by any musical measure, though I imagine that, for the band, working on that one was emotional because of its lyrics, which essentially read like a goodbye to the band from Edwards.</p>
<p>Even if it were the desperate or cynical move some people have claimed it is, there's no denying that purging Edwards' old lyric folder has helped the band create its best album in a decade. Quite simply, they haven't sounded so focused or so purposeful in a long, long time, and they are at their best with a sense of purpose underpinning their music. The charge that it sounds like <i>The</i> <i>Holy Bible</i>'s little brother is accurate, but I'd argue that this isn't a bad thing at all, and I hope they find a way to build on the momentum they've created here. The little brother of <i>Everything Must Go</i> would be welcome, too.</p></div>"|13150.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13150-journal-for-plague-lovers/|7.8|Joe Tangari

Part spoken-word collection, part sociological experiment, <i>The Happiness Project</i> is the result of Spearin's interviews with his neighbors in downtown Toronto about the idea of happiness-- recorded responses that he then turned into music. What's fascinating about this collection is not only what the interviewees have to say-- Marisa thinks that being ""a good people-person"" is what's important, Vittoria likes school on Valentine's Day when they just get to make art instead of work-- but also the way that Spearin spins the cadence of their voices into tunes. Childish temper tantrum ""Ondine"" (""Not almond butter, Mama. I just want butter"") turns an irritatingly high-pitched kid's whine into a sliding violin melody bolstered by a delicate harp-and-piano foundation. And ""Mrs. Morris""'s proclamation that ""happiness is love"" is rendered as a be-bop saxophone ditty that matches the alto tones of her speaking voice with the sax's own cool, deep timbre.</p>
<p>The tunes on the collection appear as if by magic. You hear people talking, and then their speech is transformed into honeyed horn patter (as on ""Anna"") or galloping guitar arpeggios (as on ""Marisa""). ""Vittoria"", for example, spins a young girl's lazy ""like""s and ""um""s into percussive, brass- and reed-inflected bachelor-pad music perfect for a late-1960s James Bond chase scene. But the most moving of the collection's eight tracks is ""Vanessa"", which grows from a spare, reedy dirge into a celebration of twinkling pianos, sweeping strings, and sunburst guitars that mimic the vocal cadence of a deaf woman as she recounts the story of her cochlear implant surgery and its subsequent effect on her hearing and her life. ""People often asked me, over the years, 'What do you hear?'"" she says at the beginning of the track matter-of-factly with no music in the background to illustrate the silence in her head. ""I couldn't really answer because I didn't know what it was like to hear, so how could I compare?"" But by the end of the track, as she talks about the implant being turned on after the mandatory four-week waiting period, the instruments come alive beneath her voice, just like the sound that bloomed for her for the first time. The piano line is poignant and giddy as it imitates the mellifluence of her voice. ""All of a sudden I felt my body moving inside,"" she says, describing the feeling of her brain taking in aural information for the first time ever. The track then shrinks back to silence as Vanessa explains that her implant only has a limited battery, and so when it shuts off she actually experiences that lack of sound. ""Now,"" she says, after the last lingering piano note has stopped resonating,"" I understand the term 'dead silence.'"" ""Vanessa"" may be too fractured to be a pop song, but you'll be hard-pressed to find another recorded track this viscerally affecting.</p>
<p>The stories told on <i>The Happiness Project</i> are moving and ordinary and strange, and the way Spearin makes you hear the music of spoken language by translating speech patterns into notes is truly thrilling. But some of these tracks are better as stories than songs (namely, the noodly guitars of ""Mr. Gowrie"", which is a nostalgic tale from an immigrant far from his homeland where life was difficult but perhaps richer with family). And even the most moving tracks are still not quite songs. Spearin's experiment is fruitful, nonetheless, helping listeners hear the beauty of everyday speech and appreciate the happiness that comes from life's most commonplace moments.</p></div>"|13089.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13089-the-happiness-project/|6.8|Rebecca Raber

Sure, these 17 minutes are loud and torpid, easing from one note to another, distortion dripping from each new intonation. But ""Alice"" finds Sunn O))) exploiting a newfound spaciousness and elegance. As its founders, Greg Anderson and Stephen O'Malley, crawl across a loose blues progression that mirrors those of slow metal fountainhead Earth, a swell of French and English horns, violin and viola, harp and light percussion rises. Surrounding the guitars, they're like the perfect summer haze, refracting and softening the season's relentless sunlight. ""Alice"" ends with a fanfare of sorts for this small orchestra. Its long tones are light and lifting, a little like Stars of the Lid commissioning Igor Stravinsky. More <i>Fluorescent One</i> than <i>Black Two</i>, it's completely unexpected, mesmerizing, and beautiful.</p>
<p>Well, not <i>completely</i> unexpected: Like the rest of <i>Monoliths &amp; Dimensions</i>, ""Alice"" offers a culmination of most everything Sunn O))) have done right during their decade of volume-based plunder. Anderson and O'Malley have long rendered rock riffs with painstaking deliberation, consistently adding the ideas of elite collaborators and occasional no-explanation experiments. <i>The Grimm Robe Demos</i> took to early Earth, while <i>Black One</i> ground an Immortal black metal burst into one 10-minute tectonic motion. Merzbow, Xasthur's Malefic, Thrones' Joe Preston, and Mayhem's Attila Csihar stood among high-ranking contributors. Pieces like ""bassALIENS"" (23 minutes of electric bass tone exploration) and ""My Wall"" (25 minutes of Julian Cope verbiage battered by cascades of amplifier hum) ensured that Sunn O))) was doing more than swapping chords for feedback.</p>
<p><i>Monoliths &amp; Dimensions</i> takes the idea even further, gathering collaborators-- from Csihar and Earth's Dylan Carlson to Australian drone master Oren Ambarchi and vocalist Jessika Kenney, who sang so well on Wolves in the Throne Room's <i>Two Hunters</i>-- for four tracks that push Sunn O))) in directions unforeseen: Riffs come wrapped in strings. Conch shells share space with upright bass fleets. Both an operatic female choir and Portland noise nut Daniel Menche sing opposite the Mayhem frontman. All told, as on 2007's revelatory <i>Black One</i>, <i>Monoliths &amp; Dimensions</i> indicates that Sunn O))) and the possibilities of its slow music stretch beyond what we imagined.</p>
<p>About three-dozen people contribute to <i>Monoliths</i>' four cuts. Two of these tracks exceed 16 minutes, while their counterparts either approach or encroach on the 10-minute mark. It might seem that only size matters for Sunn O))) here, but that's just the surface. None of these pieces are big for bigness' sake. Rather, they all bear intricacies that erode them from within. A given piece's size becomes its fatal flaw. The strings and synthesizers ascend through the gaps in the sluggish riffs of ""Alice"", for instance, composer Eyvind Kang arranging the parts to crack and cover their host. By track's end, the guitars are gone, ruins eviscerated by a new growth of ivy.</p>
<p>Then there's ""Big Church"". The female choir led by Kinney, a four-guitar army including Ambarchi and Carlson, and the manipulated Middle Earth incantations of Csihar clash during three three-minute sections. The guitars or the voices invoke each third, and their parts slip by one another like the pieces of an amoeboid jigsaw puzzle. Csihar always overruns them, though, pushing each section into a chaotic climax. On ""Hunting and Gathering (Cydonia)"", Csihar cloaks some of the album's most literal lyrics-- ""They take the world and the earth, breathing fire on the endless oil seas""-- in his native Hungarian, but the music makes the message clear. Each time Csihar finishes a set of imprecations, a triumph of vocals and horns rises and exalts while the electric riff subsides. This is a new battle hymn.</p>
<p>And there's the album's other giant, opener ""Aghartha"". As close as <i>Monoliths</i> gets to the classic drone of Sunn O)))'s past, O'Malley and Anderson paw at chords on perfectly engineered electric bass and guitar. Again, a <i>de facto</i> chamber ensemble joins, as a droning Tibetan horn (the two-player Dung Chen) displaces the air beneath the guitars and sharp piano chords splinter whatever they encounter. These sounds sublimate into one drone, forcing the guitars out of the frame before fading into silence themselves. Only the sound of rushing water washes beneath Csihar's daunting voice, as he speaks of ""a tunnel [that] gouges in the shapes of the stream in the great abyss of the sky"" in booming, broken English. He's looking for new sparks to destroy the old order, for fresh energy to upset the established form. And that's exactly what <i>Monoliths &amp; Dimensions</i> does: It takes one of the world's most lauded loud bands and rearranges its game with an inspiring cycle of risk and reward.</p>
<p>Perhaps <i>Black One</i> came with a <i>caveat emptor</i> or two. You'd better like your music dark and relentless, and contextual understandings of Sunn O))) and black metal and drone helped. Lacking those things, perhaps you suspended your disbelief enough to appreciate Malfeic's scorched voice or, unfortunately, dismissed it outright as two self-serious dudes and their fucked-up friends dicking around with darkness. Incorrect, I think, but understandable. <i>Monoliths &amp; Dimensions</i> requires no such warnings. Per Sunn O)))'s long-standing dogma, ""Maximum volume [still] yields maximum results."" But this time, there's enough musical range and temperance to usher even the most resolute naysayer into this intricate wonderland.</p></div>"|13195.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13195-monoliths-dimensions/|8.5|Grayson Currin

He's an experimentalist, but rarely  an obtuse one, and he's created some amazing, enveloping music. On <i> The Glass Bead Game</i>, Blackshaw's guitar is, as always, a heavenly  instrument, but he continues to move further from the guy-and-guitar  approach that established him, bringing in more varied instrumentation. Piano, also featured on last year's excellent <i>Litany of Echoes</i>, plays  a far more central role here, and the record includes wordless vocals from Lavinia  Blackwall, strings, flute, clarinet, and harmonium, the last of these  played by Blackshaw himself.</p>
<p>The album opens with a stunner  in ""Cross"". Blackshaw's dexterous fingerstyle guitar playing sets  down a rhythmic and harmonic foundation as the harmonium drones in the  background, and eventually the violin and cello enter, alternately augmenting  the drone and splitting off to follow their own melodic lines. Blackwall  handles vocals, all of them wordless and odd and wonderful.  These include a harmonized rhythmic pattern and a drifting, languid  melody. The specifics of each individual part, though, are not nearly  so important as the overall effect-- these sounds blur together into  something transfixing, a nearly impossible combination of contemplation  and urgency.</p>
<p>Contemplation seems to dominate  the rest of the album-- ""Bled"" explodes in a torrent of brilliant  guitar in its mid-section, sounding more like an army of pluckers and  strummers than just one man. But on its edges, the piece is slow and  spare, as much space as actual notes. The other solo acoustic guitar  piece, ""Key"", is flat-out beautiful, with an almost religious quality  that's hard to pin down-- it sounds like it could  have been captured in a church. The two piano-driven pieces lack the  forward movement of the guitar-focused songs, in part because Blackshaw's keyboard technique lacks the subtly and deftness of his guitar playing.  ""Fix"" is very pretty, accenting a nice piano part with violin and  cello, but it's also repetitive to a fault and never quite gets anywhere.  A friend of mine respectfully but firmly called it ""Philip Glass lite.""</p>
<p>At nearly 19 minutes, ""Arc"" progresses from a simple, repeated piano figure in a sustain-pedal-down cloud of sound with voices and strings surfacing occasionally. It's an interesting piece of music, but until a small melodic phrase is introduced at the 14-minute mark, it lacks the forward motion he gives his guitar music that adheres to similar harmonic principles. Ultimately, the blur of the piece can wear a listener out. Still, Blackshaw's musical ideas are interesting enough that it's easy to see his piano pieces progressing as his technique comes along, opening another avenue to explore his musical concepts.</p></div>"|12972.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12972-the-glass-bead-game/|7.2|Joe Tangari

But this sense disappeared almost immediately as the core artists-- Sole, Alias, Doseone, Jel, and Pedestrian-- broke away into so many side collaborations that Anticon started to resemble a virus more than a movement. Over the years, they haven't so much expanded as metastasized, finding new converts (Sage Francis, Odd Nosdam, Dosh) as they splinter into smaller and smaller pieces and pursue their aggressively wayward interests. There are many possible explanations for this sort of artistic behavior (creative restlessness, for example), but it also represents a survival strategy. As Method Man once rhymed: ""Had to kill a schizophrenic nigga twice.""</p>
<p>It's a little surprising, then, to find the Anticon crew back together on their new mixtape, theFREEHoudini, especially considering it's being billed as a new release by Themselves, a name that Doseone and Jel often record under together. <i>theFREEHoudini</i> is many things, but it is not a Themselves album. Instead, it's a gathering of nearly all the forces Anticon have assembled over the past decade in one place. Slug, Sole, Alias, Busdriver, Yoni Wolf of Why?, Buck 65-- the gang is all here, and, as you might expect, the room gets a little crowded. For the Anticon faithful, the class reunion of the <i>theFREEHoudini</i> is a cause for celebration, but for everyone else, it makes for a jumbled and unfocused listening experience.</p>
<p>Sonically, there is nothing here to surprise you if you've paid attention to Anticon's last five or six years of releases. If there's a ferret hole of a subgenre to burrow into, they've found it by now, and their endlessly churning collage of ambient, minimal techno, IDM, and industrial has evolved to the point where the initiated can anticipate each hard left before it happens. It's still a place gloriously friendly to a comfy pair of headphones, full of babbling voices buried in the mix and drum hits so tactile they seem to stick to and then peel off your ears. The drum break for ""The Mark"" is swarmed by little insect clouds of electronics and a sandstorm of found sound, whereas ""Free&amp;Void"" seems to build its beat from the buzzing of a flickering fluorescent lamp. Whether slow or fast, the tracks emerge from a haze of analog tape hiss that suggests late-evening summer light.</p>
<p>The rapping, as is increasingly the case with Anticon, is just another rhythmic element in tracks striving to recreate how it might feel to do a lot of bad coke in a steel foundry. Doseone, who in a past life was a pretty straightforward multi-syllable spitter (see 1998's <i>Hemispheres</i> for evidence), delivers his lines here in a demented cackle that can barely be heard beneath the metal-on-metal cacophony of the production. On ""Kick the Ball"", Buck 65 staggers all over the beat with goofy non sequiturs like ""got a job at a church, and I rocked them bells."" On ""Back2Burn"", Pedestrian's verse bears no relation, rhythmic or otherwise, to the clomping music in the foreground.<br/><br/>The vets come off best. Over the loping backbeat of ""1 For No Money"", Sole packs his crowded stanzas with his usual poison-tipped misanthropy: ""This ain't a mixtape, it's an I-don't-give-a-fuck tape/ It's high-school revenge in a briefcase, who brought the duct tape?"" Def Jux guest Aesop Rock, on ""Know That to Know This"", spits something that feels shockingly close to a straight-up double-time rap over abstracted smears of guitar (granted, his punchlines still consist of things like ""Literally calling all heartworms back to the can from whence they came, jittery and drunk."") Frenetic, mercurial, and of wildly variable listenability, <i>theFREEHoudini</i> feels like a retrospective and a retrenchment of forces, but it also serves as yet another step in Anticon's breathless, never-ending push forward.<br/></p></div>"|13149.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13149-thefreehoudini/|6.6|Jayson Greene

Their first album approached different modes like a kid in a candy store, dipping into heavy riffs, hypnotic repetition, and howling noise, but it sprinted and lagged, never pacing itself as expertly as the band does now. <i>Psychic Psummer</i> is comparatively a less-immediate listen, but it is a deeper and ultimately more rewarding one. It's less of a wrecking ball and more of an assured roll, tumbling like an enormous slow-moving boulder through the band's diverse brand of burly and blissed-out space-rock.</p>
<p>As a mostly-instrumental album, there's a lot of tension and release in these songs, as well as healthy doses of repetition. But Cave continually toy with and subvert these familiar methods in ways that are as cathartic as they are clever. Opener ""Gamm"" bores through space with its reverberating vocals and windmill guitar strums, veering between explosiveness and a quieter, tenser lockstep martial beat, before ending on a lower-tempo sigh of relief. ""Made in Malaysia"" is a faster and more surprising follow-up, with a frantic Morse-code keyboard pattern that the band follows in vicious syncopation before bowing into some monstrous circular riffs. There's still a drifting chill-down moment, as with many Cave songs, but it's with a more nervous pulse, pushed by the occasional vocal provocation.</p>
<p>The loping beat, skittering percussion, and robot keyboards of ""Encino Men"" sounds as good-naturedly goofy as that the name evokes. The moments of release here and throughout the record are muscular without being obvious, and with vintage organ and guitar tones as dry as the band's mouths after some bong-delivered inspiration. Speaking of which, ""High, I Am"" ironically winds up a bit more straightforward than most of <i>Psychic Psummer</i>. Its groove is solid and taut and driven by domineering bass and toms, and squirts of keyboard and percussive weirdness make it sound like an underwater level of any 16-bit video game.</p>
<p>The band plays themselves out with placid Moog tone and loose drumming of ""Machines and Muscles"", ending in a simple, satisfying denouement. The album doesn’t out-freak their peers, but nor does it mean to; Psychic Psummer takes the creative restlessness of the band's debut a step further into something much more linear, and rides the line between the studious and the sublime like an act that’s been around much longer than a couple years. It takes an immense amount of structuring and sweat on their end for you to drift away on yours, and the result is so seamless they make it look easy.</p></div>"|13071.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13071-psychic-psummer/|7.6|Jason Crock

Label acts Caïna, Cobalt, and Wrath of the Weak alloy  the genre with others, puzzling purists and delighting critics.  Amesoeurs  are the imprint's greatest challenge to categorization.  This French band  surveys black-clad music from the past 30 years-- post-punk, 4AD, shoegaze  rock, dark ambience, black metal.  The mix is both logical and disjointed.   After this first and last full-length, Amesoeurs broke up due ""to  internal conflicts and different points of view about the band's future.""</p>
<p>Amesoeurs' debut EP, 2006's <i>Ruines Humaines</i>, practically forecast  their demise.  In three songs, they moved from distortion-drenched black  metal to Joy Division-esque starkness.  Black-metal shrieking sat uneasily  next to female cooing.  Guitarist/vocalist Neige held it all together.   In a previous band, Peste Noire, he played black metal.  In Alcest, he constructs an uncannily  authentic recreation of My Bloody Valentine.  In his hands, genres differ  only in distortion pedal settings.  Still, plumbing the depth and breadth  of multiple styles is difficult, and the darkness of these particular ones makes the task only harder.  Amesoeurs strive for Joy Division's heights/lows, but Joy Division were never meant to last.</p>
<p>On <i>Amesoeurs</i>, all the band's  influences are out in the open.  The clean tones are cleaner than ever;  the black metal is deeper and more depressive than ever.  This contrast  stretches the band thin.  ""Heurt"" bolts together the melodic  black metal of Wolves in the Throne Room with the softness of the Cure.   ""Trouble"" is straight-ahead, storming black metal; ""Video  Girl"" follows with the glistening jangles of the Police.  A  hidden electronic track at the end could be a Depeche Mode demo.  The band diligently  soaks its shoegaze sections in distortion.  But with so many detours  into blastbeats and the sparkle of 1980s Rush, it rarely redlines.  ""Amesoeurs""  is a glorious exception. Sticking to bouncy post-punk, it strings up  spiky riffs like Christmas lights.  For four minutes, the band finds  the common ground between Bloc Party and black metal.</p>
<p>This full-length is Amesoeurs' fervid last gasp of creativity. The album's artwork is appropriate:  Sounds like these could come only  from cities.  One guy in black runs into another.  ""Hey, nice t-shirt.   Wanna start a band?""  Music collections merge.  Last trains of the night  yield lyrics. Something  happens.  The band splits. They disappear back into the city, as apart  as before.  They leave behind this journal of triumph and heartbreak.</p></div>"|13063.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13063-amesoeurs/|7.0|Cosmo Lee

Offer a complete revamp of his paradoxically mist-light-but-brick-dense mix of ambient and trance? He'd be accused of selling out his smitten fanbase. Pack <i>Yesterday and Today</i> with six slabs of self-parodic more-of-the-same? He could await the entitled mewling about wheel-spinning and diminishing returns.</p>
<p>So it's unsurprising that Willner's taken the easiest route. <i>Yesterday and Today</i> calculatingly comprises three songs that extend the known rush of <i>Sublime</i>-- the barely there hissing drums; the short, soft vocal samples swept into grandly corny pastel clouds; the poignant you-call-those-melodies? abstracted from the emotionally-manipulative fakebook of post-rave cheese-- and three very different potential future directions for the Field discography. It sounds like a hesitant record, made by a man stuck between the rock of new non-DJ expectations and the hard place of an artist's desire to grow without being compromised by an audience whose needs he can only guess at. It's also quite good, despite the possible failure of nerve on its creator's part.</p>
<p>Good or no, though, it's doubtful the new-old stuff will convince those un-seduced by <i>Sublime</i>. Willner's tracks are so formally simple that's it not necessarily wrong to claim that if you've heard one then you better dig a lot of edge-of-perception variations in woosh and chug to get through a whole record. But then the rickety claim that ""there may not <i>seem</i> to be much going on but..."" has tripped up decades' worth of critics trying to sell verse-and-chorus kids on bleeps and loops. Let's say this to the suspicious: If the sound-qua-sound of a Field track's first minute doesn't trigger near-synaesthetic glee, it's guff to promise any mind-rearranging revelations five minutes later, or even many of traditional minimalism's ""holy shit!"" moments.</p>
<p>The length of Willner's tracks, their did-he-or-didn't-he? shifts in mood, and their easy to miss addition/subtraction of instrumentation via the volume knob suggest background music, and maybe that's the best ""in"" to the Field's world. You can certainly let the a trance-ish synth swoosh and near-inaudible plinky piano of opener ""I Have the Moon, You Have the Internet"" (a subtle advance rebuke to peanut-gallery griping?) wash over you and be satisfied. Of course that might mean you'll miss Willner's genius deployment of a single rising chord in the final minutes. And if you've been gripped by ""I Have The Moon"" for its duration? Well, there's your nape-tingling bonus.</p>
<p>It's also not clear that the aesthetic curve balls will please <i>Sublime</i> partisans. Korgis cover ""Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime"" is more or less a snooze, a looped line of (gasp!) full vocal over a dapple of static-ridden soft-pop and swelling strings-and-cymbals, a pleasant diversion as the B-side remix to an indie rock single, but filler here. Better is ""Yesterday and Today"", truly tweaking Willner's trademark and suggesting the fruits of the Field's cross-genre jaunt across America, rubbing shoulders with four-man bands in our finer rock-centric ratholes. The chunky, lengthy bass-and-drums outro thankfully sounds less like punk-funk and more like a tribal DJ tool from a Masters at Work set, albeit replacing MAW's gussied-to-hell layers of horns and chants with a nostril-dilating blast of pine-scented Kompakt ambiance.</p>
<p>But then there's the appropriately named, implacable, acid-tinged ""Sequenced"", a nostalgic cruise straight into the murky neighborhood of 1970s/80s Europe's half-remembered pioneers of O.C.D. keyboard-play as an end in itself. Despite the late introduction of a (there's sadly no other adjective) spangly melody, it's by far the darkest thing Willner's ever waxed. And though it features the album's most insistent rhythm, it's too slow for dancing, more like what a post-JDF producer would play during a casting call for his kitsch discosploitation movie. It's also the key to understanding why those who kvetch about the Field failing as ""dance music"" are missing the point. Like those repetition-happy German/French/Italian pioneers, the Field's making music more suited for passively-received images than actively moving bodies.</p>
<p>It's impossible to tell where Willner will go from <i>Yesterday and Today</i>. One might hope he continues on from the title track, adding weightier rhythms and making a few no-bullshit dancefloor singles. Or you can imagine a double-disc of deep-listening mid-tempo head-nodders taking ""Sequenced"" to prog/concept extremes. Whatever the evolutionary next-step, the hope is that Wilner can keep the <i>feel</i> of the <i>Sublime</i>-ish half of <i>Yesterday and Today</i> without stooping to third-time's-killed-the-charm recycling or willfully denying the pleasures he can provide so easily. That's the kind of tall order that's felled artists more time-tested than the relatively young Willner, and so for now I'll just wish him luck while very much enjoying the rich mix of retreads and possibilities we've got.</p></div>"|13142.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13142-yesterday-today/|8.0|Jess Harvell

""If you're like me, you're reading the credits right now!"" That could be a joke or a reference to Jay-Z's <i>Vol. 3</i> intro, but somehow it comes out sounding like an indication of deep cluelessness, especially as rendered in Cannon's imitation-DJ-Drama blare. (Seriously, they sound <i>exactly like</i> each other.) Nobody's ripping the packaging off <i>Gone Fishing</i> because, as far as I can tell, no physical copies of the thing even exist. The Cool Kids occupy this weird only-in-2009 unexplored territory in which they don't actually have to sell or even make CDs to score Mountain Dew marketing money or soundtrack <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yD3AnOOaDM"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Garnett's atrocious dancing</a>. They're an internet phenomenon, and that appears to be all they aspire to. And so <i>Gone Fishing</i>, a full hour of new Cool Kids music that they're offering for free download, should be a major event in the group's evolution. I guess. Maybe.</p>
<p>But <i>Gone Fishing</i> sounds like what it probably is: A collection of castoffs that weren't good enough to make <i>When Fish Ride Bicycles</i>, the full-length debut album that's supposedly coming at some point. The mixtape is a weird format for a group like this. Last year's <i>The Bake Sale </i>EP worked in part because it was short; a half-hour of their minimal, nonchalant mid-1980s revivalism is really all anyone needs to hear at any one time. <i>Gone Fishing</i>, by contrast, starts dragging before it's half over, the blasé fashion-talk and untroubled picking-up-chicks stories melting together into a bored-afternoon blur. The weirdly muffled and flat mastering job really hurts a group for whom crispy neck-snap snares are a principle virtue. As calm and casual as <i>The Bake Sale</i> was, the hooks had a sort of insistence that's altogether lacking here. And then there's Don Cannon.</p>
<p>Cannon is a beast of a producer and a Southern mixtape kingpin, but it's weird to hear him yelling all over a Cool Kids mixtape since his aesthetic and the Kids' are almost exact opposites. Cannon tracks like OutKast's ""The Art of Storytelling, Part 4"" and Young Jeezy's ""Circulate"" get much of their power from their soul-derived organic warmth, which is a million miles removed from the Kids' frigid empty space. He produces a number of <i>Gone Fishing</i> tracks in collaboration with the group's Chuck Inglish, and it's an awkward match, Cannon's shards of guitar clashing clumsily with Chuck's 808 ticks. And his constant headachy drops do immeasurable damage to a group that works best when at its most dead-flat simplistic.</p>
<p>But the main problem with <i>Gone Fishing</i> is that the songs just aren't as strong as the ones on <i>The Bake Sale</i>, or even the best of the various mp3 blog-bait tracks they've churned out before and after. As far as their punchlines, things never get much more clever than when they compare themselves to Launchpad and Darkwing Duck or more urgent than this: ""That's why we do it this way/ And it's fluent, nothing to it, let's get games of 2K."" When Ludacris and Bun B show up on ""Pennies (Updated Roster Remix)"", both past-their-prime Southern legends absolutely demolish the Kids on their own track without even trying. By itself, Bun's opening line (""I got a pocket full of profit and a wallet full of wonder/ A brain full of brawn and a throat that's full of thunder"") has about fifty bazillion times the rewind value of anything either Kid says here.</p>
<p>And yet <i>Gone Fishing</i> is a long way from being a total loss. Even when they're on autopilot, their icy flatness has style. There is, after all, a sort of compelling chilliness to two young rappers who never give enough of a fuck to raise their voices one bit. And the beats, especially the ones done by Chuck alone, keep every last synth-wash and snare-hit in its exact right place. When it comes time to rap over other people's tracks, they don't hijack ""Gucci Bandana"" or ""Day 'N' Nite"". Instead, they make use of the Art of Noise's impressionistic synthpop masterpiece ""Moments in Love"", which by itself is worth the five minutes it takes to download the tape. But if they ever do get around to putting out that album, the Cool Kids will have to come up with at least a few more ideas as clever as that.</p></div>"|13192.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13192-gone-fishing/|5.7|Tom Breihan

It's all raw emotion and strident self-affirmation, but the sentiment is presented without much context or concrete detail, which makes her confessional statements come across with an awkward, anonymous intimacy. It's clear that she's spilling her guts and needs to express herself, but even at her most direct, it's difficult not to get the impression that she is keeping herself at a distance from her audience. We may relate to what she is singing-- there is a good chance of this, given that she's mostly writing about general relationship drama-- but there is a quiet implication that these songs are all about her, and only her. This is not unengaging or uninteresting, but it can be rather uninviting.</p>
<p>Scattergood's songs tend to follow the same structural arc, building from fragile, ethereal balladry up to a highly dramatic catharsis, usually in the form of an enormous stadium-blasting crescendo. She allows some tracks, such as ""Untitled 27"" and ""Bunny Club"", to be relatively understated, but even her least bombastic cuts have an escalating tension, and convey a sense of desperation and urgency. Clearly, subtlety is not Scattergood's strong suit. She is at her best when she goes all the way, and pairs the potent emotions of her lyrics with unabashedly anthemic choruses. This is especially true on the single ""Nitrogen Pink"", which hits its multiple climaxes with incredible gusto without losing its essential, highly feminine grace, and basically sounds like Kate Bush doing her own version of ""Born to Run"". ""Other Too Endless"" hits a similar sweet spot with its sweeping, lovesick melodrama, and ""Unforgiving Arms"" tugs on the heartstrings with such ruthless precision that it would seem like a waste if it never ended up soundtracking a break-up scene in a romantic comedy.</p>
<p>But there are two big problems with this record. The first is that a little bit of Scattergood goes a long, long way, and her relentless grandiosity wears thin very quickly. Though the album is sequenced to separate the biggest numbers, the result is nevertheless draining, and it's all too easy to tire of the album long before coming along to the best tracks, which are mostly in the back-end. The second issue is that, while she does include some interesting musical textures on ""Nitrogen Pink"" and ""I Hate the Way"", Scattergood leans hard on cold, uninspired tones that could be heard on any number of bland, over-produced efforts churned out by major labels. This does not always derail her songs, but the sheer dullness of some of the instrumentation exacerbates the overall drag of the album, and takes the emphasis off of the more distinct and endearing aspects of her voice and persona.</p>
<p>Even with its flaws, <i>Polly Scattergood</i> is a solid debut, at least in the sense that she has firmly established her aesthetic, and has proved herself capable of excelling when at her most ambitious. It is not hard to imagine that Scattergood will eventually make much better records-- she certainly has a gift for melody and a fine singing voice-- but she's just not quite there yet. For the moment, cherry-pick the highlights from this album, and cross your fingers for her sophomore release.</p></div>"|13059.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13059-polly-scattergood/|5.3|Matthew Perpetua

The Sydney, Australia, quartet is among the longest-lived,  most prolific bands of the last three decades, but in North America,  they're pretty much known as a one-hit wonder for 1988's haunted, atmospheric  single ""Under the Milky Way"". It's really not fair because, apart  from the late 1990s, they've been consistently good, and LPs like <i>Séance</i>, <i> Priest = Aura</i>, and <i>Heyday</i> deserve to be heard in their entirety.  The band regained its bearings early this decade, and 2006's <i>Uninvited,  Like the Clouds</i> ranks among their finest albums. <i>Untitled #23</i>,  their ironically titled 23rd album (following their Australian  discography, that is), isn't quite on that level, but it's still very good.</p>
<p>The primary thing <i>Uninvited</i> had that <i>Untitled</i> doesn't is a big, sweeping single like the former's  swirling centerpiece, ""Unified Field"". But while it may lack an  immediately gratifying standout, <i>Untitled #23</i> is a satisfying  album, the kind of record that makes a big catalogue richer and more fun  to explore. While it shares some similarities with the band's blissed-out  late-80s/early-90s output, <i>Untitled</i> represents a distinct place in  the band's career, with slow tempos, languid vocal melodies, and a bigger  focus on keyboards than the interplay of Marty Willson Piper and Peter  Koppes' guitars. Drummer Tim Powles, with the band since 1994, keeps  things basic, opening ""Cobalt Blue"" with a steady  Bonham stomp and staying in the pocket from there. Meanwhile, bassist/vocalist  Steve Kilbey is in fine form throughout-- his old-school sing-speak  on closer ""Operetta"" momentarily fooled me into thinking it was  Bowie doing a guest turn.</p>
<p>""Pangaea"" seems an odd  choice for a first single, with its spoken vocals and barely there chorus,  and in spite of the backing vocals and violin that sweeten the song's  texture, it's ultimately not very memorable. A more obvious choice might  have been ""Deadman's Hand"", a guitar-soaked blast from the past,  stuffed full of breathy harmonies, that seemingly glows from within.  There are a few other moments of uncommon gorgeousness sprinkled across  the album, none more shocking or brilliant than the jazz-tinged guitar  solo on ""Cobalt Blue"", which starts off with a few completely counterintuitive  phrases before tying them back into the melody and has a tone that matches  the title of the song. The interstellar pound of ""Space Saviour"", the interlaced vocal lines of ""Operetta"", and the pulsing dirge ""On  Angel Street"" all reveal a band still full of ideas and willing to  pursue a risk.</p>
<p>One of the contributing factors  to the band's recent resurrection may be that they've taken complete  control of their music, handling their production duties and recording  when and where they want to, free from the kind of manipulation and  pressure record labels once exerted on them. The Church are still producing at a high level, and <i>Untitled #23</i> is a must for anyone who's followed them this far.</p></div>"|13062.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13062-untitled-23/|7.0|Joe Tangari

Monahans, then, had to go a long way to get some interesting drums  in their songs. Born in Dallas' Deep Ellum neighborhood before relocating  to Austin, they were originally known as Milton Mapes, a third- or fourth-gen  alt-country act with strong songwriting, decent harmonies, some casually  inventive guitars, and drums that were perfectly adequate. Feeling hemmed  in by the restrictions of the form (which seems to be the shared story  of most of the genre's career acts, from Wilco to Joe Henry to  Old 97's), Milton Mapes broke up, then the four members got back together  as Monahans, taking their name from a small town in west Texas. The  quartet had to shed all of its associations, including its collective  identity, to escape alt-country's tug.</p>
<p>""It's Enough to Leave You..."",  which opens <i>Dim the Aurora</i>, their second album as Monahans and  first for Misra, puts Roberto Sánchez's drums right at the forefront,  with a desperately steady beat that pushes the songs forward at a midtempo  that wants to-- but never does-- break free into a full gallop. Sánchez  is more than simply a timekeeper here, but an instrumentalist on equal  footing with the guitars: That tambourine puts the jangle in ""It's  Enough to Leave You..."", his toms ratchet the tension on the clockwork  instrumental ""Night #3"" and bleed into the mandolin strums on ""Over Fields"". On ""Fit for Fire"", his drums and Britton Beisenherz's  Bad Seeds-style bassline provide the latticework on which Greg Vanderpool  and Jim Fredley hang their darting guitar licks.</p>
<p>It's not so much that Monahans'  new sound allows for greater rhythmic presence, but that Sánchez's  elevated position in the group allows them to create that new sound,  to pivot in new directions. Bouncing on that drumbeat, ""It's Enough  to Leave You..."" immediately showcases their ability to write dusty,  concise hooks and to resolve melodies in interesting, unexpected ways.  Monahans turn ""Slow Burn"" and ""The Low Light"" into surprisingly  tender slow-dance numbers that echo any of Will Johnson's projects  (unsurprisingly, he sings harmonies on the latter), and the messier,  more abrasive ""Fit for Fire"" sets Vanderpool and Fredley's tight  harmonies against a maelstrom of horns and feedback. On <i>Dim the Aurora</i>,  atmosphere takes as much priority as songwriting, as the band makes the  music do as much as the lyrics.</p>
<p>But ambience is easy, and Monahans  occasionally use it as a crutch. The instrumental ""Terrene"" consists  primarily of guitar scribbles and half-hearted timekeeping, reminiscent  of Danel Lanois' dull <i>Belladonna</i> or, worse, Eric Clapton's <i> Rush</i> soundtrack. Except it goes on and on and on, finally fading  out after 21 minutes. In all that time, they never wander in  the path of an oncoming melody or really develop a theme, but simply  sustain an easy high-desert mood that's not compelling five minutes  in and even less so 15 minutes later. Most bands relegate this  kind of indulgence to the final or hidden track (see Neko Case's ""Marais  le Nuit""), but there's one more song to go on <i>Dim the Aurora</i>,  the slow-motion amble ""Distorted Signals"". It's hardly worth the  wait. In 20 minutes Monahans squander all the goodwill those drums  bought them.</p></div>"|13056.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13056-dim-the-aurora/|6.7|Stephen M.

It's as insane as it sounds. In the movie, Daltrey plays Franz Liszt, the 19th century Hungarian pianist and composer known for his flamboyant playing style-- hysterical women fought over his handkerchiefs at concerts more than a century before the Beatles. Whereas Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's music represented all things respectable and classicist, Liszt was a Romantic hero full of flash; <i>Amadeus</i> won eight Oscars, <i>Lisztomania </i>boasts lines like, ""Your big ambition was to stick your working-class cock up a piece of high-class crumpet."" With their fourth album, Phoenix reference both composers and hone in on an elusive target somewhere between Mozart's formal wonders and Listz's dramatic flair. While the album's 10 songs are arranged and executed with virtuoso pop-rock precision, they chronicle nothing but angst, confusion, disappointment, and despair. It's truly universal-- everybody live, love, and die.</p>
<p>Much of the album's internal conflict is laid out in its first couple lines. ""So sentimental; not sentimental, no!/ Romantic; not disgusting yet,"" sings frontman Thomas Mars on opener ""Lisztomania"", sounding like a madman with two tiny creatures whispering into each ear. Mars keeps this treacherous divide in mind throughout <i>Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix, </i>and the rest of the record successfully avoids mush while keeping its beating heart intact. And the issue of thematic directness is especially important to Phoenix-- this is an established indie band writing songs about love that are armed with hooks primed for a mainstream embrace. Just listen to the invincible crescendo of <i>Wolfgang</i>'s ""Countdown""-- especially that little Coldplay-esque piano twinkle about three and a half minutes in-- and realize that these guys are a few Chris Martin-isms away from staggering ubiquity. They're a bona fide ""should be bigger"" band.</p>
<p>But, as their songs tighten into increasingly effective bursts of pop, Mars is breaking up his words and meanings into smaller and smaller fragments. His isn't a self-congratulatory, indie-nerd triumph, though, i.e., Mars isn't being cryptic to be an asshole. He's getting better and more sophisticated as his band discards anything-- an outro, a bridge, an extra hi-hat hit-- that could be deemed superfluous. Sure: YouTube <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtRQsCgYmtc"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tells us</a> this album will make a generation-spanning touchstone like <i>The Breakfast Club</i> that much better. It'll also hit your gut if you listen hard enough. There are layers here-- maybe too many layers for the biggest rooms.</p>
<p>""I feel too young,"" went the hook on Phoenix's innocent and bittersweet 2000 debut single. Back then, the quartet was following a wave of Gallic cool led by friends Daft Punk and Air. Nearly 10 years on and this casually chic group has grown into something unique-- <i>Wolfgang</i> isn't a tweaked Air record or a tweaked Strokes record as much as it's a Phoenix record. Gone is the sometimes-flimsy blue-eyed soul of their first two LPs, replaced with a glossier take on the uptick guitars and sampled snare snaps of 2006's brilliant <i>It's Never Been Like That</i>. And they're not feeling so young anymore, either. ""Do you remember when 21 years was old?"" muses Mars on ""Countdown"". Growing up, looking back, and peeking ahead usually isn't this enjoyable.</p>
<p>Its unflappable sonic sheen gives <i>Wolfgang</i> some winsome 80s nostalgia, but smart modern touches-- a constant near-Auto-Tune vocal effect, Justice-lite keyboard stabs on ""1901""-- ensure its of-the-moment-ness. Meanwhile, Mars hints at a time and space where he's everywhere-- or nowhere-- all at once. ""Acres/ Visible horizon/ Right where it starts and ends/ When did we start the end?"" he wonders aloud at the end of the krautrocking epic ""Love Is a Sunset"", just after the song has blasted into a stratosphere where a diminishing horizon line is the only clear thing in sight. ""Rome"" likens a collapsing relationship to a collapsed empire; ""2000 years remain in a trash can."" And, on ""Countdown"", Mars' ennui reaches its peak as he sings, ""True and everlasting didn't last that long."" But he's not sad-sacking along, head down, no umbrella. He's pumped. Excited. With the band going full-bore behind him, he concludes the most ebullient song about existential inevitability in recent memory with an impassioned rallying cry: ""We're the lonesome! We're the lonesome!"" All together now.</p>
<p>At another point in <i>Lisztomania</i>, Roger Daltrey's entire body is sucked into a devilish princess' underthings. (Seriously.) Before that happens, though, the cigar-chomping heiress quotes Oscar Wilde while explaining her unladylike smoking habit, ""It's the perfect form of pleasure, it's exquisite and leaves one unsatisfied. What more can one ask?"" Phoenix seem to understand this line of thinking-- and not just because they look like a group of guys who know their Gauloises. They're pleasure-pushers, filling tunes with riffs, phrases, and beats a five-year-old could love. But, on <i>Wolfgang</i>, those same songs are unfulfilled-- and this band wouldn't have it any other way. There's beauty in a sunset. Phoenix are wringing it out.</p></div>"|13052.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13052-wolfgang-amadeus-phoenix/|8.5|Ryan Dombal

Mark Linkous-- better known as Sparklehorse-- would seem to understand something about trials and endurance. If any current performer has endured traumatic, life-altering experiences-- an early-1990s overdose that damaged his legs and almost killed him, several years in and out of states of severe depression and addiction-- while retaining an optimistic disposition, it's him.</p>
<p>In 2005, Linkous' friends tried to pry him out of a depressed state by playing him new music. One record that struck him was Danger Mouse's <i>The Grey Album</i>, which led to a mutually appreciative relationship between the two artists. Danger Mouse worked on a few songs on Sparklehorse's 2006 return-to-form <i>Dreamt for Light Years in the Belly of a Mountain</i>, cutting Linkous' delicate, hermetic songs with a new type of sharpness and color. In interviews for that record, Linkous and Danger Mouse kept dropping hints at a future collaboration: maybe it would be called Dangerhorse, maybe Sparklemouse. It would be something.</p>
<p>It ended up as <i>Dark Night of the Soul</i>, involving more than a dozen noteworthy musical collaborators as well as David Lynch, who signed on to create a 100-page book of original photography inspired by Linkous and Danger Mouse's music. As news leaked the buzz grew louder, and people were excited for a reason: <i>Dark Night</i> combined the best elements of a classic rock event with a very modern strategy. Links between the film, music, and art worlds were established, a ton of stars gathered together under the creative guidance of a couple of relative recluses, a regular old CD was marketed like a Hollywood blockbuster and packaged with a photo album for 50 bucks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it's even become a ""lost album,"" as well-- the victim of a record label acting like a lawsuit-happy killjoy. In the last few weeks, it came to light that the record was being shelved due to some sort of mysterious copyright claim from EMI (who weren't too happy with Danger Mouse's first foray into recorded music, either). Danger Mouse, who has emerged as the public face of the project, issued a statement that the book would thus be issued with a blank CD, ostensibly for burning leaked copies of the album.</p>
<p>This is one particular circumstance where a leak-- even at 160kbps-- is a net positive. This project, incomplete as it may be, is certainly worth ""possessing,"" in whatever form that takes. Linkous and Danger Mouse both have proven conclusively in the past that they know how to choose collaborators, and <i>Dark Night</i> is a well-sequenced and unique album that ingeniously balances its contributors' strengths with the overall theme of the work-- self-examination, often under stark circumstances, in the interest of understanding one's own existence.</p>
<p>It's not signaled outright, but <i>Dark Night</i> comprises four sections, and plays like a revue. Linkous has always feared putting himself out there too much, and seeming too ""pop."" It makes sense that he'd open this collection with a triptych from Wayne Coyne, Gruff Rhys, and Jason Lytle, all of whom frequently sing in Linkous-like registers shot through with delicate, boyish wonder and play with psychedelia in similarly rewarding ways. On ""Revenge"", Coyne works in a wheelhouse he's not seen since <i>The Soft Bulletin</i> and <i>Yoshimi</i>, evangelizing, ""Once we become/ The thing we dread/ There's no way to stop,"" in the form of a plangent ballad. For his part, Gruff Rhys works best at the level of empire, and the fuzzy psych-country of ""Just War"" could fit nicely on <i>Phantom Power</i>. As is his manner, Lytle's ""Jaykub"" traces an everyday schlub's dream of receiving official awards for simply being himself-- until the alarm clock wakes him up.</p>
<p>The middle two sections of the record are its weakest, but there are rewards all the same. Julian Casablancas' ""Little Girl"" opens what could be dubbed the ""punk"" section, his slick insouciance sounding strangely out of place eight years after <i>Is This It</i>, at a time when punk vocal styles have largely trended toward the amateurish and overdriven. Regardless, he's able to effectively register his everyday/macho character, nonchalantly singing in front needly guitars (and a rock solo!). It's followed by Frank Black's ""Angel's Harp"", one of the more forced-feeling cuts, and then Iggy Pop's ""Pain"", on which he ramps up his best, darkest croon, looking back at his life with a mix of regret and pride. The guitars on Pop's piece are strikingly reminiscent of those on the Magazine song ""Shot By Both Sides"", which is noteworthy because <i>Real Life</i> was re-released in 2007 by, you guessed it, EMI. The guitars are too crucial to the piece to lose, and Iggy's too big of a name to drop from this collection. Perhaps ""Pain"" is the reason for the forced abandonment of this whole thing?</p>
<p>Either way, <i>Dark Night</i> shifts again after ""Pain"" to its second psychedelic section, featuring David Lynch himself, another Lytle number, ""Everytime I'm With You"", on which he is completely resigned to just hanging out and getting resoundingly fucked up, and James Mercer. Lynch's ""Star Eyes (I Can Catch It)"" is a piece of muddy string-laden psychedelia, but Mercer's effort, the wonderfully titled ""Insane Lullaby"", is one of the finest moments on the album. Turns out that Mercer is as much a doppelganger for Linkous as Lytle, Coyne, and Rhys, and his cadence and vocal inflections are situated amidst a gently stunning cacophony of glitches, bells, and strings. He sounds like he's lost, but he also sounds like he's loving it.</p>
<p><i>Dark Night</i>'s best sequence is its last one, when Linkous reunites himself with Nina Persson, formerly of the Cardigans, and singer/songwriter Vic Chesnutt (both guested on the 2001 Sparklehorse LP <i>Its Wonderful Life</i>). Persson and Linkous split vocal duties on the country-tinged number ""Daddy's Gone"", the lovely, sentimental sort of ""pop"" that Linkous has always seemed so afraid of, yet is also exceedingly, seemingly effortlessly, capable of making. Chesnutt finishes the record with ""Grim Augury"", which, along with the Lynch-feauring title track, is a fitting one-two punch of rural eccentricity that allows Linkous to reengage with the woodshed hermit side of his musical persona.</p>
<p><i>Dark Night of the Soul</i> has been pitched as a marquee collaboration without precedent, which makes the mundane EMI copyright baloney that scrapped the project all the more depressing. But while Danger Mouse, Lynch, and the dozen or so artists involved with the project contributed their talents, the feeling I get from <i>Dark Night</i> is all Linkous. In genre terms-- punk rock, country, schizophrenic folk, psychedelia, space-rock-- the album neatly indexes his own discography as much as the overriding thematics do. It's fitting, then, that an artist who is on one hand so admittedly fearful of performance, and on the other has such a knack for collaboration, would make an album such as this, on which a group of musical actors present his work while he stands off to the side in the shadows.</p></div>"|13193.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13193-dark-night-of-the-soul/|7.4|Eric Harvey

Pinpoint the parties responsible, post-rave hero Guillermo Scott ""Prefuse 73"" Herren and drummer Zach ""Hella"" Hill, and you might expect <i>Ice Capped at Both Ends</i> to be a little more... antic. The latest Prefuse album, this year's <i>Everything She Touched Turned Ampexia</i>n, took Herren's cut-and-paste computer editing to a new extreme in density. And Hella have long been a lazy namecheck for critics with a plate full of spazzy 21st century noise-punk unknowns. That pedigree would suggest an album of virtuoso digi-violence, riffs, and drums colliding and crumbling faster than your ears might care to process.</p>
<p>Curiously enjoyable for a few surprised plays, <i>Ice Capped</i> drifts more than it jabs, built on low-impact, quasi-melodic drones and whispery indie rock harmonies. It may open with an agitated wash of cymbals and glitched-out voices, but ""pastoral"" is the easy-reach adjective that will likely crop up if/when the band is discussed. (Took me a few seconds after the album ended to realize the ambient bird-and-bug hum coming through my open windows wasn't some kind of unlisted outro.) As will the names of certain spectral-sounding, mimsy-voxed acts with zoology-based monikers, some of them also on Warp Records. (Naming names might be a bit cruel.)</p>
<p>Nearly every song sounds like the edge-of-consciousness intro to another, more-uptempo album that never quite kicks in. Given my occasional weakness for the two placid streams that feed this mood music, the stoned synth-slouch of 1990s home-listening post-techno, and is-it-live-in-a-quonset-hut-or-is-it-loft-studio-fuckery? new millennium gently freaky folk-noise, this uniformity was just fine by me. Fair warning, though, if you require more oomph or variety in your full-length records. I could happily avoid real-world responsibilities with the buzzing sitar-ish background texture of ""One Second Early Late"" for quite some time.</p>
<p>Those who've had enough of keening, multi-tracked harmonies-in-search-of-hooks and glassy more-reverb-than-guitar at a syrup-soaked 16rpm may gripe there's a hell of a lot of this stuff clogging new-release blasts at the moment. If you're burnt out, DWW is perhaps not for you. I do wish more tracks had made use of drums, like the half-speed (and then quartered again) scattered clumps of hip-hop twitches on ""Speculative Forensic Investigation"". And the gallop of ""Epedemic Episodes of Epedemics"" is a nice a reminder that art-rock-cum-electronic records can be as ""atmospheric"" as they like without sacrificing a pulse.</p>
<p>Drowsy but not unpleasantly so, Diamond Watch Wrists' debut will certainly remind clued-in listeners of other contemporary bands capturing a certain rustic ambiance and then electronically zonking it in post-production. But its rhythm-centric moments give it a little extra jolt of personality in 2009's glut of strum-and-hum. The twisted hip-hop iconography of their name may conjure images of last-call revelry, sticky spilt drinks glinting off showpiece jewels under club lighting. But <i>Ice Capped at Both Ends</i> is best enjoyed in the early daytime hours, especially those humid summer mornings when time feels warmly distended, its slurred downtempo mood suiting the pace of the world as it rouses itself, sun washing over the neighborhood.</p></div>"|13054.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13054-ice-capped-at-both-ends/|6.2|Jess Harvell

We're hoping to be a fly on the wall of their indie rock  domicile. And though those sorts of bands-- from Yo La Tengo and Low  to the White Stripes and Quasi-- release wonderful music, we are rarely  given an actual glimpse into the intimacy of the relationship that crafted  it. Viva Voce, a Portland-via-Alabama spousal duo, is one such group.</p>
<p>On their four previous records, Viva Voce gave us stomping stoner anthems  and warmly jangling pop, all crafted with an incisive eye for melodic  detail. But on their latest offering, Kevin and Anita Robinson have  not only pared things down, writing and recording everything for <i> Rose City</i> in less than a month, but built things up  as well, adding two additional members to flesh out their lineup. The  result is a fresh-sounding collection that feels easy and unpretentious  yet urgent, an album that is markedly different from its heavier 2006  predecessor, <i>Get Yr Blood Sucked Out</i>, but one that continues  its organic, imaginative bent. And though its songs may not explicitly  deal with life in the Robinson's marriage (sadly, there's no hit  single called ""Honey, Take Out the Trash""), they definitely give  voyeuristic listeners the feeling of a couple letting two new people  into their insular world and offer songs that pulse with the immediacy  of their off-the-cuff creation.</p>
<p>The album opens with a surprising wallop  of 1990s alt.radio rockness, as the glammy chug and reverberating riffs  of ""Devotion"" call to mind both the slick pop aggression of Garbage  and the theatrical guitar bravado of Jane's Addiction. It's strange  to hear Viva Voce trying on a guise that is, at once, so straightforwardly  rock (without any psychedelic or countrified influences) and polished  to such glossy sheen. But lest you think the entire album is going to  wallow in 90s nostalgia, the collection hits its stride on third  track ""Octavio"", when it slows down to revel less in manic guitar  pomp and more in Kevin's playful rhythms and Anita's  dreamy vocals.</p>
<p>Here, the key to Viva Voce's success-- long assumed to be Anita's guitar prowess and the interplay  between the percussive husband and his melodic wife-- is her  gilded coo. She has a limber voice that can wring the same sort of girlish,  sassy flirtation from its cords as Jenny Lewis or Emily Haines, yet  it's also adept at the sort of airy, hushed lilt that makes Chan Marshall  and Feist so captivating. And given the space it deserves, her gently  ethereal voice can become a track's guiding instrument, either when  harmonizing with herself (as on ""Good as Gold"") or melting over  the casual, deep-voiced delivery of her spouse (as on ""Midnight Sun"",  the spacey, 1960s-tinged track that features the loveliest guitar melody  of the entire collection).</p>
<p>The Robinson's country-ish work as  Blue Giant, another of the duo's musical projects, has obviously crept  into their songwriting subconscious, coloring the western soundtrack  guitars of ""Red Letter Day"" and the dusty cowpoke vibe of the surf  guitars on ""Flora"".  But Viva Voce smartly use such rustic  touches just as flavoring, never straying too far from their gauzy rock roots.  So though twangy electric guitar flourishes lurk under the warm piano  vamp of ""The Slow Fade"", its repetitive descending melody-- which  actually recalls an unplugged version of Nirvana's ""In Bloom""-- makes  it feel more like a rock'n'roll torch song than a rootsy barnburner.</p>
<p><i>Rose City</i>, an album named for  the band's adopted hometown (featuring a title track on which a homesick  Anita longs for the rain and glut of bands ""in the town I love"")  and recorded in the Robinson's new home studio, is the epitome of  ""homemade."" And that's a good thing. Created in mere weeks, it  doesn't sound fussy or fussed over, and manages the tricky balance  of audible intimacy without crappy bedroom acoustics. So for anyone  curious about what goes on chez Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, the answer is  clear: lots of music making.</p></div>"|13053.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13053-rose-city/|7.6|Rebecca Raber

Both members, Malcolm Middleton and Aidan Moffat, have gone  on to make music as good as their former band's-- first Middleton, on  2007's  <i>A Brighter Beat</i>, and then Moffat on his music &amp;  poetry album <i>I Can Hear Your Heart</i>, and now with his new, band-ish  agglomeration of musical friends, the Best-Ofs. His two principle collaborators  on <i>How to Get to Heaven From Scotland</i> are Stevie Jones and ex-Delgado  Alun Woodward, but it's an informal arrangement, and he's certainly  not averse to a little light orchestration here and there.</p>
<p>The album has a ramshackle  feel befitting Moffat's creaky barroom croon, with bits of accordion,  cello, woodwind, ragged electric guitar, and loud drums sharing space  in the arrangements. Part of the appeal of Moffat's songwriting is that  the relationships between people in his lyrics are as complicated as  real life, and his trademark storminess is tempered  with tenderness and humane admissions that blame is always something  to be shared.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking musical  moment on the whole record comes on opener ""Lover's Song"", when   Moffat's <i>a cappella</i> vocal, already interesting for the way he doubles  the lyrics with a wordless back-up, is unexpectedly joined by a human  beat box. There's nothing else quite as jaw-dropping, but there's plenty  of great stuff, from the tense drones and dense, cooped-up atmosphere  of ""A Scenic Route to the Isle of Ewe"" to the pretty, levitating  ""Atheist's Lament"", a song any unreligious person can relate to,  including non-atheists who just aren't into dogma. ""Oh Men!"" and  ""That's Just Love"" are celebratory drinking songs, and distinctly  Scottish-sounding ones at that. In fact, the Scottish character of the  whole album runs a lot deeper than just Moffat's thick, pleasing brogue.</p>
<p>Moffat always wrote about the  underside of life in Arab Strap, but even at his most woe-is-me moments  it never felt like a complaint. He's crawled further out into the light  here than ever before, and the  album comes off like a celebration  of life's complications and contradictions rather than a lament for  them. ""Lullaby for Unborn Child"" includes a recording of his then-unborn  child's heartbeat (it sounds oddly like war drums), and one can't help  but wonder if becoming a father hasn't brightened his outlook some.  It's on this song that Moffat's embrace of imperfection crystalizes  most vivdly: ""I can't promise you'll be happy/ But I can promise you  my best."" We get his best on <i>How to Get to Heaven From Scotland</i>,  an album any Arab Strap fan could love.</p></div>"|12894.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12894-how-to-get-to-heaven-from-scotland/|7.6|Joe Tangari

More than most any album in recent memory not named <i>Chinese Democracy</i> (please keep reading), it is compositionally and sonically airtight, every moment sounding tweaked, labored over. Perfection-- and the pursuit thereof-- has its price, and in less able hands (with all love to Axl), this obsessive attention to craft and execution could lead to something dull. What's perhaps the most remarkable thing about the truly remarkable <i>Veckatimest</i>, however, is how very exciting much of it is; no small feat for a painstaking chamber-pop record that never once veers above the middle tempo.</p>
<p>2007's <i>Friend</i> EP had me worried that Grizzly Bear's insistence on having everything in its right place had forced formula onto what had seemed to that point freewheeling and free-associative. For every inspired moment on <i>Friend</i>, there was another that fell back on the tried-but-true: a quiet intro bleeding into a big, harmonic midsection followed by an eventual denouement. That sound characterized a few of the better tunes on 2006's <i>Yellow House--</i> and a fair bit of what little Grizzly Bear has released since.<i> </i>That said, we've had no shortage of Grizzly Bear-<i>related</i> music: Dan Rossen's recently resuscitated Department of Eagles made a pretty great record last year, Chris Taylor's done some stellar production work with Dirty Projectors and Miles Benjamin Anthony Robinson, and the band proper have lined up onstage collaborations with high-minded sorts like Nico Muhly and the Brooklyn Philharmonic. In <i>Veckatimest</i>, one sees the fruit of that variegated labor as well; between records, these dudes have been busy getting better at all the things they do, and as it turns out, <i>Veckatimest</i> manages to do <i>Yellow House</i> at least a few better on nearly every metric.</p>
<p>First, the songs. By now, many of you should be familiar with the stunning bounce of ""Two Weeks"", the skyward swoon of teen creeper ""Cheerleader"", and the surefooted shuffle of ""While You Wait for the Others"". (In fact, I'm painfully aware you may just be intimately familiar with the whole damn thing. If that's you, listen good: that windtunnel 128k leak you nabbed that fateful night back in March? That is not <i>Veckatimest</i>. Get thee to a buying place.) Highlights, all, but there's more where that came from. The fluttering opener ""Southern Point"" takes off and circles back like a flock of birds, as inviting as <i>Yellow House</i>'s ""Easier"" and a whole lot more to the point. The Rossen-sung ""All We Ask"" does the Rossen thing, starting soft and slow before exploding around the halfway mark, but it does it as well as or better than anything we've heard from him before. The record's final stretch, from ""While You Wait"" through the head-swimmer ""I Live With You"" to the masterful, muted ""Foreground"" closes <i>Veckatimest</i> on three very strong notes.</p>
<p>But this is Grizzly Bear, and despite an increased confidence in their pop sensibilities and an overall strengthening of melodies, they're still meanderers at heart. Highlights abound, but <i>Veckatimest</i> does sound as though it was conceived as a whole piece, and one must consider both the overall structure and the connective tissue between the abundant highlights to judge it a success. Save ""Cheerleader""  and the lilting ""Ready, Able"", the stretch between ""Fine for Now"" and ""While You Wait"" wanders a bit; certain moments, like Rossen's ""swim around like two dories"" line and the wispy, wheezing ""About Face"", hit harder than others. But you'll be looking for a while to find anybody who thinks the center of <i>Veckatimest</i> is as strong as the stuff surrounding it.</p>
<p>Beyond irking folks predisposed to slagging off intricate and, yeah, ""sophisticated"" music like this-- you stay punk, I'mma stay fascinated-- this trip down yonder to the minor key will doubtless be the big complaint about <i>Veckatimest</i>. But really, couldn't we say the same about <i>Yellow House</i>? I mean, there's some jam in between ""Knife"" and ""On a Neck, On a Spit"", but there's an awful lot of wide-open spaces and deliberate left turns in there, too. <i>Yellow House</i> was not a record defined so much by its two or three big numbers as it was by the slightly haunting impression it left when you played it front to back; it sounded deconstructed, whereas <i>Veckatimest</i> feels built brick-by-brick. As I mentioned, <i>Veckatimest</i> handily beats<i> Yellow House</i> in the bangers department, and while you're not gonna hear ""Two Weeks"" on any radio station that isn't already playing Ted Leo, there is something prim and proper about the record. Yet the pop moments on <i>Veckatimest</i> feel even bigger after the slight deviation at its core; surrounded by a few sour notes and sidesteps, ""Cheerleader"" and ""Ready, Able"" becomes that much stronger, and even the less effective numbers (""Hold Still"", ""Fine for Now"") seem only to cower a smidge as a result of the staggering heights they're placed next to. Out of context, they're every bit as good as the more sinewy stuff that wove <i>Yellow House</i> together.</p>
<p>I walked into Grizzly Bear's much-lauded set at the church down at SXSW this year a skeptic and came out a convert; I knew what a powerful live band they could be, having seen 'em twice before, but my fear about flatlining and my initial (and incorrect) impressions based on the <i>Veckatimest</i> leak had me convinced I'd get my ""Knife"" and my ""Two Weeks"" and then perhaps a very welcome nap. What I got instead was as great a testament to band democracy as I've seen onstage; these new tunes require a terrific amount of concentration and skill to pull off in that setting, and any band whose sprightliest number (""On a Neck"", still) sounds like half a ragtime had to work awfully hard to win me over after I'd spent the prior eight hours replacing beer-sweat with more beer. Yeah, <i>Veckatimest</i> sounds worked-over, but in the best of ways; carefully embellished, stripped bare when applicable, full of the joy of sounds colliding with other sounds. Grizzly Bear was once Ed Droste's band, but no longer; it's a family affair, and only four guys so completely serious about music-making could come together to make an album this labor-intensive sound so airy, so natural.</p>
<p>I get it; Grizzly Bear can come across to some as boring. Lord knows I could go my whole life never reading another Ed Droste Tweet about pho or seeing Chris Taylor use a neti pot. But this little microcosm of imperfection indie rock's been working through lately could use a foil like <i>Veckatimest</i>, a record that, in searching for perfection through meticulousness, feels beautifully flawed and gloriously off-kilter without either side serving as the entire narrative. Really, in a world far too concerned with backstories and far too lacking in good old dedication to craft, Grizzly Bear's just about as boring as they come: four guys who very quietly set out to make a fantastic record. And so they did.</p></div>"|13078.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13078-veckatimest/|9.0|Paul Thompson

Delivered by Pimp C, these are among the first words you hear on <i>UGK 4 Life</i>, and unfortunately, it's a sentiment delivered way less metaphorically than we're used to. Lives are cut short with a sad frequency in hip-hop, but Pimp C's early death was something of an anomaly: too often, ascendant talents are snuffed out before we get a full glimpse of their capabilities. But by 2007, UGK had become something like Houston's answer to Gang Starr, a partnership that thrived on consistency and longevity while their peer groups either broke up, soldiered on in an unknowable format, or just fell the fuck off completely (I'm looking at you 8Ball &amp; MJG).</p>
<p>So, yeah-- <i>UGK 4 Life</i> doesn't dwell a whole lot on what the future holds in large part because it's so steeped in the craft they took years to perfect. Though it lacks something as jump-off-the-screen as ""Int'l Players Anthem"" and the feel-good momentousness of a #1 debut on Billboard, it also lacks double-album stuffing filler. Though probably not the best UGK album, it might be the strongest illustration of what they do best. As with most of their material, the vast majority of the <i>UGK 4 Life</i>'s action takes place behind a woodgrain wheel, in the vicinity of a pistol, or inside various female orifices, with only the incredibly ill-advised Akon spot about erectile function (""Hard as Hell"") to fuck up the flow. Of course, there are still plenty State of the Streets sermons, as ""Purse Come First"" makes the latent political awareness in Bun B's raps come to the forefront (""it's a new world order, at least that's what I read""). But even if Pimp C opened up about his image (""I look like this, I don't talk it/ I make 'em think I'm dumb""), he still ended his verse with a blowjob joke.</p>
<p>While UGK's albums have always delivered, I never quite shared the opinion that they're godbody MC's. For me, there's not enough clever wordplay and not enough detailed storytelling-- basically that whole East Coast bias bullshit. But maybe due to the proliferation of Kanye-jacking newbies who used to rap and now wanna sing, I've come to appreciate UGK as having two of the best voices in hip-hop. It's a dynamic that's been explored over-and-over-- the deeper, more methodical cadence balancing out the nasal loose cannon. Bun B's performance is a masterwork of nuance here, sounding doubled even when it's obvious he's not. His oaken, sturdy intonations give authority to anything he's saying, whether introspective (""The Pimp and the Bun"") or just stuck on the same ol' bullshit (just about everything else). As for Pimp C, it's easy to point out that nearly all of his metaphors on this record are food-based and related to him getting his dick sucked, but he remains untouched in terms of delivering hooks and his mere accent can still be the highlight of any track. Just check ""She Luv It"" for the incomprehensible pronunciation of ""barbecue rib,"" wherein the former word has fewer syllables than the latter, or the entirety of ""Everybody Wanna Ball"", where he takes an obvious line and flips into a spirited performance on his own terms.</p>
<p>There's also a nice ""Eh, why not?"" feel to the guest list: there's Akon, Ronald Isley, B-Legit, and E-40, but also Snoop and Too $hort (guess what the song they're on is about) and even commercial non-starters like Big Gipp. The common thread through all of them here is that they're all on UGK territory, and they don't get beats so much as music, steaming organ trills and wah-wah guitar filling out the backdrop and rendering even the most smutty material sultry. The delightfully nasty ""She Luv It"" could even be a hit if it didn't begin with Pimp C trying ""to fit [my] whole dick and nuts inside your mooooouth"" and end with his advice on female grooming. Same for ""Harry Asshole"", which raises the question of how it could be filthier than its title and answers with ""feat. Lil' Boosie and Webbie.""</p>
<p>Is it weird for <i>UGK 4 Life</i> to make pretty much no mention whatsoever of the fact that half of the rapping is done by someone who died a year and a half before its release? A little-- Sleepy Brown gets himself off the milk carton to propose a toast to Pimp during the ice-grilled rumination of ""Swishas &amp; Erb"" (possibly a nod to OutKast's similar-sounding ""Crumblin' Erb""), and only then do you realize it's the only Bun B solo performance on the whole thing. But UGK never seemed like the type to buy into a whole lot of self-mythologizing, maudlin or otherwise. You'd expect something of that sort from the penultimate ""Da Game Been Good to Me"", but instead it might as well be subtitled ""But Not to You"", as Pimp and Bun talk down rappers who failed to respect the game like they did. It makes sense: As long as there's grain to be gripped, lanes to be switched, and, for better or worse, way too many words that rhyme with ""bitch,"" UGK's music remains timeless in its own way.</p></div>"|13073.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13073-ugk-4-life/|7.9|Ian Cohen

They have their own typeface, side  projects (frontman Tobacco's 2008 album <i>Fucked Up Friends</i>),  split EPs, and an enclave (Pittsburgh). Yet now <i>Eating Us,</i> the band's fourth album, emerging from undisclosed Pennsylvania woodland recording sessions to roost in producer Dave Fridmann's Tarbox Road Studios, the band's first professional recording experience. The result is a crisper, more linear sound that, somewhat surprisingly, places substantial emphasis on the band's songwriting.</p>
<p>Whether a conscious choice or a byproduct  of Fridmann's noted, um, flattening tendencies, <i>Eating Us</i> is  less reliant on the analog bass rumble featured prominently on <i> Dandelion Gum</i>.  The beats, while still machinated and tweaked,  seem more attuned to rock norms, popping reliably on the 2s and 4s.   Analog-y synth noise still gobbles space, but the filters and oscillators  no longer wild off in strange directions; they are musical instruments,  making music.  The vocals still exclusively feature vocoder  effects, but the sugar-swamp flow is less molasses, more maple syrup.   The lyrics are still rightly fucked-- ""Iron lemonade/ Wash my friends  away/ Na, na na na na na""-- but they're mostly decipherable.</p>
<p>These aren't necessarily backward steps: Album opener ""Born on a Day the Sun Didn't Rise""-- possibly the first linear BMSR song-- moves like  an Elephant 6 track.  Choppy, descending chords,  boxy drums, and citric acid-vocals push toward a bridge featuring, of  all things, a string section.  The industrial distortion that congeals  near the end of ""Iron Lemonade"" has guitar lines wrapped around  it like yarn, and the whole song benefits from its taut, careful groove.   A banjo lopes throughout ""American Face Dust""; ""Twin of Myself""  might have a real chorus.</p>
<p>BMSR are still appropriately weird--  ""Wash my friends away"" is a <i>request</i>.  But they're  also gentler, more coherent.  Close your eyes and place ""Twin  of Myself"" against any of the songs you might have forgotten from <i> At War With the Mystics</i>.   The gentle sighs and acoustic  guitars of ""Bubblegum Animals"" and ""Fields Are Breathing"" feel  pastoral, a label that seems slight in the shadow of BMSR's forest-groove  madness.   Songs tend to be followed by... more songs, and  not the rippling Moog-fevers that often threatened <i>Dandelion Gum</i> (there is no ""Caterpillar House"", no ""Rollerdisco"").  Damn  if ""Gold Splatter"", at four-plus minutes and the recipient of a  string outro, doesn't just feel long.</p>
<p><i>Dandelion Gum</i> exhibited the  sort of singular style that incites folks to think, about its creators,  that they could make records like this for the rest of their career.   But maybe not; <i>Dandelion Gum</i> was speckled and silly and high  as shit.  <i>Eating Us</i> feels more like the baseline: collected,  repeatable, respectable.  You know, regular, at least to the point  that melting faces and ""fucked-up dreams"" can be regular.</p></div>"|13048.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13048-eating-us/|6.1|Andrew Gaerig

But love them or hate them, no one could ever fairly accuse the group of caving in to critics and abandoning their mission. Indeed, the Mars Volta's main drivers, Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and Cedric Bixler-Zavala, are like id-mobiles stuck permanently in high gear; they'd rather hit a brick wall head on than back up or turn around, to hell with anyone that would suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>Even so, the last thing the ADHD-inclined group would appear to need is another distraction. But apparently Omar Rodriguez-Lopez's scattershot ideas and energies can't be contained in, let alone sated by, one band alone. Since the inception of the Mars Volta, he's kept himself busy with any number of collaborations and side projects, working with such fellow travelers as Lydia Lunch, Damo Suzuki, and Chili Pepper John Frusciante, and releasing a never-ending stream of discs under his own name as well as the Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Quintet.</p>
<p>El Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, as the name implies, is the newest Omar Rodriguez-Lopez project, except that it's really not that new. El Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez-Lopez began back in 2006 when Omar Rodriguez-Lopez hooked up with Hella drummer Zach Hill but has since evolved to include fellow Hella member Jonathan Hischke as well as other members of the Mars Volta, including vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala. For fans of both the Mars Volta and Hella, one imagines news of the collaboration portended the ultimate meeting of the out-of-their-minds.</p>
<p>That <i>Cryptomnesia</i> sounds more or less exactly like the sum of its parts should shock no one. The first publicly released product of the Mars Volta/Hella collision (with supposedly at least two other completed recordings waiting in the wings), <i>Cryptomnesia</i> features about 36 minutes of Rodriguez-Lopez's trademark guitar ejaculations, supported by Hill's thundering, hyperactive drums, with Bixler-Zavala's histrionic vocals piercing the din on nine of the 11 tracks.</p>
<p>On the plus side, the bulk of the tracks barely reach the four-minute mark, tempering Rodriguez-Lopez's tendency to wank around until he runs out of time or tape (whichever comes first). A few songs, such as ""Half Kleptos"" and ""Paper Cunts"", even attain some semblance of a groove. Yet between all the samples of dialog interspersed throughout the disc and film-referencing song titles such as ""Noir"", ""They're Coming to Get You, Barbara"", and ""Warren Oates"", the album recalls less the prog dinosaurs that the Mars Volta are always compared to and more John Zorn's crazed hardcore cartoon jazz outfit Naked City.</p>
<p>Except Naked City at least had a sense of humor and kept the changes coming so fast and furious it was easy to get caught up in the frantic nature of it all. El Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, on the other hand, don't favor such concision, and, breaks between outbursts such as the aforementioned ""Cunts"", ""Elderly Pair Beaten With Hammer"", and ""Warren Oates"" aside, they essentially amount to variations on the same song, one long suite that might as well be a single track. Admittedly, one man's indulgence is another man's ambition, but not only does it sound at this point as if Rodriguez-Lopez can barf out stuff like this in his sleep, but at his rate of productivity he may be doing just that. Awe is in the ear of the beholder, sure, but after being predictably pounded into the ground for half an hour by Rodriguez-Lopez/Hill et al. and their bag of heavy tricks, it's hard to tell if we're meant to walk away impressed or oppressed.</p></div>"|13031.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13031-cryptomnesia/|4.8|Joshua Klein

Over the past year, noise-pop has seen a vast resurgence, growing in popularity in ways most of us didn't anticipate. And with so many of this year's most talked-about artists (Wavves, the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, and others) adding varying degrees of murk to pop melodies, it's getting harder to separate the wheat from the chaff. Though they've toned down their approach ever so slightly with sophomore LP <i>Wild and Inside</i>, Eat Skull remains the scuzziest of all, and shows us here why they're still one of the most intriguing acts operating in this style.</p>
<p>To say that <i>Wild and Inside</i> sounds ""clean"" would be a stretch, but what's immediately noticeable here is the album's lack of excessive noise, the squeals and screeches that dominated so much of <i>Sick to Death</i>. Eat Skull (and frontman Rob Enbom, in particular) seem to have matured as songwriters and they're more capable of using noise as a tool, another instrument, rather than relying on it as the sole foundation for their material. That much is clear on the record's decidedly poppy front- and back-ends. Stellar opener ""Stick to the Formula"" and neighboring ""Heaven's Stranger"" strike a fine balance between 1960s garage-rock and the sugariness of early Flying Nun acts the Clean and the Chills, adding a uniquely crusty, folksier quality that lends the songs distinctiveness.</p>
<p>This shift towards pop (and again, that's a relative term here) gives the band more room to breathe. It lets them tinker with other styles, too, and most of this experimenting takes place in the record's quirky midsection. Eat Skull daringly ventures into a stretch of haunted Americana here and manages to pull it off; they wind up sounding like a spookier version of fellow lo-fi crusties Woods-- not a bad thing. Unexpected detours really open up on third or fourth listen (<i>Wild and Inside</i> is undoubtedly a grower); tracks such as the funereal ""Talkin' Bro in the Wall Blues"" display a welcome adventurousness not found on <i>Sick to Death</i>. Similarly surprising (and appealing) is the ominous coastal instrumental ""Surfing the Stairs"" and ""Happy Submarine"", which plays like a psych-garage reimagining of Grouper's from-the-bottom-of-a-well shoegaze.</p>
<p>Just a few patches of <i>Wild and Inside</i> aren't as successful. It's hard to imagine many folks loving the minimal dirge ""You're With a Thing"", which subsists mostly on a simple drum-machine beat and organ squelches. And other times Eat Skull's penchant for quirkiness borders on kitsch, like on ""Cooking Our Way to Be Happy"", a track about, well, cooking. (A cute song, sure, but lacking the staying power of catchy late-album standouts ""Dawn in the Face"" and ""Oregon Dreaming"".) Such lapses are few and far between, though, and shouldn't spoil much one's enjoyment of the album. The real question, I suppose, is whether or not listeners will give this record the room it needs to develop, or if kids new to this wave of noise-pop will make the jump to Eat Skull's much weirder sub-strain. It's hard to say: We Twitter-era fans are generally a pretty fatigued and impatient bunch. Those who do carve out some time for <i>Wild and Inside</i>, though, are likely in for a treat.</p></div>"|13051.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13051-wild-and-inside/|7.6|Joe Colly

Really. Mostly because I was a Green Day fan, but also because of the soul-numbing run-up to the 2004 U.S. presidential election, one of those rare moments when even those wary of politicized art wouldn't mind some big-time act addressing the evils of those pissing on us from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Any pop cultural port in a liberty-eroding shitstorm, and all.</p>
<p>Two listens in, though, and it was clear: <i>American Idiot</i> was musically dodgy and politically empty. Political pop has its place, at least when didacticism doesn't drain the wit and life from a band's songwriting. But <i>American Idiot</i> failed utterly as coherent propaganda <i>and</i> as rock invigorating enough to agitate the pleasure centers. Have <i>you</i> tried to parse the lyrics to ""Holiday"" or ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"" lately? This wasn't anti-imperialist dissent set to kick-ass. It was gaudy, way-too-impressionistic, self-congratulatory garbage warbled over lumbering AOR dressed in strings and conceptual malarkey.</p>
<p>The fact that <i>American Idiot</i> had an undercurrent of lukewarm liberal backslapping, and was released during the blackest days of the W. era, certainly gave it a big contextual profile boost at the time. But what really assured its success was the fact that the band had smartly made a grab-bag of proven gestures swiped from the ignoble history of Big Rock, along with some earnest, commercially canny self-cannibalization. And then there was the icky transparency of the band's attempt to shuck their lingering entry-level pop-punk rep, the last of the slack-and-proud generation to reveal their sad, predictable need for ""boomer respect.""</p>
<p>When a record like that sells a bazillion copies, you can be assured that the band won't be scaling back its ambitions on the follow-up. And <i>21st Century Breakdown</i> is indeed another hour-plus slab of jumped-up alt-rock as political/musical theater-- overlong, exhausting, and corny as hell.</p>
<p>If <i>American Idiot</i> was an aesthetic failure, you certainly never doubted the band's conviction. Sure, you might cringe when you realized all that effort was in service of fulfilling Billie Joe Armstrong's dreams of merging boneheaded pogo-pop with Broadway shlock. You might have lamented that no one pointed out the inanity of many of the album's creative choices, like naming a protagonist ""Jesus of Suburbia"", perhaps because Armstrong was a grown-ass millionaire with carte blanche from his corporate masters. Nonetheless, the band really put its backs into that vapid, humorless trash.</p>
<p><i>21st Century Breakdown</i> is just as pompous and dumb, but it lacks even that old misguided passion. It's a slog, but not the kind that results when a band forgets the importance of editing when in the throes of ""trying to say something."" Its sprawl feels entirely unearned, three men worried about meeting expectations rather than driven by urgency. The performances are blandly professional, because any major-label rock band of Green Day's abilities could shit this stuff out in their sleep, and emotionally inert. This is the crafting of a modern epic as a dreary day-job routine.</p>
<p>Tré Cool-- a drummer who's never really progressed beyond ""fast with a lot of rolls"" and ""mid-tempo militaristic oompah""-- flaunts his competence level with a metronomic anti-creativity. Mike Dirnt's bass playing, once reliably adding needed punch to band's flimsier tunes, is often buried under Armstrong's claustrophobic, monochromatic guitar. As a songwriter, Armstrong was always juicing the platonic pop-punk tune at best. Listening to him try classic rock moves is cringe-y in the way you'd expect when a guy with a limited skill set pines for stadium godhood. Having exhausted his new tricks on <i>American Idiot</i>, he's descended into repetition, almost self-parody. And what he's recycling wasn't much worth hearing in the first place.</p>
<p>Just count the number of times he falls back on the lame bait-and-switch of the pretty acoustic intro, setting the listener up to expect one of Green Day's oft-regrettable ballads, only to kick in with a faceless blast of ur-mall-punk. Or the lifeless Frankensteins of songs from <i>International Superhits</i>, the sound of man stitching his past hits together out of desperation or callowness or both. It's kind of amazing an album with so many multi-genre suites and deliberate mid-song shifts in mood can also feel so maddeningly static for long stretches. You start to cling to the novelties and experiments, however bad:  the way ""Peacemaker"" sounds like a cutting-room leftover from some ersatz American International Pictures surf/spy movie, or the more-Wings-than-Fabs McCartney bite of ""Last Night on Earth"".</p>
<p>As for the album's storyline, I plead the most willful kind of ignorance. It seems to be another loosely sketched state-of-the-union about how far up shit creek we are as a nation/planet, with a slight positivist tinge given this weird pause we seem to be in between reconstruction and total collapse. So ""desperate, but not hopeless"" is about as close as Armstrong gets to a memorably bite-sized universalist sentiment. The lyrics are otherwise another do-you-really-have-the-time-to-unpack-this jumble of inscrutable storytelling, pseudo-profundities, and just-add-bile anti-authoritarianism. Which means I could be mistaking plain ol' love songs for Major Statements. Or it could be that Armstrong's pretensions now completely obscure any remaining bubblegum charmers. You can listen only so long for something catchy and human-scaled while being consistently rewarded with lines like, ""When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul, your faith walks on broken glass.""</p>
<p>Green Day had been augmenting the three-chords-or-less thrashing since the trad power-pop touches of <i>Nimrod</i>, taking it further with the Brit Invasion homages that peppered <i>Warning</i>. Musically, a self-consciously eclectic and ambitious Green Day had been a reality long before Armstrong began gorging on Headline News and the Springsteenian mythos. But Green Day's late-decade addiction to scale, and reinforcing their own stature, has drained all the immediacy and pleasure from their music. Without some sort of attitude-correcting flop, the band will probably continue to abuse your tolerance for ego-driven padding. And if the CD format finally expires between now and the next one, watch out when Billie Joe convinces Reprise to disseminate his next <i>Economist</i>-meets-Vegas horrorshow on snappily branded external hard drives.</p></div>"|13045.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13045-21st-century-breakdown/|4.8|Jess Harvell

Despite residing  on the always trustworthy Frenchkiss, Passion Pit aren't cool.   Their approach to danceable rock music is more Friday night than year-end-list. It's also distinctly, for a lack of a better term, American.  It's  extroverted, brash, and unconcerned with nuance, each synthesizer used  for maximum melodic impact instead of texture. Most of the time, singer Michael Angelakos'  half-eunuch/half-Jeremy Enigk voice is likely voicing some sort of commentary  on his feelings.  There's an almost archaic belief that a record  should have at least four singles and the nagging feeling that Passion  Pit could just be another garage/emo band that traded in their guitars for samplers.  Now that we've  gotten that out of the way, just about all of this works in <i>Manners</i>' favor, as it's the sort of heart-to-heart populist record that's  every bit as sincere as it is infectious-- though Angelakos sings in  a manner rarely heard outside of a shower with unpredictable temperature  control, it feels symbolic of a band that's completely unashamed,  not shameless, in its pursuit of a human connection.</p>
<p>It's easy to be skeptical. I understand.   Passion Pit are, after all, following a buzzed-about EP, <i>Chunk of Change</i>, that attracted detractors and admirers in equal measure. The story of <i>Manners</i>, however, is how Passion Pit evolve from a one-man pet project to a fully fleshed concern  that gives substance to Angelakos' melodic sensibilities over the course of more focused song lengths, more dynamic arrangements, and 40 minutes  of joy-buzzer pushing.</p>
<p><i>Chunk of Change </i> certainly had its rickety charms, but while  ""Make Light"", ""Moth's Wings"", and ""Eyes as Candles"" retain  the EP's building blocks-- glycemic keyboards, insistent major keys, and falsetto-- their compositional aspects go beyond what  Passion Pit were capable of as a solo affair. ""Make Light"", despite  working patiently towards a satisfying hook, would've likely plateaued  during its midsection, but Nate Donmoyer's live drums keep it skidding  perilously towards an organic collapse <i>Chunk of Change </i> never allowed.  The elegiac tempos of ""Moth's Wings"" and  ""Eyes as Candles"" veer closer to first-kiss soundtracking than even <i> Chunk</i>'s mushier moments, but they're rendered fleshy with slowly  blossoming arrangements of church choirs, saxophones, and a winding synth  lead on the latter that catches you off-guard with its similarity to  ""Walk of Life"".</p>
<p>Barely past drinking age, Passion  Pit are obviously overjoyed with the studio as romper room, but the  toy that has gotten the most attention is the kiddie choir that pops  up on two of the first four songs.  Call them behind-the-curve  as they double up the ""higher and higher"" part of the chorus from  ""Little Secrets"" (<i>that's</i> the one that sounds like ""D.A.N.C.E."",  Jarvis), but it's more over-the-top, and that's kind of the point-- in a weird  way, it's heartening how little Passion Pit concerns themselves with  decorum or trend-watching in the search of an irresistible hook.  <i> Manners </i>does go for the quick knockout, pulling a similar trick  five minutes later on the <i>Hissing Fauna </i> branch-off<i> </i>""The Reeling"", and while Side B tends to delay gratification,<i> Manners </i>is deceptively consistent even beyond its singles--<i> </i> if you like one Passion Pit song, you'll probably like them all.   Or you might not like any at all-- though ""Sleepyhead"" has proven  to be something of the consensus, its real-time chipmunk soul ambitions  fitting in better on <i>Manners </i> than it did tacked as a transitional track at the end of <i>Chunk of  Change. </i></p>
<p>But as ""Let Your Love Grow  Tall"" ushers in last call<i> </i> with a big ol' group hug, I realize how it puts me in a difficult position  as a music critic: what happens when you're scrambling to think of  why a record is worth hearing and you keep coming back to ""it makes  me happy""?  Too often, we use a band's debut simply to conjure  comparisons to other bands, but <i>Manners </i> is every bit as likely to bring to mind a successful night out with  friends, or the party where you finally got to talk to that person you've  been eying all semester.<i> </i> The video for ""The Reeling"" certainly helps with that visualization,  but in a manner similar to layers of faux-flesh being peeled off Angelakos'  face, the cracked-up lyrics themselves ache for some sort of connection  after realizing the futility of physical and emotional bunkers<i>. </i> It's a fitting contrast for a record that's certainly not the most  innovative or cred-boosting you'll hear this year, but quite possibly  the one that most demands to be socialized with and is just so easy  to love back.</p></div>"|13169.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13169-manners/|8.1|Ian Cohen

A note, on its  own, is just a sound. Same with a chord or the smack of a drum stick  on a snare. But by organizing those sounds, music can give them incredible  power, and it can do the same for words and phrases. <i>OK Bear</i>,  Jeremy Enigk's third solo album and second since the break-up of his  band Sunny Day Real Estate, offers quite a few examples of this phenomenon,  making melodic sense out of puzzling couplets like ""Crimson angel/ I  live and plant there still"" and ""Morning arise/ Traced by surprise/ In an ocean wind the waves are lost."" I'm not saying his lyrics are senseless on paper-- there's inherent power in a phrase such as ""They  got it all, but they ain't got emotion""-- but I am saying this  album lives or dies on Enigk's ability to weave a bunch of disjointed  images and odd, fragmentary sensory phrases into something that feels  like a story or a coherent emotional statement.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the album mostly  lives, and it's a small testament to the seemingly paradoxical ability of ethereal, bodyless music to affect us viscerally. To back up a bit, <i>OK Bear</i> is a confident  modern-rock album, and Enigk spends considerably less time fussing with  big arrangements and sweeping gestures than he did on 2006's <i>World  Waits</i>. These songs are among his most direct, mature compositions  yet in spite of their often oblique lyrics, and his delicately ragged  voice is in fine form as he works to sell them. He controls the intensity  of each song quite well--""April Storm"" in particular benefits from  a great deal of restrain in the early verses, and you really feel it  when he opens up in the last verse and the guitars start to grind a  little.</p>
<p>The album's most dramatic moment  is also one of its weirdest, from a songwriting perspective. ""Just  a State of Mind"" begins softly, with acoustic guitars and harmony  vocals, and picks up with each verse, and then, at literally the last  moment, he introduces a brand new, dramatic melody on the last two lines.  It feels like the song is about to take off into some sweeping new section,  but instead it just ends, leaving the listener hanging. ""Sandwich  Time"" is more conventional, and probably the catchiest rock song on  the album, with Enigk running his backing vocals through a Leslie cabinet  (or a convincing approximation of one). In an unusual error, ""Sandwich  Time"" and ""In a Look"" are flipped on the tracklist, both on the  rear cover art and in the printed lyrics (""Sandwich Time"" is actually  track seven, while ""In a Look"" is actually track six). ""In a Look""  is a piano-driven song with a good 6/8 beat and some Eric Matthews-ish  horns on the bridge.</p>
<p>The album's production aids  Enigk's careful drama management, keeping every acoustic and electric  guitar, Rhodes piano, bassline, and synth separate and strong-- all that  space gives the dynamic shifts more power. <i>OK Bear</i> is a good album-- it  won't blow you away, but I get the sense from listening that Enigk is  confident enough in his music not to need to blow you away. Simply moving  you a little is enough now, and sometimes it's nice to have an album  that does that so ably and unpretentiously.</p></div>"|12984.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12984-ok-bear/|7.1|Joe Tangari

They have  three voices, three keyboards, and a drum machine in their arsenal,  yet each element stands out from the gleaming propulsion with razored  precision, as if the band were constantly saying, ""No, after <i>you</i>.""  They deliver inspirational-kitten-calendar platitudes that would make  Whitney Houston blush with disarming directness, their plain yet dulcet  voices arranged in fussy group harmony-- excessive melisma being, after  all, simply immodest. The band's egalitarian and mutually supportive  dynamic pays off on the harmonious <i>Still Night, Still Light</i>,  their third and best album. It's feather-light electro-pop that's  not to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>As always, the music is utterly  innocent of abrasion, dissonance, and chance-- everything is clamped  down so tightly that the unstinting pertness seems neurotic; the insistence  on letting go, moving on, and being who you are a ""doth protest too  much"" kind of thing. You start to wonder what sort of roiling emotional  bedlam all of this chipper well-being is keeping at bay. Yet the starchy  sincerity keeps things merrily ambiguous, and politeness saturates the  lyrics as well as the music. ""Only You Can Make You Happy"" feels  like stumbling into the daily affirmation part of a group-therapy session,  were it sung in a melting madrigal over lazily scudding synthesizers.</p>
<p>The contrast between goopy  sentiments and rigorous music is one thing that makes Au  Revoir Simone unique, but their take on the break-up song is of even  greater interest. They hospice their own love affairs with tenderness  and grace, thereby avoiding the garden varieties-- vindictive, triumphant,  pathetic, unilateral-- of the form. They strive for consensus  in ""let's discuss this reasonably until we both agree to break up  in a loving and supportive fashion"" songs, and achieve some of their  sharpest lyrics in this mode. On ""Shadows"", they sing, ""I'm  moving on/ I hope you're coming with me/ Because I'm not strong  without you."" Come with me by going away, help me be strong enough  to leave you-- it's a crafty illustration of romantic intractability.</p>
<p>Despite their veneer of cunning  naïveté, there is much more to Au Revoir Simone than rudimentary keyboards  and adorable pigtails. ""All or Nothing"", a chiming bedtime anthem  about getting drunk in taxicabs, supports the notion that the group's  studied banality is less of a worldview than a wish. They're still  turning out ditties of piercing simplicity-- ""The Last One"" and ""Take Me As I Am"" could be transcribed for a baby's mobile with  little loss of effect-- but there are also svelte keyboards in deft  counterpoint on ""Knight of Wands"" and carefully contrasted bright  and matte tones in the riff of ""Only You Can Make You Happy"". The  songs move with lathed elegance from skeletal to bursting and back again.  The clichés arrive at a breathtaking clip, imbued not with the melodrama  of pop theater, but the earnest intimacy of a friend murmuring in your  ear.</p></div>"|13000.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13000-still-night-still-light/|7.8|Brian Howe

In over a decade of painterly sonic experiment, bouncing from name to name, style to style, he has fashioned such a colorful body of work that even the artist himself warns against drawing connections and comparisons. Because he doesn't want to diminish his collaborators' roles, he approaches each project-- there are no ""side projects"" to him-- on its own terms and asks listeners to follow suit. This year alone, Herren's mark can be found on three new records: one under his high-tech Prefuse 73 moniker, another that pairs him up with Zach Hill, and, here, a return to his kindler, gentler early work as Savath y Savalas. A partnership with Eva Puyuelo Muns since 2004, the outfit has recently welcomed beat-sculptor Roberto Carlos Lange, the son of Ecuadorean immigrants, into the fold.</p>
<p>And the result is <i>La Llama</i>. Expanded to a trio, S&amp;S have changed in ways you might not expect. Of course, there is a thickening of the mix, but it owes more to the group's new methods than to the adding of a third voice or instrument. Swirls of psychedelic haze, and not only the crisp folk heard on <i>Apropa't</i> (2004), lend <i>La Llama</i> its grainy-footage aura, a sort of blissful density that fogs up each track. While part of that creamier texture is rooted in South American acid-folk-- more on that later-- another part comes from the ragtag recording. Warmly hued, dust-flecked, intimate, it isn't hard to believe the trio put this record together in a downtown apartment. The opener, which seems to cut and paste strips of the everyday ambiance seeping into his window, hints at the warm DIY production to follow. Tinny collisions of sound, the stalled construction projects around the Bowery may serve as metaphors, depending on your mood, for the faceplanting of high finance or simply for the relentless self-fashioning of Scott Herren. Certainly its collage-like quality reflects the melting pots that, over the years, he has labored to embody in musical form, from the Iberian diaspora's origin point, to the African enclaves of northern Brazil, back to his room in the immigrant mecca of New York.</p>
<p>Not only is this the group's first non-studio effort, but it also serves as its debut on Stones Throw. With their yen for leftfield tunes that fall within, or just beyond, the bounds of hip hop, the label that has housed both upstarts like Koushik and stalwarts like J Dilla makes a neat fit for the soulful adventurousness of Savath y Savalas. In fact, it seemed to be a match made in crate-digger heaven. The general manager at Stones Throw, the NPR funk archeologist Egon, shares Herren's love for the scene in Recife, Brazil in the mid-1970s. For many, that may not ring a bell. Luckily, reissues-- most by the vital Time-Lag Records-- have helped to reassemble a crude picture of this cauldron of psychedelia, with three records standing out as the towering documents of the subculture that gathered around Lula Cortes. There is the summery acousticism of Flaviola E O Bando Do Sol's self-titled record, the overdriven hymn to the four elements, <i>Paêbiru</i>, and <i>Satwa</i>'s suite of starlit protest ragas. But apart from the ubiquitous guitar-- strummed and picked here, sliced and diced there-- the outsize personality of Recife is tough to spot. Herren has explicitly said that the region exerts a ""direct and indirect influence,"" just one ingredient among many, but as the record beats on, one wishes that Brazilian muscle, verve, and eccentricity left a bigger mark on <i>La Llama</i>'s mostly safe and Starbucks-ready aesthetic.</p>
<p>Instead of a jolt of funky Brazilian mysticism, what we witness in the record is a simpler and surprisingly fluid evolution: a handful of strands from Herren's past work woven together. Not every strand was worth his effort, though. For one, the shift in <i>Apropa't</i>, the sophomore effort that hipped devotees to Muns' feather-light delivery, continues here with the chanteuse's return to the fore. But her contributions add little color to the songs, as her airy monotone tends to stick to a mechanical, lullaby delivery, revealing her razor-thin range on ""Barceloneta"" and amid the sleepy strums of ""Pavo Real"". On the other hand, that record's often soothing blend of Catalan folk and Chicago post-rock lives on, far more vividly, in the billowing ""Me Voy"" and the brooding guitars of ""No Despierta"".</p>
<p>Though <i>La Llama</i> never plants itself on a bed of breakbeats, at its best, it does revisit the hopscotch editing of Herren's Prefuse 73 work. It is an attitude toward composing that also guided his essentially instrumental Savath debut as well as 2004's <i>Mañana</i>. And this persistence of the adventurous, anxious side of Herren (arrayed against his rustically downtempo <i>Apropa't</i>/<i>Golden Pollen</i> side) seems to coincide with the arrival of Roberto Carlos Lange, a musician who cut his teeth in the late-night <i>peñas</i> of Miami before crafting backcloths to gallery installations, and whose avant-garde spirit can be felt on the best tracks. From the flutter and fuzz of ""Carajillo"", the Verocai-via-Varese frenzy of ""Una Cura"", or the spooky animalism of ""Pajaros en Cadaques"", one thing is clear. A good deal more Lange and a good deal less Muns would have brought out the best in Scott Herren.</p></div>"|13028.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13028-la-llama/|6.1|Roque Strew

Confidential to the celebs in surgical masks: If there's a real pandemic, we're all already born with it. No, not swine flu, bird flu, monkey pox, SARS, or West Nile virus. Not even anthrax, that post-9/11, pre-Iraq War worry most people appeared to forget overnight. The names of the diseases may change, but the panics they generate all represent the same thing: We're gonna die. And we couldn't be more terrified.</p>
<p>It isn't clear whether My Bloody Valentine will get their long-delayed reissues out before the CD dies; if current patterns hold though, <i>Loveless </i>lovers Deerhunter will have released more than enough spaced-out dominance. Many of their songs change drastically from online demo to final incarnation, but Atlanta's noise-pop lightning rods put it all out there. As with Lil Wayne and his workload, it's as if they sense their time here is limited. Please god, nobody mention Ryan Adams.</p>
<p>Although the total output by Deerhunter and various side projects can be uneven, the full band's official Kranky releases have rarely been less than face-melting. <i>Rainwater Cassette Exchange</i> is the fourth Deerhunter-related release on the label since October-- including last year's <i>Microcastle</i>/<i>Weird Era Cont.</i> album pairing plus guitarist Lockett Pundt's recent debut as Lotus Plaza, <i>The Floodlight Collective</i>-- and it's also maybe the slightest to bear the Deerhunter name. Now you hear it, now you don't. What was I just listening to again?</p>
<p>Except, justifiably, Deerhunter have a pretty big name to live up to at this point. And the more you listen to their latest release, the more it rewards you. <i>Rainwater Cassette Exchange </i>is nothing more-- and nothing less-- than five songs, lasting a total of just more than 15 minutes. Ranging from translucent psych-pop to pummeling garage-rock, they're alternately assured and vulnerable, direct and subtle, light and dark. Their repetitions toe the band's usual thin line between hooks and hypnotism. Through it all, we're haunted by disease and, ultimately, our own inevitable death. So many useless bodies.</p>
<p>As the <i>Fluorescent Grey</i> EP was to <i>Cryptograms</i>, so <i>Rainwater Cassette Exchange</i> is to <i>Microcastle</i>. Most of these songs would make sense packaged as a third piece of vinyl alongside <i>Microcastle</i>/<i>Weird Era Cont.</i>, though they have less in common with <i>Weird Era</i>'s vast sprawl. Like <i>Microcastle</i>, the new EP-- available digitally now, on CD and vinyl June 22-- was recorded with producer Nicolas Vernhes at Brooklyn's Rare Book Room. Also like <i>Microcastle</i>, <i>Rainwater Cassette Exchange</i> shifts between delicate 1960s-pop tunefulness and fist-pumping dopamine surges.</p>
<p>""I wanted <i>Microcastle</i> and <i>Weird Era</i> to be a Fall/Winter record,"" Bradford Cox once wrote in a blog post that has since been deleted. Among the last sounds you'll hear on the current EP is a child's cry of ""trick or treat."" Whether it's lilting melodies, some new-and-improved vocal harmonies, or Strokes-cum-Magazine stately clangor, <i>Rainwater Cassette Exchange</i> makes with the treats first. Then, as much as Cox likes to downplay the band's lyrics, you notice the ghostly stuff, the warnings of impending mortality. Autumnal material, yeah, but its bleak truths resonate all the more against the budding spring weather outside.</p>
<p>First, the treats. The title track opens the EP with girl-group sugar that helps the reverb-heavy overdrive go down. ""Do-oooh-oooh you believe in love at first sight?"" Cox sings, his voice beatific, his lyric Beatles-y (""With a Little Help From My Friends"", last verse, first line). Three songs-- ""Disappearing Ink"", ""Famous Last Words"", and ""Circulation""-- are propulsive garage-rock anthems in the style of <i>Microcastle</i> marquee moment ""Nothing Ever Happened"". The only other track, the lonesome ""Game of Diamonds"", started life on Deerhunter's blog, where it was drenched in shoegaze distortion. Here it gets a softer arrangement featuring piano and acoustic guitar-- all the better to hear Cox's uniquely engaging vocals, clear and frail and fricative.</p>
<p>It all sounds so harmless, it's a treat to find out we're actually getting tricked. ""Rainwater Cassette Exchange"" is sort of like <i>Microcastle</i>'s ""Agoraphobia"", had that song's erotically asphyxiated protagonist already been dead, or its arrangement paradoxically sprightlier. ""Famous Last Words"" opens with a lyric about ""your brother bleeding"" on the sidewalk, while a wobbly Theremin adds to the eerie October mood. Despite putting an Everly Brothers-esque vocal duet over distorted guitar lines, ""Circulation"" is about ""bad"" circulation, and Cox has a heart condition. ""Hands reach for my light when it gets dark,"" it sounds like he's saying, right before the song veers off into two minutes of bittersweet sound collage around where the live version becomes draped with ethereal vocal loops.</p>
<p>If <i>Rainwater Cassette Exchange</i> sounded evanescent to me on first listens, well, so are we. ""Time never meant that much to me,"" Cox sings on ""Game of Diamonds"", but that's belied not only by Deerhunter's work ethic, but also by words that Cox's emotionally isolated narrator-- Jens Lekman's ""It Was a Strange Time in My Life"" comes to mind-- repeats elsewhere in the song: ""I've counted every grain of sand."" Like, our endless numbered days. When Cox sings about lying drunk on the Bowery, it's hard for me not to think of that night he rambled endlessly and flouted New York's smoking laws at the Bowery Ballroom. That stuff'll kill ya, you know.</p>
<p>So what do you think is gonna happen to us now? Are we gonna get younger, happier, prettier? ""Nothing can be changed,"" goes ""Famous Last Words"", but that isn't exactly true. Consider ""Disappearing Ink"" a metaphor for the temporariness of it all, and for what's permanent: ""Disappearing ink, but the words still sting."" After you play a good song, it's gone in the air, but you can still feel it. After you type something stupid on the internet, you can try to delete it, but you can't take it back. That means you and I are gonna live forever. Now those would be famous last words.</p></div>"|12991.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12991-rainwater-cassette-exchange/|7.5|Marc Hogan

As the frontman for Modesto, California-based  Grandaddy, he sang about homemade pets, homesick space miners, and carpool  jockeys struck dumb by the natural world. Three years after that band's  final breaths, his world has grown no less odd. On his first solo album,  he sets songs about dead dogs and birds on suicide watch to technorganic  arrangements featuring ELO guitars, from-the-heart-of-space synths,  and steady, stoic drums-- if drums can be said to sound stoic, which  in Lytle's world, why the hell not? With Grandaddy, Lytle sung his  mock epics with such earnestness that many took them as ironic, which  itself is a little ironic. But then as now, his songs work because they  are deeply sincere, and that sincerity makes them sound all the more  awestruck and imaginative.</p>
<p>So <i>Yours Truly, The Commuter</i> sounds an awful lot like a Grandaddy album-- not just another Grandaddy  album, though, but a really good one, the best since <i>Sumday</i>.  Relocated from Modesto to Bozeman, Mont., he recorded these dozen  songs over three years, sequestering himself in his home studio to indulge  the perfectionism he says he couldn't entertain with the band. It's  a return, of sorts, to his roots: Grandaddy was born as a solo bedroom  project for Lytle in the mid-90s and mutated into a full band. Such  care and attention show through in these songs, which generally sound  a little spacier and synthier than the band's records. On the other  hand, in three years you'd think he could have come up with a better  album cover.</p>
<p><i>Yours Truly</i> opens with what  sounds like a thumb piano playing a quiet overture, which is interrupted  first by a foundational bass rhythm and then by Lytle's warmly familiar  voice:</p>
<p><i>Lytle:  ""Last thing I heard I was left for dead.""</i><br/><i>Comically high-pitched chorus:  ""Yeah?""</i><br/><i>Lytle:  ""I could give two shits about what they said. I may be limping, but  I'm coming home.""</i></p>
<p>Is this a rebuke to critics who greeted  Grandaddy's final breaths with enthused ambivalence, to no-longer-amicable  bandmates, or to some made-up tormentors too quick to turn their backs  on him?  Whatever the target, the song strikes a defiant early note,  and because it's not only a solo album but a solo debut, it's tempting  and perhaps way too easy to read way too much into such moments. But <i> Yours Truly</i> is strong enough to absorb whatever interpretation you  throw at it and still retain some of its mystery. Besides, defiance  fits Lytle like s a sleek spacesuit. The title track immediately restores  some of the old grandeur to his signature sound, and songs like the  defensive ""Ghost of My Old Dog"" and the piano lament ""This Song  Is the Mute Button"" have unexpected bite.</p>
<p>""I see the pretty in things,"" he  sings on the latter, ""but you disappeared like a dream."" Lytle offsets  the somewhat caustic tone that creeps into some of these songs with  tender ruminations on absence, which fills the album. ""Rollin' Home  Alone"", possibly a sequel to the title track, grafts a distorted synth  line to sugary canned strings to evoke a great American expanse, as  if to soundtrack some long, lonely road trip. ""Flying Thru Canyons""  creates a churchly ambience perfectly summed up by that title. On the  other hand, ""It's the Weekend"" is Lytle's Loverboy moment, a  churning power-pop anthem that sounds like a Friday-afternoon staple  on classic rock stations of the future.</p>
<p>As with previous albums, <i>Yours Truly</i> benefits from creative sequencing that winks at expectations. There  are two obvious closers here, and neither of them come at the album's  end. The first is the opening title track, whose chorus-- ""I may be  limping, but I'm coming home""-- makes Lytle sound like a true survivor,  and the second is the soft lament ""You're Too Gone"", which ends with  him singing ""So long, so long"" like he's floating away in a space  pod. Instead, everything closes with ""Here for Good"", a tender,  almost entropic ballad that sounds less like mission accomplished than  a mission never undertaken. Again, it's tempting to read real-life  connections in a song like ""Here for Good"". It's not that they're  not there, but they don't matter. Such autobiographical trappings  aren't necessary to make <i>Yours Truly</i> sound strangely affecting  or Lytle newly reinvigorated.</p></div>"|13037.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13037-yours-truly-the-commuter/|7.4|Stephen M.

Ciara's never exactly been an album artist, but her last two records had album tracks that were good for at least a few moments of dizzy slow-burn pop ecstasy, her languid robotic coo curling itself around expertly futuristic tracks from whatever producer was on fire that year. Ciara's main gift was the way her soft, tiny voice would disappear into the track, turning itself into just one working part in a beautiful, gleaming machine. It's not that she didn't have personality; there's a certain sweet-hearted down-home snap to singles like ""Goodies"" and ""Oh"", and the take-no-shit force of those songs made the heart-stopping ballad ""Promise"" sound that much more sweet and tender. But her brilliance has always been in interpretation, in selling a pop producer's furthest-out future-pop ideas and turning them into expert summertime pop. And it's that malleability that made her seem something like a new Janet Jackson, complete with headset mic.</p>
<p>Except in the lead-up to <i>Fantasy Ride</i>, she's come off more like circa-'09 Janet, thrashing around desperately for a hit single and facing interminable album-release pushbacks. <i>Fantasy Ride</i> went through two failed singles (the first of which, the T-Pain collab ""Go Girl"", doesn't even appear on the album) before the unimaginative but okay ""Love Sex Magic"" finally got her the radio foothold that had been hers to lose a couple of years ago. ""Love Sex Magic"" is really just a bargain-basement Justin Timberlake track, the sort of thing he could've had lying around in a closet somewhere nearly three years after <i>FutureSex/LoveSounds</i>. It's not bad, exactly; I like the elastic disco bounce. But it's lazy, and Timberlake's nerdy swagger really highlights Ciara's total lack of presence. That's a problem that comes up over and over on the album.</p>
<p>The big issue here is one of desperation. Every song clearly longs to be a hit. She's enlisted an absolute murderers' row of producers: Polow, Danja, The-Dream/Tricky Stewart. All of these people seem like they should be able to work magic with Ciara, but somehow, the songs just aren't there. The-Dream and Tricky Stewart tend to fill their tracks with empty spaces, and Ciara's voice needs hall-of-mirrors production to really register, so slight, minimal tracks like ""Ciara to the Stage"" and ""Like a Surgeon"" leave her sounding stranded. ""Pucker Up"" has a flat, tinny club-pop beat from Rodney Jerkins (still alive!) and lots of talk about Ciara's swag, a concept that even she does not seem to quite get. The Timberlake co-written ""G is for Girl (A-Z)"" has an unbelievably goofy alphabetical-slaughter lyrical conceit. ""Turntables"" has a really good moment where it switches abruptly from crispy electro to EQed-out bloghouse, but the impact is sort of blunted by the presence of Chris Brown. And it's not like Brown does anything particularly egregious on the song, but, I mean, this guy just famously (OK, allegedly) mashed out his pop-star girlfriend on Grammy night. Why would you invite him onto your album for his first post-abuse appearance? Do you need a hit <i>that badly</i>?</p>
<p>""1, 2 Step"", Ciara's second hit, was breezy little roller-rink electro jam, and one of the best things about it was how effortless it sounded. And now Ciara's thrashing around looking for a single, and somehow, it shows. And yet that almost manic obsession with crossover love leads <i>Fantasy Ride</i> to some great, fascinating places. ""High Price"", in a lot of ways, is a straight-up ""Oh"" retool (right down to the great, stuttery Ludacris guest-verse), except Ciara, for no apparent reason, sings it in this histrionic opera voice, which lends her shit-talk lyrics a hallucinatory power: ""See me in the drop, head fresh up out the hair salon/ Booty look softer than a McDonald's hamburger bun."" (Those aren't even soft!) ""Never Ever"" takes a big chunk of its chorus from a song I never could stand, the Philly soul staple ""If You Don't Know Me By Now"", and surrounds it with dizzily great Polow da Don production flourishes and a typically superb Young Jeezy guest-verse, somehow rendering its source material tolerable in the process. ""I Don't Remember"" is a sweaty, uncomfortable heartbroken hangover song, with whooshing Euro-trance keyboards that feel so totally wrong that they sort of work.</p>
<p>So that's what you get with <i>Fantasy Ride</i>: A few brilliant left turns that feel almost accidental mixed in with a sort of end-times hunger for a top-40 audience that doesn't seem to exist anymore. As a vivid little snapshot of what's happened to the pop music business, it's fascinating. But it's not much of an album.</p></div>"|13092.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13092-fantasy-ride/|4.4|Tom Breihan

When the band worked at its peak, it operated in a sort of twilight haze, and the ease with which one got lost in its beauty played a large part in determining what one got out of it.  Factor in their more or less lasting hiatus (recent SXSW reunion aside), and the American Analog Set legacy hangs in a sort of hazy purgatory. Did the band exist, or did we merely imagine it?</p>
<p>The ghostly memory of the AmAnSet lingers near leader Andrew Kenny's new project the Wooden Birds as well, but it hardly hovers over it. If anything, Kenny, never a howler, is even more hushed here, with the Wooden Birds' debut <i>Magnolia</i> sounding as if it were recorded under extenuating circumstances-- a sleeping baby upstairs, say, or a sensitive neighbor-- only for Kenny to discover he liked how those muffled results turned out. Kenny and his new cohorts David Wingo, Lymbyc System drummer Michael Bell, and American Analog-vet Leslie Sisson seem to relish working within these spare constraints, where every note counts and nothing slips in to clutter to the songs. That precision and the process seem to have pushed Kenny in an interesting musical direction, too, seeing as so much of <i>Magnolia</i> recalls Lindsey Buckingham at his least manic, specifically the strange little ditties that fill Fleetwood Mac's <i>Tusk</i> and <i>Mirage</i>, nestled between the bigger hits. The resemblance is almost uncanny on songs such as ""False Alarm"", ""Hailey"", and the brief ""Hometown Fantasy"", which contains a heart-grabbing minor turn that's a perfect counter to its initial country feel.</p>
<p>That loose country vibe pervades tracks like ""The Other One"", ""Quit You Once"", and ""Never Know"" as well, each relatively interchangeable but so tasteful and uncomplicated their redundancy doesn't hurt, especially when Sisson starts chiming in with some breathy harmonies that fit the limited musical field like the last piece of a (simple) puzzle. After that it's back to songs like ""Anna Paula"" and ""Seven Seventeen"", the latter a deceptively sweet meet-cute number, and each with Sisson again playing a subdued Stevie Nicks to Kenny's mellow-mode Buckingham. Like much of <i>Magnolia</i> before it, the songs lope along quiet, lazy rhythms in no particular hurry to get where they're going. But while the Wooden Birds never quite arrive anywhere special, that's not to say Kenny isn't pointed that general direction. If <i>Magnolia</i> is a disc tinged with innocence and nostalgia, it's tinted by a hint of shadowy dread drawn from someplace more mysterious than Kenny  is willing to reveal just yet.</p></div>"|13070.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13070-magnolia/|7.1|Joshua Klein

Extolled by  critics, embraced by indie rock kids, appreciated by  metal legions, Wolves' overwhelming crescendos and glowing decrescendos, beautiful and brutal, spoke  as much to worshippers of Emperor's <i>Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk</i> as acolytes of Radiohead's <i>Kid A</i>. The band offered an  enigmatic allure, too, speaking of its communal farm outside of Olympia,  Wash. And Wolves' espousal of a pagan approach to black metal-- a genre long bound to an upside-down cross-- was refreshing. So purists  be damned: Two years ago, Wolves in the Throne Room offered a rendezvous  for two very unlikely demographics by aiming extreme in several directions.</p>
<p>Whatever bridges Wolves might  have built in 2007 are mostly a  memory this year, though: The EP <i>Malevolent Grain</i> and the LP <i> Black Cascade</i> disassemble the integrated power of <i>Two Hunters </i> and its predecessor, <i>Diadem of 12 Stars</i>, by plucking the black-metal sections from their former surrounding swells and stretching their  ends until what's left feels mostly like a flatline. Imagine cutting  cheap wine with water and trying to get drunk: It's unnecessary work for little payoff.</p>
<p>Excepting the first side of <i> Malevolent Grain</i>, each of the six Wolves cuts is a smear,  smoothing black metal's disruptive bursts into 10-14 minute trances  that slowly, sparingly shift in meter and volume. The idea-- to create  a stable atmosphere from music that traditionally gnashes any space  it fills-- is more interesting than its execution. For instance, ""Hate  Crystal"", <i>Malevolent Grain</i>'s  B-side, is an 11-minute march that opens at full blast and ends mostly  at the same clip. The guitars move in orthodox progressions, and the  drums steadily chew from beneath, adding variety with the occasional  extra cymbal splash or snare drop. Only the song's understated coda-- where  the parts fall out of lockstep and apart from one another without fading  out-- offers intrigue. Like William Basinski's <i>The Disintegration Loop  I-IV</i>, the object's corrosion is more interesting than the object  itself. Also, that's not a compliment.</p>
<p>All of <i>Black Cascade</i> pounds away with a similar notion for four tracks and 50 minutes, offering  four black metal tides that occasionally shift into some texturally  bankrupt, wintry drone. Separated from its once-intriguing surroundings,  Wolves' music feels listless and dull-- music doing its best to get by on size, not strength or sound. It's  not compelling. At least it's listenable.</p>
<p>Side A of <i>Malevolent Grain</i> isn't: Released in America as a limited run of black vinyl and in  Europe as a set of 700 12"" picture discs that sold out almost immediately, <i> Malevolent Grain</i> is barely worth the Google search it takes to find  free, high-quality rips. The EP<i> </i> splits the band's powers between the record's halves, so that the  heavy stuff comes on the B-side. The A-side, then, is a workshop for  Jamie Meyers, this effort's token female. She possesses less nuance  than Jessica Kinney, the <i>Two Hunters </i> vocalist who seemed so well suited for those tunes. The three-piece  rock rumble suggests an eventual eruption, but the band simply varies  its speed, volume, and density, lashing repeatedly against a few notes  and themes. Maybe that sounds nice, but-- left alone above it all, minus  a structural or sonic foil-- Meyers sounds like Evanescence leading a  tribute to Enya. It's a 13-minute cringefest.</p>
<p>Perhaps these releases are  concessions to the difficulty of climbing from a tour van nightly and  recreating such complex music onstage. Then, of course, there's the  frustration of disappointed fans who expect it all and get only the  band's heavier tendencies with the price of admission. That's fair  enough, I suppose. But must a live show meet a record's standards? And  should a performance dictate a record by a band that once took such risks?  Indeed, the live experience is an extemporaneous one-- here tonight,  restarted tomorrow. But a great record, one hopes, can be its own statement,  something that lives forever in a world of its own design. With its  deity talk and complete grandeur, <i>Two Hunters </i> worked like that. It was adventurous, engaged, imaginative. At their  best, though, <i>Malevolent Grain </i> and <i>Black Cascade</i>, are just sort of there, kicking up a thin  cloud of dust they're hoping you'll perceive as pitch black.</p></div>"|13030.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13030-black-cascade-malevolent-grain-ep/|2.8|Grayson Currin

The three-piece  rock rumble suggests an eventual eruption, but the band simply varies  its speed, volume, and density, lashing repeatedly against a few notes  and themes. Maybe that sounds nice, but-- left alone above it all, minus  a structural or sonic foil-- Meyers sounds like Evanescence leading a  tribute to Enya. It's a 13-minute cringefest.</p>
<p>Perhaps these releases are  concessions to the difficulty of climbing from a tour van nightly and  recreating such complex music onstage. Then, of course, there's the  frustration of disappointed fans who expect it all and get only the  band's heavier tendencies with the price of admission. That's fair  enough, I suppose. But must a live show meet a record's standards? And  should a performance dictate a record by a band that once took such risks?  Indeed, the live experience is an extemporaneous one-- here tonight,  restarted tomorrow. But a great record, one hopes, can be its own statement,  something that lives forever in a world of its own design. With its  deity talk and complete grandeur, <i>Two Hunters </i> worked like that. It was adventurous, engaged, imaginative. At their  best, though, <i>Malevolent Grain </i> and <i>Black Cascade</i>, are just sort of there, kicking up a thin  cloud of dust they're hoping you'll perceive as pitch black.</p></div>"|13030.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13030-black-cascade-malevolent-grain-ep/|4.5|Grayson Currin

So it seems like a good time to pause and  look back at the old county road that runs parallel to the highway of  Beam's albums and compile some rarities for the fans. ""For the fans""  doesn't necessarily mean hardcore types-- if you've liked any of Iron  &amp; Wine's albums so far, you'll almost certainly like this, but it's  also probably not the first thing to buy.</p>
<p>The 2xCD set covers  his career to date, from his earliest solo acoustic material to his later,  blown-out productions with Brian Deck, who has a knack for appropriately  housing the kind of hushed, ramshackle tunes Beam writes. The chosen  tracks range from B-sides and compilation cuts to previously unreleased sessions, and all are out of print. Beam's quiet home recordings are housed  on Disc One, while his studio creations are on Disc Two. Your favorite  Iron &amp; Wine album will likely determine which disc you spend more  time with, but for me, Disc Two is where the greatest treasures lie.</p>
<p>Beam's more sonically adventurous  period is well-documented on that disc, which features four outstanding  tracks recorded for the film <i>In Good Company</i>. ""Communion Cups  &amp; Someone's Coat"" sports beautifully layered vocals, while ""Belated  Promise Ring"" holds even with nearly any Iron &amp; Wine album track  with its softly ingratiating melody. They're appetizers for the nine-minute  opus ""The Trapeze Swinger"", though, which is one of those songs  that, in spite of all its finery-- the layered backing vocals, the steady,  stomping rhythm, the memorable melody-- reminds you how simply powerful  a well-chosen chord progression will be. Beam's casual conception of  the graffiti on the gates of heaven-- ""We'll Meet Again"", ""Fuck  the Man"", and ""Tell My Mother Not to Worry""-- are the kind of rich  lyrics that reward close listening.</p>
<p>Outside the tracks for that film, there's still plenty more to love. ""Kingdom of the Animals"" is  a wonderful slow country number, with a two-step rhythm and vivid imagery:  ""Jenny was gone and the moon blooms all shining/ As we dragged our  panic up and down the riverbed/ Sweating wild and weird in our Sunday  clothes."" The banjo-driven ""Serpent Charmer"" kicks up a dusty  racket, while the vocals on ""Carried Home"" are so stretched out  and lush that the song practically qualifies as ambient music. On his  solo acoustic version of New Order's ""Love Vigilantes"", he actually  captures the melody more powerfully than Bernard Sumner himself did.</p>
<p>Over on Disc One, there are  three additional covers, as Beam takes on the Flaming Lips' ""Waiting  for a Superman"", Stereolab's ""Peng! 33"", and the Postal Service's  ""Such Great Heights""-- alas, his most beloved song-- though none is particularly revelatory. His  similarly styled cover of the Four Tops' ""The Same Old Song"" isn't  included for some reason, but it's a better example of a cover that  reveals something unexpected about the original. His originals fare  quite a bit better. ""Dearest Forsaken"" has his trademark whisper  falsetto with a  bit of overdubbed slide guitar and banjo to heighten  the atmosphere. One of Beam's earliest originals, ""Sacred Vision"",  reveals him as a writer whose talent developed quickly. The simple melody  and guitar picking are basic enough but create an intimate setting for  lines like, ""There's no way to grow that don't hurt.""</p>
<p><i>Around the Well</i> is a  great retrospective that heps fans to a lot of difficult-to-locate material  from one of this decade's finest songwriters. While there is some fairly  flat stuff on the first disc, it really gives the listener the sweep  of his development as a writer, musician, and arranger. It also works  as a nice palate cleanser for wherever Beam takes his muse next. He's  such a prolific writer and recorder that it seems likely he's already  begun producing things for his next odds'n'sods comp. Hopefully  it will be as good as this one.</p></div>"|13041.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13041-around-the-well/|7.3|Joe Tangari

The band is now a power trio, with Julian Brown on bass and Dean Stone on drums. In jettisoning his reliance on Cuban and Brazilian folk traditions, Whiteman has discovered a new musical personality that is both more prosaic and more sharply defined: <i>Eats Darkness</i> rocks harder than prior work, with crisper edges, while feeling more playful and adventurous.</p>
<p>It works when Whiteman sticks to his indie-rock comfort zone. He has an unremarkable voice and a sketchy track record when it comes to memorable melody, but he also has a real knack for tooling terrific parts. It's admirable how his best songs outstrip his resources by sheer diligence; plenty of musicians have done less with more. ""Eazy Speaks"" is a great example of Whiteman packing salient details into a brisk, approachable framework. It zips right along on a crafty riff filled with decorative hitches and fillips. ""Soul Unwind"" is another winner, its titular refrain unfurling like a victory banner above cascading guitars and tweaky studio embellishments. ""Xerses"" gets a long way on its lyrical bassline alone.</p>
<p>When Whiteman ventures further afield in his songwriting, the results range from tepid to occasionally execrable. The title song pairs a weak-tea IDM track with thin-toned electric guitar noodling to zero effect. Nearly a third of the album's 13 tracks are given over to second-rate DOOM-style sample collages, using sound effects and the voices of artists such as Stan Brakhage and Kenneth Patchen in rather facile ways. They recreate the insane rapper's culture-as-playground sensibility without tapping into his eerie, subtle logic, and while they give the record what passes for a vague conceptual center-- revolutionary, society-in-decline stuff that is borne out in lyrics derisively peppered with the names of corporations-- they also convey a sense of unappealing sanctimony while obscuring the album's through-line.</p>
<p>And then there's ""Perfect Fit"". There comes a moment of truth in every indie rocker's life when he thinks, ""Gee, I should try my hand at a sort of dub reggae song."" Ideally, he shares this thought with a trusted friend who shakes him by the shoulders until he relents. Whiteman must have kept it to himself, or maybe he just has unshakable shoulders. Either way, indie-reggae doesn't look good on anyone. I can't help but think more could've been done. Didn't anyone notice that he was experimenting with excessive vocal reverb and stabby guitar delay? Might his bandmates have caught him browsing Peter Tosh comps at the record store and intervened? <i>Where were the parents in all of this</i>?</p>
<p>""Perfect Fit"" is also emblematic of the album's shaky coherence-- when there is both peppy indie-rock and ponderous pseudo-reggae, how can the center hold? As a whole, <i>Eats Darkness </i>feels haphazard in a way that shades into self-indulgence. Its adventurous spirit is culpable for its moderate highs and lows alike. It's overstuffed, sure, but prune out the interstitials, ""Perfect Fit"", and a couple of the weaker indie-rock tracks, and a generously portioned EP of sturdy, calculatedly raucous tunes remains.<span> <br/></span></p></div>"|13018.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13018-eats-darkness/|5.9|Brian Howe

Be that as it may, it seems fair to suggest that <i>Lost Channels</i>, the fourth full-length from Toronto-based Tony Dekker's Great Lake Swimmers project, <i>sounds</i> less ""indie"" than any previous Swimmers record. There's a degree of polish to the 12 tracks here that we haven't heard before from Dekker, though this feels less like the product of any meddling on the part of label Nettwerk-- a company that has worked with Canadian megastars Barenaked Ladies and Sarah McLachlan, not to mention Coldplay-- than a natural progression for a one-time solo endeavor that has attracted an orbit of like-minded co-conspirators over the years.</p>
<p>Along with the polish, it's the efforts of these co-conspirators that help make <i>Channels</i> feel like something ""more"" than an indie record. Some fuss has been made over the exotic locales where the album was put to tape-- abandoned grain silos, churches, historic sites, even an old castle situated on the St. Lawrence Seaway-- but the real story here is <i>what</i> was recorded and how well it all comes together. Chiming guitars dosado with warm flecks of banjo and light washes of electric organ in a series of dances that are dense in their construction but still deft in their execution. Electric and acoustic instruments mingle so effectively that it seems moot to make that distinction between them. Indeed, tracks such as the winning opener ""Palmistry"", ""Pulling on a Line"", and ""She Comes to Me in Dreams"" call to mind the more baroque moments from another act that did a pretty darn good job honing itself into something radio-friendly: R.E.M. (think <i>Out of Time</i> standouts ""Half a World Away"" and ""Losing My Religion"").</p>
<p>However the Swimmers have a ways to go if they're ever to scale the heights of Michael Stipe &amp; Co. (and one doubts that's really what they're aspiring to at this point, anyway). Plainly put, the songwriting here just isn't all big-league yet. Quieter tracks like ""Everything Is Moving So Fast"", ""Stealing Tomorrow"", and ""Concrete Heart"" reveal that Dekker still has some room to grow as a lyricist. With the tempos slowed and the layers of instrumentation largely stripped away, there's little left to hide the clunkiness of the former track's chorus (""Everything is moving so fast/ I am unlimited"") or the awkwardness of the latter song's central metaphor (which involves Toronto's CN Tower). With ""Stealing Tomorrow"" and elsewhere, Dekker tends to adhere too readily to the strict verse structures dictated by the music-- to color neatly within the lines he establishes for himself, so to speak. While the man's voice, with its engaging mix of agelessness and vulnerability, is perfectly suited to the Swimmers' sound, it would be nice to hear him stretch a bit, to sometimes force the music to keep up or play counterpoint rather than consistently meeting it halfway.</p>
<p>Yet <i>Channels</i> has its share of strong lyrical moments, from the well-crafted hand-reading imagery of ""Palmistry"" to the firmament-breaching poetry of ""Still"" to the soul-searching of ""River's Edge"". And despite the relative ""accomplished-ness"" of it all, the record does offer some pleasant surprises: particularly ""New Light"", tucked away near the record's end, which has a crepuscular quality to it that should pique the ears of any Pinetop Seven fans out there. Altogether, <i>Lost Channels</i> marks a step forward for the Swimmers, one that-- along with their relentless touring (and there's no questioning the indie-ness of that)-- should be sufficient to keep their star on the rise.</p></div>"|13042.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13042-lost-channels/|7.2|Matthew Solarski

At the same time, Brendan Reed was the drummer of Arcade Fire, and performed on that band's debut EP. Just a year later, Arcade Fire exploded in popularity just after Reed's departure, and the Unicorns imploded and disbanded before ever recording a second album. Though Penner and Reed have been active in the time since, Clues' self-titled debut marks both artists' return to the spotlight since their crucial early efforts in building Montreal's well-deserved reputation as one of the best arts scenes in North America.</p>
<p>Given that Penner is the primary songwriter in Clues, it should come as no surprise that the band's music bears a stronger resemblance to the skewed art pop of the Unicorns than the heart-pounding stadium anthems of Arcade Fire. Penner's guitar style remains hyperactive and colorful, but his songwriting has become more ambitious, adapting his former band's sense of faux-mystical whimsy to arrangements implying danger and adventure, resulting in music that often sounds as if it were intended to be the soundtrack of a Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign. The songs that most closely match this description are easily the most rewarding. The riffs in ""Cave Mouth"" swing and slash like an enormous battle ax; ""Remember Severed Head"" and ""Approach the Throne"" marry grandiose melodic themes and urgent, adrenaline-pumping rhythms. In these tracks, Clues hit upon a magical combination of Chavez's razor sharp chord progressions, the quasi-Medieval melodic sensibility of late-period Helium, and the oddball drama of the Danielson Famile.</p>
<p>The band is less successful in its quieter moments. Though about half of the album rocks outs with a twitchy, childlike enthusiasm, the remainder is deliberately static and lethargic. They are particularly fond of sequencing lulls before their most aggressive moments, as with the long, repetitive quasi-folk number that gradually builds to the manic burst of energy at the start of ""Cave Mouth"", or the tense ambience that carries through the opener ""Haarp"" until it erupts into a punk-rock payoff in its final minute. On a conceptual level, this is fine, and they are more than capable of evoking a spooky atmosphere, but these slower passages are simply not as pleasurable and well-realized as their frenetic rockers. These cuts also highlight the band's flaws. Just as Clues exaggerate dynamic shifts in their more rocking compositions, they also push their stillness to unfortunate extremes, resulting in seemingly interminable tracks that overwork threadbare melodic themes. Penner's thin voice is not flattered by the slowness either, as it nudges him to sing in an often-annoying nasal whine that sounds a bit like someone doing a mean-spirited impression of Mercury Rev's Jonathan Donahue.</p>
<p>Aside from these problems, <i>Clues</i> is a very assured debut with a fully formed aesthetic that exploits the strengths of its players while pushing them beyond their established comfort zones. With any luck, Penner will be able to stick with this project for a second album-- there may be some excellent tracks on this record, but it mostly hints at better things to come down the line.</p></div>"|13036.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13036-clues/|6.4|Matthew Perpetua

This kind of marketing creates strange dissonances with the music on <i>Kappe</i>. Sure, it's gloomy and foreboding. But it's also strident and glacially paced; it sounds more like a depressed La Monte Young than an heir of metal ancestry. At the same time, it strongly evokes the modulating bass oceans of Sunn O))). Ultimately, <i>Kappe</i> emphasizes how close this modern strand of abstract doom-metal is to postwar minimal aesthetics.</p>
<p><i>Kappe</i>'s atmosphere is familiar from Skodvin's last album, <i>Knive</i>. Ghosts rattle doorknobs in mansions of brooding tone; moaning saxophone and browned-out guitar harrow each other through claustrophobic effects rings. But the execution is different in almost every way. <i>Knive</i> deployed a broader variety of sounds across tighter fields, with deeper weavings of texture that verged on beats. There was a haltingness to it, as if the sounds were being painfully ejected, like kidney stones. <i>Kappe</i> trades <i>Knive</i>'s ear-catching shiftiness for gradual, hard-won fruition, a slow marathon of drifting gray sheens. It's commanding and stodgy where <i>Knive</i> was striving, convulsed. It seems at once more accomplished and less interesting.</p>
<p>This is mainly because <i>Knive</i>'s unruly approach didn't call for climaxes; sounds appearing or mutating at jagged intervals were hooks enough. But <i>Kappe</i>'s measured long-tone variations prime us for moments of clarity, which appear tortuously, if at all. After seven minutes of disembodied wails and creaking gears, we never see the light at the end of ""Tunnel of Love"", just vanish into darkness. ""Where Am I"" (always an appropriate question to ask of a Svarte Greiner song) begins with a singing bowl-like dirge; snatches of melody flit through the 16 grueling minutes of ""Candle Light Dinner Actress"", as Skodvin bathes a single, sullen note in corrosive harmonies until it dissolves, leaving the track to gnaw on itself like an empty stomach.</p>
<p>I wouldn't deign to penalize Skodvin for asking listeners for sometimes-immense feats of patience, but <i>Kappe </i>is so reserved and sternly formal that it can seem impersonal. There are caverns of detail and development buried in the opiated atmosphere, but I had to focus my full attention on the music for protracted spans to perceive them. Anything less discloses what sounds like an inordinately spooky traffic jam: a just-there wash of overpass rumbles, bicycle clatters, air-brake shrieks, and windy moon-roof ambiance.</p></div>"|12862.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12862-kappe/|6.0|Brian Howe

After all, nearly every piece  of promotion that's led up to the release of <i>Relapse </i> has caused the internet to stop whatever it was doing and form a unified  chorus exclaiming how washed up it made the guy look.   But did you know that after ""We Made You"" hit the airwaves, major networks ran segments on whether Eminem's ""controversial"" new  video went too far?  Let's think big picture here: In some corners of the indie community, people quibble about whether Wavves are overhyped, even though 99%  of America have absolutely no fucking clue who they are.  Eminem is divisive the way <i>BIG</i> people are.  Like A-Rod.  Or George  W. Bush.</p>
<p><i>Relapse </i> makes it abundantly clear where the line gets drawn in 2009.  It's  appropriate that the title character from ""Stan"" has become web  argot for ""obsessive fanboy,"" because Eminem drives both Stan and  stan alike crazy in the same exact way-- by completely ignoring them until  it's too late to make amends.  <i>Star Trek </i> isn't the only franchise reboot expected to do big numbers this summer--  instead of the 13-year-old who got into <i>The Slim Shady LP </i> and found that underground shit he did with Scam, <i>Relapse</i> is  for that guy's little brother who's 13-years old <i>right now</i>,  and Eminem is fully committed to upping the ante for today's desensitized  sensibilities.  Do a double-take when he rapped ""I just found out my  mom does more dope than I do""?  This time, you get to untangle the  knotty word thickets of ""My Mom"", wherein young Marshall gets bullied  and tricked by you-know-who into an addiction to prescription pills.   Recoil when he threatened to push a fat girl off the high dive in swim  class?  He's now murdering his cousin in a tub and drinking the bathwater.   Cringe at Eminem advocating roofies at a kegger?  Get ready for the term  ""felching"" to enter the public consciousness as Eminem gets anally  raped by his stepfather in a tool shed.  Got all that?  Congrats, you're  now four songs into <i>Relapse.</i></p>
<p>It's smart for Em to revert to the shock tactics of his glory days-- <i>Encore </i> was a <i>Chinese Democracy/HIStory</i>-style catastrophe of self-exile with no real exit strategy.  Though saddled with a terribly awkward rhythm  that Eminem thankfully ignores, ""Underground"" finds him laying waste  to a murderer's row of horror movie franchises with focused,  devilish glee. If <i>Relapse </i>were Eminem in Michael Myers mode, it would be fantastic, but instead  he's gone Mike Myers or even Robin Williams, subjecting us to ""wacky"" accents and a delusional sense that he still has a grip on what's edgy.</p>
<p>Favoring a voice more staccato and pinched  than ever, Eminem jacks off to <i>Hannah Montana, </i> hunts Lindsay Lohan for sport, sings about Valium in Auto-Tune, clowns  Jessica Simpson, and raps a verse in character as Christopher Reeve.   Much like <i>The Love Guru</i>, it's so painfully unfunny that you  can't even bother to act offended. And then there's ""Bagpipes  From Baghdad"". As with much of the record, you have to get past your  initial inclination to absolutely not give a shit about a deader than  dead topic, but when Eminem spits poison at Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon,  he comes off as so annoying and misguided that you end up taking  Mimi's side.  On ""If I Had"", Em rapped that he was  ""tired of hearing people say they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs.""   He begins ""My Mom"" by rapping ""I know people are tired of hearing  about my mom,"" before rattling off one of the record's many choruses  that are catchy in the way all grating but effective hooks are-- ""my  mom loved Valium and lots of drugs.""</p>
<p>As for the singles, well, they're still  here, but fortunately lacking any visual component.  As easy as it is  to ride Eminem for such sub-Jackie Harvey cultural mockups, it's possible  to argue in his defense that instantly dated references have been part  of the package since day one (Spice Girls, Tom Green, etc.). Truth is, the tracks where Eminem  turns on himself usually end up carrying the water, and it's no different  on <i>Relapse:</i> ""Deja Vu"" explains in exhaustive, darkly comedic  detail how he managed to disappear in a cocktail of nearly every available  intoxicant for the past Olympiad before summarizing, ""See, me and you, we almost had the same outcome, Heath.""  Immediately after, it feels like <i> Relapse </i>hits something of a stride with ""Beautiful"", the ""what  do I think of success? It sucks"" rant, succeeding despite clichés both  metaphorical (if you're doing ""woe is me,"" pick ""tears of a  clown"" <i>or </i>""walk in my shoes,"" not both) and musical.</p>
<p>It's been easy to rag on the musical  aspect of Eminem's recent output, and the mere fact he's working with Dr. Dre is  seen as cause for celebration (the entirety of ""Old Time's Sake"" is great).   But ever since ""In Da Club"" (and probably <i>because </i> of it), Dre has treated production like a test run for his very  expensive headphones, concerning himself with only the most inert, stainless  steel sounds. But you don't have to be an audiophile to find fault  with the music here-- just a person who has a passing familiarity with  Dre's post-<i>2001 </i>output.  <i>Relapse </i> can be an intermittently thrilling sonic experience until you realize  everything sounds like a variation of ""What's the Difference"",  ""If I Can't"", or even fucking ""30 Something"".  Granted, Eminem  can overpower any beat by sheer force of will, but would it hurt for  it to at least sound fun?</p>
<p>Which is really the reason I can't  truly dig <i>Relapse, </i>even with all the temptation to do so: When  Eminem's <i>on </i>(""Underground"", ""Must Be the Ganja"")-- and  he is more often than he's been since 2002-- he can put you in  an awfully forgiving mood. Sure, the singles end up  being the worst tracks, and it's chocked with filler and has almost  no sense of sequencing, but that's the case with <i>all</i> of his albums. Eminem's always been able to manipulate not only his alter egos but his public persona, but here it feels more forced than ever-- as though, as <i><a href=""http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28771"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Onion</a></i><a href=""http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28771"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> once quipped about a past-his-peak Marilyn Manson</a>, Em's going door to door trying to shock people. Sure, it's great to have the guy back, if only due to the fact that if we get to ignore him for the next four years. But it'll be on our terms, not his.</p></div>"|13034.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13034-relapse/|4.8|Ian Cohen

Within the world of indie rock, he's carved him a niche all his own with clean but inventive production and lyrics that spend much of their time in the heads of unique characters. Vanderslice makes thoroughly modern pop, cut through with concerns about terrorism, disease, our ever-growing distance from nature, and our addiction to mass media. Even without varying his basic formula much, he manages to stay interesting from album to album. <i>Romanian Names</i>, his seventh solo record, is no exception, and it also happens to contain some of the best songs of his career.</p>
<p>Though you'd never guess this was anyone but Vanderslice, and the sound is consistent with earlier records, <i>Romanian Names</i> has a somewhat different feel. The production (a joint venture with long-time collaborator Scott Solter) is as meticulous as ever, but there's something about these songs that feels more natural, as if they took less effort to write but still came out just as good. Perhaps it's simply timing-- Vanderslice has moved well beyond the post-9/11 dread that dominated <i>Pixel Revolt</i> and <i>Emerald City</i>, and his voice seems to appreciate the shift in tone. That's most clearly in evidence in the glowing falsetto harmonies of lead track ""Tremble And Tear"", the most beguiling opener of any of his albums yet. The big, descending melodic hook is joined by a Robert Fripp-ish guitar part, and Vanderslice balances the big vocal with a sparse bassline and sharp drums-- the snare is the only hard sound in an otherwise pillowy song.</p>
<p>The record's second half has some immediately bracing indie-pop songs in the easy-going ""Sunken Union Boat"" and absurdly fluid ""Carina Constellation"", the latter of which features Vanderslice's best self-harmonization on the album, with lyrics that seem to be about two people getting off scot-free for a crime they really committed. Those songs' down-tempo counterparts are often just as good. The title track is sung from the perspective of a man in love with a gymnast whose pressurized life might finally be getting the best of her. The ghostly pulse of ""Forest Knolls"" frames a quiet rumination from Vanderslice as he looks out the window at some deer in the yard, realizing he'd never know what to do if he had to hunt for his own food and lashing himself with guilt for losing the knowledge of his ancestors.</p>
<p>There are plenty more moments to enjoy on <i>Romanian Names</i>, from the bounce of ""C&amp;O Canal"" to the electro campfire sing-along of ""D.I.A.L.O."", the slow back-to-nature majesty of ""Too Much Time"" and the lonely cello that closes the album. Vanderslice hasn't made a bad record, but he's only made a couple that are this good. If you've never dipped an ear into his world before, <i>Romanian Names</i> is a great place to do it.</p></div>"|13002.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13002-romanian-names/|7.8|Joe Tangari

Don't worry, you didn't sleep through anything: White Rabbits were Brooklyn-via Columbia, <i>Missouri</i>, not University, and their pop was big and brassy instead of mellow and breezy. They might have been more Walkmen than Whit Stillman, but White Rabbits knew how to be formal, nonetheless. <i>Fort Nightly </i>was an assured, occasionally very good debut, but it was also just stylistically traditionalist enough to render it somewhat anonymous in relation to the trendier members of the attention economy.</p>
<p>Enter Britt Daniel, and meet <i>It</i>'<i>s Frightening</i>. When White Rabbits started thinking about recording their second album, they'd been friendly with the guys in Spoon for a while, and even a slight listen to <i>Nightly</i> suggests Daniel saw tons of raw material to work with. And work he did: Daniel didn't just produce <i>Frightening</i>, he served as its songwriting Svengali from the earliest stages, cutting <i>Nightly</i>'s urbane pop with the cryptic artiness of <i>Gimme Fiction</i>. Daniel's ghost lingers particularly strongly on ""Lionesse"", ""They Done Wrong/We Done Wrong"", and ""The Salesman (Tramp Life)"", which casual fans could be excused for confusing with actual Spoon songs. All the elements are here: the <i>in medias res</i> studio chatter and expressionistic, dubby sound effects; the gloomy, resonant left-hand piano chords; the clippy acoustic guitars. Singer Stephen Patterson-- whose vocals are less impressive than on the debut-- even rolls the occasional consonant and slips seamlessly into a near-falsetto at appropriate moments. They're painting with the grain a bit, but that's okay: It's a good trail to walk down, and White Rabbits show themselves as eager, attentive prodigies.</p>
<p>Like <i>Fiction</i>, and apropos of its title, <i>Frightening</i> can be dark and cavernous when it wants to. Indeed, it's that Poe-ish sense of lonesome, luxurious dread threading through the record that separates it most starkly from <i>Nightly</i>. Patterson cries out for someone to just <i>listen</i> to him, he dreams of the curtains catching fire and lighting up the room, he focuses on the vent of light spreading across the floor from under the doorway. The eerie, solemn vibe swallows <i>Frightening</i> as it closes, when ""The Lady Vanishes"" and ""Leave It at the Door"" dive deeply into the shadows, letting the album slowly dissolve out like a lengthy crane shot slowly tracking backwards.  At the end of a record that clocks in at just over a half-hour, though, I will admit to checking my watch once or twice in the last few minutes.</p>
<p>I was antsy only because the rest of the album had packed such a punch to that point, though. <i>Frightening</i> often sounds spooked, but the guys are still as cocksure as prizefighters, most of their arrangements packing enough polyrhythms for three regular songs. They come out swinging from the opening bell on ""Percussion Gun"", one of this year's best-yet opening tracks. Under the surface, it's a simple song about crumbling relationships, with clever lyrics (""Where do you get off/ And how can I get there, too?""). The band hits first with the arrangement, though, weaving a seething guitar/piano combo in and out of an incessant floor-tom rhythm redolent of Adam &amp; the Ants' ""Kings of the Wild Frontier"". ""Gun"" segues perfectly into ""Rudie Fails"", which keeps pushing forward, but with a broader purpose. Playing his Clash card before cashing out, Patterson sighs, ""While everyone's duking it out and taking names/ Well, I'll just take a number,"" before proclaiming over and over, ""I don't care at all!"" It's a way of making punk nihilism sound... strangely manageable, but this sort of refraction is the register in which White Rabbits work best. The script might contain plenty of familiar elements, but they're ably, and occasionally superbly, shuffled and recast.</p></div>"|13038.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13038-its-frightening/|7.4|Eric Harvey

You could make the same criticisms of it that guys like me tend to make of Jeffrey Lewis-- the recording is almost entirely a delivery system for the words, it's hard to imagine anyone listening to it just for the sounds, and his voice mostly sticks to one or two notes-- but it also happens to be one of my favorite tracks of 2008. Music doesn't have to be about pure sound; used to be it was about emotional connection, too.</p>
<p>""I still don't have a cell phone/ But this seashell gets reception,"" Lewis sings on ""To Be Objectified"", a surf-splashed meditation from the neurotic New York singer/songwriter's latest album, <i>'Em Are I</i>. Like Richman, Lewis is a sharp firsthand observer of what passes for urban bohemia, but one who still puts warts-and-all sincerity before hipster chic. It's an approach that can lead to uneven results, including Lewis' grossly misguided <i>12 Crass Songs</i> covers disc in 2007. If you're reading this far, though, then Lewis (also, incidentally, an accomplished cartoonist) probably has at least a few songs that will resonate with you.</p>
<p>As on 2006's <i>City &amp; Eastern Songs</i>, Lewis' fourth album of original material again connects best through lyrical details. For instance, Lewis describes the way ""a rolled sweatshirt makes the window soft"" on ""Roll Bus Roll"", the album's lush, loping ramshackle-folk reverie about having too much past and leaving the city behind. Wesley Willis never had a Greyhound bus ride like this. The garage-rockers aren't far behind, whether Lewis is mustering up an unusual degree of self-confidence on opener ""Slogans"" (""Everyone you meet is not better than you"") or extending a sadomasochistic but evocative relationship metaphor on ""Broken Broken Broken Heart"". If the arrangements aren't special in their own right, ""Well, it's hard to get too bored/ When you pick the right two chords,"" as Lewis murmurs on ""If Life Exists (?)"", before discovering that no number of girlfriends will make him happier.</p>
<p>But graveyard hoedown ""Whistle Past the Graveyard"" almost ruins some relatively droll commentary about the afterlife with bah-ing backing vocals. Barnyard themes also sink the Pearls Before Swine in-joke on ""Good Old Pig, Gone to Avalon"". Eight-minute jazz-noise freakout ""The Upside-Down Cross"" eventually gets to lyrics about traveling with various women, but it's not worth the trip; finale ""Mini-Theme = Moocher From the Future"" mistakes ""yesterday to no-terday"" for a clever pun. So <i>'Em Are I</i> is a frontloaded album. But anyone who ever bought a Sebadoh record despite really liking only Lou Barlow's songs should still consider checking it out. (You can prefer Eric Gaffney's songs, that's okay, but not me.)</p></div>"|13006.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13006-em-are-i/|6.3|Marc Hogan

Rosemead resident Christopher Curtis Smith's Night Control project nevertheless seems to have tapped some kind of underground spring of hip influences. A non-exhaustive-- but definitely exhausting-- roll call of listener-reported RIYLs includes: My Bloody Valentine, David Byrne, Brian Eno, Pavement, Kurt Vile, the Microphones, Ariel Pink, Sebadoh, Neil Young, Cheap Trick, Wavves, Olivia Tremor Control, the Jesus and Mary Chain, the Velvet Underground (inevitable), and Michael Jackson (not so much). If you hadn't heard a note of the 19-track, 74-minute debut loooong-player <i>Death Control</i>, you'd be forgiven for expecting an overflowing sonic rubbish tip.</p>
<p>Sure, Night Control makes the new wave of noise bands (including L.A.-proper cool kids No Age and Abe Vigoda) seem like champions of coherence and clean production. And considering that<i> Death Control</i> compiles tracks cherry-picked by label Kill Shaman from a decade's worth of unreleased CD-Rs, I suspect that, left to his own devices, Smith boasts the same self-editing skills as Robert Pollard or Ryan Adams. But there's some method to this madness (besides a presumably awesome record collection). Neat pop containers keep Night Control's frothy blender drinks of synthesized instruments, distorted vocals, field recordings, and playback flotsam from spilling all over the place. For its disheveled strumming, sci-fi sound effects, and OCDed shaker, a track like ""Star 129"" is a traditionally structured composition whose songcraft and melody only become sharper and more poignant on repeat listens. ""Good Looks""' intro of listless beats and surging guitar gives way to the album's most winsome pop song, and white-boy bluesy ""Star 131"" sounds like a 3 a.m. cover of a lost Led Zeppelin ballad, replete with drunk, heartsick Robert Plant impersonation.</p>
<p>Don't ask me if Night Control's lyrics make good on the music's soulful sounds, because Smith's vocals are machine manipulated beyond my patience for transcription. Unlike the vast majority of bedroom recorders, Smith doesn't seem keen to share his specific pain (to which I say, <i>thank you, dude!</i>). In fact, some of the album's best efforts, ""Two Hard"" and ""You're Nine"", are virtual instrumentals, sequenced for maximum effect to provide a respite from chaotic tunes like the Alan-Vega-stranded-in-a-Texas-roadhouse pastiche, ""Know Thy Peasant"". Despite its carnival pleasures, ""Peasant"" brings me back to <i>Death Control</i>'s most intriguing artistic choice and biggest shortcoming-- after their third or fourth appearance, the massively reverbed vocals lose their intimacy.</p>
<p>It's tempting to declare such art-school tendencies, especially in light of Smith's gift for hooks, pretentious. Yet his obvious enthusiasm and dedication to assembling such intricate mixes scuttles that argument. Eight-and-a-half-minute closer ""For the Lanes"" pits a spoken-word track against a funeral organ, finger-picked guitar, and what sounds like construction work, continually frustrating melodic or narrative thread-picking, yet mysteriously coalescing into passages of haunting beauty. I could mention John Fahey's tape collages or rattle off a dozen other reference points. But that would only obscure the fact that Night Control is a strong and original new voice in its own right.</p></div>"|13039.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13039-death-control/|7.2|Amy Granzin

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>It's tempting to say that <i>Animal Crack Box </i></span><span>is for Animal Collective diehards only. In one sense, it's true-- the 1,000 copies of this 3xLP set were likely snapped up by the most committed and in-the-know fans. But its musical appeal might seem limited too, at least at first glance. <span>The set is closest in style to two of the band's earliest, strangest releases, records they made when they were bubbling under from basement electronic and noise circles: 2002's <i>Hollinndagain</i>, a free-form collage of loops, chants, and ambience grafted together from live performances, and 2003's <i>Campfire Songs</i>, eerie acoustic improvisations recorded on a rural Maryland porch and drenched in the sounds of rain, wind, and chirping birds. In short, this is Animal Collective at a time when their peers were Black Dice at </span><i>their</i><span> most avant-garde and bands on Load Records; a time when they were a largely experimental concern far away from the worlds of songs like ""Fireworks"" and ""My Girls"".</span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>But even at its roughest, this inventive collection always sounds like Animal Collective, in ways any fan will recognize. Many of the signature elements they continue to rely on-- soaring vocals, repetitive rhythms, childlike melodies, buzzing electronics, eerie acoustics-- are in full bloom here. And though the set consists of material from their infancy (2000-2003), it sounds less embryonic than lab-like, as if their musical nucleus was there from the start, and their task was not to build a core but rearrange those atoms into infinite mutations.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Much of that effect is due to excellent selection and sequencing. The band sifted through hundreds of live recordings and practice tapes, and divided the chosen material-- about 90 minutes worth-- into six cohesive, era-specific sides. Side B, for example, offers murky textures from the trio of Avey Tare, Panda Bear, and Geologist around the time of <i>Hollinndagain</i></span><span>; Side C, acoustic essays by Avey and Panda in the vein of <i>Campfire Songs;</i></span><span> and side E, full-quartet trance-rock later perfected on 2003's <i>Here Comes the Indian</i></span><span>. The result is wide variety that's rarely schizophrenic. Each side plays like a short story, and the shifts from heavy din to lonely plucks to whooping jams feel natural, much as they have across the band's career as a whole.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>The variety also gives <i>Animal Crack Box </i></span><span>a mood-ring quality. Which side you prefer will depend on which side of the band you like most, and maybe even on your state of mind. I'm partial to the noisier, denser material found on Side E-- particularly the fuzzy version of <i>Indian</i></span><span>'s <i> </i></span><span>""Hey Light""-- and Side A, which peaks when the frenetic ""Ahhh Good Country"" (originally heard on 2001's <i>Danse Manatee</i></span><span>) bleeds into the acidic march-band beat of ""Iko Ovo"". </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>But the other end of the set's spectrum is just as entrancing. Take Side C, in which Avey and Panda trade patient vocals and sparse acoustic guitars, recalling the basement hymns of fellow East Coast experimental psych lords<span> Tower Recordings. At side's end, a shorter take on <i>Campfire Songs' </i></span><span>""De Soto De Son"" sounds like a melodic version of Finnish avant-folk. That vibe is matched by the strum-happy Side F, taken mostly from the Avey/Panda duo tours that preceded the release of 2004's <i>Sung Tongs</i></span><span>. Those shows proved Animal Collective could sound just as surreal and hypnotic using simple acoustics as they could with electrified overload.<span> </span>Here we get a warped, back-and-forth take on ""Who Could Win a Rabbit"" and the hissy, Daniel Johnston-like spook of ""Mouth Wooed Her"".</span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Other sides seem less essential, but none are boring</span><span>. The predominant feel is meditative, sometimes gentle, catching the vibe of shows that even at their weirdest were, in person, user-friendly. <span>Those séance-like gigs often involved tribal beats, absurd masks, primal chants, and other ritualistic qualities designed to engage those in the room. The Animal Collective of the early 2000s could evoke a more spiritual version of the Sun City Girls, a modern take on Faust and Amon Düül, or a less arty descendent of the Residents-- <span>but, as <i>Animal Crack Box </i></span><span>shows, the band offered a sunnier, more inclusive aura than any of those influences.</span></span></span></p>
<!--StartFragment--><!--EndFragment-->
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>None of this is news-- t</span><span>he periods and styles covered on </span><i>Animal Crack Box</i><span> have all popped up on previous releases. In that sense, it's simply a welcome addition to Animal Collective's rich body of work. But these are the rawest, most immediate glimpses of the band to date, stripped of the precision afforded by studio revision. If some of it sounds hazy, well, freeze frames from fast-moving films tend to look a little blurry, and <i>Animal Crack Box </i></span><span>vividly demonstrates how this band and its music are always a work in progress.</span></p>

Their choices for the second volume of the <i>Kitsuné Tabloid</i> series--  following Digitalism's 2008 mix-- one might assume would play  on this aesthetic, out-cooling listeners with obscurant or ultra-hip  selections.  Instead, Phoenix turn in a modest and loving mixtape  full of songs aimed at pricking ears rather than popping eyeballs. <i>Kitsuné  Tabloid</i> openly displays Phoenix's love for all manners of charming,  offbeat music: There's precious little crate-digging,  in part because even if the average Phoenix fan doesn't know a lick  about Tangerine Dream or the Red Krayola, it's likely that your average Kitsuné consumer does.</p>
<p>If <i>Tabloid</i> has a discernible  theme, it's probably Phoenix's reverence for early rock'n'soul,  as the mix touches on not just the Impressions but Ritchie Valens, Irma  Thomas, Dusty Springfield, and like-minded imitators Elvis Costello,  Chris Bell (Big Star), and Dennis Wilson.  Major stylistic diversions  include R&amp;B, Brazilian pop, and indie rock, but there's plenty  of wiggle room to be had in that first list, and <i>Tabloid</i> never  feels monotonous or truly predictable.</p>
<p><i>Kitsuné</i><i> Tabloid</i> is weighed down  by one or two too many long tracks, which makes it a little bit like  a Phoenix album anyway.  But even at its most tedious, <i>Tabloid </i> exposes commonalities between unlike partners, its careful sequencing  revealing the swooning overlap between Costello's ""Shipbuilding""  and D'Angelo's ""Send It On"", or the fever-dreams shared by the  Red Krayola's ""Victory Garden"" and the Impressions' ""I've  Been Trying"".  <i>Tabloid</i> even stumbles into the sublime,  such as when its final coupling, Springfield's take on ""I Think It's  Gonna Rain Today""-- and its keystone line, ""Human kindness  is overflowing""-- and Lou Reed's ""Street Hassle"", dovetail into  a warming thematic climax.   Phoenix even manage to freshen  up the 13th Floor Elevators' ""I Had to Tell You"" and  Wilson's ""Lady (Falling in Love)"", divorcing those songs from  their often weighty contexts (though even four fashionable French rockers  can't repurpose Urge Overkill, arguably this mix's most surprising  selection).</p>
<p>It's (only) a little unfair to read  Phoenix's style in these choices-- this is a mixtape, not a list of  influences-- but <i>Tabloid</i> does seem to favor long, pretty songs  that eschew rigidity in favor of strands of repeated melody.  See:  Chris Bell's ""I Am the Cosmos"", Costello's ""Shipbuilding"",  or Roxy Music's ""Pyjamarama"".  Instrumental choices like  Tangerine Dream's ""Love on a Real Train"" or Iggy Pop and James  Williamson's ""Master Change"" are fitting for a band whose albums  often include at least one mostly wordless epic. <i>Tabloid</i> only occasionally feels  self conscious or over-considered, such as during its opening two songs,  Kiss' instrumental ""Love Theme From <i>Kiss</i>"" and the Dirty Projectors  ""Rise Above"", an awesome track that nonetheless carries an air of  hot'n'now cred that the rest of the compilation avoids.</p>
<p>But more than flashy or progressive  or obscure, <i>Tabloid</i> feels considerate, at least as considerate  as a mixtape made by four strangers for <i>Vice</i>-magazine readers  can be.  There are blatant stylistic disconnects in the sequencing;  there are some long songs, silly songs, bad songs, and at least one  song you've probably not heard (for me: Lo Borges' ""Aos Baroes"").    All of this makes it very much like a mixtape one of your friends might  pass you, which sort of suppresses my jetsetting fantasies as I pull over into an off-highway Chick-fil-a.</p></div>"|13024.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13024-kitsune-tabloid/|7.0|Andrew Gaerig

James is describing his first meeting ""in a couple of years"" with Graham Coxon, the woohooing Britpop survivors' then-estranged guitarist. That passage was yet another reason for dedicated followers of the band to keep betting on a full Blur reunion, now official. It also gives you a pretty good idea what you can expect from Coxon's seventh solo album: same bittersweet bundle of misery, posher palate.</p>
<p>Coxon is not normally a guy you turn to for easy cubicle listening. In Blur, he was the punkish pedal-stomper with the noisy American indie-rock collection and skateboarding hobby. After <i>Parklife</i> turned the group into pop idols, Coxon was the one who reacted with Kurt Cobain-ish dismay. As a solo artist, he has alternated between post-punk squall and folkie plaintiveness starting with 1998's extremely lo-fi<i> Sky Is Too High</i>-- like so many of the records he would've heard on John Peel's radio show, it was self-released. Longtime Blur producer Stephen Street has helped steer Coxon toward more broadly accessible power-pop on recent albums, most successfully 2004's <i>Happiness in Magazines</i>, without ever quite going middle of the road.</p>
<p><i>The Spinning Top</i> crashes into the median, and it barely budges for almost 70 trudging minutes. Blur are doing what every once-profitable band does these days-- hi, Led Zeppelin!-- and getting back together. Coxon is doing what so many other formerly fun musicians end up doing once they've exhausted their Satan-bestowed allotment of decent melodies and lyrics: Yes, it's some kind of concept album, apparently telling the story of a man's life from birth to death, though you wouldn't necessarily know it. Street produces again, and Robyn Hitchcock is among the guests, but even they can't make up for repetitive, one-dimensional songs-- mostly sleepy folk, occasionally fuzzy psych. If the sound quality is more consistent than in Coxon's rough early work, that just means when he stretches threadbare ideas past the breaking point, he'll be less likely to wake you.</p>
<p>One thing intact: Coxon's guitar-playing. If his nuanced and head-smackingly emotive fretwork with Blur hasn't already convinced you he's among his generation's great guitarists, the sinuous finger-picking on otherwise fairly forgettable first single ""Sorrow's Army"" should send you back to ""This Is a Low"", ""Sing"", or ""Bugman"" with fresh ears. Coxon recently told <i>Uncut </i>he's a big fan of English folk guitar gods Bert Jansch, Davy Graham, and Martin Carthy, and he's certainly playing in their style here. On ""Perfect Love"", Coxon's folk-filigreed acoustic figure joins various Indian instruments to back double-tracked doggerel lyrics vaguely reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe's ""Annabel Lee"". ""Tripping Over"" is an interminable lullaby, but that electric guitar is sure purdy for the last minute or two.</p>
<p>Listeners who've heard only Coxon's last couple of rockers, including 2006's <i>Love Travels at Illegal Speeds</i>, might not've been aware of his folkie streak, but it's been almost as much of an open secret as the fact Blur were eventually gonna reunite. ""I wish I could bring Nick Drake back to life,"" Coxon sang on his first non-Blur single, ""I Wish"". At least back then he had enough faith in his own lo-fi vision not actually to bite the late English folkie-- he left that to Beck. It's hard to imagine the Coxon of a decade ago singing phrases like ""baybay"" over rootsy verses in between ornamented choruses that get all <i>Bryter Layter</i> about the rain (except in jest, a la Blur B-side ""Rednecks""). Likewise, opener ""Look Into the Light"" is nice enough, emphasizing the guitar's droning harmonics, but I can't decide if I just like it because the melody reminds me of Drake's ""Cello Song"". Joined by upright bass and piano on tracks like ""Feel Alright"", which is as bland as its title, <i>The Spinning Top</i> comes closer to Van Morrison, specifically <i>Astral Weeks Live at the Hollywood Bowl</i>. In that case, the slow-motion classical guitar licks on ""Far From Everything"" are ""Beside You"" all by its lonesome.</p>
<p>Coxon's main Blur songs, ""You're So Great"" and ""Coffee &amp; TV"", could go as long as six minutes without a single wasted note. <i>The Spinning Top</i> keeps spinning its wheels. Second single ""In the Morning"" sounds like the Beatles' ""Blackbird"" if it had gone on for eight minutes and if Paul had let George arrange-- not just because Coxon mentions a blackbird, either. ""If a diamond hangs in every tree and a life is lost for every leaf can a bird still sing?"" he asks. Beats me. Even when the Blur guitarist reminds us that he knows where Syd Barrett lives, as on ""Caspian Sea"", it's not much more fun than bashing your head against the wall repeating geographical terms until every now and then you see stars. ""It's oh so serious/ It's oh so lame,"" Coxon repeats throughout ""If You Want Me"", occasionally breaking into Pixies-ish distortion-- serious or not, it <i>is</i> kind of lame.</p>
<p>Blur couldn't really be Blur without Coxon. His guitar helps make <i>Modern Life Is Rubbish </i>modern, keeps <i>13</i> from collapsing under its own Donald Duck noises, and steals the show during its one appearance on <i>Think Tank</i>. No <i>Blur</i> without him, either. But it's Damon Albarn who has had the band's most successful solo career, outselling Blur with Gorillaz and going on to even more artistically impressive work with the Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen and then Monkey. James has been writing a weekly newspaper column; drummer Dave Rowntree went into politics. It's probably no coincidence that the song here most worthy of Coxon's past work is called ""Humble Man"". As James's memoir puts it, Coxon is ""brilliantly artistic, but vulnerable."" He's still my favorite Blur.</p></div>"|13047.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13047-the-spinning-top/|4.7|Marc Hogan

It's truly great that the reunion of brothers Curt and Cris Kirkwood-- long delayed by addiction, prison, and general interpersonal mayhem-- has become an ongoing concern. Two albums in three years, and a healthy touring schedule: That's an admirable work rate even before you take the struggles of the recent past into account.</p>
<p>But Cris' return to the fold, while hopefully a positive development for the brothers' relationship, has yet to fully revivify the Puppets' work. Like its predecessor, 2007's <i>Rise to Your Knees</i>, <i>Sewn Together</i> is competent psych-tinged rock, with only brief flashes of the zonked vocal and instrumental personality that lit up the band's first few records. Now, the sing-alongs work as such, rather than as inscrutable interpretations of country-pop. The guitar heroics are cleaned up and corralled in outros and breakdowns, rather than ambling from first minute to last in place of hooks (or even riffs). The vocal delivery fits the mood of each song, rather than perversely offering smoked-out murmurs or post-pubescent groans when a croon would better suit.</p>
<p>So <i>Sewn Together</i> is gently rustic, occasionally (a bit) heavier than you might expect, and ready for any adult-leaning-but-alternative-friendly playlist. It's also pretty bland, and at worst banally melodramatic in ways that suggest the unfortunate arrival of the Meat Puppets power ballad. The piano and Spanish guitar of ""Sapphire"" are prime-time soap unctuous; ""Go to Your Head"" features possibly the most timid guitar solo Curt Kirkwood's ever played, and well-wrought harmonies in service of a chorus you'll forget two tracks later. Sure, no one but the delusional should be expecting (or desiring) a return to the violent ineptitude of ""In a Car"", but <i>Sewn Together</i>'s weaker tunes feel too fussed-over and misguidedly concerned with middling displays of craft.</p>
<p>But once intimidatingly idiosyncratic to teenage punks used to easy-to-replicate hardcore, the Meat Puppets had been transforming into something more alt-rock normative well before their breakup. Perhaps fans should best approach any new Puppets material as a chance to hear two long-estranged musicians revel in rediscovered chops, while enjoying the occasional playful nod to past excesses. Like the way the hazy, high-speed ""I'm Not You"" prettifies the thrashing bluegrass of <i>Meat Puppets II</i>, or the way the final minutes of ""The Monkey and the Snake"" recall the placid acid-folk wonders of <i>Up on the Sun</i>. Listening to these moments, you can't help but hope the brothers will loosen up a bit next time out.</p></div>"|13035.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13035-sewn-together/|6.1|Jess Harvell

And over the course of four albums, the now full-time project of ex-A Frames drummer Lars Finberg has loosened up its formative post-punk pessimism to the point that the band's chosen MySpace URL-- www.myspace.com/theworldisadrag-- feels more ironic with each record. Rather than simply protest the indignities of modern life, on <i>Fake Surfers</i>, Finberg goes about creating a sanctuary from it, inviting in friends from fellow unsung West Coast indie rock acts (and, in one instance, covering their songs) to form a secret, protective society that will ensure the survival of rational-thinking species in a world where brain cells are being eroded 140 characters at a time.</p>
<p>The Intelligence's previous release, 2007's <i>Deuteronomy</i>, was notable for its more focused songcraft and cleaner presentation, but <i>Fake Surfers</i> doesn't continue these new adventures in hi-fi. Rather, it plays to the Intelligence's extremes, casting a more pronounced British Invasion pop influence in warped, peak-level lo-fi sonics, emphasizing a connection between post-punk and psychedelia that stretches from Clinic and Guided by Voices through the deconstructionist pop of Swell Maps and Wire and back to the whimsical wordsmithery of Syd Barrett and Skip Spence. (That said, <i>Fake Surfers</i> practically sounds like <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i> compared to <i>Crepuscule With Pacman</i>, a concurrently released collection of more discordant, half-formed material issued via French indie Born Bad.)</p>
<p><i>Fake Surfers</i>' noise/pop affinities seemingly align it with the current lo-fi vogue fostered by Slumberland and Slitbreeze Records sets, with the tambourine-rattled ""Taxman"" strut of ""Tower"" and bobble-headed harmonies of ""Universal Babysitter"" suggesting mid-1960s Beatles had they been signed to Rough Trade Records in 1978. But the Intelligence are distinguished by the way they push the limits of their claustrophobic space; their most intriguing moments often result when they lay off the distortion pedal, exposing the creepy voices and radio frequencies that overwhelm the swinging-60s go-go groove of ""Saint Bartolomeu"" and the circular circus melodies driving the electro-stroll of ""I Hear Depression"". And while it seems like faint praise to say the best song on <i>Fake Surfers</i> is its lone cover, the breezily strummed rendition of L.A. new-wave hot dogs Wounded Lion's ""Pony People"" feels like the song Finberg's been waiting to sing his whole life. Lord knows what it says about the man that he's never sounded happier than when singing from the perspective of a centaur ""firing arrows into rabbits."" But in the case of <i>Fake Surfers</i>, such emotional breakthroughs are worth sacrificing a bunny or two.</p></div>"|13021.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13021-fake-surfers/|7.3|Stuart Berman

This has worked out extremely well for not only  people who were cheap before it somehow became cool, but unexpectedly,  for many rappers who have either passed their commercial peak or never  really experienced one in the first place.  No longer cowed by  unrealistic expectations, either self-imposed or label-imposed, guys  like Scarface, Styles P, Beanie Sigel, Freeway, Slim Thug, and Jim Jones are putting out highly enjoyable, no-frills records with low overhead, proving  all along that some rappers just need a decent beat and everyone else  to stay out of their way.</p>
<p><i>Crime Pays </i> all but confirms that Cam'ron is not one of those rappers.  Over  the past half-year or so, leaks like ""I Hate My Job"" and ""Get It in Ohio"" suggested a possibility of a <i>The</i> <i>Wrestler-</i>style comeback narrative that derived power from admitting how far its protagonist had fallen.  Instead, <i>Crime Pays</i> has a lonely,  defensive, and vaguely desperate Kirk Van Houten vibe-- more noticeable  than a lack of breakout bangers or guest spots (though you gotta wonder  how 40 Cal was the biggest name to clear his schedule for the first  Cam'ron record in three years) is a palpable and inexcusable lack  of excitement and spark.  Killa could stand to borrow a feeling.</p>
<p>Seems like any time Cam isn't  able to shout out the names of every inaugural member of DipSet, he  retreats into the sort of insular (not to be confused with impulsive  or impenetrable-- that would be more interesting) bad habits he's picked  up since <i>Purple Haze </i>became arguably the last definitive document  of popular New York rap.  Earlier in the decade, beats from Just  Blaze, Kanye, and Heatmakerz provided exquisite and posh soundtracks  that added extra shine to Cam's theater of the absurd.  But whether  it's a reduced budget or his increased need to show allegiance to the Sun Belt states, Cam outsources most of <i>Crime Pays</i> to Araabmuzik  and Skitzo. They contribute mixtape-quality music that goes heavy on repetitive <i> Psycho</i> strings and incessantly ticking 16th-note hi-hats but ultimately has about as much low end as a Junior Senior record.</p>
<p>And not that I'd expect the guy who penned lines like ""take it in your  ass-- how 'bout 30 grams?"" and the entirety of ""Stop Calling""  to give the most positive spin on gender relations, but even after all  the poisonous misogyny we've heard Cam deal in up to this point, ""You  Know What's Up"" and ""Cookies &amp; Apple Juice"" are so mirthlessly  repulsive that ""Bottom of the Pussy"" somehow becomes, like, the  fifth-most offensive song on <i>Crime Pays. </i> At least Cam seems amused with himself on that track, which also explains  how the comic high point of <i>Crime  Pays </i>is a two-minute skit wherein Cam'ron threatens to shit in  a woman's car-- it's a veritable Easter Egg for people who remember  his second verse on ""Dead Muthafuckas"".</p>
<p>Of course, when Cam disappears  headlong up his own assonance (no ho-millz, as he helpfully instructs  throughout) it's still incredibly entertaining.  Even within  the tightest rhyme stricture, his gamesmanship in spooling vowel sounds  fascinates.  Cam'ron's one of those kind of guys where you  could read his lyrics on paper and know exactly how it sounds. If only his lyrics and cadence weren't saddled with  such shabby beats-- even as they contain some of the least imaginative  lines on <i>Crime Pays</i>, the relative levity of kiddie beats like  ""Never Ever"", ""Silky (No Homo)"", and ""Whoo Hoo"" feels welcome.</p>
<p>And then there's ""Hate  My Job"". Killa's relationship with reality is so dysfunctional  that his most ""normal"" songs tend to be his weirdest, especially  when he tries to make an honest connection: the maybe-sincere love letter  ""Daydreamin'"", ""I.B.S."" (that's irritable bowel syndrome).  It's  hard to say what could have inspired this unusually human and empathetic  moment-- ""Ay yo, I hate my boss/ Dude think he know it all/ And I know  I know it all/ But I follow protocol."" It's typical Cam smirk, and  really the last bit of self-respect he can dredge up before a host of  travails break him down, from everyday nuisances (""That's why I  light the sour before I hit the office/ Being here eight hours sure get  you nauseous"") to the very real hopelessness befalling someone with  a checkered past (""You're working on my future/ Why you calling out  my history?"").</p>
<p>As bizarre as it initially  seems for a rapper like Cam'ron to go in character as a working stiff, it's not unprecedented-- in fact, the soundtrack for <i> Office Space </i>had <i>two </i>such instances, from Canibus and Kool  Keith. The latter's shadow paradoxically hangs heavy over <i>Crime  Pays</i>-- shortly after <i>Dr. Octagonecologyst </i> broke him with the indie set<i>, </i> Keith was also making intermittently enjoyable records centered around  NBA namedrops, poop jokes, and the fine distinction between ""alien""  and ""alienating.""  It's a slippery slope Cam would be well-advised  to study, since on four separate ""Fuck Cam"" skits, a bunch of crotchety  haters talk shit about his lemonhead earrings, floor-length minks, and  his pink and purple pioneering.  In their minds, Cam's done nothing  worth really mentioning since 2005, and <i>Crime Pays</i> often makes you  wonder if they've got a point.</p></div>"|13029.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13029-crime-pays/|5.7|Ian Cohen

""We always drew people down the middle,""  El-P remarked <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/34613-company-flow-talk-ifuncrusher-plusi-reissue/"" target=""_blank"">in an interview with Pitchfork earlier this year</a>.  ""There were never people who were like 'Eh, it's all right.' It  was either 'I wanna find those guys and beat them senseless because  their crazy noise is hurting me' or 'This is fucking incredible.'""  But despite their divisive reputation, Company Flow had an important  role as one of the last crucial bridges between the East Coast hardcore  battle rap of the 1990s and the deep-end abstraction that was to follow  in the transition from underground hip-hop to ""indie rap"". It's  the kind of rap that was out-there enough to be aggressively polarizing,  yet true enough to the game that no less a classicist than DJ Premier  co-signed it.</p>
<p>Looking back at the tracks  that first appeared on 1996's <i>Funcrusher </i> EP and the additional material that supplemented it on <i>Funcrusher  Plus </i>a year later, you can hear where many of those space-rap  acolytes of the late 90s got their motivation (even if they frequently  picked up their verbosity without retaining their b-boy bonafides).  But you can also hear the precedents, harbored in the grimy beats and  cipher-based shit-talk that has a stylistic younger-brother kinship  with the likes of Organized Konfusion, D.I.T.C., and first-wave Wu-Tang.  Now, after a few years in Rawkus-entangled out-of-print limbo, <i>Funcrusher  Plus </i>has been reclaimed by Definitive Jux, brought back in a no-frills  yet still-essential reissue that serves as a valuable reminder of how  advanced MC/producers El-P and Bigg Jus and DJ Mr. Len were at the time-- and, well, now.</p>
<p>If you're more familiar with  their solo work, <i>Funcrusher Plus</i> might be a bit of a surprise  lyrically. There are a few signs of the personal details that'd inform  El-P's later material-- ""Last Good Sleep"", in particular, is  a vivid, stomach-turning account of growing up being kept awake by  domestic violence-- and subtle hints at the more culturally focused  material Bigg Jus would develop in his later career, most clearly in  the recollections of his graf-artist days in ""Lune TNS"". But for  the most part, they're on some wall-to-wall battle-rap punchline business,  and it's crafty, bewildering, repeat-rewind material. There's a  defiantly sick sense of humor all throughout <i>Funcrusher Plus</i>,  starting with the anti-child-molester safety record intro on opening  track ""Bad Touch Example"" and extending through El and Jus' punchlines,  which mash up pop-culture references, conspiracy theories, threats of  physical trauma and independent, anti-industry broadsides into a mutant  strain of hyper-crowded lyricism that borders on information overload.</p>
<p>They're never content to  lay an obvious, straightforward metaphor on the table; where average  MCs might claim they ""shine like a light bulb,"" Bigg Jus' showcase  verse on ""Silence"" has him ""encased in a glass dome, I pull mikes  like filaments/ I'm tungsten, light within that causes somethin'."" If that reads like a parody of backpacker wordiness, on record it sounds  like verbal swordsmanship. Other punchlines are a bit more to-the-point  but no less audacious: ""I see through pussy like the invisible woman""  (El-P on ""Blind""); ""MCs couldn't hang if they was lynched by  the Grand Dragon"" (Bigg Jus on ""8 Steps to Perfection""); ""Even  when I say nothing it's a beautiful use of negative space"" (El-P on  ""The Fire in Which You Burn""). But even more pivotal to their style  than their punchlines is the way they're thrown at you: relentlessly,  with a minimum of setup, weaving between clarity and abstraction until  the two of them are blurred. Both Jus and El have deliveries that switch  from traditional on-the-beat flow to a manic, hectoring semi-conversational  tirade when you least expect it, a technique even more indicative of  their anti-commercial stance than their prevalent fuck-a-label rhymes.  It's all so dense and serpentine and intricate that pretty much every  single attempt to transcribe it has left <i>Funcrusher Plus</i>' Original  Hip-Hop Lyrics Archives entries riddled with question marks and mistakes.  Twelve years and dozens upon dozens of listens after first buying it,  I'm still catching new details.</p>
<p>And aside from the lyrical  epiphanies you might get from return visits, the other reason to keep <i> Funcrusher Plus </i>on rotation is its production, which boasts some  of the most oxidized, tetanus-infected doom-rap beats of the era. With  the exception of the nocturnal crystalline funk of the Bigg Jus-produced  ""Lune TNS"" and the frequent scratch contributions from secret weapon  DJ Mr. Len, <i>Funcrusher Plus</i>' beats bear the mark of El-P's  dusty-but-digital aesthetic, which even back then had the same sort  of beautiful-dystopia <i>Blade Runner </i> feel that informed Cannibal Ox's <i>The Cold Vein </i> and his own <i>Fantastic Damage</i> a few years later. ""Krazy Kings""  and ""Blind"" explode with horn blasts amputated from brassy jazz  and funk and turned into jeering exclamation points, ""Legends"" has  this great woozy-sounding blues-funk lope to it that perfectly evokes  late night smokin'-and-drinkin' surliness, and the vertiginous guitar  loop in ""8 Steps to Perfection"" is such a stark example of psychedelic  horror that sample-spotters might want to start looking in late-60s  LSD-awareness educational films if they want to find its source. But  no matter how close the atmosphere gets to nightmarish slasher-flick  ugliness or bionic space-age futurism, the beats beneath still knock;  everyone remembers that fuck-around-sounding three-note synthesizer  riff from ""Vital Nerve"" but it's laid over this heavy-ass drum  break that makes you want to just punch the hell out of something.</p>
<p>Aside from some subtle remastering  that thankfully still preserves the album's underground grit (like  Bigg Jus' spit-via-intercom presence on ""Krazy Kings""), this edition  of <i>Funcrusher Plus </i>isn't exactly deluxe. Some fans might be  disappointed in this reissue for completist reasons-- it doesn't  include ""Corners '94"", a highlight on the double-LP version, and  there's no bonus disc of fan-favorite post-<i>Funcrusher </i> singles like ""End to End Burners"", ""Simple"", or ""Patriotism"".  But it's still absolutely necessary, and not just for rights-reclamation  reasons. As abrasive and confrontational as this album might've sounded  in the Bentley-buying shiny-suit atmosphere of 1997, <i>Funcrusher Plus </i> seems both more vital and more unfathomable now: vital because its independent-minded  ethos seems to be getting its long-awaited validation in the post-going-diamond  era, and unfathomable because few of its practitioners have been able  to extend this far out into the furthest reaches of abstract lyricism  and still retain that classic b-boy connection.</p></div>"|13019.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13019-funcrusher-plus/|9.0|Nate Patrin

From the thistly early stretches of their new collaboration, it is clear both musicians have an appetite for lo-fi deconstruction, a weakness for austerity, and, in that always refreshing Staubgold spirit, a bottomless well of ideas for the glitch. Ambitiously linking to a grand Western tradition, one broad enough to accommodate both Robin Hood and Casey Jones, the album title <i>Ballads</i> hints at Ehlers' habit of appropriation.</p>
<p>Critics like New York's Jerry Saltz believe that, even today, the concept looms large over the art world, casting a shadow that obscures its values. Certainly, at its bold best, appropriation gave us Warhol and rap: novel creations, biting comments, new avenues for the young to upset the old. But the vigor with which reviewers and consumers lapped it up led to overdemand, then to oversupply, of Xeroxed Pop, overworked breakbeats, by-the-numbers conceptualism. Thus much of the meaning and force once bound up with the act of appropriation-- that sense that no one owned culture, that everyone did, or simply that the wrong people did-- drained away. You could say that the glitch rose to a similar level of prominence as well, before it became part of everyone's schematic edginess. Where it once pointed to the broken promise of technology, or a human presence amid the machines, it eventually turned into a chic shortcut taken by every student of Ben Gibbard or Scott Herren.</p>
<p>Ehlers and Wirkus lobby for a return to the not-so-remote past when both appropriation and the glitch held on to some form of expressive power. Toward the beginning of his career, Ehlers borrowed fragments of Schoenberg and, inspired by the Frankfurt School thinkers, glued them together into gorgeously jarring mosaics. Listeners turned into noticers when they encountered this early work, poring over the textures to connect Ehlers' theory to his practice, in a trend that continued with the train of tributes that make up <i>Plays</i>. There, each composition was prefixed with ""Ekkehard Ehlers Plays..."" and ended with iconic names like Albert Ayler and Robert Johnson, echoing the dramatic marketing of old recordings where a titanic pianist took on a titanic composer (think <i>Horowitz Plays Rachmaninoff</i>). The very opposite of a straightforward interpreter (think Robert Lowell), Ehlers' homages bore only a passing resemblance to the honorees, hewing closer to his own fractured dream logic. In his most explicit reference-- he prefers that term over ""sampling""-- his <i>A Life Without Fear</i> sought to recreate, in its creator's image, the perpetual nightfall of blues music.</p>
<p>Whatever you want to call it-- referencing or sampling-- Ehlers ladles both Alice Coltrane and Henry Flynt into <i>Ballads</i>. In these fleeting studies, it is easy to miss the samples, which either sweep briskly in and out of vision, or shade neatly into the surrounding song. Often the same goes for the guest's instruments, notably Kai Fagaschinksi's clarinet, which can click with the rest of the moving parts into one interlocking whole. The contributions can serve as an invisible foundation at times, as firecracking flourishes at others. (The alternately heavy and light woodwind-string tensions of Politik Braucht Keinen Feind seem to have won Ehlers over.) You can hear Fagaschinki's minimalist presence in ""Bryza"", nicely evoking the breeze of its title. But the dueling double-bass drama carried out by Berlin's Tang and Dafeldecker, of course, is much easier to pick out. On the album's outstanding ""Guma"", the two men have it out, plucking and bowing, before a wild theater of sounds: a boat creak, slashing rotors, pneumatic spray, Wirkus' whisper of tribal drums. There is an ominous hint of violence in every corner of that nearly six-minute scene.</p>
<p>Leaning more toward freeform improvisation, Ehlers goes out of his way to avoid loop structures here-- a decisive break with Wirkus' last two records. In fact, if you trace the flight-path of Wirkus' aesthetic from 2004's <i>Inteletto d'Amore</i> to 2006's <i>Déformation Professionnelle</i>, essentially a Reichian layer cake of MiniDisc loops, an embrace of the near-mystic powers of rhythm seems to be the next stop. On the mysteriously neglected <i>Forest Full of Drums</i> (2008), Wirkus appropriated the rhythms and sounds of nature, dragging a drum kit into the woods. About the outdoor-recording process, Wirkus said: ""Everything was already there. The trees, the wind, the birds, the muddy soil, the undergrowth, playing children, people taking walks, the distant hum of a motorway, and airplanes above. We arrived there as beginners. We had to wait for the right weather."" Uncooperative weather kept Wirkus and Ehlers from repeating this Jewelled Antler style of production. In a way, this method is the extension of Mille Plateaux logic to its absurd extreme: the click, the cut, the glitch send us from the failed machine back to the edenic forms of nature.</p>
<p>So it was no surprise that nature sounds found a way to intrude. The second track, ""Okno"", means ""window"" in Polish and, like the half-curtained panes on the record's cover, it opens up a narrow portal to the outside world. Wirkus is clearly harkening back to his last record, by prominently placing the wind, which sounds like it is flowing through metal chimes, and the birds, a swarm of chirps straight out of Messaien, in his rustic vision. Before long, this daydreamy section gives way to a more surreal blend, as percussive dials and pops swell into a carnivalesque explosion of notes and lowing cattle. Scientific order and detail abounds, but it is balanced by both members' free-jazz passion for chaos (in, for one, the lost-in-space tumult of ""Ruchy"") and drift (perfected in the soothing tremolo of ""Wiem""). This constant motion between precise blitzkrieg and restorative <i>détente</i> sums up the partnership of Ehlers and Wirkus. One small quibble, which also applied to <i>Forest Full of Drums</i>: Almost all of these striking songs could use two or three extra minutes to unfold. Brevity is a virtue, but in the case of these two soundscape architects, listeners will wish the expansive ideas had expansive canvases.</p></div>"|13069.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13069-ballads/|7.9|Roque Strew

Every song of theirs burns bright, blending sordid premises, drunken technique, and the exploded sounds of dive-bar rock'n'roll. The music is being sold, ironically, under the name <i>Free Drugs;-)</i>-- but don't let the adolescent title and cutesy emoticon steer you away. Part of a noisy new crop of revivalists-- the umpteenth generation of Lenny Kaye acolytes-- Harlem's record nevertheless strikes out as a marvel of cartoonishly masculine, crudely analog brevity.</p>
<p>Reviewers have treated the band's professed love of Nirvana as a half-joke, and given their affectedly dumb deflections of interviewers' questions, it's no wonder. But like most in their generation, Harlem's appreciation of Lead Belly can likely be traced to Kurt Cobain's own love for the bluesman, made famous in his unplugged rendition of ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night?"" There are not only echoes of Lead Belly's chorus in Harlem's ""Red Herring"", but hints of Nirvana's noise-pop forebears, Pixies, in the haunting harmonies. Apart from those moody pre- and post-industrial genres, countless others can be spotted: surf rock á la the Ventures, Sun Records rockabilly, and overdriven Detroit proto-punk.</p>
<p>""I'm on Drugs"" crams the fractured pace of junkiedom into two minutes. Fuzzy and brief as the altered states they are singing about, the song has the thickened intensity, to use a more family-friendly metaphor, of a slow gravy reduction. Play ""Witchgreens"" for another instance of the band's inability to waste time: They slap together the bare bones of a pop song, a slinky groove, and a silken shout, and manage to sneak their chorus into your memory. When they demand more room to move, they stretch the track to a relatively epic three minutes in ""South of France"", giving them the precise acreage needed to quarter an army of crazy rhythms, one slyly submerged melody, and an apocalyptic breakdown worthy of Black Francis.</p>
<p>So is it sincere? Are they trying too hard? It is too soon to tell. What cannot be denied, even at this early stage, is the charm behind Harlem's to-hell-with-everything swagger. In songs like ""Beautiful &amp; Very Smart"" and ""Disneyland"", their primitivism extends from sounds to emotions, as they plead sweetly for girls to simply hang around and talk to them. Ultimately, it is hard to judge them against their aesthetic brethren-- Sic Alps, for instance, or the Black Lips-- when chops and studio polish are erased from the equation. Even without clever language or arrangements, their elemental yearning for teenage kicks makes up for that. They may not be adding much to the neo-<i>Nuggets</i> formula, but their channeling of those fuzzed-out relics of rock history is so painstakingly slipshod, so studiedly aggressive, and so exuberantly ominous, that listeners won't give a fig about the lack of novelty.</p></div>"|12891.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12891-free-drugs-/|6.8|Roque Strew

Even the name of Bainbridge's own cultishly admired former group Plone sounded onomatopoeic, like a reference tone seeping out of a 60s-era electronics workshop. The title of the duo's long-simmering first LP, <i>Tomorrow Today</i>, signals the same sort of retro-futurism, but they're pulling from a slightly different palette.</p>
<p>Deciphering that palette is part of the fun, too. Plone's geekily majestic sci-fi mini symphonies barely register, and Broadcast's glassy analog grooves are all but invisible. Felton and Bainbridge named the project after track two from <i>Neu! '75</i>, and while there's a whiff of that song's guitar tone and sterile atmosphere, they're content to double-time its tempo-- only two songs on <i>Tomorrow</i> crack the four-minute mark. Hell, with the exception of the <i>Switched On</i> organeering of ""Captured"", if someone were to play me <i>Tomorrow</i> blindly, and tell me that it's ""Gruff Rhys making a Joe Meek tribute album,"" I wouldn't bat an eyelash. Felton's vocals distinctly recall Rhys' warm, fuzzy timbre; the songs-- at least on the first half of the record-- are immaculate, hook-laden new wave; and there's enough studio flim-flammery to drive me toward eBay and YouTube for a Meek fix.</p>
<p>At its best, <i>Tomorrow Today</i> is top-notch romantic synth-pop with a weirdo edge.  There's nothing  paradigm-shifting here, but these two have never been known for reinventing  the wheel as much as finding new ways to make antique wheels roll. The  love songs are the best songs: ""Turnaround"" is gothy and gossamer,  billowing synths surrounding a sunny-but-bashful melody that only slightly  rises out of its daydream for the chorus, and ""Captured"" sets some  punny Numan/Kraftwerkisms (""I will not be turned off"") to an upshifted  tempo and a rhythm bed set to puree.  But there's a darker side,  too.  Opener ""Burning Pages"" may burst out of its dispassionate  frame with a pitch-jumping chorus, but that chorus <i>is</i> <b>""</b>Burning  pages, nothing more,/ Life will leave you, of that i'm sure.""  ""Hang  on Lucifer"" is, well, called <i>that</i>, and does contain the creepy  line ""In the light that leads to a blindness, he crept in, quietly  serene,"" but its chippy guitars and non-stop sound effects button-pushing  makes it, like ""Colour Dream"", sound like an early-century SFA demo.</p>
<p><i>Tomorrow</i> remains compelling  through ""Static Object"", the record's closest thing to a  Joy  Division moment, but then limps out over its last third, mired in a  tone/tempo bog that reveals the group's soft spots and least-appealing  features.  ""Pretty Bird"" and ""Station Sky"" pack plenty  of studio whirlygigs, but they lack either compelling hooks or a propulsive  rhythm.  ""Call the Incredible"" is Seeland's idea of a slow-building  dramatic epic, and a lyric like <b>""</b>You can be anything that you  choose, it's up to you"" indicates how much the whole bit feels like  a phone-in.  They started the LP by showing  a refreshing knack  for cranking out effortlessly catchy patch-cord pop, then end it by  falling victim to the preset function.  In terms of prolificacy, their  definitions of ""tomorrow"" and ""today"" seem to only loosely resemble  my own, but if they want to take less than five years to record a followup,  I'd be more than happy to see LP two lean more toward the earlier  part of this record than the later.</p></div>"|12900.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12900-tomorrow-today/|6.5|Eric Harvey

They seem immune. For more than a decade, the Los Angeles five-piece has maneuvered between cries and whispers, dirt and polish, bruising noise and narcotic subtlety, repeatedly redrawing the borders of the one genre that accommodates them, metal, as they annex more sonic territory beyond it. This means trading metal's usual symphony of downtuned riffs for a broader set of digressions and moods: On new album <i>Wavering Radiant</i>, these self-professed Fennesz and Pink Floyd devotees have turned often-drab contemporary guitar rock into music flush with fresh emotions and ideas-- a triumph that owes to the casual restraint of Joe Barresi's production. Moving away from the analytic approach favored by longtime Isis producer Matt Bayles, collecting the entire band in one place, and writing without a deadline has lent <i>Radiant</i> a sense of completeness and unity that recalls album-rock's golden years.</p>
<p><i>Wavering Radiant</i> continues the shifts made on 2006's <i>In the Absence of Truth-- </i>namely,<i> </i>more elaborate sonics and increased rhythmic variety-- while also emphasizing the finer points of tempo and, especially, melody. Melodicism not only adds a new dimension to Isis' music but another way to raise the tension, by silhouetting those melodies against their slabs of dissonance. As singer Aaron Turner told MTV, the potent, parallel forms of their past work-- one instrument tailing the other-- gave way in <i>Absence</i> to a flowing conversation of instruments. The effect there, and more so here, is a veto on thickness for the sake of thickness: The mix instead is stacked with accents and pairings that surprise and complement one another rather than feel redundant.</p>
<p>Equally vital to the record's dense, hypnotic shape is Clifford Meyer's command of the keyboard. Lingering organ lines seep into the pores and cracks of each track, leaving tiers of texture that brighten up the dark spots. For the most part, Meyer is more active than that though: His blissful, knotty phrases, played on a dusty Hammond B3 or Rhodes, often recreate moments from the psychedelic and prog-rock past. Along the same lines, the title track and the effects-laden finale ""Threshold of Transformation"" capture this feeling of retro reverie. Whether it is this brand of low-key ambience or the rhythm section's siege attack, these songs are spread across the entire dynamic range, starting with an enveloping, ruthlessly direct low end.</p>
<p>That solidity comes at the start: ""Hall of the Dead"" may be the lushest, most astutely crafted opener in the Isis discography. Fans of their earlier work will welcome the jerky first riff, but soon the grind of <i>Celestial</i> (2001) or the <i>Mosquito Control</i> EP (1998) fades away, leaving the track bobbing in sludge. Harris doesn't take it lying down, drawing menace and beauty in equal parts from his kit. Turner works similar wonders-- his clearer-than-ever voice stands out at times over the murky compositions while blending into the loud, surrounding dark at others. Not that you can understand everything he says. On the first track, the pattern of bellows and roars calls to mind Nancy and Lee's ""Some Velvet Morning"", except Turner makes it a one-man duet. The brawny thump of ""Stone to Wake a Serpent"" has him belting in both his clean and hoarse styles, too, and though the words are unintelligible, the multiple personalities of his voice nicely mirror the guitar's many incarnations on that track-- crunchy explosions of fuzz, depressed twangs, banshee shrieks.</p>
<p>Track for track, <i>Wavering Radiant</i> is the smartest and richest record in Isis' catalog: Here they manage not just to build on, but also to inventively weld together, their past work into one interlocking whole. Naysayers who cast off<i> In the Absence of Truth</i> as too subdued ought to don their headphones again: There was a sense of fastidious craft and atmosphere that may take repeated spins to sink in. And the same goes for the far superior <i>Wavering Radiant</i>. Easily the band's most accessible effort, hipsters and headbangers will likely agree it's also their most intricately imagined. To luxuriate in the details, to fully receive the melodies and tones and the bewildering interplay of every element, Isis demand not merely active, not athletic, but something like Olympic listening.</p></div>"|13009.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13009-wavering-radiant/|8.5|Roque Strew

In retrospect, <i>Silent Alarm </i> was unusually well-positioned for this sort of treatment: Though energetic  and brash and packed with ideas, the production was spacious enough  to leave something to the imagination.  And though seduced by dance  music's textures and form, Bloc Party needed someone to <i>take it  there</i> while they fretted about serious shit like gas prices and  manifest destiny.  It also didn't hurt that the original was a hell of  a record to begin with.</p>
<p>All this goes a long way towards  explaining how <i>Intimacy </i>is the Bloc Party record most indebted  to electronic composition and yet the worst suited for a full-length  remix.  In its original form, <i>Intimacy </i> already sounded like a remix of a rock record, overstuffed and pimped  out exhibits of Paul Epworth and Jacknife Lee's studio trickery.   The best and possibly only way to hear these songs differently would  be to be strip them down to the chassis: Even if you were into ""Ares""  and ""Mercury"", did you think, ""Hey, you know what these songs  could use?  <i>More </i>block rockin' beats and star guitars!""?   Kele Okereke's vocal performances on each were goofy enough to be  hooky, but <i>Intimacy Remixed </i> starts out with two variations on the same blow-snorting bassline and  candy raver thump that will remind you that as long as it's been since  you listened to Justice's <i>†</i>, it's been even longer since you've  seen <i>Go. </i></p>
<p>Truth is that for all the hoping-for-a-miracle  stridency of <i>Silent Alarm</i>, Bloc Party have always been a band  that's way more sappy than their reputation sometimes allows.   But that could've been used to their advantage here, since many of  the electronic acts that have crossed over to rockist ears have not  only dealt in softer, more cerebral sounds, but also more minimal ones.   I don't know if Air France could salvage ""Zephyrus"" or whether  ""Mercury"" could be chopped and looped Field-style or if ""Halo""  could make for solid dubstep or if <i>Intimacy </i> could possibly go Balearic.  But doesn't that already sound like  a more interesting angle?  ""Signs"" was basically <i>Intimacy'</i>s  answer to ""So Here We Are"", very gorgeous on its own, but still  leaving airspace to float upwards to-- I'd certainly like to hear what  Four Tet could do with it, because even if Armand Van Helden's hyper-compressed  swells are at least an original take, it still ruins the mood completely.   ""Ion Square"" ended the original iTunes release of <i>Intimacy </i> on a note of gorgeous hope, while the Banjo or Freakout remix offers  neither, and instead Okereke's vocal falls further and further down  an aluminum well.</p>
<p>It's hard to tell who's  really at fault here, Bloc Party or their charges.  But remix albums  all but acknowledge their own inessentiality-- why not take more chances  when only the diehards are going to subject themselves to 60 minutes  of someone else's idea of what <i>Intimacy </i> could sound like?  What if Mogwai showed up with more than just  an extra flanger effect? And then No Age of all people show up to tinker  with ""Better Than Heaven"", one of <i>Intimacy</i>'s<i> </i> Side-B highlights.  You might want to sit down for this, but after  a smear of backmasked vocals, it soon becomes a hotly recorded mess  of distorted drumming and feedback.  Granted, that's old hat  for No Age, but the idea of Bloc Party being inspired by their racket  is the sort of ""who knew?"" surprise that a no-expectation affair  like this should offer.</p>
<p>And yet, even with <i>Intimacy  Remixed</i>'s almost non-existent replay value, it actually offers  something of a sense of hope.  I sometimes wonder if I was too  tough on <i>Intimacy</i>, because even if the songs themselves failed,  there was at least the indication that Bloc Party was still trying to  offer something <i>bigger </i>than even their peers from 2003-2005;  Maxïmo Park and Futureheads march sluggishly ever onward to anonymity,  while Franz Ferdinand have become so competent that I have to remind  myself they actually released a record just this year.  I realize  that there's plenty of bands that want to sound like ""Helicopter"", and Bloc Party is no longer one of them-- but <i>Remixed </i> proves that they might want to think different instead of simply thinking  bigger.</p></div>"|13020.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13020-intimacy-remixed/|3.2|Ian Cohen

Other folks listen for comfort music-- old sounds given a new sheen or a new industry push. These divisions aren't always obvious, as champions of all genres and members of every social group fall unevenly and unpredictably into (and between) those dual castes. You'll find respective purists in noise and adult-contemporary pop, and you'll find teenagers and their grandparents who pine for the good ol' days. Each is bound to have a more progressive counterpart somewhere on the other side of the fence.</p>
<p>Don't be surprised, then,  that one of the most ambitious and iconoclastic rock records of the  year comes from three bearded, farm-living brothers raised in the rural  hills between Washington, D.C., and Virginia's Shenandoah Mountains.  Together as Pontiak, the Carneys-- Jennings, Lain, and Van-- turn <i>Maker</i>,  their second album for Thrill Jockey, into a platform for bending elemental  rock'n'roll into warped shapes. All the while, they keep  the purists happy by putting the song at the center of the conquest.</p>
<p>Pontiak self-released their second  record, <i>Sun on Sun</i>, in 2007 in an edition of 500 LPs. Last year,  Thrill Jockey grabbed the album for a wide reissue that went largely  unnoticed. Makes sense: <i>Sun on Sun</i> remains a somewhat  indefinable quantity that erects big, brash rock songs with three-part  harmonies and clangorous playing amid extended instrumental interludes,  outros, and intros. United only by a slight haze of mystery and a visceral  first-take buzz, the brothers mined slight funk (""White Mice""),  bar-band force (""Shell Skull""), roadhouse waltzes (""Tell Me About""),  and dreamy gospel-rock (""Sun on Sun"") in nine weird numbers. The  songs themselves were strong, but it's easy to see how the record-- blurring  borders as it did-- could be written off as non-committal heavy rock.</p>
<p>It was easy to imagine Pontiak  trimming the fat for the follow-up, editing away the instrumental excess  and focusing on rock songs that could land on blogs and college charts.  That might happen yet: The <i>Maker</i> tracks with relatively traditional  structures are outstanding pan-American rock songs, aggregating blues,  soul, Southern rock, and alt-rock into tunes you can, you know, sing.  Opener ""Laywayed"" introduces its layers one at a time-- a jagged  guitar line, a simple drum march, big bass sustains-- before charging  into two parallel verses built so well that they're as memorable as  a refrain (which the song forgoes). Above grimy guitar and bass, the  Carneys present ""Honey"" in three-piece vocal unison, turning what  sounds like a work song on its head. Pontiak grind through a series  of bucolic images with resolute lethargy, suggesting a springtime Sunday  where chores are abandoned for play-- booze, instruments, naps.</p>
<p>Overall, though, <i>Maker </i> is perhaps twice as divisive as its predecessor. With two more tracks  and seven more minutes, it's increasingly eclectic and rangy. Still,  it's more cohesive than <i>Sun on Sun</i> because its lopsided structure  engenders a sense of propulsion. Each time a pattern begins to emerge,  the Carneys destroy it: During ""Laywayed"", for instance, Pontiak  ride a riff for the first 30 seconds. They pause, but instead of immediately  ripping back into the song, they go silent for five seconds. The bait-and-switch  commands attention.</p>
<p>And there's the album's  overall structure: The first, third, and fifth tracks are lumbering rock  anthems worth humming. The subsequent even-numbered tracks-- two, four,  and six-- are aggressive instrumental bursts, each lasting less than  two minutes. After track seven's subdued sing-along, you'd expect  a return to those two-minute offensives. Instead, Pontiak unveil their  instrumental epic, the 14-minute title track that builds and collapses  several times over its length. Mining Om's bass-and-cymbal throb,  ""Maker"" wallows at a mid-tempo trot. Little melodies swirl, and the  tune gradually builds to the eight-minute mark. Then the pot begins  to boil. Pontiak roar, but they settle again, their careful tension  and release drawing more attention to riffs and rhythms than catharsis.  Even at 14 minutes, ""Maker"" develops, moves, and feels like a song,  not a long edit of a jam or exercise.</p>
<p>And that's the real charm  of <i>Maker</i>. Even when Pontiak are demolishing, abbreviating, or stretching  structures, they maintain an allegiance to song. ""Heat Pleasure""  might be 94 seconds of cymbal splatter and feedback rolling into one  wide wave, but it adheres with direction and purpose. With its shifts  in meter and simple key changes, the headlong burst ""Headless Conference""  is as memorable as ""Wild Knife Night Fight"", the catchy harmony-heavy  bass tune that follows. Even the album's ragtag acoustic number sounds  as subversive as the 14-minute trip in front of it. Pontiak, then, find  ways to satisfy both castes-- the musical purists and progressives-- even  as they play songs that seem designed for one or the other.</p></div>"|12977.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12977-maker/|7.9|Grayson Currin

He said it doesn't, explaining, ""One of the most important things about any sort of art is an element of humor, and not to take yourself too seriously."" Same goes for art <i>appreciation</i>, not that you'd know it most days from us stuffy critics.</p>
<p>Let Marty McFly tell you: The future is heavy. U.S. producer Machine, probably best known for his work with metal musos Lamb of God, has been getting fine work out of bands that make melodic indie rock similar to LC!'s, only... less twee. First up was Birmingham, England's Johnny Foreigner, whose excellent 2008 <i>Waited Up 'Til It Was Light</i> had macho muscle to match its endearing boy-girl singalongs. Now Glaswegian sextet Dananananaykroyd, also under Machine's oversight, follow with another debut liable to unite moshers and librarians. The two aren't mutually exclusive, you know.</p>
<p>On <i>Hey Everyone!</i>, Dananananaykroyd's chopsy dual-drummer approach goes for wrecking-ball guitar leads before fatal LiveJournal entries; your standard, spindly UK indie always meets with something heavier. On ""The Greater Than Symbol and the Dash"", guitarists Duncan Robertson and David Roy dive from piercing feedback to downers-dosed metal lurch; a pair of cascading drum fills make way for a throat-curdler from the singer (Calum Gunn and co-drummer John Baille Junior share lead duties), who sounds raw and bestial where his peers might come off shrill. ""1993"" is another scream, splitting time between hardcore thrash and contemplative instrumental passages that recall the 1990s emo likes of Mineral and Sunny Day Real Estate. Throughout, Dananananaykroyd fuck with time signatures the way indie-famouser Glaswegians play with words.</p>
<p>Um, then again, there's really no ignoring that ridiculous band name. Which I'm starting to think is as brilliant as I originally thought it was dumb-- another set of not-really-opposites. On the same song, Dananananaykroyd (thanks, Command-V! And thank <i>you</i>, Elwood Blues!) make a defiant mantra out of a decidedly twee-ass phrase: ""Turn your hissy fits into sissy hits."" Good advice, that, and it works multiple could-be-hit wonders. With its jagged surge and shouts of ""say it!"", ""Pink Sabbath"" is less Ozzy, more Mclusky. ""Black Wax"" makes room in its beautiful-and-stoned Pavement jangle for dramatic backing vocals and agonized yells; the galloping rhythms and rapidfire guitar hooks of first self-effacing ""Totally Bone"" and then Beatles-citing finale ""Song One Puzzle"" had me thinking Modest Mouse until they had me thinking, almost, Mastodon. Sissy hit: anti-pep-rally shoutalongs.</p>
<p>For as awesome as Dananananaykroyd are at blasting the bejesus out of some of my favorite bands-- hey, they can even play their instruments!-- it's less clear what they're all about. <i>Hey Everyone!</i> doesn't wear its heart on its sleeve like sloppier Mclusky-ites Japandroids, doesn't reflect every nuance of its scene with the observational acuity of LC!, isn't <i>Mclusky Do Dallas</i>. But in its own combustive way, it's weirdly memorable. The track that initially drew me in, ""Infinity Milk"", uses ragged sprawl to set off call-and-response vocals about napalm. ""These are the days of our fucking lives,"" exults ""Hey James"". We used to dream; now we've learned to stop worrying and love the firebomb.</p></div>"|12964.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12964-hey-everyone/|7.4|Marc Hogan

For example, think of how most anyone that has ever owned a copy of the Magnetic Fields' <i>69 Love Songs</i> has narrowed it down to a single disc of favorites, and how all of those customized mixes seem to differ from each other significantly. When albums include a large number of songs in a variety of styles, it's nearly inevitable that they seem uneven and test the patience of even the most generous fan. This is very much the case with Casper &amp; the Cookies' third album, <i>Modern Silence</i>, which burns through 18 tracks in nearly 70 minutes, and invites serious listener fatigue despite the band's gift for writing songs with pleasant melodies and occasionally interesting textures.</p>
<p><i>Modern Silence</i> starts strong with a handful of assured, well-constructed pop songs that establish the band's eclecticism and set a high bar for the rest of the album. After kicking off with the breezy glam rocker ""Little King"" and the casually groovy ""You Love Me"", the group veers off in a less accessible but more intriguing direction with ""Pete Erchick Bicentennial Service Area"", a peculiar, twitchy number that nods to a dozen strains of post-punk before ending on an inexplicable electric piano outro that sounds rather like ""lite jazz"" hold music. This is the band at their best-- leaning hard on familiar styles and sounds, but tweaking them with unexpected tones and tangents. ""Sharp!"", the next cut, applies a similarly eccentric trajectory to a funky, hyperactive tune that recalls some of the songs on of Montreal's <i>The Sunlandic Twins</i>, but after its abrupt conclusion, the record immediately hits a wall with the clunky, treacly ballad ""Song Across The Sea"". This is an unfortunate bit of sequencing, not simply for the way it kills the album's momentum, but in that it signals the record's uneven nature a bit too soon.</p>
<p>After this point, <i>Modern Silence</i> loses any sense of cohesion and begins to seem more like an arbitrarily sequenced playlist than an album. In the long middle phase of the record, the group offers diminishing returns on song forms already established in its first third. ""Moldy Flower"" is an amiable riff rocker, but lacks the easy charm of ""Little King"". ""Cloud of Bees"", though weirder and more melodically appealing than ""Song Across the Sea"", is no less of a mood-killer. The colorful, goofy jerkiness of ""Sharp!"" is echoed in ""Little Lady Larva"", but with the cloying wackiness of a second-rate children's song. This stretch is not a total drag, however. ""Meredith"", a track penned by songwriter Kay Stanton, comes off like a great lost 80s college-rock hit with a lead vocal falling somewhere between the deliveries of Barbara Manning and Kristen Hersh. Stanton also shines on the perky quasi-gospel number ""Sunshine Girl"".</p>
<p>Given that the greatest flaw of <i>Modern Silence</i> is its overlong duration, it's something of a surprise that the 15-minute epic that ends the record ranks among its best selections. ""I Am Gone"", a trippy audio collage encompassing elements of psychedelia, jazz, electronic pop, and all manner of madcap silliness, features 35 musicians, but no members of Casper &amp; the Cookies. The composition is wildly indulgent but consistently engaging, moving from idea to idea with an enthusiasm and imagination lacking in too many of the tracks that precede it. When the group is more straightforward, their mild-mannered demeanor and competent professionalism come as a detriment to the songs, which take on the hollow catchiness of a mediocre musical theater approximation of rock music.

Sure, their creative zest has also buckled under the pressure of success and pristine production, but of all the ""angular"" sediment the Franz Ferdinand tidal wave brought with it, the always underrated Maxïmo Park felt most like a diamond in the rough. Debut <i>A Certain Trigger</i> still staves off easy pigeonholing, its influences obvious but execution nuanced. Also, for a thorough album that didn't need to rely on singles, it gave us fist-pumpers like ""Apply Some Pressure"" and ""Graffiti"", instantly classic guitar-rock songs at a time when the previously redundant phrase ""guitar rock"" became a niche modifier. Yes, the other revivalists had big hits and nifty debut albums, too, but Maxïmo Park felt unique, more wide-eyed and versatile and, most importantly, not too tightly tethered to any one trend.</p>
<p>So why are Maxïmo Park milling around the same mid-career cul-de-sac as their cohorts? For starters, they over-reached to prove their songwriting chops on 2007's coercively grown-up <i>Our Earthly Pleasures</i>. Like Keanu Reeves on that bus, the band's hooks are doomed when traveling at less-than-frenetic speeds, and <i>Pleasures</i> was too concerned with deliberately collating all the emotions and anxieties that sounded better strewn about on the debut. Not-so-secret weapon Paul Smith, a throwback to show-stealing Brit frontmen like Morrissey and Jarvis Cocker, felt wasted on that album, relegated to ham-fisted attempts at conventional balladry and Beatles-esque melodies instead of his signature half-ranted, half-sung vocals.</p>
<p><i>Quicken</i> <i>the Heart</i>'s title is telling. The band seems to know their need to jumpstart the schmaltz from <i>Pleasures</i> and recapture the dilettantish energy that made <i>Trigger</i> so likable and unintentionally chic. Easier said than done, though. With Nick Launay behind the boards, the album feels like a geeky brother to <i>It's Blitz!</i>, also produced by Launay. The pairing bears fruit on ""The Kids Are Sick Again"", a mid-tempo single that begins with the same warm electro-rock buzz of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' ""Zero"" or ""Soft Shock"" then escalates to a chorus worthy of Pulp during their peak. However, most of the synth lines here sound like they've wondered onto tracks they have no place occupying. The sluggish guitar rock on ""In Another World (You Would've Found Yourself by Now)"" and ""Calm"" needs more raw space and jagged guitar parts, not a coating of cold synthesizers to undermine Smith's heart-on-sleeve immediacy.</p>
<p>Unlike Norton's adult-contemporary treatment on <i>Pleasures</i>, though, Launay helps the album more than he hurts it. The fact is, these are the weakest batch of songs Maxïmo Park's brought into the studio to date. On attempted throwbacks like ""The Penultimate Clinch"", Smith and his bandmates struggle to regain their charisma, the song's limp kraut groove not helped by bathos like ""...But it's like dismantling/ A decommissioned spacecraft/ Some parts you can't destroy."" Even when showing their cards on ""Let's Get Clinical"" and ""Tanned"", two jerky math jams humbly cribbed from Wire's <i>154</i>, the result feels tackier than it does sophisticated.</p>
<p><i>Pleasures</i> at least hit the soft targets it set out to. Here, the band's grasping at a sense of cool they used to stumble upon almost by accident. By the gooey last few tracks of <i>Quicken</i>, it seems they've quit the search for a fountain of youth, not even leaving a kernel of hope like <i>Pleasures</i> closer ""Parisian Skies"", which hinted at Maxïmo Park becoming a 21st century version of R.E.M. Still, this album isn't a death knell for these once beloved upstarts. Smith is still persistently moral and compassionate, trying to preserve his heart (and sanity) in a fast-paced world of hi-tech gadgets and long-distance relationships. And perhaps part of the problem is that Maxïmo Park's hearts are too big. The painstaking introspection here seems to stem from a need to use their success and exposure to deliver some definitive, U2-sized message when really they're so much more relatable when they're awkwardly sorting out their psychological messes on the fly.</p></div>"|13007.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13007-quicken-the-heart/|5.5|Adam Moerder

Having started out as the solo project of former Neutral Milk Hotel drummer and multi-instrumentalist Jeremy Barnes, AHAAH's extraordinarily beautiful self-titled debut album was recorded in the French countryside and released in 2002. Later travels in the Czech Republic inspired another recording before Barnes returned to his hometown of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he met his paramour and collaborator, the highly talented violinist Heather Trost. A likeminded passion for music and adventure led the couple to spend extended periods of time in Hungry and Romania as they forged deep bonds with local musicians, capturing the magic of their interaction on an EP, 2007's <i>A Hawk and A Hacksaw and the Hun Hangár Ensemble</i>.</p>
<p>A Hawk and a Hacksaw's music has always been heavily inspired by the folk traditions of Eastern Europe, and their determination to integrate themselves into that region's culture and contemporary music scene has enabled them to continuously create absorbing and exciting songs. Since the duo are actively learning about the music they love from the artists who know it best, AHAAH's compositions always sound like they're moving forward and flourishing-- whereas a less musically courageous group could end up being a one trick pony. Their fourth album, <i>Délivrance</i>, is centered around Barnes' masterful tackling of percussion and accordion, Trost on violin, and a gaggle of Hungarian specialists such as the trumpeter Ferenc Kovács and one of the world's foremost cimbalom virtuosos, Kálmán Balogh, who bring their animated musical personalities into the frame.</p>
<p>On past albums, AHAAH's klezmer and folk motifs have been anchored by a certain sorrow that was evident amid the exuberance, enticing the listener to experience a varied emotional flow. <i>Délivrance</i> is no less potent for being as effervescently high-spirited as it is. Even the lackadaisical drama of ""Vasalisa Carries a Flaming Skull Through the Forest"" feels drunkenly merry, like a casual, winding stroll through the trees after a night carousing on the cobblestones. If AHAAH were to have a ""party"" album, this would be it. Tracks such as ""The Man Who Sold His Beard"" and ""Zibiciu"" are foot-stomping reveries that sound as though they were composed in a smoky, crowded café on the banks of the Danube. So it's not surprising to hear that the band often kick started their improvisations with a shot of pálinka, a type of Hungarian fruit brandy.</p>
<p>As the group continues to draw inspiration from their travels and friends, they challenge themselves with baffling rhythmic tricks and collaborative ideas that fuse traditional melodies with their own distinguishing attributes. The gloriously sprightly energy of <i>Délivrance</i> is so ebullient and full of character that by the time it's over you feel like you've caught a glimpse of the type of joyful festivity that always feels most rewarding after a long journey.</p></div>"|12997.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12997-delivrance/|7.8|Mia Clarke

If you start from the front of the record, then Marc Masters' description of their sound (in <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11147-bronzage/"" target=""_blank"">his write-up</a> of the album's excellent lead-off track, ""Bronzage"") is the way to go-- ""think hyper math-punk with touches of prog and hardcore."" If you're listening to this on shuffle, and you happen to land on ""Birdtown"", you might think you've stumbled across an uninspired horn-loving synth-heavy instrumental combo. If the wild oscillations and rumbling hiss of ""Lismer"" tumble from your earbuds, you'll think these guys are spastic obnoxious noiseniks. The NES mating calls in ""I'm Still in the Wall"" (along with an earlier album's title-- <i>Blue Screen of Death</i>) might have you believe DD/MM/YYYY are card-carrying members of Bitpop Nation.</p>
<p>In other words, <i>Black Square</i> covers a fair amount of territory over the course of 35 minutes. For better or worse, DD/MM/YYYY don't stay in one place for long, and they certainly don't keep still.  As the bookends of this album ably display-- ""Bronzage"" at the start, ""Digital Haircuit"" at the end-- DD/MM/YYYY can rein in their stylistic happy feet long enough to bang out infectious and spry post-punky tunes.  Most of the album features a fair number of similar songs that effectively encompass DD/MM/YYYY's disparate musical interests without seeming fussy or overwrought. Unfortunately, they try to mimic their stop-start rhythmic agility with the album's various stylistic shifts.  It's not so much that the changes of pace are unwelcome, but it's the way these changes are implemented that causes problems.</p>
<p>The whip-smart call-and-response action in ""No Life""-- think Fugazi with pocket-protectors-- is abruptly cut off at the two-minute mark, careening listeners headfirst into the queasy shimmering torpor of ""'They'"" and a potential case of whiplash. Detours like ""My Glasses""-- a minute-long track of someone running their finger along the edge of vinegar-rimmed drinking glasses-- or the aforementioned ""Birdtown"" wouldn't be so bad if they weren't put back-to-back right in the middle of the album. These  bait-and-switch tactics do a lot to stall the album's momentum. In the case of the brake-slamming tempo change in ""Real Eyes"", it can gum up the works mid-song. And then there's an arcade-game-sampling instrumental to contend with before <i>Black Square</i> gets back to doing what it did back at the start. For folks willing to roll with the punches, or fans of the Mae Shi and friends looking for more of the same type of hyper-hopscotch, <i>Black Square</i> will be a highly enjoyable front-to-back listen.  But for folks expecting  more versions of what its first few tunes promise, the sardonic words of advice offered in the intro to ""$50,000 Guitar Head"" suffice as a fair warning: ""Good luck-- you'll need it!""</p></div>"|13017.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13017-black-square/|6.6|David Raposa

And there, apparently, you would have been wrong: the Toronto metal-gaze duo Nadja proves it on the first seconds of their audacious and spectacular new covers record <i>When I See the Sun Always Shines On TV</i>. Their version slows the tempo so drastically that the song feels like it might derail; listening to it feels like watching a drunk friend stagger to their front door and praying they don't trip on their dragging feet. The guitar fuzz is wince-inducingly harsh, as if Aidan Baker gave his amp the Dave Davies treatment: i.e., two slashes straight right through the head. The vocals, while still buried, emanate low and warped from the bottom of the mix instead of floating weightlessly above it. If you could chop and screw a shoegaze record (screw-gaze?) it might sound like this, and Nadja's roaring wind-tunnel version manages to render MBV's original airy and harmless by comparison, as blasphemous as that might sound.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 12px;"">For an ambient metal act, <i>Loveless</i> is basically Everest, and for Nadja to tackle one of its signature songs and flawlessly stick the landing for the <i>opening</i> track of their record gives just a hint of <i>When I See the Sun</i>'s ambition and reach. Of all the droning metal-gaze groups-- Isis, Caïna, Katatonia-- Nadja have the best grasp on massive distortion's ability to alternately bludgeon and soothe, and the overwhelming wall of body-vibrating noise they summon on record is a profoundly physical, even sensual experience. When you produce a sound this enormous, it begins to live a life apart from you, and Nadja have spent their career taming and harnessing the beast they have created. Their previous records were mostly exercises in sound worship, the sort of amniotic sound tanks you immerse yourself in with a pair of boutique headphones when you want your mind obliterated. But on<i> When I See the Sun</i>, they seem to want to prove they also recognize great songwriting, and it turns out they not only have impeccable taste, they also have an instinctive understanding of the type of songs that tend to increase in mystery and intimacy when swaddled in an impenetrable fog of guitars.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 12px;"">Some of their choices are intuitive, even obvious-- the cover of ""Pea"", for instance, from Codeine's 1990 slowcore classic <i>Frigid Stars, </i>feels even more numbed and despondent than the original, which was one of the more emotionally naked, vulnerable moments on the album. Swans' ""No Cure For the Lonely"", from 1992's <i>Love of Life</i>,<i> </i>is another logical selection, and Nadja hit every step in the song's endlessly descending chord progression with a bleary thud. Their rendition of the Cure's ""Faith"", meanwhile, is one of the only moments where their reach slightly exceeds their grasp; Baker's murmuring, chant-beneath-the-waves vocals don't quite fit a song that laid so much at the feet of its miraculous vocal performance. It's impossible to hear the contours of the song's melody being traced and not immediately yearn for Robert Smith's pure, keening tenor.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0px 0px 12px;"">The album's most revelatory moment, in the end, results from one of the most left-field choices: the astonishing cover of Elliott Smith's ""Needle in the Hay"". Baker and Leah Buckareff's battering ram of noise transforms the original's crystalline fragility into one long, slow, sickening dive downward. Baker's already buried vocals are abstracted to a ghostly, disembodied wisp, which perfectly suits the under-the-breath quality of Smith's angry mantras. Lester Bangs often observed that heavy metal's womblike bass frequencies provided handy sanctuary for the numbed and depressed; <span>Nadja must have recognized in Smith someone who would welcome the comfort that an immersion in pure noise could bring.</span></p></div>"|13026.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13026-when-i-see-the-sun-always-shines-on-tv/|8.0|Jayson Greene

Like the ship in a jar that decorates the album cover, <i>Paradise</i> was a fantastical world in miniature, intricately detailed and designed to evoke imaginative flights of fancy. It was also <i>too</i> ethereal: all flying and no destination. A year and a half later, Watson is back with his third album, <i>Wooden Arms</i>, and not much has changed. He's still waiting to sweep us from our bedroom windows and show us a wonderful world that exists in the realm of the fantastic, his voice is still cartoonishly woozy and antique-sounding (part Jeff Buckley, but also M. Ward and Devendra Banhart), and his music still sounds like an ultra-busy score for a highbrow children's book or a whimsical silent film. And the same vexing problem keeps arising: When the band isn't making music that operates under a frustrating dream logic, they're, well, lulling me to sleep.</p>
<p><i>Wooden</i> even features a song called ""Where the Wild Things Are"", which should surprise no one. Watson, still inextricable from the liminal state between dreaming and waking life, wrote the piece as an homage to his favorite book as a child, with the knowledge that Spike Jonze was adapting the book for an upcoming film. The song's light, apprehensive piano and foreboding pizzicato strings do have the feel of a score (Watson actually sent it to Jonze on a lark). Too bad it's meant to stand on its own on <i>Wooden</i>, because it doesn't do much without a proper cinematic referent. Watson's simplistic, light-headed incantations-- ""I go to where the wild things are""-- aren't exactly transfixing, and the arrangement as a whole bogs down in pre-bedtime sleepiness on its way to dreamland.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <i>Wooden</i> marks an ever-so-slight shift in approach. Specifically, the album's classicist leanings are cut with a more ""organic"" vibe, which too often emerges sounding like a group of classically-trained buskers than what they seemed to be aiming toward: Elvis Perkins, or maybe Grizzly Bear. ""Beijing"" promises to deliver ""the sound of the city"" (or so Watson's hazy refrain would have us believe), but the song's lasting image is its percussion, a hyperactive hodgepodge of clanking metals that does no favors to the competing mellow tone of the piece. The same goes for the preceding number ""Tracy's Waters"", which buries a simple melody under layers of floor toms, tinkling doodads, and sappy strings. ""Down at the Beach"" is downright frustrating in its lack of structure or motivation, moving from nervous strings to a wholly unearned post-rock style mid-song crescendo, and ending with a brooding piano atop more far-off clickety-clack. I've no idea how the band creates its music, but I have the suspicion that if I hired Patrick Watson (again, the name of the collective <i>and</i> its leader) to build my home, I would expect to get the dining room wallpaper and front-porch trimwork plans first.</p>
<p>Patrick Watson doesn't do foundation work exceedingly well. Yet this is not to say that there aren't moments on <i>Wooden</i> that suggest songcraft was the foremost urge. The title track is a sweet little lullaby (something that, despite his faults as a songwriter, Watson does pretty well) crafted mainly from a standup bassline and piano, with even the extraneous noises glossing as little pitter-pats. ""Big Bird in a Small Cage"" starts as another anxious piano piece, but detours after the first verse into a country duet, featuring Katie Moore, whose high quaver suggests a young Dolly Parton. ""Big Bird"" does have its unnecessary additions-- do we really need all those Beach Boys-ish ""ba ba ba""s?-- but at least it works from a somewhat solid melodic structure, so that breaks from it are always referencing something firm. On an album comprised of so many left turns, it's one of the few unexpected moments that registers as a <i>welcome</i> surprise.</p></div>"|13027.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13027-wooden-arms/|3.3|Eric Harvey

Black &amp;  white, sepia, a hint of red or blue-- the visual aesthetic of his records  has been remarkably consistent. The easy joke here is that it's only  been as consistent as the tone of his music-- slow and melancholy, with  almost no exceptions-- but for a guy who really only has one speed,  Kozelek has a very rewarding (and very deep) discography. <i>Lost Verses Live</i> is a long album gathering recordings from shows played  in Philadelphia, Brooklyn, and San Francisco, alone with his guitar, and sometimes  joined by second acoustic guitarist (and former Red House Painter) Phil  Carney.</p>
<p>It's very similar in feel to  last year's comparably sparse live mini-album <i>7 Songs Belfast</i>,  and its basic sonic uniformity and beauty means it plays almost like  an ambient recording. You can put it on in the background as well as  any Eno meditation, but as with any great ambient music it also holds  up to closer listening. Dictionary.com could save some time by simply  uploading a sample of Kozelek singing to serve as its definition for  melancholy, and his milky baritone rings out with intense clarity on  these recordings, which were made in resonant rooms, from churches to  theaters. Devoted fans will be richly rewarded for picking this up,  though some newcomers might find their ears wandering as it stretches  past the hour mark.</p>
<p>I was split on whether I wanted  the ""Lucky Man"" in the tracklisting to be a version of his own song  by that name or an Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer cover, but having heard  the crystalline reading of his own song, I'm glad it wasn't yet another  novel cover from a guy who loves to give the solo acoustic treatment  to KISS, AC/DC, and Modest Mouse. Modest Mouse's ""Tiny Cities Made  of Ashes"" does get the plaintive, quiet treatment here, one of two  covers along with Sondheim's ""Send in the Clowns"", which Kozelek  makes about as heartbreaking as possible. He turns in a haunting, spare  version of Sun Kil Moon's ""Salvador Sanchez"", a song about a now-deceased  featherweight boxing champion, and in general, haunting is the best  descriptor for many of these songs. ""Tonight in Bilbao"" is simply  about traveling Europe alone, but man is Kozelek ever <i>alone</i> as  he sings about distant lights and train stations.</p>
<p>There are a few bits of stage  banter included to break up the pristine sadness, and they're all welcome.  He makes the audience laugh in most of them, joking about being hot  on stage but refusing to take his shirt off at 41 years old. When the  lilting lullaby of ""Katy Song"" comes to a sudden stop at the end  of the disc, one can't help but be a little surprised-- a record with  such a timeless feel hardly seems like it even can end, but like all  good things, it does. Kozelek is a powerful performer, and every fan  should have at least one of his live recordings. If you haven't heard  one yet, this should be the one.</p></div>"|13015.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13015-lost-verses-live/|7.0|Joe Tangari

Teacher and student moved (separately) to Nashville, where  they attended guitar pulls with the likes of Guy Clark and Steve Young.  With his bone-deep intuition of country's potential for clearly and  unpretentiously expressing emotional pain, Van Zandt, who died in 1997,  taught Earle well, and you can hear the elder's influences in later  compositions songs ""Goodbye"", ""Mercenary Song"", and ""Everyone's  in Love with You"". In turn, Earle has lionized Van Zandt, naming him  a patron saint of barrooms and benders and even naming his first-born  Justin Townes.</p>
<p>So a full album of Van Zandt covers  was inevitable-- the culmination of Earle's three-and-a-half-decade  admiration. In fact, it's surprising that <i>Townes</i>, as the album  is titled, didn't arrive sooner. The concept may be genuine, but the  timing seems calculated: For most of the Bush administration, Earle's  career has been in a doldrums, and his last album, <i>Washington Square  Serenade</i>, was quite possibly his worst. What should have been his  ace, however, is not even a face card. <i>Townes</i> might have been  inevitable, but it didn't have to be so dull.</p>
<p>Earle keeps things fairly simple, performing  stripped-down arrangements with a small group of musicians who function  less as a backing band and more as a bunch of friends drinking beer  on the front porch. For the most part, it's just Earle alone with  these songs, his gravel voice matched to Van Zandt's well-worn lyrics.  This approach works well enough on ""Pancho and Lefty"", which here  becomes a headhung lament and thankfully lacks the synths of Willie  and Merle's duet. Likewise, ""Colorado Girl"" and ""Marie"" re-create  the casual intimacy of a late-night guitar pull. These are, along with  melancholy closer ""To Live Is to Fly"" and the bluegrass-stained  ""White Freight Liner Blues"", the album's brightest spots, as if  Earle were emphasizing sentiment and performative spontaneity over all  else.</p>
<p>But what's lively on some songs is  deadly on others. Earle plugs in for the bluesy ""Brand New Companion,""  although it drags ass so much you wish he'd unplug again. ""Delta  Momma Blues"" picks up where ""White Freightliner Blues"" leaves  off, but either the song just doesn't support the playing or this  take was not especially inspired. And can someone please steal Earle's  drum machine and distorto harmonica? There's something vulgar about  the way they sound on this rough treatment of ""Lungs"", which features  Tom Morello. This version trades mordant humor (""Well, won't you lend  your lungs to me?"") for apocalyptic doomsaying and turns the original's  modest blues rhythm into a cartoonish ""When the Man Comes Around"".  Earle is certainly allowed to manhandle these not-quite-canonical songs,  but in the rough and obvious way he mistreats them, he leaves little  room for subtlety, restraint, or even taste.</p>
<p>As gifted as Van Zandt was, Earle has  him on range. Throughout his career, he has played hardy rock, straightforward  country, growling blues, rambling bluegrass, and tender folk, and he  has played with the Pogues, the Blind Boys of Alabama, the Del McCoury  Band, Iris DeMent, and too many others to name. He's even published  a collection of short stories and is working on a novel. Too bad <i> Townes</i> isn't as varied. There are nods toward certain styles and  genres, but they come from the originals more often than from Earle  himself, which makes the album sound overall a little too timid. If  you're curious about Van Zandt-- and damn, you should be-- Fat Possum  reissued several out-of-print albums in 2007, and pretty much any of  those is a good place to start. If you're more interested in Earle,  give a listen to <i>Guitar Town</i> or <i>Train A Comin'</i> or  anything more than 10 years old. And if you're interested in the  two of them together, track down the recently reissued <i>Heartworn  Highways</i> collection, which features live guitar-pull performances  from the 1970s.

Metro station: Norwegian musician Hanne  Hukkelberg's arrangements are so dense and unusual they suck in sound.  Listening to the title track of her third full-length, <i>Blood from  a Stone</i>, I assumed the off-tempo clacks and the loud blasts of distortion  I was hearing were all part of the music, the gradual ascension of the  escalator heightening the song's steady crescendo. In fact, these  elements were part of the machinery; that clatter  was the grinding of escalator gears, and I'd heard that whale-song  groaning of the belts every day for years. In addition to being a good  reminder to get away from my computer more often, the experience suggested  to me a mutability in Hukkelberg's music, which can change dramatically  depending on your surroundings. To some extent, all music is like this,  but her tightly orchestrated pop can be so intricate that it becomes  interactive.</p>
<p>That sensation is further heightened  by her use of found instruments. <i>Blood From a Stone</i>, like its  two predecessors, uses everything and the kitchen sink: bicycle spokes,  typewriters, train doors, and flagpoles. Instead of drum kits, Hukkelberg  and her backing musicians fashion percussion instruments from old refrigerators,  ovens, and other discarded appliances. This isn't <i>Stomp</i>, though.  Crucially, she makes no big show of such unusual instrumentation, which  is most notable on songs like the standout ""In Here/Out There"" and  the slowly intensifying ""Crack"", when the makeshift instruments  mingle with the bass and guitar to create a strange rhythm section.  In general, these are subtle, subdued, and occasionally stiff arrangements,  which are as self-possessed as Sufjan's or Danielson's, but typically  not as ostentatious.</p>
<p>Hukkelberg would rather let all those  unfamiliar sounds affect her songs subliminally, which means <i>Blood From a Stone</i> sometimes sounds muted and detached. In fact, guitar  seems to be the prominent instrument on most of these songs: Bent notes  fly around the chorus of the title track like sparks from a campfire,  heightening the perverseness of the romantic situation she describes  in the lyrics, and an agile electric guitar line gives ""Bandy Riddles""  its insistent, almost desperate pace. Not quite as loose as her two  previous albums<i>, Blood from a Stone</i> is much more refined and  sophisticated in creating such a curious and imaginatively ambient backdrop  for her vocals and lyrics.</p>
<p>In fact, this is a singer's album,  highlighting Hukkelberg's voice above all else. Sounding at once venomously  expressive yet somewhat distant, she goes for heavy-metal drama on ""Salt  of the Earth"", contrasting a thunderous chorus with quieter verses.  Yet Hukkelberg sounds jazzily spry on the title track and surprisingly  glam on ""In Here/Out There"". Closer ""Bigd Til By"" (the only  song written in her native Norwegian) shows off her nearly prismatic  tone, evocatively accompanied by flagpole, oven, and whatever happens  to be in earshot.</p></div>"|13023.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13023-blood-from-a-stone/|7.3|Stephen M.

Matthew  Tiessen of the University of Alberta, bless him, has defined the meanderthal  as an urban monkeywrench, an inhibitor of the flow of modern life. Meanderthals (the group), presumably  not buying what Tiessen's selling, have rebranded this persona as a  loveable, harmless drifter, which aligns them philosophically with every  jam band ever and possibly Asher Roth.  Fitting, I suppose, as  the group's debut album, <i>Desire Lines</i> (the title taken from  one of Tiessen's papers), does a righteous job of staying out of pretty  much everyone's way.</p>
<p>Released on Smalltown Supersound, the  two-bit takeaway for <i>Desire Lines</i> is that it blends the peculiar  lounging of Balearic disco with folk/guitar music, peppering their  downbeat grooves with wide-screen acoustic chording and gnarled psychedelics. A purely instrumental affair, <i>Desire  Lines</i> feels roomy and unfussy despite the genre mashing, often laying  in the cut of a ponderous and swollen bassline, upon which various niceties  are poured.   The low-end is so prominent and wandering that  it sounds like the product of an old master's thumb, not a sequencer  (indeed: Malcolm Joseph, bassist for Grace Jones, is credited on the  album).</p>
<p>The bass proves an equal foil for the  widescreen, hippie-fried guitars of opener ""Kunst or Ars"", a track  so relentlessly sunny in its folktronic blend that it makes Four Tet's <i> Rounds</i> sound like Burial's <i>Untrue</i>.  Steel drums pepper  the breaks, augmenting the humid scenery. Indeed, ""Kunst or Ars"" is <i>Desire Lines</i>' most enduring moment, though for a band that doesn't shy away from  the Balearic disco tag, Meanderthals frequently dip their toes into  swampier waters. ""Lasaron Highway"" recalls Ash Ra  Tempel in both scope and oddity, noodling its way through nearly eight  minutes of highway clang. Set closer ""Bugges Room"" re-imagines lounge  jazz as a sleepy-eyed, coughing malcontent.  There's beatmaking,  too: The rummy, deep percussion that begins ""Andromeda (Prelude to  the Future)"" might've been the start to a wall-shaking banger, but  Meanderthals knead it into an un-casual, leering space-disco, the type  of song you could dance to only passively at 5 a.m.</p>
<p>""Disco"" is probably the operative  starting point for most of <i>Desire Lines</i>, but tracks often lack  the linearity and repetition that base implies.  ""Collective  Fetish"" splashes guitars against its walls, quiets to an ominous  burble, then fades to a gentle patter.  The title track pans clean  chords through each channel before building to a classic-rock climax,  complete with careening guitars whose effects all sound programmed by a 17-year-old with too many pedals, but in a neat way.</p>
<p>Barring the occasional mid-song bridge  that might have you checking your watch, most of it works, too: Even  when <i>Desire Lines</i> slows, it's because it's wandering or straggling,  not because it's hamming out same-y minutes in some ill-forged notion  of filling up a 12"" (like a <i>real</i> disco band).  This is  probably a product of all that layering, sure, but also the aforementioned  worldview; however silly, Meanderthals believe all that hokey shit.   Sometime when you're not real busy, give it a shot.</p></div>"|12996.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12996-desire-lines/|7.5|Andrew Gaerig

Whether he is fronting one of his many bands, penning provocative essays, or interviewing other musicians on his internet talk show, Svenonius is fully committed to a distinct personal aesthetic that he developed as the singer of the Nation of Ulysses that essentially boils down to a stylistic and philosophical marriage of groovy 1960s radicalism and late-80s indie-punk ethos. It's an affectation for sure, but even at his silliest extremes, it is abundantly clear that Svenonius fully believes in his rhetoric, and that it's not just some elaborate joke at the expense of old-school hipster intelligentsia. If anything, it has become clear that his performance is inherently confrontational in the way it forces cynical, complacent audiences to reckon with idealistic discontent and unapologetic goofiness, and nudges them to wonder how and why it became so uncool to mix pleasure and politics.</p>
<p>Chain and the Gang, Svenonius' latest band, does not stray far from the sound of his previous work, though it does mostly jettison the hard psychedelic style of his Weird War project. As the name of the group implies, he has integrated some elements of prison blues, but the funky playfulness of the music mostly recalls his late-90s material as the frontman of the Make-Up. This is a welcome return to form-- though Weird War had a number of great songs, too many of their recordings felt stuffy and overbearing, and Svenonius' slinky, highly expressive voice is flattered by compositions with ample negative space. The grooves on <i>Down With Liberty... Up With Chains!</i> are about as loose as a band can get without being remotely sloppy, and the result is an album that emphasizes a sense of levity that has always been present in his work, but had never been quite as dominant as in this set of songs.</p>
<p>Though Svenonius takes on some heavy topics throughout the record-- at one point, he's calling out for reparations!-- the politics of Chain and the Gang are primarily focused on matters of lifestyle and personal conduct. This is most evident on ""Trash Talk"", a rant against the omnipresence of snarkiness that owes more to the humanity and humor of Sly and the Family Stone than the clueless prissiness of anti-snark critic David Denby. It also comes through in the cheerful party rocker ""Room 19"", and in ""Unpronounceable Name"", a swinging, jazzy delight in which Svenonius plays the role of a romantic lead in pursuit of a woman with a name so difficult to say that she becomes entirely elusive and nearly mythical. Not all of the songs are gems-- the relatively dirge-like ""Deathbed Confession"" overstays its welcome by a few minutes, and the deliberately primitive ""(Lookin' For a) Cavegirl"" is rather tedious even before its first minute is through-- but otherwise the quality control is rather high, and the result may be Svenonius' best overall LP since the Make-Up's <i>Save Yourself</i> was released a decade ago.</p></div>"|13022.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13022-down-with-liberty-up-with-chains/|6.7|Matthew Perpetua

I'm admitting that up front, not as some sort of badge of lazy-ass pop critic pride, but because I've been tasked to review the latest entry in semi-sinister conglomerate/occasional patron of the arts Nike's <i>Original Run</i> series. This time it's De La Soul, using a late-career corporate sponsorship opportunity to both reaffirm their existence and provide an all-new soundtrack for a 45-minute jog.</p>
<p>So <i>caveat emptor</i> for all our fitness-minded readers: I can judge the efficacy of <i>Are You In?</i> only in contexts other than the one intended. But if you, too, are more inclined toward being, well, inclined, know that <i>Are You In?</i> is also an entertaining, intermittently unexpected, and only occasionally unflattering addition to the De La Soul catalog, more or less enjoyable whatever your attitude toward physical exertion. Despite the longest wait yet between De La full-lengths, the trio sounds agreeably engaged, approaching the project less as a formally constricted commission and more as a chance to explore what dancefloor hip-hop might mean in a post-techno world.</p>
<p>The answer seems to be old-school sonics (crashing drum machines, electro-tinged melodies, ""Rock Box""-style guitar) spruced up with 21st-century production gloss. <i>Are You In?</i> follows the readymade arc of most ""Original Run"" entries, stuffing everything into a single track that moves more like a DJ set than an album. Large sections are rap-free, letting the throwback beats steadily turn up the tempo to avoid muscle fatigue. And it opens and closes with relaxed, soul-tinged tunes for working up/wiping down a good sweat. But with a catalog full of smooth but never smarmy low-impact jams, we all know De La are masters of laid-back rap, and for a group that's outlived a few dozen hip-hop trends, ""old-school"" doesn't describe an embarrassingly nostalgic affectation so much as an expression of aesthetic continuity.</p>
<p>More surprising, if necessarily more inconsistent, are the moments when De La nearly abandon trad hip-hop entirely. While it's commendable they'd avoid simply rewriting their classic material for athletes barely out of tie-dyed onesies when <i>3 Feet High and Rising</i> dropped, there are definitely missteps. About 20 minutes in, De La drops the kind of high-speed, distorted breaks that would have padded out a pre-crossover Chemical Brothers set. Not sure about referencing ""the new style"" for a sound that peaked 13 years ago-- is it too early for the big beat revival?-- but better amyl-popping hip-house than throwing rote hard rock wank over jazz-tinged snares. Pretty much any time a guitar pops up on <i>Are You In?</i> it's mildly-to-totally cringeworthy, but I do appreciate nodding to the Delicious Vinyl days of stabbing power chords over 808s.</p>
<p>But while these heavy metal blunders do mar the album's flow-- from a listener's standpoint, if not necessarily a runner's-- they're also evidence of a gratifying restlessness on the part of an act whose audience might have been content with the same old shit. Elsewhere this creative discontent actually pays dividends for longtime fans: Who knew De La would sound so natural rapping over Detroit-ish synth arpeggios? Given its one-off status and unique format, <i>Are You In?</i> is probably a diversion rather than a reinvention, a mixtape-style curio given big business backing, but hopefully some of its reinvigorated sonics find their way to the next proper De La Soul album. Just so long as they avoid anything with six strings and a distortion pedal.</p></div>"|13016.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13016-are-you-in/|6.4|Jess Harvell

That is the question Owen Ashworth appears to be asking with his fifth full-length outing as Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, the wryly titled <i>Vs. Children</i>. But this is a Casiotone record, which means Ashworth won't provide direct access to his thoughts, relying instead on proxies, personae, and other distancing mechanisms. That is, until the record's third act, when a new Casiotone seems to emerge. Before that, however, Ashworth takes us on a joyride with a succession of mostly doomed outlaws and derelicts, with a couple of side excursions into familiar disaffected-slacker-ballad territory. It all adds up to easily the most mature and thematically ambitious Casiotone release to date, a further testament to the talents of a man more in tune with the lives of his generation than many of the folks actually living them.</p>
<p>A pair of tracks with unwieldy titles set the scene, the former an account of real-life bicycle-bound bank robber Tom Justice (an apparent one-time acquaintance of Ashworth's), and the latter a similar yarn about life on the lam, this time written in first person. The legend of Bonnie and Clyde looms large over the proceedings-- their names figure into ""Tom Justice"" and a stylized illustration of Faye Dunaway's Bonnie Parker (heavy with the child she'd never have) graces the record's cover. ""What if we'd had the kid?/ I guess it'd be 15,"" Ashworth muses on ""Natural Light"", though it could just as well be a line shared between Barrow's and Parker's ghosts during a midnight graveyard tryst. (Foreshadowing ideas that preoccupy <i>Vs. Children</i>'s second half.) That Ashworth can shift so readily between storytelling modes speaks to his considerable skill as a songwriter, one for whom allegory and autobiography are but two routes to the same shared truth.</p>
<p>But how, exactly, do we get from bank robbers to baby-making? For Ashworth, it seems that outlaws and unsettled couples are, in a sense, one and the same. Both lead lives that are fundamentally unsustainable, and both, ultimately, are on the run from reality. Yet their carefree exploits are made all the more exhilarating by the tragic inevitability of their surcease. Metaphor and reality at last come into sharp relief on <i>Vs. Children</i> as ""Northfield, MN""-- one last outlaw saga that culminates in a car crash-- is masterfully juxtaposed with ""Killers"". ""Oh my God/ What if we had an accident?/ Oh my God,"" Ashworth begins the latter song in his characteristic mumble. It would seem he's reacting to the previous song's tragedy, until you realize the ""accident"" in question here isn't a vehicular one. ""Till you're dead/ That's how long you're a parent/ Till you're dead,"" he continues, a sentiment that goes straight for the gut and leaves a baby-sized hollow feeling there.</p>
<p>Along with subsequent tracks ""Harsh the Herald Angels Sing"" and ""White Jetta"" (and excepting the backward-looking ""You Were Alone""), ""Killers"" suggests the emergence of a new Casiotone. Plenty of ""I""s  and ""me""s have found their way into past Ashworth compositions-- indeed, the early Casiotone records were full of self-caricaturizing ones-- but none sound so direct and unfettered as those heard on these songs. ""Harsh"" adopts the perspective of an unwed young woman with child, while ""Jetta"" climaxes with the dying wish of Ashworth's ill mother: for him to start a family. Both should leave even the most hardened listener a bit choked up. ""To stay the same, to never change,"" Ashworth repeatedly incants on ""Jetta"". Whether this is the futile plea of all would-be parents or meta-commentary on the Casiotone project's trajectory (like 2003's <i>Etiquette</i>, <i>Vs. Children</i> utilizes live instruments, though it's still unmistakably a ""Casiotone record"" in every formal way) doesn't matter; like truth and fiction or the personal and the public, changing and staying the same are far from mutually exclusive notions for Owen Ashworth.</p></div>"|13012.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13012-vs-children/|7.9|Matthew Solarski

Even as the indie paradigm has shifted towards the noisier, it's still  difficult to guess which (if any) of the acts in No Age's wake will  go on to find similar success. Surely due for increased attention,  though, are Smell torchbearers Mika Miko, a female five-piece  specializing in a brash (but danceable) mixture of classic late-70s  punk, hardcore thrash, and skronky no wave.</p>
<p>Known primarily for the dynamic  energy of their stage show, Mika Miko have been operating in some form  since the early part of the decade, touring shitloads and scraping together  an armful of homemade cassettes and CD-Rs. They embody Smell ideology-- community building, inclusion, steadfast DIY-ness-- and though <i> We Be Xuxa</i> is their first medium-profile release, it's actually  the group's 10th official recording. Their brand of industriousness  and good-natured punk spirit are fine reasons to like a band (or at  least root for them), but the other part of that equation, of course,  is enjoying their tunes. And that depends on your outlook: the intentionally  basic songs on the 23-minute <i>We Be Xuxa</i> lean heavily on aggression  and energy.</p>
<p>For those who like their music  brief and stupid-simple (and appreciate the various strains of the punk  canon Mika Miko are drawing upon), <i>We Be Xuxa</i> can be plenty of  fun. Its best tracks, such as shouty opener ""Blues Not Speed"", rumble  past at a violent clip with just enough time for the band to do its  damage and then peel out in the getaway car. The group has a healthy  sense of balance, too, and usually knows when to cut its bitterness  with sugar, like on the bouncy call-and-response of ""I Got a Lot (New  New New)"". But not all of the record's remaining moments achieve  such equilibrium, and since it operates in only two gears-- fast and  faster-- there's a tendency for its lesser songs to bleed into one  another and become indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Indeed, the similar-sounding  ""Wild Bore"" and ""Sex"" might as well be one song, and the distinction  between neighboring tracks ""On the Rise"" and ""Beat the Rush""  doesn't really exist. That's a problem on a record this short, and  generally speaking, <i>We Be Xuxa </i>would<i> </i>benefit from more genre  variety. Ironically, when the band does occasionally fiddle with other  styles-- notably on the very convincing no-wave boogie of ""Totion""  and their cover of the Urinals' ""Sex""-- they  produce some of the record's most memorable material. Something tells  me, though, that Mika Miko aren't really <i>that</i> interested in  deeper genre explorations or crafting a grand concept piece. They're  about turning kids onto punk rock at sweat-soaked backyard parties,  and that's pretty cool too.</p></div>"|13010.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13010-we-be-xuxa/|6.5|Joe Colly

They've been directly sampled for a Ghostface track  (their ""Musings to Myself"" formed the backbone of ""Shakey Dog  Starring Lolita""), they've backed up the Wu-Tang Clan and various  solo members in a live-show capacity, and they've recorded new backing  tracks in the studio with Raekwon (namely a 2007 remake of his noir-soul  Pete Rock collabo ""PJ's""). And between all that, they somehow  found the time to release a couple of 7"" records featuring their reinterpretations  of four of the RZA's most iconic beats: ""C.R.E.A.M."", ""Glaciers  of Ice"", ""Duel of the Iron Mic"", and ""Bring the Ruckus"". That  side project eventually expanded into their new album <i>Enter the 37th Chamber</i>, their second full-length and an instant rap-geek curio  for anyone who likes hearing bands cross the bounds of sample-based  and live hip-hop instrumentation.</p>
<p>What the El Michels Affair  have subsequently come up with is a weird little diversion that's  as interesting for its unexpected detours and minor blasphemies as it  is for its familiarity. When you're working with reinterpretations  of music that often distorted the workings of 1960s and 70s soul  into grimy, warped territory, it's almost impossible to play it on  standard instruments without having to reel it back in just a little.  Just to give you an idea of what we're working with here, their version  of ""Uzi (Pinky Ring)"" is a little over three minutes long, and the  horns that kicked the door down from the get-go in the original Wu-Tang  track don't even come in until after a minute or so of drums-bass-guitar  vamping. This and other tweaks-- drastically abbreviating ""Mystery  of Chessboxin'"" and spending a third of its length on a melting-analog  intro that sounds more like Dr. Octagon's ""Blue Flowers"", or sweetening  those spare, piercing string notes from ""Duel of the Iron Mics"" into  a weepy violin solo-- could be a natural result of a band trying to  make the structure of a loop-based backing track a bit more dynamic  in a purely instrumental context.</p>
<p>And sometimes they extend it  to the point where they kind of lose the original tracks' spirits.  Despite their ability to play to a range of moods, as displayed on their  fine 2005 debut <i>Sounding out the City</i>, the Affair decided to  make even the lighthearted and triumphant moments in their trip through  the Wu catalog sound sinister and grim. That includes the jaunty, Dr.  Buzzard's-quoting intro of ""Cherchez La Ghost"" and the manic, giggly piano loop from ""Shimmy Shimmy  Ya"", both of which now sound a bit more like theme music for white-mustached  Shaw Brothers villains. And many of these tracks-- fun interpretations  as many of them are-- still sound like they're sorely missing the  MCs they were originally crafted for, a situation some enterprising  mash-up artists are free to try and rectify.</p>
<p>But fitting the RZA's productions  to a 1:1 ratio isn't quite the point here, even if their approach  is still reasonably reverent. <i>Enter the  37th Chamber </i> works best as a series of familiar touchstones sifted through a filter  of hazy, almost psychedelic mud-fidelity gloom, getting at the sorrow  and menace of classic Wu-Tang at a somewhat different angle. The Affair  have a similar ear for diabolical soul sonics and 42nd St.  cinema atmosphere as the RZA, but they get to it through a more organic  (or at least organic-sounding) route, transforming split-second snippets  into fleshed-out licks and choppy loops into glass-smooth riffs. ""C.R.E.A.M.""  is the highlight of the set, sweetening the horns, pushing a shivering,  stinging guitar melody to a more prominent role and giving that iconic  piano riff an understated jolt. ""Criminology"" is a little pared  down-- the original's thousand-horn swagger feels a touch lighter  in the brass department-- but those stuttering vibes are replicated  beautifully and that loping bass-drum backbeat still swings its shoulders  wide. And ""Protect Ya Neck""-- well, it sounds like an unusually  badass Booker T. &amp; the MGs' instrumental from 1968, which does  justice to the Stax/Volt side of RZA's affections. In <i>The 36th Chamber of Shaolin</i>, the movie that inspired the Wu-Tang Clan's  debut album title, Gordon Liu masters his training in all 35 chambers  of Shaolin and subsequently forms the 36th as a way to teach  others outside the temple.

Which really came as a shock, since I can't remember another band since probably Elbow that sounded more mature and fully-formed on their debut. But whereas the latter's <i>Asleep In The Back </i>came on the heels of 10 years of formula-tweaking and bad breaks, <i>Checkmate Savage </i>evolved from winding jam sessions caught on tape by Paul Savage of the Delgados in a nuanced production that isn't too far off from what some would call ""dad rock"". If your dad happened to have Neu! or Beefheart records stashed somewhere, that is.</p>
<p>It cuts both ways, though. While Phantom Band play with the assurance of a band far into its career, at times, their approach is so restrained and tasteful that you almost wish they'd show their age more. But it's hard not to sound a little wise beyond your years with the kind of voice flexed by Richard Anthony, falling somewhere on the brogue wave between the frontmen of the Twilight Sad and Frightened Rabbit. But Anthony is more likely to invoke spectral beings in a voice that's got a leathery quality of being both tough and yet luxurious at the same time. ""The Howling"" works itself into a nice pocket with well-placed handclaps and a ringing, cheerful guitar refrain that could have easily been the result of a Keef goof-- the band claims that part of their jam sessions would involve as much parody as woodshedding.  It's easy to imagine Anthony elbow-on-knee, fist-on-chin, so commanding and steady is his guidance over the aerodynamic arrangement. It's an undeniably potent beginning, and a welcome dose of muscle in a milieu that often stripmines: comparatively, Deerhunter's ""Nothing Ever Happened"" might sound as thin as, well, Bradford Cox.</p>
<p>But muscle does become something of a necessity, since despite their Teutonic underpinnings, the Phantom Band don't exactly groove (like, say, Fujiya &amp; Miyagi) so much as they clamp down and lock in. ""Left Hand Wave"" hitches the gold standard for 21st-century kraut (Radiohead's ""The National Anthem"") to a forceful, bucking bronco rhythm while ""Crocodile"" is the all-encompassing Stereolab encomium that incorporates an assortment of home-made percussion into a bristling, upward space race.</p>
<p>But some of the more strictly rhythmic numbers invariably fall flat when they merely dabble in songcraft-- ""Burial Sounds"" never quite extricates itself from a swampy, tom-lead beat while the hip-swiveling chorus of ""Folk Song Oblivion"" is a welcome respite from the strangely tuneless Drop-D grunge of the verses.  In a record full of big songs, ""Island"" stands as the obvious money shot, a near-nine-minute séance of later Talk Talk.  On its face, it passes the looks test, an inky guitar figure echoed by Anthony's spiritual invocations, and later the rest of the band in a ragged chorale. But it lacks a sense of real movement, instead rousting about in its pewter casing.</p>
<p>But while <i>Checkmate Savage </i> isn't exactly a record that lacks levity, but the end of ""Throwing Bones"" does cast its surroundings in a different light, particularly after ""Island"". Taken as a whole, it's a chipper diversion, and then you get <i>Checkmate</i>'s biggest right hook, a near-barbershop tidal pool of vocals that eventually bridge the gap towards the resigned yet optimistic sundown closer ""The Whole Is on My Side"". Does it work? In a way, not really-- it sounds like something of a send-up of TV on the Radio's ""Ambulance"" (particularly the lower ""ba-doo-ba-doo's""), and while that's a group that could certainly use a pinprick in their side, it's something of a distraction on its own merits. But it does remind the listener about what their most compatible predecessor, the Beta Band, as intriguing as they were infuriating. The Phantom Band has a vice grip on their aesthetic-- in the future, they'd be well-served to know when to let go.</p></div>"|12838.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12838-checkmate-savage/|7.3|Ian Cohen

Even my favorite ones, I kinda zone out for most of it.... There's just a visceral thing that never translates very well."" That's none other than Mr. Arcade Fire, Win Butler, talking to this website about his band's risky recent documentary, <i>Miroir Noir</i>. And he's absolutely right. Like most notable rock films-- from <i>Don't Look Back</i> to <i>Gimme Shelter</i> to recent winner <i>Glastonbury</i>-- <i>Miroir Noir </i>isn't a mere chronicle of a band on a stage playing to people who are singing along. The film features bits of recording-session footage and offbeat montages along with grainy snips of shows; by adding elements of non-show spontaneity, <i>Miroir Noir</i> translates a real live gig's snap that much better. <i>Arctic Monkeys at the Apollo</i>-- which was released in the UK last November and hits the U.S. this week with a bonus live CD-- shows the Sheffield quartet on stage at the Manchester Apollo playing to people who are singing along. The end. You are now permitted to zone out.</p>
<p>Well, not just yet, maybe. <i>Apollo </i>at least attempts to be more than just another concert movie. Instead of going with quick cuts and crisp-but-soulless HD video, editor Nick Fenton (Sigur Rós' <i>Heima</i>) favors longer tracking shots and director Richard Ayoade (""The Mighty Boosh"") and director of photography Danny Cohen (<i>This Is England</i>) go with Super 16 film to give the piece a more cinematic feel. But there's only so much one can do with lens flares and light trails (there are plenty of both throughout). The relatively artistic filming techniques are worn out within the first 10 minutes of the 76-minute movie. So it's up to the Monkeys themselves to put on the show of their lives-- to make something worth popping in the DVD player for years to come.</p>
<p>Too bad this band isn't ready for such a document. They've got songs and charisma, but not enough to support a release like <i>Apollo </i>just yet. It's the last concert of their 2007 world tour, but instead of leaving all their sweat and/or guts on the floor, they just look a bit tired. And while lead singer Alex Turner's wise ass snarl comes through on record, his brattiness almost reads as condescension here-- he tells the Manchester audience they're being fed to the center of Berlin via satellite as a joke, but nobody really gets it.</p>
<p>The crowd is given short-shrift throughout, too; their vocal participation is largely muted and the cameras stay trained on the Monkeys the whole time, giving the film a hermetic feel, as if it were taped in an antiseptic studio. Aside from drummer Matt Helders, whose technical skill and enthusiasm is admirable here, the Monkeys teeter between off-the-cuff and off-the-mark; there is a difference between fuck-all and fuck-off. Songs that allow Turner to breathe-- ""Do Me a Favour"", ""505"", ""When the Sun Goes Down""-- offer a little release from the wound-up monotony, but they're not enough.</p>
<p>Concert DVDs are a good, cheap way for record companies to recoup losses from the decline of album sales but, as more and more flood the market, their second-hand POV quickly becomes ineffectual. Because, without any sort of originality, innovation, or personality, something like <i>Apollo </i>may as well be a YouTube fan clip. (At least that way we could have heard the real-life audience reactions.) Arctic Monkeys try to keep it respectable with experienced men behind the cameras and just-grainy-enough film stock, but all that is moot without something compelling to watch. This is frustrating, especially since <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/ArcticMonkeys"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recent YouTube videos with Diddy</a> prove these guys have humor and chumminess to spare-- why not work that into this DVD at some point? Near the very end of <i>Apollo</i>, the film abruptly and briefly cuts to a quick moving reel of behind-the-scenes footage of the band goofing around. They make weird faces, Turner hammily leads the camera to a picturesque oceanside locale. It's a great montage-- and it's over in 30 seconds.</p></div>"|13014.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13014-arctic-monkeys-at-the-apollo/|4.5|Ryan Dombal

Rather  than looking at how that scene died, it's interesting to see how many  of those festival headliners-- Fisherspooner, Peaches, Ladytron, Scissor  Sisters-- survived. (Not to mention that nobody sniffs at later electro-pop bands like Hot Chip, Justice, Crystal Castles, CSS, etc.) Maybe the key for the the duo behind Fisherspooner  (composer Warren Fischer and singer/performer Casey Spooner) is that they don't  consider themselves ""dance musicians"" in the conventional  sense. ""I mean our music isn't really dance music,"" Fischer told  Pitchfork's Tom Breihan in a recent interview. ""I don't really know  what genre it would lie in. I guess it's kind of like indie pop or pop  music.""</p>
<p>They always were, and still consider themselves, an art project first  (notice he says ""our music"" rather than ""we""). As  they said, they get commissioned for dance pieces (the kind performed  in concert halls), not for remixes. Their shows are built on spectacle  rather than the charisma of any one of their players, including frontman  Spooner. Unfortunately for a band that tries to turn glitter and polish  into art, <i>Entertainment</i> is a lackluster performance. Here they  almost become the indie pop group they claim they've always been, but  the irony of their cries against capitalism and artifice ultimately  fail without compelling songs to keep them afloat.</p>
<p><i>Entertainment </i>begins promisingly. Lush opener ""The  Best Revenge"" scans as old Fischerspooner sleaze for its first few  seconds, but then the track shudders awake with broken keyboard notes  and a dated but delightful horn line-- the kind where you hope someone  yells ""Blow, daddy!"" But no one ever does. ""At what cost? There  is a price,"" warns Spooner. He lives by this admonishment throughout <i> Entertainment</i> (the title perhaps evoking that other anti-capitalist  ""dance"" band, Gang of Four). The stance is funny (though understandable)  coming from a band you'd always suspect was created exclusively for  readers of <i>BlackBook</i>. Some of his warnings-- ""Currency can only do  so much"" (""Money Can't Dance""), ""What's real? What's fake""  (""In a Modern World""), or ""It's no one's fault but our own,""  from their slippery anti-war track ""Infidels of the World Unite"", ring insincere, an unfortunate side-effect of Spooner's deadened vocals.</p>
<p>Fischerspooner's  bolder attempts at pop, like the flute-backed twee verse towards the  end of ""Money Can't Dance"" and the more personal ""Door Train  Home"", hint at something more interesting. The latter song is unusual  here: though Spooner's still deadpan, his specificity and intimate  lyrics make up for the rather broad strokes of sawtooth synth and whining  guitar from his partner. But there are far too many tracks on <i>Entertainment</i> where both members are sleepwalking. ""We Are Electric"" comes off  particularly half-hearted; Fischer cycles the song's tinny, repetitive  synth pattern though different filters while Spooner intones the title  line over and over. Both halves play like they were written for different  songs with no thought given to how they'd get along.</p>
<p>For a group not making dance music, their danciest tracks are still  their best. ""To the Moon"" coalesces in all the right ways: found  audio detritus blends into a likable, warm synth melody and a layered,  exultant beat. Slivers of violin and keyboards are inserted into all the  best spots, and even Spooner finds an elementary vocal melody before  backing out gracefully. It works in <i>this</i> context, for a group  that seems all about context. Like, ""Danse En France""'s textured,  fractured pieces and spoken intro don't work until you know that the  song was commissioned for a particular dance company, and is based on  a hilarious story of casual sex via boneheaded Americanism. So <i>Entertainment</i> might be music for their performances, it might be for others' dance  performances, but it's not for the dance floor. Those halves that don't  quite fit? They're begging to be pulled apart and put back together  by heavier hands.</p></div>"|13013.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13013-entertainment/|5.8|Jessica Suarez

His first two records, <i>Walking Without Effort </i>and <i>The Novelist</i>,  came out on as a double album in 2005 on Secretly Canadian, and he's been putting out music in dribs and drabs ever since then. All of it has been perfectly competent but a little dull, suggesting an MOR-indie mind-meld of Ron Sexsmith, Michael Penn, and Andrew Bird. On last year's head-turning <i>Ground Trouble Jaw</i> EP, however, Swift switched things up, ditching the midtempo piano ballads for strutting, ersatz blue-eyed soul and warbling in a killer, outrageously goofy Frank Zappa-meets-Bobby Darrin falsetto over loving recreations of Spencer Davis Group oldies. The EP was slight but unexpectedly winning, and it signaled a shift in direction that sets the stage nicely for the grander affair that is <i>The Atlantic Ocean</i>, his first proper full-length since 2007's <i>Dressed Up For the Letdown</i>. Wisely keeping the looseness he found on  <i>Ground Trouble Jaw</i>, Swift spruces everything else up with the sort of painstaking classicist touches that overly ambitious singer/songwriters have spent hours in the studio refining since at least Todd Rundgren's <i>Something/Anything?</i>.</p>
<p>Rundgren's soft-rock opus actually makes for a decent entry point into <i>The Atlantic Ocean</i>. Like Rundgren, Swift slips a surprising amount of bitterness and acrid observation into his smooth AM-radio soul songs, which are built on the laid-back earthiness and jazzy chord voicings of 1970s Carole King. ""Spend your prayers, I'm an unbeliever and I don't feel right/ I can barely sleep at night/ Got no one to make me cry/ And everyone knows when they're gonna die,"" he croons beautifully on ""R.I.P."" (Man, that Starflyer 59 breakup must have been <i>brutal</i>.) Both have a fondness for injecting blurts of ""wacky"" studio noise into their compositions; see the quivering jello mold of keyboards perched atop ""The Original Thought"". Also like Rundgren, Swift spends a lot of time honing the most devastating takedown of his exes he can manage while finding the prettiest way to couch it. ""It's already gone, hang your head, hold your tongue/ Because it's nobody's fault but our own,"" he sings sweetly over the lilting waltz  rhythms of ""Already Gone"".</p>
<p>Rundgren isn't the only obsessive studio rat Swift will remind you of, though.  ""Ballad of Old What's His Name"" is a nice compendium of all of Swift's touchpoints: slide guitar lines that ape George  Harrison's tone and cadence so closely that you almost check to make sure you didn't accidentally put on ""Savoy Truffle""; barrelhouse piano and an airy vocal melody that evokes Harry Nilsson; a harmonizing backup choir of sweetly sighing Swifts; and an outbreak of horn charts at the bridge. ""The First Time"", on the other hand, opens with a chugging little drum machine and a single plunking banjo, sounding before the verse begins for all the world like the work of the blonder, prettier Swift. ""The End of an Age"", meanwhile, has a sweetly autumnal horn coda that could have been ported in from a Burt Bacharach song.</p>
<p>All of this namechecking, by the way, tends to pop up in reviews when the album in question isn't quite vivid enough to stand on its own terms, and, well, check: Swift is hugely talented musician and a meticulous craftsman, but his voice isn't terribly distinct, and as a result his albums usually end up being a bundle of good ideas lacking an animating force. Swift has figured out how to make pretty music, but he hasn't found anything compelling to say through it. ""I got the right LPs, I got the Lou Reed and all the Blondie you'll never need,"" he sings on the title track, and it illustrates, once again, the wide gulf separating an immaculate record collection from the ability to do anything interesting with it.</p></div>"|12990.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12990-the-atlantic-ocean/|6.3|Jayson Greene

Scott Myers painted a house for the cover, set in the  middle distance but crowded off to the side, overlooking a geometrically  jagged shoreline. Nine years, four albums, and two labels later, Myers  has painted his fifth Manx cover (sixth if you count the one for their  2003 EP <i>Afternoon Owls</i>), this time a photorealistic cathedral  so gargantuan it can't all fit into the frame. This evolution  from a house of man to a house of god is potentially misleading, as  the North Carolina band has made no such spiritual or musical evolution. They've  remained about the same size, picking up new tricks with every album  but barely changing their approach at all. Sure, they were fuzzier and  scratchier on middle child <i>Aztec Discipline</i>, but they soon abandoned  that tack.</p>
<p>Not that they need to change things  up all that much. Their shambling, subdued, sophisticated Southern  folk-pop-- which is soft but never mellow, and uses slow tempos almost  as a statement of defiance-- sprung forth fully formed in 2000, and  since then they've explored different facets of that sound, turning  it over in their hands to study every angle and possibility. On <i>Ascenseur  Ouvert!</i>, their sound remains as durable, as engaging, and as immersive  as ever, their lyrics gently witty and their arrangements subtly intricate.  ""I never walked on water but I keep my body dry,"" sings Bill Taylor  on the loping opener ""Walk on Water"". ""A dirty hand wipes dusty cobwebs  from my eyes."" That couplet, boosted by Ryan Richardson's harmonies,  sounds crucial to the album: Perhaps it's an acknowledgment of the  four long years between their last album and this one. Real life intrudes:  There have been new babies, jobs that actually pay, moves, upheavals.</p>
<p>But those lines also suggest that the  Kingsbury Manx know they have always flown under the radar, never even  becoming indie big or internet famous. Their music is not flashy, but  observant and adult, and <i>Ascenseur Ouvert!</i>, which is their first  for Carrboro-based Odessa Records, may be their most engaging and cohesive  album since their first, maybe their second. Perhaps the years away  have sharpened their focus and made these recording sessions seem all  the more do-or-die (another full circle: They recorded the album in  Duck Kee Studio in Mebane, North Carolina, where they worked on their  debut).</p>
<p><i>Ascenseur Ouvert!</i> strikes their  finest balance so far between sonics and songcraft. These are well-put-together  compositions full of clever turns of phrase and crisp imagery. At times  it sounds like a potential break-up album, juggling what-might-have-beens  with what-really-went-downs. On ""Mend/Move"", the song with the most  spring in its step tempo-wise, Taylor promises, ""I'd never write  a song just to try to poke fun at you/ No, I'd never do you wrong even though I'm all done with you."" On the first few listens, that  sounds like a diplomatic gesture toward an ex, but ambiguity rises with  every listen: Does he even think she's worth writing about? Probably  not, since he uses that dismissive phrase ""I'm all done with you.""  Then again, he did write ""Mend/Move."" What sounds like a fond farewell  turns out to be just a farewell.</p>
<p>The Kingsbury Manx wrap that and every  other dodgy sentiment in music that sounds loose and casual despite  its complexity, peppering the songs with inspired flourishes.  A guitar zigs and zags jazzily throughout the strummy ""Well, Whatever"",  the relatively naked ""George Closing"" is nothing but warm vocals  and lonely piano, and  ""Over the Oeuvre"" pauses for a short  Beach Boyish vocal breakdown that shows off the band's lush harmonies. Their  voices have always blended effortlessly, adding a distinctive element  to their arrangements. In this regard, the loveliest and most inventive  track on <i>Ascenseur Ouvert!</i> may be the vocal-heavy ""Minos Maze"",  on which their wordless harmonies cascade over a soft bed of strings, synth tracers that shoot across the song. Its slow, patient tempo only  reinforces the song's impact, allowing them to fully invest themselves  in the moment. Often accused of sounding the same on every album-- as if  reliability and focus were faults-- the Kingsbury Manx are really just  watching the world speed up around them and refusing to change their  pace to match.</p></div>"|12986.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12986-ascenseur-ouvert/|8.1|Stephen M.

I'm guessing she takes this as a mixed blessing: On the one hand, it's probably a little disheartening to consider that the bulk of her audience are DP fans curious about what else the band members might be up to. On the other hand, she's probably fine with the attention, considering that a near-heartbreaking number of albums just as passionate and lovingly crafted as <i>Mind Raft</i> go totally ignored because of time and space limitations.</p>
<p>Deradoorian's sound is almost the opposite of the Projectors'-- slow, droning, R&amp;B-influenced folk splattered with blue notes and big drums. (Her own flippant but apt description of <i>Mind Raft</i> is ""An EP with five gothed-out psych tracks for you to do drugs to, or something."" Or something. Listening to the Projectors' convulsive, pointillistic music, it doesn't take a feat of empathy to imagine she needs a breather.) Though the instrumentals are heavy, it's her voice that anchors-- a waxy, seductive instrument that, along with Amber Coffman's, has come to define the Dirty Projectors' sound as much as Dave Longstreth's convulsive squawk. And here, she gets even more room to flaunt its range and character: The sheepish demurrals of indie with the muscle and flutter of genuine R&amp;B; the near-operatic countermelodies of ""Weed Jam"" unfurling into steamy murmurs on ""High Road""; the backing vocals on ""Moon"" that sound like dissonant Bosnian folk. The lyrics are, to my sensibilities, slight, but that's basically irrelevant-- her voice is often so intoxicating that stepping back from my stoked and thoughtless lizard brain to parse her English feels like a waste of concentration (not to mention insulting to her voice). But the songs wander and churn when it feels like they could develop, and ultimately, it's a record that I'll never mind having on but probably rarely reach for. (Oddly, for all the EP's quiet eclecticism, it's the relatively straightforward blues dirge ""Holding Pattern"" that I find stickiest.)</p>
<p>Isn't there some cute aphorism about how napkin sketches by innately talented artists are more fascinating than the dedicated brushwork of someone who, on some inaccessible and deep spiritual level, will just never get it? If not, imagine that there is, because I'm going to need for you consider it now. <i>Mind Raft</i>, for its probably good intentions, sounds like sketches from a young musician with obvious talent who hasn't exerted herself just yet. I realize I'm doing some rhetorical hand-wringing here: For all I know, these five songs required a huge amount of effort and will be the closest Deradoorian gets to the godhead-- but I just don't think that's the case. She's 22, very capable, and her stylistic blend is more interesting and unusual than that of plenty of her peers. If you need a hand reconciling the numerical score with that bit of clinical gloss, I'll just say that if I had to review Dave Longstreth's first solo album, 2002's <i>The Graceful Fallen Mango</i>, I don't know that I could confidently say it's all that much better than Deradoorian's is. To the future.</p></div>"|12995.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12995-mind-raft/|5.8|Mike Powell

So on a superficial level the  main differences between <i>Set 'Em Wild, Set 'Em Free</i> and Akron's previous work is the departure of Ryan  Vanderhoof (who left after recording <i>Love Is Simple</i>) and that  they're now releasing those strained analogies on Dead Oceans instead  of Michael Gira's Young God.</p>
<p>Anybody worried that it was Gira's  skeletal hand that was keeping the Family weird can rest easy. Opener ""Everyone Is  Guilty"" skips groove in favor of skronk, employing a hard, scat-worthy  verse vocal and billowing, aggressive guitar breaks.  The song  ends with a small, creeping symphony-- horns, strings, and a flute carrying  the song to a peaceable conclusion. It's a strident opener,  one that signals <i>Set  ‘Em Wild</i> will trend darker than 2007's excellent <i> Love Is Simple</i>.  Remaining members Seth Olinsky, Miles Seaton,  and Dana Janssen usually skew toward the abstract lyrically, making  it difficult to say <i>Set 'Em</i> is ""about"" anything, but  the album's final line-- ""Last year was a hard year/ For such a long  time/ This year's gonna be ours""-- and title point toward  an airing of grievances.  Either way, the vibe doesn't seem to  be anger so much as perseverance, especially during the album's balmy,  tempered middle.</p>
<p>During that middle section, <i>Set  ‘Em Wild</i> balances the strangeness of tracks like ""Everyone Is  Guilty"" with worthy but, you know, <i>normal</i> art-rock.  ""River""  doesn't necessarily follow standard rock patterns, but the way its  instruments interact-- pattering toms enter with robust guitar licks,  a tempered horn solo on the bridge-- is decidedly regular.  The  title track's country-pastoral lope or ""Many Ghosts""' eerie  balladry are slight tweaks on formulas.  Cryptic, pretty statements  are floated: ""You are no longer river to me... You are no longer docile  stream.""    For all of their idiosyncrasies and Zeus-ian  chest baring, the differences between Akron and everyrocker troupes  like Arcade Fire or Broken Social Scene aren't always so large.</p>
<p>This isn't a slight (though the mewling  ""The Alps &amp; Their Orange Evergreen"" is the closest the band  has ever come to unplugged alterna-rock), especially because Akron use  their most traditional moments as launching pads for their freak.  What  other reason to sequence the album's two oddest tracks-- the crashing  clay guitars of ""MBF"" and the beefy ""They Will Appear""-- after the album's comparatively placid middle third?  Those songs recall the woolly prog-epics the band explored on 2006's <i> Meek Warrior</i>; here, though, they feel welcomingly  disruptive.</p>
<p>The band's now-routine gospel-like chanting grows tiresome by album end (they miss Vanderhoof's  vocals), and, as was expected, <i>Set  ‘Em Wild</i> doesn't necessarily expand the band's sound so much  as further splinter their interest.  Brief ear-piquing moments-- the white noise fadeout of ""Sun Will Shine (Warmth  of the Sunship Version)"" is followed by a boozy horn section playing ""Auld Lang Syne"",  but at this point in the band's development even that doesn't shock.   Celebratory standards, talk of a ""geese nation,"" tie-dyed American  flags...despite the changes this is still the same Family.</p></div>"|12980.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12980-set-em-wild-set-em-free/|6.4|Andrew Gaerig

No, it's not. So please don't  call <i>Balf Quarry </i>a repeat of <i>BOSS</i>,<i> </i>Magik Markers' excellent  2007 album<i>. </i>I understand the temptation-- like its predecessor, <i> Balf Quarry </i>channels this duo's noisy leanings into simpler songs  without sacrificing the band's fiery energy. There are even some direct parallels--  the best song here, the chugging ""Don't Talk in Your Sleep"",  bears echoes of <i>BOSS</i>' single ""Taste"", while the raging  ""Jerks"" recalls <i>BOSS</i>' ""Body Rot"". And when  heard in light of a 20-plus release discography (including at least  seven since <i>BOSS</i>), <i>Balf Quarry </i> certainly sounds more like <i>BOSS </i> than anything else the band has done.</p>
<p>But it takes only a few listens  to realize that this album is its own beast. Even with healthy doses  of unruliness and a few far-off wanderings, this is Magik Markers' most  coherent, self-contained effort to date. A friend called it ""a  road trip into the basement,"" and that pretty well captures the  album's America-in-the-rear-view-mirror vibe. As the smoky grooves roll  by, it's easy to picture singer/guitarist Elisa Ambrogio and drummer  Pete Nolan camped out in a cellar, dreaming that their loose, swaying  songs are treks down a hazy, endless highway.</p>
<p>""Smash out the glass of  the dashboard clocks/ Drive straight into the West,"" Ambrogio  sings in opener ""Risperdal"", a diary of a country where ""America's  past pays America's rent"" and ""High schoolers and Haggard  know what I know."" (At song's end, Ambrogio changes that line to  ""High schoolers and Hagerty""-- perhaps a nod to Neil Hagerty and  Royal Trux, a band who could also sound like they were concocting alternate <i>Easy  Rider </i>soundtracks from the comfort of dank underground dwellings).</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Ambrogio drops numerous  references to road-drenched Americana. Her songs are littered with gamblers,  lawmen, whiskey, and losing lottery tickets. This makes <i>Balf Quarry </i> something like a 1970s indie film shot through a modern-day lens, similar  to the way Vincent Gallo's <i>The Brown Bunny </i> felt like a simultaneously faded and updated road-movie replica. So  you probably need some penchant for American nostalgia and noisy stoner-rock  to dig very far into <i>Balf Quarry</i>. But if you can hack it, there  are pots of gold along the album's wayward avenues.</p>
<p>On ""Psychosomatic"",  clipped guitar and cutting drums embolden Ambrogio's screed against  thinking too hard (""If you start looking, do you know what you'll  find?"") Later, a crunchy electronic beat buttresses Ambrogio and  Nolan's vocal duo on the love-song-ish ""7/23"". That's followed  by the even more surprising ""State Numbers"", a ballad about  the dangers of gambling featuring Nolan on piano and producer Scott  Colburn on ""wizard wind."" ""Luck never gives, it only  lends,"" Ambrogio warns over the music's haunting tones.</p>
<p>Her most pointed rant, ""The  Lighter Side of...Hippies"", is an indictment of something bigger:  60s idealism. ""You had a revolution in your head/ Too bad you  couldn't make it out of bed,"" she snarls, telling the boomers that  ""your heroes lied."" In fact, here she wholly rejects the road  fantasies that <i>Balf Quarry </i>had hinted at before: ""No more  forever young on the turnpike/ The sunshine visions were not what they  seemed."" But even <i>Easy Rider </i> itself ended with Peter Fonda deciding that ""we blew it,""  and the dreams and disappointments Ambrogio sings about are often intertwined. <i>Balf  Quarry </i>is the kind of record that can handle such rich, entertaining  contradictions.</p></div>"|13004.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13004-balf-quarry/|7.5|Marc Masters

Of course, East London quintet the Horrors didn't do themselves any favors by presenting themselves in a conceptual wrapping that seemingly had all the staying power of last night's mascara, mining a well-tapped vein of ghoulish American garage-rock, prancing around in cartoonishly goth get-ups, and putting on sloppy, self-sabotaging 15-minute sets, all for the amusement of their celebrity guest list. But the band's media-saturated ascent distracted from the fact that the Horrors had actually done their homework: Their 2006 debut EP featured covers of two Joe Meek-produced, <i>Pebbles</i>-approved classics and on the subsequent tour, the band's pre-show PA mix included tracks by the Seeds, the Cramps, and Gun Club. And after struggling to keep the shock-rock shtick fresh over the entirety of 2007's <i>Strange House</i> full-length, the Horrors were smart enough to recognize garage-rock's aesthetic limitations-- and that the very sort of garage-rock purist who would appreciate a good cover of Screaming Lord Sutch's ""Jack the Ripper"" had probably already written them off on the basis of their poofy haircuts.</p>
<p>And so the Horrors' desire to make campy, B-movie-inspired punk-rock seems to have died along with Lux Interior. Their second album, <i>Primary Colours</i>, contains no haunted-house Farfisa organ drones, no blues-rock riffing and no songs about graveyards or murderers, a change reflected in their choice of producers; where <i>Strange House</i> was helmed by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner, the expansive sound of <i>Primary Colours</i> was fashioned by the trio of Geoff Barrow (Portishead), Craig Silvey, and video director Chris Cunningam. The recently released first teaser from <i>Primary Colours</i>, ""Sea Within a Sea"", sees that production tandem's cinematic sensibility in full effect, with eight minutes of steely Krautrock propulsion that recasts lead shrieker Faris Badwan as a lovelorn crooner. On first listen, the song seems antithetical to the Horrors' patented goth-garage gimmickry; but the amazing thing about <i>Primary Colours</i> is that, by the time ""Sea Within a Sea"" appears as the album's come-down closer, the transition feels like a natural outcome.</p>
<p>There is, of course, clear precedent in transforming gothic gloom into psychedelic drone: After all, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Spacemen 3 and My Bloody Valentine-- all of whom loom large on <i>Primary Colours</i>-- were all big fans of the Cramps and the Birthday Party. But unlike downcast contemporaries like Crystal Stilts, the Horrors translate the influence of those avant-rock icons into swaggering, mass-appeal pop music: ""Three Decades"" may lean heavily on MBV-style flange-pedal contortions, but its driving momentum and Badwan's full-blooded delivery lend it an anthemic, open-road abandon, matched by uncommonly optimistic lyrics: ""Forget your regrets/ Don't lose your purpose, this is your heart!"" The song provides the first glimpse that, beneath his vampy visage, Badwan fancies himself a romantic. ""Do You Remember"" may sound like a readymade soundtrack for student-disco one night stands, but within its decadent, Suede-ian glam groove is a promise for long-term commitment, and in the beautifully brooding ballad ""Scarlet Fields"", the Horrors appropriate the melody of Joy Division's ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" but use it to convey hope instead of resignation.</p>
<p>The Horrors' shoegazer makeover aside, the real story here is Badwan's growing confidence as a singer, and his willingness to sound more scared than scary. <i>Primary Colours</i> loses its radiance when he reverts back to bogeyman type: ""New Ice Age"" sounds like a musty <i>Strange House</i> holdover, while ""I Can't Control Myself"" is a rewrite of Spiritualized's ""Come Together"" that-- in the absence of Jason Pierce's gospel choir and backing orchestra-- simply grinds its repetitive riff into the ground. But such regressions are a distant memory once we get sucked into ""Sea Within a Sea"", which, after you get beyond the ""hey, we bought a Can record"" novelty, proves to be something much more than a mere clinical exercise in record-collector rock. Rather, the song plays out as an analogue of the Horrors' own spiritual rebirth, its hypno-rock pulse turning more ominous and intense before a synth-triggered denouement introduces a melodic levity that breaks the song's air of despair and completes the Horrors' aesthetic liberation. For a band that's endured no lack of skepticism for their pre-fab packaging, it turns out the freakiest thing about the Horrors is that they're for real.</p></div>"|12998.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12998-primary-colours/|7.6|Stuart Berman

Soundtrack|3201.0|Odd Nosdam|['Rap']|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Anticon']|2009-05-07 00:00:00|2009|2016-06-11 19:04:54.638761|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".1dn2imyb3eo.1.6:0.1.0.$12993/=1$12993.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>It was my favorite record of  2008, so I suppose I'm inclined to overstate the influence of a stray  line from Why?'s <i>Alopecia. </i> Nonetheless, Yoni Wolf endorsed the sprawling catalogue of producer  David Madson aka Odd Nosdam on ""A Sky for Shoeing Horses Under""  by deadpanning, ""rain goes perfect with a Nosdam mixtape.""   Sure as hell got me interested.  And then Nosdam's first record  since then is... a soundtrack to an Element skateboarding video that  I'll probably never see.  And all I know about skateboarding  is what I unwittingly picked up hanging with the only other kids in  high school who listened to Ma$e <i>and</i> Dr. Octagon.</p>
<p>Strange as it sounds, that's  actually a decent set of coordinates for <i>T.I.M.E. Soundtrack</i>, which has  just enough polish and structure to appeal to those who aren't typically  checking for Anticon's version of weirdo hip-hop, but enough of a  crate-diggers vibe to please those who are.  It's less a mixtape  than an appropriately compartmentalized series of segments, each long  enough to establish mood but never outstaying its welcome. Though Nosdam  always takes the opportunity to introduce new and often sensuous textures  and elements in each track, he never strays far from a grainy  boom-bap that provides enough muscle to justify Element's decision  to keep Pennywise out of this one. The synth sound that links ""T.I.M.E.  In"" and ""T.I.M.E. Out"" splits the difference between Swizz Beatz  and Heatmakerz, but in the latter portion, it's cooled down by ribbitting  tremolo guitar.  Meanwhile, the happy-go-lucky bass lick on ""Fly  Mode"" is the sort of thing that could sell a Volkswagen, and the rollicking  guitars on ""We Bad Apples"" functions as a tip that Nosdam might  have as much of a stake in making pop music than something to spit 16  over.</p>
<p>And yet, for all of the urgency  it's supposed to give way to, <i>T.I.M.E.</i> still can sound less  like something being played by an audio device as something revived  from your memory-- the two biggest influences here are  dust and shadow, not just the physical properties, but the capital letter  versions with the addendums ""-Brothers"" and ""DJ-.""  Amidst  so many tasty morsels, ""Top Rank"" can feel like a clearinghouse  at first, a five-minute exploration jammed right into the middle of <i> T.I.M.E. </i>In a good way, it reminds me of how ""Kingdom Come""  bisected the Mae Shi's <i>HLLLYH</i>-- essentially, it's an exploratory  roll call of all the good ideas interspersed throughout-- dubby bass,  the sort of snowdriven guitars heard on <i>The Campfire Headphase</i>,  hooky vibraphone.  If you're looking to find a mood that <i>T.I.M.E. </i> could be classified under, look no further than the title of the self-explanatory  ""Ethereal Slap"".</p>
<p>I guess it's indicative of  my own ignorance on the topic, but the line that always keeps popping  into my head is Steve Malkmus' tossed-off yet evocative ""Out on  my skateboard/ The night is just humming.""  In a way, it works-- <i> T.I.M.E.</i> is as visceral or cerebral as you'd like. While it's  easy to imagine people pulling killer kick flips or whatever in your  mind's eye while the album is playing, the music itself has enough  forthrightness and inventiveness to be one of the year's most enjoyable,  if low-key, surprises.</p></div>"|12993.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12993-time-soundtrack/|7.8|Ian Cohen

<p>The blog's retirement was our loss as readers, even if its owner seems to have hung up his keyboard with a deserved sense of accomplishment rather than regret. But Ingram's finally turned to making music, or at least releasing it for public consumption. On his website, synthesizing the promotional announcement and the aesthetic manifesto, Ingram calls for 21st-century listeners to ""celebrate the integrity of hand-made art"" and ""discover the local."" Born from that back-to-basics mindset, these two EPs extoll the pleasures of the idiosyncratic and locally-grown at a time when critics often use the phrase ""niche-oriented"" as a pejorative.  <i> Automat </i> and  <i> East Central One </i> are extensions of Ingram's philosophy in both sound and presentation.</p>
<p>For starters, they're palm-sized 3"" CDs, each adorned with a linocut capturing the sharpened tips of London's gothic skyline, beautifully printed on pleasingly heavy stock. They have that warm DIY feel Ingram valorizes, but they're also stark, a little chilly-- handcrafts of the microchip era. (None of the sloppy cut-and-paste that characterizes the post-noise CD-R/cassette swap underground here.) And that organic/digital blurring extends to the eight tracks, four on each CD.</p>
<p><i>Automat </i> and (especially)  <i> East Central One </i> map the same coordinates as Woebot-the-blog: The bass-heavy history of modern British dance music, spiked with bits of jazz, post-industrial/punk, academic composition, and other semi-popular sounds. Perhaps literally culled from Ingram's omnivorous (but discerning) record collection and built on an old-school sampler, the tracks often have a pleasingly rough quality, their loops audibly punched-in from warm, worn vinyl. Drums clonk and tumble like dizzily pitched-down hip hop; sinister drones slither like avant horror-movie muzak in the background; phantom voices and mournful melodic motifs wind their way through the murk. At times, these EPs hearken back to the earliest, most stylistically unpredictable days of trip-hop and ""home-listening"" techno.</p>
<p><i>Automat</i>'s surreal appeal represents the side of Ingram's aesthetic that delights in alternately antic and gloomy grooves that bubble with strange samples. On ""Hit It"", it's James Brown's soulful grunts and a Bambaataa-era robot voice that leaven the spookiness. ""Cheese"", a duet for gloomy piano and techno-esque synth pings, would be ambient music of a particularly austere kind, if not for the repeated sample of a woman talking about making her own cheese. (Talk about celebrating the ""hand-made"" and ""local."") ""Bear Market Rally"", and its riot of stabbing jazz horns, is both whimsical and faintly unnerving, which is a pretty succinct description of the Woebot sound as a whole.</p>
<p><i>East Central One </i> is darker and riddled with fewer manic samples. Instead, it's the the drums that sound agitated on ""Chiblains"", which is drum and bass reduced to sketchy, tetchy snares and trilling strings. The low-end that pulses throughout both discs-- a heaviness that lingers even when the tracks are stripped of obvious basslines-- would seem to owe a bit to dubstep, as does the overall eerie mood. But instead of dubstep's fractured rhythms and recent taste for chirpy 8-bit video game sonics, the swooping strings of ""Salami"" evoke Duke Ellington's languorous ethno-fantasias.</p>
<p>There are faint hints of current and past genres-- trends, even-- audible on both EPs. But the logic behind Ingram's collage is wholly his own. Listening to  <i> ECO </i> closer ""Flapper"", it's hard to imagine anyone else who'd cut glitching I.D.M. with one bridge that sounds like a distended take on Eric Dolphy's  <i> Out To Lunch</i>, and another that nods in the direction of Mtume's smooth 80s electro-soul. This wild combination-- its creator's voice clearly audible even if its joints are not-- is a reminder that the best sample-based music has always possessed Ingram's ""integrity of hand-made art.""</p></div>"|12749.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12749-automat-ep-east-central-one-ep/|6.8|Jess Harvell

Thirty  years into his performing career, Cave's critical stock has arguably  never been higher, following the one-two punch of 2007's  Grinderman one-off and last year's Bad Seeds return <i>Dig!!! Lazarus,  Dig!!!</i> To wit, at similar points in their careers, Mick Jagger and Iggy  Pop were stocking used-CD-store bins with the likes of <i>Wandering Spirit</i> and <i>Naughty Little Doggie</i>.</p>
<p>Still, it can be difficult to reconcile  the diaper-clad zombie doing strange things to billy goats in the ""Nick  the Stripper"" video with the stately, sartorially blessed Renaissance  man who, over the past decade, has comfortably infiltrated the pop-cultural  establishment through acclaimed screenwriting efforts (2006's <i>The  Proposition</i>), Kylie Minogue duets, and crooning Beatles songs for Sean  Penn Oscar bait (<i>I Am Sam</i>). The 25th-anniversary reissues of his first  four solo albums provide a gauzy lens on how Cave went from fronting  one of rock's most volatile, destructive bands (The Birthday Party)  to one of its most enduring, redoubtable ones, the Bad Seeds. (They  also serve as a bittersweet end-of-an-era time capsule, what with the  recently announced departure of Cave's long-time foil, Mick Harvey.)  However, what you hear over the course of these albums is not the typical,  linear trajectory from chaos to control, but a series of sudden reinventions  and relapses. Like the temptation-plagued protagonists that figure in  his songs, Nick Cave's road to redemption is marked by sharp, sudden  detours back into the wild.</p>
<p>With Cave and Harvey recruiting Einsturzende  Neubauten's Blixa Bargeld, ex-Magazine bassist Barry Adamson, and guitarist  Hugo Race mere months after the Birthday Party's 1983 demise, the  collapsible sound of <i>From Her to Eternity</i> (1984) speaks to the Bad Seeds' hastily assembled origins and fluid instrumental roles. Cave may have  be in the throes of an infamous heroin habit that would both fuel and  plague him for most of the ensuing decade, but on <i>From Her </i>he sounds like he's in withdrawal from his former band, striving to  distance himself from the Birthday Party's junkyard punk, but occasionally  reverting to its shrieking hysterics (""Cabin Fever!"").</p>
<p>When removed  from the context of antagonizing a bar full of pissed-off Birthday Party  fans, some of the album's more provocative gestures now feel diffused: While the grim reading Leonard Cohen's ""Avalanche"" sees Cave already  aligning himself with pop's legendary outsiders, the black-cloud ambience  and gnashed-teeth delivery make it more closely resemble the opening  overture to <i>Goth: The Musical!</i> But with the unnerving piano pulse and  feedback spasms of ""From Her to Eternity"" and the murderous, militaristic  goose-step of ""Saint Huck"", the Bad Seeds refashion the Birthday  Party's post-punk splatter into something even more devious and powerful.  Here, the band aren't merely providing musical accompaniment to Cave's  nightmarish narratives; they're reacting to and manifesting them,  favoring space and tactility-- the lacerating scrapes of guitar strings,  the tremorous vibrations of piano chords-- over noise-for-noise's-sake.  And therein lies the evil genius of the early Bad Seeds: They re-imagined  the rock band as foley artists.</p>
<p>The opening track to the Bad Seeds'  second album, <i>The First Born Is Dead</i> (1985), elevates that cinematic  sensibility with the seven-minute, desert-storming  thriller ""Tupelo"", a song that, even if Cave had succumbed to his  smack habit in the mid-80s, would nonetheless have secured his legend.  Where most post-punk/New Pop artists of the day had abandoned contrarian  values to embrace concepts of affluence and technological progress,  Cave and the Bad Seeds went about digging up the deadest of dead horses:  the blues-- a music that, at the time, was being neutered into supper-club  smoothness by the likes of Eric Clapton and Robert Cray. But if the  back-to-roots tilt of <i>The First Born Is Dead</i>-- the first product of  the band's four-year relocation to Berlin-- stands in stark contrast  to the future-minded, sample-based pop music of the era, lyrically,  ""Tupelo"" is no less a masterful mash-up, weaving a breathless yarn  from strands of the Old Testament, the birth of Elvis and John Lee Hooker's  ""Tupelo Blues"" (itself a re-imagination of the namesake city's  history, casting it as a victim of the 1927 Mississippi River flood  that, in reality, had spared it). <i>The First Born Is Dead</i> is never quite  so bold again, adopting a more familiar bluesy swing on ""Say Goodbye  to the Little Girl Tree"" and last-call piano-bar warbling on ""Knocking  on Joe"", and when Cave bellows ""I am the Black Crow King"", you're  more likely to picture one of the Lizard variety. But in the raging reappropriation of Bob Dylan's ""Wanted Man"", <i>The First Born Is  Dead</i> feels like less of a genre exercise and more a distillation of the philosophy Cave would pursue for years to come-- i.e., when  it comes to search-and-destroy deviance, punk rock's got nothing on  wild-west outlaw history, old blues songs and the Bible.</p>
<p>If the Dylan covers and Hooker references  hadn't already established Cave's old-soul aspirations, for his  next move, he opted for a strategy that most aged entertainers resort  to when trying to revive their careers three decades in, let alone three  albums: the all-covers collection. In a sense, what Cave attempted with  <i>Kicking Against the Pricks</i> (1986) was not all that different than what  any one of us do when we hit a karaoke bar: Push ourselves out of our  comfort zones and have a bit of a laugh while doing so-- certainly,  the Bad Seeds have never sounded more cheerful than in the sloshed group  sing-along of the Velvets' ""All Tomorrow's Parties"" and the  cheeky, cowpoke reading of country ballad ""Long Black Veil"". But  while stacked with murder ballads that fit right into Cave's wheelhouse -- ""Hey Joe"", Hooker's ""I'm Gonna Kill That Woman""— what's  most remarkable about the album is the amount of conviction Cave invests  in his more schmaltzy selections. Rather than subject AM radio golden-oldies  like Jimmy Webb's ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"", Tom Jones'  ""Weeping Annaleah"", and Gene Pitney's ""Something's Gotten  a Hold of My Heart"" to contemptuous desecration, Cave sounds determined  to use them as vehicles to make him a better singer, and the Bad Seeds  a more sophisticated, stylistically diverse band.</p>
<p>Their next album would yield the real  fruits of the <i>Pricks</i> experiment: <i>Your Funeral... My Trial</i> (1986) showcases  Cave and the Bad Seeds' various modes and models with peak-form precision,  building up from the elegantly wasted reveries (""Sad Waters"", ""Stranger  Than Kindess""), creepy cabaret set pieces (""The Carny"") and exquisite  murder balladry (the title track) of the album's first act before  erupting into the show-stopping, whip-cracking surges (""Jack's Shadow"", ""She Fell Away"", a definitive cover of Tim Rose's ""Long Time  Man"") of the second. Every guise Nick Cave would assume from hereon  in-- from the dignified piano balladeer of 1990's <i>The Good Son</i> to  the mad preacher of 2004's <i>Abattoir Blues</i>-- can be traced back here;  indeed, even Grinderman's unhinged ""No Pussy Blues"" seems a touch  less feral once you get reacquainted with the blasphemous depravity  of <i>Your Funeral</i>'s ""Hard on for Love"", which intensifies its libidinous  thrust into rabid bloodlust and then abruptly cuts out when Cave hits  his frothy-mouthed fever pitch.</p>
<p>The Bad Seeds' final Berlin-based  recording-- 1988's <i>Tender Prey</i>, featuring certified Cave classics  ""The Mercy Seat"" and ""Deanna""-- is not a part of this initial  remaster series, presumably so Mute could reissue the band's eight  releases for the label in even blocks of four. However, its exclusion  also underscores the notion that <i>Your Funeral... My Tria</i><i>l</i> represents  the true apotheosis of the Bad Seeds, drawing from the strengths of  its three quite different predecessors-- the horror-film atmosphere  <i>of From Her to Eternity</i>, the apocalyptic oration of <i>The First Born Is  Dead</i>, the velvet-jacket suavity  of <i>Kicking Against the Pricks</i>-- into a superbly structured, singular work. Every bruised romantic  to emerge in its wake-- from PJ Harvey to the Tindersticks, Mark Lanegan  to the National-- owes it a tip of the syringe.</p>
<p>The timeless quality of Cave's songwriting  sources, and the live-in-the-room ethos employed by producer Flood mean  that these albums have aged infinitely better than most bands' mid-80s  output, bearing none of the technical sheen, studio gimmickry and drum  compression that dates so many records of the era. But these remasters  are still worthy additions for both long-time enthusiasts and recent,  post-Grinderman recruits. On top of revising the tracklists to their  original vinyl running orders (the old North American CD versions bizarrely  interspersed B-sides into the flow mid-album), the new mixes render  the Bad Seeds' <i>mise en scenes</i> even more nightmarishly vivid-- on  <i>From Her to Eternity</i>'s chain-gang howl ""Well of Misery"", Harvey's  percussive hits really do sound like hammers hitting rock, while the  multi-tracked madness of <i>Your Funeral</i>'s ""The Carny"" is about as  close as you'll get to having Cave read you a scary bedtime story  in your room.</p>
<p>The four issues are sold separately but,  in a clever gambit to make you buy all four, the discs are each appended  with sequential portions of Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard's accompanying  DVD documentary, titled <i>Do You Love Me</i>.

Thirty  years into his performing career, Cave's critical stock has arguably  never been higher, following the one-two punch of 2007's  Grinderman one-off and last year's Bad Seeds return <i>Dig!!! Lazarus,  Dig!!!</i> To wit, at similar points in their careers, Mick Jagger and Iggy  Pop were stocking used-CD-store bins with the likes of <i>Wandering Spirit</i> and <i>Naughty Little Doggie</i>.</p>
<p>Still, it can be difficult to reconcile  the diaper-clad zombie doing strange things to billy goats in the ""Nick  the Stripper"" video with the stately, sartorially blessed Renaissance  man who, over the past decade, has comfortably infiltrated the pop-cultural  establishment through acclaimed screenwriting efforts (2006's <i>The  Proposition</i>), Kylie Minogue duets, and crooning Beatles songs for Sean  Penn Oscar bait (<i>I Am Sam</i>). The 25th-anniversary reissues of his first  four solo albums provide a gauzy lens on how Cave went from fronting  one of rock's most volatile, destructive bands (The Birthday Party)  to one of its most enduring, redoubtable ones, the Bad Seeds. (They  also serve as a bittersweet end-of-an-era time capsule, what with the  recently announced departure of Cave's long-time foil, Mick Harvey.)  However, what you hear over the course of these albums is not the typical,  linear trajectory from chaos to control, but a series of sudden reinventions  and relapses. Like the temptation-plagued protagonists that figure in  his songs, Nick Cave's road to redemption is marked by sharp, sudden  detours back into the wild.</p>
<p>With Cave and Harvey recruiting Einsturzende  Neubauten's Blixa Bargeld, ex-Magazine bassist Barry Adamson, and guitarist  Hugo Race mere months after the Birthday Party's 1983 demise, the  collapsible sound of <i>From Her to Eternity</i> (1984) speaks to the Bad Seeds' hastily assembled origins and fluid instrumental roles. Cave may have  be in the throes of an infamous heroin habit that would both fuel and  plague him for most of the ensuing decade, but on <i>From Her </i>he sounds like he's in withdrawal from his former band, striving to  distance himself from the Birthday Party's junkyard punk, but occasionally  reverting to its shrieking hysterics (""Cabin Fever!"").</p>
<p>When removed  from the context of antagonizing a bar full of pissed-off Birthday Party  fans, some of the album's more provocative gestures now feel diffused: While the grim reading Leonard Cohen's ""Avalanche"" sees Cave already  aligning himself with pop's legendary outsiders, the black-cloud ambience  and gnashed-teeth delivery make it more closely resemble the opening  overture to <i>Goth: The Musical!</i> But with the unnerving piano pulse and  feedback spasms of ""From Her to Eternity"" and the murderous, militaristic  goose-step of ""Saint Huck"", the Bad Seeds refashion the Birthday  Party's post-punk splatter into something even more devious and powerful.  Here, the band aren't merely providing musical accompaniment to Cave's  nightmarish narratives; they're reacting to and manifesting them,  favoring space and tactility-- the lacerating scrapes of guitar strings,  the tremorous vibrations of piano chords-- over noise-for-noise's-sake.  And therein lies the evil genius of the early Bad Seeds: They re-imagined  the rock band as foley artists.</p>

My Trial|26031.0|Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds|['Rock', 'Experimental']|0.0|1.0|0.0|['Mute']|2009-05-06 00:00:00|2009|2016-06-11 19:04:56.919887|"<div class=""contents dropcap"" data-reactid="".1pwmm57ke80.1.6:0.1.0.$12949/=1$12949.0.3.2.0.1.0.1""><p>Unlike his predecessors in the fraternal  order of wild-child rock'n'roll frontmen, Nick Cave has shown  that aging and raging are not mutually exclusive properties. Thirty  years into his performing career, Cave's critical stock has arguably  never been higher, following the one-two punch of 2007's  Grinderman one-off and last year's Bad Seeds return <i>Dig!!! Lazarus,  Dig!!!</i> To wit, at similar points in their careers, Mick Jagger and Iggy  Pop were stocking used-CD-store bins with the likes of <i>Wandering Spirit</i> and <i>Naughty Little Doggie</i>.</p>
<p>Still, it can be difficult to reconcile  the diaper-clad zombie doing strange things to billy goats in the ""Nick  the Stripper"" video with the stately, sartorially blessed Renaissance  man who, over the past decade, has comfortably infiltrated the pop-cultural  establishment through acclaimed screenwriting efforts (2006's <i>The  Proposition</i>), Kylie Minogue duets, and crooning Beatles songs for Sean  Penn Oscar bait (<i>I Am Sam</i>). The 25th-anniversary reissues of his first  four solo albums provide a gauzy lens on how Cave went from fronting  one of rock's most volatile, destructive bands (The Birthday Party)  to one of its most enduring, redoubtable ones, the Bad Seeds. (They  also serve as a bittersweet end-of-an-era time capsule, what with the  recently announced departure of Cave's long-time foil, Mick Harvey.)  However, what you hear over the course of these albums is not the typical,  linear trajectory from chaos to control, but a series of sudden reinventions  and relapses. Like the temptation-plagued protagonists that figure in  his songs, Nick Cave's road to redemption is marked by sharp, sudden  detours back into the wild.</p>
<p>With Cave and Harvey recruiting Einsturzende  Neubauten's Blixa Bargeld, ex-Magazine bassist Barry Adamson, and guitarist  Hugo Race mere months after the Birthday Party's 1983 demise, the  collapsible sound of <i>From Her to Eternity</i> (1984) speaks to the Bad Seeds' hastily assembled origins and fluid instrumental roles. Cave may have  be in the throes of an infamous heroin habit that would both fuel and  plague him for most of the ensuing decade, but on <i>From Her </i>he sounds like he's in withdrawal from his former band, striving to  distance himself from the Birthday Party's junkyard punk, but occasionally  reverting to its shrieking hysterics (""Cabin Fever!"").</p>
<p>When removed  from the context of antagonizing a bar full of pissed-off Birthday Party  fans, some of the album's more provocative gestures now feel diffused: While the grim reading Leonard Cohen's ""Avalanche"" sees Cave already  aligning himself with pop's legendary outsiders, the black-cloud ambience  and gnashed-teeth delivery make it more closely resemble the opening  overture to <i>Goth: The Musical!</i> But with the unnerving piano pulse and  feedback spasms of ""From Her to Eternity"" and the murderous, militaristic  goose-step of ""Saint Huck"", the Bad Seeds refashion the Birthday  Party's post-punk splatter into something even more devious and powerful.  Here, the band aren't merely providing musical accompaniment to Cave's  nightmarish narratives; they're reacting to and manifesting them,  favoring space and tactility-- the lacerating scrapes of guitar strings,  the tremorous vibrations of piano chords-- over noise-for-noise's-sake.  And therein lies the evil genius of the early Bad Seeds: They re-imagined  the rock band as foley artists.</p>
<p>The opening track to the Bad Seeds'  second album, <i>The First Born Is Dead</i> (1985), elevates that cinematic  sensibility with the seven-minute, desert-storming  thriller ""Tupelo"", a song that, even if Cave had succumbed to his  smack habit in the mid-80s, would nonetheless have secured his legend.  Where most post-punk/New Pop artists of the day had abandoned contrarian  values to embrace concepts of affluence and technological progress,  Cave and the Bad Seeds went about digging up the deadest of dead horses:  the blues-- a music that, at the time, was being neutered into supper-club  smoothness by the likes of Eric Clapton and Robert Cray. But if the  back-to-roots tilt of <i>The First Born Is Dead</i>-- the first product of  the band's four-year relocation to Berlin-- stands in stark contrast  to the future-minded, sample-based pop music of the era, lyrically,  ""Tupelo"" is no less a masterful mash-up, weaving a breathless yarn  from strands of the Old Testament, the birth of Elvis and John Lee Hooker's  ""Tupelo Blues"" (itself a re-imagination of the namesake city's  history, casting it as a victim of the 1927 Mississippi River flood  that, in reality, had spared it). <i>The First Born Is Dead</i> is never quite  so bold again, adopting a more familiar bluesy swing on ""Say Goodbye  to the Little Girl Tree"" and last-call piano-bar warbling on ""Knocking  on Joe"", and when Cave bellows ""I am the Black Crow King"", you're  more likely to picture one of the Lizard variety. But in the raging reappropriation of Bob Dylan's ""Wanted Man"", <i>The First Born Is  Dead</i> feels like less of a genre exercise and more a distillation of the philosophy Cave would pursue for years to come-- i.e., when  it comes to search-and-destroy deviance, punk rock's got nothing on  wild-west outlaw history, old blues songs and the Bible.</p>
<p>If the Dylan covers and Hooker references  hadn't already established Cave's old-soul aspirations, for his  next move, he opted for a strategy that most aged entertainers resort  to when trying to revive their careers three decades in, let alone three  albums: the all-covers collection. In a sense, what Cave attempted with  <i>Kicking Against the Pricks</i> (1986) was not all that different than what  any one of us do when we hit a karaoke bar: Push ourselves out of our  comfort zones and have a bit of a laugh while doing so-- certainly,  the Bad Seeds have never sounded more cheerful than in the sloshed group  sing-along of the Velvets' ""All Tomorrow's Parties"" and the  cheeky, cowpoke reading of country ballad ""Long Black Veil"". But  while stacked with murder ballads that fit right into Cave's wheelhouse -- ""Hey Joe"", Hooker's ""I'm Gonna Kill That Woman""— what's  most remarkable about the album is the amount of conviction Cave invests  in his more schmaltzy selections. Rather than subject AM radio golden-oldies  like Jimmy Webb's ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix"", Tom Jones'  ""Weeping Annaleah"", and Gene Pitney's ""Something's Gotten  a Hold of My Heart"" to contemptuous desecration, Cave sounds determined  to use them as vehicles to make him a better singer, and the Bad Seeds  a more sophisticated, stylistically diverse band.</p>
<p>Their next album would yield the real  fruits of the <i>Pricks</i> experiment: <i>Your Funeral... My Trial</i> (1986) showcases  Cave and the Bad Seeds' various modes and models with peak-form precision,  building up from the elegantly wasted reveries (""Sad Waters"", ""Stranger  Than Kindess""), creepy cabaret set pieces (""The Carny"") and exquisite  murder balladry (the title track) of the album's first act before  erupting into the show-stopping, whip-cracking surges (""Jack's Shadow"", ""She Fell Away"", a definitive cover of Tim Rose's ""Long Time  Man"") of the second. Every guise Nick Cave would assume from hereon  in-- from the dignified piano balladeer of 1990's <i>The Good Son</i> to  the mad preacher of 2004's <i>Abattoir Blues</i>-- can be traced back here;  indeed, even Grinderman's unhinged ""No Pussy Blues"" seems a touch  less feral once you get reacquainted with the blasphemous depravity  of <i>Your Funeral</i>'s ""Hard on for Love"", which intensifies its libidinous  thrust into rabid bloodlust and then abruptly cuts out when Cave hits  his frothy-mouthed fever pitch.</p>
<p>The Bad Seeds' final Berlin-based  recording-- 1988's <i>Tender Prey</i>, featuring certified Cave classics  ""The Mercy Seat"" and ""Deanna""-- is not a part of this initial  remaster series, presumably so Mute could reissue the band's eight  releases for the label in even blocks of four. However, its exclusion  also underscores the notion that <i>Your Funeral... My Tria</i><i>l</i> represents  the true apotheosis of the Bad Seeds, drawing from the strengths of  its three quite different predecessors-- the horror-film atmosphere  <i>of From Her to Eternity</i>, the apocalyptic oration of <i>The First Born Is  Dead</i>, the velvet-jacket suavity  of <i>Kicking Against the Pricks</i>-- into a superbly structured, singular work. Every bruised romantic  to emerge in its wake-- from PJ Harvey to the Tindersticks, Mark Lanegan  to the National-- owes it a tip of the syringe.</p>
<p>The timeless quality of Cave's songwriting  sources, and the live-in-the-room ethos employed by producer Flood mean  that these albums have aged infinitely better than most bands' mid-80s  output, bearing none of the technical sheen, studio gimmickry and drum  compression that dates so many records of the era. But these remasters  are still worthy additions for both long-time enthusiasts and recent,  post-Grinderman recruits. On top of revising the tracklists to their  original vinyl running orders (the old North American CD versions bizarrely  interspersed B-sides into the flow mid-album), the new mixes render  the Bad Seeds' <i>mise en scenes</i> even more nightmarishly vivid-- on  <i>From Her to Eternity</i>'s chain-gang howl ""Well of Misery"", Harvey's  percussive hits really do sound like hammers hitting rock, while the  multi-tracked madness of <i>Your Funeral</i>'s ""The Carny"" is about as  close as you'll get to having Cave read you a scary bedtime story  in your room.</p>
<p>The four issues are sold separately but,  in a clever gambit to make you buy all four, the discs are each appended  with sequential portions of Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard's accompanying  DVD documentary, titled <i>Do You Love Me</i>. The films are strikingly simple,  comprised entirely of uniformly barren, head-shot interviews with members  of the Bad Seeds (Bargeld, Adamson), their peers (Go-Between Robert  Vickers, former Birthday Party guitarist Roland S. Howard), celebrity  admirers (Moby, Depeche Mode's Dave Gahan, Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner), critics (Simon Reynolds) as  well as regular fans, including, most memorably, a stripper from L.A.  who-- at height of Guns N Roses' late-80s peeler-bar dominance-- insisted on dancing to Cave's version of ""By the Time I Get  to Phoenix"". But beyond the revelatory anecdotes about each album's  recording-- heck, I could watch Blixa Bargeld read out <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-J4FXp5g2Q"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">department-store  catalogues</a>-- the documentaries show that, for all of his songs' grandiose theatricality,  Cave's music affects his fans (famous and otherwise) on the same deeply  personal, intimate level. Fittingly, pretty much the only principal  not interviewed about Cave is Cave himself-- because, like their subject,  the filmmakers respect the distance between those who tell the myth  and those who make it.</p></div>"|12949.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12949-from-her-to-eternity-the-first-born-is-dead-kicking-against-the-pricks-your-funeral-my-trial/|9.4|Stuart Berman

But the band's heartbeat is that of Finn Andrews, a globetrotting goth  troubadour from a rock'n'roll lineage (he is the spawn of XTC's  Barry, though it seems unfair to mention it since his talent far outstrips  others of similar parentage). Not only is Andrews the primary songwriter,  frontman, and face of the band (that was his portrait on the cover of  2007's <i>Nux Vomica</i>), but with the group's often spare arrangements  and bluesy, sandpapery melodies, it is his keening voice that gives  the Veils their emotional wallop.</p>
<p>It's a voice that splits the difference  between the earnest, reedy wanting of a young, be-mulleted Bono and  the anxious bleat of ""Paranoid Android""-era Thom Yorke. Many have  used Jeff Buckley as a comparison, but that misses Andrews' best feature.  While Buckley's falsetto was so emotive that it could bleed a Leonard  Cohen song of its darkness, carving a path for teary <i>American Idol</i> performances, Andrews has a dryness to his delivery, taking what could  be poignant and churning it around in his mouth until it comes out wry  or arch. It sounds akin to many of rock's greatest voices, but ultimately,  because his tongue is often planted far inside his cheek, the final  effect is unique, so when he does give in to a moment of sincerity,  listeners feel the weight.</p>
<p>Though <i>Sun Gangs</i>, Veils'  third full-length and second with their current lineup, is missing the  spleen that surged throughout <i>Nux Vomica</i>, it offers plenty of  other drama for Andrews to vocally interpret. He claims that it's  a break-up record, and the lyrics on the surprisingly delicate title track seem to confirm it, even if few of the other tracks  are explicitly about romantic loss. For the first time, however, Andrews  seems comfortable giving in to the expressive power of his voice. And so the songs with the most earnestly sung, majestic  melodies-- like the Bernard Butler-produced, piano-led opener ""Sit  Down By the Fire""-- are among the collection's best.</p>
<p><i>Sun Gangs</i> is, unmistakably, an  emotional journey, though not always a pleasant one. ""Three Sisters""  and ""The Letter"" offer proof that Andrews is enamored with fellow  Antipodean Nick Cave, though not having 30 years of experience like  his hero, the tunes start to feel forgettable and overly repetitious  in the context of the album. And ""Larkspur"", <i>Sun Gang</i>'s  emotional centerpiece, is especially difficult to listen to, especially given its  more than eight-and-a-half-minute run time. Depending on your mood,  it can sound like the purposefully disorienting soundtrack to a nervous  breakdown or, with its build and repeated ""I pull his hands from the  earth"" mantra, a modern update of the Doors' garbled theatrics of  ""The End"". But there is still something compelling about its unpleasantness, how it  is so naked and unafraid of being ugly. And fortunately,  it comes just two songs after ""The House She Lived In"", <i>Sun Gangs</i>'  melodic showstopper. With a vintage vibe and charming lyrics that rhyme  ""remember"" with ""December"" against the familiar insistence of  doo-wop piano chords, the track's pop charm remains as an aftertaste  long enough for listeners to muddle through ""Larkspur""'s often  cruel ambiance.</p>
<p>Perhaps, then, <i>Sun Gangs</i> is less  a break-up record, and more a ""relationship"" record, in that it  has the ups and downs of a love affair, with moments of joy, boredom,  and viciousness sandwiched in closely next to each other. And while  that makes for a challenging and complex listen-- Andrews has certainly  proved to be adept at wringing bitterness or misanthropy from bruised  melodies-- one can't help but hope that his next relationship is a  happy one. For <i>Sun Gangs</i>' biggest surprise is that Andrews  sounds lovely sounding lovely.</p></div>"|12955.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12955-sun-gangs/|6.7|Rebecca Raber

As such, her last two records were clear cases of diminishing returns-- <i>Fatherfucker</i> seemed lazy and rushed; <i>Impeach My Bush</i> was better, but inconsistent in its inspiration. Both albums expanded upon the gleefully pervy, button-pushing persona established on <i>The Teaches of Peaches</i>, but broke little ground in their own right, and mostly presented a more extreme and gratingly puerile variation on her brand of sexually confrontational performance art. This was unfortunate, as the raw power of songs like ""Fuck the Pain Away"" and ""Lovertits"" came just as much from their bawdiness as their well-crafted tunefulness and expression of complicated, conflicted emotions. As she drifted toward intellectualized vulgarity, she lost touch with the wounded humanity that made <i>The Teaches of Peaches</i> so engaging. <i>I Feel Cream</i> finds Peaches reversing that trend, and reconnecting with the muse that produced her early classics. At the same time, its songs point in new directions for her aesthetic and offer her a future beyond endless retreads on a tired formula.</p>
<p>Though it feels strange to describe an album with such unapologetically filthy lyrics as ""mature,"" the word certainly applies here, and not just in the way Peaches foregrounds and embraces her advancing age in many of the songs. Several tracks delve deep into what Stephen Malkmus might refer to as ""real emotional trash,"" and allow her to reveal a vulnerability that had only been hinted at on previous efforts. ""Talk To Me"", one of the best songs of Peaches' career to date, has her confronting problems with a partner head-on without pulling any punches, and singing her heart out with the aggrieved intensity of Tina Turner. ""Lose You"", the atypically ethereal track that follows in the sequence, flips the mood with her voice taking on a demure affect as she frets about driving her lover away over a low key yet bass-heavy groove. Both cuts cast aside the baggage of the Peaches persona and are better for it, and the variation in vocal technique broadens the range of the record considerably.</p>
<p>When Peaches returns to her default position of sexually explicit rapping, her performances are more focused and gracefully composed than in the past, perhaps a direct result of the superior quality beats provided by guest producers Simian Mobile Disco and Digitalism. ""Billionaire"", the record's most overtly hip-hop oriented track, is a genuine banger with rhymes recalling Beck circa <i>Midnite Vultures</i>, and stands out as another all-time high in the Peaches songbook. The remainder of the selections favor a more European approach to keyboard tones and dance beats, which in turn brings her deeper into a modern club sound beyond her origins in electroclash. Intriguingly, the record's final quarter slips into a woozy, down-tempo minimalism that feels sexy as opposed to sexual, and comes across like an update on the freakishly calm funkiness of Missy Elliott and Timbaland's early-00s collaborations.</p>
<p>Depsite the number of collaborators on board for <i>I Feel Cream</i>-- Gonzalez, Soulwax, and Drums of Death also contribute-- Peaches still produced the lion's share of the album on her own, and her sensibility as a musician has clearly evolved along with her approach to lyrics. Ultimately, even when she veers into previously unexplored aesthetic territory, every track feels just like Peaches, which is rather remarkable given how rigid and predictable she had been in the recent past. Whereas it was beginning to seem that Peaches' shtick was an artistic dead end, there is now plenty of reason to believe that she may have the skills and vision necessary to produce interesting, emotionally affecting work well beyond menopause.</p></div>"|13003.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13003-i-feel-cream/|7.3|Matthew Perpetua

During the mid-1990s she formed Retsin, a folk-pop duo with the multi-instrumentalist and poet Cynthia Nelson. Then came <i>The Sonora Pine</i>, where she got her experimental chops in collaboration with former Lungfish guitarist Sean Meadows. This was later followed by a stint in the fantastic progressive metal trio the King Cobra, and her relocation to Portland, where she is now based. In addition to her continuously productive solo career which began with the 2000 full-length <i>Peregrine</i>, O'Neil is also a notable artist who's work has been published in two profoundly lovely books of paintings, <i>Who Takes a Feather</i> [Map] and<i> Wings. Strings. Meridians: A Blighted Bestiary</i> [Yeti].</p>
<p><i>A Ways Away</i>, O'Neil's fifth solo album and first on the K imprint, draws together her considerable experience as a producer, singer, and songwriter in a fleetingly beautiful 36 minutes that washes over the listener in an introspective haze. There's a characteristic tone that runs through all of her albums-- an elastic guitar reverb that stretches to give a delicate puff to her songs, drums that rarely go beyond a gentle grounding pitter-patter and, of course, the haunting lull of her voice, which beckons the listener into her world with mellow grace. Strings make a valuable appearance on <i>A Ways Away</i>, bringing a sharp sweetness to a song like ""In Tall Grass"" as she layers and harmonizes over her main vocal track. O'Neil also includes a slightly reworked version of ""Howl"", one of the standout songs on her 2004 album, <i>You Sound, Reflect</i>. It benefits from a more powerful but just as moving performance, as the focus is brought to her voice instead of heavy instrumentation and therefore feels right at home among her new material.</p>
<p>Since O'Neil is just as open to collaboration on recordings as she notoriously is with her live shows, she rounded up Jana Hunter, violinist Jean Cook, members of Ida, and Osa Atoe of New Bloods for contributions to <i>A Ways Away</i>. Their marks are pleasingly evident here and there, but never derail O'Neil's vision for the album, which moves from a glistening guitar solo on ""Pearl Into Sand"" to an explosive drone on ""The Drowning Electric"", bringing our attention back to her understated and intriguing talents as a guitarist with an extraordinary attention to detail that both soothes and surprises.</p></div>"|12987.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12987-a-ways-away/|7.8|Mia Clarke

The Shortwave Set don't care about practical questions such as this, of course-- they're fine with their LP title being a fancy, six-syllable way to say ""lamp."" A second question arises, then: Why make things so unnecessarily complicated, and then be coy about it? It's semantics, sure, but also a useful way to think about the group and their latest album. <i>Replica Sun Machine</i> is an exceedingly simple thing-- with tunes so familiar-feeling to be easily ignorable-- but it's presented with a false sense of intricacy, gussied up and disguised as something more than it really is. Now, the important question: Is it any wonder that Danger Mouse signed on to produce it?</span></p>
<p>The Shortwave Set and Danger Mouse have a lot in common: They're both highly competent at what they do-- artfully, but not flashily, recombining recognizable music and cultural signifiers into pleasing new shapes. And like the technologies that the Set are enamored of, when they do their jobs really well, they just disappear. Take ""Now 'til '69"", for example, which operates in the same careful nostalgic register as a PT Cruiser, right down to its last ""be bop a lula"" and Jerry Lee Lewis piano pound. It sounds positively huge and incredibly clean, like a well-funded local theater putting on a ""rock'n'roll"" revue, and that's the prevailing tone of the album: Everything feels factory-stamped, looked over by Inspector #22, and mostly bereft of any humanity whatsoever. There's a reason that ""Glitches 'N' Bugs"" sounds so nostalgic, after all: Those things are ironed out well in advance of the shipping date.</p>
<p>And that's the rub with <i>Replica</i>. The Shortwave Set fetishize the leftovers of 20th century consumer culture, but while adopting the same generic approach toward musical style. The waltz-time refrain from ""Distant Daze"", surrounded by lustrous piano, fuzzed-out guitars and 1950s sci-fi sound effects, could be the Set's ""Statement of Principles"", tacked to the bulletin board next to their assembly line: ""Long lost distant days/ I don't quite remember you."" ""House of Lies"" could pass for lost late 60s John Lennon demos, unearthed and Martinized into a new shape. And let's face it: opening track ""Harmonia"" sounds like whatever Jeff Lynne did to ""Free as a Bird"" for the <i>Beatles Anthology</i>. <span>I'm not sure what other sorts of replica sun machines the Shortwave Set have produced in the past, but most of the current album is about as functional and inviting as fluorescent track lightin</span>g.</p>
<p>But what if, I thought to myself a few times while listening to <i>Replica</i>, the Shortwave Set are totally in on the joke? What if the widgets they've made are self-aware, and fully cognizant that this whole thing is just a big piss-take, like the goofy promo pics Danger Mouse and Cee-Loo took to plug <i>St. Elsewhere</i>? At the least, they'd sure like us to <i>think</i> they know exactly what they're doing, or so they carefully telegraph on ""I Know"": ""We make our music always off-key/ It's twisted and it's wrong, some kind of junk symphony."" But don't be fooled: Like the careful shopper at the antique store, if you scrape the paint with your thumbnail, you'll find an Oster logo underneath.</p></div>"|13005.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13005-replica-sun-machine/|3.5|Eric Harvey

She's clearly not oblivious to her disarming qualities. On the covers of both her albums, her wide eyes and porcelain features give her the appearance of a cartoon princess come to life, and in the songs contained therein, she sings with the measured, patient tones of a benevolent, maternal authority figure. The thing that separates Clark from any number of earth mother Lilith Fair types, however, is her eagerness to subvert that effect. Her album covers may showcase her pretty face, but her blank expression and the tight framing leave the images feeling uncomfortably ambiguous. Her voice and arrangements are often mellow and soothing, but those sounds mainly serve as context as she exposes undercurrents of anxiety and discomfort hidden just beneath a gorgeous façade.</p>
<p>The songs on St. Vincent's second album, <i>Actor</i>, are primarily sung from the perspective of women who feel stifled and restless in their safe, orderly lives. Her characters worry about the judgment of neighbors and strangers, struggle with boredom and complacency, attempt to sublimate or defuse their anger, and, in one of the record's darkest selections, fantasize about disappearing completely into a new identity. Her lyrics are sympathetic observations rendered with clear, economical language focused on a specific moment of conflict or epiphany, occasionally undercut with self-deprecating asides and subtle humor. Even when the music is at its most dramatic, as when songs slip out of placid, Disney-esque string accompaniment into jagged, distorted guitar passages, Clark consistently understates her characters' angst, and buries their negative emotions under layers of denial, stoicism, and subservience to the desire of others.</p>
<p>The sound of the recordings depict the nuances of these deliberately muted emotions with uncanny accuracy, but the result is not overly polite or unaffecting. On the contrary, Clark's compositions hone in on precise fluctuations in mood, and flesh out complex inner worlds for the women suggested in her lyrics. At some points, as in the climax of ""Black Rainbow"" and the groovy, robotic hysteria of ""Marrow"", she achieves a harrowing expression of panic and desperation, but she does just as well in conveying the tension and pressures within less bombastic numbers such as ""The Bed"" and ""Save Me From What I Want"". The latter, which takes its title from one of artist Jenny Holzer's best-known aphorisms, is particularly successful in the way its faintest textural details communicate an unease at odds with its airy tone and steady beat.</p>
<p>Since Clark's voice seldom strays from a calm, lovely tone, her guitar parts articulate much of the record's anxieties and provide its moments of cathartic release. Her style is melodic and controlled, conjuring abrasive textures that nevertheless have a clean, meticulous quality that complements her immaculate arrangements as well as her characters' temperate demeanor. Despite a reliance on processed tonality, she manages to avoid a sterile coldness, and has a way of performing her most tightly composed hooks with a touch of looseness and immediacy. In her heaviest, most warped riffs, Clark finds the grace in her subjects' frustration and purges their fear and repressed anger with a glorious, singular noise.</p>
<p>In ""Actor Out of Work"", an atypically straightforward rock song early in the album's sequence, Clark uses the title phrase as a sad epithet for an inappropriate yet attractive suitor with an inability to lie convincingly. Acting, of course, is a lot more than just lying and pretending. It's about inhabiting characters, being able to fill in subtext with cadence and gesture, and having the empathy required to understand the motivations and actions of the person being portrayed. With that in mind, the album is perfectly titled, as <i>Actor</i> proves St. Vincent as an artist capable of crafting believable, complicated characters with compassion, insight, and exacting skill.</p></div>"|12985.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12985-actor/|8.5|Matthew Perpetua

In 1992, at the urging of ardent admirer Kurt Cobain, Sub Pop released <i>The Way of the Vaselines</i>, a compilation of the short-lived and then-little-known band's extant recordings (a whopping 19 tracks). Hooray for them, right? Maybe. If the Vaselines originally slotted neatly into the mid-to-late 80s Scottish shambolic pop underground of the Pastels, Shop Assistants, and BMX Bandits, their origins-- and the band's actual recordings-- became overshadowed by a single factoid: <i>They influenced Nirvana</i>. Nirvana's (good-intentioned, I'm sure) covers of ""Molly's Lips"" and ""Son of a Gun"" were more-or-less faithful, bouncy renditions, but they lacked the humor, menace, and complexity of the naïvely played, ambivalently sung originals. And ""Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam"" has long been associated with Nirvana's funereal <i>MTV Unplugged</i> performance, during which Cobain caressed the sweetly sacrilegious song with the reverence due a cultural relic-- something it neither wanted nor deserved.</p>
<p>Sub Pop's new <i>Enter the Vaselines</i> 2xCD set of remastered originals and unreleased demos and live tracks gives listeners, now adequately distanced from Cobain's influence, an opportunity to reevaluate the band on its own terms. In his liner notes, journalist and eternal scenester Everett True, batting around words like ""sordidness"" and ""depravity"" and painting core duo Eugene Kelly and Frances McKee as subversive artistes, probably overcorrects the Vaselines story. The slipcase's cover photo, featuring a glowering McKee and listless, stoned-looking Kelly, does an ace job of reinforcing this view, even as the set's musical contents tell a different tale.</p>
<p>As the former romantic couple has repeatedly asserted in interviews (including one conducted for inclusion in the set by Pastel Stephen McRobbie), the band was originally a lark, and many of their songs were written for a laugh by horny but essentially pretty wholesome kids with time on their hands. Early tracks-- ""Rory Rides Me Raw"", with its charmingly awful double entendres, and Divine cover ""You Think You're a Man"" with its juvenile, erm, climactic ending-- succinctly make that case. (They never abandoned the sexually provocative, however, going on to record songs like ""Monsterpussy"" and ""The Day I Was a Horse"".)</p>
<p>The Vaselines became a little more accomplished and professional over the course of their short run, ditching their drum machine for flesh-and-blood bandmates and investing greater effort, including actual guitar solos and orchestral arrangements (okay, ""Sunbeam"" has a viola), into their second EP, <i>Dying for It</i>, and only full-length, <i>Dum-Dum</i>. But as this career survey suggests, the band was at its best when they were at their worst, when they sounded like rank amateurs in the throes of DIY fever-- not to mention, love. Kelly and McKee's chemistry, their playful vocal trade-offs, and flirtatious innuendo are what make a song like ""Gun"" something more than anonymous C86 ephemera. And make them hard to cover well.</p>
<p>With their dirty mouths and pretty faces, pop perspicacity and knack for making a bloody racket, there's no question the Vaselines were worth rescuing from obscurity. And now that the original duo is touring for the first time in 20 years-- without any new product-- Sub Pop's compilation redux is, from a marketing perspective, understandable. Whether fans who already own the first Sub Pop compilation (which is still in print and less expensive) need to cough up cash for this second release isn't as clear. The 17-track bonus disc is fun to hear, particularly the demos for the unreleased ""Rosary Job"" and ""Red Poppy"", but it's hardly a game-changer. And considering the Vaselines' studio recordings were almost as fuzzy and slipshod as their demos and live tracks, the audio fidelity upgrade, while nice to have, probably won't sway the lo-fi-loving hardcores, nor should it.</p></div>"|12989.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12989-enter-the-vaselines/|8.0|Amy Granzin

The Swedish duo, comprising vocalist Mariam Wallentin and her husband, percussionist Andreas Werliin, have taken this unadorned method to a remarkable level on their follow up album, <i>The Snake</i>. <i>Heartcore</i> may have shone with clarity and technical artfulness, but in the passing year Wildbirds &amp; Peacedrums have honed their skills to such a fine degree that their distinctive sound is now fully realized and acutely powerful.</p>
<p><i>The Snake</i> is a considerably darker album compared to the tender playfulness of their debut, and this smoky sultriness suits the music well. Just as the number of cuts on a diamond determine its brightness, Wildbirds &amp; Peacedrums seem to have absorbed a huge range of musical resources-- from American primitive to jazz to Björkesque experimentalism and even Mongolian throat singing-- and mined them carefully before whittling down the essentials and fashioning 10 beautifully imaginative, contemplative songs.</p>
<p><i>The Snake</i> comes alive through its imagery, which provides the life source for the instrumentation to be structured around. The opening track, ""Island"", recalls the journey of a solitary man who swims to Iceland under a canopy of rainbows, and on ""Chain of Steel"", Wallentin struggles to free herself from the emotional clutches of a female foe. All this deft wordplay makes for some fantastic lyrics, but the real magic lies in their execution. Wallentin hops and skips across her vocal landscape with full control and arresting finesse, demanding that you listen intently to her abstract storytelling. On a track such as ""So Soft So Pink"" she travels between vocal styles fluidly, from the aforementioned throat singing that blends in with the springy rasp of a Jew's harp before sliding in to soaring, ethereal melodies as she constantly alters her technique to enable the song to expand. It's barely six minutes long, but it feels epic. The way her soulful vocals maneuver across Werliin's percussive background recalls the dark beauty of Nina Simone's ""Be My Husband"" or Odetta's ""Another Man Done Gone"", which are all the more compelling for the warmth and passion that knot around the skeletal simplicity of the music. Werliin's sharpness and dexterity is the key to making this work: His rhythmic sophistication is the group's vital glue, and each member depends on the other to reach their full potential. As Wallentin sings on the final track, ""My Heart"", ""I'm lost without your rhythm.""</p>
<p>Despite their strong pop leanings, its not surprising that Wildbirds &amp; Peacedrums were awarded Swedish Jazz Act of the Year in 2008. Their equipment may be largely restricted to percussion, vocals, and the occasional embellishment of keyboard, but their ability to fully eclipse these limitations and create music with a strong improvisational pulse and so much vitality is a no small feat, and proves that they are continuing to experiment in magnificent, dynamic ways.</p></div>"|12943.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12943-the-snake/|8.3|Mia Clarke

""I've played faggot bars, hooker bars,  motorcycle funerals... in opera houses, concert halls, halfway houses.""  Not sure where opening up for Animal Collective in Chicago this past  January ranks on that list, but it's a safe bet his booking agent  has a bit more pull these days. The once-obscure Detroit singer-songwriter  is enjoying a reissue-fueled second chapter in his career-- third,  if you count his cult status in Australia and South Africa-- and is  finally receiving critical reception a few decades after the fact. Not  bad for someone once billed under the silly pseudonym Rod Riguez because  a producer/label owner ""didn't want to take a chance"" that his  artist would be pigeonholed by the public.</p>
<p>A big part of his appeal is  his urban poet-style social observations, frank lyrics laid bluntly  over folk-rock strumming, funky riffs, and intriguing instrumentation. <i> Coming From Reality</i>, originally released in 1971 and the follow-up  to <i>Cold Fact</i>, loses some of the grittiness and directness of  his debut, never striking the same balance of eclectic arrangements,  reverb-heavy vocals and flourishes achieved while working with the production  team of Detroit vets Dennis Coffey and Mike Theodore. Washed out a bit  by soft, sometimes airy strings and lacking a killer single like the  drug dealer-themed ""Sugar Man"", it doesn't hit quite as hard.  But it's a decent addition to the singer's relatively scant output.</p>
<p>Recorded in London with producer  Steve Rowland, a former Hollywood actor who would later discover and  sign the Cure, <i>Coming From Reality</i> suffered from the change in  studio and scenery. Opener ""Climb Up on My Music"" is a mellow, organ-heavy  Steppenwolf/Santana jam with a screaming guitar riff and ""Halfway  Up the Stairs"" exudes a sweet, cheesy 70s soft rock vibe. Rodriguez  still delivers some pointed observations on tracks like ""Street Boy"",  one of a trio of solid bonus cuts recorded in 1972-1973 with Coffey  and Theodore, and ""A Most Disgusting Song"", a droll, overly long  country-tinged narration told from the vantage point of a dive bar.  But they're thinned out by songs like ""It Started Out So Nice"",  a string-laden tale filled with some obscure myth-like references, and  ""Heikki's Suburbia Bus Tour"", a rip on suburban life with an awkward  chorus and a tired dig on lawn care. On the plaintive ""I  Think of You"", his voice leans too much towards James Taylor softness,  and lyrics like ""Baby I ain't joking/ And it's not what I'm  smoking/ But I really think you're nice"" from ""Silver Words?""  which sounds like a tired Seth Rogen come-on, are a bit weak. When Rodriguez's  pastiche of styles coalesces, the music occupies an interesting niche  at the crossroads of late-60s/early-70s music. But the second  trip to the archives is a case of diminishing returns.</p></div>"|12994.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12994-coming-from-reality/|6.1|Patrick Sisson

Power lines wilt, trees teeter, telephone poles tilt, and chunks of broken down buildings spill onto the sidewalks. But has the rainbow beam come to the rescue, or is it responsible for the destruction? No doubt the Shakes, with their brand of today's fashionable guitar pop sounds-- a fusion of folk, global-pop, and good ol' fashioned indie rock-- mean to project the former interpretation. The music exudes a kind of clear-eyed optimism that can only come from seeing the worst but looking forward to the best, and indeed the band has acknowledged hearkening back to the hearty, happy (or at least happier) days of the early 1990s, not in terms of the music but in terms of the national everything-is-still-possible mood.</p>
<p>On the other hand, anyone put off by the group's privileged nostalgia and self-consciously upbeat lyrics might imagine the cover's rainbow canopy as a multi-hued harbinger of doom, announcing yet another smug Brooklyn band with a savvy appreciation of someone's big brother's hip record collection and a smart way of appropriating and assimilating it into a catchy enough but far from guileless confection. Surely it takes some degree of suspension of disbelief to buy ""Sunlight"", the band's doe-eyed tribute to having a good time, draped as it is with bright keyboards and horns, or ""Strictly Game"", which bounces along bubbling synths and Afro-Caribbean rhythms, singer Lexy Benaim declaring hopefully, in his thin, nasally but affable voice, ""this will be a better year.""</p>
<p>Indeed, were Benaim a stronger singer, he might better understand the importance of serving a little darkness with your light, some subtle irony undercutting the earnestness. But no, he and the Shakes don't even attempt the balancing act and instead stress the pep, which is probably for the best, since an act with any less conviction that the bright way is the right way would have a hard time pulling off the likes of ""Unhurried Hearts (Passaic Pastoral)""-- let alone its title-- or ""Natural Man"", each a broad compression of the recent indie-timeline beginning somewhere around Clap Your Hands Say Yeah and ending more or less contemporaneously with Vampire Weekend.</p>
<p>Fortunately, even if the band's lack of cynicism often veers to the opposite extreme, the Harlem Shakes' handshake-and-smile approach is hard to outright dislike. The Harlem Shakes have their eyes on the prize, and it's sort of charming imagining the group riding that rainbow to the rescue (and greater fame) as self-appointed countermeasures to the menace of malaise. Sunny proselytizers that that they are, the Shakes no doubt see every frown and rain cloud as mere challenges to surmount until the masses are basking in their collective light, but on their door-to-door home-invasion quest they should expect more than a few grouchy ""no solicitors"" postings. This one included.</p></div>"|12999.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12999-technicolor-health/|5.0|Joshua Klein

It's not just that his work as Bright Eyes has essentially always been a solo vision, but that he felt the need to name it ""Bright Eyes"" in the first place, using a collective <i>nom de plume,</i> in the process adding an extra level of presumptive self-sustaining wholeness. More to the point, there's Oberst's artistic persona itself-- his aggrieved yelp, his poetic bloodletting, his political hectoring, and his perpetual navel gaze, which have combined to attract admirers and detractors with equal fervency.</p>
<p>To date, there's not been a whole lot of room for anyone else in Bright Eyes' music, both in the way Oberst sang and in the first-person singular pronouns that so automatically rolled off his tongue. Then came last year's eponymous release under Oberst's actual legal name, and irony of ironies, it turned out to be the most self-effacing, song-driven work of his entire career. Oberst made the album with a newly assembled cadre of players dubbed the Mystic Valley Band, yet it was still solely his name and mug on the cover and almost exclusively his voice and songs on the CD. Which is why it's still hard not to do a double-take upon viewing the credits for <i>Outer South</i>, already tellingly released under the banner of Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band, and seeing that a full seven of the album's 16 songs aren't sung by indie-rock's former enfant terrible, and that six of those seven weren't penned by him either.</p>
<p>However, Oberst hasn't displayed any modesty within the songs he did write and sing. A full subsuming of Oberst's personality would severely dilute his music's power, but <i>Outer South</i> seems to actually undo many of the beneficially humbling gains made by his last record. Unquestionably, there are dazzlers here, foremost the ripping power-popper ""Cabbage Town"" and the equally pleasing, jangly ""Spoiled"", which cannily evokes the ramshackle charm of 1980s R.E.M. and the Cure. Another plus, ""To All the Lights in the Windows"" gets over on a facile, open-hearted refrain in spite of Oberst's lyrical attempts to bite off more history and myth than he can chew.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that last qualifier also applies to a few of Oberst's other efforts on <i>Outer South</i>. First single ""Nikorette"" finds him engaged in one of his regrettably favorite sports-- passing self-satisfied judgments on his fellow man, pronouncing, ""There's nothing sadder than a lynching mob/ Full of rational men who believe in God."" ""Ten Women"" and ""White Shoes"" are stultifyingly ponderous, and of Oberst's songs of sober fervor only ""Roosevelt Room"" hits its mark, with Oberst remembering his great Desaparecidos trick of replacing Deep Thoughts with pure bile, flashing admirable oppositional rancor at a time when lots of his left-leaning friends are lining up to kiss Obama's hem. Of course, then ""I Found a Reason #2"" arrives and we have to deal with Oberst eating up the old 60s tropes all over again, from evoking <i>Rolling Stone </i>to nakedly aspiring to be the next Dylan, pealing organs and all.</p>
<p>And remember, these things are taking place on an album that features songwriting and singing contributions from people not named Conor Oberst. As you might expect, Oberst's reversion to logorrhea and emotional extremism here effectively eliminates the possibility that <i>Outer South</i> will possess any ensemble cohesion. There aren't too many personalities with the panache to butt into Oberst's spotlight, and yet his co-conspirators here seem inherently milquetoast-y regardless of context. Jason Boesel (""Difference Is Time"", ""Eagle on a Pole"") does boast a pleasantly dusky, Matt Berninger-ish croon, but Nik Freitas and especially Taylor Hollingsworth only have reedy nice-boy whines to lend to their tunes. Perhaps it's partly a factor of Oberst's essential attention-grabbing nature, but none of these gentlemen offers up a composition that snags the ear better than the most mundane effort from their fearless leader. Perhaps it's simply the case that Oberst is on a busman's holiday here, but either he failed to get the memo to keep things light, or else he should have recruited some more substantial Wilburys.</p></div>"|12992.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12992-outer-south/|4.9|Joshua Love

The horn section, once the thundering heart of the  band, took on a different role, settling into spaced-out dialogue with  the rhythms-- leader Elliot Bergman's more conversational horn charts  recalled Charles Mingus and Sun Ra in their perfectly pitched balance  between structure and disorder. <i>Invisible Cities</i> serves as something  of a breath-catching moment for a band that's taken a giant leap on  each of its albums, bringing some of the thunder back while further  elaborating on the progress made on <i>Ghost Rock</i>.</p>
<p>Bergman's scrap metal instrument  collection continues to grow-- this time, he's made a musical contraption  out of street sweeper tines to deepen the band's gamelan-ish percussion  patterns even further. The band also pays tribute to one of the 20th century's great instrument inventors, Moondog, by covering his German-period  composition ""Bumbo"", a perfect fit for NOMO's mix of complex rhythm,  homemade sounds, and arrangements that allow individual horns a chance  to break out of the group. They add wordless female voices to the mix on the weird, rambling ""Ma"", giving the song a striking  avant-exotica sound as the nagging guitar part chafes at the snaking  baritone sax line.</p>
<p>Amid cosmic freakouts like  the echoing rocket ride ""Banners on High"" and oozing slow-burns  like the smeared half-free/half-composed ""Elijah"", NOMO bring  out a few big, crunching horn themes that  recall their early, Afrobeat-inspired music. The title track is  a total bomb, with the electric likembes providing a bubbling harmonic  bed for the horns to lie on over the fractured drum beat. ""Waiting""  is a classic funk workout with fluid sax parts and a few wicked sections  where the horns solo against each other, while ""Patterns"" rides  a swamp vamp the Meters would've loved to call their own.</p>
<p><i>Invisible Cities</i> is  the exact record NOMO needed to make at the point in their evolution.  It consolidates all their gains and nicely sums up their output to this  point, and as much as you can point to influences and basic kinship  with other artists, the music NOMO are now making is very much their  own thing. NOMO's facility with both rhythm and tunefulness also makes it easy to follow them as they head down their own path. If you've come this far with the group, <i>Invisible Cities</i> won't disappoint, and it's also a pretty great place to start.</p></div>"|12945.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12945-invisible-cities/|8.0|Joe Tangari

There was something  exciting to me about rolling the dice on a band after simply connecting  with their visual aesthetic. Of course, that kind of mystery doesn't  exist anymore-- we could feasibly know loads about a group before hearing  a note of their music-- but if it did, I think I would take one look  at the hand-drawn purple bat and rainbow adorning Thee Oh Sees' <i> Help</i> and just <i>know</i> it was going to be rad. And I would be  right.</p>
<p>For those who haven't been  following John Dwyer's various costume changes over the years, Thee  Oh Sees are an extension of the San Francisco-based rocker's work  as OCS, a lo-fi solo folk project he started after heading up (among  others) the raucous noise and garage acts Pink and Brown and Coachwhips.  Over time the band's expanded into a four-piece, and Dwyer's used  it as a means to explore his deep love of 1960s psychedelic and garage  rock. It's also been an avenue for him to try out more conventional  pop songs with deeper accessibility-- 2008's mostly underappreciated <i> The Master's Bedroom Is Worth Spending a Night In</i> found Dwyer  at his most listenable to date.</p>
<p><i>Help</i> isn't so much  a departure from <i>Master's Bedroom</i> but a refinement of what  Thee Oh Sees accomplished on that record. Their approach is the same-- a combination of the Cramps' zombie rockabilly with the rumble  of the 60s underground-- but everything about this album is tighter  and more focused. Gone are the detours into funereal dirges, the patches  of spaz-noise, and the momentary freakouts. Here you've got just 12 very good rock songs without an ounce of fat on them. Perhaps more remarkable  is that, in this effort to streamline, Thee Oh Sees haven't lost their  signature volatility-- <i>Help</i> still seems like it could careen  off the rails at any moment (a good thing).</p>
<p>With an album this retro-minded,  there's a desire to pick apart all its myriad influences, and indeed,  I could spend my entire word count investigating nods to the Small Faces,  13th Floor Elevators, the Troggs, and others, but that would be missing  the point. The important thing here is that Thee Oh Sees incorporate  the oft-referenced <i>Nuggets</i> stuff in a way that feels reverential.  With grinding guitars and bah-bah-bah vocals, tracks like ""Meat Step  Lively"" and ""Go Meet the Seed"" owe everything to this style, but  with the punk and new-wave elements also at play, they don't feel  trite or plagiarized. Even if they did, these guys sound so much more  authentic than almost anyone else doing this kind of thing that one wonders  if it would matter.</p>
<p>As he did on <i>Master's  Bedroom</i>, Dwyer splits vocal duties here with bandmate Brigid Dawson  and it's this one-two punch that really makes the record sing. On  devilish stompers ""Destroyed Fortress Reappears"" and ""Ruby Go Home"", her  soft croon cuts the acidity of Dwyer's yelp and lends the tracks buoyancy.  It's a give-and-take not unlike the Mamas and the Papas' or the  B-52s', and even though the band is the first to point out they  don't sound like the latter, the comparison is apt. The male/female  vocal interplay bleeds into <i>Help</i>'s slower tracks and works  there, too. Dwyer and Dawson meet in the chorus of gritty love ballad  ""A Flag in the Court"" and beautifully double-track the brooding,  dirty groove of ""Can You See?""</p>
<p>These tracks and other winners  such as ""Rainbow"" and ""Soda St. #1"" comprise an album that's  virtually mistake-free. It's hard to pick out a song, or even aspects  of a song, that don't work within the overall context of the record.  That's not to say that everyone will love it. In the end it's a  niche piece, and if you don't have an appreciation for the music Thee  Oh Sees are drawing upon, it's safe to say this won't be your thing.  But if you're a lifelong garage-rock purist or just enjoy the occasional  Jay Reatard track, there's a good chance you'll get a lot of mileage  out of <i>Help</i>. It's hard not to: This is like meat and potatoes  prepared by a master chef-- totally familiar but utterly delicious.</p></div>"|12981.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12981-help/|8.0|Joe Colly

The project's third album, <i>Outside Love</i>, features input from an impressive cast of indie rock staples such as Sophie Trudeau of Godspeed You! Black Emperor/A Silver Mt. Zion, the Sweet Hereafter's Jesse Sykes, Josh Stevenson of Jackie O Motherfucker, and his longtime creative collaborator, Amber Webber of Black Mountain and Lightning Dust.</p>
<p>Although Pink Mountaintops were temporarily put on the back burner after the success of Black Mountain's self-titled sophomore album in 2005, McBean resurrected the group the following year with the release of <i>Axis of Evol</i>, on which he continued to explore his deep-rooted love of dark psychedelia with minimalist rhythmic patterns and spidery, hazy, lo-fi guitar. With <i>Outside Love</i>, McBean takes this theme on an adventurous journey to surprising heights, and the fully realized sound allows his ideas more room to breathe. The granular spaciousness of the production, when paired with intentionally sloppy drums and chiming guitars, imparts an atmospheric, almost gothic feel. This works beautifully on the Mazzy Star-esque ""While You Were Dreaming"" and on the outstanding opening track, ""Axis: Thrones of Love"", which expands with lackadaisical smokiness as a rinse of reverb settles like morning mist over the male-female co-sung chorus.</p>
<p>Despite the cloudy threads that crisscross through every song, <i>Outside Love</i> throws out some supremely positive vibes. On ""Holiday"", McBean declares that everyone he knows deserves a vacation in the sun ""until the lions are off of their backs"", and ""The Gayest of Sunbeams"" is a shambolic, joyous romp built on uptempo chord shifts and group vocals that burn with enthusiasm. But it takes multiple listens to uncover the complexity of <i>Outside Love</i>; despite its deceptively simple architecture, it's grounded by rich stylistic flickering. The folky ambiance of ""And I Thank You"" could have slipped out of Bill Callahan's back catalogue, while the string section that hangs in the background of ""Vampire"" has a discreet but haunting presence, like cobwebs diffusing light through a window. This kind of agile songwriting shows that Pink Mountaintops' substance lies not only in what they show, but in what they choose to hide; here on <i>Outside Love</i>, they move between shadows and light until the form is revealed.</p></div>"|12918.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12918-outside-love/|7.3|Mia Clarke

With a title slightly more clever than <i>III</i> would have been, it's no surprise that <i>More</i> sounds pretty similar to their previous two albums, but that nuance is there; even when the band stretches out or gets their friends in on the action, it takes three or four listens to even notice what they've added.</p>
<p>For reasons that seem slightly insane, the album was recorded in an abandoned office floor in the dead of winter-- without heat-- affording the band time to fuss over the precise muffling of a bass drum or momentary squall of feedback; in short, it sounds cheap, but also full. It pays off: Even with the occasional backup vocal or surreptitious extra instrument sneaking into the mix, <i>More</i> feels looser than its predecessor (2007's <i>Ragged Rubble</i>) while being a bit more ambitious. Like everything with Double Dagger-- from their minimal setup to their thoughtful-yet-plainspoken lyrics to the graphic design-- you can tell they've thought it through a few times over.</p>
<p>Some of the album's most memorable riffs don't come until minutes into the songs, which build on themselves simply but unexpectedly. The monotonous punk screamer ""No Allies"" becomes sneakily melodic, while the placid intro of ""Vivre Sans Tempt Mort"", with clean plucking and a buzzing harmonium, leads into a blisteringly dynamic anthem, giving singer Nolen Strals time to shout about death and paranoia between the intermittent low-end crunch. Even the six-minute runtime of ""Half-Life"" hides the album's most affecting moment of cautious, weary optimism in its latter half (""maybe this year won't be like the rest,"" Strals sings).</p>
<p>These songs are squeezed for variety, from the umpteenth-notes of ""We Are the Ones"" to the straightforward shake and shimmy of ""Camouflage"", or the grinning subterranean chug of ""Surrealist Composition With Your Face"". The sober talk-sing of the verses in ""The Lie/The Truth"" is offset by the triumphant bellow of Sam Herring (of Future Islands) on the chorus; his contribution is slight but essential. Being neither a ""new"" lo-fi act nor a day-glo Wham City band (but able to hang with either), while staying politically aware and personally grounded in their lyrics, Double Dagger once again prove there are fertile ideas in the narrowest slice of middle ground.</p></div>"|12960.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12960-more/|7.0|Jason Crock

Case in point: To support and celebrate this past Record Store Day, My Morning Jacket released <i>Celebración de la Ciudad Natal</i>, a double live 10"" exclusive recorded in both Louisville's indie record shop ear X-tacy as well as during a three-hour set at the city's Waterfront Park. Even the title tips its hat to the group's Kentucky stomping grounds, translating to ""celebrating the city of my birth.""</p>
<p>The music itself showcases the group in fine form, which is to be expected. Even those who grumble at their perceived fumbles will concede that My Morning Jacket remain a force to be reckoned with on stage. From the (more or less) straight Southern rock of ""Evil Urges"" to the dubious Cameo nod ""Highly Suspicious"" and the folk-country of ""Librarian"", songs from last year's <i>Evil Urges</i> benefit from the extra breathing space provided by a live airing. ""Gideon"" gets to drop some atmospherics and gain in sharpness, while fellow <i>Z</i> track ""Dondante"" is doubled in length to over 14 minutes, demonstrating the qualities that make the group such a live draw. The band also revisits ""Phone Went West"" (from <i>At Dawn</i>) and performs ""Where to Begin"", its contribution to the <i>Elizabethtown</i> soundtrack (all 10 people who caught the Cameron Crowe flop may recall it was set in Kentucky).</p>
<p>Yet <i>Celebración de la Ciudad Natal</i> is less valuable for the music than for the message it sends. ""I've been buying records at ear X-tacy since I was a tadpole,"" says Jim James on the release. ""I think the thing that people forget about is the community and the memories that are created when you come to an independent and locally owned record store that you can only get in that town."" It used to be that release day was also often the first chance you had to hear a band's new material, and divisive albums like My Morning Jacket's <i>Evil Urges</i> (released the day of the June 2008 ear X-tacy appearance) still had the power to shock and/or surprise you.</p>
<p>Sadly, for many the record store is now an afterthought, the end point after days, weeks, or even months of circulated leaks that leech each new release of its dramatic impact. It's debatable how much else has actually been lost along with those once-formative listening experiences, but certainly the sense of community James toasts has at least changed. Would My Morning Jacket have graduated to their current level without that initial surge of grassroots word-of-mouth indie support? Maybe. But one imagines the way they got there would have been quite different, and perhaps less forgiving of an upstart act finding its way forward. Consider, then, <i>Celebración de la Ciudad Natal</i> as a sort of testament to the intangible, a reminder of the long gone thrill when Record Store Day came every week.</p></div>"|12968.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12968-celebracion-de-la-ciudad-natal/|6.0|Joshua Klein

Although in the 16 years since their inception they've never made major waves outside the DIY indie community (although those waves stretched far and wide-- the band is also well-loved in the U.S. and France), they have gained a fierce following of music lovers who seem to share their passion for Orange Juice, Anna Karina, old typewriters, George Orwell, Dexys Midnight Runners, and, above all else, vinyl. Like their riot-grrrl peers (guitarist Jon Slade was a founding member of Huggy Bear), this band doesn't distinguish art from life, and has stuck to its collective passion at all costs-- namely, relative obscurity. As the photograph on the cover of <i>Broken Record Prayers</i> states, in black marker scrawled on the back of a woman's hand, ""Dreams Never End"". This is Comet Gain's motto-- a dogma that has been declared throughout the years by vocalist/guitarist David Feck, and which they act on wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>It's been four years since the release of their fifth album, <i>City Fallen Leaves</i>, so <i>Broken Record Prayers</i>, a ""collection of A- and B-sides, new songs, session tracks, and stray dogs recorded between 1998-2008"" is a timely and carefully filtered introduction to their discography. Impressively, these disparate songs flow together with bright, energetic fluency-- a difficult task for an archival project such a this. ""Young Lions"", ""Emotion Pictures"", and ""Tighten Up!"" are taken from a 1997 Peel Session, while a couple of their best tracks, ""You Can Hide Your Love Forever"" and ""Beautiful Despair"", were once available on limited vinyl only. Perhaps the most powerful of these early singles is the opening track, ""Jack Nance Hair"", which was originally released on journalist Everett True's now defunct Mei Mei label. A semi-spoken declaration of purpose, Feck takes turns with fellow vocalist Rachel Evans to comment on the importance of ""going home and listening to records with stained sleeves"" and ""getting back that fire and making your feelings known."" Its message burns with urgency: ""Believe in art/ Believe in yourself/ Contradict yourself.""</p>
<p>All Comet Gain fans know what a special band they are, but this 20-song collection, lifted from half a dozen different releases, really brings home all their accomplishments over a lengthy and productive career. As sometime member Chris Appelgren (also of The PeeChees and The Pattern) astutely comments, the band is ""messy, sweet, and tipsy."" On <i>Broken Record Prayers</i>, there are echoes of Northern Soul (""Love Without Lies""), Felt (""Books of California""), and, of course, their obsession with Orange Juice leaks between every crack. They also bring their gawky magic to covers of Curtis Mayfield's ""Hard Times"" and Dena Barnes' ""If You Ever Walk Out Of My Life"", which is wrung with sorrowful lamentations that exquisitely fit the band's self-propelled image as romantic revolutionaries.</p>
<p>One hopes that this excellent compilation will help shine a light on Comet Gain's escapades. Whether it does or not, you can be sure that the group will continue on the path they've set for themselves, recording garage pop in their London apartment, fueled by red wine and stories of heartbreak and adventure. As Evans affirms: ""Together we stand and feel stronger and braver for it/ Young, free and single/ Like the crack in the 45/ That makes the guitar snap all night/ And in the morning it starts all over again.""</p></div>"|12848.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12848-broken-record-prayers/|8.2|Mia Clarke

The songs are secondary  to Pink's bourgeoning cult of personality-- the album turns its imperfections  into selling points."" What Nick and I disagreed over (and probably  still would) is my pretty firm belief that Ariel Pink's music-- which  sounds like 1960s jangle-pop, car commercials, and gauzy 80s ballads echoing  inside a tin can-- is music whose imperfections actually <i>are</i> its selling point: Without them, it would sound like the sweatless work  of studio hacks; with them, it sounds like a horrorshow.</p>
<p>So why commend him? Because Ariel  Pink has recorded the saddest music I've heard in the past several  years. <i>But wait</i>, you're thinking, <i>I already have all these  records by the loneliest loners murmuring about the wintriest winters</i>. To which I'll say that, in singing about the wintriest winters, the  loneliest loners are fully aware of their sadness and are probably trying  to resolve it, either through the act of making art, or through the  community that their art might create. When you put a bunch of lonely  loners standing in a room together, they might just get a glimpse at  companionship.</p>
<p>Conversely, Ariel Pink takes ""perfect,""  professional music and scours its perfect professionalism so ruthlessly  that the product <i>sounds</i> solitary, disgraced, and pathetic. This  isn't the sadness of the heartbroken teenager, but of Dirk Diggler  in <i>Boogie Nights</i>: Failure that doesn't recognize itself, or a  goal debauched. If I sound high on my own poetry, take solace in the  fact that I'm writing at the tip of the iceberg for my feelings on  this music.</p>
<p>Most of the music he's released since <i> The Doldrums </i>was recorded before 2004 (a fact that felt a little  opportunistic in 2006 and a little disturbing now that it's 2009).  In a way, Nick S. turned out to be right: Ariel Pink capitalized on  his myth as a lunatic hermit by flooding the market with whatever  he had in his closet without ever having to <i>develop </i> that persona with an audience watching.</p>
<p>In light of all this, I find it riddling  and weird that the two-disc <i>Grandes Exitos</i>-- ""Greatest Hits,""  for our gringo readers-- is a tour-only release, when it could  arguably serve as one of his <i>only</i> official releases. It's a  solid and decently assembled set that highlights some of his most enchanting  pop (the nocturnal, yearning ""For Kate I Wait"", the shuffling ""Life  in L.A."", [""The weather is your boyfriend/ On a Saturday, stay in  bed""], ""Every Night I Die at Miyagis"") and some of his most  inane (""Immune To Emotion"" was funnier and more heartbreaking when  he didn't spell it out, ""Credit"" which sounds a lot like Weird  Al but probably wouldn't tickle even the most 12-year-old 12 year  old).</p>
<p>None of his CD-Rs have reached the  same highs-- lows?-- as <i>The Doldrums</i>, but they've had enough  decent material on them to make <i>Grandes Exitos</i> fully listenable  from start to finish (which I can't say about all his albums). Whether  or not you'll <i>like</i> it is something I can't predict-- Ariel  Pink, to his credit and damnation, is still a guy who most would probably  rate as an interstellar genius or bullshit artist  (or try really,  really hard to see him as a little bit of both).</p>
<p>I'm making an effort to be fair when  I say I think there's enough merit and magic on this collection or <i> The Doldrums</i> to suggest that you listen without wondering whether  he's a spoonfed art-school brat or a sniffling pothead or a mentally  fragile Californian or, very possibly, all of those things. I'm making  an effort to suggest you listen without wondering whether he ""really  means it or not,"" or, if you <i>do </i> wonder, to consider what ""it"" refers to. If you want to know if  Ariel Pink is direct, well, he's not. A half-erased, yowling song  called ""Good Kids Make Bad Grownups"" just doesn't parse as cleanly  as a rockin' song called ""Rock and Roll All Nite"". With Ariel Pink, the feeling is conveyed in the  sound that frays around him. Call him a phony if you want, but he's  a phony all his own.</p></div>"|12909.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12909-grandes-exitos/|7.0|Mike Powell

But they've carved out an impressive psych-rock niche for themselves over the course of their now 15+ year career, a niche that seems more than ever to be exclusively their own. The past several years have frequently found Bardo Pond in retrospective mode, sifting through mountains of past jams and improvisational experiments. So far they've self-released seven volumes of unearthed outtakes and rarities, and last year Three-Lobed Recordings issued <i>Batholith</i>, a potent collection of previously unreleased material.</div>
<div>
<p>Evidently the vaults have not yet been fully exhausted, for now the Bardos have teamed again with Three-Lobed to release <i>Peri</i>, a companion album to <i>Batholith </i>that contains many prized tracks that have, for one reason or another, never found a home on any of the group's proper studio albums. And though these tracks are by definition outtakes, the album is sequenced to be a cohesive listening experience in its own right, and the highlights hold their own against anything in the vast Bardo Pond back catalogue.</p>
<p>The hallmark sounds of Bardo Pond have shifted and evolved slightly over the years, but their central approach to heavy psych-rock remains fixed. Guitarist brothers Michael and John Gibbons have never liked their riffs tidied and lined up single-file, instead preferring a layered, overlapping sound that blurs every angle, leading to a heightened sense of disorientation. Another, more polarizing, constant in their sound has been vocalist Isobel Sollenberger's contributions on flute, with some of their fussier listeners judging a given track's success by the amount of flute it might or might not contain.</p>
<p>Recorded at the band's Philly headquarters during their 1996-2001 Matador era, the tracks on <i>Peri</i> showcase all of Bardo Pond's prevailing tendencies to potent effect. (Flute quotient: moderate to low.) To my ears, this collection improves upon <i>Batholith</i> largely based on the strength of the two pieces that form the LP's second side. ""Chicken Gun"", a long-time live staple, is the band at their grungiest, with the rhythm section of bassist Clint Takeda and drummer Ed Farnsworth kicking up a formidable storm while the guitarists stretch the song's riff like black taffy. Even more transporting is the closing ""Silver Pavilion"", on which Sollenberger trades flute for a ghostly viola, and the whole band displays its uncanny knack for focused yet center-less group improvisation.</p>
<p>Whatever your feelings about Sollenberger's flute, there is little denying that she remains a captivating frontwoman, even as her words are frequently submerged into the group's dark rising tides. Her dazed, narcotic vocals are the perfect vehicle when Bardo Pond want to explore their more pastoral side, as on ""The Path"", and her presence also helps gives their heavier material an ineffable human touch. Although it will be most valuable to established fans, <i>Peri </i>is an ideal complement to such vintage Bardo albums as 1997's <i>Lapsed</i> or 2001's <i>Dilate</i>, and it is a comfort to take the time to idle awhile in its enveloping glow.</p>

There's always the concurrent hope that people will be so moved, turned on, or at least intrigued by the song that they'll hunt down the tune and artist. We've all done it-- memorize a snatch of the lyrics and then either hit up Google or consult the sage minds who respond to queries at Yahoo! Answers (you might even find out how to drywall while you're at it).</p>
<p>The L.A.-based electro-rock act Great Northern (ironically a pretty Google-unfriendly moniker) make the kind of music that just happens to be perfect for selling things or setting scenes. Unsurprisingly, the band's first album performed both feats, placing songs in ads as well as on both the big and small screens-- ""Low Is a Height"" even soundtracked a couple of really awesome NBA commercials a year ago that utilized a split-screen gimmick to depict a pair of star hoopsters discussing the importance of the upcoming playoffs. The bad news is that as a roundball junkie I saw these commercials dozens of times, and yet not only was I never once inspired to track down the ad's tune, even listening to it now I can't place it in my memory in conjunction with that commercial. Meanwhile (and I know this is cheating since I already knew and loved the song), I remember somewhat embarrassingly getting a little choked up by the spot where Steve Nash was talking over Radiohead's ""House of Cards"" (ah, Stevie, will you ever get that ring?).</p>
<p>Great Northern's sophomore full-length, <i>Remind Me Where the Light Is</i>, should pick right up where the debut left off in terms of scoring network and celluloid placement, while failing to do much to actually compel people to find out just who composed those atmospheric soundscapes and gauzy melodies. The band's music is spot-on for soundtrack work precisely because it's moody yet unobtrusive, evocative of something, yet noncommittal enough to conceivably fit any emotional tableaux.</p>
<p>Thanks to vocalist Rachel Stolte, the album's more driving, insistent, and therefore most successful tracks, particularly ""Houses"", ""Story"", ""Snakes"", and ""Mountain"", approximate the sound of Madonna fronting a group of stylishly dark, beat-minded rockers from that mid-to-late 90s period when a patina of techno was seemingly <i>de rigueur</i> for would-be-hip MOR guitar acts. There are no shortage of nice touches in these songs-- ""Mountains"" is propelled by big, cascading drums while ""Snakes"" arrives on Flaming Lips-ish strings and rides an attractively loping, buzzy guitar line, yet all the major moves are pretty baldly telegraphed, and the results are eminently predictable if admittedly somewhat satisfying in their punchy loudness. The same can't be said for the tracks predominantly sung by co-principal Solon Bixler, which are more heavily distributed towards the back end of the record, and weigh it down perceptibly with purely flat dream-rock wallpaper, forgetting the saving grace of even the least interesting shoegaze band to at least crank up the damn volume. Great Northern may continue to be soundtrack heroes, but complementary aural scenery is likely all the group will ever be so long as its music can't do anything more significant than remind me how I sort of dug former Veruca Salt frontwoman Nina Gordon's first solo album.</p></div>"|12952.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12952-remind-me-where-the-light-is/|5.2|Joshua Love

He's always had an ear for the language and music of the  past, of course-- that's part of what's made him special from the get-go.  Over the course of his past few albums, though, he's been framing himself  as a one-man preservation society, the keeper of the flame for a conception  of the popular song tradition that slams shut sometime around the release  of his own first record in 1962. <i>Together Through Life</i> owes a  lot to the sound of 1950s Chicago blues, in particular, and to a few  other sorts of records it's easy to imagine Dylan playing on his ""Theme  Time Radio Hour"". It's not surprising that a deluxe version comes  with a bonus disc containing an episode of the radio show.</p>
<p>But Dylan's best records don't  just use the ten thousand glittering fragments he's found in the history  of music and literature, they transform his source material. This one  is just a pastiche of records about which he's enthusiastic, and sometimes  a blatant imitation of the kind of stuff they don't make any more. ""Jolene""  (not a Dolly Parton cover) lives down the street from Little Richard's  ""Lucille"" and Chuck Berry's ""Nadine""; ""My Wife's  Home Town"" is just a set of lazy new lyrics grafted onto the Muddy  Waters arrangement of Willie Dixon's ""I Just Want to Make Love  to You"". ""My band plays a different type of music than anybody  else plays,"" Dylan recently told <i>Rolling Stone</i>. ""As  far as I know, no one else out there plays like this. Today, yesterday,  and probably tomorrow."" This suggests that he has never heard a  moderately decent blues band in a bar. The one genuinely unprecedented  element of the band's sound is his singing voice, which at this point  is a wonder on the order of a wrecked 67 Saab that still manages to  start even though the rust has penetrated clear through to the steering  wheel.</p>
<p>Dylan tends to treat every  album as a discrete project rather than as his latest status report;  this one's parameters, besides ""I've been listening to a lot of  stuff on Chess lately and also some Tex-Mex and a little bit of Edith  Piaf,"" are the welcome presence of David Hidalgo on lead accordion  all over the place, and the somewhat more questionable presence of former  Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter, who co-wrote the lyrics of nine  of the album's 10 songs. (The other, uncredited co-lyricist, as the  overseers of Dylan's concordance have already figured out, is Geoffrey  Chaucer: Magpie Bob lifted a bunch of shiny words and phrases from David  Wright's translation of <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>.) The lyrical persona  this time alternates between old-dude-feeling-randy (""You are as  whorish as ever, baby, you could start a fire"") and old-dude-feeling-old  (""The door has closed forevermore/ If indeed there ever was a door"").  When Hunter and Dylan aren't firing off <i>bon mots</i>, though, they seem  to be aiming for the unobtrusive universality of vintage popular songs-- the  first line of the album is ""oh well I love you pretty baby.""</p>
<p><i>Together Through Life</i> isn't without its charms-- Dylan never is. It's just very minor, especially  by his standards. He's the most inconsistent of great popular musicians,  because if there's one thing he's consistently kicked against, it's  doing what anybody expects of him, including the standard late-career  decline. After <i>Time Out of Mind</i> and <i>Love and Theft</i>,  it's impossible to write him off as taking a long victory lap. But the  Dylan record <i>Together</i> is closest to in spirit isn't those, or  even <i>Desire</i> (the last time he collaborated on a full album with  another lyricist). It's the commercial-country pastiche <i>Nashville  Skyline</i>, a genre exercise that had a lot more spirit than this.  That album's capstone was ""Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You"",  a sly, lithe love song; this one's is ""It's All Good"", a prefab  boogie on which Dylan comes off like an indignant old crank grousing  about glib, optimistic whippersnappers.</p>
<p>The ultimate test of a Dylan  album, though, is to try to consider it outside the imposing context  of his career--to imagine that the bramble-voiced old dude who co-wrote  and sang these songs isn't the man who wrote <i>Highway 61 Revisited</i> and <i>Blood on the Tracks</i> and <i>Love and Theft</i>,  but Random Blues Journeyman #843. To which the reaction would have to  be: This guy's pretty OK. He's tough to take at length, but he's clever,  he's got some range, there's a funny line about Billy Joe Shaver and  James Joyce. He might have something good in him sometime. He's worth  keeping an eye on.</p></div>"|12979.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12979-together-through-life/|5.4|Douglas Wolk

Maybe that's not a dismissive phrase to your ears, especially now that track-at-a-time blog culture has turned us all into scavengers to one degree or another. But to me it's always suggested the remixes and lesser-known experiments and doodles finally deemed fit to turn a buck after every other nook and cranny of an artist's oeuvre has been exploited.</p>
<p>Said dismissal becomes even more problematic when applied to Arthur Russell, who scoffed at ""coherence"" when it came to making aesthetic connections, developing a songwriting language, maintaining career momentum, or even attributing his work. No wonder the 21st-century compilations of Russell's music-- excepting perhaps 2008's song-focused <i>Love Is Overtaking Me</i>-- have felt like grab-bags, usually in interesting ways. That said, <i>The Sleeping Bag Sessions</i> is easily the least interesting-- certainly the least revelatory-- posthumous Russell collection yet released.</p>
<p>The title-- Sleeping Bag was the record label co-owned by Russell, home to some of his most outré work <i>and</i> his most commercial-- supposedly lends the much-needed thread binding these 10 very disparate tracks. The work varies widely in quality, the tracks feel sketchily connected at best (even with the label-specific focus), and the whole thing seems thrown together. I'm not sure why we needed not one but <i>two</i> versions of ""5 Minutes"", a novelty dance cut built on samples of Ronald Reagan, except that they were until now uncollected. They're not bad, just inert, one-note agitprop gags that have failed to gain charm with nostalgic hindsight, their stuttering special effects lacking both the strangeness and pop punch of contemporaneous remix kings like the Latin Rascals. (The bassline's aged even more poorly.) And I'm also not sure if the Sounds of JHS 126 Brooklyn's ""Chill Pill"" is mildly peppy disco-rap made annoying by Russell's echo and reverb play, or forgettable old-school made slightly notable by trippy effects. Either way, it sounds slight, inessential.</p>
<p>Those are the lows. The highs are welcome but familiar, and more or less all lengthy semi-improvisations playing with traditional disco rhythms. The 12-minute Walter Gibbons mix of ""Go Bang"" pulses with percussive energy queered by dub technique, while smoothing out some of the vocal and musical eccentricities found in other mixes. The remixer even daringly ditches all extraneous stage dressing at the four-minute mark to maximize the tension of his little <i>tête-à-t</i><i>ê</i><i>te</i> between a dry bass thump, warehouse-cavernous snare crash, and gnarled, staccato guitar. Stark and loud against the negative space he's punched into Russell's previously bustling soundscape, Gibbons' drums are so tactile that a shaker's rustle can buzz right up your spine. Likewise, ""School Bell/Tree House"" does much the same for pattering hand drums, though Russell smears the mid-range with his trademark cello hum.</p>
<p>But these are well-established works of genius, for-certain cornerstones of Russell's tricky canon. The rest is padding at best, disco and downtown semi-obscurities given a profile boost thanks to Russell's late-decade burst of acclaim. The Felix collaboration with Nicky Siano is fine enough mix-fodder, but that's fainter praise than it reads considering their storming work together on ""Kiss Me Again"". It's not as if <i>The Sleeping Bag Sessions</i> is going to do some violence to Russell's quite secure rep. But neophytes are advised to let their fingers continue walking past this in the ""R"" rack until they find a copy of 2004's still-essential <i>World of Arthur Russell</i>.</p></div>"|12963.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12963-the-sleeping-bag-sessions/|6.5|Jess Harvell

January 21 marked the half-century anniversary  of Marv Johnson's ""Come to Me"", the first single on Berry Gordy's  Tamla label. Motown Record Corporation ceased to be an independent company  in 1988, when Gordy sold it for $61 million, not a bad return on the  initial $800 loan his family gave him to get started. To say it's been  an eventful 50 years is an understatement, but nothing that's happened  since 1972 can compete with the company's first 13 years in business  in terms of commercial success, cultural impact, and overall artistic  quality. Those 13 years coincide with Motown's time in its home  city and namesake: Detroit. It's this period, from 1959 to 1972, that  Hip-O Select's ultra-comprehensive, beautifully packaged, and exhaustively  annotated <i>Complete Motown Singles</i> series of boxed sets will ultimately  cover when the final set is issued.</p>
<p>Previously, most of the sets  have encompassed a full year of output from Motown and its subsidiaries  (the exception was <i>Volume 1</i>, which covered 1959-1961), but 1971, the  label's last full year in Detroit, is represented by <i>two</i> five-disc  sets, discs 56-65 in the series. It's an enormous amount of music, made  slightly less substantial by the fact that many tracks, 57 in all, are  doubled up in stereo promo versions or alternate mixes. One gets the  sense from listening, reading, and perusing the tracklist that 1971 was  a difficult year for Motown in many respects. Faced with a dramatically  different pop landscape, a cumbersome operating structure split between  Detroit and Los Angeles, the fading stars of some of its long-time marquee  acts, and a lot more direct competition from other soul labels, Gordy's  empire showed its first signs of decline, even as it prepared to expand  into the movie business.</p>
<p>In 1970, seven Motown songs  topped the Billboard Hot 100. In 1971, only the Temptations' enduring  classic ""Just My Imagination"" managed to hit #1, though many Motown  releases topped the R&amp;B chart. That song, a tender, startlingly  intimate portrait of a man constructing an elaborate fantasy relationship  with a woman he doesn't even know, was a throwback to the rich harmony  sound the group had left behind in 1968, when producer Norman Whitfield  cranked up the funk and took them on the psychedelic soul ride that  made hits out of ""Cloud Nine"", ""I Can't Get Next to You"", ""Ball  of Confusion"", and others. It was also the last song to feature founding  members Eddie Kendricks, who went solo, and Paul Williams, who left  the group because of poor health. Kendricks gave perhaps the best performance  of his whole career to the song, which was backed on the B-side by ""You  Make Your Own Heaven and Hell Right Here on Earth"", another swirling,  psychedelic soul bomb.</p>
<p>Whitfield and the Tempts' stylistic  dip into the past serves as a sort of metaphor for much of the recycling  that took place at Motown in 1971. Whitfield himself cut most of his  songs with more than one artist, pulling out old tunes to rework,  and scoring a hit with the Undisputed Truth's spooky re-do of the Temptations  album track ""Smiling Faces Sometimes"". The Truth were Whitfield's  laboratory, where he worked on stretching the boundaries of his production  style, practice that helped him create some of the label's most enduring  tracks from the period. The recycling in other quarters of Motown was  a little more basic, as Gordy and his Los Angeles crew tried to boost  Diana Ross' still-precarious solo career by digging up the Four Tops'  ""Reach Out (I'll Be There)"". Radically reworked into a bombastic  two-part suite, it hit the Top 30, but doesn't hold a candle to the  Tops. Ross' best single in 1971 was ""Surrender"", a towering, cosmopolitan  soul track that features very Supremes-like backing vocals. The most  egregious example of the label raiding the past, though, was the Elgins'  ""Heaven Must Have Sent You"", a leftover from 1966 that must have  sounded awfully out of place in 1971, in spite of its quality.</p>
<p>The biggest value of these  sets is their unique ability to cast the biggest names and hits on Motown  in their context among the flops and oddities that competed with them  for attention. More than any set since 1964, this one is full of  bizarre asides, should-have-been-hits, and historical curiosities. Rare  Earth, Gordy's rock-oriented subsidiary, had a busy release schedule,  churning out mostly anodyne, easily forgotten album rock, but it was  occasionally interesting. The band the label was named for, Rare Earth,  scored big with the psychedelic funk track ""I Just Want to Celebrate"",  which still sounds pretty great, while the Messengers' super-catchy  power-pop number ""That's the Way a Woman Is"" deserved to place higher  than #62 on the pop chart, and British act Brass Monkey turns in an  interesting, progged-out cover of the Supremes' ""You Keep Me Hangin'  On"" that owes more to the Vanilla Fudge version than it does to the  original.</p>
<p>Far more puzzling today are  the true outliers on the set. Sammy Davis, Jr. and Berry Gordy co-founded  the Ecology label specifically for Davis' future releases, but after  one horrible flop-- the treacly, didactic ""In My Own Life Time""-- the  label quietly folded and the partnership ceased. Los Angeles DJ Tom  Clay's weird collage ""What the World Needs Now Is Love/Abraham, Martin  &amp; John"" clobbers the listener over the head with the sounds of  warfare, news reports about assassinations, and children talking trying  to define words like prejudice. Clay's other offering, on <i>Vol. 11B</i>,  is basically a song-poem, with its off-key vocal and inept songwriting.  Dave Prince's ""The Greatest Man Who Ever Lived"" is a weird spoken-word piece about Jesus on about the same par as Chuck Woolery's pre-""Love  Connection"" travesty ""The Greatest Love Affair"".</p>
<p>Other forgotten tracks fall  more in the treasure category, none more so than Gordon Staples &amp;  the Motown Strings' ""Strung Out"". Gordon Staples was the concertmaster  of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and played a Stradivarius violin,  but he was no classical music snob-- he lead numerous string sessions  for labels all over Detroit, and you can hear him all over the Motown  catalog. This wasn't so much his record, though, as it was long-time  Motown arranger Paul Riser's. His charts use the sound of the orchestra tuning up to brilliant effect and features  a heavy, sample-ready groove courtesy of the Funk Brothers. Chuck Jackson's  ""Pet Names"" showcases what a powerful, interesting singer he was,  his gravelly voice soaring through a wickedly tough, syncopated melody. Hugh Masekela's Chisa label ended its association with Motown in the early 70s, but not before Masekela and his Union of South Africa released the supercharged Afrofunk burner ""Dyambo (Weary Day Is Over)"", which features a strange and inspired scat vocal from Caiphus Semenya, on which he imitates the sounds of scratching records and elephants and somehow makes the song better.</p>
<p>Sammy Davis, Jr. wasn't the  only old crooner to pass through Motown that year. Bobby Darin, who  back in 1958 had cut a forgotten record on a song written by Berry Gordy,  attempted to reinvent himself as a singer/songwriter near the end of  his too-short life, and his ""Simple Song of Freedom"" is a pleasant  surprise-- it's not subtle at all, but it has an easy groove, and you  can hear in his performance that Darin was finally doing what he wanted  to on record. Brothers David and Jimmy Ruffin, who'd each had varying  levels of success and were both more popular in Europe than in the U.S.,  cut a record together in 1971 called <i>My Brother's Keeper</i>, and their  duo single ""Lo And Behold"" is an absolutely brilliant slice of gospel  soul, with great unison singing and a long, languid melody.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the reasons  this singles collection feels more scattered than most of its predecessors  is that, like the rest of the music industry, Motown in 1971 was trying  to transition to the era of the album. By far the label's greatest achievement  in that arena in 1971 was Marvin Gaye's epochal masterpiece <i>What's  Going On</i>. The missing question mark was intentional-- Marvin was  telling you what was going on, not asking, and what he saw was a nation  in turmoil, tied down in a senseless war, wasting its natural beauty,  and ignoring poverty. Gordy resisted <i>What's Going On</i> for as long as he could, agreeing to release it only after Gaye threatened  never to record again, and it was an instant landmark. The singles gathered  here are surprising for casual Gaye fans who know only the LP. The  title track appears in a drastically different (and inferior) mix from  the album version, ""Mercy Mercy Me"" and ""Inner City Blues"" are  understandably truncated to fit on 45s, and the B-side versions of ""Wholy  Holy"" and ""God Is Love"" are prototypes of the album versions that  use backing tracks from a session Marvin Gaye produced for the Originals.  It's a fascinating glimpse at the process that led him to the final  realization of his vision.</p>
<p>While Marvin Gaye finally got  the artistic freedom he desired and emerged with an enduring classic,  Stevie Wonder, now an adult, offered a foreshadowing of the amazing  run of albums he was about to create on the tender, aching ballad ""I  Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer"" and the complex, jazzy ""If  You Really Love Me"". As Stevie graduated onto an adult stage, Motown's  other kid sensation, Michael Jackson, stepped out on his own for the  first time, with the surprisingly adult ""Got to Be There"",  on which he sings about complexities of sexual relationships he couldn't  possibly have yet understood. Frankly, though, he still sounded a lot  better in the company of his brothers, especially on the jaw-dropping  ""Never Can Say Goodbye"", on which he sounds like a man spurned many  times over, trapped in the body of a child, singing his guts out.</p>
<p>There was still plenty of success  in Motown's future after 1971, but over  the course of these two sets, it becomes increasingly clear that things  changed for good at Motown, and that the focused creative crucible and  tight quality control that made the label such a dominant force in the  60s couldn't be recaptured. In spite of the changes, there was still  plenty of excellent music here, and if  you've been collecting these sets so far, you need these, too. As Motown  celebrates 50 years of making music, it's fascinating and entertaining  to revisit a time when it was still an active sculptor of the American  cultural landscape and see how the shifting landscape shaped it in return.</p></div>"|12880.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12880-the-complete-motown-singles-vol-11a-1971the-complete-motown-singles-vol-11b-1971/|8.9|Joe Tangari

Despite their budgetary restrains, the Life and Times have done their best to imbue their music with a sound and swagger enormous enough to theoretically fill any venue imaginable. It's been nearly four years since their debut, and that time's been well spent turning their awkwardly titled second album into a sonic monolith. While the group's previous works can't be accused of modesty or restraint, <i>Tragic Boogie</i> downright revels in its excess.</p>
<p>As with their first full length, <i>Suburban Hymns</i>, the Life and Times combine shoegazey guitars and textures with apocalyptic slabs of percussion and rhythm-- every time a drum is hit or a bass string is strummed, it's as if tectonic plates are being shifted. If you want to give the group some poetic leeway, they might be accused of describing their sound on ""Fall of the Angry Clowns""-- ""it's not unlike falling upwards."" Sadly, folks looking for words that match the heft of their sounds might be disappointed by the abstractions and imagistic meanderings the group employs. But on a record like this, words are a secondary concern-- whatever meanings these songs are meant to convey is done strictly through the music, and <i>Tragic Boogie</i> is at its best when it remembers this.</p>
<p>The second half peters out in this regard-- after offering an endless barrage of pyrotechnics, the title track and ""The Politics of Driving"" take a more genial and measured approach. Paired with ""The Lucid Dream"", a tune that bears an astonishing (and welcome) resemblance to Doves or a down-tempo Swervedriver, these three second-half tracks trip up the record's momentum-- the 100-car-pile-up outro of ""Politics"" tries to regain the album's hell-bent momentum, but to no avail. As nice as a respite from all this grandeur might seem, the band does itself no favors by playing against its strengths. The late-record detours can't hold a candle to the shameless bombast on display in ""Angry Clowns"", or the grand piano chords that strafe the entirety of ""Dull Knives"". From the first effected chord struck in the album's opener, ""Que Sera Sera"", to the moment in ""Confetti"" where the cacophony suddenly gives way to acoustic strumming, the Life and Times offer listeners a thrilling cinematic journey through their meticulously constructed world of sound. In fact, it's probably best to approach <i>Tragic Boogie</i> the way you'd approach a summer movie blockbuster-- there might not be much happening on the screen in terms of substantive depth, but it looks and sounds great, and the special effects are out of this world.</p></div>"|12978.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12978-tragic-boogie/|6.9|David Raposa

A sufficiently  catchy rock number that's found the San Diego-based duo some internet  love, the song blatantly steals from, among other classic pop tunes,  the Jesus and Mary Chain's 1989 semi-hit ""Head On"". And I don't  mean that bandmembers Charles Rowell and Brandon Welchez were just influenced  or inspired by the JAMC track, but that they've actually photocopied  its melody and plopped it into their own song. Now, I'm not suggesting  bands don't knick ideas from other acts (that's commonplace) or  that every new group is required to fashion its own utterly unique sound  (that's impossible), but theft is theft, and if this were college,  Crocodiles would be expelled for plagiarism.</p>
<p>So why is anyone interested  in these dudes? Well, they were name-checked by No Age in a 2008 year-end  list and, sadly, that's all it takes to build a buzz these days--  one mention from a well-known group and you're the next Wavves. That's  not No Age's fault or Crocodiles', but it does put on display the  absurdity of the internet music community's never-ending, indiscriminate  space race to find the next hot new band. In any case, it doesn't  make much sense to compare this group to the noise-pop acts they're  being lumped in with because, well, they're not very noisy. Outside  of the background squeal of ""I Wanna Kill"" and a distorted drumbeat  on (the <i>also</i> JAMC-aping) ""Refuse Angels"", most of what Crocodiles  do on their debut LP, <i>Summer of Hate</i>, is actually pretty clean  sounding.</p>
<p>The record's split into a  couple of different stylistic categories. In addition to the... let's  call it ""reverential"" rock stuff mentioned above, there are several  synth-pop tracks that range from slower pieces to more upbeat dance  numbers. What most of these songs lack in inventiveness they tend to  make up for in melody; if nothing else, these guys know their way around  a catchy hook. Despite sounding brazenly Rapture-lite, herky-jerky dance-punk  number ""Soft Skull (In My Room)"" is a fine-tuned hipster boogie. And synth stomper  ""Flash of Light"" is enough  of an earworm to wiggle into your head for a few hours.</p>
<p>Crocodiles present their smartest  work on the album's ballads, slower synth-pop pieces loosely built  around the form perfected by 80s crossover acts such as OMD and Tears  for Fears. They do some Beatles harmonizing atop wobbly Santo &amp;  Johnny guitars on ""Here Comes the Sky"" and construct a long, pleasant  synth-and-vocal build on ""Sleeping With the Lord""-- and these  are easily <i>Summer of Hate</i>'s best tracks. In fact, if the whole  record were done in this style, it'd be worth the buzz. Instead of  focusing on one idea and shaping it into something unique, though, the  album tries its hand at everything that is ""now"" (noise-pop, dance  rock, etc.) and owns none of it.</p></div>"|12969.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12969-summer-of-hate/|4.1|Joe Colly

I mean, this time, we know: In the year or so since the fitfully rewarding <i>Mountain Battles</i>, the Breeders have toured some, severed ties with 4AD, and-- in London, Chicago, and Dayton-- laid down the tracks that became their self-released <i>Fate to Fatal</i> EP. And, while you'd be hard up to find anybody who'd ever met ""Roi"" who'll tell you the Breeders hit any kind of artistic peak in this decade, by all accounts, the long periods of infighting and inebriation and, worst of all, inactivity that characterize far too much of their career appear behind 'em.</p>
<p>Shucks, the baddest twins in rock have even been biding their time down at the Dick Blick, and the hand-screened covers of the limited vinyl edish of <i>Fate to Fatal</i> will have been touched by at least one Deal, maybe both. As far as the return of the physical record as fetish object, well, you're not gonna do a lot better than that. As far as the record itself, though, <i>Fate to Fatal</i>'s just a little lucky it's got all that other stuff working for it. For a four-song affair, there's a lot to talk about before we get into how this music sounds: The packaging, yes, but Screaming Tree/Gutter Twin/hellspawn Mark Lanegan sings one of the tunes, and another's a cover of a Bob Marley cut. When I'm sliding the record out of its delightfully wonky cardboard sleeve, I am one happy sonofagun; I mean, I'm not immune to the charms of a quirky object made just for me and 999 other lucky sods by a band I've cared about for a good decade and a half. Once the needle hits <i>Fate to Fatal</i>, though, my mood swings.</p>
<p>Like every other Breeders record before it, <i>Fate to Fatal</i>'s opener kills-- though <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/11212-fate-to-fatal/"" target=""_blank"">my colleague David Raposa feels otherwise</a>. All brute force and giddy charm, the eponymous leadoff track is the Breeders at their most jarring and most exuberant, with churning power-chords beating out a kinda rhythm for the Deal gals to holler and shout over. But, oh, when they move from a scream to a whisper and back again, does it ever sound good. The Deals singing in tandem make one of the great noises in rock, and when you throw 'em all over a tune this kinetic, this heady, this pleasure-center-smacking, it just couldn't feel more right. Plus, I rather like my Breeders careening and stumbling and anti-produced.</p>
<p>Then there's the Lanegan-wheezed ""The Last Time"", on which the very special guest feels genuinely extraneous. It's a pretty nothing-song to begin with, little more than some strumming and a couple of ominous-sounding throwaway lines for the guy to growl and, sweet mercy, some much-needed atmospheric wooze around what I suppose you'd call the chorus. After the headrush of ""Fate to Fatal"", the staid, static ""Last Time"" is a total bringdown.</p>
<p>The Breeders have a history with unadorned, Everly Brothers-style harmony-heavy acoustic cuts (covers, often), and their Steve Albini-recorded take on Bob Marley's ""Chances Are"" doesn't stray from the formula much. It's plenty gorgeous, but it's a fairly slow acoustic version of another song, and it's terribly reminiscent of their equally fine take on Hank Williams' ""I Can't Help It (If I'm Still In Love With You)"" from the ""Divine Hammer"" single and their own ""Here No More"" from Mountain Battles. I could listen to them sing all day, and I'm awfully glad it's not ""Buffalo Soldier"", but it, like so many other attempts at Bob Marley tunes before it, doesn't linger.</p>
<p><i>Fate to Fatal</i> touches down with the spindly ""Pinnacle Hollow"", which, you'll notice, sounds a good bit like a demo. It certainly feels straight from the four track, anyway, and that's good and bad by turns. The analog conception adds a lot of sonic interest to what doesn't otherwise seem like a fully formed idea-- a demo, you know-- but then again, so do a lot of the better Breeders records. That said, it's hard to hold against this one the fact that it merely sounds like the beginnings of a great Breeders track. Though it starts out fluttering, ""Hollow"" settles into an appealingly stoney crawl to it, and the slack, almost bluesy vocal achieves what I suspect <i>Title TK</i>'s still-weird ""Sinister Foxx"" was shooting for. As it is, it's intoxicating, but I can't help but wonder what it'd sound like with a bridge. There's almost certainly something to be read into the resigned delivery on a line like ""I don't know a sin I haven't found,"" or the fact that the tune's named for the West Virginny holler where the apparently ailing Mama Deal grew up, but like any Breeders song with a couple-three lyrics and a whole lot of fuzz, it's resistant to easy interpretation. To paraphrase the Deals' fellow rocker Lil Wayne, it feels big, and that's all that has to be said on the matter.</p>
<p>I kept coming back to <a href=""http://pitchfork.com/news/35091-kim-and-kelley-deal-talk-new-breeders-ep-self-sufficiency-and-the-pixies/"" target=""_blank"">Pitchfork's recent interview with the Deals</a> while grappling with <i>Fate to Fatal</i>; even for a Breeders record and an EP still, it all just feels so casual, but from the song selection to the Lanegan-poaching down to the artwork, it sounds as if that was the idea all along. Casual is a fine look for the Breeders-- even if ""The Last Time"" is a little too casual-- and it's no bad thing to hear them having what sounds like a pretty good time goofing around. Plus, I'm plenty curious how bands big and small are figuring their ways around this batshit music economy we've got going, and for the Breeders-- well aware they're never going to sell a million copies of anything again-- this homespun limited-release coupled with readily available downloads and the possibility for more pressings seems as good a solution as any. Sure, I wish <i>Fate to Fatal</i> were a little more solid down the middle, but to hear Kim and Kelley tell it, it's meant to be an acrylic-slathered curio, odds and also sods, and as such, it's pretty wonderful. Wonderful, too, is that it's arrived so soon; had this been the first Breeders music hitting our ears in plural years, I doubt they'd get by with quite this much. Fact is, three new Breeders songs-- one great, one good, and one I've already forgotten-- and a not-half-bad cover is too nice a change of pace from a whole lotta nothing not to notice. And if nothing else, it'll have you wondering why they couldn't do this sort of thing more often.</p></div>"|12974.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12974-fate-to-fatal/|6.4|Paul Thompson

Just as there are certain types of music that sound better on vinyl,  the clean-room sound of that nearly obsolete silvery disc is the perfect  medium for certain styles mostly associated with the 90s alt-rock that  coincides with the technology's heyday. It's not an across-the-board  pairing, however. Pearl Jam were so into vinyl that they added scratches  to <i>Vitalogy</i>. But Stone Temple Pilots: CD. Candlebox: CD. Hanson: CD.  Fountains of Wayne: CD. The Smashing Pumpkins: CD (although I imagine they'd  be particularly loathe to admit it). Those last three acts are all represented  in the new group Tinted Windows. That's middle child Taylor Hanson  on vocals. Former Pumpkin James Iha on guitar. Fountain Adam Schlesinger  on bass. And on the skins! The one! The only! Bun! E.! Carlos! (Crowd  goes same). The drummer is obviously the odd man out here: Not only  is he old enough to be the singer's father, but Cheap Trick is old  enough to have intimately influenced each of his bandmates, their former  bands, and pretty much anyone they ever toured with. Also, Cheap Trick:  both vinyl and CD.</p>
<p>The result of this collaboration is  the kind of polished power pop that was popular and even a little edgy  for a brief period during the previous decade, and it's hard to tell  if Tinted Windows, with their power chords, studio-sculpted guitars,  and terrible name, are hopelessly dated and irrelevant or simply nostalgic  for a musical moment before CDs became technology's bitch-- right  above cassingles and right below eight-tracks. I was a little disappointed  that my copy wasn't sealed with one of those dogbone stickers, the  residue of which would remain long after the death of the medium and  even the death of me. On the other hand, the second or third best-selling  tween act in the country is a power-pop act-- Jonas Brothers-- who  take to the genre like a birthright and who really aren't so bad,  as far as that sort of thing goes. Is there a market for the style or  just for young brother acts?</p>
<p>Even if Tinted Windows are riding a  revivalist wave, the group's self-titled debut is pretty unsurprising  in its pop-rock format, and it may be cynical to think they've polished  it up and sanded it down to make it as broadly appealing as possible.  Songs open with a snappy riff; catchy choruses follow melodic verses;  and the opposite sex is the main subject matter. ""Kind of a Girl""  is the first song on their new album, and arguably the best, showcasing  Schlesinger's compact melodies and an interesting dynamic between  his bass line and Iha's guitar squall. Spelling out each woah-woah  in the lyrics sheet is a nice touch, and a reminder to say good-bye  to liner notes. Unfortunately, those may be the wittiest lyrics in the  song, whose title promises a character who's not entirely a girl,  but just kind of a girl. Instead, Schlesinger, whose pop sensibility  once seemed dead-on, writes like he's still on the <i>That Thing You  Do</i> set.</p>
<p><i>Tinted Windows</i> is best when  the tempo is fast and the momentum relentless, which makes ""Kind of  a Girl"" a strong leadoff and ""Can't Get a Read on You"" almost  desperately fast. The highlight of ""Messing with My Head""-- the  real keeper here-- may be Hanson's performance, which showcases a  cool falsetto yelp and subtle growl in his otherwise everyguy vocals. As the pace of the songs slow, the intensity flags and the album sags. The big,  midtempo chords of ""Dead Serious"" herald a lackluster chorus, faux-breathless  vocals, <i>de rigueur</i> guitar fanfares, and an egregiously unexcitable use  of ""hey hey hey!"" Those are all Schlesinger compositions; Iha and  Hanson fare worse in the songwriting department: the guitarist's ""Cha  Cha"" is a grating Cheap Trick knock-off that should have given the  drummer pause, and the singer's ""Nothing to Me"" grafts a pretty  mean-spirited kiss-off to a pretty limp hook.  But at least neither  of them is responsible for the bass player's insipid montage rocker  ""Without Love"", whose faux uplift is tempered with moldy pop clichés  like ""Without love the nights are so long."" Sure, lyrics aren't  as crucial as melody and momentum, but how can you sing along if you're  always cringing?</p>
<p>Ultimately, the whole of Tinted Windows  is so much less than the sum of its considerable parts that it's almost  tragic. In playing to pop's imagined past, this quartet neglect the  idiosyncrasies that made them such compelling individual artists: the  inventiveness of Iha's solo work, the humor and specificity of Fountains,  the exuberance of ""Mmmbop"", the sweet escapism of Cheap Trick in  the 70s. If there are dollar bins in the future, that's where you'll  find this failed debut.</p></div>"|12957.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12957-tinted-windows/|3.5|Stephen M. Deusner

It felt like every 606 single or CD was a window onto both a restless post-teen imagination and an American underground violently remaking European electronic innovations, whether brainy or boneheaded. But tastes shift, spending money dries up, life intervenes, shit happens. So caveat emptor: my lapsed fandom means I can't say with any certainty how <i>Shout at the Döner</i> fits into the still dense Kid606 discography as a whole.</p>
<p>What I do know is that it's a hell of a lot of fun-- a rough, dirty party album, a trawl through two decades of abusive bass and dancefloor bad taste. Then as now, it's the sort of digi-noise terror mixed messily in firetrap lofts and warehouses with crappy acoustics. On ""Hello Serotonin, My Old Friend""-- nice to see he hasn't lost his way with a punning title-- good ol' mechanical ""Mentasm"" synth effects shriek, eventually swallowed by a chaotic breakdown. But being dance music, rather than fried-circuit free noise, it's the viciously jacking drum track that's the real head-flattener. Make no mistake, <i>Shout At The Döner</i> is a rhythm record. It just takes its programming cues from those foolhardy German and Dutch pioneers who sped Chicago snares and Detroit kicks into a gleefully abusive pummel.</p>
<p>Not every track is necessarily as abrasive as ""Hello Serotonin""; a few could even slot onto a quasi-mainstream comp, if not quite your average super-club set. ""You All Break My Heart"" is more-or-less diva house. But even with the noise turned down (just a notch), those R&amp;B ad libs and crashing electro drums  can only be described as ""manic."" Like the rest of the best of <i>Shout at the Döner</i>, ""You All Break My Heart"" feels ripped from that moment in any great DJ's set when the audience's screams start to challenge the din coming off the decks and you start eyeballing the exits just in case. This is an album that celebrates a history of hysteria and claustrophobia, of adverse reactions and temple-clutching come downs. A throwback to early 90s dark rave (""Dancehall of the Dead"") even induces tongue-in-cheek panic via a sample of Nick Cave asking dancers ""who wants to die?"" Somewhere a half-forgotten hardcore producer is listening at his day job and kicking himself for not having combed the Birthday Party catalog first.</p>
<p>As all of these references to 10- or 15- or even 20-year-old subgenres might suggest, yes, <i>Shout at the Döner</i> will feel mighty familiar to anyone who's spent time exploring the fuglier side of dance, the gabba greats and acid addicts who flayed their black boxes until they cried ""oom"" (or ""onkel""). But call it retro in service of sweat and smiles, celebrating the ridiculousness of dance music at its loudest and most unmannered. To illustrate how little distance separates the frenzy-inducing floor-fillers of 1989 and 2009, the Kid even offers a cheeky ""cover"" of 4 Hero's ""Mr. Kirk's Nightmare"", connecting the grotty hip-house of first-wave rave and the shamelessly cheesy bass wobble of current dubstep. If the recent noisy excesses of the Ed Bangers and Alter Egos of the world left a bad taste in your mouth, <i>Shout at the Döner</i> is not for you. If you're old enough to need earplugs, but also lament dance music's 21st-century slide into gentility, here's a way to relive its dumb-ass glory days in the safety of your home.</p></div>"|12962.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12962-shout-at-the-doner/|6.8|Jess Harvell

Now, whether  love is stronger than swine flu remains to be seen, but for Persson,  it ultimately doesn't matter-- for her, the power of love is measured  not by the elation but the devastation. Ever since presenting herself  as a model of cheery Scandinavian congeniality on the cover of the Cardigans' <i> Life</i> back in 1995, Persson has played up the ironic distance between  her pixie-esque appearance and the emotional unrest stirring in so many  of her songs; on her second album as A Camp, the tally  of bruised egos and broken hearts practically reaches pandemic proportions.</p>
<p>The real irony here is that Persson's husband,  Shudder to Think guitarist Nathan Larson, rides shotgun on this trail of rocky romances. Along with co-producer  Niclas Frisk, he pushes Persson out of the forest fantasias created  by Sparklehorse's Mark Linkous on A Camp's 2001 debut towards a sound  that, true to Larson's glam-rock pedigree, is both more regal and  urbane. As a solo outlet, the A Camp guise allows Persson to avoid the  assumed confessional baggage that plagues so many singer-songwriters  performing under their own name. And <i>Colonia</i>'s luxuriant presentation  makes it easier to imagine Persson as, well, a different person: the  medieval mistress sarcastically saluting her ""murderous ass"" of  a king on ""The Crowning""; the subservient rock-star groupie on the  rollicking ""My America""; or the trophy wife in the acerbic lullaby  ""I Signed the Line"" who decides she wants to cash out. And by fortuitous  circumstance,  ""Here Are Many Wild Animals""-- a study of  primal desires cast in a girl-group gloss-- is given extra bite due  to the fact the artist it most clearly references, Phil Spector, was  recently caged for his own unsuppressed bloodlust.</p>
<p>Given Persson's facility as a storyteller,  it figures that <i>Colonia</i>'s spell is broken whenever she breaks from  character. ""Chinatown"", a snow-covered stroll through Persson's  favorite New York 'hood, tries too hard to mythologize its everyday  scenery, piling on the choral vocals, synthetic orchestration, and Asian  guitar accents. And while the meta-duet with Nicolai Dunger on ""Golden  Teeth and Silver Medals""-- wherein the two address each other by  name and sing about singing a love song together-- has designs on  subverting traditional pop-singer pairings, its blustery, spotlight-clamoring  chorus essentially renders it a Swedish indie answer to wedding-song  standards like ""Up Where We Belong"". But <i>Colonia</i> is mostly careful  to use its expanded palette of sounds for subtle shading rather than  gratuitous effect. This is particularly evident on the sublime closer, ""The Weed Had  Got There First"", a serene piano-rolled promenade in which Persson  chronicles a history of let-downs in botanical terms, but the closing  passage-- where Persson blissfully la-di-da's along with the string  section-- suggests regret is a feeling she's grown accustomed to.  And so it is in <i>Colonia</i>'s quietest moment that Persson's greatest  gift becomes most audible: her knack for passing off disappointment  as fulfillment.</p></div>"|12973.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12973-colonia/|6.7|Stuart Berman

Since he's essentially a solo artist and his sound has not changed significantly, the shift to a band identity seems to be mainly in the interest of pragmatism. (If you search for Michael Johnson in the iTunes store, you will mostly find the work of a soft rock singer/songwriter from the 1970s.)</p>
<p>Ape School specialize in jaunty yet hazy psychedelia directly indebted to the Silver Apples, United States of America, and other early innovators of electronic instrumentation. Though many others have attempted to mimic the sound of those classic works, Johnson has the advantage of working with one of the earliest Moog analog synthesizers, which lends his recordings an uncanny air of authenticity. Even if there are telltale signs of modern technology and musical influence throughout the album, nearly all of the songs could pass as vintage tunes. This mostly comes down to the fact that Johnson's affections are very low-key, and that he entirely avoids the sort of self-conscious meta touches that typically characterize each successive wave of psychedelic revivalism. Most often, it seems as though he is simply writing songs to flatter the established strengths of his instrument. Of course, the downside of that approach is that his Moog tones never feel particularly fresh or surprising, even when the sound itself is quite interesting and appealing.</p>
<p>As an album,<i> Ape School</i> displays an admirable dynamic range, but it nevertheless has an extremely limited emotional palette. Despite its continuum of melodies and tempos, every track conveys feelings that are indeterminate and passionless, which has a way of making the record as a whole drift by in a blur. To a certain extent, this must be the desired effect of Johnson's compostions-- much of the lyrics indicate indecision and muted emotions, and several tracks deliberately detour into zoned-out reveries. That strategy is most effective in ""Did What I Did"", which starts off as a bouncy British Invasion number before drifting out into a slow mantra over an ambient keyboard hum. Johnson is also successful when he leans hard on groovy percussion, as in the Silver Apples sound-alike ""My Intention"", and the vaguely aggressive ""Deathstomp"". The quality of the songwriting dips somewhat in the album's final third, but there are no outright duds, and it's easy to forgive aimless numbers like ""In Time You Are"" and ""Floridian Grime"" when the record is mostly characterized by the tunefulness of frontloaded highlights such as ""Wail to God"", ""That's OK"", and ""Be an Encore"".</p>
<p>In the right mood-- or altered state-- <i>Ape School</i> is a pleasure, but outside of that state of mind, the music can seem somewhat lacking. Johnson's talent is hard to deny, but he could do well to become more ambitious in his arrangements. His tastes in melody, rhythm, and texture are exceptional, but ultimately his work is low on inspiration and originality. <i>Ape School</i> is a respectable album, but it's hard not to wonder if Michael Johnson is capable of doing much more with his skills and equipment than what is evident in these recordings.</p></div>"|12975.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12975-ape-school/|6.3|Matthew Perpetua

Perhaps not coincidentally, these people  are invariably bassists: John Paul Jones in Led Zeppelin, Bill Wyman  in the Rolling Stones and, in the case of Jane's Addiction, Eric Avery,  who-- not wishing to tarnish the band's trailblazing 1987-1991 legacy-- opted out of lucrative reunion tours in 1997 and 2001. Perry Farrell  may have gotten all the ""Alternative Nation""–spokesman plaudits, Stephen  Perkins may have gotten all the <i>Modern Drummer</i> covers, and Dave Navarro  may have gotten all the Carmen Electra, but Avery was the band's pulse. His brooding, PiL-popping basslines provided the ominous undercurrent  that gave depth to the band's glam-metal veneeer. Take him out of  the equation, and Jane's veer dangerously close to becoming just another  flashy L.A. rock band-- a point driven home by 2003's Avery-less  reunion album, <i>Strays</i>, which, fittingly, is survived only by its Aerosmithy  single ""Superhero"" becoming the opening theme to flashy L.A. TV  show ""Entourage"".</p>
<p>Avery's surprising re-entry into the  Jane's fold last year is therefore significant-- so much so, it warrants  a box-set celebration. The 4xCD <i>A Cabinet of Curiosities</i>-- two  CDs of demos/rarities from 1986-91, a third featuring a 1990 live-show  recording, and a DVD of assorted video ephemera-- could've theoretically  been released at any point in the past 18 years, but the bassist's  return provides the band with a somewhat justifiable reason to cash  in now, honey. And what a lovely piece of furniture it is: <i>A Cabinet  of Curiosities</i> arrives in a wooden, latched-door case, which opens up  into a shrine-like assemblage of album and poster art, a thick booklet  featuring testimonials from fans like Slash, Flea, and Billy Corgan,  plus tarot cards and miniature worry dolls for each member. Leave it  to Jane's Addiction-- a band who, at the height of 80s hair-metal,  revitalized such hoary, unfashionable devices as goth, funk, proggy  dinosaur-rock, and drum circles-- to raise the standard for CD box  sets just as the medium is about to die.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all that elaborate packaging  can't mask the fact there aren't very many curiosities to uncover  here. As previous odds'n'sods collections <i>Live and Rare</i> and <i>Kettle  Whistle</i> attested, Jane's didn't leave many leftovers behind; of  the 29 outtakes compiled on <i>Cabinet</i>'s first two discs, only four are  originals that didn't feature on the band's first three albums,  and three of those (the psych reverie ""Kettle Whistle"", the Stonesy  folk ditty ""City"", and Farrell's woefully silly tribute to his  cat, ""Maceo"") were already unveiled on <i>Kettle Whistle</i>, makinging an embryonic version of future <i>Strays</i> track ""Suffer Some"" (elements of which would be repurposed into ""No One's Leaving"") the lone revelation.</p>
<p>The real lure, then, should be a handsome  batch of previously unreleased demos that would form the foundation  for 1987's self-titled live-album debut and 1988's breakthrough  <i>Nothing's Shocking</i>. However, for all the tales of druggy decadence  that surrounded their early years, Jane's showed up in the studio  with their shit pretty much together, which means there's little mercurial  mystique to be heard in early rips through ""Had a Dad"" and ""Pigs  in Zen"". The purpose may be to showcase Jane's in their most primal  state; however, unlike most products of the 1980s punk underground,  Jane's were never built for lo-fi-- they demanded a wide-screened  sound as big as the mountains and oceans Farrell sang about. And hearing  Farrell strain his voice on ""Jane Says"", you realize how much of  his androgynous charisma owed to the multi-tracked vocal effects favored  by producer Dave Jerden. The most notable thing about the demos aren't  the performances so much as the recording dates: Even as far back as  1987, Jane's had already mapped out the multi-sectional intricacies  of ""Stop!"" and ""Three Days"", three years before they would surface  on 1990's <i>Ritual de lo Habitual</i>.</p>
<p>The rest of <i>Cabinet</i>'s first two discs  is filled out with covers that cheekily acknowledge the  band's internal hippie/punk contradictions, particularly on ""Bobhaus""  (Dylan's ""Like a Rolling Stone"" set to Bauhaus' ""Burning From  the Inside"") and ""L.A. Medley"", a blitzkrieged blast through the  Doors' ""L.A. Woman"", the Germs' ""Lexicon Devil"", and X's  ""Nausea"" (though, 18 years after the track first appeared on the  ""Classic Girl"" single, its components are still listed in the wrong  order). Concert recordings of Led Zeppelin's ""Whole Lotta Love""  and the Stooges' ""1970"" don't transcend garage-band trashiness;  by contrast, Jane's Addiction have never sounded more blissful and  beautiful than on their tribute-album transformation of the Grateful  Dead's ""Ripple"", which grafts the original's campfire melody  onto a rolling jungle-rumble groove and practically invents Animal Collective  10 years early.</p>
<p>A showdown between Farrell and Ice-T on Sly Stone's  ""Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey"" is more leadfooted, but, in retrospect, it serves a prescient soundtrack  to an L.A. whose simmering racial tensions were about to explode into  riots. The set's third disc-- a complete concert recorded at the Hollywood Palladium in December 1990-- provides an even more vivid sense of time and place. If the preceding demos and cover versions mostly deconstruct the Jane's myth, this live set reasserts their majesty, with thundering versions of ""Three Days"" and ""Ocean Size"" that evoke that scary/ecstatic feeling of losing your footing in the mosh pit and getting swept up in the tide.</p>
<p>The Palladium performance of ""Ain't No Right""--  the one followed by Farrell's rant about Birkenstocks-- is presented  in visual form on <i>Cabinet</i>'s fourth disc, which charts Jane's evolution  through their videos, short films, and concert footage. While Nirvana's  <i>Nevermind</i> is often credited with wiping hair-metal off the charts in  one fell swoop, Jane's catalogue of videos shows them mobilizing the  masses away from 80s Sunset Strip sleaze to the 90s alt-rock uprising.  Like so many California rock bands of its time, Jane's Addiction filled  their videos with images of the Hollywood Hills, surfing, pool parties,  and (when network censors permitted them) naked chicks. But their aesthetic  remove from the L.A. scene is best exemplified by the 1989 hodgepodge  short-film <i>Soul Kiss</i>, reproduced here from a VHS copy and comprised  of candid shots of Avery discussing his toilet reading while taking  a dump; Navarro providing a ""Cribs""-like tour of his squalid apartment  (anticipating his future as reality-TV show huckster); and everyone  in the band making out with each other.</p>
<p>However, <i>Cabinet</i> is lacking one crucial  video curio: <i>Gift</i>, Farrell's feature-length, fictionalized account  of his heroin-fuelled romance with then-girlfriend Casey Niccoli. History,  of course, would show Farrell to be more adept at staging musical festivals  than making films; <i>Gift</i> is a mess, its central narrative concerning  the Niccoli character's OD routinely upended by tangential Jane's  concert footage (including the aforementioned ""Ain't No Right""  clip) and other episodic silliness. But at the time of its 1993 release,  <i>Gift</i> was a suitably absurd epitaph to an absurd band whose excesses  initially got the better of them. For a box set that indulges die-hard  fandom as eagerly as this one, <i>A Cabinet of Curiosities</i> feels a little  barren without it. Or maybe they're just saving the reissue for the  <a href=""http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/jane-s-addiction-reunion-marred-by-feuds-1003964174.story"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">next reunion tour</a>.</p></div>"|12966.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12966-a-cabinet-of-curiosities/|6.0|Stuart Berman

Although his duties were predominantly as keyboardist, he was best known for contributing to the group's notoriously hyperactive live shows, during which he often ran wild-eyed into the audience, manically banging a gigantic drum and scaling the stage rafters alongside BSP guitarist Martin Noble.</p>
<p>Given his engaging stage presence and appetite for writing swift, sharp songs that reel and rage like sonic blisters, it's not surprising that Hamilton was soon approached by three other staples of the Brighton rock scene: brothers Alex and Tom White of the Electric Soft Parade, and bass player Marc Beatty of the Tenderfoot. This gave a new lease on life to Brakes, as the band expanded the scope of Hamilton's unfussy songwriting while giving it more substance. In 2006, Hamilton amicably left British Sea Power to concentrate on Brakes. Following the release of their 2005 Rough Trade debut, <i>Give Blood</i>, which featured the heated admonishment ""Cheney""-- arguably one of the best nine-second songs ever recorded-- the band went on to release<i> Beatific Visions</i> before signing to FatCat for their third full-length, <i>Touchdown</i>.</p>
<p>Like many great punk bands, Brakes have found their formula with a-less-is-more approach. Although their range might seem straightforward at first, it's their decision to intersperse the boisterous blast of songs such as ""Porcupine or Pineapple"" or ""Red Rag"" with the reflective indie pop of ""Isabel"" and ""Crush On You"" that really makes this band compelling and instantly likeable. On <i>Touchdown</i>, they flip easily between the tough racket of ""Hey Hey"", the sparkly indie of ""Worry About It Later"", and the soft country lilt of ""Leaving England"". There is definitely a shift of focus on this album. While Hamilton's lyrical wit, which veers from cleverly biting to absurdly goofy, continues to take center stage, the songs sound more pulled together than ever and injected with an unabashed optimism that suits the music well: ""I was punching the air on this lonely drive/ Singing goddamn I'm happy just to be alive!"" he sings over a chug of distortion on ""Don't Take Me to Space (Man)"".</p>
<p>This type of unpretentious, smart, straight-no-chaser rock has been somewhat lacking in British indie music for the last few years, so it's good to hear Brakes pushing all the right buttons. Although only one song passes the five-minute mark, <i>Touchdown</i> overflows with ideas imaginatively sifted from a range of genres, and feels honest, infectious, and personable from beginning to end.</p></div>"|12849.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12849-touchdown/|7.7|Mia Clarke

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Maybe you can chalk it up to their unique (awkward) name, but I'm still surprised Throw Me the Statue didn't earn more attention on the strength of their debut LP, <i>Moonbeams</i>. There was just something about it that sounded as though you'd end up hearing it everywhere, but unless I'm shopping in the wrong stores or not earning the right credits from my soft drink purchases or something, I certainly wouldn't consider myself inundated by Throw Me the Statue lately. Reitherman's seemingly easy way around a riff, matched with his ability to casually dart out easily appealing tunes both peppy and not so much-- the same thing that earned the Shins and Death Cab radio play-- and the band's plinky technicolor-twee arrangements really worked together, it did really seem destined for a thousand iPods<span> </span>Moonbeams was not only an assured, promising (if overlong) record, but it sported a couple-three songs as earwormy as anything you see pushing earbuds lately. Still, the closest Throw Me the Statue came to breaking out was their I-sooo-called-it Rhapsody ad, but I bet even members of TMTS didn't quite catch whose song that was.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Whatever's in store, it's probably not coming on the back of the disappointing <i>Purpleface</i> EP. At four songs-- one of 'em a redo of Moonbeams' ""Written in Heart Signs, Faintly""-- and roughly 16 minutes, <i>Purpleface</i> doesn't nearly go far enough in showcasing Reitherman's budding melodic talent, offering instead a bit more of the bummed-out balladry that bogged down the last third of <i>Moonbeams</i>. When it comes down to it, it's a proximity issue: slowish jam, slow jam, slow jam, slowish jam, and a few too many clunkers in a row for something this slight.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Swarming guitars, windowpane-splatter drums, and what sounds to be a mini-megaphone can't save opener ""That's How You Win"" from its own slightness, but the other three tracks here are as tender and troubled-sounding as any of the sleepier moments from Moonbeams. The update of ""Heart Signs"" is fairly unnecessary; somebody thought to replace the spare acoustic plucking of the original with a heavy glaze of orchestration, and the song lives on to tug at another set of heartstrings. ""Honeybee"" is the prize, a buzzy slow-burner with a gauzy, gorgeous instrumental interlude and raspy Reitherman's best vocal performance on wax since <i>Moonbeams</i>' title track. There's a deliberateness to ""Honeybee"" that's lacking in the two other new Purpleface numbers, and it's telling that it's the least adorned track here: There's no need to dress up an already affecting tune. Clattering closer ""Ship"" is awfully pleasant, mercifully picking up the rhythm just a smidge in its midsection. Throughout, though, the performances feel weirdly dispassionate, as if Reitherman and company were treating this like a placeholder EP.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">And so it is, I suppose. <span>But there's certainly a least a few something elses holding TMTS back a little bit. I think Reitherman's way with the pen is second only to his way around sculpture; he</span>'<span>s done some good lyrics in the past, but he certainly didn</span>'<span>t dogear anything particularly interesting for </span><i>Purpleface</i><span>. Reitherman's got a reasonably nonchalant singing voice, particularly on the slower ones here it seems, and that, coupled with his lyrics, sometimes means the song never quite sticks. The first verse of ""Written in Heart Signs, Faintly"" is actually a fairly nice piece of writing, but the second reminds me a lot of Vanessa Carlton, and not the Vancessa Carlton song I like. ""Honeybee"" seems to call for a simple, direct lyric, and it delivers, even when Reitherman</span>'<span>s voice seems slightly obscured by the music and his own casualness. ""That's How You Win"" is just overwhelmed with nonsensey phrases spit out without any discernible thread behind 'em, which ends up this weird talky go-nowhere electronic bummer like one of the lesser numbers on R.E.M.'s <i>Up</i></span><span> or something. The other songs really are better than that one, but even still, ""Ship"" still doesn't hang in your brain much longer than Reitherman takes to say it. Some of those <i>Moonbeams</i></span><span> lyrics were awfully good-- the sad romantic travelogue ""Young Sensualists"" chief among 'em-- but a lot of them, too, took this impressionistic tack sometimes to their detriment. The big difference, of course, is that they were attached to better tunes. </span></p>

On the mic, frontlady Isis is so deadpan you wonder if she even knows it, especially when championing sex and conspicuous consumption with the aplomb of a Top 40 rapper. Producer Grahm Zilla shows off a deep record collection spanning from disco to Detroit techno to old school hip-hop, though his retro rehashing lacks the obsessive enthusiasm of fellow indie rap acts Lupe Fiasco and the Cool Kids. While these factors are likely to scramble your post-everything irony circuits, the sad fact is that Thunderheist lack the artistry for something as nuanced as hipster rap, and they're probably just a broad rap act that's too drab for mainstream success.</p>
<p>When your big blogosphere splash is a thugged out take on ""Sweet Dreams"" like Thunderheist's 2007 single ""Sueños Dulces"", you're already standing on pretty shaky ground. On their first full-length, the duo still can't hone a shtick of their own, relying instead on a bland mix of homage and innocuous one-liners. ""Jerk It"" tries to shock in the vein of Peaches or CSS but comes off as polite recommendation, made even more ho-hum by its cadence, which apes Missy Elliot's ""Work It"". Most of Isis's lyrics dwell on similarly obvious and well-examined arguments like ""sex is desirable,"" ""dancing is fun,"" or ""shiny things are nice to own."" Sure, there's ""Freddie"", which gently taunts an aging cokehead, but most of the tracks here seem intended to cheerlead for drunk, horny people already on the dancefloor.</p>
<p>Mr. Zilla keeps the album's head above water with a couple electro gems that accommodate the garden variety lyrics. Sparks fly on ""Nothing 2 Step 2"" and ""Space Cowboy"", two searing electro-dance numbers sharing the amphetamine restlessness of Crystal Castles or Vitalic. Closer ""Anthem"" provides too little variation too late, but its Justice-esque arena-techno posturing at least shows glimpses of stronger material to come. Still, with its unchecked endorsement of bull-market indulgence and broad creative strokes, Thunderheist's first offering feels hollow. Isis doesn't shed light on her own character with origin stories or ""my <i>x</i> is better than your <i>x</i>"" braggadocio, and Zilla's literal take on his influences can feel downright algorithmic at times, like a RIYL music app. While this sort of proactive fandom hardly qualifies as bad art, you'd have to get pretty smashed to ignore the album's missing spirit and just dance, which, sadly, may be the point here.</p></div>"|12956.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12956-thunderheist/|4.4|Adam Moerder

First you have to find ways to keep the energy alive and cohesive without being able to feed off each other on the spot; then there are time differences to negotiate and the natural ebb and flow of personal inspiration and schedules to plan around. With these obstacles in place, it's tough to remain on the same page as your collaborator. So how about when you've never met the musician you are working with? Such was the case for Belgian-based producer Joëlle Phuong Minh Lê (Greetings From Tuskan) and Canadian indie-rap artist Buck 65 when they created their debut album, <i>More Heart Than Brains</i>, under the moniker Bike For Three! (Full disclosure: I contributed a guitar part to a track from Buck 65's <i>Dirtbike Trilogy</i>.)</p>
<p>Of course, there are advantages to writing songs this way. Since each presence is designed to motivate the other from afar and relies on an interdependent exchange of surprises and ideas, a clearer mesh of distinct identities can emerge. This is certainly the case on <i>More Heart Than Brains</i>. As it's name reflects, this is a highly personal and tender album, rich with musings on adventure, love, and the mysteries of life. Phuong Minh Lê, an outstanding electronic artist, handled the composition and production, while Buck 65 contributed the lyrics, which run fast and furious through every track with his typically visceral and expressive delivery.</p>
<p>Both musicians stand apart-- Buck 65 with his sharp lyrical details and storytelling, and the flinty glitz of Phuong Minh Lê's exquisite, shimmering landscape that rarely plays by the rules as it constantly shifts and dives, resurfacing unpredictably as she throws remarkable textural surprises into the mix. Together they create something very special. ""Nightdriving"", ""Lazarus Phenomenon"", and ""Always I Will Miss You. Always You"", show Bike For Three! at their best as their ideas fuse seamlessly and naturally. A couple of times things fall off track, such as the futuristic, awkward shagginess of ""MC Space"", but it's mostly exciting to hear Buck 65, who has been fiercely productive for 15 years, rise to the challenges set by Phuong Minh Lê.</p>
<p>There's something almost voyeuristic in listening to such an intimate musical relationship built on exchanging confidential messages to one another, but it's this warmth that gives the record its spirit. <i>More Heart Than Brains</i> shows that Bike For Three! have plenty of ideas left to mine in the future, whether they meet or not. Perhaps they never will. As Buck 65 sings on ""Let's Never Meet"": ""Let's never meet and regret a past endeavor/ What we have is rare indeed and guaranteed to last forever.""</p></div>"|12967.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12967-more-heart-than-brains/|7.5|Mia Clarke

(Hell, it's more tween-pop than teen-pop anyway.) But what about the kind  of stuff that, say, the ""1979"" video lionized-- breaking into your  folks' liquor cabinet, obliterating the speed limit despite just getting  your learner's permit, leaving your hometown for the first time and discovering  how small it feels.  What about jamming out with your best bud  and deciding to call it a band?</p>
<p>These are the kind of gut-level  concerns <i>Post-Nothing </i>trades in, and I know, on paper it describes  an itch that a late-1990s Vagrant record could scratch.  And combined  with the fact that the band is called freakin' <i>Japandroids</i>,  it's easy to not take it seriously.  Which is fine, since Japandroids  do not make particularly complex music: Brian King plays broad chords  stewed in mid-90s fuzz (think Superchunk) while David Prowse  splays spastic but never showy drum fills that beg to be pounded out on your steering wheel.  There's maybe one overdub on the  whole thing and occasionally, both of them yell at the same time.   Several songs have less than five lines.  And while they've been  known to cover Mclusky's ""To Hell With Good Intentions"" live,  what makes <i>Post-Nothing </i>such a blast is how Japandroids tend  to embody the opposite sentiment of that song title. This is terminally catchy music played with punk's enthusiasm  and velocity, and maybe it's the fact that there's only two dudes  in this band that makes you feel like joining in to bash along.   It's as fun as an ill-gotten sixpack and there really aren't too  many bands doing stuff like this well anymore.</p>
<p>Recent trends, however, might  make you think otherwise: Due to their two-man setup  and no-frills recording, Japandroids risk being lumped into the increasingly  tiresome no-fi/noise-pop scene that finds bands using distortion to  tear through the fabric of the medium and, in some cases, drown out weak songs.  Either way, there's some form  of obfuscation, but what makes <i>Post-Nothing </i> such a thrill is the manner in which Japandroids hold absolutely nothing  back.  As contagious as any of the lyrics, melodies, riffs, or drum  fills are, their energy and lack of self-consciousness is every  bit as equally lovable. Opening mission statement ""The Boys Are Leaving Town"" could be seen as a goof on Thin Lizzy, but the  response, ""Will we find our way back home?"", is delivered with such  conviction that between those two lines, ""Boys"" displays a palpable desperation.  Six tracks later, the question is still unresolved-- amidst the cyclical thrum of ""Sovereignty"", they observe: ""It's raining, OH-OH!  in Vancouver/ But I don't give a fuck/ 'Cause I'm far from home  tonight.""</p>
<p>So yeah, it's a record about  distance. For the most part it's a record about the distance between  themselves and girls.  Too often, similar records find themselves  lapsing into easy misogyny, and while ""Heart Sweats"" skirts the  issue, the in-jokes are kinda duds.  Nonetheless, its thick  riff is a good introduction to the less excitable but still very exciting  side B.  ""Crazy/Forever"" is heaving stoner rock (think Black  Mountain with hooks), and closer ""I Quit Girls"" is about as close  to a power ballad as Japandroids will allow themselves.  It's  full of musical drama-- King reaches for falsetto amidst almost-synthetic  guitar EQ'ing and it's the longest stretch of time with no drumming,  but the whole thing is leavened by a tongue-in-cheek pledge of devotion from Rowse: ""After her, I quit girls.""</p>
<p>The distance is emotional as  well as physical on ""Wet Hair"", and I'll be surprised if I play  another song in 2009 as much as this one.  Its structure is almost  comically linear-- there's three lines in the whole thing, and the  most ridiculous one gets repeated for nearly half of its three minutes,  something about going to France to French kiss some French girls.   There's hardly even a verse-chorus structure, just a single melody  that repeats itself <i>faster</i> after the drums drop out.  But  it's one hell of a melody, and it's lyric, like much of <i>Post-Nothing</i>, doesn't need to be analyzed or even <i> understood </i>to be felt.  <i> </i></p>
<p>Where it all comes together best is ""Young Hearts Spark Fire"". Almost a flipside to LCD Soundsystem's  ""All My Friends"", it's thematically similar, trading wistful reminiscence  for drunken defiance and pulsing electro for chaotic garage rock.  The five minutes  go by in a blur, and amidst the guitar heroics and cymbal-bashing, King lets his  guard down on <i>Post-Nothing</i>'s key line-- ""We used to dream/ Now  we worry about dying/ I don't want to worry about dying.""  It  would be so easy to view this sort of musical and lyrical directness  with suspicion, but ""Young Hearts"" is life-affirming stuff-- if only  it affirms that, even in these times, life doesn't need to be as complicated as we tend to make it.</p></div>"|12965.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12965-post-nothing/|8.3|Ian Cohen

Qualitatively, that is; there are certainly audible links between and within each of Herren's not-quite-disparate endeavors. Despite being most identified with genres known for their rhythmic punch (hip-hop) and textural layering (glitch electronica), the Prefuse 73 discography is united by Herren's skill with <i>melody</i>, the warm glue binding his often ultra-fractured rhythm and noise together. It's the comforting low-end hum of fusion-era organs, or the bright synth line guiding listeners through his gloriously disorienting vocal and percussion edits.</p>
<p>And no Prefuse album has ever felt so thoroughly <i>edited</i> than the new <i>Everything She Touched Turned Ampexian</i>. An hour-ish mosaic of rhythmic snippets and melodic scribbles, most averaging a minute or less, <i>Ampexian</i> is in the tradition of the single-artist album as delirious self-constructed DJ set, many tracks combined into one flowing composition to discourage shuffle function tomfoolery. Even Prefuse's 2001 debut, the indelible <i>Vocal Studies and Uprock Narratives</i>, featured more sketches than songs, but <i>Ampexian</i> is built from stacked fragments of boom-bap and digital ambiance that would bounce right past your half-conscious ear when removed from their context, rather than two-minute interludes slid between traditional three- or four-minute grooves.</p>
<p>So, sure, you <i>could</i> sieve the nerve-jangling music-box miniature ""No Lights Still Rock"" for some personal playlist, but it's designed (presumably) to follow ""Simple Loop Choir"", an ultra-chill moment in love. Does this tapestry aesthetic pay off? Yes and no. ""No Lights Still Rock"", annoying in that overly antic way common to several generations of Warp Records artists, is a bomb dropped to disrupt the listener's reverie, but it comes off as an irritating intrusion rather than a mood-altering segue. That's obviously a problem when the goal is end-to-end enjoyment, with your fingers a comfortable distance from the skip button.</p>
<p>Unless you're making outright background music-- and <i>Ampexian</i> is too restless for that designation-- lack of flow is a cardinal sin when constructing an album that asks to be played first minute to last, especially in an era of endless easy distractions. And perhaps non-fans used to mixing and matching MP3s will suffer Herren's occasional sequencing missteps for the moments when that aforementioned melodic instinct makes him shoot for swoon-worthiness over laptop shock-and-awe. It's hard to imagine any Prefuse project fully abandoning agitation, the thrill of Herren's digital slicing and dicing. But the highlights of <i>Ampexian</i> suggest that if he did want to use the moniker for easier listening, the results would genuinely beguile, rather than demand your full attention and hope for the best.</p></div>"|12961.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12961-everything-she-touched-turned-ampexian/|6.5|Jess Harvell

Back in 2002,  Modeselektor's Sebastian Szary and Gernot Bronsert linked up with  Sascha Ring (Apparat) to lay down a collaborative full-length and, gently  put, it didn't work out. The trio found the recording process so personally  damaging they named the resulting material (which, tellingly, became  an EP) <i>Auf Kosten der Gesundheit</i> (""At the Cost of Health"").  Naturally it didn't seem like they'd be getting back together anytime  soon.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, the guys  decided to give it another shot (apparently a chance encounter  at the Berlin-Mitte City Pool sparked the reunion).  Still, on paper the collaboration doesn't seem like a cakewalk, mainly  because the two acts don't share much stylistic common ground. Modeselektor's  music is built on a combination of glitch, electro, and hip-hop thump  and it's all about thrust and action-- the art of dropping heavy  bass and making people go apeshit in a club. Apparat, meanwhile, tends  to look inward. He utilizes more conventional pop structures that are  wrapped in shoegaze synths and layers of atmosphere for something closer  akin to what M83 is doing these days.</p>
<p>Of course, it's this aesthetic  dissimilarity that makes the record an exciting prospect. And the good  news is that (for the most part) they pulled it off. Long stretches of <i>Moderat</i> find the three producers locked into a healthy creative symbiosis that  accentuates the best parts of their individual styles. The record's  best tracks, like first single ""A New Error"", illustrate the  balance. It bounces along with the muscular energy we expect out of  Modeselektor without ignoring the warm astral qualities of an Apparat  song. Others, such as standout ""Seamonkey"", pull off the same feat  with even more complexity. The song opens with a minute-plus of nasty,  walloping bass and just when you start to wonder if that's all there  is, it unfurls into something much more intricate.</p>
<p><i>Moderat</i> is generous  with moments like this-- tracks gather steam and reveal fresh layers  as they move forward-- and they're what make the record a captivating  listen. This is especially true of its more robust pieces. What opens as a minimal synth sequence on ""Les Grandes Marches"" becomes a vigorous  beat assault by song's end. ""Nr. 22""-- arguably the record's  finest cut and the best take on your standard build-and-release techno  I've heard in awhile-- starts out all silent and whispery before  a setting loose a hyperactive-synth and staccato-drum pattern sure to  strip paint off the walls of clubs from Berlin to Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Such club-ready moments split time with a variety of other styles ranging from gentle  atmospheric numbers to grime-inflected pop tracks. Most of them are  winners. Ring takes up vocal duties on ""Rusty Nails""  and ""Out of Sight"", a pair that most closely resembles his breakout  work with 2007's <i>Walls</i>. The difference here is that the shoegaze/dream-pop  structures that dominated that album are swapped out for stabs at dubstep. This might have came across as disingenuous trend-jacking  on lesser material, but Moderat's savvy enough to incorporate the  form in such a way that adds their own spin to it. (Even if, yeah, the  beats do owe <i>a lot </i>to Burial.)</p>
<p>The stretch between ""Slow  Match"" and ""Sick with It""-- where Modeselektor try their hand  at a few dancehall cuts-- is the only shaky portion of the album and could have easily been left on the cutting-room floor. And that's  the other thing: the record is too long. (Sandwiched between the reggae  numbers are the mostly ""meh"" ""3 Minutes of"" and ""Nasty Silence"".)  For one reason or another, Modeselektor seem unwilling to trim the fat (read any review of <i>Happy Birthday!</i> and the central criticism is always length) and here again, are a handful  of just-okay songs that probably should have been lopped off. Cut some  of them and you've got a great record instead of just a darn good  one.</p></div>"|12959.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12959-moderat/|7.6|Joe Colly

Yet even among this crowd, guitarist Jack Rose stands out as a musician with some particularly unusual habits. Whether as a solo performer, in his former group Pelt, or with his numerous other collaborators, Rose resolutely keeps his own counsel, as his music progresses from dilated abstract drones to the most devoutly traditional folk-blues exercises. Unlike most artists, however, Rose does not necessarily use his records as a means to introduce listeners to his newest material, but rather as a sort of milepost to indicate where his latest paths have lead him.</p>
<p>As a result of this quirky recording philosophy, Rose has shown a tendency to return time and again to reinterpret the same material, whether it be his own compositions or such vintage staples as Blind Willie Johnson's ""Dark Was the Night (Cold Was the Ground)"". Perhaps Rose attempts these revisions through a sense of perfectionism, but more often than not his investigations seem to simply derive from restless curiosity, as though his own songs were puzzles to be solved or knots he can't quite fully untie.</p>
<p>True to form, then, that in addition to a couple of new songs, Rose's latest album <i>The Black Dirt Sessions</i> contains several tracks that have appeared in other versions on previous records. The most notable of these is the epic ""Cross the North Fork"", a piece that Rose has recorded in three earlier variations. (Or maybe even more, since the Pelt track ""Up the North Fork"" from their 2003 release <i>Pearls From the River</i> seems to be at least a half-sibling.) And though this repetition might make one wish that Rose was more willing to branch out as a composer, his boundless expressive abilities help keep these pieces fresh and full of discovery.</p>
<p>On Rose's 2004 album <i>Raag Manifestos</i>, ""Crossing the Great Waters"" appeared as an energetic raga, and by 2005's <i>Kensington Blues</i>, it had morphed into the dense and exquisite ""Cross the North Fork"". Here the piece has become ever more drawn out and contemplative, like taking a leisurely stroll through an old, familiar neighborhood, with Rose taking care to savor every small detail. All of Rose's established influences are still in evidence-- stray elements of raga, ragtime, and the heavy echoes of the Takoma catalog-- but by this point they have been fully internalized, and Rose fills his playing with an easy, graceful authority.</p>
<p>At various points in his career, Rose's fondness for traditional forms has raised the temptation to dismiss him as a mere revivalist, and this was never more true than on last year's <i>Dr. Ragtime and His Pals</i>, a collection of roots-based material that may sound too conservative for fans of his more experimental work. Typically enough this criticism seems to have not concerned Rose in the slightest, and <i>The Black Dirt Sessions</i> includes three newly-altered versions of songs from <i>Dr. Ragtime</i>, and each seems a subtle improvement. On ""Fishtown Flower"" Rose goes for the full cowboy-saloon effect as he is joined by Hans Chew's jaunty ragtime piano, and on ""Song for the Owl"" he again displays his vibrant slide-playing skills.</p>
<p>One constant with Rose is that his albums have always been impeccably well-produced, and <i>The Black Dirt Sessions</i> is no exception. Recorded at Jason Meagher's Black Dirt Studio in Westtown, NY, the album ably captures every burr and spark from Rose's guitar and reliably rewards extended headphone play. Masterful though these performances are, however, with Rose one can never assume that these are intended to be definitive recordings, or whether he might not someday want to take yet another crack at these songs.</p></div>"|12901.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12901-the-black-dirt-sessions/|7.2|Matthew Murphy

To mark their china anniversary, the couple  are foregoing a retrospective of their seven studio albums (although  they're certainly due) in favor of a brand-new Family album, fittingly  titled <i>Honey Moon</i>. Rather than dwell on country gothic doom and  despair, they've recorded all manner of love songs-- odes to sex,  devotion, redemption, sacrifice, New Mexico, and more sex-- that are  only slightly sunnier than their usual fare. But don't expect corny  sentiments even from a song called ""Love Is Like"": Even commemorating  two decades together, they indulge the dark edges of these eccentric  and personal songs, as if love is all that keeps the abyss at bay. Love  is like, Brett sings, ""a black fly buzzing in the sun"" or ""the  hole torn right through the roof.""</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even at its most ruminative, <i> Honey Moon</i> sounds like a celebratory record, a document of the ups  and downs that define any marriage. As if responding to the airports  and strip malls of 2006's <i>Last Days of Wonder</i>, these new songs  are so full of woodsy imagery that they make Neko Case seem urbane.  The only modern edifices here are the pawnshops and neon signs on ""A  Thousand Diamond Rings"", and they are transformed into a romantic  setting by the ""watermelon light"" of the sun setting over the desert.  Nothing stands out as boldly as ""Weightless Again"" on <i>Through  the Trees</i> or ""Tesla's Hotel Room"" on <i>Last Days</i>, but  the lighter mood suits them sweetly.</p>
<p>""Darling my darling, look at my  waving antennae,"" sings Brett on ""Darling, My Darling"". There may  be a dick joke hidden in that opening line, but there's more Henry  Miller than Franz Kafka as the songs follows the man-as-bug metaphor  to its logical conclusion: ""I'll leap on your spine and love you  till you gnaw me down to my wings/ I'll give you everything."" That the  songs comes across as sweetly romantic and devoted until death-- as  opposed to either showy or creepy-- is a testament both to Rennie's  skillful threading of words into images and Brett's sensitive translation  of words on a page into vocals.</p>
<p>In the Handsome Family, Brett and Rennie  divide musical duties the way some couples assign household chores.  Blessed with a humble, hollowed-out-like-a-tree-trunk baritone, he does  most of the singing. An accomplished novelist and poet, she does most  of the songwriting. On <i>Honey Moon</i>, Rennie displays a typically  observant eye for the small details that become portentous with meaning:  A flock of birds beckons thoughts of escape, a sunset changes their  world for just a few minutes each day, and a cement mixer inspires existential  ponderings. Brett and the extended Family set her deep thoughts to sparse  arrangements with subtle animating flourishes like the dreamy 1950s  rock piano of ""Linger, Let Me Linger"", Dave Gutierrez's spidery  dobro on ""When You Whispered"", or Brett's hoarse whistle on ""The  Loneliness of Magnets"".</p>
<p>Interestingly for a group most commonly  associated with story-based songs, <i>Honey</i> <i>Moon</i> sheds all  narrative concerns for more descriptive language. Even ""When You Whispered"",  whose title implies a mystery about what exactly was whispered, is less  worried over the quiet verbal exchange than the scenery around them:  the wind on the bridge, the ripples of water beneath, the frogs on the  shore. The album is full of similar tableaux: These songs are dioramas  depicting the New Mexico wilderness as a reverberation of the couple's  desires.</p></div>"|12878.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12878-honey-moon/|7.2|Stephen M.

Unlike those previously mentioned groups, however, they've done it by exploring a more pastoral and rustic vein of songcraft rather than loft-ready noise. On their three previous albums-- released in limited editions on a variety of formats across a choice selection of micro-labels-- Woods created a distinctive blend of spooky campfire folk, lo-fi rock, homemade tape collages, and other noisy interludes, all anchored by deceptively sturdy melodies.</p>
<p>Woods' latest album, <i>Songs of Shame</i>, is their most cohesive collection, and it's not only quickly lifted them to front of the Woodsist crew but positioned them to be the group that appeals to those who've previously been uninterested in the 2008-09 crop of lo-fi. As with the best lo-fi albums, <i>Songs of Shame</i> performs some sleight-of-hand by sounding private and homespun yet also not just accessible but immediately lovable. Along the way, Woods can evoke any number of their lo-fi ancestors, from early Guided by Voices to the murkier depths of the Siltbreeze or Flying Nun back catalogs, but they're still able to retain their own immediately recognizable off-kilter character.</p>
<p>The group is centered primarily on the duo of Jeremy Earl (proprietor of Fuck It Tapes) and Jarvis Taveniere (Meneguar, Wooden Wand) and they've designed this record through an affinity for home recording and its attendant cassette culture. As befits an act with a somewhat befuddling discography, many of the recordings on <i>Songs of Shame </i>first appeared last fall on the tour cassette <i>Some Shame</i>. But even for the select few who've heard that release, these tracks have lost none of their charm. On the melodic ""Down This Road"" or ""Born to Lose"", Earl's vocals have a strange, slightly unhinged pitch, sounding something like a muffled Neil Young. Drums clatter in the distance as though buried behind drywall, and G. Lucas Crane occasionally adds discreet tape effects to the din. Meanwhile, forceful guitar solos zoom unpredictably in and out of the frame, hazily recalling a time when it seemed every band boasted at least one avid J Mascis aficionado.</p>
<div>
<p>Of course, it wouldn't be a Woods album without a few surprises. The most glaring example is the nine-minute guitar jam ""September With Pete"", which features a cameo from Magik Markers' Pete Nolan. Although the piece is solid and less jarring than some of Woods' past noise experiments, its position early on the LP somewhat dulls the album's momentum. Equally unexpected is another <i>Some Shame</i> holdover, a faithful cover of Graham Nash's ""Military Madness"", an earnest anti-war ditty that in Woods' hands sounds like Nash and Young strumming away in the treehouse while Crosby and Stills are forced to wait out in the car.</p>
<p>Mirroring the wistful tone of ""Military Madness"", the album closes with an especially potent trio of songs: ""Rain On"", ""Gypsy Hand"", and ""Where and <span class=""IL_LINK_STYLE"">What Are You</span>?"". The melancholic ""Rain On"" in particular is a near-perfect dusky gem, underlining the album's subtle themes of loss and disaffection. Despite Woods' humble production values and their fondness for living room ambiance, <i>Songs of Shame</i> has that almost subliminal ability to make one want to move in to listen more closely. And once you've been drawn in for a good listen, it becomes difficult not to want to come back for many more.</p>

Where the version of ""Troy"" on <i>The Lion and the Cobra</i> is lushly orchestrated, painting the story of desire and betrayal on a wall-sized canvas, O'Connor performed the song in concert alone on acoustic guitar. Despite the spare setting, every twist and turn the song takes is rendered even more dynamically on the strength of her singing, which gradually modulates from a soft whisper recalling better times to a hair-raising accusatory howl. At the song's climax, she screams into the microphone, her voice breaking into a million pieces: ""You're still a fucking liar!"". ""Harrowing"" is the only word that comes close to describing it.</p>
<p>Was it just theater? It's possible. Sure doesn't sound like it, though. The way O'Connor was singing ""Troy"" as the 1980s ended, you get the feeling that something had to change, and soon. Exposing yourself to people like that repeatedly, especially for someone carrying around cartloads of emotional baggage, someone with questionable judgment and a knack for doing ill-advised things in public, is a good way to end up deep trouble. Which she did. She had some tough years in the 90s, getting in hot water for refusing to allow the ""Star Spangled Banner"" to be played prior to a show in New Jersey, tearing up the Pope's picture on ""Saturday Night Live"", and having an onstage meltdown after being booed at a Bob Dylan tribute. Early O'Connor can now seem a model for a certain kind of feminine intensity in rock music, one that moves effortlessly between ethereality and fire-spitting. But for a while, all you wondered about was what controversy was going to dog her next.</p>
<p>Ironically, the album that thrust her into the spotlight, that place where all mistakes are amplified, hinted that she was destined for something else. There's just as much pain on display on<i> I Do Not Want</i> as there was on her debut, but O'Connor was growing up fast. She was starting to understand the concept of artistic distance, ways to transform the hurt into something more people could grasp. She was still writing from the gut, casting aside lyrical devices to say what's on her mind even if it didn't fit the meter of the song. But she started singing with restraint and nuance, allowing for an easier way in. So ""It seems like years since you held the baby/ While I wrecked the bedroom,"" from ""Emperor's New Clothes"", is delivered with a muted lilt, O'Connor's voice bright and possibly a little hopeful, confident in her strength despite the weight of the past. While ""Black Boys on Mopeds"", an anti-Thatcher (and anti-England) song, is ghostly and downcast, the voice and guitar expressing a sort of nurturing sadness instead of just rage.</p>
<p>For many, of course, the album will always be about ""Nothing Compares 2 U"", a cover of a song Prince had written years before for the Time offshoot the Family. Both the song and the simple and heartbreaking video are what O'Connor will always be remembered for, and with good reason: you have to look pretty hard to find a better expression in pop music of the void that exists when a relationship ends. And if nothing else on <i>I Do Not Want</i> rises to that level, almost nothing else on any other albums does either. Instead, the record is mostly quiet and folky, the voice-and-guitar ballads alternating with tracks like ""I'm Stretched on Your Grave"", which combines a traditional melody with the then-ubiquitous ""funky drummer"" beat, and ""Jump in the River"", which shows that O'Connor wasn't necessarily suited for writing upbeat songs you might hear on the radio.</p>
<p>And soon, she'd stop trying. The so-so bonus disc is fleshed out with songs that hint at where she'd go next. She'd try standards (Cole Porter's ""You Do Something to Me"", from the 1990 <i>Red Hot &amp; Blue </i>comp), imaginative covers of kindred spirits (here it's a decent take on John Lennon's ""Mind Games"", later it would be Nirvana's ""All Apologies""), and genre experiments (Gregory Isaacs' ""Night Nurse"" hinted at her reggae obsession). She became more of a quirky cult artist still capable of a brilliant song from time to time, which seemed to suit her much better. She also stopped performing ""Troy"" for almost 20 years, finally dusting it off in 2008 for a festival in Antwerp. There's a good <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyqvQVeVK9A"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouTube out there</a>. This time she was fronting a full orchestra, a middle-aged woman in bare feet and graying hair whose voice still had power. Last year's ""Troy"" is not nearly as raw as what was she was doing in her 20s, but it's reassuring, somehow, as it makes you glad for longevity. It seems like she's finally in control, having figured out how to perform the song instead of just channeling it.</p></div>"|12954.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12954-i-do-not-want-what-i-havent-got-limted-edition/|7.8|Mark Richardson

Thoughtfully, the War on Drugs' Kurt Vile has done this with his solo work via <i>Constant Hitmaker</i>'s  ""Classic Rock in Spring/Freeway in Mind"". See? Done. You know exactly how  that should sound-- as nostalgic, wistful,  and sunlit as the title suggests, with Vile crooning softly into a Jim James-sized  cavern of reverb over some finger-picked chords about ""riding on  your Yellow Schwinn and blasting classic rock in spring."" Those  are some mighty big signifiers for a twentysomething kid to be throwing  around, but Vile knows his way around them like they were living-room  furniture.</p>
<p>Kurt Vile (real name, no gimmicks) has seemingly absorbed a lifetime's worth of FM rock, and the ghosts of Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, and others glimmer under the surface of his woozy, homemade bedroom  pop. Vile recorded the majority of these songs on his own, and the sputter  of the cheap drum software and the murmuring vocals testify to the kind  of guy who doesn't want to wake up his parents upstairs. Nonetheless,  even in this sleepy, abstracted form, there is no mistaking the widescreen  Tom Pettyisms of ""Freeway"", from the wry hiccup of the vocal to  the sunshower of jangling guitars that accompanies the track. <i>Constant  Hitmaker</i>, his 2008 debut on Gulcher, snagged the ear of an attentive  few, and now it is being reissued along with <i>God Is Saying This To  You</i>, a limited edition LP, on vinyl. The sound of <i>God Is Saying  This To You</i> is slightly cleaner and clearer than the bleary, sound  effects-addled <i>Constant Hitmaker</i>, but that only means Vile sounds  like he's singing from the bottom of a mineshaft this time instead  of from the ocean floor. And it still feels like you're eavesdropping:  Vile delivers every line in an amiable mumble, the sort of voice you  use when you're humming something to yourself and only know every  other word: ""Hey girl, come on over, that'll be just fine. Two packs  of red apples for the ride home,"" he murmurs over and over again on  ""Red Apples"", and it sounds like the half-remembered chorus of some  John Mellencamp song.</p>

Thoughtfully, the War on Drugs' Kurt Vile has done this with his solo work via <i>Constant Hitmaker</i>'s  ""Classic Rock in Spring/Freeway in Mind"". See? Done. You know exactly how  that should sound-- as nostalgic, wistful,  and sunlit as the title suggests, with Vile crooning softly into a Jim James-sized  cavern of reverb over some finger-picked chords about ""riding on  your Yellow Schwinn and blasting classic rock in spring."" Those  are some mighty big signifiers for a twentysomething kid to be throwing  around, but Vile knows his way around them like they were living-room  furniture.</p>
<p>Kurt Vile (real name, no gimmicks) has seemingly absorbed a lifetime's worth of FM rock, and the ghosts of Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, and others glimmer under the surface of his woozy, homemade bedroom  pop. Vile recorded the majority of these songs on his own, and the sputter  of the cheap drum software and the murmuring vocals testify to the kind  of guy who doesn't want to wake up his parents upstairs. Nonetheless,  even in this sleepy, abstracted form, there is no mistaking the widescreen  Tom Pettyisms of ""Freeway"", from the wry hiccup of the vocal to  the sunshower of jangling guitars that accompanies the track. <i>Constant  Hitmaker</i>, his 2008 debut on Gulcher, snagged the ear of an attentive  few, and now it is being reissued along with <i>God Is Saying This To  You</i>, a limited edition LP, on vinyl. The sound of <i>God Is Saying  This To You</i> is slightly cleaner and clearer than the bleary, sound  effects-addled <i>Constant Hitmaker</i>, but that only means Vile sounds  like he's singing from the bottom of a mineshaft this time instead  of from the ocean floor. And it still feels like you're eavesdropping:  Vile delivers every line in an amiable mumble, the sort of voice you  use when you're humming something to yourself and only know every  other word: ""Hey girl, come on over, that'll be just fine. Two packs  of red apples for the ride home,"" he murmurs over and over again on  ""Red Apples"", and it sounds like the half-remembered chorus of some  John Mellencamp song.</p>

Many bands are retro-aware-- see Bigelf, as well as most of Black Math Horseman's labelmates on Tee Pee-- but few embody the past yet avoid merely wearing its clothes.  Retro awareness usually involves blinders to the present, which Black Math Horseman do not wear.  One school of thought says that everything that can be done has been done.  If so, Black Math Horseman have sharp filters.  They've funneled the best parts of rock's giants into a richly idiosyncratic entity.</p>
<p>Black Math Horseman = Led Zeppelin's bombast + Black Sabbath's rhythm section + 1970s psych rock dilation + Isis' minimal-maximal dynamics.  This is a horrible description, I know.  But when listening to <i>Wyllt</i>, it's impossible not to hear decades of record collecting riffling by.  Parts of ""Deerslayer"", for example, could have been on <i>Badmotorfinger</i> (Soundgarden chaneling Sabbath), <i>Ritual de lo Habitual</i> (Jane's Addiction channeling Zeppelin), and, of all things, <i>She Hangs Brightly</i>.  Sera Timms' mostly cool-tempered voice suggests Nico on 4AD, complete with ghostly reverb.  The gauzy ""Torment of the Metals"" recasts the Doors' ""The End"" as Krautrock.  But though this record was raised on radio, no cuts are obvious singles, especially with Timms haunting the back of the mix.  A college party soundtrack this is not.</p>
<p>For all the references this record evokes, it feels elusive.  The band seems like it's working from deep within its influences.  Songs are layered yet minimal.  No jam sections here-- every note is in its place.  The result is a studied diligence that's appealingly austere, yet frustratingly restrained.  Black Math Horseman have potent ingredients, but they cook them at a simmer.  That makes <i>Wyllt</i> a smooth listen, but it rarely boils over.  Most attempts to do so merely raise bubbles.</p>
<p>The one exception is ""Bird of All Faiths and None/Bell from Madrone"". This 11-minute behemoth closes the record with a vocal performance on par with early PJ Harvey.  Timms cuts through her reverb, sonorously elongating syllables, bending blue notes to the hilt, and howling with feral abandon.  Janis Joplin would approve.  Here, Black Math Horseman access the dark mojo of Black Sabbath; Timms accesses pure animality.  More like this, please.  Classic rock was scary once; Black Math Horseman could make it scary again.</p></div>"|12958.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12958-wyllt/|7.0|Cosmo Lee

Brooke Gallupe admonishes someone he deems is making a possibly risky social move: ""Don't build the bridge, if you don't want to let the riff raff over."" It's a sincere enough sentiment, but it also sets an precedent for the rest of the album. Gallupe has mostly taken over the reins of the band-- Calder provides background vocals and gets the spotlight on one song, ""You Destroyer""-- and the fruits of his solo stewardship, as represented on ""Bridge"", can leave a bit of a bitter taste, when they leave a taste at all.</p>
<p>If <i>Fables</i> was an angel on your shoulder whispering advice, about a third of <i>Jackson Hill</i> sits between the poles of doomsday forecasts and caustic reprimands. ""Sound the Alarms"" is an acoustic march led by Gallupe to warn anyone within earshot that ""we're at the dead end of everything,"" because his generation has lost all of its good ideas. Gallupe tells us on ""He's a Biter"" exactly where those ideas have gone: they're dead, having been ""bitten"" by ""downtown loft vampires."" ""Biter"", unsurprisingly, doubles as Gallupe's attempt to draw lines around appropriate aesthetic behavior. ""There are some who lead and some who make it look as though they've led,"" he teaches us, before striking out at those who ""Photoshop themselves into the credits when they can."" Perhaps a bit ironically, ""Biter"" is <i>Hill</i>'s most reverent bit of pastiche, a direct line to Marc Bolan's groovy <i>Slider</i>-period electric doo-wop. ""You Got Us Into This Mess"" could gloss on another album as a broad political statement, but here, a line like ""It could have gone my way on any other day"" is most likely very personal. And kind of selfish, too,  but not as much as ""Thank Me Later"", which broadcasts Gallupe's healthy egotism in its title alone.</p>
<p>Perhaps pungency is Gallupe's preferred register, because the rest of <i>Hill</i> isn't nearly as memorable. The rocker ""Neighbours Don't Mind"" and the nostalgic ""And It Was"" may be on opposite ends of the tempo spectrum, but they're united under a conservative register: partying in a bachelor apartment and dancing in a ""little old pub"" are <i>exactly</i> the things that Gallupe wants to save from scenester gentrification. But advocacy works worst when it passes by unnoticed, and none of the album's sentiment or craft sticks when it's not severe; <i>Hill</i>'s vinegar is, unfortunately, much stickier than its honey. Irony, or at least that's what I hope ""Only Love You For Your Car"" is, doesn't work well either: What Gallupe tries to pass as playful sarcasm is more a rhyme scheme cop-out: ""I only love you for your car/ It's a shame the way things are"". That bit does signal the biggest problem of <i>Jackson Hill</i>, a letdown after <i>Fables</i>; whether haughty, homesick, or ha-ha, on the way toward frankness, the album gets bogged down in simplicity.</p></div>"|12948.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12948-high-on-jackson-hill/|4.5|Eric Harvey

<p>He was 24. He was cute. He was smart, funny, and tender. Like a lot of great songwriters-- or writers, period-- he was as critical of his surroundings as he was enamored of them. He was also an entertainer, and it helped (from a marketing perspective) that his lines describing just how nigh the end is-- ""Forces of evil in a bozo nightmare/ Ban all the music with a phony gas chamber""-- doubled as the kind of kooky shit that casual, young radio listeners are powerless against. In the year of Kurt Cobain's suicide and the popular awakening of bands as indescribably bad as the Stone Temple Pilots, Beck wasn't just our ""consolation prize"" (as Spin's<i> 20 Years of Alternative Music </i>later called him)-- he was our escape hatch.</p>
<p><i>One Foot in the Grave</i>, out of print between 2005 and last week's merciful deluxe reissue, is a good companion to <i>Mellow Gold, </i>if not as essential on its own. Originally recorded for Olympia, Wash.'s stringently indie K Records (which spent the 80s tearing down the received image of the punk rockers and replacing it with research librarians and men who love embroidering), <i>One Foot </i>is Beck striking his most lo-effort, DIY pose-- one that fit not only into K's roster, but into an indie-music world where foot shufflers like Palace, Smog, and Pavement were getting traction. But it's also his personal take on Americana-- opener ""He's a Mighty Good Leader"" is a Skip James cover; the slide-guitar blues of ""Fourteen Rivers Fourteen Floods"" just sounds like one; and the folksy stasis of ""Sleeping Bag"" has more in common with Leonard Cohen than anything happening in the indie world. This is Beck, rustic. The guitars are not entirely in tune. His voice, removed from the matrix of samples and syncopations, sounds nasal and naïve.</p>
<p>But his worldview-- really, what made him something much bigger than a novelty act-- is beautifully articulated. While Beck's commonly cited forebears are the Beastie Boys and Bob Dylan, his real lineage was from sculptors like Robert Rauschenberg or Claes Oldenburg: guys who turned the unusable spillover of mass production-- ""trash,"" to the trash collector-- into art. If Warhol's soup cans had a crisp, almost optimistic feel, <a href=""http://www.digischool.nl/ckv2/bevo/kunstvakken2_2009/hoofdstuk5/oldenburg1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Oldenburg's hamburger</a> was a downer-- an unappetizing convenience that will, eventually, kill us. And <i>One Foot in the Grave</i> is the moment after we surrender to it: Tract homes and strip malls, a Midwest that the Hold Steady hadn't yet romanticized, the edges of Los Angeles County that money didn't whitewash-- all crushed, half-empty, a mess. It's just the trash and the couch and me and you.</p>
<p>What's seductive about this particular doomsday scenario-- i.e., what's not depressing or urgent, or even <i>meaningful</i>-- is that Beck sounds relaxed. (If nobody advanced the idea in 1994, when the word was inescapable, I submit that being a slacker-- if being a slacker means ""not caring about what's going on around me""-- is a form of peace, self-preservation, or maybe even enlightenment.) Every other song on <i>One Foot</i> juxtaposes a world burning down (or burned out) with sitting on one's ass. I could quote forever in support, but because this isn't a book report, I'll offer one line, my favorite, from ""I've Seen the Land Beyond"": ""There's no telling who'll be dead/ When the pale horse is turning red/ And the tongues will burn in vain/ And everything will feel the same.""</p>
<p>About half these jeremiads double as love songs, a form Beck didn't revisit in earnest again until 2002's <i>Sea Change</i>. While <i>SC</i> was unimaginatively billed as his ""mature"" album, I'm not sure that he was actually any more mature in 2002 than he was in 1994. True, the obvious ""relationship"" songs here-- ""Asshole"" (as in ""She'll do anything to make you feel like an"") and ""Girl Dreams"" (as in the ones that ""never come true"")-- lean on familiar (if funny) self-deprecation. But songs like ""Painted Eyelids"", ""It's All in Your Mind"", and ""Teenage Wastebasket"" (the latter two among the album's 16 bonus tracks) are careful, adoring, and sympathetic. (""Teenage Wastebasket"", of which we get two versions, plays like a dull slap in Neutral Milk Hotel's face: ""She is a teenage wastebasket/ Paddling up the river in a casket/ Trying to experience everything at least once/ Her life is a commercial for being fucked up."")</p>
<p>I'm not sure that remastering an album that was already lo-fi has done much good, and I'm not sure that the bonus material here is a revelation as much as, well, just a nice bonus. The best outtake, ""It's All in Your Mind"", was actually rerecorded for <i>Sea Change</i>, and it's obvious why the rest of the songs didn't make the final round. What <i>is</i> good is that <i>One Foot</i> ended up back in print. <i>Mellow Gold</i> eclipsed it (and <i>Stereopathetic</i>) entirely. In a sense, that's fine-- <i>Mellow Gold</i> was the best of the three. But I remember eagerly buying all three at once, and realizing later that what saved Beck from being a novelty artist was not only life <i>after</i> ""Loser"", but the life he'd already made around it.</p></div>"|12936.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12936-one-foot-in-the-grave/|7.8|Mike Powell

But it takes a master ironist to fall into mediocrity by embracing sincerity  and scoffing at dancefloor trends-- and Pet Shop Boys' frontman Neil  Tennant has built his career out of being a master ironist. That, it  turns out, is why the band's 10th studio album is such a disappointment.</p>
<p>On its surface, <i>Yes</i> isn't a significant departure from the style of the PSBs' better records--the  same highbrow witticisms (""Love etc"" is probably the first  U.K. chart single to namedrop artist Gerhard Richter), the same lavish  arrangements, Tennant's soft little voice cutting through the beats.  It allegedly features the duo's longtime collaborator Johnny Marr playing  on a few tracks, although most of the guitar parts are bland as paste  or all but inaudible or both. But the Boys have apparently forgotten  the great joke of their hits' production--that Tennant, despite having  one of the least robust male voices in pop history, had somehow ended  up singing on disco records--and the high concept of their public persona:  that Tennant put up an impressive front of arch, campy boredom to protect  the tenderest of hearts. To put it another way, the brilliance of their  cover of ""Always On My Mind"" was that they surrounded it with  a few dozen sets of ironic quotation marks, that they were formally  unequipped to support it in the manner to which it was accustomed, and  that they meant it anyway.</p>
<p>Here, though, Tennant slaps  his heart on his sleeve and gets on with things. The result isn't awful,  although none of it is as spooky and playful as the cover of the Passions  ""I'm In Love With a German Film Star"" that the Boys produced  for Sam Taylor-Wood last year. <i>Yes</i> has a few flashes of Tennant's  old wit, especially ""All Over the World"", which lifts its  biggest hook from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker March and describes itself  as ""sincere and subjective... superficial and true."" ""King  of Rome"" gets points for rhyming ""I couldn't be more lonely""  with ""someday you'll deign to phone me.""</p>
<p>On the other hand, ""Love  etc"" and ""Beautiful People"" are good arguments for an  immediate moratorium on wealthy pop stars writing songs about how materialism  is overrated and ""love is for free"" and it's stupid  to ""buy the latest magazine and aspire to the dream."" (You're <i> living</i> some version of the dream, guys.) And ""Building a Wall""  seems to be some kind of international-relations-as-personal-relations  metaphor, but doesn't take the conceit anywhere: Having come up with  a solid opening line for the chorus, Tennant simply repeats it.</p>
<p>The big source of stagnation  here, though, is the music. Tennant and other-guy-in-the-band Chris  Lowe made their reputation on paying attention to what was happening  in dance clubs and hitching their wit and pop-sense to it, which is  how they ended up collaborating with the likes of Bobby Orlando and  Frankie Knuckles and Shep Pettibone in the 1980s. <i>Yes</i>, though,  was produced by Xenomania, the pop chop-shop behind Girls Aloud's singles,  leaving the Boys lagging a few years behind the sound of the UK charts  when they used to be ahead of the game or at least above the fray.  ""Pandemonium"" recapitulates the 6/8 lope and major/minor switcheroo  of their own 1993 single ""Can You Forgive Her?"" The up-with-persons  anthem ""More Than a Dream"", co-written by Xenomania, just  sounds like a Girls Aloud discard. And the cryptic, bombastic slow one  that ends <i>Yes</i>, ""Legacy"", circles around the phrase  ""you'll get over it"". It's hard to tell if that's a tongue-in-cheek  valediction, or if it's just Tennant and Lowe resigning themselves to  disappointment.</p></div>"|12950.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12950-yes/|4.9|Douglas Wolk

Andy Hull, the barely-able-to-legally drink driving force behind Manchester Orchestra, is one such kid. He formed the band in the Atlanta suburbs in his junior year of high school, and the resultant album titles signal his desire to transcend his youth with verbiage: There's the purposefully paradoxical, mildly shocking, and certainly cheesy <i>I</i>'<i>m Like a Virgin Losing a Child</i>, or the 2005 EP <i>You Brainstorm, I Brainstorm, But Brilliance Needs a Good Editor </i>(apparently, album titles are excluded from said editing). <i>Mean Everything to Nothing</i>, the title of the band's latest and best-yet effort, tamps down the dramatics in favor of a pithy phrase drawn from the Young Existentialist's Handbook.</p>
<p>The emotions on <i>Everything</i> still run incredibly high, but the music has gotten much buffer, due no doubt to the band's relentless touring schedule over the past few years. The shift also owes something to the able hand of producer Joe Chiccarelli, who made the Shins sound arena-sized on <i>Wincing the Night Away</i> and manned the wayward ship of My Morning Jacket's <i>Evil Urges</i>, which for all of its ill-considered moves, still at least <i>sounded</i> great. In one interview last year, Hull called <i>Everything</i> ""<i>Pinkerton</i> on steroids,"" and while the latter is certainly true, opening track ""The Only One"" makes Manchester Orchestra sound a lot more like ""Kings of Leon's younger brothers.""  Like the Followill clan, Southern signifiers are packed tight amidst beefy riffs, with Hull's plaint that ""I'm the only son of a pastor I know who does the things I do"" substituting youthful angst for the brazen groupie-fucking of the Kings, themselves sons of a preacher man.</p>
<p>""The Only One"" opens a solidly rocking first half of <i>Everything</i>, on which the band builds a blazing bulwark of stadium-sized redneck-dread. On ""Shake It Out"", Hull's lyrics-- voiced in a half-shouted/half-sung timbre that should sound exceedingly familiar by now-- ride a dual-exhaust punk riff to a chorus that just barely stops itself from diving headfirst into hillbilly territory. The title ""I've Got Friends"" nods backward to <i>No Fences</i>, but Hull is far from sweeping onstage via zipline, wireless mic strapped to his head. On ""You, My Pride &amp; Me"", the band does an end-around the past 15+ years of emotionally-driven punk and plops down right in grunge territory. Hull may have been three when <i>Bleach</i> dropped, but his voice distantly channels a young and angry Kurt Cobain, and atop a dirge-like Black Sabbath cop to boot. When that monster riff hits, damn if I didn't yearn to pull out my nearly unplayable-for-a-decade-plus-of-scratches copies of Alice in Chains' <i>Facelift</i> and <i>Dirt</i>.</p>
<p>And that's a good thing. Hull may claim in interviews that Weezer and Neutral Milk Hotel (yes, you read that correctly) are major influences on his songwriting, but <i>Everything</i> works best in a Paleolithic rock register, instead of aiming for emo-trained ears. ""One Hundred Dollars"" attempts to merge Conor Oberst with Barrett Strong's ""Money (That's What I Want)"", and it's predictably awkward, and thankfully brief. It leads to a second half of <i>Everything</i> on which Hull is still high-strung, but his confusion is consistently tempered by varying degrees of revelation. On the midtempo ballad ""My Friend Marcus"", Hull tells the story of a friend who lives in his basement because ""his father touched more than spirit,"" while on the title track, he confesses, again in the convoluted, Yoda-esque register of a confused, bright kid, that ""Definitely, not the things that I'm seeing, did I think I'd see so instantly."" Phew-- for a kid barely able to legally drink, Hull's got the exhaustion of middle age. And that's the thing that both defines Manchester Orchestra at this point, as well as what stops them from being great. When they're satisfied with rocking the fuck out, they do it exceedingly well, but when they try to acquire the adult answers, they'd do well to chill out and enjoy being young.</p></div>"|12944.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12944-mean-everything-to-nothing/|5.2|Eric Harvey

On the last album from the Curtains, another of his former bands, Cohen finally wrangled his Pandora's box of ideas into structured songs, and the group's growth smacked of something like developmental biology. Founded with singer Nedelle Torrisi, Cryptacize prods Cohen into more ""adult"" territory, though the group's debut still evinced cringe-worthy cuteness in songs like ""Cosmic Sing-a-long"", which contained the mantra ""Every note is an unfinished song."" Considering Cohen's penchant for penning so much loose, unfinished-sounding material, that's a tough ethos to get behind. Fortunately, <i>Mythomania</i> resurrects the gravitas Cohen contributed to <i>The Runners Four</i> while also retaining a childlike sense of wonder.</p>
<p>Conjuring the sounds of the 1960s and 70s has always been Cohen's bread and butter, but on <i>Mythomania</i> the interpretation carries more weight. While Curtains and Crypticize's debut <i>Dig That Treasure</i> mostly espoused an eerily upbeat, almost cult-like take on psych rock, shit feels realer here. <i>Mythomania</i> isn't holding hands and drinking Kool-Aid, it's tripping on acid and pondering the great questions of the cosmos. Listening to ""Galvanize""'s chilly space operatics or the moody windmill guitar strumming on ""The Loving Sun"" recalls the moments on Cohen-era Deerhoof albums where the band's classic rock side gushed out, revealing a subconscious desire to make another <i>Led Zep II</i>.</p>
<p>Not to be outshined, Torrisi logs a commendable effort in her expanded vocal role. The slithering melodies on ""Tail &amp; Mane"" and ""Blue Tears"" capture The Zombies and Love at their most infectious, though not without throwing the listener a fair share of necromantic curveballs. Even the title track's saccharine verse is salvaged by a killer refrain, a twee-like acuteness that the band's previous material lacked. The normally phlegmatic Cohen offers moments of poignancy, too, most notably on the pretty phenomenological crisis ballad ""What You Can't See Is"". (Its opening line ""Part of me/ You're only seeing part of me"" is the album's tenderest moment.)</p>
<p>Finding unique ways to handle empty space and unorthodox arrangements has always been Cohen's greatest strength, and here that skill helps to mottle his most straightforward material to date. <i>Mythomania</i> isn't without its dry patches, but the orchestration never resorts to the same trick twice, but rather props up the album's more mediocre pop tunes. That's a far cry from the wonky sound collages that plagued early Curtains albums, and an indication that the group, with its members seemingly crawling into new shells every few months, has finally found a habitat to do some of that artistic maturing we're always not-so-secretly hoping for.</p></div>"|12939.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12939-mythomania/|7.0|Adam Moerder

The New York-by-way-of-Georgia act evokes both Dwight Yoakam and Steve Earle in the half-twangy, half-grizzled voice of its lead singer, Joseph Plunket, and proffers sloppy southern-friend grooves to match. Of course, even a style as seemingly unschooled and off-the-cuff as the Weight's is still a style, and the band's shambling insouciance paradoxically can feel just as contrived as any more obviously fussed-over assembly-line C&amp;W.<i></i></p>
<p><i>Are Men</i> shambles out of the gate with the drunk shuffle of ""Like Me Better"", and right away it's easy to get sucked in by the band's compelling aesthetic charms. Plunket has the kind of perfect country voice that's suffused with knowing heartache yet somehow still sounds effortlessly seductive, and the band behind him comfortably digs into a variety of tempos and styles. ""Had It Made"" coolly deploys a Chuck Berry waddle while the harmonica-driven ""A Day in the Sun"" explicitly mines the Stonesy blues-rock that's always lurking within this kind of music. ""Johnny's Song"" and ""Hillbilly Highway"" hold tantalizing teases of pedal steel and fiddle, respectively, and ""Closer Than a Friend"" tosses out a few ""ooh la la la""s straight from <i>Rubber Soul</i> for good measure.</p>
<p>You'll notice a few very familiar names in the preceding paragraph, and that's part of the problem. These are exhaustively charted waters the band is navigating, and the sheer predictability of these moves can be numbing no matter how smoothly they're handled. A spark of wit or insight or even honest self-examination from Plunket's pen would have been greatly appreciated as well, but unfortunately he's mostly content to play the role of unflappably cool yet unspeakably damaged heartbreaker here, feigning hurt for anonymously hopeless girls with a depressing lack of real empathy. ""Hillbilly Highway"" and ""Evergreen"" boast their share of bucolic charms, and ""Had It Made"" offers a crowd-pleasing litany of Southern city names that brings to mind Wilco's ""Monday"", but those efforts are undercut by the churlish likes of ""Sunday Driver"" and ""Closer Than a Friend"", groupie-weary songs that remind you what a marvel Okkervil River's ""On Tour With Zykos"" really was.</p>
<p>To be a real rebel or outlaw and not just an immaculately disheveled pretender, you've got to be willing to risk looking like an ass, to risk saying something embarrassing or unpleasant, to deliberately put yourself outside your own comfort zone. Steve ""Let's Empathize with an American Terrorist"" Earle and Dwight ""Sure, I'll Cover Queen in a Gap Commercial"" Yoakam have utilized these principles in fashioning iconic careers. For the sake of comparison, hold The Weight's achievements up against those of another former Athens denizen, Jason Isbell. The latter clearly follows his own stubborn muse no matter what uncool roads or emotionally unflattering avenues it makes him follow. It's an example the Weight's wasted miles of style would be wise to emulate.</p></div>"|12828.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12828-are-men/|4.9|Joshua Love

Even if one were to agree with that blithe assessment, there's no way Depeche Mode could be dismissed as <i>just</i> a singles band, given their track record on the charts and in the clubs, a string of hits that have hung in there to varying degrees of ubiquity. Sure, the singles sometimes remain standouts, but the rest of the tracks-- especially on albums like <i>Music for the Masses</i> and <i>Violator</i>-- are hardly filler. For better or for worse-- and those who miss the band's more subversive early days may think it's for the worse-- Depeche Mode have gotten in the habit of crafting complete start-to-finish statements.</p>
<p>Yet it's still unclear where Depeche Mode fits into today's pop world. The group is currently selling out stadiums around the globe, which attests to its ongoing popularity, and unlike many other acts of its vintage still manages to attract fans that span demographics. But Depeche Mode are also a far cry from the pioneers they once were, let alone the leaders they grew to become. It's almost as if the band has stepped aside to a parallel track, content in its place; more cachet, more cool, more money-- they'll take it if they can get it, but they sure don't need it.</p>
<p>So, yes, the days of earth-quaking, Zeitgeist-shifting Depeche Mode awesomeness may likely be behind them, but that doesn't make <i>Sounds of the Universe</i> any less worthy of the band's legacy. If the album as usual seems to have little or no bearing on anything outside the group's own, um, universe, the wheels and gears are definitely still turning and churning in the Depeche Mode machine. Martin Gore can still be counted on to deliver the goods, and recent songwriting convert Dave Gahan is impatiently nipping at his heels. Gahan's singing, meanwhile, is as strong as ever, always the perfect vehicle for Gore's lyrics, and the glue that holds together even the disc's most diffuse songs.</p>
<p>And really, <i>Sounds of the Universe</i> is, at 60 minutes and 13 songs-- the group's longest player to date-- relatively loose and sprawling, as likely to drift as hit hard. While the group's brought back producer Ben Hillier, <i>Sounds of the Universe</i> is a very different album from its predecessor, <i>Playing the Angel</i>. ""In Chains"" begins like how one imagines it would feel to be on the receiving end of a SETI signal before stretching into an epic-- satisfyingly dramatic and dynamic despite its leisurely seven-minute gait-- and deceptively full of activity despite what feels like an intentional ear for minimalism. ""Hole to Feed"", a Gahan composition, is similarly busy yet spare, bounding along a sci-fi take on the Bo Diddley beat while Gahan (his troubled history public record) draws on double meanings and innuendo to project the band's trademark narcissistic portent.</p>
<p>The song doesn't know how to end, but that just makes the entrance of ""Wrong"" that much more theatrical. That song-- the single-- is short but deliciously sour, hearkening back to the band's synthier days without losing the layer of grunge it's carefully cultivated post-<i>Violator</i>, a strategy also reflected by ""Fragile Tension"" (which wouldn't have been out of place on the generally noisier <i>Angel</i>). ""Little Soul"" and ""In Sympathy"", however, once again echo old-school minimalist Depeche menace and pop smarts, respectively, which makes ""Peace""-- sounding like Kraftwerk gone dreamy gospel-- that much more striking. It's a stirring encapsulation of all of Depeche Mode's different sides and qualities, reminiscent of all those other great album tracks lurking throughout the group's catalog.</p>
<p>Yet a funny thing happens next. With the strong but still oddly static Gahan composition ""Come Back"", the album starts to feel a little fractured, and by the time the effortlessly melodic ""Perfect"" comes around, followed by the casually industrial ""Miles Away/The Truth Is"", the synth-lounge ""Jezebel"", and the fuzzy  closer ""Corrupt"", it's almost as if we've embarked on another album entirely. Either that or the band's simply left us to find our way through their space. Ending with a brief, queasy reprise tease of ""Wrong"", <i>Sounds of the Universe</i> concludes anticlimactically, an echo of its promising start.</p></div>"|12940.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12940-sounds-of-the-universe/|6.3|Joshua Klein

And yet, here we are, a <i>decade</i> removed from <i>The Slim Shady LP</i> and before even selling one record, MC Asher Roth has generated opinions so ingrained one way or the other that for all intents and purposes, his debut album, <i>Asleep in the Bread Aisle,</i> might as well be a blank disc. There are those who celebrate the chance that <i>any</i> new artist becomes able to move units, even if he's being marketed to white, affluent hip-hop buyers seeking to relate to a rapper in a completely non-allegorical sense. And then there are those who've heard ""I Love College"" and find the use of hip-hop as a vehicle to express leisure class privilege as a bit... troubling, to say the least. Beyond that, ""I Love College"" is seen as a mutant strain of hipster-rap that completely evolved into frat-rap in the literal sense. And let's face it, you probably haven't heard ""frat"" used as a word to positively describe a lot of music since Otis Day &amp; the Knights.</p>
<p>I don't know about myself, man. If he wasn't a star-in-the-making and I wasn't some hatin' ass hater, I bet Asher Roth and I would probably get along. We both had Jewish upbringings in the same part of Pennsylvania. <i>Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life</i> was a formative listening experience for each of us. He too likes Butterscotch Krimpets. And I've had an easy go of things, really-- I fucking <i>loved</i> college. Then again, my memories might not be so fond if I was subjected to hearing ""I Love College"" and the rest of <i>Asleep in the Bread Aisle</i> at every party for the next four years, give or take a semester or three.  I'll probably only get to say this once, but frat boys deserve better.</p>
<p>Topicality isn't a sticking point, especially when hip-hop is almost always richer for having pioneers who are willing to shatter preconceptions of what it's ""okay"" to rap about-- see Eminem and Kanye, the 21st century's biggest stars and two rappers who set the stage for Roth's career in their own way. And surely, <i>someone</i> can be the William Styron of this rap shit, writing vividly about college parties, so ripe for exploration from a keen eye with its pungent sensory overload-- the smell of a beer-sticky basement, the sobering chill of a bleary walk home, the fact that any pizza joint that sells a slice for a buck is probably a drug front. Instead, and maybe this is the point, by trying to embody a universal experience, Roth reps for no one in particular and just becomes that asshole yelling ""CHUG, FRESHMAN!"" turning in the most laughably out-of-touch account of campus culture since <i>I Am Charlotte Simmons</i>. At least Tom Wolfe had the excuse of being 50 years older than Roth.</p>
<p>I wouldn't harp on ""I Love College"" if it wasn't so indicative of the hedge-betting callowness that defines the rest of the record. In his haste to blend in and not offend any of the bigwigs he's got in his corner, Roth paradoxically confirms the prejudice that maybe those in his position really <i>don't </i>have anything to say. Most of the time, particularly on ""Lark On My Go-Kart"", he revels in rapid-fire ""Family Guy""-style references that become failed jokes-- in the first verse alone, he's already namedropped Teddy Ruxpin, Little Miss Muffet, blumpkins, Kelly Kapowski, and Lark Voorhies. And for what? More often, even topics that are more germane to the listener lack any detail that could take them past mere talking points-- relationships are a hassle (""Be By Myself"", featuring a putrid Cee-Lo hook), the rap game is a struggle (""La Di Da""), the government's probably up to something (""Sour Patch Kids""). Even the most specified tracks fail miserably, yet differently: Not that either event is his fault, but in light of Nick Adenhart's tragic death and Andy Reid's drug-addled son getting busted in a parking lot 20 minutes from where Roth grew up, advocating smoking marijuana while operating a motor vehicle (""Blunt Cruisin'"") is tough to swallow even before its slapdash, annoying composition puts the listener in the sober mindset of a designated driver with a long night ahead of him.</p>
<p>Yeah, the beats-- they're pretty good. Not everything's as elephant walk-obvious as ""I Love College"", but there's a dusty, rock-oriented sound to a lot of these that could draw comparisons to Danger Mouse or Edan's <i>Beauty and the Beat </i>if anyone still listened to it. You're not here for those. Maybe you're here for the record's sole line of defensive, ""As I Em"", in which Roth raps <i>exactly </i>like Eminem (to the point of mania) and then complains about interviewers having the nerve to ask him about it.  Bubba Sparxxx made a similar lament during the last verse of ""Nowhere"", but his point hit home-- unlike Roth, he was a vet by that point, and he did so at a time when literally finding the next Eminem was something major labels actually did (hold your heads, Haystak and Lil Wyte). That and he also had Timbaland, whereas Roth's brothers in arms are talentless Perez Hilton-heads Chester French, whose whole career is owed to Vampire Weekend and MGMT not having gone to state schools. It's here where this entire internet-bubble beta-male rap game reveals how far up its own ass it is: Roth is defending himself against backlash, second-album ""I've seen some shit""-style, before <i>anyone cared enough to start it.</i></p>
<p>Of course, Roth has an army of bloggers hungry for a piece of that A&amp;R action, and they insinuate any dismissal of Roth is borne out of self-loathing. And yet the only rapper willing to be on the same track with the guy is legendary hermit Busta Rhymes, who shows up on the double-time showcase ""Lion's Roar"" and still exhibits some phoned-in dominance of his host. Surely these aren't guys who'd cosign on a weak artist in the interest of commerce! Why can't you ride for his cause? But it's not a self-loathing thing, and it's not a race thing-- <i>Asleep </i>feels less like an album of music meant to entertain than an assumption that you can actually bump a marketing plan in your cars and house parties. Whether or not Asher Roth is some sort of sign that hip-hop is dead, there's no doubt that he's proof that the music industry is still very much alive.</p></div>"|12931.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12931-asleep-in-the-bread-aisle/|2.4|Ian Cohen

When the job market's as dry as an Arizona ditch in August and flour canisters start subbing for IRA accounts, consumption historically trends towards confections, cosmetics, and calamity narratives. I'll let economists and <i>Adbusters</i> types unpack the first two, but the last needs no explaining: Even without 20-foot high billboard titles like ""All the Money I Had Is Gone"" and ""The Sun Never Shines"", banjos, fiddles, and twangy vocals just plain old holler HARD TIMES. More important, country music's accoutrements signal the inclusive, populist sentiment that <i>we're all in this mess together-- </i>even when the actions of hedge fund managers and insurance company executives say otherwise. Put it this way: When the Coen brothers wanted to gently mock earnest Depression-era social realism while also acknowledging that capitalism indeed co-opts everything in its path, including music and misery, they used ""old-timey"" ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" as shorthand.</p>
<p>I doubt it's an intentional act of class warfare, but with the release of their third full-length album, <i>Winter Hours</i>, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, alt-country band Deep Dark Woods could hit cultural paydirt. As <i>Winter Hours'</i> warm and fully fleshed string arrangements, quaint subjects and syntax, and willingness to let its bluegrass hang out (particularly on ""Nancy"" and ""As I Roved Out"") imply, the quartet isn't especially shy of the ""country"" part of that taxonomy or, despite coming from rock backgrounds, anxious to prove their ""alt"" credentials. And harmony-heavy, traditional-sounding folk is having its moment. Venn diagram the record collections of Deep Dark Woods and Pitchfork's 2008 album list topper Fleet Foxes and you'd round up a sizeable stack of Neil Young, Gram Parsons, and the Band LPs. But while Fleet Foxes have taken their influences and crafted them into pretty, abstract musical excursions and ahistorical hymns to nature, Deep Dark Woods work the material, storytelling aspects of the tradition. <i>Winter Hours</i> abounds with ballads about small mistakes swollen large, petty misunderstandings never mended, poverty, heartbreak, death, and a whole lot of wandering in the wilderness. (The album's only public-domain standard, ""When First Into This Country"", pretty much nails all of those in one whack.)</p>
<p>""All the Money I Had Is Gone"" is the album's standout, a gentle highway-strip-tracing pedal steel and banjo number in which a self-described ""wayward son"" calls out ""All the greedy hands/ That live around this land"" and also admits his part in his penurious position. Strike any chords? Singer and primary songwriter Ryan Boldt's steady tone is mournful but not maudlin, as he recounts disasters in ""The Gallows"", ""Two Time Loser"", and ""Farewell"", the album's counter-intuitively titled lead track about marriage and murder. Despite some Pinetop Seven-recalling gothic textures (""The Birds on the Bridge"", written by bassist Chris Mason, is a sinister paean to paranoia) and jam-banding noodles (""The Sun Never Shines""), Deep Dark Woods-- particularly Boldt-- keep emotions tightly wrapped, opaque. This is both to the album's advantage and detriment. Storytelling needs a narrator, preferably a reliable, sympathetic one that's easy on the ears, but it also needs a strong voice capable of venting horror, frustration, sadness, anger, outrage. And god knows we've got enough to be outraged about these days.</p></div>"|12879.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12879-winter-hours/|7.3|Amy Granzin

When things get intense, he nods his head approvingly; when he cuts loose, his foot will tap. Whether or not that cliché is accurate (Dear couple dancing near the stage at the Beirut show in D.C.: Thank you. Sincerely, Stephen), Still Flyin' exists seemingly to combat that image and those social reservations: A multinational party band based out of San Francisco but claiming members from as far away as Norway and Australia, the group infuses every moment of its full-length debut, <i>Never Gonna Touch the Ground</i>, with movement-- skittering beats, elastic basslines, snappy guitar riffs, ecstatic sing-alongs, all with the goal of making their audiences uncross their arms and maybe even dance. Sometimes Still Flyin' come across as over-evangelical in this tacit mission, sounding either maniacally insistent or dopily precious, but you can't say they aren't trying.</p>
<p>Back in 2004, Sean Rawls, formerly of Athens, Ga., outfits Masters of the Hemisphere and Je Suis France, created Still Flyin' as a loosely defined jam band, and its constantly mutating line-up has included musicians who spend their day jobs in the Aislers Set, Rafter, Maserati, Love Is All, and Architecture in Helsinki. Because of the choir of female back-up singers punctuating Rawls' lead vocals, Still Flyin' will no doubt draw comparisons to the Polyphonic Spree or I'm From Barcelona, and because of its liberal use of white-guy reggae beats, the band may be lumped in with 311 and Matisyahu. They're cool with being uncool, though. What makes <i>Never Gonna Touch the Ground</i> so intriguing, however, isn't any one aspect like vocals or beats, but the entire overstuffed package.</p>
<p>Just as the band gathers members from all over the world, so too does it draw influences globally. Afropop guitars twist and coil throughout ""Forever Dudes"" and ""Good Thing It's a Ghost Town Around Here"", while ""Dead Memory Man"" and ""Aerosmith Take Me... to the Other Side"" politely skank on reggae and ska beats. Shout-outs to Eddy Grant's ""Electric Avenue"" and Lipps Inc.'s ""Funky Town"" jostle elbows with nods to Swedish pop and show-tune punk, and it's all channeled through a North American indie sensibility, although one self-aware enough to counter knowingness with an exuberance bordering on silly. If <i>Never Gonna Touch the Ground</i> is Up With People covering Broken Social Scene, then some of these sing-alongs may be too complex to sing along with. That doesn't stop ""Good Thing It's a Ghost Town Around Here"" from unpacking its hooks one by one, each a little catchier than the previous. And ""The Hott Chord Is Struck"" spells out part of its title like cheerleaders at a pep rally. They got spirit.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that free-bird sensibility also means there are some dead-end interstitials during which Still Flyin' actually do touch the ground. Ten years ago, ""Act of Jamming"" would have been a hidden track on this CD, but it gets prime placement immediately following ""Ghost Town"". That's not progress. It's a half-assed half-groove that starts with a bass line straight out of a Stax revue, but doesn't build to anything at all. ""Haunted Houses"" in particular is a soggy gospel about the visceral joys of horror movies, yet its slack pace and dull sense of import communicate no such thrills. If <i>Never Gonna Touch the Ground </i>is less a party album and more an album as party-- self-contained, relentlessly upbeat, rowdy, self-celebratory-- too many of these songs come across as kegs of near beer.</p></div>"|12932.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12932-never-gonna-touch-the-ground/|6.0|Stephen M.

All of which only serves to highlight <i>Kicks</i>' comparable lack of laughs,  spontaneity, and ease. Frankly, though, even if listeners could wipe  their collective memories clean of <i>Cookies</i>' legacy, this album would be hard to distinguish  from the throng of other UK-based bands storming our shores armed with  herky-jerky guitar riffs, modish 1970s punk influences, and skinny-tie  strut. Which doesn't mean that <i>Kicks</i> is a bad album, just that  it's an indistinct one.</p>
<p>In fairness, there are still some great  songs here. Even when his jagged sound has been buffed  to an unnecessarily glossy sheen, frontman Jackie McKeown has an acerbic tongue and  a percussive sense of melody that can't be blunted by overproduction.  ""Vondelpark"", the album opener that chronicles a pot-fueled trip  to Amsterdam, makes stoner tourism sound funky. And with its psychedelic  guitar solos, the track gives a self-aware wink to the hippie-ish musical  styles so associated with its lyrical content. It should come as no  surprise that the two songs that are credited solely to McKeown-- ""Kickstrasse""  and ""Everybody Please Relax""-- are the best of the bunch. The former,  a sassy swagger of oversexed vocals and overheated distortion, represents  1990s luxuriating in their Rolling Stones fandom, complete with some  disco/R&amp;B backing vocals (courtesy of Long Blonde Kate Jackson)  and hints to classic American soul songs (namely ""Respect"").   The latter-- an ode to L.A. replete with Scientology references and  dreamy, bright 60s pop allusions that break through the glammy guitar  chug like the California sun through the clouds-- makes the best use  of McKeown's sharp wit and pop culture acumen.</p>
<p>Still, on too much of  the album the band's charismatic leader is content to share his spotlight,  ceding vocal duties to both of his bandmates on half of the album's  12 tracks, and relinquishing songwriting responsibilities completely  to bassist Dino Bardot on two of the record's most lethargic and corniest  songs (""Local Science"" and ""Sparks""). 1990s shouldn't be penalized  for embracing a more communal creation process-- it's nice to see  a group trying to move beyond being seen as just the project of a captivating  frontman and his sidemen-- but the fact is, these growing pains are  audible.</p>
<p>Perhaps, like fellow Glaswegians Franz  Ferdinand (with whom 1990s share a common lineage-- sneering pop-punk outfit Yummy Fur included members of both groups), this band  will follow this misstep of a sophomore album with a revitalized third  one. And perhaps time is all this trio needs to revamp their sound into  something fun again. Because <i>Kicks</i> is not the follow-up that <i> Cookies</i> deserved, but its handful of winning standout tracks also  suggests that its predecessor wasn't simply a fluke.</p></div>"|12886.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12886-kicks/|4.9|Rebecca Raber

As usual, she's being sincerely ironic. Camera Obscura fans will be pleased to know that she's still turning out maudlin torch songs with apparent ease. It is a record of the most immoderate sentiment: Thirty seconds in, on ""French Navy"", you've already got a dusty library, a French sailor, and the moon on the silvery lake. By the second track, ""The Sweetest Thing"", Campbell's ready to trade her mother for a compliment from a certain someone. She might not <i>want </i>to be sad again, but judging from the kind of tangled romantic assignations she confesses to here? Album number five already lurks in the inevitable fallout.</p>
<p>The sonic similarities and early connections between Camera Obscura and fellow Glaswegians Belle and Sebastian have already been flogged to death; what's less often mentioned is that they're also growing up parallel. Both began as lo-fi indie-pop bands with heads full of classic pop radio. Over time, both shifted their emphasis toward crafting classic-sounding songs in various Western pop idioms while retaining traces of their button-badge origins. More timid incarnations of Camera Obscura dissolved their genre exercises into a sort of equalizing cuddliness; on <i>My Maudlin Career</i>, the band's confidence draws them into sharper relief. You'll hear traces of 1950s beach music on ""The Sweetest Thing"", country on ""Forest and Sands"", and bubbly orch-pop all over the place. The album feels as if it could have been released any time in the last 50-odd years, but the inspired arrangements-- and, of course, Campbell's indelible voice-- make it sound fresh, too.</p>
<p>""Refinement"" is the watchword on <i>My Maudlin Career</i>, and there are two particular developments of note. One is the string arrangements, which are kinda out of control. They buffet the verses relentlessly, taking over entirely whenever the jubilation reaches such a feverish pitch that words can no longer express it-- check out the deliriously up-swirling end of ""Careless Love"". It's as if George Gershwin stormed the studio. A weaker band might have floundered under the weight, which brings us to the second notable development: Campbell's singing retains its vulnerable-but-tough naiveté, but it sounds more assertive and agile, with increased swing and soul, than ever before. There are still melodies of heart-wrenching simplicity that stick in your head to an almost irritating degree (beware of the dangerously catchy ""James""), balanced by songs with longer, more complex and limber melodic phrases. It's a singing style one wants to call ""mature.""</p>
<p>And maturity is a central concept to Camera Obscura-- Campbell's found it in her singing, but in her lyrics, the search continues. The asymmetries in her personality give her songs their distinct character. She still has that bitingly sarcastic, even cynical side, which lends a flinty edge to the sentimentality. Even in an adoring ode to a sailor boyfriend, she takes a moment to derisively mention his ""dietary restrictions."" And on the rollicking ""Swans"", you can practically hear her rolling her eyes when she sings, ""So you want to be a writer? Fantastic idea!"" Sarcasm seems to be a defense mechanism for Campbell, one that's necessary because of two very pronounced and conflicting personality traits. On one hand, she's a hopeless romantic. On the other, she's very cautious, and somewhat pessimistic. These contrary impulses create the tragically beautiful situations in her songs.</p>
<p>The fear of getting lost crops up frequently-- at least twice on this album. So does the fear of public opinion, which rears its head on ""French Navy"": ""I'll be criticized for lending out my art/ I was criticized for letting you break my heart."" Campbell is striving for equilibrium in adult relationships but keeps falling back into teenage predicaments. Her meditations on maturity, responsibility, and healthy love give the record its darker, more serious overtones. On ""Away with Murder"", over sullen minor-key organs, she contemplates the point where support shades into enabling: ""How many times have you told me you want to die?"" The question of what we owe the people we love, and what we can reasonably expect from them in return, is the backdrop for all the romance and depression. People are always showing up at Campbell's door when she doesn't want them to, or not showing up when she does. Being beholden in this way seems to frustrate and attract her in equal measure. Luckily for us, until this schism is resolved, her maudlin career should continue to play out apace.</p></div>"|12942.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12942-my-maudlin-career/|8.3|Brian Howe

Of course they do. Tramps like former Art Brut tourmates Hold Steady were born to run around wearing baseball jerseys in front of Counting Crows fans (and good for them!). <span>Art</span> <span>Brut</span> were born to lose: How could they ever improve on the clumsy meta-punk rush of their first single, ""Formed a Band""? They arrived almost fully formed. They never got to play ""Top of the Pops"". When they miraculously came up with another 11 songs just about as good-- or, in the case of ""Emily Kane"", arguably better-- on their brilliant 2005 debut album, <i>Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll</i>, it only added sting to their inevitable defeat. They were even losers at being losers. I loved them for it.</p>
<p>That's partly why it's so strange now to read reviews that lump <span>Art</span> <span>Brut</span> in with more commercially successful UK bands such as Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand. At live shows, lead not-quite-singer Eddie Argos used to change ""I can't stand the sound of the Velvet Underground"" to ""I can't stand the sound of Gang of Four,"" and I always assumed his targets were obvious (hint: neither the Velvet Underground nor Gang of Four). Full of fist-pumping but self-mocking bar-punk about obsessive fandom and romantic awkwardness, <i>Bang Bang Rock &amp; Roll</i> was the closest our decade has come to <i>The Modern Lovers</i>. <span>Art</span> <span>Brut</span>'s true peers are lyrical music geeks like John Darnielle, Jeffrey Lewis, Jens Lekman, Los Campesinos!, the Tough Alliance, and, most recently, Nodzzz. It's not irony; it's self-aware sincerity.</p>
<p>Good news for people who love losers: Art Brut's third album is on what Kanye might call ""some Benjamin Buttons shit."" Gone is the slight maturation of their good-- but, sadly, not great-- sophomore album, 2007's <i>It's a Bit Complicated</i>, which tried to win by the attractive-people rules of polished production; the songs were still warm, witty, and alive, but they just didn't have the original's ""I've seen her naked-- TWICE!"" brashness. Recorded on the fly with fellow Jonathan Richman acolyte Frank Black, <i>Art Brut vs. Satan</i> is a scrappy, romantic, and painfully hilarious return to loserdom. Coldplay will always be more popular. So what? I hate those guys!</p>
<p>Art Brut probably do, too. If they can't topple vague, pasty, barely breathing background rock from the charts, at least they can sing gloriously doomed songs about it. ""Cool your warm jets, Brian Eno,"" Argos jibes on ""Slap Dash for No Cash"", teasing shiny U2 clones the way he previously skewered vapid post-punk revivalists. Argos champions instead the records where you can hear not only the crack of the singer's voice, or the squeak of the guitarist's fingers, but also (as on a Gorky's Zygotic Mynci B-side, apparently) their parents complaining about the volume-- not because those records are more artistically valid, or more authentic or whatever, but for a more important reason: ""Those are the records I <i>like</i>.""</p>
<p>Black gets the Art Brut spirit down on record better than anyone has before, with the blazing pop-metal vainglory of Weezer, the scruffy cheekiness of early Rough Trade bands, and lots of enthusiastic backing vocals. Fun for them, fun for us. ""Demons Out!"" shifts the Smiths' ""Panic!"" from hanging DJs to denying record buyers suffrage, but don't mistake it for a Death Cab for Cutie-like manifesto against U.S. Auto-Tune pop; more accurately, it's an ideal rebuke against the endless Travis Kooks Kaiser Chiefs Razorlight blandness of UK ""science museum"" rock. So too ""The Replacements"", which melds the Mats' ""Alex Chilton"" and the Brut's ""My Little Brother"" into a clamorous endorsement of used CDs and deluxe reissues. Extending the prior album's trend toward sacrilegious song titles, ""Twist and Shout"" may not have you accidentally repeating its off-key la-la-las in public, like the song's narrator, but you'll probably know exactly how he feels. Not that Satan gives a damn about songs that communicate aspects of everyday life with clarity and human charm.</p>
<p><span>Art</span> <span>Brut</span> remain ever the underdog when they're singing about arrested development and girls, too. ""DC Comics and Chocolate Milkshake"" is a cereal-eaters' song as universal as Jerry Seinfeld, with a nicely echoing bridge, while perfectly sloppy public-transportation anthem ""The Passenger"" rewrites Iggy Pop from the perspective of a guy who can't drive. ""Summer Job"", with its Vampire Weekend-whooping intro vocal, is the album's only concession to conventional melody, and its summertime-blues-curing slackerdom could hardly be more enjoyably juvenile. Like a bizarro ""Rusted Guns of Milan"", ""What a Rush"" fumbles for morning-after Beatles vs. Stones meaning-- and socks. Add to vocab: ""Sober...<i>ish</i>?"". Slowing down but not going ballad, ""Am I Normal?"" is a preview of the kind of shy neurotic who might go on to write ""Emily Kane"".</p>
<p><i>Art Brut Vs. Satan</i> begins and ends with a hungover Argos trying to remember what he did the night before. Frantically buzzing opener ""Alcoholics Unanimous"" finds Argos sending apologetic mass texts; he's been concerned about what he's been up to, and with good reason. On epic finale ""Mysterious Bruises"", which I didn't even notice was seven minutes until I looked it up later, Argos proclaims: ""I fought the floor and the floor won."" Satan always wins. The beautiful people and their sycophants will always outnumber lovable losers. But this is a record I <i>like</i>.</p></div>"|12902.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12902-art-brut-vs-satan/|7.7|Marc Hogan

The best of the records Pollard helmed under the Guided by Voices name  in the mid-1990s were laid down wherever an outlet could be found by Pollard  and a fairly tight crew of four-tracking cronies. Although they'd  have plenty of successes after the post-<i>Under the Bushes</i> dissolution  of the band's ""classic"" lineup, that core of Pollard,  Tobin Sprout, Mitch Mitchell, and Kevin Fennell is still Bob's band to  beat. Sure, these days Pollard's got as many musical pseudonyms as he's  got auxiliary recycling bins-- the Circus Devils, the Takeovers, this  new Cosmos thing with Richard Davies, to name but a few-- and his frequent  collaborations with producer and multi-instrumentalist Todd Tobias is  as close to a working relationship as any Pollard's had over  the years. But fans knew something was up when Pollard took  the Spaceships out for their maiden voyage last fall, following the release  of their stellar debut, <i>Brown Submarine</i>, announcing all the while to  anyone sober enough to remember that its follow-up was already in the  can. It's clear the Boston Spaceships is Pollard's new band, not just another project. It's clearer  still, after a couple records in less than six months' time, that  the man's pretty okay with that.</p>
<p>As he should be. <i>Brown Submarine</i> was, until recently, the single finest LP Pollard's been associated  with since the dissolution of Guided by Voices in the middle of this  decade. Now-- but only by a nose-- <i>The Planets Are Blasted</i> has staked  its claim on that increasingly less dubious title. The breezy <i>Brown  Submarine</i> brimmed with hooks and neat little instrumental flourishes  and, most important, vitality. Picking up where that record let off, <i>The  Planets Are Blasted</i> most often than not just <i>rips</i>, opting for a slurry Zeppelin-y stomp even  at the expense of some of its predecessor's catchiness. To my ears,  Pollard hasn't put out a good ol' drinking record like this one in forever:  heady, quick to inspire the raising of glasses, with complexities that  linger far after the initial buzz wears off.</p>
<p>It certainly doesn't hurt that Pollard's  once again brought nothing but good stuff to the party. There was hardly a song worth saving on January's  miserable solo LP <i>The Crawling Distance</i>, but Pollard's just piling 'em on here,  matching bouncy verse with tension-building pre-chorus to fist-pumping  tagline in nearly every song. What could've been a trio of memorable  little one-minute ditties at the back end of <i>Alien Lanes</i> become knotty,  breathless three-minute barnstormers on <i>The Planets Are Blasted</i>; take,  for example, the fantastic ""Tattoo Mission"", which matches  a beery groove of a verse or two into a swirling Slusarenko-arranged  string hook that positively explodes into sweetly symphonic pop through  its last minute. Too often, Pollard's recent tunes are lucky to get  two out of the three right, but here, even the weak spots seem to carry  their weight, propelled by some of the most engaged-sounding Pollard  vocal performances in memory.</p>
<p>More credit must be given to drummer John Moen  and particularly guitarist/bassist Chris Slusarenko, who helped buoy <i>Brown Submarine</i> and keep <i> Planets Are Blasted </i>moving ever-skyward. Moen's just got more to play  with here than he did on the fairly straightforward <i>Submarine</i> songs,  and his burly tromping keep the big moments pumping  through your chest long after they're over. But it's Slusarenko who's  really got Pollard's number, filling in the blanks in the tunes with  punchy bass work and note-perfect guitar stabs. Instrumentally, Pollard's  solo work all too often zigs when it seems stupid not to zag. But Slursarenko  seems to have a clear sense of how best to serve the songs, and when to get the hell out of the way.  Even a relative lowlight like ""Catherine From Mid-October"",  which suffers from the same dowdy structural bloat as a lot of Pollard's  00s cuts, manages just finen thanks in no small part to Slusarenko's steady  hand.</p>
<p>There's a passage in ""Sight on  Sight"" where the slightly distended thump the song eases into after  minute one slides into a sprightly acoustic guitar line that eventually  settles into another, better tune. That moment right there is in many  ways the perfect distillation of what makes these Spaceships work; Pollard's  operating in the mode he's always been best in (<i>Bee Thousand</i> is made up of transitions, after all) and sounding better than he has in years,  with a couple of guys behind him who seem to understand what fits and what doesn't. In many  ways, Pollard's still Pollard-- lyrically inscrutable, as generous with  hooks as he is with bewildering sonic left-turns, and probably slightly mad--  but the Pollard who made the <i>Planets Are Blasted</i> sounds a lot more like  the guy still blowing Dayton School District paychecks on beer and Maxells  some 15 years back than whoever it was who laid <i>The Crawling Distance</i> on us. And, if the guys making the racket behind  him might not be Mitch and Kevin and Toby, they're doing a better job  of it than anybody who's come along since. Robert Pollard needs a band, and we oughta be awfully glad he's settled on this one.</p></div>"|12916.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12916-the-planets-are-blasted/|7.5|Paul Thompson

Where most EPs put their best foot forward, here Suckers close with their strongest song to date: ""It Gets Your Body Movin'"", which does  just as the song's title suggests and more-- it gets you singing as  well.</p>
<p>Call it a strong first impression <i> and</i> mixtape ammo. Built around a base of tribal drums and waterlogged guitars, ""It Gets Your Body Movin'"" lives and dies by  its titular refrain, five words that-- laced with a lazy bit of whistling-- crescendo and build and expand before bursting outright. By measure of sheer collective  sing-a-long voltage, one could tag the song an ""anthem"" and  call it a day. But on a short release stuffed with  and defined by oversized, campfire vocal confetti, I'm not sure how  well the descriptor really captures the psychotropic pop spaces and  grooves that Suckers and producer Anand Wilder (of fellow Brooklyn indie-rock  mystics Yeasayer) are gunning for. This feels much more communal or  even experiential than what that word connotes. This feels like a reason  to hold hands and beat your chest, not place the former over the latter.</p>
<p>Though the approach or rhythm differs,  that vibe pervades throughout. On ""Beach Queen"", lead vocalist Quinn Walker sounds every bit as Byrne-nian  on his own as Clap Your Hands Say Yeah's Alec Ounsworth did when he  arrived four years ago. The vocal hook isn't nearly as fetching as  the way the synths melt into one another, but that itch to join in remains. ""Easy Chairs"" opens with a bit of PCP barber-shop  harmonizing before skipping off at a pace befitting its ""Ring Around the Rosies"" melody. ""Afterthoughts &amp; TV"" boasts a galloping chorus that, while every bit as exuberant as ""Movin'"",  features a buffet of instrumentation (horn explosions, piano, twang)  that hints further at a band with an ear for more. Just four songs in  and we've got a very satisfying, very clear idea of what to expect.  To have more would be sweet, to continue to be plesantly surprised even better.</p></div>"|12947.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12947-suckers-ep/|7.9|David Bevan

<p>Pterodactyl play a familiar brand of exuberant, sunburned psychedelic-inspired indie-- not too far off from Oneida, the godfathers of the Brah label which is now releasing the band's second album. Their debut was contagiously manic while being simply, satisfyingly melodic; <i>Worldwild</i> sticks to the same basic sound, but offers grander gestures and a more layered listen. If the album has a loose theme, it hovers around the search for a spiritual bond with the planet, with lyrics about waterfalls and ambling journeys into the woods. A lot of <i>Worldwild</i> has the band honing its normally loud, boisterous elements into mimicking nature, like the tribal rhythm and singsong chant of ""February"" or the cascading melody and layers of ""Old Clouds"".</p>
<p>Despite the healthy amount of noise the band can work up, headphone listening reveals ambitious touches like the high-pitched harmonies hovering over lurching, stop-start rhythms in ""Rising &amp; Shining"" and ""First Daze"".The record's best tracks such as ""Share the Shade"" fold the mania of earlier Pterodactyl songs like ""Polio"" into something that barrels through a few hairpin turns instead of remaining straightforward, while the rhythm section keeps its tectonic rumble at top speed. Drummer Matt Marlin has always been the band's not-so-secret weapon, so it's a surprise that one of the album's most affecting songs begins without any percussion at all: The vocal in ""December"" offers breathless narration over a plaintive morse-code pulse of guitar, providing one of the record's most sparse and gorgeous moment</p>
<p><span>Much of <i>Worldwild</i> either drifts or holds back; even its more immediate songs seem wary of being too melodically obvious or offering too much catharsis at once. On their debut, Pterodactyl were figuring out who they were as a band, but the inertia of their songs ably distracted from the record's seams. Here, there's some familiar patterns, but between breaks for acoustic primitivism and sound-collage interludes, they still seem to be figuring things out-- all while trying to put together a more cohesive album. While the highlights like ""Share the Sound"" or ""No Sugar"" refine the band's sound into something more sophisticated yet brawny, their attempts to make all of it congeal into a whole is what feels forced. It's not that the band shouldn't be ambitious, or that putting together a more coherent end-to-end listening experience is a bad thing. But <i>Worldwild</i> is just their second album; did they have to grow up so fast?</span></p></div>"|12946.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12946-worldwild/|6.4|Jason Crock

Not that Super Furry Animals were the ones who needed to get theirs <i>back</i>, exactly. I mean, sure, 2007's <i>Hey Venus!</i> wasn't so much ""speaker blowing""-- lead singer Gruff Rhys' advertisement-- as ""hey, <span class=""il"">SFA</span> still don't suck yet."" But before that, 2005's <i>Love Kraft </i>was a multi-layered psych-funk-folk-samba epic about love, war, and ""no more romantic comedies."" Since then, the Welsh quintet's offbeat side projects-- such as Rhys's Delorean-themed Neon Neon partnership with Boom Bip, or keyboardist Cian Ciárán's electronic-leaning Acid Casuals-- have kept the Super Furry faithful well-supplied.</p>
<p>Dark days? Uhh, have you picked up a newspaper lately? Me neither, which I assume is part of the problem. ""People that go out and murder people don't read <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>,"" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg told CNN's Wolf Blitzer the other day, on whether the shitty economy added to gun violence. And yet all of a sudden a lot of liberal-arts-damaged hipsters seem to know a hell of a lot about the financial sector. Call it a capital infusion: <span class=""il"">SFA</span>'s ninth album in almost two decades as a band, <i>Dark Days/Light Years</i>, is also their most playful since 2001's <i>Rings Around the World</i>. Full of paradoxes and loving parodies, honeyed psych-pop harmonies and shaggy vamps, it's just the sci-fi groove-rock mindfuck to shake us out of our no-fun times.</p>
<p>First, the grooves: <span class=""il"">SFA</span> assembled <i>Dark Days/Light Years</i>-- nine years in the making, 40 days in the recording-- largely out of riffs and ideas that for one reason or another had gone unused. The results are as free-wheeling and inspired as the group has sounded in years-- Super-er and Furrier. Heavy blooz schoolgirl-ballers from Grand Funk Railroad to Eric Burdon can keep their puds and their guts squeezed tight into their bellbottoms after opener ""Crazy Naked Girls"", a three-part song that reclaims wah wah and a whole lotta lovin'. Groove turns to stomp on Ciárán-fronted ""Mt."", which places Donovan folk mysticism over glam-rock schaffel.</p>
<p>Then, when the machines groove, it's motorik. The Super Furries meet the ensuing depression with... more wryness. ""Let us make the best of a difficult situation,"" Rhys intones on first single ""Inaugural Trams"", the album's top stand-alone track. In a utopian universe where it would've been politically feasible for President Obama to announce, upon his inauguration, a plan to reduce emissions (""by 75!"") and restore the economy through a public-transportation moon race, ""Inaugural Trams""-- with Franz Ferdinand's Nick McCarthy rapping some of the only German words I know that aren't ""Kraftwerk"" or ""hefeweizen""-- would be the summer jam. If ""Inaugural Trams"" is ""the definitive krautrock song about railcars,"" as <i>New York</i> magazine's Vulture blog wondered recently, it's only in the way <i>Rings Around the World</i>'s ""Juxtaposed With U"" was the definitive Philly soul sexx jam. In other words, it's something else.</p>
<p>And it's not alone. Lester Bangs once recommended a young punk band call their album <i>The Monkees' Greatest Hits</i>; the biggest disappointment here is that the Super Furries didn't make ""The Very Best of Neil Diamond"" the title track. The song's ancient licks and sweaty percussion might suggest early 00s R&amp;B, or some kind of Eastern thing, but far from it: The chorus of ""trust but verify"" swipes a favorite Cold War catchphrase of Ronald Reagan. Somewhere before the guitar-gnashing bridge, I guess there's also this narrative about a Neil Diamond tape playing in the aftermath of an apocalypse. (And I'm told you can hear quotes from Vivaldi and Beethoven in <i>Metal Machine Music</i>, too...) Right after ""The Very Best of Neil Diamond"" takes us to ""Sweet Caroline"" and back, ""Helium Hearts"" drops us off in Eden. With perfect hippie-dippie non sequiturs about wedding rings, togetherness, and vegemite, it's probably the closest <span class=""il"">SFA</span>'s latest comes to the swooning, ELO-lite psych-pop of past highlights like 1996's ""Something 4 the Weekend"".</p>
<p>Just because a band sticks to the old-fashioned idea of an album as a cohesive piece of work doesn't mean it has to get all stuffy about it: <i>Dark Days/Light Years</i> begins with casual chatter and ends, after the ""Beat It"" meets ""Livin' on a Prayer"" bass lines and burbling vocal nonsense of Ciárán-penned quasi-instrumental ""Pric"", with three minutes of droning electronic tones. (<span class=""il"">SFA</span> have played this kind of prank before, burying career highlights on hidden tracks or non-album singles.) Guitarist Huw Bunford's ""White Socks/Flip Flops"" makes up in wet synths, blistering guitars, and taut rhythms what it lacks in fashion sense; fuzzed bass-guitar duel ""Inconvenience""-- not an Au Pairs cover-- goes from ""what the fuck?"" to jihad and pirate ships (timely!). Even the least exceptional tracks here, twinned songs ""Where Do You Wanna Go?"" and ""Lliwiau Llachar"", still offer raucous drumming and catchy Welsh-language vocals.</p>
<p>Remember when columnists predicted the death of irony after 9/11? Didn't happen, but between the whole everybody-losing-their-jobs thing and having an actual well-meaning grown-up in the White House, deadly seriousness is more of a threat now than ever. At least there's Glenn Beck. In the meantime, <i>Dark Days/Light Years</i> brings some good vibes for everyone ""from middle-aged sophisticates to stone-aged reprobates,"" to borrow a line from the rhythmically restrained, Spoon-like ""Moped Eyes"". It used to be called ""Hot Nuts"".</p></div>"|12935.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12935-dark-dayslight-years/|8.3|Marc Hogan

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>How much does a good mix need to do? If you stop and think about it, there doesn't seem to be a very complicated agenda behind the best ones: keep the rhythmic momentum consistent, shift the tone or mood at the right moment for emphasis, transition between tracks in a non-disruptive way, and cover enough stylistic ground to avoid tedium without going too far and coming across as a disjointed, genre-hopping traffic jam. It's music designed for moving, and if the people are moving, then technically it works. But there's a difference between going to hear someone DJ at a club and actually investing in a mix CD: in the latter case, there's that extra burden of permanence, of knowing that someone will pull this off their shelf or their hard drive years from now as a snapshot of a moment in sound.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span><i>Infinity +1 </i></span><span>says something in that respect: if you want an hour's worth of what constitutes the midpoint between popular and underground dance music at the end of this decade, call A-Trak. Between his Kanye West cred, his facility with a wide spectrum of club music subgenres, his recent history of quality releases like <i>Dirty South Dance, </i></span><span>and his just-out entry into the FabricLive series, he's established himself as a favorite among the shutter-shades generation, and for good reason. He's great at putting familiar styles into interesting contexts, blurring lines between eras, and just plain knowing what tracks sound good next to each other. <i>Infinity +1 </i></span><span>is an enjoyable exhibition of those skills, even if it's not particularly outlandish in its celebration of modern (and a little classic) electro and house.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>The mix isn't without its personality, of course: It opens with Shel Silverstein reading his poem ""Invitation"" (""If you are a dreamer, a wisher, a liar/ A hope-er, a pray-er, a magic bean buyer/ If you're a pretender, come sit by my fire""), then segues into John Dahlbäck's chirpy, upbeat ""Sidewalk"" with accompaniment by an astronomy-documentary voiceover relaying the life cycle of a maturing star. Not like this is A-Trak's big grown-up artistic statement, though, even if he does pay respect to his elders via Lifelike's electro-fied remix of Farley ""Jackmaster"" Funk's 1986 house classic ""Love Can't Turn Around"" and Alexander Robotnick's 83 Italo cult smash ""Problemes d'Amour"". For the most part, it's a succession of names you might've seen if you keep up with the right labels, or at least the MP3 blog discodust: Holy Ghost! (""Hold On""), DJ Mehdi (""Pocket Piano""), Little Boots (""Stuck on Repeat"", remixed by Fake Blood)-- and, a few times, A-Trak himself, both as remixer (Sébastien Tellier's ""Kilometer""; MSTRKRFT's N.O.R.E.-featuring ""Bounce"") and remixee (DJ Spinna reworking his deathless ""Say Whoa"").</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Yet as familiar as these tracks might be to scenesters, they're even more familiar to A-Trak-- he knows their ins and outs so deeply he has the exact knowledge of where they most effectively overlap. The beatmatching on <i>Infinity +1 </i></span><span>is immaculate, hiding the seams so well that he creates brief pockets of mash-up serendipity: The new-wave dance rock bassline of Midnight Juggernauts' ""Shadows"" dovetails neatly into the stuttering vocal intro to the Boys Noize remix of Gonzales' ""Working Together"", and K.I.M.'s burbling synthpop-meets-Detroit techno throwback ""Party Machini"" gets snuck up on by Laurent Wolf's ""The Crow"" to create a monster tandem bassline. And even though the overall tenor of the mix might be familiar, club-friendly electrohouse, A-Trak shows his range by flavoring it with modern hip-house crossover (""Bounce""; Donnis'B-more-meets-ATL ""Party Works""; new Kid Sister track ""Life on TV"") and concluding it with the pastoral, acoustic guitar-driven Prins Thomas remix of James Yuill's ""This Sweet Love"". There's been better mixes this year-- A-Trak's own <i>Fabriclive.45 </i></span><span>amongst them-- but if you want to stick evidence of life in early 2009 into a time capsule for exhuming a decade later, <i>Infinity +1 </i></span><span>will put this era in a positive light.</span></p>

<p>On paper, it's hard to imagine  a couplet that looks less like an opener for  one of the best albums of the 1960s. When you hear it barked out by Monks  lead vocalist Gary Burger over an otherworldly groove, though, it's  an unlikely call to arms, and an immediate auditory stamp for one of  the most strikingly original bands of the mid-60s. The band's sole studio album, released only in Germany in March 1966, has since  become something of a legend, hailed as a precursor to punk and krautrock,  and exerting influence far beyond its modest initial sales. Obscurities  that routinely bathe in glowing praise naturally engender skepticism  among people who haven't yet heard them, and often that skepticism is  healthy. In the case of the Monks, though, all the praise is true: in  1966, <i>Black Monk Time</i> was beyond the cutting edge, and today  it's easy to hear what made it so innovative and challenging.</p>
<p>The Monks were five Americans  living in West Germany. They came there as G.I.s, stationed near Heidelberg  in the southwestern Baden-Württemberg region, and the Monks began life  inauspiciously as the 5 Torquays, a run-of-the-mill beat group that  covered Chuck Berry and the latest English groups, drawing good local  crowds. When their time in the Army was up, they stayed, but beneath  the conventional exterior of the Torquays lay a group hungry to experiment  and break the mold of beat music. They accidentally discovered guitar  feedback during a rehearsal, and made it a part of their sound, to the  dismay of club owners and some patrons. Their apparent willingness to  experiment brought them to the attention of two German ad executives,  Walther Niemann and Karl Remy, who the band took on as managers, and  who would fundamentally reshape the band's image and sound.</p>
<p><i>You know we don't like the  Army</i><br/><i>What army?</i><br/><i>Who cares what army?</i><br/><i>Why do you kill all those  kids over there in Vietnam?</i><br/><i>Mad Viet Cong!</i><br/><i>My brother died in Vietnam</i><br/><i>James Bond, who was he?</i><br/><i>Stop it, stop it, I don't  like it!</i><br/><i>It's too loud for my ears!</i></p>
<p>It's this sequence of lines  from ""Monk Time"" that drives home just what a different game <i> Black Monk Time</i> is. After his call to arms, Burger's demented vocal  runs through a whithering critique of war, sealing it with a curt dismissal  of James Bond, who at the time was the biggest movie hero in the world.  It not only decries violence, but the glorification and fetishization  of violence, and Larry Clark's brutal organ interjection is waved off  with a couplet that swiftly co-opts critics of the band's new, chaotic  sound. One of the things that makes ""Monk Time"" one of the all-time  great album openers is how completely it distills the band and its music.  The stomping, repetitive bass and drum groove, the splatter of fuzz  guitar, the six-string electric banjo hammering out percussive chords,  the flailing vocals and loud organ outbursts exemplify the band's confrontational,  rhythm-based sound. This is not flower power-- it's rage inspired by  senselessness and tempered with humor.</p>
<p>Perhaps paradoxically, what  makes the Monks' attack on war and the military so effective is the  military discipline they applied to the band. On stage and off, they  wore monks' robes with noose neck ties and cut their hair in the traditional  monks' tonsure, and their music has a rare precision for something so  wild. The group shouts of ""Shut up! Don't cry!"" on ""Shut Up""  are in lock-step, and they nail the complex, interlocking rhythm of  ""Complication."" All the members sang, and the backing vocals alternately  back Burger with drawn-out chants and sudden, shouted responses. ""Higgle-Dy  Piggle-Dy"" combines a children's rhyme with a savage rhythmic attack.</p>
<p>As doggedly out-there as they  could be, the Monks did possess some pop sense-- this music, unique  and strange as it is, is entirely approachable, and the band's final  recordings, made after Polygram panicked and told them to produce more  commercial material, are deranged pop songs that the band genuinely  seems to have fun with. ""I Can't Get Over You"" is like a cartoon  version of pop music, with weird falsetto harmonies and a big, rubbery  bassline, while ""He Went Down to the Sea"" has a tribal Beach Boys  quality, with its hard drumming, harmonies and glockenspiel. These and  a few others are added to Light in the Attic's reissue of the album,  as they were to Infinite Zero's long out-of-print 1994 reissue.</p>
<p>On the other side of the band's  brief career, <i>The Early Years</i> is a collection of the band's early  demos, made as they felt their way toward the sound of <i>Black Monk  Time</i>, along with a 45 made in 1964 when they were still the Torquays.  It has a different running order, but contains the same tracks as Omplatten's  out-of-print <i>Five Upstart Americans</i> compilation from 1999. LiTA's  two reissues are meant to function as a combined package, and Kevin  ""Sipreano"" Howes' detailed liner notes are written as one piece,  split across both discs. The material heard here is good, though anyone  new to the Monks should probably make sure they love <i>Black Monk Time</i> before picking it up, the same way you would with any band's demos.  One of the interesting things about the demos is how clearly the band's  vision had already crystalized-- the recording is structured something  like a musical mass, with little churchy organ interludes from Larry  Clark and a bit of banter from Burger. For a fan, to hear them honing  their rhythmic attack is gratifying-- their sound was no accident.</p>
<p>The Monks' music sounds so  inevitable on <i>Black Monk Time</i> that it's easy to forget how unlikely  the band's story is. For these five guys to find each other in the Army  and subsequently devote themselves so fully to such a unique sound,  and for two advertising executives to find them and push them to get  weirder-- well, there's a reason that even with every incredible change  in popular music during the 60s, there's only one Monks. Their one album  was revolutionary, but sparked no revolution, due to circumstances beyond  the band's control. They wandered back home and got real jobs, played  in other bands, and Burger even became mayor of Turtle River, Minnesota.  All these years later, you have a chance to hear what they did together  again. Don't miss out.</p></div>"|12905.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12905-black-monk-time-the-early-years-1964-1965/|9.2|Joe Tangari

It's like the guy's singing through the wall."" On one level, my friend's right. Jason Quever's one-man (plus guests) band makes blurred-edge music with damp organs, milky guitars, reverbed vocals, and sticky, half-familiar melodies seemingly snatched from some collective unconscious. And the album's opening couplet, ""Once we walked in the sunlight/ Three years ago this July 4th"", sums up Papercuts' temperamental pitch with tweet-like brevity. Their 2007 LP was titled <i>Can</i>'<i>t Go Back</i>, but as a songwriter Quever can't help but indulge nostalgia, including its bitter constituents, regret and remorse.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Papercuts, however, aren't agoraphobic shut-ins exorcising romantic demons and venting life's inequities. A backward-- and inward—looking predilection actually serves the band artistically. Quever crafts his aesthetic from the raw materials of Zombies, Velvet Underground, and Galaxie 500 appreciation, Phil Spector worship, and an indie rock gospel that equates modest ambitions with really, really meaning it. And the Bay Area singer-songwriter has buffed this sound to a rose-colored finish playing in and touring with 60s-rock fetishists Vetiver and pop deconstructionists Beach House and Grizzly Bear-- folks who consider musicological context. So a shivering dirge like ""Jet Plane"" or the spacey ether-float of ""A Peculiar Hallelujah"" don't seem <i>unduly</i> muted. They're simply well-crafted examples of a certain introspective, highly melodic pop tradition.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>Although <i>YCHWYW</i></span><span> doesn't offer a song as memorable as <i>Can</i>'<i>t Go Back</i>'s superb ""John Brown"", the tracklist's reasonably solid. First single ""Future Primitive"" is cool and minimal, pitting pulsed bass, throbbing toms, and biscuit-crisp snare hits and tambourines against Quaver's high, hazy croon. In the few moments before his voice enters the analog mix, you could almost imagine a smart-suited Smokey Robinson stepping up to the mic. Hypotensive organ droning opener ""Once We Walked in the Sunlight"" and a few other stretches drag, but punchier tracks like ""A Dictator's Lament"", with its infectious Paisley Underground chorus, and ""The Void"", which flips its slow-creeping intro for a psychedelic, honey-harmonied outro, redeem the record's narcoleptic drifts.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span>But then, warm bath and afternoon nap pop (or, as the ""Future Primitive"" video intimates, tunes for lone, swaddled journeys across post-apocalyptic landscapes), is what fans have come to expect from-- and love about-- Papercuts. If these songs are low-voltage wires that hum, buzz, whir, purr but rarely jolt, they yield just enough electricity to light the way forward. <span> </span><span> </span><span> </span> </span></p></div>"|12906.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12906-you-can-have-what-you-want/|7.4|Amy Granzin

At its best, the group worked like AC/DC remixed by Pablo Picasso, thrillingly off-kilter cubist-rock that rearranged itself in real time. At its worst, well, at least the band never stopped trying to keep people on their toes.</p>
<p>Regardless, the past is the past, and U.S. Maple guitarist Todd Rittman has moved on, and on again, first with Singer, a sort-of supergroup (for those with low supergroup standards) featuring members of 90 Day Men and Town and Country, and now with D. Rider, a no less (but no more) supergroup teaming Rittman with Cheer-Accident's keyboardist/cornet player Andrea Faught and Mucca Pazza reedist Noah Tabakin.</p>
<p>""Make no mistake,"" warns the press notes. ""This is not art-house studio meanderings. This is a rock record."" Actually, it's a little of both. Any disc that enlists scribbling magic marker as an instrument definitely passes the ""art-house studio meanderings"" test, but at the same time, that track, ""Arranged Marriage to No Toms"", does indeed rock, sort of. It's the best of both worlds for eggheads and bobbing heads alike. The dirgy ""Dew Claw Don't Claw"" rocks, too (sort of), its weird menace leading up to a guitar anti-solo that sounds a little like a modem locked in mortal battle with a dentist's drill (we'll call it a draw).</p>
<p>""Body to Body (to Body)"" is no less abrasive in its deconstructionist instincts, constantly turning in on itself while stuttered along a fitfully funky groove. While ""Welcome Out"" at first seems to be offering an acoustic guitar respite, finding some shared vision between jazz and folk. But then the deceptively stirring song leads to what could be its electric companion piece ""Dear Blocks"", this one introduced by the sound of a spray paint can being shaken and discharged before sinewy guitars and oddly-accented drums lock in with one another, synths begin to squelch, horns bleat, and the track peters out anti-climatically.</p>
<p>The same thing happens with ""Misery Whip"", which does a disservice to its awesome title and primordial riff, and really that's the problem with a lot of <i>Mother of Curses</i>. Too often, D. Rider sound (sometimes literally) like a scratch pad, like they're still working out where they wants to go even as the tape rolls. The music here is intriguing, sometimes mysterious, and does often rock. Or, at least, <i>sort of</i> rock, a little like U.S. Maple did, by trying to redefine what rocking even means. Yet even the most promising grooves, like ""Touchy"" or the jarring ""Marksman"", go nowhere in the end. Crafting art-house meanderings that rock turns out to be the easy part.  It's sticking the landing that's hard, and no matter how much D. Rider twists, turns and tumbles in midair, they're just not there yet.</p></div>"|12920.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12920-mother-of-curses/|5.2|Joshua Klein

For those of you keeping score at home, ""darker"" seems to refer to most of his output as Smog, when his songwriting often succumbed to the weary dread his dead-planet of a voice exudes like gravity. The lightening occurred over the course of <i>A River Ain't Too Much to Love</i>, his final record as Smog, and <i>Woke on a Whaleheart</i>, his first post-Smog effort. On these records, romantic gratitude gradually replaced romantic pessimism. Bill Callahan was <i>happy</i>; at peace. But it wasn't to last. The slumbering beast of love, ""the lion walking down city streets,"" awoke, and it was pissed. He got dark again.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">""I started telling the story/ Without knowing the end."" And he's still doing so. <span>Over the past two decades, Callahan's music has chronicled his unique, troubling insights about responsibility, faith, and love. </span>The darkness that falls over <i>Sometimes I Wish We Were an Eagle </i>does not make it a Smog record-- it is an uncommonly gentle darkness that sounds light at first blush. Smog's malevolence seemed like a sweeping indictment of human nature, but here, Callahan's lyrics feel intensely personal. The record, an evident break-up affair, has such a strong air of private conversation that listening to it feels like eavesdropping; the second-person pronouns sail right past us to strike the target of the absent beloved. The reverent intimacy can become almost uncomfortable, as Callahan proffers up his words in the same way the devout handle rosaries.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Like <i>Whaleheart</i>, <i>Eagle</i> is kitted out with the instrumentation-- cellos and violins, French horns, pump organs, electric pianos-- that he embraced post-Smog. On <i>Whaleheart</i>, such embellishments were rangy and shambling; here they're loosely clenched, as if Callahan built the music to hold him together. <i>Eagle </i>addresses a specific-sounding lost love, but more broadly, it does what every Callahan record does: It takes a long hard look at who he is and what he believes at this moment. As a result, it finds him questioning the truths he discovered on <i>Whaleheart</i>, as when, on ""Eid Ma Clack Shaw"", he dreams the perfect song and scribbles it down in the middle of the night, discovering in his notebook the next morning the nonsense words of the song's title.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This self-portrait is so complex and subtle that it's tempting to skip discussing the actual music, which speaks so eloquently for itself. Some of the finest, most varied arrangements of Callahan's career are here. Wafting strings and contrapuntal soprano vocals render ""Rococo Zephyr"" as buoyant and lilting as its namesake. On ""Eid Ma Clack Shaw"", silvery electric guitar moves up and down staccato piano. ""My Friend"" and ""All Thoughts are Prey to Some Beast"" are almost like folk-Krautrock, with interlocked motifs billowing out over rigid pulses. Best of all is how the clenched arrangements open out into flowing, tender catharsis, and these are the moments you'll come to anticipate-- wait for the beatific chorus that bears Callahan's dense voice improbably high above the sinuous strains of ""The Wind and the Dove"", or the effervescent strings casting periodic surges of light through ""Jim Cain"".</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Like the birds he loves so well, Callahan's albums find him alighting momentarily on precarious perches and naming what he sees. By the time we hear the music, he seems to have flown on again. His vantage from <i>Eagle</i> is one of textured ambivalence; his images split and shimmer like double-exposures, immediately releasing an obvious meaning quickly followed by a subtler one that equivocates the first. He's ""still as a river could be,"" and a ""child of linger on."" He used to be ""sort of blind,"" but now he can ""sort of see."" On ""Faith/Void"", he decides that it's time to ""put God away,"" to no longer strive for his ""peace in the light."" Twenty years in, and Bill Callahan appears to be tearing up everything he's believed and starting from scratch, armed with the terrifying wisdom of knowing that one knows nothing, and searching for meaning regardless.

<p>Other soul singers may have had more raw power or a wider stylistic range (although not many of them), but nobody else had Green's virtuosity or interpretive gifts.

And, while virtually every other soul marquee name of the era was recording with session dudes, he had a real band worthy of his gifts: guitarist Teenie Hodges, organist Charles Hodges, bassist Leroy Hodges, drummers Howard Grimes and Al Jackson, backup singers Rhodes, Chalmers and Rhodes, and producer Willie Mitchell, who'd had a string of instrumental hits of his own in the 60s and knew how to shape Green's expansive gifts into compact 210-second packages.

<p>The title track of <i>Let's Stay Together</i> is a karaoke standard and an ""American Idol"" joke. Surprise: it got there by being one of the best-sung hits of the 70s.

Green wasn't yet firing on all cylinders as a songwriter, but even the album's lesser songs get spectacular performances. (As with his entire pre-gospel career, Jesus turns up unexpectedly-- this time in the middle of the otherwise secular groove ""So You're Leaving"".) The album's centerpiece is a six-minute-plus cover of the Bee Gees' ballad ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart"", on which his vocal is so light and flexible it seems to be fluttering in the breeze coming off the drums.</p>
<p><i>I'm Still In Love With You</i> recapitulates the successful <i>Let's Stay Together</i> formula, right down to the unlikely six-and-a-half-minute cover-- this time it's Kris Kristofferson's ""For the Good Times"". But that album had mostly been ""I don't want to break up"" songs; this one is solidly ""I love you, sweetie"" material, and it's even better. In part, that's because Green had learned to write to his voice's strengths, especially his superhuman falsetto. (""Simply Beautiful"", close-miked and nearly whispered, is a shudder of ecstasy at the mere image of a lover's body.) The band's arrangements are a master class in getting out of the way of the groove-- ""Love and Happiness"" is all headroom and negative space, and the drum break at the top of ""I'm Glad You're Mine"" is as understated as funk gets.</p>
<p>The present incarnation of the double-platinum <i>Greatest Hits</i> is not <i>quite </i>the original version-- the track listing shifted a little in '77-- but it's the 10-song sequence a lot of babies got made to: three songs from <i>Still In Love</i>, the title track from <i>Let's Stay Together</i>, and six more impeccable classics from the 1970-73 period. The smartly sequenced track listing proceeds from ""Tired of Being Alone"" to ""Let's Get Married"", and the lyrical range encompasses I-want-you, I-want-you-back, and I've-got-you-and-I'm-happy-about-it songs. If there's such a thing as an underplayed song from it, it's probably ""I Can't Get Next to You"", the 1970 single that saved him from one-hit-wonder-dom. The Temptations had had a #1 hit with it the year before, and Green swoops in and steals the song anyway. He transforms the arrangement to a slow, fretful Southern 6/8 bump-and-grind, and sings every line as a message of total sexual desperation, fading out on a perfect high note at precisely the pitch that disintegrates panty elastic.</p>
<p>As with the other reissues, the new <i>Greatest Hits</i> trims off the additional material that's turned up on the last few editions: no bonus tracks, no liner notes or historical context, just the album.

Maybe it's that Saddle Creek devotees expect a band called Ladyfinger (ne)-- the (ne) not (thank god) a coy reference to Barthes but to Nebraska-- to have more in common with their navelgazing labelmates. That's not to say that Ladyfinger (ne)-- comprised of singer/guitarist Chris Machmuller (formerly of Bleeders for Treats), ex-Faint bassist Ethan Jones, guitarist Jamie Massey, and drummer Pat Oakes -- aren't searching deep within their hearts and souls for inspiration, but all that rock'n'roll bluster obscures much of the whining. But it is this place, where the power chords meet the emotions bubbling up within, that the marriage of lust and anger starts to break down. It may've worked a charm for Rites of Spring, but in 2009, an over-therapized, coddled youth have a myriad other outlets (hellooooo, internets!) to channel their emotions.<br/><br/><i>Dusk</i>, the quartet's sophomore release, was produced by Minus the Bear's Matt Bayles, the force behind Mastodon's bruising, excellent 2006 album, <i>Blood Mountain</i>. It's a stronger, take-chancier album than <i>Heavy Hands</i>, Ladyfinger (ne)'s somewhat muddy and monotonous debut. Bayles' influence is striking, especially as <i>Dusk</i> kicks off with the promising ""Over &amp; Over"", which shuffles crisp rhythm guitars and a subtle, melodic bassline, before shifting to a somewhat more metal-typical jagged three-chord riff structure and Machmuller's prepossessing howl. Machmuller's got pipes like Cursive's Tim Kasher, and there are enough musical similarities between the two bands to make a tour-pairing work (Ladyfinger (ne) have opened for Cursive on multiple dates), though Ladyfinger's dogged four-square beat structures are snoozy compared with Cursive's elegant math-y parabolas. Now if only Ladyfinger (ne) would take some chances (add some strings! Or a flute! Write a concept album!). As it is, you can easily trace their antecedents: a healthy dose of Fugazi, a dollop of Foo Fighters, stubbly dischordance swiped from early 1990s Chicago bands like Wreck and the Jesus Lizard -- but without their snarl or wackadoodle fury. (Or, we can only imagine, glimpses of forbidden fruit, AKA Lizard frontman David Yow's legendary performance-art set piece, ""The Hairy Tangerine"".) Ladyfinger (ne) really want to rock with their balls out, but sentiment keeps blocking their baser instincts.<br/><br/>""Little Things"" is the standout track here, precisely because it stands out. Move over Motörhead, hello...Hawkwind? Replete with falsetto call-and-response woo-woos, ""Little Things"" is all power and momentum and baldface 70s classic-rock glory, and when the chorus breaks -- ""If you don't intend to really let me go, honey, then pull the trigger baby free my soul..."" you really want ""honey"" to get a grip. As opposed to ""Plums"", where some other Jane has taken her hopes and dreams and ""...cooked them up with the cocaine, and put them into [her] veins there, and now they lie with [her] remains. And that's where they'll stay..."" Which might be a lot more riveting if it didn't clash with an annoying, jangle-y backbeat. Ladyfinger (ne) are obviously a talented bunch, but they're trying to crack open the rock'n'roll firmament with ball-peen hammers, chiseling grooves without making any real breakthroughs. Which is fine in therapy, but not if you're rocking with your cock out. So to speak.</p></div>"|12790.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12790-dusk/|6.2|Adrienne Day

Their 1998 debut, <i>Honky Reduction</i>, helped inspire the ""drum machine grind"" subgenre. With minute-long bouts of smashing everything into nothing, grindcore was already absurd. Replacing human drummers with machines added an extra layer of absurdity. Now bands could crank speeds up to inhuman levels. As plastic percussion flailed away below thrash and death metal riffs, the various vocalists of Agoraphobic Nosebleed extolled drugs, guns, and fucking. It was the sound of civilization's decline, sold at Toys ""R"" Us with hazardous metal parts.</p>
<p>This aesthetic culminated in 2003's <i>Altered States of America</i>, which crammed 100 songs into 20 minutes. It was not an album so much as a temper tantrum. Songs ended just as they started. Drum machines came to life, administered brutal tattooings, and went to sleep, all in the space of seconds. The multiplicity of tracks challenged notions of what constituted a song. In its own cheap way, Agoraphobic Nosebleed shredded time into shards. Artists as diverse as Merzbow, Justin Broadrick, and Delta 9 picked up these pieces and reconfigured them on two remix efforts, <i>ANbRX</i> and <i>ANbRX II</i>. Agoraphobic Nosebleed the idea had become as important as Agoraphobic Nosebleed the band.</p>
<p><i>Agorapocalypse</i> is disappointingly listenable. Song lengths are up, exceeding two and three minutes, and the songwriting has diversified. Instead of simply beating listeners into a pulp, songs now speed up, slow down, and breathe. Katherine Katz, of doom metallers Salome, adds refreshingly aggressive female vocals. Male yellers Jay Randall and Richard Johnson still laud the usual taboos, with lurid artwork to match, but the setting feels much more mature. Scott Hull's drum programming now resembles human playing. The album opens with a faux live show lead-in; digital wooden drumsticks count in passages; ""Question of Integrity"" features an impressively realistic drum solo. Hull's guitar playing has also become more conventional, with extended (for grindcore, anyway) leads that don't get much airtime in his other gig, Pig Destroyer.</p>
<p>Maturity and humanity don't befit grindcore. The genre is about pushing limits and pursuing the perverse. Now, instead of an overheated drum machine, the beats could be played by a human (albeit an insanely athletic one). Even with fairly developed songwriting, as is the case here, one truth remains immutable: grindcore drags after about a minute. This record should be a jackhammer beatdown, but it merely feels like a very competent metal demo. Ten years ago, this record might have blown minds. But Agoraphobic Nosebleed has become a victim of its own innovation. Having pushed the envelope so far, it now sounds normal. In grindcore, that's a failure.</p></div>"|12933.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12933-agorapocalypse/|5.0|Cosmo Lee

Her debut album,  <i> Old Stories</i>, follows 2005's  <i> Young Hearts </i> EP, which featured elegantly pastoral covers of disco anthems by the likes of Candi Staton, Elton John, and Barry White, and indicated a promising beginning for Wallace's simple acoustic compositions.</p>
<p>Combining something borrowed with something new,  <i> Old Stories </i> features a handful of traditional songs tucked in between Wallace's original arrangements. Her interpretation of ""The True Lovers Farewell"", a Southern Appalachian folk ballad detailing the distress of a lover separated from the object of her devotion, is sung with a heart-wrenching sorrow that is eventually swept away by a cascade of accordions and the mournful sighs of a Busilacchio chord organ. The Celtic love song ""I Live Not Where I Love"" extends Wallace's reflections on distance and broken dreams over the clear pluck of strings, telling the story with her honeyed yet restrained vocal melodies, which naturally lilt with a slight Cockney warble. It's not all trouble and strife for Wallace, however. ""Many Years"" sparkles with the adventurous glow of a new beginning when she sings, ""I'm going where the wind won't find me, I'm going where the seas lie calm."" And ""The Way You Lie"" is an affectionate ode to a sweetheart that blossoms with the integral modesty that lies at the heart of the whole recording-- from the careful arrangements to her contemplative lyrical content.</p>
<p>This deft mesh of old and new songs flows together so that  <i> Old Stories </i> manages the impressive feat of sounding simultaneously timeless and modern. Wallace's skilful compositions flourish under her spare treatment, so that when she does choose to embellish particular patches, such as the addition of a violin solo in the middle of the traditional English folk song ""The Drowned Lover"" or the chromatic meandering of a concertina on ""Sleeping Sickness"", the result is suitably effective. It's proof that subtlety can be more dramatic than bravado, and testament to Wallace's knack for applying just the right amount of instrumentation to accompany her vivid tales of lovers walking to work through snowy woods or kicking stones around on a beach.</p>
<p>That said, the songs on  <i> Old Stories </i> have a tendency to sound a bit repetitive, despite being undeniably charming when listened to individually. Wallace's voice never really veers from the path she has set for it, her lyrics are unfailingly grounded in the theme of love and loss, and although instruments fashioned from bellows and buttons match her music well, on a nine-track album with few other dominant sounds, it can get a little irksome at times. However, these are minor issues compared to Wallace's substantial songwriting talent, which takes British folk traditions and reworks them into something just as authentic and beautiful.</p></div>"|12757.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12757-old-stories/|6.8|Mia Clarke

Most fervent Radiohead fans would have wasted their money buying these packages, and most people interested in the band would be best served by their actual albums. Well, Capitol has now begun to roll out those parent albums-- starting with the group's three 1990s releases (<i>Pablo Honey</i>, <i>The Bends</i>, <i>OK Computer</i>)-- again, without the band's participation. This time, however, the label is doing it right, dressing the releases up with the right accoutrements: B-sides from the era (and since the era overlapped with two-part CD singles, there are plenty), radio sessions, and music videos.</p>
<p>For an epochal, era-defining band, Radiohead had an unusual beginning, looking like they'd wind up one-hit wonders, chancers callously attaching themselves to a sound and moment yet with few ideas of their own. That first hit, ""Creep"", with its loud/soft dynamic and self-loathing lyric, fit snugly into the post-Nirvana alt-rock landscape-- no surprise: Radiohead copped as much from 80s indie rock as their Pac NW brethren did. Yet instead of being hamstrung by platinum success, Radiohead abandoned careerist moves for artistic ambitions, moving quickly to incorporate the record-collector's music of post-rock and Mo Wax, the post-dance, spiritually nurturing end of UK rock, and the pre-millennial tension of IDM and trip-hop.</p>
<p>By the end of the 90s, Radiohead hadn't supplanted U2, R.E.M., Oasis, and Metallica as the world's biggest rock band. But it was largely agreed upon that they were the world's best-- and with hindsight, arguably, along with the White Stripes, the last indie-friendly group to conquer the world and punch in the same weight class as early 90s alt-rock giants like Nine Inch Nails, Pearl Jam, Green Day, or Red Hot Chili Peppers. That they used this critical and commercial currency to such dazzling effect on <i>Kid A</i> and <i>Amnesiac</i> is still one of the highlights of this decade; that the press, especially in the UK, chose the more familiar and necrophiliac ""new rock revolution"" over the relatively pioneering Radiohead is one of the decade's lows.</p>
<p>UK rock, for all its heady artistry and visionaries throughout the 60s, 70s, and 80s, had been slumming it a bit when Radiohead first emerged. Size and grandeur, which would become the goals for too many UK guitar bands by the end of the Britpop era, were largely missing from that country's indie scene when Radiohead started recording in 1992. Sure, the Stone Roses had trumpeted their own greatness a few years earlier, but most of the era's indie music was introspective, bands content to gaze at their shoes rather than aim for the back of the venue.</p>
<p>Radiohead's early, full-bodied music was, in most circles then, dismissed as empty Americanisms-- and not without reason. The expansive <i>Pablo Honey</i> set-- the 12-song album accompanied by 22 extras-- mostly highlights a group in hock to U.S. indie heroes Pixes and Dinosaur Jr. (with the occasional R.E.M. homage tossed in-- see: ""Lurgee""). The loose ""Anyone Can Play Guitar"" and delicate ""Thinking About You"" thankfully break up the 120-minute mood, but most of the rest of the album is squarely in the post-grunge wheelhouse. That's not always a bad thing: ""Stop Whispering"", opener ""You"", and a re-recorded version of early single ""Prove Yourself"" hold up well-- and ""Creep"" has oddly gotten better with age. Elsewhere, the dreadful ""Pop Is Dead"", and songs like ""How Do You?"", ""I Can't"", ""Ripcord"", and ""Vegetable"" are run of the mill at best.</p>
<p>If <i>Pablo Honey</i> didn't betray hints of the band Radiohead would become, neither did its B-sides. Unlike contemporaries such as Blur, who used their non-album material to explore new ideas or moods, Radiohead's <i>Pablo Honey</i>-era work is primarily lesser versions of the album. The extra material kicks off with their debut release, the <i>Drill</i> EP, which features three rudimentary versions of LP tracks, plus ""Stupid Car"", the first of Thom Yorke's odd automobile-themed fixations (still to come: ""Killer Cars"", ""Airbag"", the ""Karma Police"" video...) From there, it's a mishmash of alternate takes and also-rans (highlight: the U.S. single version of ""Stop Whispering""), with only the shoegazey ""Coke Babies"" and an acoustic version of early political commentary ""Banana Co."" (released in much better form on <i>The Bends</i> package) worth exploring more than a few times.</p>
<p>I distinctly remember then the first time someone suggested <i>The Bends</i> was a great record. Not being one of the million-plus <i>Pablo Honey</i> owners at the time, I was content to hear ""Creep"" on the radio over and over and expected I'd soon spend about as much about time with Radiohead's catalog as one would with, say, Hum or Ned's Atomic Dustbin or School of Fish. The <i>My Iron Lung</i> EP had beaten <i>The Bends</i> to U.S. record shelves by a few months, and the ""High and Dry"" / ""Planet Telex"" single was out a few weeks prior as well, but few noticed. Anyone who had explored those two earlier singles, however, would have been excited for the LP.</p>
<p>A reaction to the success of ""Creep"", ""My Iron Lung"" found Radiohead still exploring the loud/soft dynamic, but guitarist Jonny Greenwood was also locating his own identity and Yorke, inspired by Jeff Buckley, was using a wider vocal range, including some falsetto. Balancing a slightly artier sense of musical self-destruction with a sinewy guitar line, on ""Lung"" Radiohead found new ways to pick apart and re-construct the typical alt-rock template. Elsewhere on the EP, the five B-sides demonstrated a band whose collective heads seemed to crack open and spill out new ideas, moving the group away from the dour dead-end of grunge signifiers: With more loose-limbed and nimble guitar work (""The Trickster""), hints of art-rock (""Punchdrunk Lovesick Singalong""), the valuing of texture over riffs (""Permanent Daygliht""), offers of emotional nourishment (""Lozenge of Love"" and ""You Never Wash Up After Yourself"") and tension and apprehension about workaday life (""Lewis [Mistreated]""), and themes of misanthropy (um, most of the five songs), these tracks pointed the way toward what was to come.</p>
<p>The band's next release, the ""High and Dry"" / ""Planet Telex"" single, announced that they'd arrived. ""Planet Telex"", an early exploration with loops and studio enhancements for the group, is their first song that could have fit on any of their albums, regardless of how experimental they grew; ""High and Dry"", meanwhile, is the blueprint for the big-hearted balladry that spawned the careers of imitators Travis, Starsailor, Elbow, and Coldplay (who, let's face it, wound up perfecting this sort of huggable, swelling arena rock).</p>
<p><i>The Bends</i> was essentially split between these poles: warmth and tension; riffs and texture; rock and post-rock. The tricks employed by ""Planet Telex"" were rarely bested on it-- only arguably by ""Just""-- while the ""High &amp; Dry"" version of the band was topped at every turn here, especially on ""Street Spirit (Fade Out"") and ""Fake Plastic Trees"". Even B-sides such ""Bishop's Robes"" and ""Talk Show Host"" come close to matching ""High"".</p>
<p>To many fans, this more approachable and loveable version of the band is its peak. I can't agree, but the record is still a marvel. It feels, with hindsight, like a welcome retreat from the incessant back-patting and 60s worship of prime-period Britpop and a blueprint for the more feminine, emotionally engaging music that would emerge in the UK a few years later-- led by <i>OK Computer</i>. Alongside late 1996 or 1997 releases by Verve, Spiritualized, Belle and Sebastian, Cornershop, Mogwai, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, Primal Scream, Super Furry Animals, the Beta Band, Mansun, and even Britpop stars Blur, Radiohead's <i>OK Computer</i> led the push back against knuckle-dragging Oasis clones who segregated their Boomer rock leanings from the fertile explorations of dance, classic indie, hip-hop, and art-school sensibilities going on throughout the rest of the UK. But once again, the press chose what they knew over the new, and despite the plaudits for 2000's <i>Kid A</i>, by the time of 2001's <i>Amnesiac</i>, people wanted another <i>The Bends</i>.</p>
<p><i>OK Computer</i> was the balance everyone agreed upon though-- real songs and tunes, but ones that didn't shrink from the increasingly unlimited possibilities of modern music-making. In that sense, Radiohead were not only record-collectors but futurists, approaching the 21st century from the perspective of their day rather than from the generation prior, as Stereolab, Broadcast, Tortoise, and others were doing (to wonderful effect, granted). Discounting the breather ""Fitter Happier"", only ""Electrioneering"" seems like a misstep on the album today, with the white-knuckle ""Climbing Up the Walls"" and pre-album teaser ""Lucky"" now standing firmly alongside more entrenched highlights ""Paranoid Android"", ""No Surprises"", ""Karma Police"", and ""Let Down"".</p>
<p>The record's B-sides are no less rewarding, especially ""Polyethylene (Parts 1 &amp; 2)"" and ""Melatonin"", which would have fit fine on LP itself. ""Palo Alto"" proves they could do light and tongue-in-cheek, while ""Meeting in the Aisle"" makes you wonder why they don't record more instrumentals. The group's eventual fascination with, for a successful 90s guitar band, relatively foreign sounds like IDM and 20th century classical music found root around this time and it's on these extras where they first explored these notions.</p>
<p>Maybe you don't need to buy these again, maybe you own the material already. If you do, sure-- pass. If you have the LPs but stopped there, both <i>The Bends</i> and <i>OK Computer</i> are worth getting in these versions. If you're curious or a completist, <i>Pablo Honey</i> is out there, too. That the band had nothing to do with these is beside the point: This is the final word on these records, if for no other reason that the Beatles' September 9 remaster campaign is, arguably, the end of the CD era. That all of those discs are coming out at the same time, rather than being slowly and ceremoniously rolled out as they were 20-odd years ago, is a tacit acknowledgment by the music industry that they best sell non-vinyl physical products now, immediately, before the prospect of doing so is gone. With that in mind, I find it wise that many bands are wisely re-organizing their pasts, or having it done for them by their label. So long as it's done like this, I'm happy to re-purchase the stuff.</p></div>"|12938.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12938-pablo-honey-collectors-edition-the-bends-collectors-edition-ok-computer-collectors-edition/|5.4|Scott Plagenhoef

Most fervent Radiohead fans would have wasted their money buying these packages, and most people interested in the band would be best served by their actual albums. Well, Capitol has now begun to roll out those parent albums-- starting with the group's three 1990s releases (<i>Pablo Honey</i>, <i>The Bends</i>, <i>OK Computer</i>)-- again, without the band's participation. This time, however, the label is doing it right, dressing the releases up with the right accoutrements: B-sides from the era (and since the era overlapped with two-part CD singles, there are plenty), radio sessions, and music videos.</p>
<p>For an epochal, era-defining band, Radiohead had an unusual beginning, looking like they'd wind up one-hit wonders, chancers callously attaching themselves to a sound and moment yet with few ideas of their own. That first hit, ""Creep"", with its loud/soft dynamic and self-loathing lyric, fit snugly into the post-Nirvana alt-rock landscape-- no surprise: Radiohead copped as much from 80s indie rock as their Pac NW brethren did. Yet instead of being hamstrung by platinum success, Radiohead abandoned careerist moves for artistic ambitions, moving quickly to incorporate the record-collector's music of post-rock and Mo Wax, the post-dance, spiritually nurturing end of UK rock, and the pre-millennial tension of IDM and trip-hop.</p>
<p>By the end of the 90s, Radiohead hadn't supplanted U2, R.E.M., Oasis, and Metallica as the world's biggest rock band. But it was largely agreed upon that they were the world's best-- and with hindsight, arguably, along with the White Stripes, the last indie-friendly group to conquer the world and punch in the same weight class as early 90s alt-rock giants like Nine Inch Nails, Pearl Jam, Green Day, or Red Hot Chili Peppers. That they used this critical and commercial currency to such dazzling effect on <i>Kid A</i> and <i>Amnesiac</i> is still one of the highlights of this decade; that the press, especially in the UK, chose the more familiar and necrophiliac ""new rock revolution"" over the relatively pioneering Radiohead is one of the decade's lows.</p>
<p>UK rock, for all its heady artistry and visionaries throughout the 60s, 70s, and 80s, had been slumming it a bit when Radiohead first emerged. Size and grandeur, which would become the goals for too many UK guitar bands by the end of the Britpop era, were largely missing from that country's indie scene when Radiohead started recording in 1992. Sure, the Stone Roses had trumpeted their own greatness a few years earlier, but most of the era's indie music was introspective, bands content to gaze at their shoes rather than aim for the back of the venue.</p>

The thoughtful, earnest, and unapologetically cerebral Bostonian might be a prototypical ""rapper that liberal arts kids like,"" but he's also ferociously on-point and prodigiously skilled. His last full-length, <i>Mo'Mega</i>, winningly mixed warnings about government conspiracies and mind control with disarming odes to his unborn children and truly unexpected feminine-hygiene advice. On new album <i>I Heard It Today</i>, he takes this autobiographical tack a step further, fashioning each song as a sort of unfiltered blog-entry reaction to the news as it happens. He wrote, recorded, and released to blogs the songs on the record over the course of fall 2008, as the economy plummeted, election fever set in, and Barack Obama won the Presidency. Lif's intentions-- to heat up his politics with personal immediacy-- are admirable, but the result, unfortunately, recreates a bit too successfully how it might feel to read a Mr. Lif Huffington Post column.</p>
<p>The successes and failures divide pretty evenly into songs that benefit from the sense they were spilled out in one long breath and ones that feel like they were written on a napkin minutes before recording. ""Welcome to the World"" and ""What About Us?"" were penned, as Lif tells us in the liner notes, as responses to the collapse of the world economy and the bailout plan, respectively, and they are sincerely aggrieved, gut-level blasts that benefit from the surging beats (by some dude named, no joke, Batsauce) that nicely recreate the sort of muscular apocalypse-rap Lif was rhyming over on the <i>Emergency Rations EP</i>. Other songs fall prey to the Cornel West rap-album-as-seminar problem, where Lif get so worked up he sort of forgets he's supposed to be rapping: ""It hurts that even our most prestigious leaders cannot shun what these centuries of hatred have done"" or ""They were willing to give people with bad credit loans because they knew within a few years, we're out of our homes and they can buy up all the same properties"" might be salient points, but they don't exactly make for natural-sounding lines.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the other problem: Lif's always had passion and verbal dexterity to burn, but his lyrics typically don't offer much that you can't gather from your first Propagandhi album or an Alan Moore graphic novel. It doesn't help that he still insists on saying things like ""We should use our mind power to collapse the walls."" He also remains touchingly convinced that his decision to wear dreadlocks is controversial in any way, shape, or form: ""While I'm walking down the street, I see it all the time/ People looking at me like my dreads are a crime/ They signify the fact that I refuse to conform/ And I rock 'em real thick, cuz I'm allergic to the norm."" His most thoughtful moment on <i>I Heard It Today</i> comes on ""Head High"", where his indignation cools a bit and and he gets reflective: ""It hurts me to the marrow when I drive through the ghetto/ And see my peoples caught up in a life that won't let go/ And what's weird is/Few of them will hear this/ Melody I'm pouring from my heart so fearless."" It's moments like these that make Lif so appealing: he might be touring the Seven Sisters college circuit for the rest of his career, but he embraces his turf wholeheartedly and raps with palpable zeal and conviction. Unfortunately, the ratio of thoughtful zeal to clunky screed this time around is decidedly not in his favor.</p></div>"|12930.0|http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12930-i-heard-it-today/|5.3|Jayson Greene
